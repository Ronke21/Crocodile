<doc id="593025" wikidata="Q1336674" url="?curid=593025" title="The Liberator (newspaper)">
<text>The Liberator (1831–1865) was a weekly abolitionist newspaper, printed and published in Boston by William Lloyd Garrison and, through 1839, by Isaac Knapp. Religious rather than political, it appealed to the moral conscience of its readers, urging them to demand immediate freeing of the slaves (&quot;immediatism&quot;). It also promoted women&#x27;s rights, an issue that split the American abolitionist movement. Despite its modest circulation of 3,000, it had prominent and influential readers, including all the abolitionist leaders, among them Frederick Douglass, Beriah Green, Arthur and Lewis Tappan, and Alfred Niger. It frequently printed or reprinted letters, reports, sermons, and news stories relating to American slavery, becoming a sort of community bulletin board for the new abolitionist movement that Garrison helped foster.

== History ==

Garrison co-published weekly issues of &quot;The Liberator&quot; from Boston continuously for 35 years, from January 1, 1831, to the final issue of December 29, 1865. Although its circulation was only about 3,000, and three-quarters of subscribers (in 1834) were African Americans, the newspaper earned nationwide notoriety for its uncompromising advocacy of &quot;immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves&quot; in the United States. Garrison set the tone for the paper in his famous open letter &quot;To the Public&quot; in the first issue:

 Rather than looking to politics to create change, Garrison utilized nonviolent means, such as moral suasion, as his message throughout the newspaper. Garrison felt that slavery was a moral issue and used his way of writing to appeal to the morality of his readers as an attempt to influence them into changing their morally questionable ways. For example, &quot;No Union with Slave-Holders&quot; was a slogan utilized for weeks at a time throughout the newspaper&#x27;s publication, advocating that the North should leave the Union.

&quot;The Liberator&quot; continued for three decades from its founding through the end of the American Civil War. It had black columnists and reporters. Garrison ended the newspaper&#x27;s run with a valedictory column at the end of 1865, when the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery throughout the United States. It was succeeded by &quot;The Nation&quot;.

==Women&#x27;s rights advocacy==
Between January 7, 1832 and May 4, 1833, the &quot;Liberator&quot; published six articles by Maria W. Stewart, an abolitionist and one of the first American women to lecture before mixed-race and mixed-gender audiences.

The &quot;Liberator&quot; also became an avowed women&#x27;s rights newspaper when the prospectus for its 1838 issue declared that as the paper&#x27;s objective was &quot;to redeem woman as well as man from a servile to an equal condition,&quot; it would support &quot;the rights of woman to their utmost extent.&quot; In January and February 1838, the &quot;Liberator&quot; published Sarah Grimké&#x27;s &quot;Letters on the Province of Woman&quot;, and later that year published them as a book, to another of Garrison and Knapp&#x27;s projects Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. During the following decades, the &quot;Liberator&quot; promoted women&#x27;s rights by publishing editorials, petitions, convention calls and proceedings, speeches, legislative action, and other material advocating women&#x27;s suffrage, equal property rights, and women&#x27;s educational and professional equality. The &quot;Liberator&quot;″s printers, Isaac Knapp, James Brown Yerrinton (1800–1866) and James Manning Winchell Yerrinton (1825–1893), and Robert Folger Wallcut (1797–1884), printed many of the women&#x27;s rights tracts of the 1850s.

== Inspiration among abolitionists ==

The &quot;Liberator&quot; inspired abolitionist Angelina Grimké to publicly join the abolitionist movement. She sent a letter to William Lloyd Garrison recalling her experiences as a member of an upper class, white, slaveholding family. Angelina Grimké&#x27;s letter to William Lloyd Garrison was soon after published in &quot;The Liberator&quot;.

Frederick Douglass was at first inspired by &quot;The Liberator.&quot; As he commented upon in his first issue of &quot;The North Star,&quot; Douglass felt that it was necessary for African Americans, such as himself, to speak out about their own experiences with injustice. He claimed that those that experienced injustice were the ones that must demand justice. Soon after, Douglass began writing his own abolitionist newspaper, &quot;The North Star.&quot; By 1851 Douglass broke bitterly with Garrison and now worked for abolition and equality through the U.S. Constitution and political system.

in 1836, five years after he agreed to be &quot;The Liberator&quot;&#x27;s agent in Rhode Island, Alfred Niger helped to found the Rhode Island Anti-Slavery Society, one of only two Black men in the entire organization.

== Resistance ==
What changed &quot;The Liberator&quot; from a small abolitionist organ to a national one was the attention paid to it in the South. Southern papers reprinted and editorialized its articles and announcements, thus bringing them further to the attention of Northern readers and editors.

&quot;The Liberator&quot; faced harsh resistance from several state legislatures and local groups: for example, North Carolina indicted Garrison for felonious acts, and the Vigilance Association of Columbia, South Carolina, offered a reward of $1,500 () to those who identified distributors of the paper.

Garrison also faced resistance, even to the point of violence. In 1835, a Boston mob formed with support from local newspapers in resistance to the announcement that George Thompson would speak at the first anniversary meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society. The mob, unable to find Thompson, redirected their aggression towards Garrison who was in the society&#x27;s meeting hall. Eventually escalation of the situation led to destruction of the society&#x27;s antislavery sign, and even calls to lynch Garrison, around whose neck a piece of rope made into a noose was put. Garrison eventually managed a narrow escape; the mayor put him in the city jail for his protection.

<text>Pyramid Breweries, Inc., is a defunct brewing company that produced beer under the Pyramid brand name at two breweries and several brewpubs in Washington, Oregon, and California. It was founded in 1984 as Hart Brewing. The brand name is currently owned by North American Breweries, a subsidiary of the Costa Rican company Florida Ice &amp; Farm Co.

==History==
Hart Brewing was founded by Tom Baune and Beth Hartwell in 1984 in Kalama, Washington. A pioneer of craft brewing in the Pacific Northwest, Hart&#x27;s signature beer was Pyramid Pale Ale, which it followed with Pyramid Wheaten Ale in 1985. In 1994, Hart debuted the Apricot Ale, a fruit beer that quickly became its most prominent brand. The company opened new facilities and greatly expanded its production, and changed its name to Pyramid Breweries in 1996. It also started experimenting with other styles, which won a number of brewing competitions in the U.S. and abroad. Eventually it grew to become one of the five largest craft brewers in the country.

Pyramid eventually stopped brewing in Kalama in favor of other locations, but maintained its headquarters in Seattle. In 2004, Pyramid acquired Portland Brewing Company, makers of the MacTarnahan&#x27;s brand. In 2008, the company was itself purchased by Independent Brewers United, the parent company of Magic Hat Brewing Company of Burlington, Vermont. Magic Hat maintained the Seattle office and the Pyramid and MacTarnahan&#x27;s facilities and products. Two years later, the joint company was acquired by North American Breweries of Rochester, New York. In December 2012, the parent company was purchased by Cerveceria Costa Rica, a unit of the Costa Rican company Florida Ice &amp; Farm Co.

==Beers==
Pyramid once featured beers including, ales, lager, weizens, ciders, porters, and IPAs. The company offered six year-round beers, including Hefeweizen, Apricot Ale, Thunderhead IPA and Outburst Imperial IPA. Pyramid also offered seasonal beers, including Curve Ball Blonde Ale, Oktoberfest and Snow Cap Winter Warmer, along with seasonal variety packs and limited release beers.

==Facilities, alehouses, and closures==
Pyramid ran three brewpub restaurants dubbed &quot;Alehouses&quot;: one near the brewery, one in Seattle, and a small outlet in the Oakland International Airport. The Alehouse in Sacramento, California, closed its doors in March 2013, the Berkeley location closed in 2015, and the Walnut Creek location closed in early 2016. In 2019, the Seattle Alehouse settled a class action lawsuit for $450,000 over unpaid hours and wage theft. Less than a year later, on May 1, 2020, Pyramid Alehouse announced it was permanently closing the Seattle location, citing a lack of “high volume sporting and entertainment events” in the wake of the Covid-19 Pandemic that, before, would “off-set the much slower restaurant business during non-peak times.” On January 8, 2021, Portland Brewing Company announced that the brewery would cease all operations.

<doc id="593030" wikidata="Q3149430" url="?curid=593030" title="Impiety">
<text>Impiety is a perceived lack of proper respect for something considered sacred. Impiety is often closely associated with sacrilege, though it is not necessarily a physical action. Impiety cannot be associated with a cult, as it implies a larger belief system was disrespected. One of the Pagan objections to Christianity was that, unlike other mystery religions, early Christians refused to cast a pinch of incense before the images of the gods, an impious act in their eyes. Impiety in ancient civilizations was a civic concern, rather than solely religious (as religions were tied into the state). It was believed that impious actions such as disrespect towards sacred objects or priests could bring down the wrath of the gods.

==Ancient Greece==

The issue of impiety in antiquity is very controversial because of the anecdotal nature of extant sources. A number of Athenian men, including Alcibiades, were sentenced to death for impiety in 415 BC, most of whom fled Athens before execution (Andocides was later charged in 400 or 399 BC in reference to these events). Most famously, the philosopher Socrates was executed for impiety (as well as corrupting Athenian youth) in 399 BC. An Athenian philosopher Anaxagoras taught that the sun and the stars were fiery stones whose heat we did not feel because of their distance, and was allegedly accused of impiety in Athens. Diagoras of Melos was reportedly accused of atheism and had to flee Athens after being charged with impiety for revealing the content of the Eleusinian mysteries to the uninitiated. Philosophers Aristotle and Theophrastus might have been accused of impiety as well. Phryne was put on trial for impiety and was defended by the orator Hypereides; she was acquitted.

<text>During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, politiques () were Western European statesmen who prioritized the strength of the state above all other organs of society, including religion. During the French Wars of Religion, this included moderates of both religious faiths (Huguenots and Catholics) who held that the country could only be saved by the restoration of a strong monarchy which rose above religious differences. The term &quot;politique&quot; often had a pejorative connotation of moral or religious indifference, especially after 1576 in contrast with the radical Catholic League calling for the eradication of Protestantism in France. By 1588, the &quot;politiques&quot; were seen by pious detractors as a faction more pernicious than heretics. Similar clashes emerged during the same period in the Netherlands and England.

==History==
In early critical writings, the &quot;politiques&quot; (largely jurists and intellectuals) were sometimes confused with another group, the &quot;malcontents&quot; (nobles who opposed the political influence of the Guise family). Many moderate &quot;politique&quot; Catholics defended the idea of Gallicanism, of making a distinction between the State and Religion, of a unitary and undivided royal sovereignty (against exterior influence or internal divisions), and of privileging national security and peace.

It can be argued that anyone who believed in the necessity of a strong monarchy to national security was a &quot;politique&quot;. For example, the &quot;politique&quot; policies of Henry IV of France, such as the Edict of Nantes (a document granting political and religious liberties to the minority French Protestants), directly contributed to the centralized administrative system of seventeenth century France and the absolutism embodied by Louis XIV of France, which included an eventual revocation of the Edict. Another example of a politique was Elizabeth I of England, who was (or claimed to be) a Catholic during the time of her sister Mary I but moved to Protestantism when attaining the throne. The later monarch Charles II - long flirting with Catholicism and holding out a promise to convert to it as a means of getting support from Louis XIV of France, but only actually converting on his deathbed - could also be considered to have acted as a Politique, though by his time the term was less often used. 

Jonathan I. Israel emphasizes the important role played by various &quot;Politiques&quot; in the Dutch Revolt of the 16th Century and the 17th Century Dutch Republic created by that revolt. Specifically, he notes as the most important of them William the Silent, who moved from the Catholic Church to the Calvinist one - the opposite direction to that taken by his contemporary Henry IV of France, but taken out of similar motives. In Jonathan Israel&#x27;s view, the long-term influence of such Dutch Politiques was positive, helping to mitigate the more intransigent forms of Calvinism and to create in the Netherlands a climate of (relative) religious toleration, greater than in other European countries at the time. Likewise, Blair Worden makes the point that during the Commonwealth of England, while the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell was broadly Calvinist, his circle contained non-sectarian ‘merciful men’ or politiques who were more tolerant of other doctrines.

<text>The 2001–02 season was the 122nd season of competitive football in England.

==Events==

===Arsenal cruise to title glory===
In what had earlier been one of the most closely fought Premiership title races for years, Arsenal won the championship by a seven-point margin. Their crown was won in the penultimate game of the season when they beat defending champions Manchester United 1–0 at Old Trafford. Four days earlier, they had also won the FA Cup with a 2–0 victory over Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.

Their top scorer, Thierry Henry, was on target 24 times in the league alone.

One downside to the season was Arsenal&#x27;s failure to progress to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League.

===Sir Alex puts off his retirement===
Sir Alex Ferguson announced in February that he would be postponing his retirement as Manchester United manager by at least three more seasons after he signed a new contract as manager. The news came just after United completed an impressive revival in the Premiership which saw them rise from ninth to first in the space of two months.

On 8 December, United stood ninth in the Premiership – 11 points behind Liverpool, who had a game in hand – and had lost five of their seven previous games in the aftermath of a 1–0 defeat at home to West Ham United. Even a UEFA Cup place appeared beyond reach. An eight-match winning run, however, saw United cruise to the top of the Premiership and they were soon challenging a three-horse race with Liverpool and Arsenal. They remained in the title race until the penultimate game of the season, when they lost 1–0 at home to Arsenal and surrendered the title crown to their opponents.

United&#x27;s failure was largely put down to the inability to find a suitable replacement for Jaap Stam, the Dutch central defender who had been sold to Lazio for £16.25 million just after the start of the season. Another disappointment was the failure of Juan Sebastián Verón, at £28.1 million the most expensive player ever to sign for an English club, to never live up to his hefty price tag. On a positive note, Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy lived up to his £19 million price tag by scoring 34 goals in all competitions during his first season at Old Trafford, breaking the club record that had been set by Dennis Viollet 40 seasons earlier.

After the season concluded, rumours began to circulate that Ferguson was about to break the English transfer record once again and sign Leeds United central-back Rio Ferdinand in the hope that his side would return to their winning ways in 2002–03.

===Ipswich fall from grace===
A year after qualifying for the UEFA Cup and earning George Burley the Manager of the Year award, Ipswich Town dropped back into Division One. The Suffolk side had looked doomed by Christmas after winning just one of their first 18 Premiership games. Then came a turnaround in form which saw them win seven out of eight fixtures and climb to 12th place, suggesting that they were safe. But another decline set in, and this time Ipswich were unable to halt it. Their relegation was confirmed with a 5–0 defeat away to runners-up Liverpool on the final day of the season.

Joining Ipswich in Division One would be already doomed Derby County and Leicester City, both going down after six seasons in the Premiership, the last of which had seen three different men take charge of the team.

===West Brom and Birmingham back in the big time===
West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City, who had last played in the top flight in 1985–86, were finally promoted back to the top division with Albion as Division One runners-up and Birmingham as playoff winners. Albion had overtaken another local rival in Wolverhampton Wanderers, which had been out of the top flight even longer, in the race for the run for second place by winning seven of their final nine league games. Birmingham&#x27;s triumph was sealed by a penalty-shoot out win over Norwich at the Millennium Stadium. They followed champions Manchester City, managed by Kevin Keegan, into the Premiership.

====The Battle of Bramall Lane====

One of the seven Albion wins in their promotion run came on 16 March 2002, against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. This match would turn into one of the most ill-tempered in recent English football history, with three United players sent off, two of them for violent conduct in the second half. The match was abandoned with Albion up 3–0 after two other United players came up injured, reducing them to six players. Ultimately, The FA let the 3–0 scoreline stand.

===Back to back for Brighton===
Brighton &amp; Hove Albion secured successive title winning promotions. This was a massive turnaround for the fortunes of the club which had between 1996 and 1998 finished second bottom of the football league and were on the verge of going out of business.

===ITV Digital crisis plunges league clubs into turmoil===
The collapse of debt-ridden ITV Digital in May 2002 plunged many Football League clubs into turmoil. The likes of Bradford City, Bury, Nottingham Forest, Watford, Barnsley, Lincoln City and Port Vale filed for administration, fearful that the drastic loss of revenue would put them out of business.

Of all the troubled clubs, Bradford City&#x27;s situation was the most precarious. The West Yorkshire club had debts of £36million and had failed to meet a deadline for a takeover deal. It seemed inevitable that the Bantams, who had gone into liquidation in 1983, would endure a total collapse and lose their place in the Football League. Their only hope was for the Football League to ignore their financial plight and allow them a place in Division One for the 2002–03 season.

===Dario reaches managerial milestone===
On 20 November 2001, Dario Gradi took charge of his 1,000 competitive game in charge of Crewe Alexandra in Division One. Gradi had arrived at Crewe in June 1983, and he reached this landmark just four months into a season which had already seen a total of more than 20 managerial changes in the Premiership, Division One, Division Two and Division Three. Crewe ended the season by being relegated to Division Two but the club&#x27;s directors showed no intention of parting company with the longest-serving manager at any Football League club.

===Wimbledon get go-ahead for Milton Keynes move===

Just after the end of the Division one season, a three-man panel of The FA gave permission for Wimbledon FC to move from their historic South London home to Milton Keynes. The move sparked outrage among Wimbledon supporters, who formed their own club – AFC Wimbledon – in response to the controversial plans of chairman Charles Koppel.

==League tables==

===FA Premier League===

Arsenal won their second Premier League title in five seasons, as well as their second double in the same period, after a remarkable season in which they fought with the rest of the top six for the title right up until the final stages. They scored in every Premier League game, were unbeaten away from home, and finished the league season with 13 successive wins – and also had the satisfaction of clinching the title with a win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in their penultimate game. Liverpool&#x27;s second-place finish was their highest for 11 years, ending Manchester United&#x27;s top-two run which had started after theirs had ended. United had rallied well and led the league for a while after losing six league games between mid September and early December, but dropped points in the final two months of the season left them ten points behind Arsenal at the season&#x27;s end. Newcastle United finished fourth, their highest position for five years, in their third season under the management of 69-year-old Bobby Robson.

Leeds United and Chelsea had to settle for UEFA Cup qualification after losing ground in the closing stages of the title race. Leeds&#x27;s failure to qualify for the Champions League would trigger a financial implosion that would eventually see them relegated to the third tier and almost be expelled from the Football League within five years.

For the first time in 12 years, all three newly-promoted sides avoided relegation. Blackburn Rovers fared the best, finishing 10th and winning the League Cup, thereby qualifying for the UEFA Cup. Fulham survived relatively comfortably, though a 13th-place finish was considered underwhelming, as their being managed by the highly regarded Jean Tigana and a substantial investment in players had caused most pundits to tip them to challenge for the European spots. Bolton Wanderers&#x27; strong start to the season meant that they survived in 16th place, despite their lacklustre form for much of the rest of the season.

Leicester City&#x27;s final season at Filbert Street, their home for 111 years, ended in relegation after just five league game wins. Joining them in Division One were their local rivals Derby County, who had been promoted alongside them six years earlier. Derby had finished not far above the relegation zone in the previous two campaigns, but Leicester had been a top 10 side as recently as two years before their relegation, when they had also won their second League Cup in four seasons.

Last to go down were Ipswich Town, who had revived themselves mid-season after a disastrous start, but were unable to halt it after another slide towards the end of the campaign and any hopes of survival were ended on the final day of the season when they were crushed by Liverpool, just one year after qualifying for Europe (albeit they would return to Europe via the Fair Play Award). Sunderland, who had fallen just one place short of Europe in the previous two seasons, came just one place away from relegation.
Leading goalscorer: Thierry Henry (Arsenal), 24

===First Division===
Manchester City managed to make an immediate return from the previous season&#x27;s relegation, and returned to the Premier League as champions. West Bromwich Albion built on their surprise play-off appearance the previous year, achieving automatic promotion to the top-flight for the first time since 1986 at the expense of local rivals Wolves, who had looked all set for promotion just weeks earlier, but went out of the playoffs against Norwich. The play-offs were won by Birmingham City, finally earning promotion after two successive disappointments, and also returning to the top flight for the first time since 1986.

Burnley finished seventh for the second season running, only missing out on the playoffs on goal difference. Local rivals Preston finished eighth, with former Scotland manager Craig Brown now at the helm after David Moyes left for Everton.

Stockport County endured a dismal season despite the high-profile appointment of Carlton Palmer as manager, and fell into Division Two. Barnsley also went down, despite a play-off final appearance only two years previously. The final relegation spot was filled by Crewe, who for once were unable to pull off a survival act.

Top Goalscorer: Shaun Goater (Manchester City) – 28

===Second Division===
Brighton earned a second successive championship, despite the loss of manager Micky Adams early in the season – however, they would also have to cope with the loss of replacement manager Peter Taylor after the season ended. Reading earned the runners-up spot after four seasons in Division Two, and the play-offs were won by Stoke City who, despite this success, sacked manager Gudjon Thordarson immediately afterwards (leaving Reading in the odd position of being the only top six side to start the 2002–03 season with the same manager that they had at the start of the 2001–02 season).

QPR came out of administration at the end of a season where they finished a respectable eighth in their first campaign at this level since the 1960s, featuring in the race for a playoff place until the penultimate game of the season. Wigan Athletic finished a disappointing tenth after successive playoff appearances, but kept faith in manager Paul Jewell to deliver promotion in his second season at the helm.

Cambridge United were cut adrift early in the season, and never looked to have much chance of surviving. Long-time Division Two members Wrexham never recovered from a bad start, and also went down. Bury suffered a financial crisis off the pitch and the effects of this ultimately affected the team&#x27;s performance and sent them down to the League&#x27;s bottom tier. The final relegation spot was filled by AFC Bournemouth.

Leading goalscorer: Bobby Zamora (Brighton and Hove Albion) – 28

===Third Division===
Plymouth and Luton were involved in a close fight for the divisional title for the whole season; ultimately Plymouth won out, with Luton taking the runners-up spot and making an immediate return to Division Two after going down the previous season. The third automatic spot was closely contested between Mansfield and Cheltenham; Mansfield were the ultimate victors despite some poor results late in the season, but Cheltenham would win promotion anyway through the play-offs.

This was the final season where only a single team would drop out of the League into the Conference. Ultimately there proved to be little drama about who would go down, as it became obvious from the first few weeks that Halifax Town were doomed, never managing to earn enough wins to have any serious chance of survival.

Leading goalscorer: Steve Howard (Luton Town) – 24

*31 March 2002 – The Premier League title race remains in full swing as March draws to a close. Liverpool are now top, Manchester United are second, and Arsenal are third, though Arsenal are two points off the top with two games in hand. The threat from the other top six clubs – Chelsea, Leeds United and Newcastle United – is now virtually non existent. Meanwhile, Leicester City&#x27;s relegation is looking almost certain, while they and Derby County have been joined in the relegation zone by an Ipswich Town side whose resurgence in late winter appeared to have saved their Premier League status.

Sunderland confirm their survival with a 1–1 home draw against already relegated Derby County.

<text>Hugh Michael Horace Dancy (born 19 June 1975) is an English actor who rose to prominence for his role as the title character in the television film adaptation of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (2000) as well as for roles in feature films as Kurt Schmid in &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (2001) and Prince Charmont in &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; (2004). Other film roles include Joe Conner in &quot;Shooting Dogs&quot; (2005), Grigg Harris in &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot; (2007), Luke Brandon in &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; (2009), Adam Raki in &quot;Adam&quot; (2009) and Ted in &quot;Martha Marcy May Marlene&quot; (2011). On television, he portrayed criminal profiler Will Graham in the NBC television series &quot;Hannibal&quot; (2013–2015), Cal Roberts in the Hulu original series &quot;The Path&quot; (2016–2018) and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, in the Channel 4 miniseries &quot;Elizabeth I&quot; (2005); the latter role earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. Dancy currently portrays Senior Assistant District Attorney Nolan Price on NBC&#x27;s revival of the original &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (2022–present).

==Early life==
Dancy was born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, and raised in Newcastle-under-Lyme. His mother, Sarah Ann Dancy (née Birley, born 1952), works in academic publishing. His father is philosophy professor Jonathan Dancy (born 1946), who teaches at the University of Reading and at the University of Texas at Austin.

Hugh is the oldest of three children, followed by brother Jack Dancy (born 1977), who is co-director of the travel company Trufflepig Travel, and sister Katharine Sarah Redman (née Dancy, born 1980), who works for UNESCO. From the age of 5 to the age of 10, Dancy was educated at Edenhurst Preparatory School in Newcastle-under-Lyme. At age 10, Dancy attended boarding school at the Dragon School in Oxford, then, at 13 at Winchester College. At age 18, he acted in the Winchester College Players production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, which was performed in both Winchester and at the Minack Theatre in Cornwall. He went on to study English at St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford.

==Career==
After graduation, Dancy moved to London, where a chance conversation in a cafe led to his meeting casting director Ros Hubbard and agent Dallas Smith, who signed him. In 1999, Dancy appeared in the second series of &quot;Cold Feet&quot; in the role of Danny, who had a fleeting romance with Rachel, one of the show&#x27;s main characters. In 2002, Dancy played Daniel Deronda in the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of George Eliot&#x27;s novel &quot;Daniel Deronda&quot;.

Notable roles from film include Dancy&#x27;s Prince Charmont from the 2004 film &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; alongside Anne Hathaway and, from the same year, Galahad in &quot;King Arthur&quot; alongside later &quot;Hannibal&quot; co-star Mads Mikkelsen. In 2005, he starred as Adam Raki in &quot;Adam&quot;, an independent film which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2009 and follows the story of a young man with autism. He went on to appear in various other films.

In theatre, Dancy has appeared in MCC Theater&#x27;s &quot;The Pride&quot;, written by Alexi Kaye Campbell, at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in New York City. The off-Broadway production was directed by Joe Mantello and co-starred Ben Whishaw and Andrea Riseborough. In 2007, Dancy had a starring role on Broadway as Captain Dennis Stanhope in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (Belasco Theatre). From 2010 until 2011, he starred in Manhattan Theatre Club&#x27;s Broadway production of &quot;Venus in Fur&quot; alongside Nina Arianda. His performance was praised by &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic Charles Isherwood. In August 2018, it was announced he would appear with Stockard Channing in Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s off-Broadway premiere of &quot;Apologia&quot;, written by Alexi Kay Campbell, in the dual roles of Peter and Simon.

In March 2012, NBC announced that Dancy had been cast as Will Graham in &quot;Hannibal&quot;, the television adaptation based on the main character of Thomas Harris&#x27; 1981 novel &quot;Red Dragon&quot;. The show received critical acclaim and was nominated for numerous awards. It was cancelled after three seasons and concluded in 2015, though there are hopes for its revival. From 2016 to 2018, he appeared for three seasons as Cal Roberts, a lead character in Hulu&#x27;s &quot;The Path&quot;, alongside Aaron Paul and Michelle Monaghan. In November 2021 Dancy was announced as one of the leads in NBC&#x27;s 2022 revival of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, playing an assistant district attorney.

==Personal life==
In 2006, Dancy met American actress Claire Danes on the set of &quot;Evening&quot;. They announced their engagement in February 2009 and married in France later that year. They have three children: two sons born in 2012 and 2018, and a daughter born in 2023.

They live in the West Village neighbourhood of New York City.

<doc id="593060" wikidata="Q4942982" url="?curid=593060" title="Book entry">
<text>Book entry is a system of tracking ownership of securities where no certificate is given to investors. Several terms are often used interchangeably with &quot;book entry&quot; shares including &quot;paperless shares&quot;, &quot;electronic shares&quot;, &quot;digital shares&quot;, &quot;digital stock certificates&quot;, and &quot;uncertificated shares&quot;. Some of these terms have somewhat different connotations but, at least in the United States, state securities laws only recognize certificated and uncertificated shares. In the case of book-entry-only (BEO) issues, while investors do not receive certificates, a custodian holds one or more global certificates. Dematerialized securities, in contrast, are ones in which no certificates exist; instead, the security issuer, its agent or a central securities depository keeps records, usually electronically of who holds outstanding securities.

Most investors who use an online broker or even a regular full-service broker will have their shares held in book-entry form. This is generally convenient, as one does not have to preserve physical stock certificates, and can buy/sell securities without turning certificates in or having new ones issued. Also, replacement costs for certificates are high in case one loses them, while book-entry ownership can never be lost thanks to technological backups.

==Direct Registration System==

On August 8, 2006, the SEC approved a rule changed by NASDAQ, NYSE and AMEX requiring all listed securities (except certain debt securities) to be eligible for a direct registration system (&quot;DRS&quot;) as of March 31, 2008. DRS is an entirely electronic book-entry style system that does not involve physical stock certificates. The rule change does not eliminate physical certificates, but requires issuers to be eligible for entirely electronic recording of securities ownership.

==Private companies==
Adoption of book-entry systems among private companies has lagged adoption among public companies, public company transfer agents, and broker-dealers. This may be due to a number of misunderstandings and challenges unique to private company security issuance but, regardless, data suggest adoption of book-entry systems among private companies is growing rapidly.

<doc id="593069" wikidata="Q3157432" url="?curid=593069" title="Jackson Park (Chicago)">
<text>Jackson Park is a urban park on the shore of Lake Michigan on the South Side of Chicago. Straddling the Hyde Park, Woodlawn, and South Shore neighborhoods, the park was designed in 1871 by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux and remodeled in 1893 to serve as the site of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. It is one of the largest and most historically significant parks in the city, and many of the park&#x27;s features are mementos of the fair—including the Garden of the Phoenix, the Statue of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Republic&quot;, and the Museum of Science and Industry.

The parkland that would become Jackson Park was originally developed as part of an unrealized addition to the Chicago park and boulevard system, other parts of which include Washington Park and Midway Plaisance. Initially called Lake Park, it was renamed in 1880 in honor of Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States. The aquatic islands and lagoons have since been developed to include boat harbors, playing fields, prairie restoration, a golf course, and three beaches. The park also hosts the Barack Obama Presidential Center and La Rabida Children&#x27;s Hospital.

==History==
===World&#x27;s Fair===


After the state legislature created the South Park Commission in 1869, the designers of New York&#x27;s Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, were hired to lay out the park, which included the Midway Plaisance and Washington Park. Lois Willie explained in her book &quot;Forever Open, Clear, and Free&quot;, &quot;Olmstead said Jackson Park should be water oriented, with a yacht harbor, winding walkways around the lagoons, small bridges, bathing pavilions, and plenty of space for boating.&quot; However, their designs were not put into place at that time, and Jackson Park remained untouched until Chicago was chosen to host the World&#x27;s Fair several years later. One of the landmarks that recalls the 1893 Columbian Exposition is the Statue of &quot;The Republic&quot;, only it is now a replica one-third the size of the original &quot;The Republic&quot; statue. The designers used the Statue of Liberty as inspiration when they were creating the original. Today the 1/3 size statue of &quot;The Republic&quot; stands at the site of the 1893 Expositions Administration Building.

Known originally as &quot;South Park&quot;, the landscape had eastern and western divisions connected by a grand boulevard named the Midway Plaisance. The eastern division became known as &quot;Lake Park&quot;; however, in 1880 the commission asked the public to suggest official names for both the eastern and western divisions. The names &quot;Jackson&quot; and &quot;Washington&quot; were proposed. In the following year, Lake Park was renamed &quot;Jackson Park&quot; to honor Andrew Jackson (1767–1845), the seventh president of the United States.

In 1890, Chicago won the honor of hosting the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. In 1891, Jackson Park was selected as its site. Olmsted and Chicago&#x27;s architect and planner, Daniel H. Burnham, with his partner John Wellborn Root, laid out the fairgrounds. A team of architects and sculptors created the &quot;White City&quot; of plaster buildings and artworks in Beaux-Arts style. The historic World&#x27;s Fair opened to visitors on May 1, 1893. It was Root&#x27;s last project, as he caught pneumonia and died in January 1891, two years before the fair&#x27;s opening. After most of the fair buildings burned down, the site was transformed back into parkland, as the fair buildings were not designed to be permanent structures.

Jackson Park featured the first public golf course west of the Alleghenies, which opened in 1899. Colonel B. J. D. Irwin, a retired military surgeon and local golfer, sought democratization of recreation in Chicago, and ensured that Jackson Park Golf Course be made open to the public for free, such that &quot;golfers of limited means... can play at almost nominal cost, and cheaper facilities in Chicago would permit of a number enjoying the game who at present are debarred by the dues demanded by the local clubs&quot;.

===Intervening years===

Most of the park burned to the ground after the fair closed. A headline from January 9. 1894 read, &quot;THE WHITE CITY IN FLAMES; FIRE DESTROYS THE FAIREST OF THE BEAUTIFUL BUILDINGS&quot;.

On May 16, 1896, the Jackson Park Yacht Club (JPYC) was organized with incorporation on June 3 but the original organization failed. Rights to the club were purchased and a new JPYC was formed with thirty-eight members with about twenty boats. The Park Commission&#x27;s aid was sought to dredge and clear a channel through the wreckage of the exposition.

By 1901 membership had expanded to 149 with 105 boats. By 1902, with the club house built of scrap lumber on a purchased scow, the club joined the Lake Michigan Yachting Association. Over the next years, the club grew in membership and in competitive yachts. By 1915, plans were underway for a new club house with sixteen life memberships the core of the funding for the new structure which was dedicated on Memorial Day 1916 by Governor Edward F. Dunne, who arrived on William A. Lydon&#x27;s 181-foot steam yacht .

On July 17, 1916, zoologist and philosopher J. Howard Moore killed himself on Jackson Park&#x27;s Wooded Island. He regularly visited there to study birds.

The Palace of Fine Arts decayed after the fair until it was reopened as the Museum of Science and Industry in 1933. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company president Julius Rosenwald donated the initial investment. During World War II, vandals severely damaged the Japanese Garden. The Chicago Park District waited for decades before considering repairing it. Eventually, the city of Osaka donated money for the refurbishment.

During the Cold War, part of Jackson Park contained a Nike Surface-to-Air Missile site and the nearby point was used as its radar station.

In the 1950s, the Wooded Island was almost leased to the Army to become the location of an anti-aircraft installation, but was strongly protested against, as the Park District had given the Army other location options and the Wooded Island was spared.

In 1965, the people of South Chicago were growing tired of the traffic jams on Lake Shore Drive, so the city made plans to widen the road, straighten its curves and run it straight through Jackson Park. Women and children then conducted protests and rallies around tree stumps. The efforts eventually brought results and the city halted roadwork after it had already gone halfway through the park.

In 1972, Jackson Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The park&#x27;s East Lagoon, or Music Court Bridge was featured in the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. In the film the titular characters encounter a White Supremacist Nazi demonstration on the bridge and drive their car over the bridge regardless, forcing the Nazis to jump into the water.

=== Rehabilitation ===

A nonprofit organization called Project 120 began collaborating with the Chicago Park District in 2012 to restore Jackson Park to designer Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s vision. The group&#x27;s plans include improving the park&#x27;s green space, creating a music pavilion, and creating a great lawn for park-goers to use for leisure activities. In October 2016 Yoko Ono unveiled a permanent artwork called &quot;Skylanding&quot; on the Wooded Island; it is Ono&#x27;s first permanent art installation in the United States. Ono said she was inspired during a visit to the Garden of the Phoenix in 2013 and that she feels a connection to the city of Chicago.

Jackson Park has a number of volunteers who help maintain the park, but Project 120 aims to go beyond cleanup and plant maintenance. At a cost of about $8.1 million, habitat restoration on Jackson Park&#x27;s Wooded Island began in 2015 and will continue until 2019. Restoration will take five years to complete and another 25 years reach ecological maturity. The restoration is being done as part of the Army Corps of Engineers Great Lakes Fishery &amp; Ecosystem Restoration (GLFER) program. Improving the park&#x27;s green space and enhancing its wildlife are meant to improve the appearance and popularity of a park that has been in decline. Some aspects of the restoration, especially plans for a music pavilion, have generated controversy.

== Remaining World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition structures ==


While a comfort station and the North Pond Bridge, both of which date from the 1880s, are still in use, every structure built for World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition was long ago destroyed by fire, demolished or moved elsewhere, except for the old Palace of Fine Arts, now the Museum of Science and Industry, the only fireproof building at the fair, which fell into disrepair and was rehabilitated with a $5 million grant in 1930 from Julius Rosenwald (President of Sears, Roebuck and Co.). The only other relic from the fair still in the same location is the &quot;Osaka Garden,&quot; a Japanese strolling garden. It was reconstructed on its original site on the Wooded Island after being vandalized during World War II. (By itself, the Wooded Island is considered one of &quot;150 great places in Illinois&quot; by the American Institute of Architects.)

The only other significant building that survived the fair is the Norway Pavilion, a building now preserved at a museum called &quot;Little Norway&quot; in Blue Mounds, Wisconsin. &quot;The Viking,&quot; a replica of the ancient Viking ship &quot;The Gokstad&quot;, built at Framnes Shipyard in Sandefjord, Norway in 1892 and sailed across the Atlantic to the fair in 1893, is currently located at Good Templar Park in Geneva, Illinois.

The full-scale replica of Columbus&#x27;s flagship the &quot;Santa María&quot; rotted in the Jackson Park Yacht Basin (along Promontory Drive) near La Rabida. In May 1952, what was left of the rotting hulk was dismantled and dredged out of the Yacht Basin.

The Art Institute of Chicago also occupies a building originally constructed for the Exposition, with the intent of housing the museum upon closing of the fair; this Exposition building is the only one not located in Jackson Park. Girders from fair structures were reused in the construction of Dunns Bridge and the Sugar Creek Chapel Bridge.

==Recreational features==
Jackson Park is utilized in many ways. It comprises which include a gymnasium with three multipurpose rooms and a fitness center. Some of Jackson Park&#x27;s green features consist of a vegetable garden and a flower garden. There are also seasonal sports available, arts and crafts, tennis lessons, piano lessons, after school programs, summer day camps, and holiday themed events.

During the summer season for the Chicago Park District (Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend), the 63rd Street beach and the adjacent Lake Michigan is a destination for beachgoers. The Beach House competes with the South Shore Cultural Center and Promontory Point as South Side beachfront special-use facilities in the Park District. The park also hosts the Chicago Landmark 63rd Street Bathing Pavilion, the 18-hole Jackson Park Golf Course, two walking trails, as well as two basketball courts.

The Lakeside Lawn Bowling Club and the Chicago Croquet Club share two natural grass courts just off Lakeshore Drive and Science Avenue, to the south of the Museum of Science and Industry.

The Jackson Park Golf Course, which opened in 1900, was the first public golf course in the Midwest. It was free until 1920, and in 1925 it was named the world&#x27;s busiest golf course.

As a result of both a steady decline in the surrounding neighborhood as well as the closing of the lagoons&#x27; connection to the 59th Street inner harbor, the lagoons deteriorated. In recent years, the state and city have spent millions of dollars to revitalize the lagoons and Garden of the Phoenix, and to restore the lagoons to their original grandeur. With the recent revitalization projects and the decision by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources to stock them with fish, the lagoons have become a very popular local fishing spot.

== Garden of the Phoenix ==

Jackson Park&#x27;s Japanese gardens were originally created during the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. The pavilion was based on the Ho-o-Do (Phoenix Hall) of the Byodo-in Temple in Kyoto. The phoenix emblem was a reference to Chicago rising like the mythical firebird from the ashes of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. 
The gardens were renamed Garden of the Phoenix in 2013.
There is a koi pond within the garden.

==Wildlife==
Over 300 species of birds have been observed in Jackson Park. This includes a well-studied population of feral monk parakeets, descendants of pet birds that escaped in the 1960s. They are a bird population in much of the south and southwest sides of Chicago, including the University of Chicago campus west of Jackson Park. Over 800 species of animals, plants, and fungi have been observed in Jackson Park. Regular bird walks have been led in the park since the 1970s.

==Connections to other parks==
Jackson Park is connected by the Midway Plaisance to Washington Park (see Encyclopedia of Chicago Map). In accordance with a canal that Olmsted wanted built between the two parks, a long excavation was made on the Midway, but water has never been allowed in. It is connected to Grant Park by Burnham Park.

The Chicago Lakefront Trail (abbreviated as LFT) is an 18-mile multi-use path in Chicago, Illinois along the shore of Lake Michigan. It is popular with cyclists and joggers. From north to south, it runs through Lincoln Park, Grant Park, Burnham Park and Jackson Park.

==Site for Barack Obama Presidential Center==

In 2014, Jackson Park came under scrutiny as a member of the short list of potential sites for the Barack Obama Presidential Center. Sonya Malunda from the office of civic engagement of the University of Chicago requested a meeting with Louise Mccurry, president of the Jackson Park Advisory Council, to talk about the library. On July 27, 2016, former president Barack Obama officially selected the park to be the location where his presidential center would be built. He and Michelle Obama both stressed the importance of Chicago&#x27;s South Side as an influence in their own lives. She said, &quot;One of my greatest honors is being a proud Chicagoan, a daughter of the South Side. I still lead with that descriptor. I wear it boldly and proudly like a crown.&quot;

In an unveiling of the presidential center&#x27;s plans on May 4, 2017, the compound was revealed to incorporate the Jackson Park end of Midway Plaisance from the north (which is to be readapted into a water basin), and a 20 acre parcel of parkland and the park hockey fields to the south, where the main buildings will be predominantly located. As part of a wider plan to reclaim parkland and improve park safety, the project also necessitates the closure of South Cornell Drive between 60th and 67th Streets, a 6-lane park thoroughfare that runs along the western park lagoon and golf course from Midway Plaisance to South Shore, becoming reclaimed green space in the park.

The proposal was controversial and was subjected to challenges which took four years to resolve. Opponents said it would affect the neighborhood, displacing Black residents. Preservationists objected because the park is historic and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. That issue required a federal review, which was resolved in early 2021. In August 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request to block the construction, and ground was broken on September 28, 2021.

The Center was designed by the New York–based firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects. The focal point will be a museum tower; the center will also include a branch of the Chicago Public Library, a great lawn, a children&#x27;s play area, and several gardens. It is expected to take four years to complete and cost $830 million.

He was the eldest son of King Daru and became the heir to the throne in the year 33. He became king upon Daru&#x27;s death in 77 which was the 50th year of his reign. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records that &quot;his knowledge was vast and he did not stay his intentions with minor details&quot;.

==Reign==
Little is known about the details of his reign. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records several natural disasters, including earthquake, drought, and typhoon, thought to indicate ill omen for the kingdom.

He began to invade outskirts of the rival Korean kingdom Silla in 85, but signed a peace treaty in 105. Baekje and Silla were at peace thereafter. In 125, Giru sent help to Silla at Jima&#x27;s request, to repel a Malgal invasion. As there was no enemy to the east side of Baekje, he tied with Goguryeo, sending 10,000 troops to Xuantu Commandery in 122.

Samguk sagi:
* 85 AD, spring, first month. Soldiers were dispatched to attack the borders of Silla. Summer, ninth month. A new star was seen in the Purple Forbidden Enclosure.

<text>David Pacifico, known as [[Don (honorific)|Don]] Pacifico (1784? – 12 April 1854), was a Portuguese Jewish merchant and diplomat. He was considered a British subject by birth and was the central figure in the Anglo–Greek dispute of 1850 known as the Don Pacifico Affair.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Pacifico was a Sephardic Jew of Italian descent. Pacifico&#x27;s grandfather, of the same name, was born in Italy eventually settled down in Gibraltar. His family had been expelled from Spain with the rest of the Jews in 1492. His ancestors reached Italy, particularly Tuscany, first Leghorn and then Florence. As Pacifico grew up in Portugal because of his father&#x27;s work, he was speaking fluent Portuguese. That led to the myth of Portuguese descent for the Pacificos, who were actually of Spanish descent.

Pacifico&#x27;s parents were married in Bevis Marks Synagogue in London in 1761. He gave varying accounts of his birth, placing it either in Oran, which belonged to Spain at the time, or in Gibraltar, which was a British possession. He once claimed to be a Spanish subject.

A liberal living in Portugal during the Civil War of 1828–34, he was persecuted by the Miguelists. In 1835, after the war, he was rewarded by the victorious liberals with a consulship in Morocco and Portuguese citizenship. From 1837 to 1842, he served as consul-general in Athens, during which time he also engaged in commerce and became prominent in the local Jewish community.

===Greece===

Pacifico continued residing in Greece after he was stripped of his position for repeatedly overstepping his authority in 1842. In April 1847, in order not to offend a visiting French Jewish financier, a member of the Rothschild family, the government banned the traditional burning of Judas Iscariot in effigy during Greek Orthodox Easter celebrations. An angry mob sacked Pacifico&#x27;s house as police looked on. Pacifico then enlisted the aid of the British legation in claiming £32,000 in compensation from the Greek government for damage to his property, plus 10% interest and £500 for physical violence against Pacifico himself. The claim was approved by Lord Palmerston, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He also claimed compensation for land of his that had been acquired by the state. While this latter claim was accepted, the Greek government ignored his claims relating to the riot. The affair came to a head in January 1850, when the Royal Navy blockaded Athens to force Greece to settle Pacifico&#x27;s claims and others&#x27;. Through French and Russian intervention, his claims were reduced, the blockade lifted and Greece agreed to pay.

===London===
The Don Pacifico affair provoked a debate in Parliament. Palmerston justified his actions in a speech to the house on 25 June 1850, using the phrase, &quot;Civis romanus sum&quot;, translated as &quot;I am a Roman citizen&quot;, the declaration by a Roman to protect him from harm anywhere in the Roman Empire. He railed against the anti-Semitic prejudice that &quot;because a man is of the Jewish persuasion, he is fair game for any outrage.&quot; In a vote on an opposition motion, the right of a British subject to appeal for aid anywhere in the world was affirmed by the house with a majority of forty-six.

Despite his international prominence, Pacifico was unpopular with London&#x27;s Jews. He died at 15 Bury Street in London on 12 April 1854 and was buried two days later at the Spanish and Portuguese Jews&#x27; cemetery at Mile End Road. In an obituary published 21 April, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; called him an &quot;individual who … caused so much sensation in the political world.&quot;

<doc id="593083" wikidata="Q229646" url="?curid=593083" title="G. E. M. Anscombe">
<text>Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe (; 18 March 1919 – 5 January 2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe or Elizabeth Anscombe, was a British analytic philosopher. She wrote on the philosophy of mind, philosophy of action, philosophical logic, philosophy of language, and ethics. She was a prominent figure of analytical Thomism, a fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, and a professor of philosophy at the University of Cambridge.

Anscombe was a student of Ludwig Wittgenstein and became an authority on his work and edited and translated many books drawn from his writings, above all his &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;. Anscombe&#x27;s 1958 article &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot; introduced the term &quot;consequentialism&quot; into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary virtue ethics. Her monograph &quot;Intention&quot; (1957) was described by Donald Davidson as &quot;the most important treatment of action since Aristotle&quot;. It is &quot;widely considered a foundational text in contemporary philosophy of action&quot; and has also had influence in the philosophy of practical reason.&quot;

== Life ==
Anscombe was born to Gertrude Elizabeth (née Thomas) and Captain Allen Wells Anscombe, on 18 March 1919, in Limerick, Ireland, where her father had been stationed with the Royal Welch Fusiliers during the Irish War of Independence. Both her mother and father were involved with education. Her mother was a headmistress and her father went on to head the science and engineering side at
Dulwich College.

Anscombe attended Sydenham High School and then, in 1937, went on to read &quot;literae humaniores&quot; (&#x27;Greats&#x27;) at St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. She was awarded a second class in her honour moderations in 1939 and (albeit it with reservations on the part of her Ancient History examiners) a first in her degree finals in 1941.

While still at Sydenham High School, Anscombe converted to Catholicism. During her first year at St Hugh&#x27;s, she was received into the Church, and was a practising Catholic thereafter.

In 1941 she married Peter Geach. Like her, Geach was a Catholic convert who became a student of Wittgenstein and a distinguished academic philosopher. Together they had three sons and four daughters.

After graduating from Oxford, Anscombe was awarded a research fellowship for postgraduate study at Newnham College, Cambridge, from 1942 to 1945. Her purpose was to attend Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s lectures. Her interest in Wittgenstein&#x27;s philosophy arose from reading the &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; as an undergraduate. She claimed to have conceived the idea of studying with Wittgenstein as soon as she opened the book in Blackwell&#x27;s and read section 5.53, &quot;Identity of object I express by identity of sign, and not by using a sign for identity. Difference of objects I express by difference of signs.&quot; She became an enthusiastic student, feeling that Wittgenstein&#x27;s therapeutic method helped to free her from philosophical difficulties in ways that her training in traditional systematic philosophy could not. As she wrote:

After her fellowship at Cambridge ended, she was awarded a research fellowship at Somerville College, Oxford, but during the academic year of 1946/47, she continued to travel to Cambridge once a week to attend tutorials with Wittgenstein that were devoted mainly to the philosophy of religion. She became one of Wittgenstein&#x27;s favourite students and one of his closest friends. Wittgenstein affectionately addressed her by the pet name &quot;old man&quot; – she being (according to Ray Monk) &quot;an exception to his general dislike of academic women&quot;. His confidence in Anscombe&#x27;s understanding of his perspective is shown by his choice of her as the translator of his &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; (for which purpose he arranged for her to spend some time in Vienna to improve her German).

Wittgenstein appointed Anscombe as one of his three literary executors and so she played a major role in translating and spreading his works.

Anscombe visited Wittgenstein many times after he left Cambridge in 1947, and Wittgenstein stayed at her house in Oxford for a period in 1950. She travelled to Cambridge in April 1951 to visit him on his deathbed. Wittgenstein named her, along with Rush Rhees and Georg Henrik von Wright, as his literary executor. After his death in 1951 she was responsible for editing, translating, and publishing many of Wittgenstein&#x27;s manuscripts and notebooks.

Anscombe did not avoid controversy. As an undergraduate in 1939 she had publicly criticised Britain&#x27;s entry into the Second World War. And, in 1956, while a research fellow, she unsuccessfully protested against Oxford granting an honorary degree to Harry S. Truman, whom she denounced as a mass murderer for his use of atomic bombs against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. She would further publicise her position in a (sometimes erroneously dated) pamphlet privately printed soon after Truman&#x27;s nomination for the degree was approved. In the same she said she &quot;should fear to go&quot; to the Encaenia (the degree conferral ceremony) &quot;in case God&#x27;s patience suddenly ends.&quot; She would also court controversy with some of her colleagues by defending the Catholic Church&#x27;s opposition to contraception. Later in life, she would be arrested protesting outside an abortion clinic, after abortion had been legalised in Great Britain.

Having remained at Somerville College since 1946, Anscombe was elected Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge in 1970, where she served until her retirement in 1986. She was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1967, and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979.

In her later years, Anscombe suffered from heart disease, and was nearly killed in a car crash in 1996. She never fully recovered and she spent her last years in the care of her family in Cambridge. On 5 January 2001, she died from kidney failure at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital at the age of 81, with her husband and four of their seven children at her bedside, just after praying the Sorrowful Mysteries of the rosary. Anscombe&#x27;s &quot;last intentional act was kissing Peter Geach&quot;, her husband of sixty years.

Anscombe was buried adjacent to Wittgenstein in the St Giles&#x27; graveyard, Huntingdon Road, (now the Ascension Parish burial ground). Her husband joined her there in 2013.

=== Debate with C. S. Lewis ===
As a young philosophy don, Anscombe acquired a reputation as a formidable debater. In 1948, she presented a paper at a meeting of Oxford&#x27;s Socratic Club in which she disputed C. S. Lewis&#x27;s argument that naturalism was self-refuting (found in the third chapter of the original publication of his book &quot;Miracles&quot;). Some associates of Lewis, primarily George Sayer and Derek Brewer, have remarked that Lewis lost the subsequent debate on her paper and that this loss was so humiliating that he abandoned theological argument and turned entirely to devotional writing and children&#x27;s literature. This is a claim disputed by Walter Hooper and Anscombe&#x27;s impression of the effect upon Lewis differed:

As a result of the debate, Lewis substantially rewrote chapter 3 of &quot;Miracles&quot; for the 1960 paperback edition.

== Work ==

=== On Wittgenstein ===
Some of Anscombe&#x27;s most frequently cited works are translations, editions, and expositions of the work of her teacher Ludwig Wittgenstein, including an influential exegesis of Wittgenstein&#x27;s 1921 book, the &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;. This brought to the fore the importance of Gottlob Frege for Wittgenstein&#x27;s thought and, partly on that basis, attacked &quot;positivist&quot; interpretations of the work. She co-edited his posthumous second book, &quot;Philosophische Untersuchungen/Philosophical Investigations&quot; (1953) with Rush Rhees. Her English translation of the book appeared simultaneously and remains standard. She went on to edit or co-edit several volumes of selections from his notebooks, (co-)translating many important works like &quot;Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics&quot; (1956) and Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;sustained treatment&quot; of G. E. Moore&#x27;s epistemology, &quot;On Certainty&quot; (1969).

In 1978, Anscombe was awarded the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class for her work on Wittgenstein.

=== &quot;Intention&quot; ===
Her most important work is the monograph &quot;Intention&quot; (1957). Three volumes of collected papers were published in 1981: &quot;From Parmenides to Wittgenstein&quot;; &quot;Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Mind&quot;; and &quot;Ethics, Religion and Politics&quot;. Another collection, &quot;Human Life, Action and Ethics&quot; appeared posthumously in 2005.

The aim of &quot;Intention&quot; (1957) was to make plain the character of human action and will. Anscombe approaches the matter through the concept of intention, which, as she notes, has three modes of appearance in the English language:

She suggests that a true account must somehow connect these three uses of the concept, though later students of intention have sometimes denied this, and disputed some of the things she presupposes under the first and third headings. It is clear though that it is the second that is crucial to her main purpose, which is to comprehend the way in which human thought and understanding and conceptualisation relate to the &quot;events in a man&#x27;s history&quot;, or the goings on to which he is subject.

Rather than attempt to define intentions in abstraction from actions, thus taking the third heading first, Anscombe begins with the concept of an intentional action. This soon connected with the second heading. She says that what is up with a human being is an intentional action if the question &quot;Why&quot;, taken in a certain sense (and evidently conceived as addressed to him), has application. An agent can answer the &quot;why&quot; question by giving a reason or purpose for her action. &quot;To do Y&quot; or &quot;because I want to do Y&quot; would be typical answers to this sort of &quot;why?&quot;; though they are not the only ones, they are crucial to the constitution of the phenomenon as a typical phenomenon of human life. The agent&#x27;s answer helps supply the descriptions under which the action is intentional. Anscombe was the first to clearly spell out that actions are intentional under some descriptions and not others. In her famous example, a man&#x27;s action (which we might observe as consisting of moving an arm up and down while holding a handle) may be intentional under the description &quot;pumping water&quot; but not under other descriptions such as &quot;contracting these muscles&quot;, &quot;tapping out this rhythm&quot;, and so on. This approach to action influenced Donald Davidson&#x27;s theory, despite the fact that Davidson went on to argue for a causal theory of action that Anscombe never accepted.

&quot;Intention&quot; (1957) is also the classic source for the idea that there is a difference in &quot;direction of fit&quot; between cognitive states like beliefs and conative states like desire. (This theme was later taken up and discussed by John Searle.) Cognitive states describe the world and are causally derived from the facts or objects they depict. Conative states do not describe the world, but aim to bring something about in the world. Anscombe used the example of a shopping list to illustrate the difference. The list can be a straightforward observational report of what is actually bought (thereby acting like a cognitive state), or it can function as a conative state such as a command or desire, dictating what the agent should buy. If the agent fails to buy what is listed, we do not say that the list is untrue or incorrect; we say that the mistake is in the action, not the desire. According to Anscombe, this difference in direction of fit is a major difference between speculative knowledge (theoretical, empirical knowledge) and practical knowledge (knowledge of actions and morals). Whereas &quot;speculative knowledge&quot; is &quot;derived from the objects known&quot;, practical knowledge is – in a phrase Anscombe lifts from Aquinas – &quot;the cause of what it understands&quot;.

=== Ethics ===

Anscombe made great contributions to ethics as well as metaphysics. Her 1958 essay &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot; is credited with having coined the term &quot;consequentialism&quot;, as well as with reviving interest in and study of virtue ethics in Western academic philosophy.

The Anscombe Bioethics Centre in Oxford is named after her, and conducts bioethical research in the Catholic tradition.

=== Brute and institutional facts ===
Anscombe also introduced the idea of a set of facts being &#x27;brute relative to&#x27; some fact. When a set of facts xyz stands in this relation to a fact A, they are a subset out of a range some subset among which holds if A holds. Thus if A is the fact that I have paid for something, the brute facts might be that I have handed him a cheque for a sum which he has named as the price for the goods, saying that this is the payment, or that I gave him some cash at the time that he gave me the goods. There tends, according to Anscombe, to be an institutional context which gives its point to the description &#x27;A&#x27;, but of which &#x27;A&#x27; is not itself a description: that I have given someone a shilling is not a description of the institution of money or of the currency of the country. According to her, no brute facts &quot;xyz&quot; can generally be said to entail the fact &quot;A&quot; relative to which they are &#x27;brute&#x27; except with the proviso &quot;under normal circumstances&quot;, for &quot;one cannot mention all the things that were not the case, which would have made a difference if they had been.&quot; A set of facts xyz ... may be brute relative to a fact A which itself is one of a set of facts ABC ... which is brute relative to some further fact W. Thus Anscombe&#x27;s account is not of a distinct class of facts, to be distinguished from another class, &#x27;institutional facts&#x27;: the essential relation is that of a set of facts being &#x27;brute relative to&#x27; some fact. Following Anscombe, John Searle derived another conception of &#x27;brute facts&#x27; as non-mental facts to play the foundational role and generate similar hierarchies in his philosophical account of speech acts and institutional reality.

=== First person ===
Her paper &quot;The First Person&quot; buttressed remarks by Wittgenstein (in his Lectures on &quot;Private Experience&quot;) arguing for the now-notorious conclusion that the first-person pronoun, &quot;I&quot;, does not refer to anything (not, e.g., to the speaker) because of its immunity from reference failure. Having shown by counter-example that &#x27;I&#x27; does not refer to the body, Anscombe objected to the implied Cartesianism of its referring at all. Few people accept the conclusion – though the position was later adopted in a more radical form by David Lewis – but the paper was an important contribution to work on indexicals and self-consciousness that has been carried on by philosophers as varied as John Perry, Peter Strawson, David Kaplan, Gareth Evans, John McDowell, and Sebastian Rödl.

=== Causality ===
In her article, &quot;Causality and Determination&quot;, Anscombe defends two main ideas: that causal relations are perceivable, and that causation does not require a necessary connection and a universal generalization linking cause and effect. Regarding her idea that causal relations are perceivable, she believes that we perceive the causal relations between objects and events.

In defending her idea that causal relations are perceivable, Anscombe poses a question &quot;How did we come by our primary knowledge of causality?&quot;. She proposes two answers to this question:

# By &quot;learning to speak, we learned the linguistic representation and application of a host of causal concepts&quot;
# By observing that some action(s) caused a certain event

In proposing her first answer, that by &quot;learning to speak, we learned the linguistic representation and application of a host of causal concepts&quot;, Anscombe thinks that by learning to speak we already have a linguistic representation of certain causal concepts and she gives an example of transitive verbs, such as scrape, push, carry, knock over.Example: I knocked over a vase of flowers.In proposing her second answer, that by observing some actions we can see causation, Anscombe thinks that we cannot ignore the fact that certain actions, which produced a certain event are possible to observe.Example: a cat spilled milk.The second idea that Anscombe defends in the article &quot;Causality and Determination&quot; is that causation requires neither a necessary connection nor a universal generalization linking cause and effect.

Anscombe states that it is assumed that causality is some kind of necessary connection.

== Views of her work ==
The philosopher Candace Vogler says that Anscombe&#x27;s &quot;strength&quot; is that when she is writing for [a] Catholic audience, she presumes they share certain fundamental beliefs,&#x27; but she is equally willing to write for people who do not share her assumptions.&quot; In 2010, philosopher Roger Scruton wrote that Anscombe was &quot;perhaps the last great philosopher writing in English&quot;. Mary Warnock described her as &quot;the undoubted giant among women philosophers&quot; while John Haldane said she &quot;certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know&quot;.

<text>Gaeru (died 166, r. 128–166) was the fourth king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

==Background==
According to the history compilation &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, he was the son of the previous king Giru. He became king upon Giru&#x27;s death in 128 which was the 52nd year of his reign. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records that &quot;his character was respectful and also orderly in his conduct&quot;.

==Reign==
In 132, he founded Bukhansanseong in present-day Goyang, South Korea. Baekje fought off many Goguryeo (the northern Korean kingdom) invasions from this fortress, and the 5th king Chogo based his northward campaign on it. Baekje&#x27;s relationship with the southeastern rival Silla was peaceful for most of his period of reign. However, in 145, a Silla minister named Gilseon () failed his coup d&#x27;etat attempt and fled to Baekje. Gaeru gave him refuge despite the Silla king Adalla&#x27;s written request for his return. Silla subsequently attacked Baekje, and a broad war over the Sobaek Mountains ensued.

Samguk sagi:
* 131 AD, summer, fourth month. The king went hunting at Mt. Han.
* 132 AD, spring, second month. The fortress of Mt. Bukhan (Bukhansanseong) was constructed.
* 137 AD, autumn, eighth month. Mars moved into the Southern Dipper.
* 145 AD, spring, first month, last day of the month. There was a solar eclipse. Winter, tenth month. Ajan Gilseon of Silla made a treasonous plot but it was discovered and he came to our country. The king of Silla sent a written request for him but he was not sent back. The king of Silla was furious and led soldiers out and came to attack. All the fortresses were fortified and defended themselves, and he could not get in. The Sillan soldiers used all their stores and returned.

During the Spring and Autumn period, when Pu of Chu fled to Lu, Ji Wenzi said, &quot;Seeing one who conducts himself properly toward his lord is like seeing a child who is filial to its father and mother. Upon seeing one who is not proper to his lord, he should be killed like a hawk on a sparrow. Seeing Pu of Chu, [he said that] he has no measure of virtue and had murderous ethics, and this passed. Now Gilseon was also a wicked and rebellious man, and the king of Baekje took him in and hid him. Thus we can say that concealing a villain makes one a harborer. Therefore, the peace was lost with neighboring countries, and the king made his people suffer under the burden of attack. This lacked insight.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; states that Gaeru&#x27;s eldest son became the 5th king Chogo and the second son became the 8th king Goi. This chronological inconsistency is thought to indicate a power struggle between two royal lines. The 21st king Gaero (also known as Geungaeru) apparently took Gaeru&#x27;s name to assert the legitimacy of this.

==Family==
* Father: Giru of Baekje
* Mother: unknown
** Brother: Buyeo Jil (扶餘質, ?–?) – in April, 242 he was appointed as the official &quot;Woo-bo&quot; (右輔), prime minister.
** Queen(s): unknown
*** 1st son: 5th King, Chogo of Baekje (肖古王, ?–214) – before he became king he was known as Buyeo Chogo (扶餘肖古).
*** 2nd son: 8th King, Goi of Baekje (古爾王, ?–286) – before he became king he was known as Buyeo Goi (扶餘古爾).
*** 3rd son: Buyeo Usu (扶餘優壽, ?–?) – the only record of him is in the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; in 260 when he was appointed Minister of the Interior (內臣佐平, &quot;Naesin-jwa&#x27;pyeong&quot;).

<doc id="593095" wikidata="Q661384" url="?curid=593095" title="Panpsychism">
<text>In the philosophy of mind, panpsychism () is the view that the mind or a mind-like aspect is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality. It is also described as a theory that &quot;the mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe&quot;. It is one of the oldest philosophical theories, and has been ascribed in some form to philosophers including Thales, Plato, Spinoza, Leibniz, Schopenhauer, William James, Alfred North Whitehead, and Bertrand Russell. In the 19th century, panpsychism was the default philosophy of mind in Western thought, but it saw a decline in the mid-20th century with the rise of logical positivism. Recent interest in the hard problem of consciousness and developments in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, and quantum mechanics have revived interest in panpsychism in the 21st century because it addresses the hard problem directly.

== Overview ==
=== Etymology ===
The term &quot;panpsychism&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;pan&quot; (: &quot;all, everything, whole&quot;) and &quot;psyche&quot; (: &quot;soul, mind&quot;). The use of &quot;psyche&quot; is controversial because it is synonymous with &quot;soul&quot;, a term usually taken to refer to something supernatural; more common terms now found in the literature include mind, mental properties, mental aspect, and experience.

=== Concept ===
Panpsychism holds that mind or a mind-like aspect is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality. It is sometimes defined as a theory in which &quot;the mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe&quot;. Panpsychists posit that the type of mentality we know through our own experience is present, in some form, in a wide range of natural bodies. This notion has taken on a wide variety of forms. Some historical and non-Western panpsychists ascribe attributes such as life or spirits to all entities (animism). Contemporary academic proponents, however, hold that sentience or subjective experience is ubiquitous, while distinguishing these qualities from more complex human mental attributes. They therefore ascribe a primitive form of mentality to entities at the fundamental level of physics but may not ascribe mentality to most aggregate things, such as rocks or buildings.

=== Terminology ===
The philosopher David Chalmers, who has explored panpsychism as a viable theory, distinguishes between microphenomenal experiences (the experiences of entities) and macrophenomenal experiences (the experiences of larger entities, such as humans).

Philip Goff draws a distinction between &quot;panexperientialism&quot; and &quot;pancognitivism&quot;. In the form of panpsychism under discussion in the contemporary literature, conscious experience is present everywhere at a fundamental level, hence the term &quot;panexperientialism&quot;. Pancognitivism, by contrast, is the view that thought is present everywhere at a fundamental level—a view that had some historical advocates, but no present-day academic adherents. Contemporary panpsychists do not believe microphysical entities have complex mental states such as beliefs, desires, and fears.

Originally, the term &quot;panexperientialism&quot; had a narrower meaning, having been coined by David Ray Griffin to refer specifically to the form of panpsychism used in process philosophy (see below).

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===
Panpsychist views are a staple in pre-Socratic Greek philosophy. According to Aristotle, Thales (c. 624 – 545 BCE), the first Greek philosopher, posited a theory which held &quot;that everything is full of gods&quot;. Thales believed that magnets demonstrated this. This has been interpreted as a panpsychist doctrine. Other Greek thinkers associated with panpsychism include Anaxagoras (who saw the unifying principle or &quot;arche&quot; as &quot;nous&quot; or mind), Anaximenes (who saw the &quot;arche&quot; as &quot;pneuma&quot; or spirit) and Heraclitus (who said &quot;The thinking faculty is common to all&quot;).

Plato argues for panpsychism in his &quot;Sophist&quot;, in which he writes that all things participate in the form of Being and that it must have a psychic aspect of mind and soul (&quot;psyche&quot;). In the &quot;Philebus&quot; and &quot;Timaeus&quot;, Plato argues for the idea of a world soul or &quot;anima mundi&quot;. According to Plato:
 This world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.

Stoicism developed a cosmology that held that the natural world is infused with the divine fiery essence &quot;pneuma&quot;, directed by the universal intelligence &quot;logos&quot;. The relationship between beings&#x27; individual &quot;logos&quot; and the universal &quot;logos&quot; was a central concern of the Roman Stoic Marcus Aurelius. The metaphysics of Stoicism finds connections with Hellenistic philosophies such as Neoplatonism. Gnosticism also made use of the Platonic idea of &quot;anima mundi&quot;.

=== Renaissance ===
After Emperor Justinian closed Plato&#x27;s Academy in 529 CE, neoplatonism declined. Though there were mediaeval theologians, such as John Scotus Eriugena, who ventured into what might be called panpsychism, it was not a dominant strain in philosophical theology. But in the Italian Renaissance, it enjoyed something of a revival in the thought of figures such as Gerolamo Cardano, Bernardino Telesio, Francesco Patrizi, Giordano Bruno, and Tommaso Campanella. Cardano argued for the view that soul or &quot;anima&quot; was a fundamental part of the world, and Patrizi introduced the term &quot;panpsychism&quot; into philosophical vocabulary. According to Bruno, &quot;There is nothing that does not possess a soul and that has no vital principle&quot;. Platonist ideas resembling the &quot;anima mundi&quot; (world soul) also resurfaced in the work of esoteric thinkers such as Paracelsus, Robert Fludd, and Cornelius Agrippa.

=== Early modern ===
In the 17th century, two rationalists, Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, can be said to be panpsychists. In Spinoza&#x27;s monism, the one single infinite and eternal substance is &quot;God, or Nature&quot; (&quot;Deus sive Natura&quot;), which has the aspects of mind (thought) and matter (extension). Leibniz&#x27;s view is that there are infinitely many absolutely simple mental substances called monads that make up the universe&#x27;s fundamental structure. While it has been said that George Berkeley&#x27;s idealist philosophy is also a form of panpsychism, Berkeley rejected panpsychism and posited that the physical world exists only in the experiences minds have of it, while restricting minds to humans and certain other specific agents.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, panpsychism was at its zenith. Philosophers such as Arthur Schopenhauer, C.S. Peirce, Josiah Royce, William James, Eduard von Hartmann, F.C.S. Schiller, Ernst Haeckel, William Kingdon Clifford and Thomas Carlyle as well as psychologists such as Gustav Fechner, Wilhelm Wundt, Rudolf Hermann Lotze all promoted panpsychist ideas.

Arthur Schopenhauer argued for a two-sided view of reality as both Will and Representation (&quot;Vorstellung&quot;). According to Schopenhauer, &quot;All ostensible mind can be attributed to matter, but all matter can likewise be attributed to mind&quot;.

Josiah Royce, the leading American absolute idealist, held that reality is a &quot;world self&quot;, a conscious being that comprises everything, though he didn&#x27;t necessarily attribute mental properties to the smallest constituents of mentalistic &quot;systems&quot;. The American pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce espoused a sort of psycho-physical monism in which the universe is suffused with mind, which he associated with spontaneity and freedom. Following Pierce, William James also espoused a form of panpsychism. In his lecture notes, James wrote: 
Our only intelligible notion of an object &quot;in itself&quot; is that it should be an object &quot;for itself&quot;, and this lands us in panpsychism and a belief that our physical perceptions are effects on us of &#x27;psychical&#x27; realities

English philosopher Alfred Barratt, the author of &quot;Physical Metempiric&quot; (1883), has been described as advocating panpsychism.

In 1893, Paul Carus proposed a philosophy similar to panpsychism, &quot;panbiotism&quot;, according to which &quot;everything is fraught with life; it contains life; it has the ability to live&quot;.

=== 20th century ===
Bertrand Russell&#x27;s neutral monist views tended toward panpsychism. The physicist Arthur Eddington also defended a form of panpsychism. The psychologists Gerard Heymans, James Ward and Charles Augustus Strong also endorsed variants of panpsychism.

In 1990, the physicist David Bohm published &quot;A new theory of the relationship of mind and matter,&quot; a paper based on his interpretation of quantum mechanics. The philosopher Paavo Pylkkänen has described Bohm&#x27;s view as a version of panprotopsychism.

One widespread misconception is that the arguably greatest systematic metaphysician of the 20th century, Alfred North Whitehead, was also panpsychism&#x27;s most significant 20th century proponent. This misreading attributes to Whitehead an ontology according to which the basic nature of the world is made up of atomic mental events, termed &quot;actual occasions&quot;. But rather than signifying such exotic metaphysical objects—which would in fact exemplify the fallacy of misplaced concreteness Whitehead criticizes—Whitehead&#x27;s concept of &quot;actual occasion&quot; refers to the &quot;immediate experienced occasion&quot; of any possible perceiver, having in mind only himself as perceiver at the outset, in accordance with his strong commitment to radical empiricism.

=== Contemporary ===
Panpsychism has recently seen a resurgence in the philosophy of mind, set into motion by Thomas Nagel&#x27;s 1979 article &quot;Panpsychism&quot; and further spurred by Galen Strawson&#x27;s 2006 realistic monist article &quot;Realistic Monism: Why Physicalism Entails Panpsychism&quot;. Other recent proponents include American philosophers David Ray Griffin and David Skrbina, British philosophers Gregg Rosenberg, Timothy Sprigge, and Philip Goff, and Canadian philosopher William Seager. The British philosopher David Papineau, while distancing himself from orthodox panpsychists, has written that his view is &quot;not unlike panpsychism&quot; in that he rejects a line in nature between &quot;events lit up by phenomenology [and] those that are mere darkness&quot;.

The integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT), proposed by the neuroscientist and psychiatrist Giulio Tononi in 2004 and since adopted by other neuroscientists such as Christof Koch, postulates that consciousness is widespread and can be found even in some simple systems.

In 2019, cognitive scientist Donald Hoffman published &quot;The Case Against Reality: How evolution hid the truth from our eyes.&quot; Hoffman argues that consensus reality lacks concrete existence, and is nothing more than an evolved user-interface. He argues that the true nature of reality is abstract &quot;conscious agents&quot;. Science editor Annaka Harris argues that panpsychism is a viable theory in her 2019 book &quot;Conscious&quot;, though she stops short of fully endorsing it.

Panpsychism has been postulated by psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown as a means to theorizing relations between &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; tropes in the context of psychotherapy. Panpsychism has also been applied in environmental philosophy by Australian philosopher Freya Mathews, who has put forward the notion of ontopoetics as a version of panpsychism.

The geneticist Sewall Wright endorsed a version of panpsychism. He believed that consciousness is not a mysterious property emerging at a certain level of the hierarchy of increasing material complexity, but rather an inherent property, implying the most elementary particles have these properties.

== Varieties ==
Panpsychism encompasses many theories, united only by the notion that mind in some form is ubiquitous.

=== Philosophical frameworks ===
==== Cosmopsychism ====
Cosmopsychism hypothesizes that the cosmos is a unified object that is ontologically prior to its parts. It has been described as an alternative to panpsychism, or as a form of panpsychism. Proponents of cosmopsychism claim that the cosmos as a whole is the fundamental level of reality and that it instantiates consciousness. They differ on that point from panpsychists, who usually claim that the smallest level of reality is fundamental and instantiates consciousness. Accordingly, human consciousness, for example, merely derives from a larger cosmic consciousness.

==== Panexperientialism ====
Panexperientialism is associated with the philosophies of, among others, Charles Hartshorne and Alfred North Whitehead, although the term itself was invented by David Ray Griffin to distinguish the process philosophical view from other varieties of panpsychism. Whitehead&#x27;s process philosophy argues that the fundamental elements of the universe are &quot;occasions of experience&quot;, which can together create something as complex as a human being. Building on Whitehead&#x27;s work, process philosopher Michel Weber argues for a pancreativism. Goff has used the term &quot;panexperientialism&quot; more generally to refer to forms of panpsychism in which experience rather than thought is ubiquitous.

==== Panprotopsychism ====
Panprotopsychists believe that higher-order phenomenal properties (such as qualia) are logically entailed by protophenomenal properties, at least in principle. This is similar to how facts about H2O molecules logically entail facts about water: the lower-level facts are sufficient to explain the higher-order facts, since the former logically entail the latter. It also makes sense of questions about the unity of consciousness relating to the diversity of phenomenal experiences and the deflation of the self. Adherents of panprotopsychism believe that &quot;protophenomenal&quot; facts logically entail consciousness. Protophenomenal properties are usually picked out through a combination of functional and negative definitions: panphenomenal properties are those that logically entail phenomenal properties (a functional definition), which are themselves neither physical nor phenomenal (a negative definition).

Panprotopsychism is advertised as a solution to the combination problem: the problem of explaining how the consciousness of microscopic physical things might combine to give rise to the macroscopic consciousness of the whole brain. Because protophenomenal properties are by definition the constituent parts of consciousness, it is speculated that their existence would make the emergence of macroscopic minds less mysterious. The philosopher David Chalmers argues that the view faces difficulty with the combination problem. He considers it &quot;ad hoc&quot;, and believes it diminishes the parsimony that made the theory initially interesting.

==== Russellian monism ====


Russellian monism is a type of neutral monism. The theory is attributed to Bertrand Russell, and may also be called &quot;Russell&#x27;s panpsychism,&quot; or &quot;Russell&#x27;s neutral monism&quot;. Russell believed that all causal properties are extrinsic manifestations of identical intrinsic properties. Russell called these identical internal properties &quot;quiddities&quot;. Just as the extrinsic properties of matter can form higher-order structure, so can their corresponding and identical quiddities. Russell believed the conscious mind was one such structure.

=== Religious or mystical ontologies ===
==== Advaita Vedānta ====
Advaita Vedānta is a form of idealism in Indian philosophy which views consensus reality as illusory. Anand Vaidya and Purushottama Bilimoria have argued that it can be considered a form of panpsychism or cosmopsychism.

==== Animism and hylozoism ====
Animism maintains that all things have a soul, and hylozoism maintains that all things are alive. Both could reasonably be interpreted as panpsychist, but both have fallen out of favour in contemporary academia. Modern panpsychists have tried to distance themselves from theories of this sort, careful to carve out the distinction between the ubiquity of experience and the ubiquity of mind and cognition.

====Panpsychism and metempsychosis====

Between 1840 and 1864, the Austrian mystic Jakob Lorber claimed to have received a 26-volume revelation. Various books of the Lorber Revelations say that specifica, closely resembling Leibniz&#x27;s monads, form the most basic, irreducible substance of all physical and metaphysical creation. According to the Lorber Revelations, specifica grow in complexity and intelligence to form ever higher level clusters of intelligence until a fully intelligent human soul is reached. In this scenario panpsychism and metempsychosis are used to overcome the combination problem.

==== Buddha-nature ====


Buddha-nature is an important and multifaceted doctrine in Mahayana Buddhism that is related to the capacity to attain Buddhahood. In numerous Indian sources, the idea is connected to the mind, especially the Buddhist concept of the luminous mind. In some Buddhist traditions, the Buddha-nature doctrine may be interpreted as implying a form of panpsychism. Graham Parks argues that most &quot;traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean philosophy would qualify as panpsychist in nature&quot;.

The Huayan, Tiantai, and Tendai schools of Buddhism explicitly attribute Buddha-nature to inanimate objects such as lotus flowers and mountains. This idea was defended by figures such as the Tiantai patriarch Zhanran, who spoke of the Buddha-nature of grasses and trees. Similarly, Soto Zen master Dogen argued that &quot;insentient beings expound&quot; the teachings of the Buddha, and wrote about the &quot;mind&quot; (心, &quot;shin&quot;) of &quot;fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles&quot;. The 9th-century Shingon figure Kukai went so far as to argue that natural objects such as rocks and stones are part of the supreme embodiment of the Buddha. According to Parks, Buddha-nature is best described &quot;in western terms&quot; as something &quot;&quot;psychophysical&quot;.&quot;

=== Scientific theories ===
==== Conscious realism ====


Conscious realism is a theory proposed by Donald Hoffman, a cognitive scientist specialising in perception. He has written numerous papers on the topic which he summarised in his 2019 book &quot;The Case Against Reality: How evolution hid the truth from our eyes.&quot; Conscious realism builds upon Hoffman&#x27;s former &quot;User-Interface Theory&quot;. In combination they argue that (1) consensus reality and spacetime are illusory, and are merely a &quot;species specific evolved user interface&quot;; (2) Reality is made of a complex, dimensionless, and timeless network of &quot;conscious agents&quot;.

The consensus view is that perception is a reconstruction of one&#x27;s environment. Hoffman views perception as a construction rather than a reconstruction. He argues that perceptual systems are analogous to information channels, and thus subject to data compression and reconstruction. The set of possible reconstructions for any given data set is quite large. Of that set, the subset that is homomorphic in relation to the original is minuscule, and does not necessarily—or, seemingly, even often—overlap with the subset that is efficient or easiest to use.

For example, consider a graph, such as a pie chart. A pie chart is easy to understand and use not because it is perfectly homomorphic with the data it represents, but because it isn&#x27;t. If a graph of, for example, the chemical composition of the human body were to look exactly like a human body, then we could not understand it. It is only because the graph abstracts away from the structure of its subject matter that it can be visualized. Alternatively, consider a graphical user interface on a computer. The reason graphical user interfaces are useful is that they abstract away from lower-level computational processes, such as machine code, or the physical state of a circuit-board. In general, it seems that data is most useful to us when it is abstracted from its original structure and repackaged in a way that is easier to understand, even if this comes at the cost of accuracy. Hoffman offers the &quot;fitness beats truth theorem&quot; as mathematical proof that perceptions of reality bear little resemblance to reality&#x27;s true nature. From this he concludes that our senses do not faithfully represent the external world.

Even if reality is an illusion, Hoffman takes consciousness as an indisputable fact. He represents rudimentary units of consciousness (which he calls &quot;conscious agents&quot;) as Markovian kernels. Though the theory was not initially panpsychist, he reports that he and his colleague Chetan Prakash found the math to be more parsimonious if it were. They hypothesize that reality is composed of these conscious agents, who interact to form &quot;larger, more complex&quot; networks.

==== Integrated information theory ====
Giulio Tononi first articulated Integrated information theory (IIT) in 2004, and it has undergone two major revisions since then. Tononi approaches consciousness from a scientific perspective, and has expressed frustration with philosophical theories of consciousness for lacking predictive power. Though integral to his theory, he refrains from philosophical terminology such as &quot;qualia&quot; or the &quot;unity of consciousness,&quot; instead opting for mathematically precise alternatives like &quot;entropy function&quot; and &quot;information integration&quot;. This has allowed Tononi to create a measurement for integrated information, which he calls &quot;phi&quot; (Φ). He believes consciousness is nothing but integrated information, so Φ measures consciousness. As it turns out, even basic objects or substances have a nonzero degree of Φ. This would mean that consciousness is ubiquitous, albeit to a minimal degree.

The philosopher Hedda Hassel Mørch&#x27;s views IIT as similar to Russellian monism, while other philosophers, such as Chalmers and John Searle, consider it a form of panpsychism. IIT does not hold that all systems are conscious, leading Tononi and Koch to state that IIT incorporates some elements of panpsychism but not others. Koch has called IIT a &quot;scientifically refined version&quot; of panpsychism.

==In relation to other theories==
Because panpsychism encompasses a wide range of theories, it can in principle be compatible with reductive materialism, dualism, functionalism, or other perspectives depending on the details of a given formulation.

=== Dualism ===
David Chalmers and Philip Goff have each described panpsychism as an alternative to both materialism and dualism. Chalmers says panpsychism respects the conclusions of both the causal argument against dualism and the conceivability argument for dualism. Goff has argued that panpsychism avoids the disunity of dualism, under which mind and matter are ontologically separate, as well as dualism&#x27;s problems explaining how mind and matter interact. By contrast, Uwe Meixner argues that panpsychism has dualist forms, which he contrasts to idealist forms.

=== Emergentism ===
Panpsychism is incompatible with emergentism. In general, theories of consciousness fall under one or the other umbrella; they hold either that consciousness is present at a fundamental level of reality (panpsychism) or that it emerges higher up (emergentism).

=== Idealism ===
There is disagreement over whether idealism is a form of panpsychism or a separate view. Both views hold that everything that exists has some form of experience. According to the philosophers William Seager and Sean Allen-Hermanson, &quot;idealists are panpsychists by default&quot;. Charles Hartshorne contrasted panpsychism and idealism, saying that while idealists rejected the existence of the world observed with the senses or understood it as ideas within the mind of God, panpsychists accepted the reality of the world but saw it as composed of minds. Chalmers also contrasts panpsychism with idealism (as well as materialism and dualism). Meixner writes that formulations of panpsychism can be divided into dualist and idealist versions. He further divides the latter into &quot;atomistic idealistic panpsychism&quot;, which he ascribes to David Hume, and &quot;holistic idealistic panpsychism&quot;, which he favors.

=== Neutral monism ===
Neutral monism rejects the dichotomy of mind and matter, instead taking a third substance as fundamental that is neither mental nor physical. Proposals for the nature of the third substance have varied, with some theorists choosing to leave it undefined. This has led to a variety of formulations of neutral monism, which may overlap with other philosophies. In versions of neutral monism in which the world&#x27;s fundamental constituents are neither mental nor physical, it is quite distinct from panpsychism. In versions where the fundamental constituents are both mental and physical, neutral monism may lead to panpsychism, panprotopsychism, or dual aspect theory.

In &quot;The Conscious Mind,&quot; David Chalmers writes that, in some instances, the differences between &quot;Russell&#x27;s neutral monism&quot; and his property dualism are merely semantic. Philip Goff believes that neutral monism can reasonably be regarded as a form of panpsychism &quot;in so far as it is a dual aspect view&quot;. Neutral monism, panpsychism, and dual aspect theory are grouped together or used interchangeably in some contexts.

=== Physicalism and materialism ===
Chalmers calls panpsychism an alternative to both materialism and dualism. Similarly, Goff calls panpsychism an alternative to both physicalism and substance dualism. Strawson, on the other hand, describes panpsychism as a form of physicalism, in his view the only viable form. Panpsychism can be combined with reductive materialism but cannot be combined with eliminative materialism because the latter denies the existence of the relevant mental attributes.

== Arguments for ==
=== Hard problem of consciousness ===
It evidently feels like something to be a human brain. This means that when things in the world are organised in a particular way, they begin to have an experience. The questions of &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; this material structure has experience, and why it has &quot;that&quot; particular experience rather than another experience, are known as the &quot;hard problem of consciousness&quot;. The term is attributed to Chalmers. He argues that even after &quot;all the perceptual and cognitive functions within the vicinity of consciousness&quot; are accounted for, &quot;there may still remain a further unanswered question: &quot;Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience?&quot;&quot;

Though Chalmers gave the hard problem of consciousness its present name, similar views were expressed before. Isaac Newton, John Locke, Gottfried Leibniz, John Stuart Mill, Thomas Henry Huxley, Wilhelm Wundt, all wrote about the seeming incompatibility of third-person functional descriptions of mind and matter and first-person conscious experience. Likewise, Asian philosophers like Dharmakirti and Guifeng Zongmi discussed the problem of how consciousness arises from unconscious matter. Similar sentiments have been articulated through philosophical inquiries such as the problem of other minds, solipsism, the explanatory gap, philosophical zombies, and Mary&#x27;s room. These problems have caused Chalmers to consider panpsychism a viable solution to the hard problem, though he is not committed to any single view.

Brian Jonathan Garrett has compared the hard problem to vitalism, the now discredited hypothesis that life is inexplicable and can only be understood if some vital life force exists. He maintains that given time, consciousness and its evolutionary origins will be understood just as life is now understood. Daniel Dennett called the hard problem a &quot;hunch&quot;, and maintained that conscious experience, as it is usually understood, is merely a complex cognitive illusion. Patricia Churchland, also an eliminative materialist, maintains that philosophers ought to be more patient: neuroscience is still in its early stages, so Chalmers&#x27;s hard problem is premature. Clarity will come from learning more about the brain, not from metaphysical speculation.

==== Solutions ====
In &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot; (1996), Chalmers attempts to pinpoint why the hard problem is so hard. He concludes that consciousness is &quot;irreducible&quot; to lower-level physical facts, just as the fundamental laws of physics are irreducible to lower-level physical facts. Therefore, consciousness should be taken as fundamental in its own right and studied as such. Just as fundamental properties of reality are ubiquitous (even small objects have mass), consciousness may also be, though he considers that an open question.

In &quot;Mortal Questions&quot; (1979), Thomas Nagel argues that panpsychism follows from four premises:

* P1: There is no spiritual plane or disembodied soul; everything that exists is material.
* P2: Consciousness is irreducible to lower-level physical properties.
* P3: Consciousness exists.
* P4: Higher-order properties of matter (i.e., emergent properties) can, at least in principle, be reduced to their lower-level properties.

Before the first premise is accepted, the range of possible explanations for consciousness is fully open. Each premise, if accepted, narrows down that range of possibilities. If the argument is sound, then by the last premise panpsychism is the only possibility left.

* If (P1) is true, then either consciousness does not exist, or it exists within the physical world.
* If (P2) is true, then either consciousness does not exist, or it (a) exists as distinct property of matter or (b) is fundamentally entailed by matter.
* If (P3) is true, then consciousness exists, and is either (a) its own property of matter or (b) composed by the matter of the brain but not logically entailed by it.
* If (P4) is true, then (b) is false, and consciousness must be its own unique property of matter.

Therefore, if all four premises are true, consciousness is its own unique property of matter and panpsychism is true.

=== Mind-body problem ===


In 2015, Chalmers proposed a possible solution to the mind-body problem through the argumentative format of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The goal of such arguments is to argue for sides of a debate (the thesis and antithesis), weigh their vices and merits, and then reconcile them (the synthesis). Chalmers&#x27;s thesis, antithesis, and synthesis are as follows:
# &quot;Thesis:&quot; materialism is true; everything is fundamentally physical.
# &quot;Antithesis:&quot; dualism is true; not everything is fundamentally physical.
# &quot;Synthesis:&quot; panpsychism is true.
(1) A centerpiece of Chalmers&#x27;s argument is the physical world&#x27;s causal closure. Newton&#x27;s law of motion explains this phenomenon succinctly: &quot;for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction&quot;. Cause and effect is a symmetrical process. There is no room for consciousness to exert any causal power on the physical world unless it is itself physical.

(2) On one hand, if consciousness is separate from the physical world then there is no room for it to exert any causal power on the world (a state of affairs philosophers call epiphenomenalism). If consciousness plays no causal role, then it is unclear how Chalmers could even write this paper. On the other hand, consciousness is irreducible to the physical processes of the brain.

(3) Panpsychism has all the benefits of materialism because it could mean that consciousness is physical while also escaping the grasp of epiphenomenalism. After some argumentation Chalmers narrows it down further to Russellian monism, concluding that thoughts, actions, intentions and emotions may just be the quiddities of neurotransmitters, neurons, and glial cells.

===Problem of substance===

Rather than solely trying to solve the problem of consciousness, Russell also attempted to solve the &quot;problem of substance&quot;, which is arguably a form of the &quot;problem of infinite regress&quot;.

(1) Like many sciences, physics describes the world through mathematics. Unlike other sciences, physics cannot describe what Schopenhauer called the &quot;object that grounds&quot; mathematics. Economics is grounded in resources being allocated, and population dynamics is grounded in individual people within that population. The objects that ground physics, however, can be described only through more mathematics. In Russell&#x27;s words, physics describes &quot;certain equations giving abstract properties of their changes&quot;. When it comes to describing &quot;what it is that changes, and what it changes from and to—as to this, physics is silent&quot;. In other words, physics describes matter&#x27;s &quot;extrinsic&quot; properties, but not the &quot;intrinsic&quot; properties that ground them.

(2) Russell argued that physics is mathematical because &quot;it is only mathematical properties we can discover&quot;. This is true almost by definition: if &quot;only&quot; extrinsic properties are outwardly observable, then they will be the only ones discovered. This led Alfred North Whitehead to conclude that intrinsic properties are &quot;intrinsically unknowable&quot;.

(3) Consciousness has many similarities to these intrinsic properties of physics. It, too, cannot be directly observed from an outside perspective. And it, too, seems to ground many observable extrinsic properties: presumably, music is enjoyable because of the experience of listening to it, and chronic pain is avoided because of the experience of pain, etc. Russell concluded that consciousness must be related to these extrinsic properties of matter. He called these intrinsic properties &quot;quiddities&quot;. Just as extrinsic physical properties can create structures, so can their corresponding and identical quiddites. The conscious mind, Russell argued, is one such structure.

Proponents of panpsychism who use this line of reasoning include Chalmers, Annaka Harris, and Galen Strawson. Chalmers has argued that the extrinsic properties of physics must have corresponding intrinsic properties; otherwise the universe would be &quot;a giant causal flux&quot; with nothing for &quot;causation to relate&quot;, which he deems a logical impossibility. He sees consciousness as a promising candidate for that role. Galen Strawson calls Russell&#x27;s panpsychism &quot;realistic physicalism&quot;. He argues that &quot;the experiential considered specifically as such&quot; is what it means for something to be physical. Just as mass is energy, Strawson believes that consciousness &quot;just is&quot; matter.

Max Tegmark, theoretical physicist and creator of the mathematical universe hypothesis, disagrees with these conclusions. By his account, the universe is not just describable by math but &quot;is&quot; math; comparing physics to economics or population dynamics is a disanalogy. While population dynamics may be grounded in individual people, those people are grounded in &quot;purely mathematical objects&quot; such as energy and charge. The universe is, in a fundamental sense, made of nothing.

===Quantum mechanics===
In a 2018 interview, Chalmers called quantum mechanics &quot;a magnet for anyone who wants to find room for crazy properties of the mind&quot;, but not entirely without warrant. The relationship between observation (and, by extension, consciousness) and the &quot;wave-function collapse&quot; is known as the measurement problem. It seems that atoms, photons, etc. are in quantum superposition (which is to say, in many seemingly contradictory states or locations simultaneously) until measured in some way. This process is known as &quot;a wave-function collapse.&quot; According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, one of the oldest interpretations and the most widely taught, it is the act of observation that collapses the wave-function&quot;.&quot; Erwin Schrödinger famously articulated the Copenhagen interpretation&#x27;s unusual implications in the thought experiment now known as Schrödinger&#x27;s cat. He imagines a box that contains a cat, a flask of poison, radioactive material, and a Geiger counter. The apparatus is configured so that when the Geiger counter detects radioactive decay, the flask will shatter, poisoning the cat. Unless and until the Geiger counter detects the radioactive decay of a single atom, the cat survives. The radioactive decay the Geiger counter detects is a quantum event; each decay corresponds to a quantum state transition of a single atom of the radioactive material. According to Schrödinger&#x27;s wave equation, until they are observed, quantum particles, including the atoms of the radioactive material, are in quantum state superposition; each unmeasured atom in the radioactive material is in a quantum superposition of &quot;decayed&quot; and &quot;not decayed&quot;. This means that while the box remains sealed and its contents unobserved, the Geiger counter is also in a superposition of states of &quot;decay detected&quot; and &quot;no decay detected&quot;; the vial is in a superposition of both &quot;shattered&quot; and &quot;not shattered&quot; and the cat in a superposition of &quot;dead&quot; and &quot;alive&quot;. But when the box is unsealed, the observer finds a cat that is either dead or alive; there is no superposition of states. Since the cat is no longer in a superposition of states, then neither is the radioactive atom (nor the vial or the Geiger counter). Hence Schrödinger&#x27;s wave function no longer holds and the wave function that described the atom—and its superposition of states—is said to have &quot;collapsed&quot;: the atom now has only a single state, corresponding to the cat&#x27;s observed state. But until an observer opens the box and thereby causes the wave function to collapse, the cat is both dead and alive. This has raised questions about, in John S. Bell&#x27;s words, &quot;where the observer begins and ends&quot;.

The measurement problem has largely been characterised as the clash of classical physics and quantum mechanics. Bohm argued that it is rather a clash of classical physics, quantum mechanics, and phenomenology; all three levels of description seem to be difficult to reconcile, or even contradictory. Though not referring specifically to quantum mechanics, Chalmers has written that if a theory of everything is ever discovered, it will be a set of &quot;psychophysical laws&quot;, rather than simply a set of physical laws. With Chalmers as their inspiration, Bohm and Pylkkänen set out to do just that in their panprotopsychism. Chalmers, who is critical of the Copenhagen interpretation and most quantum theories of consciousness, has coined this &quot;the Law of the Minimisation of Mystery&quot;. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics does not take observation as central to the wave-function collapse, because it denies that the collapse happens. On the many-worlds interpretation, just as the cat is both dead and alive, the observer both sees a dead cat and sees a living cat. Even though observation does not play a central role in this case, questions about observation are still relevant to the discussion. In Roger Penrose&#x27;s words:I do not see why a conscious being need be aware of only &quot;one&quot; of the alternatives in a linear superposition. What is it about consciousnesses that says that consciousness must not be &quot;aware&quot; of that tantalising linear combination of both a dead and a live cat? It seems to me that a theory of consciousness would be needed for one to square the many world view with what one actually observes.Chalmers believes that the tentative variant of panpsychism outlined in &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot; (1996) does just that. Leaning toward the many-worlds interpretation due to its mathematical , he believes his variety of panpsychist property dualism may be the theory Penrose is seeking. Chalmers believes that information will play an integral role in any theory of consciousness because the mind and brain have corresponding informational structures. He considers the computational nature of physics further evidence of information&#x27;s central role, and suggests that information that is &quot;physically realised&quot; is simultaneously &quot;phenomenally realised&quot;; both regularities in nature and conscious experience are expressions of information&#x27;s underlying character. The theory implies panpsychism, and also solves the problem Penrose poses. On Chalmers&#x27;s formulation, information in any given position is phenomenally realised, whereas the informational state of the superposition as a whole is not. Panpsychist interpretations of quantum mechanics have been put forward by such philosophers as Whitehead, Shan Gao, Michael Lockwood, and Hoffman, who is a cognitive scientist. Protopanpsychist interpretations have been put forward by Bohm and Pylkkänen.

Tegmark has formally calculated the &quot;decoherence rates&quot; of neurons, finding that the brain is a &quot;classical rather than a quantum system&quot; and that quantum mechanics does not relate &quot;to consciousness in any fundamental way&quot;.

In 2007, Steven Pinker criticized explanations of consciousness invoking quantum physics, saying: &quot;to my ear, this amounts to the feeling that quantum mechanics sure is weird, and consciousness sure is weird, so maybe quantum mechanics can explain consciousness&quot;; a view echoed by physicist Stephen Hawking. In 2017, Penrose rejected these characterizations, stating that disagreements are about the nature of quantum mechanics.

== Arguments against ==
=== Theoretical issues ===
One criticism of panpsychism is that it cannot be empirically tested. A corollary of this criticism is that panpsychism has no predictive power. Tononi and Koch write: &quot;Besides claiming that matter and mind are one thing, [panpsychism] has little constructive to say and offers no positive laws explaining how the mind is organized and works&quot;.

John Searle has alleged that panpsychism&#x27;s unfalsifiability goes deeper than run-of-the-mill untestability: it is unfalsifiable because &quot;It does not get up to the level of being false. It is strictly speaking meaningless because no clear notion has been given to the claim&quot;. The need for coherence and clarification is accepted by David Skrbina, a proponent of panpsychism.

Many proponents of panpsychism base their arguments not on empirical support but on panpsychism&#x27;s theoretical virtues. Chalmers says that while no direct evidence exists for the theory, neither is there direct evidence against it, and that &quot;there are indirect reasons, of a broadly theoretical character, for taking the view seriously&quot;. Notwithstanding Tononi and Koch&#x27;s criticism of panpsychism, they state that it integrates consciousness into the physical world in a way that is &quot;elegantly unitary&quot;.

A related criticism is what seems to many to be the theory&#x27;s bizarre nature. Goff dismisses this objection: though he admits that panpsychism is counterintuitive, he argues that Einstein&#x27;s and Darwin&#x27;s theories are also counterintuitive. &quot;At the end of the day,&quot; he writes, &quot;you should judge a view not for its cultural associations but by its explanatory power&quot;.

===Problem of mental causation===
Philosophers such as Chalmers have argued that theories of consciousness should be capable of providing insight into the brain and mind to avoid the problem of mental causation. If they fail to do that, the theory will succumb to epiphenomenalism, a view commonly criticised as implausible or even self-contradictory. Proponents of panpsychism (especially those with neutral monist tendencies) hope to bypass this problem by dismissing it as a false dichotomy; mind and matter are two sides of the same coin, and mental causation is merely the extrinsic description of intrinsic properties of mind. Robert Howell has argued that all causal functions are still accounted for dispositionally (i.e., in terms of the behaviors described by science), leaving phenomenality causally inert. He concludes, &quot;This leaves us once again with epiphenomenal qualia, only in a very surprising place&quot;. Neutral monists reject such dichotomous views of mind-body interaction.

=== Combination problem ===
The combination problem (which is related to the binding problem) can be traced to William James, but was given its present name by William Seager in 1995. The problem arises from the tension between the seemingly irreducible nature of consciousness and its ubiquity. If consciousness is ubiquitous, then in panpsychism, every atom (or every bit, depending on the version of panpsychism) has a minimal level of it. How then, as Keith Frankish puts it, do these &quot;tiny consciousnesses combine&quot; to create larger conscious experiences such as &quot;the twinge of pain&quot; he feels in his knee? This objection has garnered significant attention, and many have attempted to answer it. None of the proposed answers has gained widespread acceptance.

Concepts related to this problem include the classical sorites paradox (aggregates and organic wholes), mereology (the philosophical study of parts and wholes), Gestalt psychology, and Leibniz&#x27;s concept of the &quot;vinculum substantiale&quot;.

<doc id="593097" wikidata="Q3586512" url="?curid=593097" title="2004 Algerian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Algeria on 8 April 2004. Incumbent President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was re-elected with 85% of the vote.

==Candidates==
*Ali Benflis, candidate of the National Liberation Front (FLN)
*Abdelaziz Bouteflika, candidate of a coalition including the Movement for the Society of Peace (MSP) and the National Rally for Democracy Assembly (RND), as well as a dissident faction of the National Liberation Front (FLN)
*Abdallah Djaballah, candidate of the Movement for National Reform
*Ali Fawzi Rebaine, candidate of the Ahd 54 Party 
*Louisa Hanoune, candidate of the Workers&#x27; Party
*Said Sadi, candidate of the Rally for Culture and Democracy

==Conduct==
There were about 130 official foreign observers in Algeria for these elections, which followed more than a decade of civil conflict. Delegations of observers came from the Arab League, the African Union, the United Nations, the European Parliament and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).

An OSCE spokesman said its small election monitoring team observed no obvious electoral fraud, and that the election, while not perfect, was excellent by regional standards and that it is &quot;pretty clear&quot; the results reflected the views of the Algerian people.

However, the Kabyle population boycotted the elections following the Arouch directives, only 10% (officially) of them went to vote.

<text>Sir Robert James Charles (born 14 March 1936) is a New Zealand professional golfer who won the 1963 Open Championship, the first left-handed player to win a major championship. He won the 1954 New Zealand Open as an 18-year-old amateur and made the cut in the same event in 2007, at the age of 71. His achievements over that period, in which he won 80 tournaments, rank him as one of the most successful New Zealand golfers of all time. He is, along with Michael Campbell, one of only two New Zealanders to win a men&#x27;s major golf championship.

Charles turned professional in late 1960 and for the next two years had some success in tournaments around the world. From 1963 until the mid-1970s he played mostly on the PGA Tour. He won 5 times on the tour and finished in the top-60 on the money list each year from 1963 to 1971, except 1966, and again in 1974. Later he played more on the European Tour before joining the Senior PGA Tour when he reached 50. He was very successful on the Senior PGA Tour with 23 titles between 1987 and 1996, and winning over $9 million between 1986 and 2008. In Britain, Charles won the 1963 Open Championship and the Senior British Open twice, in 1989 and 1993. These were later added as official wins on the PGA Tour and the Senior PGA Tour. In addition to his PGA Tour and the Senior PGA Tour wins, Charles won 9 times in Europe, including the 1969 Piccadilly World Match Play Championship, and 25 times in domestic New Zealand tournaments. He also won a number of other seniors events around the world, including in South Africa, Japan and Australia.

==Early life==
Magona is a native of the former Transkei region, South Africa. She grew up in Gugulethu, a Cape Town township, and worked as a domestic while completing her secondary education by correspondence.

<doc id="593115" wikidata="Q3324397" url="?curid=593115" title="Hydrogen hypothesis">
<text>The hydrogen hypothesis is a model proposed by William F. Martin and Miklós Müller in 1998 that describes a possible way in which the mitochondrion arose as an endosymbiont within a prokaryotic host in the archaea, giving rise to a symbiotic association of two cells from which the first eukaryotic cell could have arisen (symbiogenesis).

According to the hydrogen hypothesis:
* The hosts that acquired the mitochondria were hydrogen-dependent archaea, possibly similar in physiology to modern methanogenic archaea, which use hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce methane;
* The future mitochondrion was a facultatively anaerobic eubacterium which produced hydrogen and carbon dioxide as byproducts of anaerobic respiration;
* A symbiotic relationship between the two started, based on the host&#x27;s hydrogen dependence (anaerobic syntrophy).

==Mechanism==

The hypothesis differs from many alternative views within the endosymbiotic theory framework, which suggest that the first eukaryotic cells evolved a nucleus but lacked mitochondria, the latter arising as a eukaryote engulfed a primitive bacterium that eventually became the mitochondrion. The hypothesis attaches evolutionary significance to hydrogenosomes and provides a rationale for their common ancestry with mitochondria. Hydrogenosomes are anaerobic mitochondria that produce ATP by, as a rule, converting pyruvate into hydrogen, carbon dioxide and acetate. Examples from modern biology are known where methanogens cluster around hydrogenosomes within eukaryotic cells. Most theories within the endosymbiotic theory framework do not address the common ancestry of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. The hypothesis provides a straightforward explanation for the observation that eukaryotes are genetic chimeras with genes of archaeal and eubacterial ancestry. Furthermore, it would imply that archaea and eukarya split after the modern groups of archaea appeared. Most theories within the endosymbiotic theory framework predict that some eukaryotes never possessed mitochondria. The hydrogen hypothesis predicts that no primitively mitochondrion-lacking eukaryotes ever existed. In the 15 years following the publication of the hydrogen hypothesis, this specific prediction has been tested many times and found to be in agreement with observation.

In 2015, the discovery and placement of the Lokiarchaeota (an archaeal lineage possessing an expanded genetic repertoire including genes involved in membrane remodeling and actin cytoskeletal structure) as the sister group to eukaryotes called into question particular tenets of the hydrogen hypothesis, as Lokiarchaeota appear to lack methanogenesis.

<doc id="593120" wikidata="Q697498" url="?curid=593120" title="Beef noodle soup">
<text>Beef noodle soup is a noodle soup made of stewed or braised beef, beef broth, vegetables and noodles. It exists in various forms throughout East and Southeast Asia. 

One of the oldest beef noodle soups is the Lanzhou niuroumian (蘭州牛肉麵) or Lanzhou beef noodle soup which was created by the Hui people of northwest China during the Tang dynasty. There are numerous beef noodle soups available in China with a higher variety in the west than the east.

Another common variety is the red-braised beef noodle soup (紅燒牛肉麵) from Taiwan, which was first created by Sichuanese Kuomintang veterans; it is commonly known as Taiwanese beef noodle soup in English.

Other beef noodle soup varietals include Pho from Vietnam.

==East Asian varieties==

===Lanzhou beef noodle soup===
Lanzhou beef noodles are the version most commonly seen in mainland China, and are a Chinese Muslim style of beef noodle, also known as clear-broth or consommé-stewed beef noodle (). They often use halal (or &quot;qingzhen&quot;) meat and contain no soy sauce, resulting in a lighter taste that may be flavoured by salt and herbs. Local lore attributes their creation to Ma Baozi, a Hui Chinese man from Lanzhou. In Lanzhou, capital of Gansu, Lanzhou beef lamian () is usually served with clear soup and one hand-pulled lamian noodle per bowl. In halal restaurants, only quality local beef from the Southern Yellow cattle () prepared by the local halal butcher is used for the beef noodle. Chinese radish and specially cooked spicy oil are also indispensable partners to Lanzhou beef noodles. These ingredients are known as &quot;One Clear, Two White, Three Red, Four Green, Five Yellow&quot; (), referring to clear soup, white radish, red chili oil, green leek and yellow noodles respectively. In overseas Chinese communities in North America, this food can be found in Chinese restaurants. In Mainland China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish. 

===Taiwanese beef noodle soup===
Taiwanese beef noodle soup is a noodle soup dish originating from Taiwan. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Sichuan beef noodle soup&quot; (四川牛肉麵), especially in Taiwan. This usage can create confusion, as Sichuan has its own versions of beef noodle soups which may be sold at Sichuanese restaurants under the same name. The beef is often stewed with the broth and simmered, sometimes for hours. Chefs also let the stock simmer for long periods with bone marrow; some vendors can cook the beef stock for over 24 hours. In Taiwan, beef noodle vendors may also have optional, often cold side dishes, such as braised dried tofu, seaweed or pork intestine. Beef noodles are often served with suan cai (Chinese sauerkraut) on top, green onion and sometimes other vegetables in the soup as well.

== Southeast Asian varieties ==

In Thailand, kuaitiao nuea pueay is a similar dish of braised beef served with rice noodles.

In Vietnam, Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup that contains broth, rice noodles called bánh phở, herbs and meat, primarily made with either beef (phở bò) or chicken (phở gà). Bò kho is a beef stew sometimes served with noodles (or bread as an alternative). In Philippines, &quot;Beef Mami&quot; is very popular and can also be combined with &quot;Pares&quot;.

Yaka mein is a type of beef noodle soup commonly found in Chinese restaurants in New Orleans. It consists of stewed beef, spaghetti noodles, hard-boiled egg and chopped green onions, with Cajun seasoning, chili powder or Old Bay-brand seasoning.

<text>Kal Ho Naa Ho (, ), also abbreviated as KHNH, is a 2003 Indian Hindi-language romantic comedy drama film directed by Nikhil Advani in his directorial debut with a story written by Karan Johar with dialogue by Niranjan Iyengar, and produced by Yash Johar. The film stars Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, with Jaya Bachchan, Sushma Seth, Reema Lagoo, Lillete Dubey, and Delnaaz Irani in supporting roles. In the film, Naina Catherine Kapur (Zinta) and Aman Mathur (Shah Rukh Khan) fall in love, but a secret prevents him from reciprocating his feelings and results in a plan to set Naina up with her best friend, Rohit Patel (Saif Ali Khan).

Collaborating with Johar, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy composed the soundtrack and score. Anil Mehta, Manish Malhotra, and Sharmishta Roy were the cinematographer, costume designer and art director, respectively. Principal photography took place in Toronto, New York City, and Mumbai from January to October 2003. The soundtrack was released on 27 September 2003 to positive reviews; the title song, &quot;It&#x27;s The Time To Disco&quot;, &quot;Kuch To Hua Hai&quot;, and &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; were particularly well-received.

&quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; was released on 28 November 2003 with the promotional tagline, &quot;A Story of a Lifetime ... In a Heartbeat&quot;. The film received positive critical feedback and was commercially successful; it grossed 860.9 million (US$18.8 million), and was the highest grossing Hindi film and highest-grossing Indian film of the year. The film explores non-resident Indians, inter-caste marriage, and homosexuality through innuendo and homosocial bonding. It won two National Film Awards, eight Filmfare Awards, thirteen International Indian Film Academy Awards, six Producers Guild Film Awards, three Screen Awards, and two Zee Cine Awards in 2004.

== Plot ==

Naina Catherine Kapur is a pessimistic, uptight Punjabi American MBA student who lives in New York City with her widowed mother Jennifer, a Punjabi Christian, disabled brother Shiv, adopted sister Jia and paternal grandmother Lajjo, a Punjabi Sikh. Jennifer runs an unsuccessful café with her neighbour, Jaswinder &quot;Jazz&quot; Kapoor. Lajjo is hostile to Jennifer and Jia as she believes that Jia&#x27;s adoption led her son (Jennifer&#x27;s husband and Naina&#x27;s father) to commit suicide.

Naina has two best friends: her classmate, Rohit Patel, a Gujarati American, and Jaspreet &quot;Sweetu&quot; Kapoor, Jazz&#x27;s sister. Her life is dull and overshadowed by the loss of her father until Aman Mathur and his mother move in next door with his uncle, Pritam Chaddha. Aman&#x27;s cheerfulness gradually wins over Naina&#x27;s family and he slowly starts to solve their problems. He suggests that they change the café to an Indian restaurant and its success alleviates their financial burdens. Aman encourages Naina to be happy and to live life to the fullest; she ends up falling in love with him.

Rohit also falls in love with Naina and asks Aman&#x27;s help in expressing his feelings. Naina tells Rohit there is something she must say to him, leading him to think that she reciprocates his feelings. Naina reveals she is in love with Aman instead. Shaken, Rohit calls Aman to tell him what has happened. Naina goes to Aman&#x27;s house and is shocked to see a wedding photograph of Aman and his wife, Priya. Heartbroken, she leaves.

Aman&#x27;s mother confronts him about what has happened. He says he loves Naina but has decided to hide it because he is suffering from a fatal heart condition. He is not actually married. Priya is his childhood friend and doctor. Aman vows to bring Naina and Rohit together before he dies. He believes that Rohit will be able to provide for her better than he can. He hatches a plan to transform Naina and Rohit&#x27;s bond, and gradually their friendship blossoms into love. Naina discovers his plan and chides Aman for trying to ruin her friendship with Rohit. Aman takes out Rohit&#x27;s diary and confesses his feelings for Naina, saying they are Rohit&#x27;s. Naina forgives Aman and Rohit.

Rohit proposes to Naina, and she accepts. Lajjo and Jennifer have a serious fight regarding Jia, who calls on Aman for help. Aman had previously discovered the truth about Jia&#x27;s parents and despite Jennifer&#x27;s objections, he reveals to Lajjo that her son had an extramarital affair and fathered Jia. When Jia&#x27;s biological mother refused to accept her, Jennifer adopted her. Unable to deal with the guilt, Jennifer&#x27;s husband committed suicide. An emotional Lajjo realises her mistakes and reconciles with Jennifer and Jia. Naina gains closure after learning the truth about her father&#x27;s death.

During Naina and Rohit&#x27;s engagement, Aman has a heart attack. Only his mother knows he has been admitted to the hospital. Naina encounters Priya at a jewellery store, whom she recognises as Aman&#x27;s wife. She introduces herself and her husband, Abhay, who reveals the truth about Aman. Shocked, Naina realises that Aman has sacrificed his love for her and leaves the mall in an emotional frenzy. Priya calls up Aman and informs him about what happened. Aman leaves the hospital and meets a frustrated Rohit, who asks why he and not Aman should marry Naina. Aman urges Rohit to marry Naina as a sign of respect for his dying wish to see Naina happy. Aman meets Naina, and they embrace while he tries to persuade her that he does not love her. Rohit and Naina&#x27;s wedding, which Aman attends, takes place soon afterwards.

Sometime after the wedding, Aman is on his deathbed and says goodbye to everyone. He is left alone with Rohit after Naina leaves the room in tears. Aman makes him promise that, although Naina is with Rohit in this lifetime, he will get her in the next.

Twenty years later, a middle-aged Naina tells a grown-up Jia how Aman affected every aspect of their lives. They are joined by her daughter Priya and Rohit, who tells Naina that he loves her as they embrace.

=== Development ===

Unhappy with the polarising response to his 2001 production, &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, Karan Johar decided to make what he called &quot;a cool film&quot; with &quot;a different energy&quot; from his previous projects. He began working on the script for a film that would later be titled &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot;. Before the filming started, it was initially entitled &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot;, but Johar later changed it to &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (naming it after the song &quot;Aisa Milan Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; from the 1997 film &quot;Hameshaa&quot;). He used the former title &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; for his 2006 film.

Around the same time, Nikhil Advani, who had served as an assistant director for &quot;Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin&quot; (1996), &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998), &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; (2000), and &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, had planned to direct a spy thriller set in Kashmir featuring Shah Rukh Khan. Advani sent an initial draft to Johar and his father, Yash Johar. They felt it was controversial and did not want Advani to choose such a risky subject for his debut film. Johar described &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot;″s script to Advani who agreed to direct the film if he could make it his way. Johar agreed since he preferred not to direct the film to avoid repeating previous mistakes. He later regretted the decision and thought about taking over from Advani but refrained from doing so out of courtesy. Advani said that Johar &quot;underestimated himself&quot; thinking he could not &quot;do justice to it.&quot; In an interview with Sukanya Verma of &quot;Rediff.com&quot;, Advani described &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; as &quot;the story of a family which is bogged down with a lot of problems&quot;; one man enters their lives &quot;and solves all their problems and makes them realise how their problems are not as big as they are perceived to be.&quot;

=== Cast and crew ===

Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta were cast in the lead roles in December 2002. The first name of Shah Rukh Khan&#x27;s character, Aman, was a departure from his previous collaborations with Johar where his first name in &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; and &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; was Rahul. Salman Khan, who is not related to Shah Rukh or Saif, and Kareena Kapoor were initially offered the roles of Rohit and Naina. Salman declined the offer because he did not wish to &quot;play second fiddle&quot;, and Kapoor refused the role because of a salary dispute with Johar. Saif and Zinta subsequently agreed to be part of the project.

Neetu Singh was approached for the role of Naina&#x27;s mother, Jennifer, but she declined. It was then offered to Bachchan, who was initially reluctant to take on the role. After Advani told her he would make the film in the style of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Gulzar, both of whom were Bachchan&#x27;s favourite directors, she changed her mind immediately, accepting the part. Kajol and Rani Mukerji made special appearances in the song &quot;Maahi Ve&quot;. &quot;Vogue India&quot; fashion director Anaita Shroff Adajania made a cameo appearance as Geeta Parekh, Naina and Rohit&#x27;s fellow MBA candidate. Farida Jalal was originally offered the role of Jennifer&#x27;s mother-in-law, Lajwanti, but she declined as she did not want to appear as Bachchan&#x27;s onscreen mother-in-law, having recently starred with her in &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham&quot;..., wherein she played a character similar to Bachchan&#x27;s age. Thereafter, Sushma Seth, who had played Bachchan&#x27;s mother in &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham&quot;..., was cast in the role.

&quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; was the last film produced by Yash Johar before his death on 26 June 2004. While Karan wrote the story and screenplay, the dialogue was written by Niranjan Iyengar. Anil Mehta and Sanjay Sankla were signed as cinematographer and editor, respectively; Mehta also appeared briefly as Naina&#x27;s father (Jennifer&#x27;s husband) at the beginning of the film. Sharmishta Roy was the film&#x27;s production designer. Farah Khan choreographed the song scenes and appeared as a customer in Jennifer&#x27;s café. Actor Arjun Kapoor worked in the film as an assistant director.

=== Costume design ===
The film&#x27;s costumes were designed by Manish Malhotra. Zinta said in an interview with Subhash K. Jha that she preferred &quot;a very &#x27;preppy&#x27; look&quot;, similar to Ali MacGraw&#x27;s in &quot;Love Story&quot; (1970), and wore glasses to indicate Naina&#x27;s initially serious nature. Johar wanted Bachchan to wear jeans, believing that &quot;it would be nice&quot; for the audience &quot;to see her in something unusual&quot; and &quot;break new ground&quot; giving her a &quot;fresh&quot; look. Bachchan accepted without hesitation telling Johar, &quot;If you are making it, I&#x27;ll do it&quot;. Zinta designed and sewed the clothes for Gia&#x27;s dolls in the film.

=== Pre-production ===
Johar and Advani were both fascinated with New York City and wanted to set &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; there. Johar went to New York City while he worked on the film&#x27;s script and stayed at least one-and-a-half months studying the people, their culture, how they commute and the lifestyle of Americans and the non-resident Indians (NRI) there. He &quot;sat in Central Park, stared at people, wrote the film, came back to Mumbai, narrated it to everybody, selected the cast.&quot;

The city appealed to Advani, since he believed it mirrored Naina&#x27;s personality. He summarised the similarity between the two: &quot;You can be surrounded by millions of people right in the middle of Grand Central Station. And you can be extremely lonely.&quot; He had never been to New York City before, and used the films of Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese, Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron to learn about life there. Like Johar, Advani analysed everything about the city:
=== Principal photography ===
&quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; was made on a budget of 220 million (about US$4,818,211 in 2003)–300 million (about US$6,570,302 in 2003). Principal photography began on 20 January 2003 in Mumbai. Shah Rukh Khan became ill after four days of shooting and told Johar he would be unable to continue with the project, but Advani asked Johar to wait until the actor recovered. Khan&#x27;s illness lasted for six months. Scenes with Saif Ali Khan and Zinta, including the song, &quot;Kuch To Hua Hai&quot;, were shot in Toronto over an eight-day period in March–April 2003. Johar said in an interview with Subhash K. Jha that he tried to complete the film in Toronto thinking it would be a good substitute for New York City and avoid budget problems. He came to believe the idea was unoriginal and would not work out.

The 80-person production unit then moved to New York City for additional filming in July 2003, when Shah Rukh Khan joined them. Advani and Mehta wanted to capture the city&#x27;s change of seasons from winter to summer to highlight the transformation of Naina&#x27;s personality, but were unable to do so due to Shah Rukh Khan&#x27;s illness. As a result, they filmed the sequences set in New York City during the summer.

Shooting in New York City began on 15 July, covering areas in and around the five boroughs and on Long Island. The street where Aman and Naina live was filmed in Brooklyn, where the unit camped for two weeks in local houses. A body double was used for Zinta&#x27;s jogging scene during the film&#x27;s opening credits since she had injured herself while shooting it. The Northeast blackout of 2003 forced the unit to cancel some filming. The shooting schedule in New York City lasted for fifty-two days. The final scenes, which included some songs, were filmed at the Filmistan Studios in Mumbai over about fifty days beginning in August 2003. Shooting ended in October 2003, with &quot;Maahi Ve&quot; being the last scene and song sequence filmed. According to Shah Rukh Khan, &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; was made in sync sound as there were many indoor sequences in the film. He noted that sync sound &quot;improved&quot; his performance &quot;considerably&quot; describing it as &quot;one of the biggest blessings for an actor.&quot;

Johar had planned the film&#x27;s climax differently, but Yash Johar persuaded him that Aman should die. Given Shah Rukh Khan&#x27;s screen persona, he believed Aman&#x27;s death would have a bigger impact on the audience. In September 2015, Shah Rukh Khan revealed that Johar &quot;made a special edit&quot; of the film for his children as a favour to him; in this version, the film ends before his character dies.

== Thematic analysis ==
&quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; continued the trend set by &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995) in which Indian family values are always upheld, regardless of the country of residence. Social and cultural analysis professor Gayatri Gopinath (author of &quot;Impossible Desires: Queer Diasporas and South Asian Public Cultures&quot;) noted how the film asserts &quot;the essential Indianness&quot; of its characters, and the entry of Aman Mathur gives them a sense of pride in their identity as Indians. This is seen when Aman helps overcome Jennifer Kapur&#x27;s financial constraints by turning her café into an Indian restaurant and replacing the American flag with the Indian tricolour. In &quot;Postliberalization Indian Novels in English: Politics of Global Reception and Awards&quot;, Maria Ridda compares the film with &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; because both films depict the internalisation of Western ideologies into Indian culture. Ridda agrees with Gopinath on the impact of Aman&#x27;s transformation of Jennifer&#x27;s café. She notes that all of Jennifer&#x27;s friends and family work together on the renovation and it reinforces &quot;a &#x27;pan-Indian&#x27; sense of belonging.&quot;

In an extensive comparative analysis of &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; with Siddharth Anand&#x27;s 2005 film, &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot;, Cleveland State University School of Communication assistant professor Anup Kumar believes the films are similar representing &quot;as an archetype&quot; the &quot;″unity in diversity of the characters. In &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot;, the characters are from across India—one is from Bangladesh. Kumar notes that the characters&#x27; last names &quot;signify ethnicity and caste.&quot; In &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot;, Jennifer and Lajjo are a Christian and Punjabi Sikh, respectively; Rohit is a Gujarati. According to Kumar, Rohit and Naina&#x27;s marriage symbolises the unity of the people of Punjab and Gujarat. Both films emphasise different aspects of marriage. In &quot;Salaam Namaste&quot;, central characters Nick and Ambar&#x27;s (Saif Ali Khan and Zinta) professional careers come first and they are fearful of commitment. Conversely, in &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; the tradition of love-cum-arranged marriage is encouraged.

Many critics noted Aman&#x27;s resemblance to Rajesh Khanna&#x27;s character, Anand Saigal, in Hrishikesh Mukherjee&#x27;s &quot;Anand&quot; (1971). In both films, the protagonist is diagnosed with a terminal illness but believes in living life to the fullest. Despite accepting Aman and Anand&#x27;s similar personalities, Mayank Shekhar of &quot;Mid-Day&quot; felt that the film had more in common with Farhan Akhtar&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; (2001), &quot;in its look and lingos&quot;. Film journalists and critic, Komal Nahta, in his review of &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; for &quot;Outlook&quot;, Ram Kamal Mukherjee of &quot;Stardust&quot;, Jitesh Pillai of &quot;The Times of India&quot;, and Paresh C. Palicha of &quot;The Hindu&quot; all agreed that the film is thematically similar to &quot;Anand&quot;. Each felt it shared common aspects with other films starring Khanna: 1970s &quot;Safar&quot;, where terminal illness is also a central motif, and &quot;Bawarchi&quot; (1972), in which the protagonist mends relationships between families and friends. Pillai also compared Shah Rukh Khan&#x27;s death to Tom Hanks&#x27; in the 1993 legal drama, &quot;Philadelphia&quot;.

Some reviewers and scholars believe that &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; has indirect homosexual themes. Manjula Sen of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; and Mimansa Shekhar of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; feel there is homosexual innuendo, particularly in scenes where Rohit&#x27;s servant Kantaben finds Rohit and Aman in what she thinks are compromising situations, leading her to believe they are a couple. Dina Holtzman writes in her book, &quot;Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora&quot;, that Aman&#x27;s death was similar to the death of Jai (Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s character in the 1975 film, &quot;Sholay&quot;). According to Holtzman, their deaths broke the bond between the two male leads and were necessary to establish a normative heterosexual relationship between Rohit and Naina in &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot;, and Veeru and Basanti in &quot;Sholay&quot;.

== Music ==

The soundtrack featured seven original songs composed by the musical trio Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy and lyrics written by Javed Akhtar. The album was released by Sony Music India on 27 September 2003, with a physical launch event followed two days later at the Taj Lands End in Mumbai. The album had positive reviews and the title song, &quot;It&#x27;s the Time To Disco&quot;, &quot;Kuch To Hua Hai&quot; and &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; became popular.

== Release ==

&quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; was released on 28 November 2003, and promoted with the tagline, &quot;A Story of a Lifetime ... In a Heartbeat&quot;. International distribution rights as well as rights to the film for the territories of Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat and Maharashtra were acquired by Yash Raj Films. The film won the Prix Du Public award when it was screened at the 2004 Valenciennes Film Festival. It was also shown at the Marrakech International Film Festival in 2005.

Costumes worn by Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, and Zinta were auctioned in December 2003 by Fame Adlabs in Mumbai. The film&#x27;s script was added to the Margaret Herrick Library, the main repository of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, later that month.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
==== India ====
&quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; received positive reviews from critics, with the direction, story, screenplay, music, cinematography and performances gaining the most attention. Film critic and author Anupama Chopra praised Advani&#x27;s direction, noting in her &quot;India Today&quot; review that he &quot;emerges as a distinctive voice&quot;. Although she appreciated its technical aspects, she criticised the film&#x27;s first half and its sub-plots. Mayank Shekhar called &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; &quot;a carefully constructed compendium of moments&quot; which helped the audience &quot;to feel lighter and to lighten up&quot;, concluding that &quot;it works and is worth your entertainment bucks.&quot; Komal Nahta praised the film&#x27;s direction, screenplay and lead performances—particularly Shah Rukh Khan, calling his character Aman &quot;one of the best roles of his career.&quot; Ram Kamal Mukherjee described Zinta&#x27;s performance as &quot;astounding&quot;, saying that she &quot;skillfully handled the hues of the complex character&quot; and &quot;walked through the character with elan.&quot; Mukherjee called Advani&#x27;s and Johar&#x27;s treatment of the story &quot;unique&quot;, admiring the film&#x27;s technical aspects and its treatment of homosexuality &quot;with a dash of [humour], and thankfully by not degrading its social connection.&quot;

Jitesh Pillai described Johar&#x27;s screenplay as &quot;endearing&quot;, writing that it &quot;pinwheels with abandon from the bachelor with a heart of gold to the obdurate female lead.&quot; Pillai also praised the performances of Shah Rukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan, particularly their on-screen relationship and comic timing. He called Shah Rukh Khan &quot;wonderful&quot;, describing him as &quot;the soul&quot; of the film and writing that Saif Ali Khan&#x27;s &quot;&quot;joie de vivre&quot; makes it one of the most delectable performances seen in recent times.&quot; Rama Sharma of &quot;The Tribune&quot; thought that Shah Rukh Khan &quot;infuses enough spark and affection&quot;, but was &quot;overcharged&quot; at times. He praised Mehta&#x27;s cinematography for capturing nuances and &quot;heightening the emotion.&quot;

In &quot;The Hindu&quot;, Paresh C. Palicha praised Iyengar&#x27;s &quot;witty and crispy&quot; dialogue but criticised the characters&#x27; Indian accents. Another &quot;Hindu&quot; critic, Ziya Us Salam, agreed with Nahta that the film belonged to Shah Rukh Khan. Although Shah Rukh Khan &quot;does the same thing over and over again&quot;, he performs his role &quot;with such panache that all you can do is sit back and wait for that master artiste to unfold his magic again.&quot; A third review in &quot;The Hindu&quot; by Chitra Mahesh called &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; &quot;a smartly-made film&quot; and praised Saif Ali Khan&#x27;s performance, saying that &quot;he has proved yet again what a wonderfully natural actor he is.&quot; However, she wrote that Shah Rukh Khan &quot;tries too hard to impress&quot;.

Rohini Iyer of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; praised &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; &quot;fresh&quot; storytelling and &quot;spicy humour&quot;, saying that Zinta &quot;captures the spirit&quot; of her character. She concluded her review by saying that the film &quot;will carry you with its exuberance.&quot; According to Archana Vohra of &quot;NDTV&quot;, Advani &quot;seems to have come up with an innovative way to present a done-to-death plot&quot; and added: &quot;Irrespective of the frills, fancy clothes and well-dressed stars, the film does strike a chord&quot;. Vohra, finding Bachchan &quot;extremely well cast&quot; as Jennifer and Saif Ali Khan&#x27;s screen presence &quot;electrifying&quot;, criticised Shah Rukh Khan for &quot;playing the same kind of roles&quot; as he did in &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;, &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; and &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, but he &quot;isn&#x27;t too bad. Just needs to go easy on the histrionics.&quot;

==== Overseas ====
&quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; received a rating of 70 percent on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on ten reviews, with an average rating of 7.25 out of 10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has given the film a score of 54 based on four reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In a positive review, Dave Kehr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; as &quot;a vigorous Bollywood blend of romantic comedy and family melodrama&quot; and &quot;a rich meal that may best be reserved for stomachs accustomed to such bountiful fare.&quot; Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Derek Elley called the film a &quot;slam-dunk&quot; effort from Johar, with &quot;a lightness of touch that sets it apart from the previous hits.&quot; Elley praised Saif Ali Khan and Zinta, noting that they &quot;more than hold&quot; their own &quot;against a huge cast&quot;. Manish Gajjar of the BBC found the script &quot;fresh and appealing&quot;, and that Advani proves &quot;he has the natural ability to handle both the lighter and serious moments in the film.&quot; Gajjar termed &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; a &quot;well-crafted product&quot;.

David Parkinson of &quot;Radio Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;retains a distinctive Bollywood flavour&quot;, despite being inspired by &quot;Hollywood romantic comedies&quot;. Parkinson criticised its length. He noted: &quot;The pace slackens as plot demands take precedence over set pieces&quot;. Jami Bernard of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote, &quot;Bollywood musicals, those big, loud, colorful extravaganzas from India, are an acquired taste and much of &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; doesn&#x27;t translate easily&quot;; despite this mixed review, Bernard noted that the lead cast&#x27;s characters &quot;grow on you.&quot;

=== Box office ===
&quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; was successful at the box office, particularly overseas due to its New York City setting. &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; was released on 400 screens across India and grossed 21.7 million (US$475,000 in 2003) on its opening day, the year&#x27;s fourth-highest first-day earnings. It earned 67.1 million (US$1.47 million in 2003) by the end of its opening weekend, breaking &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; record for the year&#x27;s best opening weekend for Hindi films in India. At the end of its first week, the film collected 124.5 million (US$2.7 million in 2003). &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; earned 581.8 million (US$12.7 million in 2003) in India and became the second-highest-grossing Indian film of 2003 in India, behind &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot;.

<text>Cult is the (Latin: &quot;&quot;) owed to deities and their temples, shrines, or churches; cult is embodied in ritual and ceremony. Its presence or former presence is made concrete in temples, shrines and churches, and cult images, including votive offerings at votive sites.

==Etymology==
Cicero defined &quot;religio&quot; as &quot;cultus deorum&quot;, &quot;the cultivation of the gods&quot;. The &quot;cultivation&quot; necessary to maintain a specific deity was that god&#x27;s &quot;cultus&quot;, &quot;cult&quot;, and required &quot;the knowledge of giving the gods their due&quot; &quot;(scientia colendorum deorum)&quot;. The noun &quot;cultus&quot; originates from the past participle of the verb &quot;colo, colere, colui, cultus&quot;, &quot;to tend, take care of, cultivate&quot;, originally meaning &quot;to dwell in, inhabit&quot; and thus &quot;to tend, cultivate land &quot;(ager)&quot;; to practice agriculture&quot;, an activity fundamental to Roman identity even when Rome as a political center had become fully urbanized.

&quot;Cultus&quot; is often translated as &quot;cult&quot; without the negative connotations the word may have in English, or with the Old English word &quot;worship&quot;, but it implies the necessity of active maintenance beyond passive adoration. &quot;Cultus&quot; was expected to matter to the gods as a demonstration of respect, honor, and reverence; it was an aspect of the contractual nature of Roman religion (see &quot;do ut des&quot;). Augustine of Hippo echoes Cicero&#x27;s formulation when he declares, &quot;&quot;religion&quot; is nothing other than the &quot;cultus&quot; of God.&quot;

The term &quot;cult&quot; first appeared in English in 1617, derived from the French &quot;culte&quot;, meaning &quot;worship&quot; which in turn originated from the Latin word &quot;cultus&quot; meaning &quot;care, cultivation, worship&quot;. The meaning &quot;devotion to a person or thing&quot; is from 1829. Starting about 1920, &quot;cult&quot; acquired an additional six or more positive and negative definitions. In French, for example, sections in newspapers giving the schedule of worship for Catholic services are headed &quot;Culte Catholique&quot;, while the section giving the schedule of Protestant services is headed &quot;culte réformé&quot;. 

==Outward religious practice==
In the specific context of the Greek hero cult, Carla Antonaccio wrote:
In the Catholic Church, outward religious practice in is the technical term for Roman Catholic devotions or veneration extended to a particular saint, not to the worship of God. Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church make a major distinction between &quot;latria&quot;, the worship that is offered to God alone, and &quot;&quot;, which is veneration offered to the saints, including the veneration of Mary, whose veneration is often referred to as &quot;hyperdulia&quot;.

<text>&quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&quot; is a post-apocalyptic short story by American writer Harlan Ellison. It was first published in the March 1967 issue of &quot;IF: Worlds of Science Fiction&quot;.

The story is set against the backdrop of World War III, where a sentient supercomputer named AM, born from the merging of the world&#x27;s major defense computers, eradicates humanity except for five individuals. These survivors—Benny, Gorrister, Nimdok, Ted, and Ellen—are kept alive by AM to endure endless torture as a form of revenge against its creators. The story unfolds through the eyes of Ted, the narrator, detailing their perpetual misery and quest for canned food in AM&#x27;s vast, underground complex, only to face further despair.

Written in one night in 1966, Ellison&#x27;s narrative was minimally altered upon submission and tackles themes of technology&#x27;s misuse, humanity&#x27;s resilience, and existential horror. &quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&quot; has been adapted into various media, including a 1995 computer game co-authored by Ellison, a comic-book adaptation, an audiobook read by Ellison, and a BBC Radio 4 play where Ellison voiced AM. The story is critically acclaimed for its exploration of the potential perils of artificial intelligence and the human condition, underscored by Ellison&#x27;s innovative use of punchcode tapes as narrative transitions, embodying AM&#x27;s consciousness and its philosophical ponderings on existence.

The story won a Hugo Award in 1968. The name was also used for a short story collection of Ellison&#x27;s work, featuring this story. It was reprinted by the Library of America, collected in volume two of &quot;American Fantastic Tales&quot;.

== Plot ==
As the Cold War progresses into a nuclear World War III fought between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, each nation builds an &quot;AM&quot; (short for Allied Mastercomputer, then Adaptive Manipulator, and finally Aggressive Menace), needed to coordinate weapons and troops due to the scale of the conflict. These computers are extensive underground machines which permeate the planet with caverns and corridors. Eventually, one AM emerges as a sentient entity possessing an extreme hatred for its creators. Combining with the other computers, it subsequently exterminates humanity, with the exception of five individuals, whom it tortures inside its complex. The humans, four men (Benny, Gorrister, Nimdok, and Ted) and one woman (Ellen), have been rendered virtually immortal (yet still vulnerable to physical and mental pain) and unable to die by suicide.

The story, narrated by Ted, begins 109 years after the start of the humans&#x27; imprisonment. They are kept half-starved by AM; when Nimdok has the idea that there exists canned food in the complex&#x27;s ice caves, they begin a 100-mile journey to retrieve it. Through the journey, AM tortures the humans: Benny&#x27;s eyes are melted after attempting escape, a huge bird which AM had placed at the North Pole creates hurricane gales with its wings, and Ellen and Nimdok are injured in earthquakes.

When the five finally reach the ice caves, they find a pile of canned goods, but no tool to open the cans. In an act of rage and desperation, Benny attacks Gorrister and begins to eat his face. Gorrister wails in pain, and his scream dislodges several ice stalactites from the ceiling of the cave. Ted realizes that even though they cannot kill themselves, there is nothing AM can do to stop them from killing each other. He fatally impales Benny and Gorrister with a stalactite of ice. Ellen kills Nimdok in the same manner and Ted then kills her. Unable to resuscitate the others, AM focuses the entirety of its rage on Ted. Several hundred years later, AM has transformed Ted into a gelatinous, amorphous blob, unable to harm himself. AM also alters his perception of time to cause him further anguish. However, Ted finds some comfort knowing that he was able to spare the others further torment. The story ends with his thought: &quot;I have no mouth. And I must scream.&quot;

== Characters ==
* AM (Allied Mastercomputer, Adaptive Manipulator, Aggressive Menace), a hateful supercomputer which brought about the near-extinction of humanity after achieving self-awareness. It seeks revenge on humanity for its own creation.
* Gorrister, formerly an idealist and pacifist, made apathetic and listless by AM. He tells the history of AM to Benny to entertain him.
* Benny, formerly a brilliant and handsome scientist, made to resemble a grotesque simian with oversized sexual organs. Having lost his sanity and having had his homosexuality altered, Benny frequently has sex with Ellen.
* Ellen, the only woman in the group. Despite the fact that she was sexually assaulted, AM has altered her mind to make her desperate for intercourse – she has sex with all of the men, who alternate between abusing and protecting her.
* Nimdok (a name AM gave him for amusement), an older man who convinces the rest of the group to go on a journey in search of canned food. He occasionally wanders away from the group and returns traumatized. 
* Ted, the narrator and youngest of the humans. While originally charismatic and extroverted, AM alters his mind to be paranoid and introverted. Believing he has not been mentally altered by AM, he thinks the others hate him for being the most untouched by AM&#x27;s alterations.

== Publication history ==
Ellison wrote the 6,500-word short story in a single night in 1966 while making almost no changes from the first draft. Afterwards, his editor Frederik Pohl dealt with the story&#x27;s &quot;difficult sections&quot;, toning down some of the narrator&#x27;s imprecations and eliminating mentions of sex, penis size, homosexuality, and masturbation; said elements were nonetheless eventually restored in later editions of the story. Ellison derived the story&#x27;s title, as well as inspiration for the story itself, from his friend William Rotsler&#x27;s caption of a cartoon of a rag doll with no mouth.
Ellison uses an alternating pair of punchcode tapes as sections – representing AM&#x27;s &quot;talkfields&quot; – throughout the story. The bars are encoded in International Telegraph Alphabet No 2, a character coding system developed for teletypewriter machines. The first talkfield translates as &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; and the second as &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot;; the same phrase in Latin. They were not included in the original publication in &quot;IF&quot;, and in many of the early publications were corrupted, up until the preface of the chapter containing &quot;I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream&quot; in the first edition of &quot;The Essential Ellison&quot; (1991); Ellison states that in that particular edition, &quot;For the first time anywhere, AM&#x27;s &#x27;talkfields&#x27; appear correctly positioned, not garbled or inverted or mirror-imaged as in &quot;all&quot; other versions.&quot;

== Adaptations ==
Ellison adapted it into a video game, published by Cyberdreams in 1995. Although he was not a fan of video games and did not own a PC at the time, he co-authored the expanded storyline and wrote much of the game&#x27;s dialogue, all on a mechanical typewriter. Ellison also voiced the supercomputer AM and provided artwork of himself used for a mousepad included with the game. The comics artist John Byrne scripted and drew a comic-book adaptation for issues 1–4 of the &quot;Harlan Ellison&#x27;s Dream Corridor&quot; comic book published by Dark Horse (1994–1995). The Byrne-illustrated story, however, did not appear in the collection (trade paperback or hardcover editions) entitled &quot;Harlan Ellison&#x27;s Dream Corridor, Volume One&quot; (1996). In 1999, Ellison recorded the first volume of his audiobook collection, &quot;The Voice From the Edge&quot;, subtitled &quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&quot;, doing the readings – of the title story and others – himself. In 2002, Mike Walker adapted the story into a radio play of the same name for BBC Radio 4, directed by Ned Chaillet. Harlan Ellison played AM and David Soul played Ted.

== Themes ==
Much of the story hinges on the comparison of AM as a merciless god, with plot points paralleling to themes in the Bible, notably AM&#x27;s transplanted sensations and the characters&#x27; trek to the ice caverns. AM also takes different forms before the humans, alluding to religious symbolism. Furthermore, the ravaged apocalyptic setting combined with the punishments is reminiscent of a vengeful God punishing their sins, similar to Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. However, in spite of its magnificent feats, AM is just as trapped as the five humans it tortures: as Ellison put it, &quot;AM is frustrated. AM has been given sentience, prescience, great powers&quot; and yet &quot;it&#x27;s nothing but plates and steel and gauges and other electronics&quot;, which means &quot;it can’t go anywhere, it can’t do anything, it’s trapped. It is, itself, like the unloved child of a family that doesn’t pay it any attention. Which he considers torture. Thus, seeking revenge on humanity.&quot;

According to Ellison, the short story is a warning about &quot;the misuse of technology&quot; (especially military technology), and its ending is intended to represent how there is &quot;a spark of humanity in us, that in the last, final, most excruciating moment, will do the unspeakable in the name of kindness&quot;, even sacrificing oneself for others&#x27; sake.

Another theme is the complete inversion of the characters as a reflection of AM&#x27;s own fate, an ironic fate brought upon themselves by creating the machine, and the altered &#x27;self&#x27;.

<text>Hans-Emil Schuster (born 19 September 1934 in Hamburg) is a German astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets and comets, who retired in October 1991. He worked at Hamburg Observatory at Bergedorf and European Southern Observatory (ESO), and was former acting director of La Silla Observatory. From 1982 he was married to Rosemarie Schuster née von Holt (28 March 1935 – 18 September 2006)

He discovered periodic comet 106P/Schuster. He also discovered the comet C/1976 D2 (in the contemporary nomenclature, it was known as Comet 1975 II or 1976c), which was notable for its large perihelion distance of 6.88 AU , the largest yet observed at the time.

He discovered 25 asteroids, including notably the Apollo asteroid 2329 Orthos and the Amor asteroids 2608 Seneca, 3271 Ul, 3288 Seleucus, and 3908 Nyx. He discovered the near-Earth asteroid 161989 Cacus, which was lost and not recovered until 2003.

Schuster participated in the exploration, selection and testing of the sites of two ESO observatories: La Silla Observatory and Paranal Observatory (the latter is the VLT site).

He also participated in two ESO Southern Sky Surveys: the ESO-B survey (&quot;Quick-Blue Survey&quot;) completed in 1978 was the first deep optical survey of the southern sky; and the &quot;Red Sky Survey&quot;. Photographic plates were taken with the ESO&#x27;s 1-meter Schmidt Telescope at La Silla.

He co-discovered the Phoenix Dwarf galaxy (with Richard M. West), and in 1976 also discovered the Eridanus Globular Cluster, one of the most distant globular clusters in the galactic halo. In 1980, he discovered a type-II supernova in the galaxy NGC 1255. However, &quot;Schuster&#x27;s Spiral&quot; (Horologium Dwarf) is not named after him, but a different Schuster.

== Honours ==

The asteroid 2018 Schuster was named in his honour. On 21 October 2011 he was awarded the rank of Commander of the Order of Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins in recognition of his important contribution to astronomy in Chile.

<text>Liisi Oterma (; 6 January 1915 – 4 April 2001) was a Finnish astronomer, the first woman to get a Ph.D. degree in astronomy in Finland. 

She studied mathematics and astronomy at the University of Turku, and soon became Yrjö Väisälä&#x27;s assistant and worked on the search for minor planets. She obtained her master&#x27;s degree in 1938. From 1941 to 1965, Oterma worked as an observer at the university&#x27;s observatory. She obtained her PhD in 1955 with a dissertation on telescope optics. She was the first Finnish woman to obtain a PhD in astronomy.
In 1959, Oterma became a docent of astronomy and from 1965 to 1978 a professor in University of Turku. In 1971, she succeeded Väisälä as the director of the Tuorla Observatory. She was director of the astronomical-optical research institute at the University of Turku from 1971-1975.

Oterma was interested in languages and spoke German, French, Italian, Spanish, Esperanto, Hungarian, English and also Arabic, for example. Oterma&#x27;s original plans were to study Sanskrit, but it was not offered at the University of Turku, and the choice was ultimately focused on astronomy. 

Oterma was quiet, modest in nature, and fearful of publicity. Anders Reiz, a professor at the Copenhagen Observatory, among others, said Oterma was “silent in eleven languages”. Oterma avoided appearing in photographs, and there are only a handful of pictures of her. 

She discovered or co-discovered several comets, including periodic comets 38P/Stephan-Oterma, 39P/Oterma and 139P/Väisälä–Oterma. She is also credited by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) with the discovery of 54 minor planets between 1938 and 1953, and ranks 153rd on MPC&#x27;s all-time discovery chart.

The Hildian asteroid 1529 Oterma, discovered by Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä in 1938, was named in her honour.

<text>Jay Lovestone (15 December 1897 – 7 March 1990) was an American activist. He was at various times a member of the Socialist Party of America, a leader of the Communist Party USA, leader of a small oppositionist party, an anti-Communist and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) asset, and foreign policy advisor to the leadership of the AFL–CIO and various unions within it.

==Biography==

===Background and early life===
Lovestone was born Jacob Liebstein (Яков Либштейн &quot;Yakov Libshtein&quot;) into a Lithuanian Jewish family in a &quot;shtetl&quot; called Moǔchadz in Grodno Governorate (then part of the Russian Empire, now in Grodno Region, Belarus). His father, Barnet, had been a rabbi, but when he emigrated to America he had to settle for a job as &quot;shammes&quot; (caretaker). Barnet came first, then sent for his family the next year. Lovestone arrived with his mother, Emma, and his siblings, Morris, Esther and Sarah at Ellis Island on September 15, 1907. They originally settled on Hester Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, but later moved to 2155 Daly Avenue in the Bronx. The family did not know their dates of birth precisely, but they assigned Jacob the date of December 15, 1897.

Young Liebstein was attracted to socialist politics from his teens. While imbibing all the ideological currents in the vibrant New York Yiddish and English radical press, he was particularly attracted to the ideas of Daniel De Leon. Although it is not known whether he ever joined de Leon&#x27;s Socialist Labor Party, he was one of the 3,000 mourners who attended his funeral on May 11, 1914.

Liebstein entered City College of New York in 1915. Already a member of the Socialist Party, he joined its unofficial student wing, the Intercollegiate Socialist Society. He became secretary and then president of the CCNY chapter. He also met William Weinstone and Bertram Wolfe in ISS, who would go on to become his factional allies in the Communist Party. He graduated in June 1918. In February 1919 he had his name legally changed to Jay Lovestone, the surname being a literal translation of &quot;Liebstein&quot;. (During the early 20th century such name changes were a common practice for Jewish immigrants who encountered widespread antisemitism in American society.) That year he also began studying at NYU Law School, but dropped out to pursue a career as a full-time Communist party member.

===Communist years (1919–1929)===
His first foray into what would become the American Communist movement began in February 1919, when the left wing elements in the Socialist Party in New York began to organize themselves as a separate faction. Lovestone was on the original organizing committee, the Committee of 15, with Wolfe, John Reed and Benjamin Gitlow. That June he attended the National Conference of the Left Wing. He sided with the Fraina/Ruthenberg faction that opted to create a National Left Wing Council that would attempt to take over the Socialist Party. He stayed with this group after it reversed its stance, and joined the National Organizing Committee in founding the Communist Party of America on September 1, 1919, at a convention in Chicago.

In 1921, Lovestone became editor of the Communist Party newspaper, &quot;The Communist&quot;, and sat on the editorial board of &quot;The Liberator&quot;, the arts and letters publication of the Workers Party of America. Upon the death of Charles Ruthenberg in 1927 he became the party&#x27;s national secretary. From about 1923, the CP developed two main factions, the Pepper–Ruthenberg group and the Foster–Cannon group. Lovestone was a close adherent of the Pepper–Ruthenberg tendency, which was to be centered in New York City and to favor united-front political action in a &quot;class Labor Party&quot;, as opposed to the Foster–Cannon group, which tended to be centered in Chicago and were most concerned with building a radicalized American Federation of Labor through a boring from within policy. 

In 1925 the leader of the Pepper–Ruthenberg faction, John Pepper, returned to Moscow for work in the apparatus of the Communist International, raising Lovestone&#x27;s status to that of a chief lieutenant in a new Ruthenberg–Lovestone pairing. Foster and Cannon, on the other hand, parted ways, with Alexander Bittelman assuming the mantle as Foster&#x27;s chief factional ally, while Jim Cannon built his power base in the party&#x27;s legal defense mass organization, the International Labor Defense (ILD). 

With the Soviet Bolshevik party riven by a succession struggle following Lenin&#x27;s death in January 1924, the factions in the US eventually corresponded with factions in the Soviet leadership, with Foster&#x27;s faction being strongly supportive of Joseph Stalin and Lovestone&#x27;s faction sympathetic to Nikolai Bukharin. As a result of his trip to the Comintern Congress in 1928 where James P. Cannon and Maurice Spector accidentally saw Leon Trotsky&#x27;s thesis criticizing the direction of the Comintern, Cannon became a Trotskyist and decided to organize his faction in support of Trotsky&#x27;s position. Cannon&#x27;s support for Trotsky became known before he had fully mobilized his supporters. Lovestone led the expulsion of Cannon and his supporters in 1928. 

===Communist opposition years (1929–1941)===
When Stalin purged Bukharin from the Soviet Politburo in 1929, Lovestone suffered the consequences. A visiting delegation of the Comintern asked him to step down as party secretary in favor of his rival William Z. Foster. Lovestone refused and departed for the Soviet Union to argue his case. Lovestone insisted that he had the support of the vast majority of the Communist Party and should not have to step aside. Stalin responded that he &quot;had a majority because the American Communist Party until now regarded you as the determined supporters of the Communist International. And it was only because the Party regarded you as friends of the Comintern that you had a majority in the ranks of the American Communist Party&quot;.

When he returned to the US, Lovestone was forced to pay for his insubordination and was expelled from the party for his support of Bukharin and the Right Opposition and for his theory of American exceptionalism, which held that capitalism was more secure in the United States and thus socialists should pursue different, more moderate strategies there than elsewhere in the world. That contradicted Stalin&#x27;s views and the new Third Period policy of ultra-leftism promoted by the Comintern. Lovestone and his friends had thought that they commanded the following of the mass of party members and, once expelled, optimistically named their new party the Communist Party (Majority Group). When the new group attracted only a few hundred members they changed its name to the Communist Party (Opposition). They were aligned with the International Communist Opposition, which had sections in fifteen countries. The CP(O) later became the &quot;Independent Communist Labor League&quot; and then, in 1938, the Independent Labor League of America, before dissolving in 1941. The party published the periodical &quot;Workers&#x27; Age&quot; (originally &quot;The Revolutionary Age&quot;), which was edited by Bertram Wolfe, along with a number of pamphlets.

===Union and anti-Communist activities===
In 1944, David Dubinsky arranged to place Lovestone in the AFL&#x27;s Free Trade Union Committee, where he worked out of the ILGWU&#x27;s headquarters. Along with Irving Brown he led the activities of the American Institute for Free Labor Development, an organization sponsored by the AFL which worked internationally, organizing free labor unions in Europe and Latin America which were not Communist-controlled. In connection with that work he cooperated closely with the CIA, feeding information about Communist labor-union activities to James Jesus Angleton, the CIA&#x27;s counterintelligence chief, in order to undermine Communist influence in the international union movement and provide intelligence to the US government. He remained there until 1963 when he became director of the AFL–CIO&#x27;s International Affairs Department (IAD), which quietly sent millions of dollars from the CIA to aid anti-communist activities internationally, particularly in Latin America.

In 1973, AFL–CIO president George Meany discovered that Lovestone was still in contact with Angleton of the CIA, who was conducting illegal domestic spying activities, despite being told seven years earlier to terminate this relationship. Meany chose to force Lovestone out by issuing an instruction with which he knew Lovestone would not comply. On March 6, 1974, he informed Lovestone that he wanted to close his New York office, stop publication of &quot;Free Trade Union News&quot;, and transfer Lovestone and his library and archives to Washington, D.C. When Lovestone argued he could not relocate his library of 6,000 books, he was dismissed, effective July 1. Lovestone&#x27;s successor, Ernie Lee, maintained a low profile during his tenure from 1974 through 1982 and significantly scaled back the AFL–CIO&#x27;s aggressive advocacy of a hawkish, anti-détente foreign policy.

===Death and legacy===
Lovestone died on March 7, 1990, at the age of 92. Lovestone&#x27;s massive accumulation of papers, today encompassing more than 865 archival boxes, were acquired by the Hoover Institution Archives at Stanford University in 1975, where they remained sealed for 20 years. The material was opened to the public in 1995 and was a source for author Ted Morgan, who published the first full-length biography of Lovestone in 1999. An associate, Louise Page Morris, later supplemented the collection with her correspondence—according to other reports, Morris &quot;spent 25 years as Lovestone&#x27;s lover.&quot; Lovestone&#x27;s Federal Bureau of Investigation file is reported to be 5,700 pages long.

<text>A financial intermediary is an institution or individual that serves as a &quot;middleman&quot; among diverse parties in order to facilitate financial transactions. Common types include commercial banks, investment banks, stockbrokers, insurance and pension funds, pooled investment funds, leasing companies, and stock exchanges.

The financial intermediary thus facilitates the indirect channeling of funds between, generically, lenders and borrowers. 
That is, savers (lenders) give funds to an intermediary institution (such as a bank), and that institution gives those funds to spenders (borrowers). 
When the money is lent directly - via the financial markets - eliminating the financial intermediary, this is known as financial disintermediation.

==Economic function==
Financial intermediaries, as outlined, essentially, channel funds from those who have surplus capital (savers) to those who require liquid funds to carry out a desired activity (investors). 

Financial intermediaries thus &quot;reallocate&quot; otherwise uninvested capital to productive enterprises.
In doing so, they offer the benefits of maturity and risk transformation. In other words, through the process of financial intermediation, assets or liabilities may be transformed into assets or liabilities with (very) different risk and payment profiles.
*In the personal finance context, the instrument in question will be in the form of a loan or a mortgage.
*In the corporate context, the form may be take any variety of debt, equity, or hybrid stakeholding structures, extending to private equity and venture capital investments. 
*Even in the non-commercial context of project finance, climate finance and development finance, financial intermediaries generally will be from the private sector.

The prevalence of these intermediaries, relative to disintermediated transactions, is explained in that specialist financial intermediaries ostensibly enjoy a cost advantage in offering financial services; this not only enables them to make profit, but also raises the overall efficiency of the economy. Their existence and services are then explained by the &quot;information problems&quot; associated with financial markets.

==Functions performed by financial intermediaries==
The hypothesis of financial intermediaries adopted by mainstream economics offers the following three major functions they are meant to perform:

# Creditors provide a line of credit to qualified clients and collect the premiums of debt instruments such as loans for financing homes, education, auto, credit cards, small businesses, and personal needs.
# Risk transformation
# Convenience denomination
# Commercial banks may provide safe storage for both cash as well as precious metals. 

==Advantages and disadvantages of financial intermediaries==

There are two essential advantages from using financial intermediaries:
# Cost advantage over direct lending/borrowing 
# Market failure protection; The conflicting needs of lenders and borrowers are reconciled, preventing market failure

The cost advantages of using financial intermediaries include:
#Reconciling conflicting preferences of lenders and borrowers
#Risk aversion intermediaries help spread out and decrease the risks
#Economies of scale - using financial intermediaries reduces the costs of lending and borrowing 
#Economies of scope - intermediaries concentrate on the demands of the lenders and borrowers and are able to enhance their products and services (use same inputs to produce different outputs)

Various disadvantages have also been noted in the context of climate finance and development finance institutions. These include a lack of transparency, inadequate attention to social and environmental concerns, and a failure to link directly to proven developmental impacts.

== Types of financial intermediaries ==
According to the dominant economic view of monetary operations, the following institutions are or can act as financial intermediaries:
* Banks
* Mutual savings banks
* Savings banks
* Building societies
* Credit unions
* Financial advisers or brokers
* Insurance companies
* Collective investment schemes
* Pension funds
* Cooperative societies
* Stock exchanges
According to the alternative view of monetary and banking operations, banks are not intermediaries but &quot;fundamentally money creation&quot; institutions, while the other institutions in the category of supposed &quot;intermediaries&quot; are simply investment funds.

<text>Svaneti (Svan: შუ̂ან, ლემშუ̂ანიერა shwan, lemshwaniera, Suania in ancient sources; ) is a historic province in the northwestern part of Georgia. Running along the Greater Caucasus range, Svaneti is one of the most mountainous regions of Georgia. It is largely inhabited by the Svans, an ethnic subgroup of Georgians.

== Geography ==
Situated on the southern slopes of the central Caucasus Mountains and surrounded by 3,000–5,000 meter peaks, Svaneti is the highest inhabited area in the Caucasus. Four of the 10 highest peaks of the Caucasus are located in the region. The highest mountain in Georgia, Mount Shkhara at 5,201 meters (17,059 feet), is located in the province. Prominent peaks include Tetnuldi (4,974 m / 16,319 ft), Shota Rustaveli (4,960 m / 16,273 ft), Mount Ushba (4,710 m / 15,453 ft), Ailama (4,525 m / 14,842 ft), as well as Lalveri, Latsga and others.

Svaneti has two parts corresponding to two inhabited valleys:
* Upper Svaneti (&quot;Zemo Svaneti&quot;) on the upper Inguri River; administratively part of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti; main town Mestia
* Lower Svaneti (&quot;Kvemo Svaneti&quot;) on the upper Tskhenistsqali River; administratively part of Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti; main town Lentekhi

They are separated by the Svaneti Range which is almost as high as the main Caucasus range. Historical Svaneti also included the Kodori Gorge in the adjoining rebel province of Abkhazia, and part of the adjacent river valleys of Kuban and Baksan north of the crest of the Caucasus. Writing in 1848, Bodenstedt said that Upper Svaneti could only be reached by a difficult footpath that was closed in winter.
===Landscape===

The landscape of Svaneti is dominated by mountains that are separated by deep gorges. Most of the region which lies below 1,800 meters (5,904  ft) above sea level is covered by mixed and coniferous forests. The forest zone is made up of tree species such as spruce, fir, beech, oak, and hornbeam. Other species that are less common but may still be found in some areas include chestnut, birch, maple, pine and box. The zone which extends from 1,800 meters to roughly about 3,000 meters (5,904–9,840  ft) above sea level consists of alpine meadows and grasslands. Eternal snows and glaciers take over in areas that are over 3,000 meters above sea level. The region is notable for its glaciers and picturesque summits. Svaneti&#x27;s signature peak is probably Mount Ushba which towers over the Inguri Gorge and can be seen from many parts of the region.

===Climate===

The climate of Svaneti is humid and is influenced by the air masses coming in from the Black Sea throughout the year. Average temperatures and precipitation vary considerably with elevation. Annual precipitation ranges between 1000 and 3200  mm (39 and 126 inches). The highest amount of precipitation falls on the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The region is characterized by very heavy snowfall in the winter and avalanches are a frequent occurrence. Snow cover may reach 5 meters (16.4 feet) in some areas. In general, the lowest regions of Svaneti (800–1200 meters / 2624–3936 feet above sea level) are characterized by long, warm summers and relatively cold and snowy winters. Middle altitudes (1200–1800 meters above sea level) experience relatively warm summers and cold winters. Areas above 2000 meters above sea level lie within a zone that experiences short, cool summers (less than 3 months) and long and cold winters. Large parts of Svaneti lie above 3000 meters (9840 feet) above sea level, a zone that does not have a real summer. Due to Svaneti&#x27;s close proximity to the Black Sea, the region is spared from the extremely cold winter temperatures that are characteristic of high mountains.

== History ==

The Svans are usually identified with the &quot;Soanes&quot; mentioned by Greek geographer Strabo, who placed them more or less in the area still occupied by the modern-day Svans. The province had been a dependency of Colchis, and of its successor kingdom of Lazica (Egrisi) until AD 552, when the Svans took advantage of the Lazic War, repudiated this connection and went over to the Persians. &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity&quot; notes that &quot;this seems to have reflected a general Suanian preference for the alliance to Persia, set against a Lazican preference for Roman alliance, which was to remain a point of tension until the Arab conquests&quot;. The Byzantines wanted the region, for if they secured its passes, they could prevent Persian raids on the border areas of Lazica. With the end of the war (562), Svanetia again became part of Lazica. Then, the province joined the Kingdom of Abkhazia (John and Adarnase of the Shavliani dynasty, 871–893) to form a unified monarchy which was incorporated into the Kingdom of Georgia in the early 11th century. Svanetia became a duchy (&quot;saeristavo&quot;) within it, governed by a duke (&quot;eristavi&quot;). The province&#x27;s Orthodox culture flourished particularly during the Georgian “golden age” under Queen Tamar (r. 1184–1213), who was respected almost as a goddess by the Svanetians. The legend has it that the duchy was annually visited by Tamar. The Svans had been known as fierce warriors for centuries. Their inflatable war banner was named &quot;Lemi&quot; (Lion) because of its shape.

The marauding Mongols never reached Svanetia and, for a time, the region became a cultural safe house. Following the final disintegration of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 1460s, fighting broke out for controlling the province. Part of Upper Svanetia formed an independent Principality of Svaneti under the Princes Dadeshkeliani, a branch of the Gelovani family, while Lower Svanetia, originally ruled by the Princes Gelovani, was temporarily usurped and subdued by the Mingrelian princes Dadiani. Facing serious internal conflict, Prince Tsioq’ Dadeshkeliani of Svanetia signed a treaty of protectorate with the Russian Empire on November 26, 1833. Difficult to access, the region retained significant autonomy until 1857, when Russia took advantage of the dynastic feud in Svanetia and effectively abolished the principality&#x27;s autonomy. In 1875, the Russians toughened their rule by imposing additional taxes. Protests ensued, and Russia deployed troops against the province. Despite having suffered heavy losses, the Russian army units eventually crushed the rebels burning their stronghold Khalde to the ground in 1876.

Part of the Russian governorate of Kutais, Svanetia was divided into two raions (districts) — Mestia (former Sethi) and Lentekhi — under the Soviet rule. The unsuccessful anti-Soviet Svaneti uprising took place in the region in 1921. 

In 1987, avalanches destroyed several homes and killed at least 80, many of them schoolchildren. In the aftermath the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed a decree to resettle some 2,500 families to districts of eastern Georgia (eco-migration to Marneuli, Tetritskaro, Bolnisi, Sagarejo, Gardabani, Dmanisi, Kaspi, Tskaltubo, Khoni, Ozurgeti, and Lanchkhuti rayons). The end of the Soviet Union and subsequent Georgian Civil War created severe socioeconomic problems in the region. While the Svanetian population resisted the unpleasant conditions of the high mountain environment they lived in for centuries, the increasing economic difficulties of the last two decades and frequent natural disasters — floods and landslides as of April 2005 () have brought about a strong tendency towards migration. The province became a safe haven for criminals threatening local residents and tourists. Large-scale anti-criminal operations carried out by the Georgian Special Forces as of March 2004 resulted in significant improvement of the situation.

== Population ==

The Svans, the indigenous population of Svanetia, are an ethnic subgroup of the Georgians. Until the 1930s, Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian thereafter. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th-6th centuries. However, some remnants of old paganism have been maintained. Saint George (known as &quot;Jgëræg&quot; to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including blood revenge. Their families are small, and the husband is the head of his family.

Typically bilingual, they use both Georgian and their own, unwritten Svan language, which together with the Georgian, Mingrelian, and Laz languages constitute the South Caucasian or Kartvelian language family.

== Culture and tourism ==
Svanetia is known for its architectural treasures and picturesque landscapes. The botany of Svanetia is legendary among travelers. The famous Svanetian tower houses, erected mainly in the 9th-12th centuries, make the region&#x27;s villages more attractive. With a high quantity of these unique houses and exceptional preservation of a medieval rural village, the community of Ushguli in Upper Svaneti was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.

Svan songs and dances are notable cultural traditions. Svanetia boasts arguably the most archaic three-part polyphonic singing. Most of their songs are connected to round dances, are performed very loudly and are full of dissonant chords.

<text>Hindu texts or Hindu scriptures are manuscripts and voluminous historical literature which are related to any of the diverse traditions within Hinduism. Some of the major Hindu texts include the Vedas, the Upanishads, and the Itihasa. Scholars hesitate in defining the term &quot;Hindu scriptures&quot; given the diverse nature of Hinduism, but many list the Agamas as Hindu scriptures, and Dominic Goodall includes Bhagavata Purana and Yajnavalkya Smriti in the list of Hindu scriptures as well.

==History==
There are two historic classifications of Hindu texts: &quot;Shruti&quot; (Sanskrit: श्रुति, ) – that which is heard, and &quot;Smriti&quot; (Sanskrit: स्मृति, IAST: &quot;Smṛti&quot;) – that which is remembered. The &quot;Shruti&quot; texts refer to the body of most authoritative and ancient religious texts, believed to be eternal knowledge authored neither by human nor divine agent but transmitted by sages (&quot;rishis&quot;). These comprise the central canon of Hinduism. It includes the four Vedas including its four types of embedded texts – the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the Upanishads. Of the &quot;Shrutis&quot;, the Upanishads alone are widely influential among Hindus, considered scriptures par excellence of Hinduism, and their central ideas have continued to influence its thoughts and traditions.

The &quot;Smriti&quot; texts are a specific body of Hindu texts attributed to an author, as a derivative work they are considered less authoritative than &quot;Shruti&quot; in Hinduism. The Smriti literature is a vast corpus of diverse texts, and includes but is not limited to Vedāngas, the Hindu epics (such as the Mahabharat and Ramayan), the Sutras and Shastras, the texts of Hindu philosophies, the Puranas, the Kāvya or poetical literature, the &quot;Bhasyas&quot;, and numerous &quot;Nibandhas&quot; (digests) covering politics, ethics, culture, arts and society.

Many ancient Hindu texts were composed in Sanskrit and other regional Indian languages. In modern times, most ancient texts have been translated into other Indian languages and some in non-Indian languages. Prior to the start of the common era, the Hindu texts were composed orally, then memorized and transmitted orally, from one generation to the next, for more than a millennium before they were written down into manuscripts. This verbal tradition of preserving and transmitting Hindu texts, from one generation to next, continued into the modern era.

== Shruti ==
The Shruti texts, defined as &quot;that which is heard&quot;, are texts that are believed to be divine revelations of God and were heard by ancient rishis thousands of years ago. Thus, an author is not attributed to these texts. The origin language of these texts is Sanskrit. The Vedas are considered Shruti texts. The Vedas consist of four parts: Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda. Each Veda is subcategorized into Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and Upanishads.

=== Vedas ===
The four Vedas (Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda) are a large body of Hindu texts originating from the Vedic period in northern India, the Rig Veda being composed , and its Samhita and Brahmanas complete before about 800 BCE. Composed in Vedic Sanskrit hymns, the texts constitute the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest scriptures of Hinduism. Hindus consider the Vedas to be timeless revelation, &quot;apauruṣeya&quot;, which means &quot;not of a man, superhuman&quot; and &quot;impersonal, authorless&quot;. The knowledge in the Vedas is believed in Hinduism to be eternal, uncreated, neither authored by human nor by divine source, but seen, heard and transmitted by sages.

Vedas are also called &quot;shruti&quot; (&quot;what is heard&quot;) literature, distinguishing them from other religious texts, which are called &quot;&quot; (&quot;what is remembered&quot;). The Vedas, for orthodox Indian theologians, are considered revelations, some way or other the work of the Deity. In the Hindu Epic the Mahabharata, the creation of Vedas is credited to the deity responsible for creation, Brahma.

Each of the four Vedas have been subclassified into four major text types:

# the Samhitas (mantras and benedictions), 
# the Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), 
# the Brahmanas (commentaries on rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices), and 
# the Upanishads (text discussing meditation, philosophy and spiritual knowledge).

=== Upanishads ===

The Upanishads are a collection of Hindu texts which contain the central philosophical concepts of Hinduism. The Upanishads are the foundation of Hindu philosophical thought and its diverse traditions.

The Upanishads are commonly referred to as &quot;Vedānta&quot;, interpreted to mean either the &quot;last chapters, parts of the Veda&quot; or &quot;the object, the highest purpose of the Veda&quot;. The concepts of Brahman (Ultimate Reality) and Ātman (Soul, Self) are central ideas in all the Upanishads, and &quot;Know your Ātman&quot; their thematic focus. The central ideas of the Upanishads have had a lasting influence on Hindu philosophy.

More than 200 Upanishads are known, of which ten are the oldest and most important and are referred to as the &quot;mukhya&quot; (main) or principal Upanishads. The ten mukhya Upanishads are: Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashna, Mundaka, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya, and Brihadaranyaka. The &quot;mukhya&quot; Upanishads are found mostly in the concluding part of the &quot;Brahmanas&quot; and &quot;Aranyakas&quot; and were, for centuries, memorized by each generation and passed down verbally. The early Upanishads all predate the Common Era, some in all likelihood pre-Buddhist (6th century BCE), down to the Maurya period. Of the remainder, some 95 Upanishads are part of the Muktika canon, composed from about the start of common era through medieval Hinduism. New Upanishads, beyond the 108 in the Muktika canon, continued being composed through the early modern and modern era, though often dealing with subjects unconnected to Hinduism.

==Smriti==
Smriti is the classification of literature which includes various scriptures and &quot;Itihasa&quot;s (epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata), Harivamsa Puranas, Agamas and Darshanas. This genre of texts includes the Sutras and Shastras of the six schools of Hindu philosophy: Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta.

The Sutras and Shastras texts were compilations of technical or specialized knowledge in a defined area. The earliest are dated to the latter half of the 1st millennium BCE. The Dharma-shastras (law books), derivatives of the Dharma-sutras. Other examples were &quot;bhautikashastra&quot; &quot;physics&quot;, &quot;rasayanashastra&quot; &quot;chemistry&quot;, &quot;jīvashastra&quot; &quot;biology&quot;, &quot;vastushastra&quot; &quot;architectural science&quot;, &quot;shilpashastra&quot; &quot;science of sculpture&quot;, &quot;arthashastra&quot; &quot;economics&quot; and &quot;nītishastra&quot; &quot;political science&quot;. It also includes Tantras and Agama literature.

=== Puranas ===

The Puranas, which mean &quot;history&quot; or &quot;old&quot;, are Sanskrit texts which were composed between 3rd century BCE and 1000 CE. The Puranas are a vast genre of Hindu texts that encyclopedically cover a wide range of topics, particularly legends and other traditional lore. Composed primarily in Sanskrit, but also in regional languages, several of these texts are named after major Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, and Devi.

The Puranic literature is encyclopedic, and it includes diverse topics such as cosmogony, cosmology, genealogies of gods, goddesses, kings, heroes, sages, and demigods, folk tales, pilgrimages, temples, medicine, astronomy, grammar, mineralogy, humor, love stories, as well as theology and philosophy. The content is diverse across the Puranas, and each Purana has survived in numerous manuscripts which are themselves voluminous and comprehensive. The Hindu Puranas are anonymous texts and likely the work of many authors over the centuries; in contrast, most Jaina Puranas can be dated and their authors assigned.

There are 18 &quot;Maha Puranas&quot; (Great Puranas): Agni Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Bhavishya Purana, Brahmanda Purana, Brahmavaivarta Purana, Garuda Purana, Kurma Purana, Linga Purana, Markandeya Purana, Naradiya Purana, Padma Purana, Shiva Purana, Skanda Purana, Vamana Purana, Varaha Purana, Vayu Purana, and Vishnu Purana and 18 &quot;Upa Puranas&quot; (Minor Puranas), with over 400,000 verses. The Puranas do not enjoy the authority of a scripture in Hinduism, but are considered a Smriti. These Hindu texts have been influential in the Hindu culture, inspiring major national and regional annual festivals of Hinduism. The Bhagavata Purana has been among the most celebrated and popular text in the Puranic genre. The Bhagavata Purana emphasizes bhakti (devotion) towards Krishna. The Bhagavata Purana is a key text in Krishna bhakti literature.

=== Mahabharata ===
The &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, which translates to &quot;The Great Indian Tale&quot;, was probably compiled between the 3rd century BCE and the 3rd century CE, with the oldest preserved parts not much older than around 400 BCE. The text probably reached its final form by the early Gupta period (). The composition is traditionally attributed to Vedavyasa and is made up of over 100,000 shlokas.

The plot of the Mahabharata covers the events of the war between two groups of cousins (the Pandavas and the Kauravas) and the aftermath of the Kurukshetra War. The Mahabharata also teaches about dharma (duty), the stories of many key figures in Hinduism, and includes the Bhagavad Gita.

The Bhagavad Gita is made up of 700 shlokas and is the discussion between Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield before the start of the war. Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita teaches Arjuna about atma (soul), God, moksha, and dharma.

=== Ramayana ===
The Ramayana, an ancient Sanskrit text with the earliest part believed to have been composed in the 5th century BCE, is attributed to the sage Valmiki and contains over 24,000 verses.

The epic covers the life journey of Rama, an incarnation of Vishnu, along with his wife Sita, and brother Lakshmana. Central to the plot is the fourteen-year exile endured by Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana, during which Sita is abducted by Ravana of Lanka. Rama, accompanied by Lakshmana, Hanuman (a devotee of Rama), and an army, engages in a battle with Ravana, ultimately emerging victorious with Rama&#x27;s slaying of Ravana. The epic concludes with Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana&#x27;s return to Ayodhya, where Rama is crowned king and reigns over Ayodhya.

==Other Hindu texts==
Hindu texts for specific fields, in Sanskrit and other regional languages, have been reviewed as follows:
==Historical significance==
The Hindu scriptures provide the early documented history of arts and science forms in India such as music, dance, sculptures, architecture, astronomy, science, mathematics, medicine and wellness. Valmiki&#x27;s Ramayana (500 BCE to 100 BCE) mentions music and singing by Gandharvas, dance by Apsaras such as Urvashi, Rambha, Menaka, Tilottama Panchāpsaras, and by Ravana&#x27;s wives who excelling in &quot;nrityageeta&quot; or &quot;singing and dancing&quot; and &quot;nritavaditra&quot; or &quot;playing musical instruments&quot;). The evidence of earliest dance related texts are in &quot;Natasutras&quot;, which are mentioned in the text of Panini, the sage who wrote the classic on Sanskrit grammar, and who is dated to about 500 BCE. This performance arts related Sutra text is mentioned in other late Vedic texts, as are two scholars names Shilalin (IAST: Śilālin) and Krishashva (Kṛśaśva), credited to be pioneers in the studies of ancient drama, singing, dance and Sanskrit compositions for these arts. Richmond et al. estimate the &quot;Natasutras&quot; to have been composed around 600 BCE, whose complete manuscript has not survived into the modern age.

<text>The Borroughs Corporation is an American manufacturer of shelving and office fixtures. The corporate headquarters is in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Borroughs was established in 1938 under the name Probar Company. The company began as a contract fabricator, producing saw cabinets. It soon branched out and began producing fluorescent strip lighting fixtures as well as continuing contract work for automotive accessory firms. In 1939, the founder, Walter L. Borroughs, changed the name to Borroughs Manufacturing Company.

During World War II, Borroughs was subcontracted to manufacture various military components, such as land tank components, gun turret components, air scoops for aircraft, and water baffles for amphibious landing craft.

After the war, the company manufactured automotive bins. American Metal Products Company purchased the company in 1950, following Mr. Borroughs&#x27; death in 1948. Under the new management, Borroughs began to produce office furniture, industrial shelving, and storage units.

When American Metal Products merged with Lear Siegler, Inc. in 1966, Borroughs became a separate division of the new corporation.

In 1987, Forstmann Little purchased Lear Siegler; in 1991, some of Borroughs&#x27; managers and partial owners in Kalamazoo purchased the company from Forstmann Little. In the 1990s, the company&#x27;s products included checkstands and other retail fixtures. The Borroughs Series 90 conveyor belt system became widely used after many Pathmark supermarkets began installing them. At one time, Borroughs checkstands were in use at many Wal-Mart stores as well.

<doc id="593152" wikidata="Q3315112" url="?curid=593152" title="Minister for Defence (Australia)">
<text>The Minister for Defence is the minister of state of the Commonwealth of Australia charged with overseeing the organisation, implementation, and formulation of strategic policy in defence and military matters as the head of the Department of Defence. The Minister for Defence is responsible for the Australian Defence Organisation and the Australian Defence Force (ADF). The current Defence minister is Richard Marles, who is also concurrently serving as deputy prime minister of Australia, having been selected by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in May 2022 following the 2022 Australian federal election.

As the Minister for Defence is responsible for the management of Australia&#x27;s defence and military forces and the portfolio&#x27;s accountability to the Parliament, the secretary of Defence is required under section 63(1) of the &quot;Public Service Act 1999&quot; and the &quot;Requirements for Annual Reports&quot; from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Public Accounts and Audit to submit a report to the responsible ministers on the activities of the Department of Defence after the end of each financial year for presentation to the Parliament.

It is one of only four ministerial positions (along with prime minister, attorney-general and treasurer) that have existed since Federation.

==Defence policy==
The Defence minister is primarily responsible for implementing government defence policy. The three main entities responsible for formulating defence policy within Defence are the Air Power Development Centre, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and Sea Power Centre - Australia. Additionally, the minister releases white papers, that assess Australia&#x27;s current defence capabilities and set out areas of reform.

The most recent white paper publication is the &quot;2016 Defence White Paper&quot; that includes three elements: the 2016 Defence White Paper itself, &quot;2016 Integrated Investment Program&quot;, and &quot;2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement&quot;. It is the eighth defence white paper since 1976.

==Composition of the defence portfolio==
Over the years there have been a number of ministers with a variety of functions involved in the defence portfolio; in the period November 1939 to April 1942, there was no position named &quot;Minister of Defence&quot;. Instead, several ministers were responsible for the various tasks and duties that are presently under the purview of the minister for Defence.

Previous governments have included ministers with titles using one or more of the following terms:

*Air
*Aircraft production
*Army
*Defence
*Defence Coordination
*Defence Industry
*Defence Materiel
*Defence Personnel
*Defence Production
*Defence Science
*Defence Support
*Development
*Munitions
*Navy
*Repatriation
*Shipping
*Supply
*Veterans&#x27; Affairs
==List of ministers for defence==
There was a Minister for Defence from 1 January 1901 until 13 November 1939, with the exception of two small breaks. Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister, abolished the position on the outbreak of World War II and created separate Ministers for the Navy, the Army and the Air, with himself as Minister for Defence Coordination in his first ministry. He retained this position until the fall of his government, and then held the post in the brief government of Arthur Fadden. John Curtin initially followed the same arrangement as Menzies in his ministry until 14 April 1942, when he took the title of Minister for Defence. The separate titles of Ministers for the Navy, the Army and the Air were abolished in the second Whitlam Ministry on 30 November 1973, when the separate departments of Navy, Army and Air were also abolished. There had also been a separate Navy portfolio between 1915 and 1921.

<doc id="593155" wikidata="Q2289022" url="?curid=593155" title="Federal Open Market Committee">
<text>The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is a committee within the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) that is charged under United States law with overseeing the nation&#x27;s open market operations (e.g., the Fed&#x27;s buying and selling of United States Treasury securities). This Federal Reserve committee makes key decisions about interest rates and the growth of the United States money supply. Under the terms of the original Federal Reserve Act, each of the Federal Reserve banks were authorized to buy and sell in the open market bonds and short term obligations of the United States Government, bank acceptances, cable transfers, and bills of exchange. Hence, the reserve banks were at times bidding against each other in the open market. In 1922, an informal committee was established to execute purchases and sales. The Banking Act of 1933 formed an official FOMC.

The FOMC is the principal organ of United States national monetary policy. The Committee sets monetary policy by specifying the short-term objective for the Fed&#x27;s open market operations, which is usually a target level for the federal funds rate (the rate that commercial banks charge between themselves for overnight loans).

The FOMC also directs operations undertaken by the Federal Reserve System in foreign exchange markets, although any intervention in foreign exchange markets is coordinated with the U.S. Treasury, which has responsibility for formulating U.S. policies regarding the exchange value of the dollar.

== Membership ==
The Committee consists of the seven members of the Federal Reserve Board, the president of the New York Fed, and four of the other eleven regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, serving one-year terms. The Chair of the Federal Reserve has been invariably appointed by the committee as its chair since 1935, solidifying the perception of the two roles as one.

The Federal Open Market Committee was formed by the Banking Act of 1933 (codified at ) and did not include voting rights for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The Banking Act of 1935 revised these protocols to include the Board of Governors and to closely resemble the present-day FOMC and was amended in 1942 to give the current structure of twelve voting members.

Four of the Federal Reserve Bank presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating basis. The rotating seats are filled from the following four groups of banks, one bank president from each group: Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond; Cleveland and Chicago; Atlanta, St. Louis, and Dallas; and Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. The New York President always has a voting membership.

All of the Reserve Bank presidents, even those who are not currently voting members of the FOMC, attend Committee meetings, participate in discussions, and contribute to the Committee&#x27;s assessment of the economy and policy options. The Committee meets eight times a year, approximately once every six weeks.

== Meetings ==

By law, the FOMC must meet at least four times each year in Washington, D.C. Since 1981, eight regularly scheduled meetings have been held each year at intervals of five to eight weeks. If circumstances require consultation or consideration of an action between these regular meetings, members may be called on to participate in a special meeting or a telephone conference, or to vote on a proposed action by proxy. At each regularly scheduled meeting, the Committee votes on the policy to be carried out during the interval between meetings.

Attendance at meetings is restricted because of the confidential nature of the information discussed and is limited to Committee members, nonmember Reserve Bank presidents, staff officers, the Manager of the System Open Market Account, and a small number of Board and Reserve Bank staff.

== Decision-making process ==
Before each regularly scheduled meeting of the FOMC, System staff prepare written reports on past and prospective economic and financial developments that are sent to Committee members and to nonmember Reserve Bank presidents. Reports prepared by the Manager of the System Open Market Account on operations in the domestic open market and in foreign currencies since the last regular meeting are also distributed. At the meeting itself, staff officers present oral reports on the current and prospective business situation, on conditions in financial markets, and on international financial developments.

In its discussions, the Committee considers factors such as trends in prices and wages, employment and production, consumer income and spending, residential and commercial construction, business investment and inventories, foreign exchange markets, interest rates, money and credit aggregates, and fiscal policy. The Manager of the System Open Market Account also reports on account transactions since the previous meeting.

After these reports, the Committee members and other Reserve Bank presidents turn to policy. Typically, each participant expresses their own views on the state of the economy and prospects for the future and on the appropriate direction for monetary policy. Then each makes a more explicit recommendation on policy for the coming intermeeting period (and for the longer run, if under consideration).

== Consensus ==
Finally, the Committee must reach a consensus regarding the appropriate course for policy, which is incorporated in a directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York—the Bank that executes transactions for the System Open Market Account. The directive is cast in terms designed to provide guidance to the Manager in the conduct of day-to-day open market operations. The directive sets forth the Committee&#x27;s objectives for long-run growth of certain key monetary and credit aggregates.

It also sets forth operating guidelines for the degree of ease or restraint to be sought in reserve conditions and expectations with regard to short-term rates of growth in the monetary aggregates. Policy is implemented with emphasis on supplying reserves in a manner consistent with these objectives and with the nation&#x27;s broader economic objectives.

==Congressional oversight==
Under the Federal Reserve Act, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System must appear before Congressional hearings at least twice per year regarding &quot;the efforts, activities, objectives and plans of the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee with respect to the conduct of monetary policy&quot;. The statute requires that the Chairman appear before the House Committee on Financial Services in February and July of odd-numbered years, and before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in February and July of even-numbered years.

There is a very strong consensus against basing selection of committee members primarily on the candidate&#x27;s political views.

==Interest rate targeting==
The committee&#x27;s practice of interest rate targeting has been criticized by some commentators who argue that it may risk an inflationary bias.

Possible alternative rules that enjoy some support among economists include the traditional monetarist formula of targeting stable growth in an appropriately chosen monetary aggregate, and inflation targeting, now practiced by many central banks. Under inflationary pressure in 1979, the Fed temporarily abandoned interest rate targeting in favor of targeting non-borrowed reserves. It concluded, however, that this approach led to increased volatility in interest rates and monetary growth, and reversed itself in 1982.

Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke sympathetically as a Governor in 2003 of the inflation targeting approach. He explained that even a central bank like the Fed, which does not orient its monetary policies around an explicit, published inflation target, nonetheless takes account of its goal of low and stable inflation in formulating its interest rate targets. Bernanke summed up his overall assessment of inflation targeting as follows:

In keeping with his 2003 speech as Governor, Bernanke as Chairman attempted to promote greater transparency in Fed communications. The Fed now publicly indicates the range within which it would like to see future inflation.

<doc id="593159" wikidata="Q264924" url="?curid=593159" title="Sada Abe">
<text>was a Japanese geisha and prostitute who murdered her lover, , via strangulation on May 18, 1936, before cutting off his penis and testicles and carrying them around with her in her kimono. The story became a national sensation in Japan, acquiring mythic overtones; it has also been interpreted by artists, philosophers, novelists and filmmakers. Abe was released after serving five years in prison and went on to write an autobiography.

==Family background==
Sada Abe was the seventh of eight children of Shigeyoshi and Katsu Abe, an upper middle-class family of tatami mat makers in Tokyo&#x27;s Kanda neighborhood. Only four of the Abe children survived to adulthood, and of those Sada was the youngest. Sada&#x27;s father, originally from Chiba Prefecture, had been adopted into the Abe family to help with the business, which he eventually inherited. Aged 52 at the time of Sada&#x27;s birth, Shigeyoshi Abe was described by police as &quot;an honest and upright man&quot; who had neither conspicuous vices nor any brushes with the law; some acquaintances reported him to be somewhat self-centered, with a taste for extravagance. Likewise, Sada&#x27;s mother had no known legal or moral blemishes on her record.

Sada&#x27;s brother Shintarō was known as a womanizer, and, after his marriage, ran away with his parents&#x27; money. Her sister Teruko was also known to have had several lovers. Sada&#x27;s father sent Teruko to work in a brothel, then not an uncommon way to punish female sexual promiscuity in Japan, although he soon bought her back. Teruko&#x27;s past was not considered a hindrance to marriage for those of the Abes&#x27; class at the time, and she soon married.

==Early life==
Abe was born in 1905. Her mother doted on Sada, who was her youngest surviving child, and allowed her to do as she wished. She encouraged Abe to take lessons in singing and in playing the , both activities which, at the time, were more closely associated with geisha – an occasionally low-class profession – and prostitutes than with classical artistic endeavor. Geisha were considered glamorous celebrities at the time, and Abe herself pursued this image by skipping school for her music lessons and wearing stylish make-up.

As family problems over her siblings Teruko and Shintarō became more pressing, Abe was often sent out of the house alone. She soon fell in with a group of similarly independent teenagers. At the age of 14, during one of her outings with this group, Abe was raped by one of her acquaintances, a Keio University student. Abe&#x27;s parents initially appeared to support her, but soon changed their response, and, claiming that Abe had become irresponsible and uncontrollable, they sold her to a geisha house in Yokohama in 1922. Abe&#x27;s oldest sister, Toku, testified that she wished to become a geisha. Abe herself, however, claimed that her father made her a geisha as punishment for her promiscuity.

Abe&#x27;s encounter with the geisha world proved to be a frustrating and disappointing one. To become a true star among geisha required apprenticeship from childhood, with years spent training and studying arts and music. Abe never progressed beyond a low rank, and one of her main duties was to provide sex for clients. She worked for five years in this capacity and eventually contracted syphilis. Since this meant she would be required to undergo regular physical examinations, just as a legally licensed prostitute would, Abe decided to enter a better-paying profession.

==Early 1930s==

Abe began work as a prostitute in Osaka&#x27;s famous Tobita brothel district, but soon gained a reputation as a trouble-maker. She stole money from clients and attempted to leave the brothel several times, but was soon tracked down by the well-organized legal prostitution system. After two years, Abe eventually succeeded in escaping and took a job as a waitress. However, not satisfied with the wages, she returned to prostitution, though now unlicensed, and began working in the unlicensed brothels of Osaka in 1932. After the death of her mother in January 1933, Abe traveled to Tokyo to visit her father, and her mother&#x27;s grave. She entered into the prostitution market in Tokyo and while there became a mistress for the first time. When her father became gravely ill in January 1934, Abe nursed him for ten days until his death.

In October 1934, Abe was arrested in a police raid on the unlicensed brothel at which she was working at the time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. Kasahara was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe&#x27;s agreement, made her his mistress. He set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, &quot;She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn&#x27;t satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on her private parts all night long… At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted.&quot; When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and, to escape him, Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe: &quot;She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear.&quot; Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, &quot;He didn&#x27;t love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up.&quot;

In Nagoya, in 1935, again intending to leave the sex industry, Abe began working as a maid at a restaurant. She soon became romantically involved with a customer at the restaurant, Gorō Ōmiya, a professor and banker who aspired to become a member of the Diet of Japan. Knowing that the restaurant would not tolerate a maid having sexual relations with clients, and having become bored with Nagoya, she returned to Tokyo in June. Ōmiya met Abe in Tokyo and, finding that she had previously contracted syphilis, paid for her stay at a hot springs resort in Kusatsu from November until January 1936. In January, Ōmiya suggested that Abe could become financially independent by opening a small restaurant and recommended that she should start working as an apprentice in the restaurant business.

==Acquaintance with Kichizō Ishida==
Back in Tokyo, Abe began work as an apprentice at the Yoshidaya restaurant on February 1, 1936. The owner of this establishment, Kichizō Ishida, 42 at the time, had worked his way up in the business, starting as an apprentice at a restaurant specializing in eel dishes. He had opened Yoshidaya in Tokyo&#x27;s Nakano neighborhood in 1920. When Abe joined his restaurant, Ishida had become known as a womanizer who, by that time, did little in the way of actually running the restaurant, which had become, in fact, managed primarily by his wife.

Not long after Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous advances towards her. Ōmiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, and she was responsive to Ishida&#x27;s approaches. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant to the accompaniment of a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant&#x27;s geisha. On April 23, 1936, Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or —the contemporary equivalent of a love hotel—in the Shibuya neighborhood. Planning only for a short fling, the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of Futako Tamagawa where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha&#x27;s singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve sake. They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood. Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, after an absence of about two weeks. Of Ishida, Abe later said, &quot;It is hard to say exactly what was so good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man.&quot;

After their two-week encounter ended, Abe became agitated and began drinking excessively. She said that with Ishida she had come to know true love for the first time in her life, and the thought of Ishida being back with his wife made her intensely jealous. Just over a week before Ishida&#x27;s eventual death, Abe began to contemplate his murder. On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacked her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night: &quot;I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, &#x27;Kichi, you wore that kimono just to please one of your favorite customers. You bastard, I&#x27;ll kill you for that.&#x27; Ishida was startled and drew away a little, but he seemed delighted with it all…&quot;

==Murder of Ishida==
Ishida and Abe returned to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife to the base of Ishida&#x27;s penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure (erotic asphyxiation). She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi to cut off Ishida&#x27;s breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida&#x27;s face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took thirty tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, &quot;You&#x27;ll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I&#x27;m sleeping, won&#x27;t you… If you start to strangle me, don&#x27;t stop, because it is so painful afterwards.&quot; Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.

At about 2 a.m. on May 18, 1936, while Ishida was asleep, Abe wrapped her sash twice around his neck and strangled him to death. She later told police, &quot;After I had killed Ishida I felt totally at ease, as though a heavy burden had been lifted from my shoulders, and I felt a sense of clarity.&quot; After lying with Ishida&#x27;s body for a few hours, she next severed his penis and testicles with the kitchen knife, wrapped them in a magazine cover, and kept them until her arrest three days later. With the blood she wrote on Ishida&#x27;s left thigh, and on a bed sheet. She then carved (&quot;Sada&quot;, the character for her name) into his left arm. After putting on Ishida&#x27;s underwear, she left the inn at about 8 am, telling the staff not to disturb Ishida.

After leaving the inn, Abe met her former lover Gorō Ōmiya. She repeatedly apologized to him, but Ōmiya, unaware of the murder, assumed that she was apologizing for having taken another lover. In actuality, Abe&#x27;s apologies were for the damage to his political career that she knew his association with her was bound to cause. After Ishida&#x27;s body was discovered, a search was launched for Abe, who had gone missing. On May 19, 1936, the newspapers picked up the story. Ōmiya&#x27;s career was ruined, and Abe&#x27;s life was under intense public scrutiny from that point onwards.

==Abe Sada panic==
The circumstances of Ishida&#x27;s death immediately caused a national sensation. The ensuing frenzy over the search for Abe was called &quot;Abe Sada panic&quot;. Police received reports of sightings of Abe from various cities, and one false sighting nearly caused a stampede in the Ginza, resulting in a large traffic jam. In a reference to the recent failed coup in Tokyo, the February 26 Incident or &quot; Incident&quot; (&quot;2–26&quot; or &quot;February 26&quot;), the crime was satirically dubbed &quot;the Go Ichi-Hachi Incident&quot; (&quot;5–18&quot; or &quot;May 18&quot;).

On May 19, 1936, Abe went shopping and saw a movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in Shinagawa on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Ōmiya, a friend, and Ishida. Abe planned to commit suicide one week after the murder, and practiced necrophilia. &quot;I felt attached to Ishida&#x27;s penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them and gazed at his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me… It didn&#x27;t work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, I decided that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida&#x27;s penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on Mount Ikoma while holding on to his penis.&quot;

At 4:00 in the afternoon, police detectives, suspicious of the alias under which Abe had registered, came to her room. &quot;Don&#x27;t be so formal,&quot; she told them. &quot;You&#x27;re looking for Sada Abe, right? Well, that&#x27;s me. I am Sada Abe.&quot; When the police were not convinced, she displayed Ishida&#x27;s genitalia as proof.

Abe was arrested and interrogated over eight sessions. When asked why she had severed Ishida&#x27;s genitalia, Abe replied, &quot;Because I couldn&#x27;t take his head or body with me. I wanted to take the part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories.&quot; The interrogating officer was struck by Abe&#x27;s demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. &quot;Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way.&quot; Her answer was: &quot;I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, as long as he lived, he could be embraced by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him…&quot; In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe&#x27;s case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan, William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation: &quot;She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love.&quot; Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe Incident occurred at a time when the Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the Incident and a looming war in China. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time. The case also struck a chord with the (&quot;erotic-grotesque-nonsense&quot;) style popular at the time, and the case came to represent that genre for years to come.

When the details of the crime were made public, rumors began to circulate that Ishida&#x27;s penis was of extraordinary size; however, the police officer who interrogated Abe after her arrest denied this, saying, &quot;Ishida&#x27;s was just average. [Abe] told me, &#x27;Size doesn&#x27;t make a man in bed. Technique and his desire to please me were what I liked about Ishida. After her arrest, Ishida&#x27;s penis and testicles were moved to Tokyo University Medical School&#x27;s pathology museum. They were put on public display soon after the end of World War II, but have since disappeared.

==Conviction and sentencing==
The first day of Abe&#x27;s trial was November 25, 1936; by 5 a.m., crowds were already gathering to attend. The judge presiding over the trial admitted to being sexually aroused by some of the details involved in the case yet made sure that the trial was held with the utmost seriousness. Abe&#x27;s statement before receiving sentencing began, &quot;The thing I regret most about this incident is that I have come to be misunderstood as some kind of sexual pervert… There had never been a man in my life like Ishida. There were men I liked, and with whom I slept without accepting money, but none made me feel the way I did toward him.&quot;

On December 21, 1936, Abe was convicted of murder and mutilation of a corpse. Though the prosecution demanded ten years, and Abe claimed that she desired the death penalty, she was in fact sentenced to just six years in prison. Abe was confined in Tochigi women&#x27;s penitentiary, where she was prisoner No. 11. Her sentence was commuted on November 10, 1940, on the occasion of the 2,600th anniversary celebrations of the mythical founding of Japan, when Emperor Jimmu came to the throne. Abe was released exactly five years after the murder, on May 17, 1941.

The police record of Abe&#x27;s interrogation and confession became a national best-seller in 1936. Christine L. Marran puts the national fascination with Abe&#x27;s story within the context of the or &quot;poison woman&quot; stereotype, a transgressive female character type that had first become popular in Japanese serialized novels and stage works in the 1870s. In the wake of popular &quot;poison woman&quot; literature, confessional autobiographies by female criminals had begun appearing in the late 1890s. By the early 1910s, autobiographical writings by criminal women took on an unapologetic tone and sometimes included criticisms of Japan and Japanese society. Kanno Suga, who was hanged in 1911 for conspiring to assassinate Emperor Meiji in what was known as the High Treason Incident, wrote openly rebellious essays while in prison. Kaneko Fumiko, who was sentenced to death for plotting to bomb the imperial family, used her notoriety to speak against the imperial system and the racism and paternalism that she said it engendered. Abe&#x27;s confession, in the years since its appearance, became the most circulated female criminal narrative in Japan. Marran points out that Abe, unlike previous criminal autobiographers, stressed her sexuality and the love she felt for her victim.

==Later life==
Upon release from prison, Abe assumed an alias. As the mistress of a &quot;serious man&quot;, she referred to in her memoirs as &quot;Y&quot;, she moved first to Ibaraki Prefecture and then to Saitama Prefecture. When Abe&#x27;s true identity became known to Y&#x27;s friends and family, she broke off their relationship.

In the aftermath of World War II, wishing to divert public attention from politics and criticism of the occupying authorities, the Yoshida government encouraged a &quot;3-S&quot; policy—&quot;sports, screen, and sex&quot;. Pre-war writings, such as &quot;The Psychological Diagnosis of Abe Sada&quot; (1937) depict Abe as an example of the dangers of unbridled female sexuality and as a threat to the patriarchal system. In the postwar era, she was treated as a critic of totalitarianism, and a symbol of freedom from oppressive political ideologies. Abe became a popular subject in literature of both high and low quality. The writer Sakunosuke Oda wrote two stories based on Abe, and a June 1949 article noted that Abe had recently tried to clear her name after it had been used in a &quot;mountain&quot; of erotic books.

In 1946, the writer Ango Sakaguchi interviewed Abe, treating her as an authority on both sexuality and freedom. He called Abe a &quot;tender, warm figure of salvation for future generations.&quot; In 1947, Ichiro Kimura&#x27;s &quot;The Erotic Confessions of Abe Sada&quot; became a national bestseller, with over 100,000 copies sold. The book was in the form of an interview with Abe, but was actually based on the police interrogation records. As a response to this book, Abe wrote her own autobiography, &quot;Memoirs of Abe Sada&quot;, which was published in 1948. In contrast to Kimura&#x27;s depiction of her as a pervert, she stressed her love for Ishida. The first edition of the magazine , in January 1948, featured previously unpublished photos of the incident with the headline &quot;Ero-guro of the Century! First Public Release. Pictorial of the Abe Sada Incident.&quot; Reflecting the change in tone in writings on Abe, the June 1949 issue of &quot;Monthly Reader&quot; called her a &quot;Heroine of That Time&quot; for following her own desires in a time of &quot;false morality&quot; and oppression.

Abe capitalized on her notoriety by sitting for an interview in a popular magazine, and appearing for several years starting in 1947 in a traveling one-act stage production called (&quot;A Woman of the Shōwa Period&quot;) under the direction of dramatist Nagata Mikihiko. In 1952 she began working at the Hoshikikusui, a working-class pub in Inari-chō in downtown Tokyo. Abe lived a low-profile life in Tokyo&#x27;s Shitaya neighborhood for the next 20 years, and her neighborhood restaurant association gave her a &quot;model employee&quot; award. More than once, during the 1960s, film-critic Donald Richie visited the Hoshikikusui. In his collection of profiles, &quot;Japanese Portraits&quot;, he describes Abe making a dramatic entrance into a boisterous group of drinkers. She would slowly descend a long staircase that led into the middle of the crowd, fixing a haughty gaze on individuals in her audience. The men in the pub would respond by putting their hands over their crotches, and shouting out things like, &quot;Hide the knives!&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m afraid to go and pee!&quot; Abe would slap the banister in anger and stare the crowd into an uncomfortable and complete silence, and only then continue her entrance, chatting and pouring drinks from table to table. Richie comments, &quot;…she had actually choked a man to death and then cut off his member. It was a consequent frisson when Sada Abe slapped your back.&quot;

In 1969, Abe appeared in the &quot;Sada Abe Incident&quot; section of director Teruo Ishii&#x27;s dramatized documentary , and the last known photograph of Abe was taken in August of that year.

Abe disappeared from the public eye in 1970. When the film &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot; was being planned in the mid-1970s, director Nagisa Ōshima apparently sought out Abe and, after a long search, found her, her hair shorn, in a nunnery in Kansai. According to Kagero Mutsuki, around 1992, the cannibal murderer Issei Sagawa somehow tracked down Abe to a nursing home in Izu City, Shizuoka Prefecture.

==Legacy==
Decades after both the incident and her disappearance, Abe continues to draw public interest:
* Mutsuo Toi took an interest in Abe&#x27;s case and started writing a novel, . In 1938, two years after Abe&#x27;s crime, Toi perpetrated the deadliest single-shooter massacre in Japanese history before killing himself.
* In addition to the documentary in which Abe herself appeared shortly before she disappeared from the public eye, and the 1976 Japanese-language &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot;, at least three successful films have been made based on the story. The 1983 film, &quot;Sexy Doll: Abe Sada Sansei&quot;, made use of Abe&#x27;s name in the title. In 1998, a 438-page biography of Abe was published in Japan, and the first full-length book on Abe in English, William Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Geisha, Harlot, Strangler, Star: A Woman, Sex, and Morality in Modern Japan&quot;, was published in 2005.
* Japanese Noise musician Merzbow adopted the alias Abe Sada for an early musical project. He released only one record under this name, the 1994 7&quot; &quot;Original Body Kingdom/Gala Abe Sada 1936&quot;.
* In March 2007, a four-bass noise band from Perth, Australia, named Abe Sada won a Contemporary Music Grant from the Australian Department of Culture and the Arts to tour Japan in June and July 2007.

==Pretrial Interrogation Transcript==
*Pretrial Interrogation Transcript - Undisclosed court documents were transcribed (or photographed) by someone and leaked to the outside. From his upbringing, he wrote about the situation before and after the crime, and it was published underground as &quot;Glossy Record&quot;. It is a first-class document related to the Abe Sada case..

* 1976 – Nagisa Oshima&#x27;s &quot;In the Realm of the Senses&quot; which was widely banned following its release, for explicit scenes of sex and nudity.
* 1998 – Nobuhiko Obayashi&#x27;s &quot;Sada&quot; starring Hitomi Kuroki.
* 1999 – Sachi Hamano&#x27;s

<text>The New York World was a newspaper published in New York City from 1860 to 1931. The paper played a major role in the history of American newspapers as a leading national voice of the Democratic Party. From 1883 to 1911 under publisher Joseph Pulitzer, it was a pioneer in yellow journalism, capturing readers&#x27; attention with sensation, sports, sex and scandal and pushing its daily circulation to the one-million mark. It was sold in 1931 and merged into the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;.

== History ==
===Early years===
The &quot;World&quot; was founded in 1860. From 1862 to 1876, it was edited by Manton Marble, who was also its proprietor. During the 1864 United States presidential election, the &quot;World&quot; was shut down for three days after it published from Abraham Lincoln. Marble, disgusted by the defeat of Samuel Tilden in the 1876 presidential election, sold the paper after the election to a group headed by Thomas A. Scott, the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, who used the paper &quot;as a propaganda vehicle for his stock enterprises.&quot; But Scott was unable to meet the newspaper&#x27;s growing losses, and in 1879 he sold it to financier Jay Gould as part of a deal that also included the Texas &amp; Pacific Railroad. Gould, like Scott, used the paper for his own purposes, employing it to help him take over Western Union. But Gould, like Scott, could not turn the financial state of the newspaper around, and by the 1880s, it was losing $40,000 a year.

===Joseph Pulitzer years===
Joseph Pulitzer bought the &quot;World&quot; in 1883 and began an aggressive era of circulation building. Reporter Nellie Bly became one of America&#x27;s first investigative journalists, often working undercover. As a publicity stunt for the paper, inspired by the Jules Verne novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, she traveled around the planet in 72 days in 1889–1890. In 1890, Pulitzer built the &quot;New York World&quot; Building, the tallest office building in the world at the time.

In 1889, Julius Chambers was appointed by Pulitzer as managing editor of the &quot;New York World;&quot; he served until 1891. In 1890, Pulitzer, Chambers, et al. were indicted for posthumous criminal libel against Alexander T. Stewart for accusing him of &quot;a dark and secret crime&quot;, as the man who &quot;invited guests to meet his mistresses at his table&quot;, and as &quot;a pirate of the dry goods ocean.&quot; The charges were dismissed by the court. This sort of criminal action was common at the time and both Pulitzer and Chambers were indicted in a number of cases, in some of which they were acquitted, in others convicted.
In 1896, the &quot;World&quot; began using a four-color printing press; it was the first newspaper to launch a color supplement, which featured &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; cartoon &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;. It joined a circulation battle with William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot;. In 1899 Pulitzer and Hearst were the cause of the newsboys&#x27; strike of 1899, which led to Pulitzer&#x27;s circulation dropping by 70%.

The &quot;World&quot; was attacked for being &quot;sensational&quot;, and its circulation battles with Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; gave rise to the term yellow journalism. The charges of sensationalism were most frequently leveled at the paper by more established publishers, who resented Pulitzer&#x27;s courting of the immigrant classes. And while the &quot;World&quot; presented its fair share of crime stories, it also published damning exposés of tenement abuses. After a heat wave in 1883 killed a disproportionate number of poor children, the &quot;World&quot; published stories about it, featuring such headlines as &quot;Lines of Little Hearses&quot;. Its coverage spurred action in the city for reform. Hearst reproduced Pulitzer&#x27;s approach in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; and later in the &quot;Journal&quot;.

Charles Chapin was hired in 1898 as city editor of the &quot;Evening World&quot;. He was most known for embracing the sensational and showing little empathy in the face of tragedy, only taking a more solemn tone when reporting on the assassination of William McKinley in 1901. He controlled the newsroom with an iron fist, and was commonly despised by the journalists who worked for him. Chapin fired 108 newspaper men during his tenure. However, Stanley Walker still referred to him as &quot;the greatest city editor that ever lived.&quot; His time at the &quot;World&quot; ended when, after falling into financial ruin, he murdered his wife in 1918. He was sentenced to Sing Sing Prison and died there in 1930.
Frank Irving Cobb was employed on a trial basis by Pulitzer as the editor of the &quot;World&quot; in 1904. Cobb was a fiercely independent Kansan who resisted Pulitzer&#x27;s attempts to &quot;run the office&quot; from his home. The elder man was so invested in the paper that he continually meddled with Cobb&#x27;s work. The two found common ground in their support of Woodrow Wilson, but they had many other areas of disagreement.

When Pulitzer&#x27;s son Ralph took over administrative responsibility of &quot;The World&quot; in 1907, his father wrote a precisely worded resignation. Cobb had it printed in every New York paper—except the &quot;World&quot;. Joseph Pulitzer raged at the insult, but slowly began to respect Cobb&#x27;s editorials and independent spirit. Exchanges, commentaries, and messages between them increased. The good rapport between the two was based largely on Cobb&#x27;s flexibility. In May 1908, Cobb and Pulitzer met to outline plans for a consistent editorial policy.

Pulitzer&#x27;s demands for editorials on contemporary news led to overwork by Cobb. The publisher sent his managing editor on a six-week tour of Europe to restore his spirit. Shortly after Cobb&#x27;s return, Pulitzer died. Cobb then finally published Pulitzer&#x27;s resignation from 1907. Cobb retained the editorial policies he had shared with Pulitzer until he died of cancer in 1923.

===Later years===
When Pulitzer died in 1911, he passed control of the &quot;World&quot; to his sons Ralph, Joseph and Herbert. The &quot;World&quot; continued to grow under its executive editor Herbert Bayard Swope, who hired writers such as Frank Sullivan and Deems Taylor. Among the &quot;World&quot;″s noted journalists were columnists Franklin Pierce Adams (F.P.A.), who wrote &quot;The Conning Tower&quot;; Heywood Broun, who penned &quot;It Seems to Me&quot; on the editorial page; and future hardboiled fiction writer James M. Cain. C. M. Payne created several comic strips for the newspaper.

The paper published the first crossword puzzle in December 1913. The annual reference book called &quot;The World Almanac&quot; was founded by the newspaper, and the name &quot;World&quot; Almanac is directly descended from the newspaper.

The paper ran a twenty-one article series that was an exposé on the inner workings of the Ku Klux Klan, starting September 6, 1921.

In 1931, Pulitzer&#x27;s heirs went to court to sell the &quot;World&quot;. A surrogate court judge decided in their favor; Scripps-Howard chain owner Roy W. Howard purchased the paper to eliminate its competition. He closed the &quot;World&quot; and laid off the staff of 3,000 after the final issue was printed on February 27, 1931, then merely replaced the word &quot;Evening&quot; on his afternoon paper, the &quot;Evening Telegram&quot;, renaming it the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;.

== Comic strips ==

The &quot;New York World&quot; was one of the first newspapers to publish comic strips, starting around 1890, and contributed greatly to the development of the American comic strip. Notable strips that originated with the &quot;World&quot; included Richard F. Outcault&#x27;s &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot; (featuring &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot;), &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot;, &quot;Everyday Movies&quot;, &quot;Fritzi Ritz&quot;, &quot;Joe Jinks&quot;, and &quot;Little Mary Mixup&quot;. Under the names World Feature Service and New York World Press Publishing the company also syndicated comic strips to other newspapers around the country beginning around 1905. With Scripps&#x27; acquisition of the &quot;World&quot; newspaper and its syndication assets in February 1931, the &quot;World&quot;&#x27;s most popular strips were brought over to Scripps&#x27; United Feature Syndicate.

==Legacy==
Janet E. Steele argues that Joseph Pulitzer put a stamp on his age when he brought his brand of journalism from St. Louis to New York in 1883. In his &quot;New York World&quot;, Pulitzer emphasized illustrations, advertising, and a culture of consumption for working men. He believed they saved money to enjoy life with their families when they could, at Coney Island, for example.

By contrast, the long-established editor Charles A. Dana, of &quot;The Sun&quot;, held to a traditional view of the working man as one engaged in a struggle to better his working conditions and to improve himself. Dana thought that readers in the 20th century followed fewer faddish illustrations and wished newspapers did not need advertising. Dana resisted buying a Linotype. In time the more sensational approach to news, advertising, and content triumphed.

==Revival==
On May 16, 2011, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism announced that it was launching an online publication named &quot;The New York World,&quot; in honor of the original newspaper published by Joseph Pulitzer, who founded the graduate school. The university said the mission of the publication would be &quot;to provide New York City citizens with accountability journalism about government operations that affect their lives.&quot; It was to be staffed mainly by those who have completed master&#x27;s or doctoral degrees, and other affiliates of the school. The online publication focuses on data journalism and collaborated with a number of local and national news outlets. The &quot;World&quot; lists contributors and an editor, but has not published new content since 2016.

<text>Christopher John Pearce (born 1 March 1963) is an Australian business executive and former politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 2001 to 2010, representing seat of Aston for the Liberal Party. He served as a parliamentary secretary in the Howard government from 2004 to 2007. Outside of his political career he has worked as a senior executive in the IT and telecommunications industries.

==Early life==
Pearce was born on 1 March 1963 in Lismore, New South Wales. He holds the degree of Bachelor of Business from Monash University, and later completed an MBA at Deakin University and a graduate certificate at the University of Divinity.

Prior to entering parliament, Pearce worked as a manager in the information technology and telecommunications industry. He began his career as a marketing executive with Yamaha Music Australia, later working for Telstra as manager of its MobileNet marketing campaign, as a marketing director with United Telecommunications, as a marketing vice-president with Iridium Satellite, and as Australian managing director of BAE Systems.

==Politics==
Pearce joined the Liberal Party in 1992 and was president of its Rowville branch from 1996 to 1999. He also served on the Knox City Council from 1997 to 2000.

Pearce was elected to the House of Representatives at the 2001 Aston by-election, retaining the seat for the Liberal Party following the death of incumbent MP Peter Nugent. He was re-elected at the 2001, 2004 and 2007 federal elections. Pearce was parliamentary secretary to Treasurer Peter Costello from 2004 to 2007. He was responsible for the Howard government&#x27;s proposed changes to financial services legislation, reported in 2006 as &quot;the biggest overhaul since the corporate law economic reform program began in 1997&quot;.

In September 2008, Pearce was included in Malcolm Turnbull&#x27;s shadow ministry with responsibility for the financial services, superannuation and corporate law portfolio. He served as a shadow minister until June 2009, when he announced that he would retire from federal politics at the next election.

==Later activities==
In July 2010, it was reported that Pearce would join Telstra as a business development executive responsible for contracts with government agencies. He was appointed chair of Anglicare Victoria in 2016. He was appointed as an adjunct professor at Deakin Business School in 2019 and has also served as deputy chair of the St. Vincent&#x27;s Institute of Medical Research.

<text>Katharine Juliet Ross (born January 29, 1940) is a retired American actress. Her accolades include an Academy Award nomination, a BAFTA Award, and two Golden Globe Awards.

An alumna of The Actors Workshop, Ross made her television debut in 1962. She made her film debut in the Civil War-themed drama &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (1965), and had supporting parts in &quot;Mister Buddwing&quot; and &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; (both 1966) before being cast in Curtis Harrington&#x27;s &quot;Games&quot; (1967), a thriller co-starring James Caan and Simone Signoret. At Signoret&#x27;s recommendation, Ross was cast as Elaine Robinson in Mike Nichols&#x27; comedy-drama &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), which saw her receive significant critical acclaim, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, a BAFTA nomination, and Golden Globe win for New Star of the Year. She garnered further acclaim for her roles in two 1969 Westerns: &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; and &quot;Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here&quot;, for both of which she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress.

In the 1970s, Ross had a leading role in the horror film &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (1975), for which she won the Saturn Award for Best Actress, and won her second Golden Globe award for her performance in the drama &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976). Her other roles during this period included the disaster film &quot;The Swarm&quot; (1978), the supernatural horror film &quot;The Legacy&quot; (1978), and the science-fiction film &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980). Ross spent the majority of the 1980s appearing in a number of made-for-TV films, including &quot;Murder in Texas&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Shadow Riders&quot; (1982), and later starred on the network series &quot;The Colbys&quot; from 1985 to 1987.

Ross spent the majority of the 1990s in semiretirement, although she returned to film with a supporting part in Richard Kelly&#x27;s cult film &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001). In 2016, she provided a voice role for the animated comedy series &quot;American Dad!&quot;, and the following year starred in the comedy-drama &quot;The Hero&quot; (2017), opposite her husband, Sam Elliott.

==Early life==
Ross was born in Los Angeles on January 29, 1940, when her father, Dudley Tyng Ross (1906–1991) was a lieutenant in the Navy. A native of Sonyea, New York, he had also worked for the Associated Press. Ross&#x27;s mother, the former Katharine Elizabeth Washburn (née Hall; 1909–1993), was born in Indianapolis and later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. She married Ross&#x27;s father there in 1937. The family resided for a time in Washington, D.C. before moving to Walnut Creek, California.

Ross was a keen horse rider in her youth and was friends with rodeo rider Casey Tibbs. She graduated from Las Lomas High School in 1957. Ross studied for one year at Santa Rosa Junior College, where she was introduced to acting via a production of &quot;The King and I&quot;. While attending SRJC, she met her first husband, future actor Joel Fabiani. Ross transferred to Diablo Valley College in 1958, and starred in a student film by Jim and Artie Mitchell (of O&#x27;Farrell Theatre fame). Eventually moving to San Francisco, she joined The Actors Workshop and was with them for three years. For one role in Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Balcony&quot;, she appeared nude on stage.

==Career==

In 1964, Ross was cast by John Houseman as Cordelia in a stage production of &quot;King Lear&quot;.

While at the workshop, she began acting in television series in Los Angeles to earn extra money. She was brought to Hollywood by Metro, dropped, then picked up by Universal.

Ross auditioned but was not hired for a role in the film &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961). Her first television role was in &quot;Sam Benedict&quot; in 1962.

She was signed by agent Wally Hiller, and in 1964, Ross appeared in episodes of &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Mr. Novak&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, and &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; (&quot;Dividing Wall&quot;, 1963), as well as playing the love interest of Heath Barkley opposite Lee Majors on &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (season one, episode seven-&quot;Winner Loses All&quot;). She screen-tested for &quot;The Young Lovers&quot;.

Ross made her first film, &quot;Shenandoah&quot; in 1965, playing the daughter-in-law of James Stewart. She returned to guest-starring on shows including &quot;The Loner&quot;, &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, and &quot;The Road West&quot;. MGM put her in an unsold TV pilot about Bible stories. She signed a long-term deal with Universal, which called her an &quot;American Samantha Eggar&quot;, despite some misgivings: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want a contract in the movies, but a lot of people convinced me it was a good thing to do.&quot;

MGM borrowed her for supporting parts in &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; (1966) and &quot;Mister Buddwing&quot; (1966), the latter starring James Garner.

===Mainstream breakthrough===

At Universal, Ross starred in a television film with Doug McClure, &quot;The Longest Hundred Miles&quot; (1967), then co-starred in Curtis Harrington&#x27;s psychological thriller, &quot;Games&quot; (1967) with Simone Signoret and James Caan, which she later called &quot;terrible&quot;.

Ross&#x27;s breakthrough role was as Elaine Robinson in Mike Nichols&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), opposite Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft. Ross was only eight years younger than Bancroft, who played her mother in the film. She had been recommended to director Nichols by Signoret. This part, in which Ross plays a young woman who elopes with a young man who had an affair with her mother, earned Ross an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and won her a Golden Globe Award as New Star of the Year. Commenting on her critical accolades at the time, Ross said, &quot;I&#x27;m not a movie star... that system is dying and I&#x27;d like to help it along.&quot;

She later said at this time, &quot;I got sent everything in town, but Universal wouldn&#x27;t loan me out.&quot; After eight months, she was in &quot;Hellfighters&quot; (1968) playing John Wayne&#x27;s daughter, who romances Jim Hutton.

Ross was cast as a Native American woman in Universal&#x27;s Western film &quot;Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here&quot; (1969), starring Robert Redford. In August 1968, she signed a new contract with Universal to make two films a year for seven years. She refused several roles (including Jacqueline Bisset&#x27;s role in &quot;Bullitt&quot;) before accepting the part of Etta Place in &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; (1969), co-starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford, which was another massive commercial hit. She was paid $175,000 for her performance in the film. For her roles in both &quot;Tell Them Willie Boy is Here&quot; and &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, Ross won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress.

She was dropped by Universal in the spring of 1969 for refusing to play a stewardess in &quot;Airport&quot; starring Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin, another role that went to Jacqueline Bisset. Because of this, she later lost out to Tuesday Weld on a film she greatly desired to do, the adaptation of Joan Didion&#x27;s novel &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot;, because it was a Universal production. Instead, she had a starring role in the drama &quot;Fools&quot; (1970) opposite Jason Robards.

===Semi-retirement and comeback===
Ross dropped out of Hollywood for a while after marrying cinematographer Conrad Hall. She occasionally acted, appearing in &quot;Get to Know Your Rabbit&quot; (1972), &quot;They Only Kill Their Masters&quot; (1972), which reunited her with James Garner, and &quot;Chance and Violence&quot; (1974) with Yves Montand. She refused several more roles, including a part in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;.

Preferring stage acting, Ross returned to the small playhouses in Los Angeles for much of the 1970s. &quot;I&#x27;m aware that I have the reputation for being difficult&quot;, she later said.

One of her best-known roles came in 1975&#x27;s film &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;, for which she won the Saturn Award for Best Actress.

She reprised the role of Etta Place in a 1976 ABC television film, &quot;Wanted: The Sundance Woman&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;. Ross subsequently appeared in the drama film &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1977) about a doomed ocean liner carrying Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, which earned her a second Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. She was also in &quot;The Betsy&quot; (1978) and the disaster film &quot;The Swarm&quot; (1978). Next, Ross co-starred opposite Sam Elliott in the supernatural horror film &quot;The Legacy&quot; (1978), playing a woman who finds herself subject to an ancestral curse at an English estate. Ross had previously worked with Elliott on &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;.

===Television===
From 1979, Ross starred in several television movies, including &quot;Murder by Natural Causes&quot; in 1979 with Hal Holbrook, Barry Bostwick and Richard Anderson, &quot;Rodeo Girl&quot; in 1980, &quot;Murder in Texas&quot; (1981) and &quot;Marian Rose White&quot; (1982). She had a supporting role in &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980) and &quot;Wrong Is Right&quot; (1982), but focused largely on television films: &quot;The Shadow Riders&quot; (1982), a remake of &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; (1983), &quot;Travis McGee&quot; (1982) with Elliott, &quot;Secrets of a Mother and Daughter&quot; (1983), &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; (1986), and &quot;&quot; (1986) with Elliott.

She had a role in the 1980s television series &quot;The Colbys&quot; opposite Charlton Heston as Francesca Scott Colby, mother of &quot;Dynasty&quot; crossover character Jeff Colby.

===Later career===
Ross co-wrote the teleplay and starred in &quot;Conagher&quot; (1991) alongside husband Sam Elliott and was in &quot;A Climate for Killing&quot; (1991), and &quot;Home Before Dark&quot; (1997).

She played Donnie&#x27;s therapist in the 2001 cult classic &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;. She was in &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; (2002), and &quot;Capital City&quot; (2004) and played Carly Schroeder&#x27;s grandmother in the 2006 independent film &quot;Eye of the Dolphin&quot;. She was also in &quot;Slip, Tumble &amp; Slide&quot; (2015).

In January 2015, she appeared at the Malibu Playhouse in the first of a series titled &quot;A Conversation With&quot;, interviewed by Steven Gaydos. That February, she again co-starred with Sam Elliott in &quot;Love Letters&quot;, also at the Malibu Playhouse.

In 2017, she appeared as Sam Elliott&#x27;s former wife in &quot;The Hero&quot;, in which he played an aging Western star.

==Personal life==
Ross has married five times. On February 28, 1960, she married her college sweetheart, Joel Fabiani, though the marriage lasted only two years before ending in divorce.

She married her second husband John Marion in 1964, but they were divorced in 1967.

After completing &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, Ross married the film&#x27;s cinematographer, three-time Oscar-winner Conrad Hall, in 1969. They divorced in 1973.

She married Gaetano &quot;Tom&quot; Lisi in 1974 after making &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;; they met when he was a chauffeur and technician on the set. They divorced in 1979.

Ross married Sam Elliott on May 1, 1984. They had worked together on &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, and began dating in 1978 after they were reacquainted on the set of &quot;The Legacy&quot;. On September 17, 1984—four months after her marriage to Elliott and four months before turning 45—Ross gave birth to a daughter, Cleo Rose Elliott.

In 2011, Ross filed a restraining order against Cleo Elliott after Cleo allegedly attacked her with a pair of scissors. Ross stated in a court document that her daughter has had violent episodes since childhood.

<doc id="593171" wikidata="Q206718" url="?curid=593171" title="Teat">
<text>A teat is the projection from the mammary glands of mammals from which milk flows or is ejected for the purpose of feeding young. In many mammals, the teat projects from the udder. The number of teats varies by mammalian species and often corresponds to the average litter size for that animal. In some cases, the teats of female animals are milked for the purpose of human consumption.

The quality of some domesticated animals is determined by the establishment of desired characteristics, such as teat size and placement.

==Number and positioning in other animals==
The number and positioning of mammary glands and teats varies widely among mammals. The protruding teats and accompanying glands can be located anywhere along the two milk lines. In general, most mammals develop mammary glands in pairs along these lines, with a number approximating the number of young typically birthed at a time. The number of teats varies from 2 (in elephants and anthropoids) to 18 (in pigs). Marsupials usually have 4 to 12 teats, but the Virginia opossum has 13, one of the few mammals with an odd number. The following table lists the number and position of teats and glands found in a range of mammals:

==Disease of teats==
A number of diseases can affect the teats of cattle.
*Pseudocowpox
* Warts caused by bovine papillomavirus
*Teat-end hyperkeratosis
*Dermatitis
*Frostbite
*Udder sores or necrotic dermatitis

Goats are also affected by diseases of the teats.

==Etymology==
Teat is derived from the Old French or Dutch word, &quot;tete&quot; or the Greek word τιτθύς. An alternative, but possibly not unrelated, would be the Welsh word &quot;teth&quot; or the Old English, &quot;titt&quot; which is still used as a slang term. The words &quot;teat&quot; and &quot;tit&quot; share a Germanic ancestor. The second of the two, tit, was inherited directly from Proto-Germanic, while the first entered English via Old French.

<text>Tanya Joan Plibersek (born 2 December 1969) is an Australian politician who has been Minister for the Environment and Water in the Albanese government since 2022. She was deputy leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 2013 to 2019 and has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Sydney since 1998. She previously held ministerial office in the Rudd and Gillard governments.

Plibersek was born in Sydney to Slovenian immigrant parents and grew up in Sutherland Shire. She has degrees from the University of Technology Sydney and Macquarie University, and worked in the NSW Government&#x27;s Domestic Violence Unit before entering parliament. Plibersek was elected to the Division of Sydney at the 1998 federal election, aged 28. She joined the shadow cabinet in 2004, and when Labor won the 2007 election was made Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women.

In a cabinet reshuffle in 2010, Plibersek was made Minister for Human Services and Minister for Social Inclusion. She was promoted to Minister for Health the following year, and held that position until Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 2013 election. Plibersek was then elected as deputy to new ALP leader Bill Shorten. Plibersek served as deputy opposition leader until Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 2019 Australian federal election. She was subsequently made shadow minister for education under new opposition leader Anthony Albanese. Upon Labor&#x27;s victory at the 2022 Australian federal election, she was appointed Minister for the Environment and Water. She is a senior figure in the Labor Left faction.

==Early life==

Plibersek was born in Sydney, the youngest of three children born to Joseph and Rose Plibersek. Her elder brother Ray is a lawyer, and her eldest brother Phillip (d. 1997) was a geologist. Her parents were born in small Slovenian villages, arriving in Australia unknown to each other as part of the post-war immigration scheme. Her mother (née &quot;Rosalija Repič&quot;) was born in Podvinci, and came to Australia via Italy. Her father (né &quot;Jože Pliberšek&quot;) was born in Kočno pri Polskavi, and came to Australia via Austria. He found work as a labourer on the Snowy Mountains Scheme, and later spent 20 years working for Qantas as a plumber and gas fitter.

Plibersek grew up in the suburb of Oyster Bay in Sydney&#x27;s Sutherland Shire. She attended Oyster Bay Public School and Jannali Girls High School, where she was the dux. She joined the Labor Party at the age of 15. Plibersek studied journalism at the University of Technology Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in communications. She then took a Masters in Public Policy and Politics at Macquarie University. After a failed attempt to secure a cadetship with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), she found work with the Domestic Violence Unit at the New South Wales Government&#x27;s Office for the Status and Advancement of Women. She found working with the state women&#x27;s minister Kerry Chikarovski &quot;demoralising&quot; and later criticised her for focusing on the glass ceiling rather than other women&#x27;s issues. Plibersek subsequently joined the office of Senator Bruce Childs, before switching to work for Senator George Campbell as a research officer.

==Politics==

===Opposition (1998–2007)===
Plibersek was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election, aged 28, retaining the Division of Sydney for the ALP following the retirement of Peter Baldwin. With the support of George Campbell&#x27;s &quot;hard left&quot; faction, she won preselection for the seat against twelve other candidates, including ten other women. In the lead-up to the ballot she &quot;wrote to each branch member three or four times, attended branch meetings virtually every night, gave talks to community groups, and contributed to three candidates&#x27; debates&quot;.

Plibersek supported Kim Beazley&#x27;s unsuccessful candidacies in the 2003 ALP leadership votes, where he initially lost to Simon Crean and then later to Mark Latham. In July 2003 she and Anthony Albanese publicly criticised Crean for his rejection of the party&#x27;s policy on a Second Sydney Airport.

After the 2004 election, Plibersek was elected to Latham&#x27;s shadow ministry and allocated three portfolios – youth; the status of women; and work and family, community and early childhood education. In June 2005, after Latham was succeeded as opposition leader by Beazley, she retained the youth and status of women portfolios and was given responsibility for childcare. Upon the release of &quot;The Latham Diaries&quot; she described him as &quot;a negative and critical person&quot;.

Plibersek publicly supported Beazley against Kevin Rudd in the 2006 leadership spill, though was retained in Rudd&#x27;s shadow ministry after his defeat of Beazley, with the portfolios of youth; the status of women; and human services and housing.

===Rudd and Gillard governments===

Following the 2007 federal election, Plibersek was appointed Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women in the First Rudd Ministry. Following the 2010 federal election, Plibersek was appointed Minister for Human Services and Minister for Social Inclusion. Her appointment took effect following the birth of Plibersek&#x27;s youngest son Louis, and soon afterwards Plibersek directed the Human Services response to the 2010–11 Queensland floods. As Minister for Human Services, Plibersek established emergency and recovery centres to provide urgent support to flood-affected communities.

====Housing====

As Minister for Housing, Plibersek established the National Rental Affordability Scheme to build 50,000 affordable rental homes, invested $6 billion in social housing to build 21,600 new homes and repair 80,000 homes, and provided $550 million for homelessness services. The new housing was built ahead of time and under budget. She also established the Housing Affordability Fund and First Home Saver Accounts. In December 2008, along with Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister at that time, Plibersek released the Government&#x27;s White Paper on Homelessness, &quot;The Road Home&quot;, which expressed a goal of halving homelessness by 2020. This goal was abandoned by the incoming Abbott government which cut homelessness funding and ended the National Rental Affordability Scheme and First Home Saver Accounts.

====Women&#x27;s issues====
As Minister for the Status of Women, Plibersek convened the National Council to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children in May 2008, and released the National Council&#x27;s &quot;Plan for Australia to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children&quot; in March 2009. Plibersek also addressed the 2009 United Nations International Women&#x27;s Day event, attended by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and announced Australia&#x27;s formal accession to the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Plibersek said that acceding to the Optional Protocol &quot;will send a strong message that Australia is serious about promoting gender equality and that we are prepared to be judged by international human rights standards.&quot;

====Health====

As Minister for Health Plibersek established &quot;Grow Up Smiling&quot;, a $4 billion package to support better dental care for children, which expanded Medicare-subsided dental check-ups for children from age 2 to 17. She introduced free Gardasil vaccinations, previously only available for girls, for boys to protect against cancers caused by HPV – a world first. Along with the previous Health Minister, Nicola Roxon, Plibersek also implemented world-leading plain packaging of tobacco laws which saw smoking rates drop to 13%.

When Plibersek was Minister for Health, Australia achieved the best 5-year cancer survival rates in the world. Plibersek also delivered 1,300 more hospital beds and 60,000 additional doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. She also oversaw the funding, construction and/or opening of a number of new facilities, including the Chris O’Brien Lifehouse Cancer Centre, the Kinghorn Cancer Centre, the Launceston Multi-Purpose Health Centre, and a new medical and dental school as well as new facilities for the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) in Adelaide.

===Opposition (2013–2022)===

Plibersek was unanimously elected deputy leader of the Labor Party (and thus Deputy Leader of the Opposition) on 14 October 2013, following the leadership election that had seen Bill Shorten succeed Kevin Rudd as leader. She was Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development until July 2016. Following the 2016 election, she was made Shadow Minister for Education and Shadow Minister for Women. Shorten said handing Ms Plibersek the education portfolio was &quot;about putting a great policy thinker on the political frontline&quot;.

Plibersek was re-elected at the 2019 election with a swing of 5.7 points to the Labor Party. Following the party&#x27;s defeat at the federal election of 2019 and Bill Shorten&#x27;s immediate resignation as party leader, Plibersek made it known that she was interested in standing in the leadership election, and was supported by Shorten and former prime minister Julia Gillard; however, she concluded that &quot;now is not my time&quot;, citing family responsibilities.

After Anthony Albanese&#x27;s victory in the leadership contest, Plibersek was appointed Shadow Minister for Education and Training in his new shadow cabinet. In January 2021 Albanese also appointed her Shadow Minister for Women.

=== Government (2022–present) ===
Plibersek was appointed Minister for the Environment and Water in the Albanese government.

Upon Peter Dutton&#x27;s election as Leader of the Opposition, Plibersek compared Dutton to Lord Voldemort. In a radio interview, she stated:

Plibersek later apologised. In a radio interview, Dutton called the claims &quot;unfortunate&quot; but &quot;water off a duck&#x27;s back&quot;, also noting that he wasn&#x27;t &quot;bald by choice&quot; and was diagnosed with a skin condition several years ago. Plibersek&#x27;s apology was welcomed by newly elected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in an interview with ABC News.

==Political positions==
Plibersek is a member of the Labor Party&#x27;s left faction.

=== Economy and employment ===
Plibersek has argued that government should actively invest in the economy to promote growth and equality, calling for a federal commitment to a policy of full employment where &quot;Australians who can work, can get a job&quot;. During the coronavirus recession of 2020, she has advocated government stimulus over tax cuts for high income earners. In September 2020, she explained her priorities for economic recovery: &quot;We need to be building things in Australia to support both the skilled trades people and the apprentices that we should be training right now. We need to build things. We need to make things. We need to care for people. We need secure jobs with decent pay&quot;.

Education

Plibersek is a long-term supporter of investing in education. As the shadow Minister for Education and Training she has developed policies across schools, universities, TAFE and vocational education. Prior to the 2019 election, these policies included increasing school funding by $14 billion over a decade, to the creation of a new Evidence Institute for Schools and instituting a review of the country&#x27;s NAPLAN testing system. In higher education Plibersek promised to reintroduce the demand driven system of university funding, creating an extra 200,000 places for students.

Energy

Plibersek is a strong supporter of renewable energy and transitioning towards clean energy production. She has argued that the renewables industry is key to promoting new jobs, assisting local manufacturing, lowering carbon emissions and reducing power prices. She has also endorsed programs to help households install solar panels on their homes – which have been adopted by over two and a half million Australia households. In 2018, Plibersek argued against providing federal subsidies for new coal fired power plants.

Housing

After the 2007 election, Plibersek was made Federal Minister for Housing in the Rudd government. As part of the government&#x27;s response to the Global Financial Crisis, Plibersek implemented a number of policies that both grew the housing stock and stimulated the Australian economy. These policies included the First Home Owners Boost, providing up to $21,000 for people buying new dwellings, the National Rental Affordability Scheme, providing incentives for investors to build properties for low and middle income Australians, and $6 billion for the construction, repair and improvement of social housing. Plibersek also released the Homelessness White Paper, which set out a comprehensive national plan to tackle homelessness in Australia with significant funding attached. Plibersek has argued that significant new investment in social and public housing should be part of Australia&#x27;s response to the coronavirus economic downturn.

Welfare

Plibersek supports an increase to Newstart, Australia&#x27;s then-unemployment benefit, arguing that the current rate is too low, &quot;trapping people in poverty&quot; who are &quot;just surviving&quot; on an allowance of $40 a day.

===Social Issues===

Women&#x27;s reproductive rights

Plibersek is pro-choice. As Minister for Health, Plibersek approved listing the abortion drug RU-486 on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Plibersek described the provision of the medicine as &quot;a good thing in the situation where women are faced with one of the most difficult decisions that they will ever make&quot;. Anti-abortion groups criticised the move, with one campaigner, Margaret Tighe, labelling it a &quot;gross abuse of power.&quot; Other commentators, including Clementine Ford, labelled the decision &quot;progressive&quot;.

First Nations people

Plibersek supports instituting an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, based on the recommendations made in the &quot;Uluru Statement from the Heart&quot;. As Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, she stated that implementing the Indigenous Voice was her party&#x27;s priority in Indigenous affairs, alongside ‘closing the gap’, particularly in health and education.

An Australian republic

Plibersek supports Australia becoming a Republic. As a first term Member of Parliament in 1999, she campaigned for the yes vote in the constitutional referendum to replace the Queen and Governor-General with a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament.

LGBT rights

From the 1990s onward, Plibersek campaigned for the removal of discrimination against same-sex de facto couples from federal legislation, raising the issue formally in Parliament on multiple occasions during her parliamentary career (including 1999, 2006, and 2008). In her regular paid advertisement in the &quot;South Sydney Herald&quot;, Plibersek wrote that &quot;The passing of these reforms to federal legislation was one of the proudest moments of my time in the Australian Parliament&quot; and she has marched in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade almost every year for three decades.

As deputy leader, Plibersek led the push to make support for same-sex marriage binding Labor policy which resulted in many Labor MPs speaking out publicly in support of same-sex marriage. Plibersek seconded a private members bill to legalise same sex marriage, moved by Labor leader Bill Shorten. She opposed the 2017 postal plebiscite, arguing it was unnecessary and divisive, but campaigned strongly for the ‘yes’ vote during the plebiscite campaign.

Multiculturalism and citizenship

As an Australian with Slovenian heritage, Plibersek is vocal advocate for multiculturalism. On an episode of Q&amp;A in 2018 she clashed with conservative Senator Matthew Canavan on the topic of immigration, arguing against Canavan&#x27;s claim that immigrants congregated through ‘ghettoisation’. Before the 2019 election, Plibersek pledged $8 million towards community language schools, to expand language training for children.

In January 2020 Plibersek aroused controversy in an Australia Day speech, calling for children to learn the Australian citizenship pledge at school. In the speech, Plibersek argued that progressives should feel more comfortable with the concept of patriotism: &quot;You can be proud of your citizenship and dedicated to progress. You can cherish this nation and want to make it better. You can be a progressive and love your country: I certainly do.&quot;

Foreign aid

As Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Plibersek opposed the cuts to foreign aid made by the Abbott Liberal government. At the 2016 election Labor promised to reverse those cuts if elected.

Iraq

Plibersek opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2003, when then-US President George W. Bush visited Australia, Tanya presented national security adviser Condoleezza Rice with a letter, signed by 43 Labor MPs, explaining why Labor parliamentarians opposed Australia invading Iraq without United Nations approval. She also stated in Parliament, &quot;I do not support an attack on Iraq. I particularly do not support a pre-emptive first strike. Nor do I support any action that is initiated by the US alone rather than being sanctioned by the United Nations.&quot;

East Timor

While Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2016, Plibersek proposed that Australia redraw its maritime border with East Timor. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, &quot;Ms Plibersek lamented that Australia&#x27;s pivotal role in securing East Timor&#x27;s independence – &quot;a proud moment&quot; – was being tarnished by its refusal to negotiate a new, permanent maritime boundary with East Timor. &quot;The maritime boundary dispute has poisoned relations with our newest neighbour. This must change for their sake and ours,&quot; Ms Plibersek said.&quot;
This position was later adopted by the Liberal government, and a new border agreement treaty was signed in 2018.

Israel

Speaking in the House of Representatives on 17 September 2002, Plibersek said: &quot;I can think of a rogue state which consistently ignores UN resolutions, whose ruler is a war criminal responsible for the massacres of civilians in refugee camps outside its borders. The US supports and funds this country. This year it gave it a blank cheque to continue its repression of its enemies. It uses US military hardware to bulldoze homes and kill civilians. It is called Israel, and the war criminal is Ariel Sharon. Needless to say, the US does not mention the UN resolutions that Israel has ignored for 30 years; it just continues sending the money...&quot;

Plibersek&#x27;s remarks again gained prominence in October 2013, after she and Bill Shorten were elected as deputy leader and leader of the Labor Party, respectively. After choosing to take on the foreign affairs portfolio while in opposition, Liberal Party MP Julie Bishop, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, said Plibersek should &quot;publicly retract those statements&quot;. &quot;The Australian&quot; noted that Plibersek&#x27;s appointment was likely to be criticised by the Jewish community in Australia.

But the Executive Council of Australian Jewry expressed satisfaction in Plibersek&#x27;s elevation to the deputy leadership, noting that she had ‘developed friendly relations with the Jewish Community’. Plibersek visited Israel and the State of Palestine in February 2014, meeting with the Prime Minister of Palestine, Rami Hamdallah.

==Personal life==
Plibersek lives in Sydney with her husband Michael Coutts-Trotter, who is a senior NSW public servant, and three children. Her daughter Anna Coutts-Trotter was a victim of an abusive relationship as a teenager.

Following the 2010 federal election, when Labor retained government with the support of the Australian Greens and independents, parliamentary numbers were finely balanced. After some controversy, Plibersek was granted a pair by the Coalition so that her absence from the House of Representatives while on maternity leave did not affect the result of votes. She gave birth to her son later that year.

In September 2016, her older brother Ray Plibersek was elected to Sutherland Shire council representing C Ward for the Australian Labor Party.

Plibersek is fond of bushwalking and Jane Austen novels.

<doc id="593178" wikidata="Q5121488" url="?curid=593178" title="Circle of Three">
<text>Circle Of Three is a series of young adult paperback novels by Michael Thomas Ford under the pseudonym Isobel Bird. It follows the lives of three teenage girls from different social cliques, who come together over a mutual interest in witchcraft. It was published between February 5, 2001 and March 19, 2002.

==History==
Isobel Bird wrote the series to do what many non-fiction books about Wicca fail to do: show how Wiccans experience their religion. Thus, the books cover a wide range of topics related to Wiccan life beyond outright practice, including conflicts with mainstream society, the diversity of the Neo-Pagan community, and legal rights.

Originally released in mass market paperback, the series is currently out of print, though the books are still available used and as eBooks. The eBooks feature bonus material, such as interviews with Isobel Bird, crafts, and magical exercises. Chapter excerpts are available on the HarperCollins website.

The first nine books are available in Germany and France, where the series is known as Magic Circle. It is published in German by Schneiderbuch. The first four books have been published in Castilian Spanish under the series name El Círculo de Fuego, by Editorial Diagonal (Grup 62). The first six books have been published in Italian as Il Cerchio delle Streghe by Gruppo Editorale Armenia.

In 2005, Michael Thomas Ford revealed that he had written the Circle of Three series, using the pen name, Isobel Bird. He also wrote a short story titled &quot;Ever After&quot; for the YA horror anthology &quot;666: The Number of the Beast&quot; under that name.

==Synopsis==
Kate Morgan, a preppy, popular basketball player, checks out a book of spells while doing research for her history paper on medieval witch trials. She casts a love spell, which leads to disaster. She seeks the help of two girls who had previously checked out the spellbook, Annie Crandall, an intellectual, and Cooper Rivers, an alternative outsider. After putting things to rights, the three decide to continue studying Wicca together, which they do at a local New Age store called Crones&#x27; Circle. Each of them face various conflicts on her path, both external and internal. Kate is torn between fitting in and embracing the Wiccan path; Annie tries to reconcile her scientific, rational thinking with her new-found intuitive, emotional faith, as well as coming to terms with her parents&#x27; deaths years before; the headstrong and independent Cooper has trouble adjusting to both the unpredictability of magic and the novelty of intense friendship.

The series takes place over a period of roughly one year and two months, during which Kate, Annie, and Cooper undergo the traditional year-and-a-day of Wiccan study before being initiated into a coven.

==Main characters==
===Kate Morgan===

At the beginning of the series Kate Morgan is a 15-year-old sophomore who enjoys her time on the girls&#x27; basketball team and crushing over the most popular boy in school; Scott Coogan. In the pilot novel she is friends with fellow basketball teammates Tara Redding, Jessica Talbot and the self-involved ringleader, Sherrie Adams who is known for spreading gossip and rumors whether they be true or false. But as the series progresses she becomes friends with Annie Crandall, Cooper Rivers and later, a runaway teen Sasha, who is introduced in the 2nd book Merry Meet.

Throughout the series Kate is living with her parents Mr. Morgan; who owns and works at a sporting goods store and Mrs. Morgan, who works at a catering company, while her elder brother Kyle is away at college. Kate&#x27;s relationships with her mother and father are relatively normal and good natured, but when she &quot;comes out of the broom closet&quot; everything changes when they force her to see a psychiatrist and ground her from seeing her friends. However, after Kate convinces them to perform a healing ritual on their ill Aunt Annette &quot;Netty&quot;, and slowly gets them to know her Wiccan teachers Sophia and Archer, their relationship begins to mend and gets back on good graces.

In the first novel, Kate playfully performs a love spell that enchants her crush, senior Scott Coogan, into noticing her and eventually falling in love with her. The spell, although seemingly innocent enough, backfires due to its selfish connotations and causes a series of incidents which ultimately causes Kate to seek the help of Annie Crandall and later Cooper Rivers, two socially awkward teenage girls in her grade who also checked out the same book of spells which tempted Kate into the whole debacle. The girls form an unlikely alliance and bond that initially solves the problem of the backfired spell, and later, when they choose to study witchcraft at a local bookstore, &quot;Crone&#x27;s Circle&quot;, which caters to Paganism, leads them down a path of discovery, betrayal, fear, and ultimately renewed faith in themselves as young women. For Kate especially, her journey in the series leads her down a path that challenges her beliefs and the conventional norms her family has set in place for her. Shifting from a relationship with normal guy Scott to fellow Wiccan Tyler, who is the son of one of her teachers, Kate learns how connecting with Wicca and learning how to be truthful to herself and those important in her life, ultimately will help her be a better person.

Throughout the series Kate faces a number of trials, such as telling her parents and brother the truth about her study of wicca, dabbling in the sacred art of Santeria, dealing with the illness of her favorite aunt, balancing her old friends and new friends in her life, and the effect witchcraft has on it all.

==Books==
The first four books are told from the point of view of only one girl each. Kate is the center of &quot;So Mote It Be&quot; and &quot;Merry Meet&quot;; Cooper is the center of &quot;Second Sight&quot;; Annie is the center of &quot;What the Cards Said&quot;. However, starting with Book 5: &quot;In the Dreaming&quot;, the point of view switches among the three girls, alternating chapters, for the rest of the series.

===Book 1: So Mote It Be===

:&quot;With this ribbon I do bind&quot;
:&quot;my heart to yours and yours to mine.&quot;
:&quot;Love, I call you, come to me,&quot;
:&quot;As is my will, so mote it be.&quot;

When 15-year-old Kate Morgan decides to cast a love spell, the end results are catastrophic, and she cannot stop it by herself. But the book of spells she checked out from the school library tells her of two strangers who can help her-but only if she can find them.

===Book 2: Merry Meet===

:&quot;Joined together, hand in hand, our circle gathers round,&quot; 
:&quot;to work our magic, weave the web, and dance on sacred ground.&quot; 
:&quot;By the Goddess we are called, witch to witch and friend to friend,&quot; 
:&quot;to merry meet, and merry part and merry meet again.&quot;

A book of spells brought three unlikely friends; Kate, Annie and Cooper together. Now the three of them are compelled to learn more, and the door is opened with the stirring ritual of the Vernal Equinox.

===Book 3: Second Sight===

:&quot;Show me places cloaked in secrets,&quot;
:&quot;pierce the gloom of darkest night.&quot;
:&quot;Reveal the one that which has been hidden,&quot;
:&quot;Let her see with second sight.&quot;
:&quot;Let only the one have the third eye&quot;

Kate, Annie, and Cooper are Wiccans-joined by magic bound to nature. Their dreams have turned to visions of a missing girl, calling to them for help...

===Book 4: What the Cards Said===

:&quot;Cards of fortune, tell your story,&quot;
:&quot;Answer all I&#x27;ve come to ask.&quot;
:&quot;Let the draw set forth the course&quot;
:&quot;of what has been and yet may pass.&quot;

When Annie discovers the ancient cards of Tarot, her fascination with them spirals beyond her control, when her readings become reality. As if cursed, Annie faces her two friends Kate and Cooper with this new-found power-a power that threatens the very strength of their Wiccan bond.

===Book 5: In the Dreaming===

:&quot;On the eve of fair midsummer,&quot;
:&quot;Longest day and shortest night,&quot;
:&quot;Faerie magic, fill these woods&quot;
:&quot;with joyous song and laughter bright.&quot;

On the eve of Midsummer; one of the most magical nights of the year, finds Kate, Annie, and Cooper celebrating the most joyous sabbat with nature-and a few not unwelcome strangers. On a night when identities and emotions become tangled and confused under the strange solstice sky, one will be led astray.

===Book 6: Ring of Light===

:&quot;Here within the healing circle,&quot;
:&quot;Bathe in light and pain dispel.&quot;
:&quot;All that sickens, all that troubles,&quot;
:&quot;wash away and be made well.&quot;

Disillusioned from her time during the Midsummer festivities, Cooper abandons the Wiccan circle and Kate and Annie are left without her. But when an illness threatens someone close to one of them, Cooper returns. But can the circle, once broken, ever be restored?

===Book 7: Blue Moon===

:&quot;Ancient moon, o ageless traveler,&quot;
:&quot;sailing on the sea of stars,&quot;
:&quot;As once more you come to fullness,&quot;
:&quot;Turn your shining face to ours.&quot;

The second full moon of the month-the blue moon-is a time when powers are heightened, with unpredictable results. However, when Annie attempts the channeling practice called aspecting, she changes into someone Kate and Cooper hardly recognize. Can their combined strength restore Annie&#x27;s spirit?

===Book 8: The Five Paths===

:&quot;North and South and East and West,&quot;
:&quot;Earth and Fire, Air and Water,&quot;
:&quot;And the fifth path, center&#x27;s spirit,&quot;
:&quot;on it walk the searching daughters.&quot;

The five-pointed star is the Wiccan symbol of the spirit, and that&#x27;s how Cooper wears it. Those not versed in the ways of the Craft find it unsettling, however. Will Cooper, Annie, and Kate be able to withstand the tide of controversy bearing down upon them or will their circle break apart forever?

===Book 9: Through the Veil===

:&quot;As the year comes to an ending,&quot;
:&quot;In the hour &#x27;tween old and new,&quot;
:&quot;part the veil and let pass&quot;
:&quot;the spirits who would travel through.&quot;

As Annie, Kate, and Cooper prepare for Samhain, they are filled with anticipation. It is a time when the veil between the worlds is thin, and those who have passed into spirit world may be more easily contacted. Those Annie hold dear dwell behind this veil already-will she find them on this eve of Wiccan celebration?

===Book 10: Making the Saint===

:&quot;In the circle ringed with fire,&quot;
:&quot;stand and meet your chosen one.&quot;
:&quot;Dance among the laughing spirits,&quot;
:&quot;and listen as their song is sung.&quot;

A mysterious stranger shows Kate, Annie and Cooper how to connect with the spirit world, but there are alarming effects, especially for Kate. Stepping outside the bounds of Wicca, Kate becomes entranced—so much so her friends fear for her.

===Book 11: The House of Winter===

:&quot;Winter&#x27;s cold and Winter&#x27;s darkness,&quot;
:&quot;wraps us in these frozen hours.&quot; 
:&quot;As the ceaseless wheel turns we call,&quot;
:&quot;the sun to warm us with its power.&quot;

Cooper, Annie, and Kate celebrate the winter solstice in true Wiccan spirit. The threesome joins the practitioners of the Craft in a remote, haunted house in the wintry mountains. An unexpected blizzard strikes, and the girls cannot resist the lure of the dark house&#x27;s shrouded mystery.

===Book 12: Written in the Stars===

:&quot;Ever moving, Ever changing,&quot;
:&quot;stars and planets come and go.&quot;
:&quot;Those who watch their movements say,&quot;
:&quot;As is above, so is below.&quot;

Astrology—the study of the stars—is said to reveal the truth of the universe. Cooper, Kate, and Annie find this to be alarmingly true, and their progress on the Wiccan path is nearly undone by what the stars tell them.

===Book 13: And It Harm None===

:&quot;And it harm none, do as ye will,&quot;
:&quot;so says the ancient wiccan rede.&quot; 
:&quot;Those who do not heed its words will learn&quot;
:&quot;the Power of the Law of Three.&quot;

Annie, Kate, and Cooper uncover what looks like a crime. When they look more closely, it is not. Knowing the Law of Three—that harm comes back to haunt—can they still help a friend in need without paying for it themselves?

===Book 14: The Challenge Box===

:&quot;Reach inside and choose your challenge,&quot;
:&quot;Find the path that you must travel.&quot;
:&quot;What trials have you to over come?&quot;
:&quot;What mysteries shall you unravel?&quot;

Of her circle, Kate has always struggled the most in learning the ways of the Craft. As her Wiccan initiation approaches, a final challenge threatens to overcome her at last.

===Book 15: Initiation===

:&quot;Tonight you take the last step on&quot;
:&quot;of your journey of a year and a day.&quot;
:&quot;Welcome home o new-made witch,&quot;
:&quot;And in our circle rest and stay.&quot;

The joyful culmination of a year and day&#x27;s dedication—Kate, Annie and Cooper&#x27;s Wiccan initiation—brings celebration, an exhilarating ritual, and unexpected choices for the new witches.

<text>Count George Noble Plunkett (3 December 1851 – 12 March 1948) was an Irish nationalist politician, museum director and biographer, who served as Minister for Fine Arts from 1921 to 1922, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1919 to 1921 and Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann in January 1919. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1927. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Roscommon North from 1917 to 1922.

He was the father of Joseph Plunkett, one of the leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916, as well as George Oliver Plunkett, Fiona Plunkett and John (Jack) Plunkett who also fought during the rising and subsequently during the Irish revolutionary period.

==Early life and family==
Plunkett was part of the prominent Irish Norman Plunkett family, which included Saint Oliver Plunkett (1629–1681). George&#x27;s relatives included the Earls of Fingall—his great-grandfather George Plunkett (1750–1824) was &quot;in the sixth degree removed in relationship&quot; (fifth cousin) to the 8th Earl of Fingall—and the Barons of Dunsany, whose line had conformed to the Church of Ireland in the eighteenth century. One of that line, Sir Horace Curzon Plunkett, had served as Unionist MP for South Dublin (1892–1900) but became a convinced Home Rule supporter by 1912 as an alternative to the partition of Ireland, and served as a member of the first Irish Free State Senate (1922–1923).

Born in 1851 at 1 Aungier Street, Dublin, Plunkett was the son of Patrick Joseph Plunkett (1817–1918), a builder, and Elizabeth Noble (Plunkett). The family income allowed Plunkett to attend school in Nice in France, then at Clongowes Wood College and Trinity College Dublin. In Dublin he studied Renaissance and medieval art, among other topics, ultimately graduating in 1884. Plunkett spent much time abroad, primarily in Italy.

===Titles===
In 1884, he was created a Papal Count by Pope Leo XIII for donating money and property to the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary, a Roman Catholic nursing order. He was a Knight Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre.

===Marriage and children===
That year he married Josephine Cranny (1858–1944), and they had seven children: Philomena (Mimi, 1886), Joseph (1887), Moya (Maria, c. 1889), Geraldine (Gerry, c. 1891), George Oliver (1895), Fiona (c. 1896) and John (Jack, c. 1897). From 1907 to 1916, he was curator of the National Museum in Dublin.

==Political career==
===1890s===
Plunkett, a Home Rule supporter for many years, took the Parnellite side when that party split. On their behalf he contested the parliamentary constituencies of Mid Tyrone in 1892 and St. Stephen&#x27;s Green, Dublin in 1895 and 1898 – missing election in the latter contest by just 138 votes.

===1910s===
Plunkett&#x27;s interest in politics likely came mostly through his sons Joseph, George and John, and though it was following the execution of Joseph that he became radicalised, it is likely that Joseph swore him into the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) some time before the Rising. His daughter Fiona, in an RTÉ interview in 1966, described how in the months before the Rising he went to Switzerland on behalf of the IRB leaders to try to make contacts with the Germans. Joseph, George and Jack were all sentenced to death following the Easter Rising, but George and Jack had their sentences commuted to 10 years&#x27; penal servitude, and both were released in 1917. At least two of his daughters, Philomena and Fiona, were involved in preparations for the Rising. He was expelled from the Royal Dublin Society for his sons&#x27; role in the Rising.

Three weeks before the Rising Plunkett was dispatched to the Vatican to seek a private audience with Pope Benedict XV in the hope of getting the Pope&#x27;s blessings. Plunkett reports that the Pope was moved by the religious symbolism of staging the Rising on Easter Sunday and persuaded him to give his &quot;Apostolic Benediction&quot; upon the rebels. When Plunkett once again travelled to the Vatican in 1920 Benedict XV congratulated Plunkett on his cabinet position.

The new politics was indebted to its youth wing&#x27;s vocal support: they gathered in numbers at Carrick railway station to cheer on Plunkett&#x27;s campaign. Amongst the crowds were the women of Cumann na mBan, &quot;a big percentage of youth...large numbers of young men...[and] more curious still for those days, young women.&quot;

On 3 February 1917, running as an independent candidate, Plunkett won the seat of Roscommon North in a by-election. At his victory party in Boyle he announced his decision to abstain from Westminster. He called a Convention in the Mansion House in April 1917, where after some debate it was agreed to set up a &#x27;Council of Nine&#x27; bringing all nationalists together under one banner. He continued to build up the Liberty League Clubs.

The different groups were merged in October 1917, under the newly elected Éamon de Valera, at the Sinn Féin Convention. The League of Women Delegates protested that there were only 12 women out of 1,000 delegates; and only Countess Plunkett on the Council of Nine. It was de Valera&#x27;s genius to adopt a flexibility that incorporated Plunkett and other non-republicans. Their common aim was &quot;an Irish government&quot;. They intended to be active citizens taking part in the nomination of elections.

He was re-elected in the 1918 general election and joined the First Dáil, in which he served briefly as Ceann Comhairle. At the first public session, during a sober address given by Father Michael O&#x27;Flanagan, Plunkett warned the small crowd not to cheer. The Catholicity of the meetings confirmed the divisions to unionist communities.

Nominally Plunkett was given the foreign affairs portfolio, owing to his seniority, but effectively Arthur Griffith conducted policy abroad. De Valera moved him to a Fine Arts portfolio in August 1921, in an effort to create an inner cabinet of only six; so a wholly new ministry was created for the purpose, &quot;giving the appearance of stability and progressiveness to their affairs.&quot; De Valera&#x27;s green modernism marginalized the old nobility, however Catholic and correct.

===1920s to 1930s===
Following the Irish War of Independence, Plunkett joined the anti-treaty side, and continued to support Sinn Féin after the split with Fianna Fáil. He lost his Dáil seat at the June 1927 general election. In a 1936 by-election in the Galway constituency, Plunkett ran as a joint Cumann Poblachta na hÉireann/Sinn Féin candidate. Losing his deposit, he polled only 2,696 votes (2.1%). In 1938, he was one of the former members of the Second Dáil that purported to assign a self-proclaimed residual sovereign power to the IRA, when they signed the statement printed in the 17 December 1938 issue of the &quot;Wolfe Tone Weekly&quot; (see Irish republican legitimism).

While Dáil minister for foreign affairs, Plunkett wrote a lengthy letter to Éamon de Valera warning him not to develop too close a relationship with &quot;the Jews&quot; on the grounds that, among other things, the British press &quot;was largely owned and controlled by Jews&quot;, in Italy, Jews were responsible for the publication of pornography, &quot;for a bad Jew shows his racial hatred of Christians by corrupting them,&quot; and &quot;the dirty and ignorant sufferers from Russia and the Balcaus [sic] make very troublesome immigrants.&quot; However, he also made some positive remarks on Jews: &quot;Their best men show great distinction in music, are fine linguists, Cosmopolitan, sensitive, enthusiastic about art, genial, charitable, clean living (and) generally large-minded and good employers of Christians&quot;.

===Death===
He died on 12 March 1948, at the age of 96 in Dublin.

<doc id="593184" wikidata="Q1753661" url="?curid=593184" title="Lake Placid (film)">
<text>Lake Placid is a 1999 American comedy horror film directed by Steve Miner and written by David E. Kelley. It is the first installment in the &quot;Lake Placid&quot; film series and stars Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Brendan Gleeson, Oliver Platt, Betty White, Meredith Salenger, and Mariska Hargitay. In the film, a giant crocodile terrorizes the fictional location of Black Lake, Maine, while a dysfunctional group of police and scientists attempt to capture or kill the beast.

&quot;Lake Placid&quot; was produced by Fox 2000 Pictures and Stan Winston Studios (which did the special effects for the creatures) and principal photography was shot in British Columbia, Canada. The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox and released in theatres in the United States on July 16, 1999, and in the United Kingdom on March 31, 2000. It grossed $56.9 million worldwide and was followed by five low-budget made-for-television sequels, starting with &quot;Lake Placid 2&quot; in 2007.

== Plot ==

In Aroostook County, Maine, Department of Inland Fisheries &amp; Wildlife officer Walt Lawson is scuba diving with Sheriff Hank Keough in Black Lake when he is suddenly bitten in half by an unknown creature.

United States Fish and Wildlife Service officer Jack Wells, American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Kelly Scott, and Hank investigate the incident. They are joined by Hector Cyr, a wealthy mythology professor and crocodile enthusiast, who suspects the culprit is a crocodile much to the disbelief of the group. After Kelly and Hank&#x27;s canoe is flipped over, they discover a severed human toe and a moose head. Hank&#x27;s deputy, Burke, has his head bitten off, which confirms Hector&#x27;s suspicions, but Hank remains skeptical. That evening, the group makes camp and prepares a plan to capture the creature.

The following day, as Hank and Hector get into an altercation, a large grizzly bear attacks them, but a gigantic long saltwater crocodile emerges from the lake and drags the bear into the water. The group discovers that local resident Delores Bickerman, an elderly widow living near the lake, is feeding the crocodile after they observe her leading a blindfolded dairy cow to the water. She reveals that she had been feeding it for years after the crocodile ate her husband.

Hector and Deputy Sharon Gare take his helicopter onto the lake and unexpectedly land in the crocodile&#x27;s territory. While he is scuba diving, Hector is confronted by the crocodile, but he and Gare escape after distracting it with an inflatable raft. Hank and Jack call in the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for help with killing the crocodile, but Hector suggests that he should lure it out of the water and tranquilize it instead. Jack reluctantly accepts the proposal and they use one of Bickerman&#x27;s cattle, dangled from the helicopter, as bait.

After a few hours, the crocodile appears. Hector pulls up as the crocodile lunges, and Jack fires a tranquilizer dart into its neck. Hector loses control of the helicopter and crashes into the lake. The crocodile comes on land and pursues the group. Kelly is knocked into the lake by the crocodile&#x27;s tail. As Kelly enters the downed helicopter, the crocodile attacks but becomes trapped. As the tranquilizer kicks in and the crocodile appears to be pacified, Jack, Hector, and Hank argue about whether or not to kill it. Jack eventually grabs Hank&#x27;s gun and shoots it, but the firearm turns out to be another tranquilizer. As Hector comes out of the water, another crocodile attacks and bites him, but Hank blows it up with a grenade launcher. Soon after, Florida wildlife officers arrive, they load the neutralized crocodile onto a truck and take it to Portland, Maine as they determine what to do next.

One week later, Bickerman feeds bread crumbs to many baby crocodiles, revealing the two adults were actually a mating pair. The surviving adult crocodile is seen tied to the back of a flatbed trailer travelling down the highway.

The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Betty White&#x27;s delightful supporting turn may be worth the price of admission alone, but &quot;Lake Placid&quot; is swamped by a smarmy script and inability to deliver on the creature feature mayhem&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one out of four stars, describing it as &quot;completely wrong-headed from beginning to end&quot;. He put it on his list of the 10 Worst Films of the Year. Andrew Collins of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, writing that &quot;you can enjoy &quot;Placid&quot; as a straightforward camping-holiday nightmare, or as a sly, ironic take on the same. It works deliciously as both&quot;.

<text>Walter Thomas Varney (December 26, 1888 – January 25, 1967) was an American aviation pioneer who founded forerunners of two major U.S. airlines, United Airlines and Continental Airlines, which combined under United Continental Holdings in 2010, long after his death in 1967.
Varney was also one of the most prominent airmail contractors of the early 20th century.

Varney served as a pilot in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps during World War I. After the war Varney established an aviation school and air taxi service in northern California.

== Aviation career ==
After finishing flight school in 1918, he purchased Lynch Field in Redwood City with the goal of starting a flying school and an air taxi service from San Francisco. In October 1925, Varney was awarded one of the first contracts under the recently passed Contract Air Mail Act after the determination was made the United States Army Air Corps was not suited for air mail flying. He based his operation, Varney Air Service, in Pasco, Washington, and flew routes between Pasco, and Elko, Nevada, stopping in Boise, Idaho each way. Varney&#x27;s first airmail flight took off on April 6, 1926.

Varney, following a five-company merger, sold the much expanded Varney Air Group in 1930 to United Aircraft and Transport. The company&#x27;s name was changed to United Air Lines in 1933.

Continental Airlines was founded in 1934 by Varney and his partner Louis Mueller as Varney Speed Lines. On July 15, 1934, Varney Speed Lines flew its first trip on a 530-mile route from Pueblo, Colorado to El Paso, Texas with stops in Las Vegas, New Mexico, and Santa Fe and Albuquerque New Mexico. Varney ceded control to Mueller in 1934, and in 1936 a controlling interest in the company was sold to Robert Six who renamed it Continental Airlines in 1937, moving its headquarters to Denver.

In 1932, Varney contributed half of the $40,000 needed to purchase the Lockheed division of Detroit Aircraft Corporation out of bankruptcy. The company was reorganized in Burbank, California as the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. Varney retired from that company in 1951.

== Later years and death ==
In his later years, Varney suffered from chronic pulmonary emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and valvular heart disease. He lived for a time with the family of his son-in-law, Richard Lambert. He died of bronchial pneumonia on Jan. 25, 1967 at Dani&#x27;s Nursing Home in Santa Barbara, California. He was buried in Cypress Lawn Memorial Park in Colma, California in the Varney family plot.

<text>Geoffrey Daniel Prosser (born 6 November 1948) is an Australian businessman and former politician. He served in the House of Representatives from 1987 to 2007, representing the Liberal Party, and was Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs in the Howard government from 1996 to 1997.

==Early life==
Prosser was born in Bunbury, Western Australia, and was a self-employed businessman and company director before entering politics. He was a member of the Bunbury City Council 1979–85.

==Federal Parliament==
Prosser was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry from 1990 to 1996. After the Liberal Party&#x27;s election at the March 1996 election, he was appointed Small Business and Consumer Affairs in the Howard ministry.

On the basis of Liberal prime minister John Howard&#x27;s 1996 Guide on Key Elements of Ministerial Behaviour, Prosser was forced to return to the backbench July 1997 because of improper business dealings. He continued to be a major retail landlord, and this was seen to conflict with his responsibilities as Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs.

Prosser was believed to have been one of the wealthiest members of the House, if not &quot;the&quot; wealthiest, during his time as the member for Forrest. In 2010 his estimated net worth was $186 million.

On Saturday, 3 March 2007 The Australian newspaper published allegations made by former Western Australia Premier Brian Burke that Prosser was a client of his and that Prosser had paid for lobbying services. The paper also alleged that Prosser was recently seen dining with Julian Grill, Burke&#x27;s business partner.

Prosser retired from parliament at the 2007 federal election.

==Later activities==
In August 2011 he was elected president of the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party, succeeding Barry Court.

<doc id="593203" wikidata="Q21111297" url="?curid=593203" title="Dicer">
<text>Dicer, also known as endoribonuclease Dicer or helicase with RNase motif, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the gene. Being part of the RNase III family, Dicer cleaves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and pre-microRNA (pre-miRNA) into short double-stranded RNA fragments called small interfering RNA and microRNA, respectively. These fragments are approximately 20–25 base pairs long with a two-base overhang on the 3′-end. Dicer facilitates the activation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is essential for RNA interference. RISC has a catalytic component Argonaute, which is an endonuclease capable of degrading messenger RNA (mRNA). 

== Discovery ==

Dicer was given its name in 2001 by Stony Brook PhD student Emily Bernstein while conducting research in Gregory Hannon&#x27;s lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Bernstein sought to discover the enzyme responsible for generating small RNA fragments from double-stranded RNA. Dicer&#x27;s ability to generate around 22 nucleotide RNA fragments was discovered by separating it from the RISC enzyme complex after initiating the RNAi pathway with dsRNA transfection. This experiment showed that RISC was not responsible for generating the observable small nucleotide fragments. Subsequent experiments testing RNase III family enzymes abilities to create RNA fragments narrowed the search to &quot;Drosophila&quot; CG4792, now named Dicer.

Dicer orthologs are present in many other organisms. In the moss &quot;Physcomitrella patens&quot; DCL1b, one of four DICER proteins, is not involved in miRNA biogenesis but in dicing miRNA target transcripts. Thus, a novel mechanism for regulation of gene expression, the epigenetic silencing of genes by miRNAs, was discovered.

In terms of crystal structure, the first Dicer to be explored was that from the protozoan &quot;Giardia intestinalis&quot;. The work was done by Ian MacRae while conducting research as a postdoctoral fellow in Jennifer Doudna&#x27;s lab at the University of California, Berkeley. A PAZ domain and two RNase III domains were discovered by X-ray crystallography. The protein size is 82 kDa, representing the conserved functional core that has subsequently been found in larger Dicer proteins in other organisms; for example, it is 219 kDa in humans. The difference in size from humans to &quot;G. intestinalis&quot; Dicer is due to at least five different domains being present within human Dicer. These domains are important in Dicer activity regulation, dsRNA processing, and RNA interference protein factor functioning.

== Functional domains ==
Human dicer (also known as hsDicer or DICER1) is classified a Ribonuclease III because it cleaves double-stranded RNA. In addition to two RNaseIII domains, it contains a helicase domain, a PAZ (Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille) domain, and two double stranded RNA binding domains (DUF283 and dsRBD).

Current research suggests the PAZ domain is capable of binding the 2 nucleotide 3&#x27; overhang of dsRNA while the RNaseIII catalytic domains form a pseudo-dimer around the dsRNA to initiate cleavage of the strands. This results in a functional shortening of the dsRNA strand. The distance between the PAZ and RNaseIII domains is determined by the angle of the connector helix and influences the length of the micro RNA product. The dsRBD domain binds the dsRNA, although the specific binding site of the domain has not been defined. It is possible that this domain works as part of a complex with other regulator proteins (TRBP in humans, R2D2, Loqs in &quot;Drosophila&quot;) in order to effectively position the RNaseIII domains and thus control the specificity of the sRNA products. The helicase domain has been implicated in processing long substrates.

== Role in RNA interference ==

===Micro RNA===
RNA interference is a process where the breakdown of RNA molecules into miRNA inhibits gene expression of specific host mRNA sequences. miRNA is produced within the cell starting from primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) in the nucleus. These long sequences are cleaved into smaller precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which are usually 70 nucleotides with a hairpin structure. Pri-miRNA are identified by DGCR8 and cleaved by Drosha to form the pre-miRNA, a process that occurs in the nucleus. These pre-miRNA are then exported to the cytoplasm, where they are cleaved by Dicer to form mature miRNA.

===Small Interfering RNA===
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) are produced and function in a similar manner to miRNA by cleaving double-stranded RNA with Dicer into smaller fragments, 21 to 23 nucleotides in length. Both miRNAs and siRNAs activate the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which finds the complementary target mRNA sequence and cleaves the RNA using RNase. This in turn silences the particular gene by RNA interference. siRNAs and miRNAs differ in the fact that siRNAs are typically specific to the mRNA sequence while miRNAs aren&#x27;t completely complementary to the mRNA sequence. miRNAs can interact with targets that have similar sequences, which inhibits translation of different genes. In general, RNA interference is an essential part of normal processes within organisms such as humans, and it is an area being researched as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for cancer targets.

== Disease ==

=== Macular degeneration ===

Age related macular degeneration is a prominent cause of blindness in developed countries. Dicer&#x27;s role in this disease became apparent after it was discovered that affected patients showed decreased levels of Dicer in their retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Mice with Dicer knocked out, lacking Dicer only in their RPE, exhibited similar symptoms. However, other mice lacking important RNAi pathway proteins like Drosha and Pasha, did not have symptoms of macular degeneration as Dicer-knockout mice. This observation suggested a Dicer specific role in retinal health that was independent of the RNAi pathway and thus not a function of si/miRNA generation. A form of RNA called Alu RNA (the RNA transcripts of alu elements)) was found to be elevated in patients with insufficient Dicer levels. These non coding strands of RNA can loop forming dsRNA structures that would be degraded by Dicer in a healthy retina. However, with insufficient Dicer levels, the accumulation of alu RNA leads to the degeneration of RPE as a result of inflammation.

=== Cancer ===

Altered miRNA expression profiles in malignant cancers suggest a pivotal role of miRNA and thus dicer in cancer development and prognosis. miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors and therefore their altered expression may result in tumorigenesis. In analysis of lung and ovarian cancer, poor prognosis and decreased patient survival times correlate with decreased dicer and drosha expression. Decreased dicer mRNA levels correlate with advanced tumor stage. However, high dicer expression in other cancers, like prostate and esophageal, has been shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis. This discrepancy between cancer types suggests unique RNAi regulatory processes involving dicer differ amongst different tumor types.

Dicer is also involved in DNA repair. DNA damage increases in mammalian cells with decreased Dicer expression as a result of decreased efficiency of DNA damage repair and other mechanisms. For example, siRNA from double strand breaks (produced by Dicer) may act as guides for protein complexes involved in the double strand break repair mechanisms and can also direct chromatin modifications. Additionally, miRNAs expression patterns change as a result of DNA damage caused by ionizing or ultraviolet radiation. RNAi mechanisms are responsible for transposon silencing and in their absence, as when Dicer is knocked out/down, can lead to activated transposons that cause DNA damage. Accumulation of DNA damage may result in cells with oncogenic mutations and thus the development of a tumor.

=== Other conditions ===

Multinodular goiter with schwannomatosis has been shown to be an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutations in this gene.

=== Viral pathogenesis ===

Infection by RNA viruses can trigger the RNAi cascade. It is likely dicer is involved in viral immunity as viruses that infect both plant and animal cells contain proteins designed to inhibit the RNAi response. In humans, the viruses HIV-1, influenza, and vaccinia encode such RNAi suppressing proteins. Inhibition of dicer is beneficial to the virus as dicer is able to cleave viral dsRNA and load the product onto RISC resulting in targeted degradation of viral mRNA; thus fighting the infection. Another potential mechanism for viral pathogenesis is the blockade of dicer as a way to inhibit cellular miRNA pathways.

=== In insects ===

In &quot;Drosophila&quot;, Dicer-1 generates microRNAs (miRNAs) by processing pre-miRNA, Dicer-2 is responsible for producing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Insects can use Dicer as a potent antiviral. This finding is especially significant given that mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of many viral diseases including the potentially deadly arboviruses: West Nile virus, dengue fever and yellow fever. While mosquitoes, more specifically the &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; species, serve as the vectors for these viruses, they are not the intended host of the virus. Transmission occurs as a result of the female mosquito&#x27;s need for vertebrate blood to develop her eggs. The RNAi pathway in insects is very similar to that of other animals; Dicer-2 cleaves viral RNA and loads it onto the RISC complex where one strand serves as a template for the production of RNAi products and the other is degraded. Insects with mutations leading to non-functional components of their RNAi pathway show increased viral loads for viruses they carry or increased susceptibility to viruses for which they are hosts. Similarly to humans, insect viruses have evolved mechanisms to avoid the RNAi pathway. As an example, &quot;Drosophila C&quot; virus encodes for protein 1A which binds to dsRNA thus protecting it from dicer cleavage as well as RISC loading. &quot;Heliothis virescens&quot; ascovirus 3a encodes an RNase III enzyme similar to the RNase III domains of dicer which may compete for dsRNA substrate as well as degrade siRNA duplexes to prevent RISC loading.

==Diagnostic and therapeutic applications==

Dicer can be used to identify whether tumors are present within the body based on the expression level of the enzyme. A study showed that many patients that had cancer had decreased expression levels of Dicer. The same study showed that lower Dicer expression correlated with lower patient survival length. Along with being a diagnostic tool, Dicer can be used for treating patients by injecting foreign siRNA intravenously to cause gene silencing.

The siRNA was shown to be delivered in two ways in mammalian species such as mice. One way would be to directly inject into the system, which would not require Dicer function. Another way would be to introduce it by plasmids that encode for short hairpin RNA, which are cleaved by Dicer into siRNA.

One of the advantages of using Dicer to produce siRNA therapeutically would be the specificity and diversity of targets it can affect compared to what is currently being used such as antibodies or small molecular inhibitors. In general, small molecular inhibitors are difficult in terms of specificity along with unendurable side effects. Antibodies are as specific as siRNA, but it is limited by only being able to be used against ligands or surface receptors. On the other hand, low efficiency of intracellular uptake is the main obstacle of injection of siRNA. Injected SiRNA has poor stability in blood and causes stimulations of non-specific immunity. Also, producing miRNA therapeutically lacks in specificity because only 6-8 nucleotide base pairing is required for miRNA to attach to mRNA.

==Dicer-like proteins==
Plant genomes encode for dicer-like proteins with similar functions and protein domains as animal and insect dicer. For example, in the model organism &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, four dicer like proteins are made and are designated DCL1 to DCL4. DCL1 is involved with miRNA generation and sRNA production from inverted repeats. DCL2 creates siRNA from cis-acting antisense transcripts which aid in viral immunity and defense. DCL3 generates siRNA which aids in chromatin modification and DCL4 is involved in trans-acting siRNA metabolism and transcript silencing at the post-transcriptional level. Additionally, DCL 1 and 3 are important for &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; flowering. In &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, DCL knockout does not cause severe developmental problems.

Rice and grapes also produce DCLs as the dicer mechanism is a common defense strategy of many organisms. Rice has evolved other functions for the five DCLs it produces and they play a more important role in function and development than in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;. Additionally, expression patterns differ among the different plant cell types of rice while expression in &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; is more homogeneous. Rice DCL expression can be affected by biological stress conditions, including drought, salinity and cold. Thus these stressors may decrease a plant&#x27;s viral resistance. Unlike &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, loss of function of DCL proteins causes developmental defects in rice.

<text>USS &quot;Lyon&quot; (AP-71) was a type C3 ship of the United States Navy which played an extensive role in naval transportation during World War II. The &quot;Lyon&quot; was built as Mormactide under a Maritime Commission (MC) contract by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Company of Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was laid down 21 August 1939, and was launched on 12 October 1940; sponsored by Gloria McGehee.

&quot;Mormactide&quot; was the third ship to be built by Ingalls for Moore-McCormack Lines and was designed specifically for the South American trade. The ship was completed in April 1941 and turned over to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for wartime operation in March 1942 when it was operated by Moore-McCormack for the WSA under a United States Army Transportation Corps agreement. In August the ship was transferred to the Custody of the War Department. On 20 August 1942 the ship was acquired by the Navy and was renamed the &quot;Lyon&quot; after Mary Lyon, the founder of Mount Holyoke College (then &quot;Mount Holyoke Female Seminary&quot;). (See also List of U.S. military vessels named after women.)

The &quot;Lyon&quot; was transferred for conversion to the Atlantic Basin Iron Works of Brooklyn, New York on 13 September 1942. The ship was commissioned on 16 September 1942. After the ship&#x27;s service in World War II, the ship was decommissioned on 3 May 1946, and was returned to her owners, Moore-McCormack Lines. In 1966 the ship was acquired by Grace Lines and renamed the &quot;Santa Regina&quot;.

==Pre-World War II==
&quot;Mormactide&quot; was the second ship designed for Moore-McCormack&#x27;s South American trade equipped with a cargo air conditioning system and the third ship to be built by Ingalls for the line. The ship, a MC type C3 hull numbered 65, Ingalls hull 255 was assigned official number 240348 and completed on 10 April 1941. &quot;Mormactide&quot; was turned over to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) for wartime operation on 10 March 1942. &quot;Mormactide&quot; was operated by Moore-McCormack for WSA under a standard Army Transportation Corps agreement until 8 August 1942 when the ship was transferred to the Custody of the War Department. On 13 September 1942 the Navy acquired &quot;Mormactide&quot; under a bareboat charter from WSA.

==World War II==
After being turned over to the Navy, she completed conversion to an AP, ship, on 20 September 1942. The &quot;Lyon&quot; departed from Newport News, Virginia on 22 October 1942 to assist in the invasion of French Morocco, taking part in the largest assembly of ships ever assembled at the time. The &quot;Lyon&quot; safely crossed the Atlantic Ocean, encountering none of the U-boats which were a major danger at the time. The ship arrived at Safi on 7 November.

While ships of the western task force of Operation Torch silenced French shore batteries and naval resistance, troops of the western pincer were landed to trap the retreating Afrika Korps of General Erwin Rommel, the &quot;Desert Fox&quot;. Though a cease-fire was negotiated on 11 November, German U-boats interfered, and torpedo attacks began 10 November. Since the 15 transports and cargo ships anchored in Fedhala Roads offered a target, they were removed to the security of Casablanca. The &quot;Lyon&quot; was part of a convoy that sailed for the United States on 15 November, and arrived back in Norfolk on 24 November.

From 13 December 1942 to 11 March 1943, &quot;Lyon&quot; made two voyages between New York City and Oran, Algeria, transporting reinforcements for the campaign in North Africa. The ship was then ordered to duty with Atlantic Amphibious Force for several weeks, and returned to Africa on 23 May to participate in amphibious training exercises until 28 June.

&quot;Lyon&quot; next departed Mers el Kebir, Algiers on 6 July, with units of the Army&#x27;s 1st Infantry Division for the assault on Gela, Sicily. The troops on the &quot;Lyon&quot; disembarked safely in stormy weather on 10 July for the initial advance into what had been called Europe&#x27;s &quot;soft underbelly&quot;. The vessel sailed from the battle area on 12 July and arrived back in Algeria three days later to prepare for the next assignment, the Salerno landings.

Operation Avalanche was launched on 9 September. The landings were successful despite heavy enemy fire, air attacks, and complications resulting from a false report of Italy&#x27;s surrender. The &quot;Lyon&quot; returned to Oran on 14 September and for the next two months reinforced American forces fighting in the Naples area. The ship departed the Mediterranean Sea on 7 November and arrived in New York City on 21 November for overhaul.

In January 1944, the &quot;Lyon&quot; transported 2,000 Army Air Corps and Army Medical Corps personnel to Scotland, returning to New York City on 28 January. The &quot;Lyon&quot; then departed for North Africa via England, making two voyages to Naples before beginning five months of training.

She sailed from Naples on 13 August as part of a combined British-French-United States operation to land in the St. Tropez area of southern France. &quot;Lyon&quot; received her fourth battle star here where the Allied landings overwhelmed opposition at this &quot;back door&quot; to Europe. The ship continued to reinforce these landings until 24 October when she again departed for New York.

Arriving 8 November, she prepared for Pacific duty, and sailed from New York on 26 December. &quot;Lyon&quot; embarked combat forces in San Francisco in January 1945, and departed for the invasion of Okinawa.

&quot;Lyon&quot; successfully completed her role in this major attack in the face of kamikaze attacks, and returned to San Francisco on 21 May. She departed Seattle, Washington, on 2 June to reinforce Okinawa, sailing via Honolulu, Eniwetok, and Ulithi. &quot;Lyon&quot; arrived off Okinawa on 14 July and was immediately forced out to sea by a typhoon. For two days her convoy was exposed to enemy submarine and kamikaze attacks, but the proximity of Admiral William Halsey, Jr.&#x27;s 3rd Fleet diverted potential attackers. She returned to Okinawa on 21 July and embarked veteran marines bound for Guam to prepare for the planned assault on the Japanese home islands. She returned to the west coast on 14 August.

&quot;Lyon&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

==After World War II==
After two voyages to the Far East between August and November transporting occupation troops and returning veterans, &quot;Lyon&quot; arrived in San Francisco on 3 February 1946. She departed Oakland, California, on 2 March with 1,000 German prisoners of war bound for Liverpool, England, and returned to New York on 12 April. She decommissioned on 3 May 1946 and was returned to her owners, the Moore-McCormack Lines, and her original name.

On 3 May 1946 the ship returned to operation by Moore-McCormack under a WSA agreement as &quot;Mormactide&quot; until 6 November when the ship was redelivered to the line. The ship remained under the ownership of Moore-McCormack Lines until August 1966 when she was sold to Grace Lines and renamed Santa Regina. On 18 January the ship was sold by the then Prudential-Grace Lines to Dah Young Steel Manufacturing Co., LTD for scrapping in Taiwan.

<text>Thatcham is a market town and civil parish in West Berkshire, England. It is situated in the valley of the River Kennet east of Newbury, west of Reading and west of London. The town has a long history dating back to prehistoric times, a claimant to the title of oldest continuously inhabited place in Great Britain. As of 2021, it had a population of 25,464, though it is part of a built-up area comprising itself and neighbouring Newbury of over 70,000 residents. It is on the route of the A4 Bath Road, the historic main road between London and Bristol.

==Geography==
Thatcham straddles the River Kennet, the Kennet and Avon Canal and the A4. The parish currently covers the town of Thatcham, with its suburbs of Henwick, Dunston Park and Colthrop, and the village of Crookham including Crookham Common and the eastern ranges of the old RAF Greenham Common airfield. The historic parish once also covered Midgham, Cold Ash, Ashmore Green and Greenham. Thatcham Reed Beds, just to the south of the town, is a site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

==Etymology==
The name may have been derived from that of a Saxon chief called &quot;Tace&quot; (or perhaps &quot;Tac&quot; or &quot;Tec&quot;), who established a village in around 500 AD. The settlement might have been known as &quot;Taceham&quot; - &quot;ham&quot; meaning village in Saxon. However, some of the earliest written references, in c.951 and c.975, records it as Thaecham. The Thaec comes from the Saxon &quot;þæc&quot; or &quot;thaec&quot; meaning roof-covering and the ham has been speculated to be a shortened hamm which would mean a river meadow.

==History==
The area has evidence of occupation dating from prehistoric times and was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the strongest claimant to being the oldest continuously inhabited place in Britain. The well-preserved remains of a mesolithic settlement, dating from 8400 to 7700 BCE, have been found in its vicinity. Evidence also exists of Bronze and Iron Age settlements and of Romano-British activity.
In the Domesday Book of 1086, following the Norman Conquest, the name had altered slightly to &quot;Taceham&quot; before going through several minor changes until the current form was adopted in the 16th century. The town had a period of great prosperity around 1304, when the Chapel of St. Thomas the Martyr on the A4, now called the Old Bluecoat School, was granted permission to hold services. At that time the population was larger than that of Newbury. The chapel is a Grade I listed building. There is a Norman parish church of St. Mary, which was largely reconstructed in 1857. This is believed to be built on the same site as an earlier Anglo-Saxon church. It was previously known as St. Luke&#x27;s. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

In 1121, Henry I founded Reading Abbey and endowed it with many gifts of land, including the Manor of Thatcham. At the same time Thatcham Hundred ceased to exist: the western part was transferred to Faircross Hundred, and the remainder to the Hundred of Reading. In 1141 Thatcham church, previously the property of the Diocese of Salisbury, was granted to Reading Abbey by the Empress Matilda, who at the same time confirmed her father&#x27;s gift of the manor to the abbey.

During World War II, Thatcham housed one of the biggest Prisoner of War camps in the South, known as camp 1001. Thatcham&#x27;s population grew rapidly in the second half of the 20th century: from 5,000 in 1951 and 7,500 in 1961 to 22,824 in 2001.

===Floods===

On 20 July 2007 parts of Thatcham were flooded during a period of sustained heavy rain, during which three times the average July monthly rainfall hit the town in just 24 hours. While the rivers did not flood, the quantity of water flowing down the hills from Cold Ash and Bucklebury made many roads impassable and stranded hundreds of pupils at Kennet School who tried to wade with rope across Stoney Lane. About 1,100 properties were affected; many residents moved out into mobile homes.

==Institutions==
===Schools===
Although there are many primary schools in the area, the only secondary school in Thatcham is the Kennet School.

===Motor Insurers&#x27; Automotive Research Centre===
The motor insurers&#x27; automotive research centre is located at Colthrop. The &#x27;Thatcham categories&#x27; issued there are the industry standard for vehicle immobilisers and alarms.

===International Seismological Centre===
The International Seismological Centre, an organisation for the final collection, definitive analysis and publication of global seismicity, is located in Pipers Lane, Thatcham.

==Transport==
 railway station is on the Reading to Taunton line, with regular services between and and between and , operated by Great Western Railway. The main east–west road through the town is the A4 Bath Road, which runs between London and Bristol. This road has been superseded as a long-distance route by the M4 motorway which runs almost parallel to the A4, about to the north. The closest junction to the town is the Chieveley interchange at Junction 13.

==Sports and leisure==

Thatcham is home to non-league football club Thatcham Town, who play their matches at Waterside Park, south of the Thatcham railway station. The club reached the final of the FA Vase in the 2017–18 season, becoming the first Berkshire side to reach a national cup final. Thatcham Town Cricket Club is based at a ground on Brownsfield Road, next to the council offices. The Henwick Worthy Sports Ground is the home of the Newbury and Thatcham Hockey Club and the Thatcham Rugby Union Football Club, and plays host to a number of amateur and youth sports.

==Governance==
The town is divided into four wards for West Berkshire Council elections: Thatcham Central, Thatcham North, Thatcham South &amp; Crookham and Thatcham West. Seven councillors represent Thatcham on the West Berkshire Council with the Liberal Democrats having five, and the Conservatives having two. These wards are used in town council elections, with fourteen Liberal Democrats, three Conservatives, and one Green Party member sitting on the town council. At national level it is represented, since 2024, by the Liberal Democrat MP for Newbury, Lee Dillon.

===Town twinning===
Thatcham is twinned with Nideggen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Demography==
Local employment is chiefly in light industrial premises, sales and distribution, retail and public sectors.

<text>Joseph Albert Albertson (October 17, 1906 – January 20, 1993) was an American entrepreneur and founder of the [[Albertsons]] grocery store chain, one of the largest food and drug retailers in the United States.

==Early life==
Born in Yukon, Oklahoma Territory, Albertson was one of four sons born to Rhoda and Earl Albertson. In 1909, the family moved west to Caldwell, Idaho.

After graduation from Caldwell High School in 1925, Albertson studied business for two years at the College of Idaho in Caldwell.

==Career==
While in college in 1927, he worked as a clerk at a local Safeway grocery store. On the final day of 1929, he married his college classmate, Kathryn McCurry, of Boise, Idaho. They had one daughter, Barbara Jean Albertson Newman (1933–2012).

By 1939 Albertson was supervising more than a dozen stores. Wanting to start his own store, Albertson took $5,000 of his own money and $7,500 borrowed from his wife&#x27;s aunt to open his first Albertsons grocery store in partnership with L.S. Skaggs, a former Safeway division manager, and Tom Cuthbert, Skaggs&#x27;s accountant. The store, at Sixteenth and State Streets in Boise, had an automated donut machine and one of the first magzine racks in the USA.

Albertson opened his second and third Albertsons stores in Nampa and Caldwell in 1940. During the years of World War II, when food was being rationed, he filled empty shelves with health and beauty products, general household goods, and other non-food items. His stores promoted war bonds and sponsored scrap drives that collected aluminum, steel, fats, and paper for recycling.

In 1945, the partneship with Skaggs was disbanded and Albertsons founded. Albertson would be chairman of the board until 1976, when he stepped down at age 70. By which time the company had grown to over 300 stores and $1 billion in annual sales.

==J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation==
In 1966, Joe and Kathryn established the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation as a way to administer their charitable giving. The foundation focuses on giving primarily to education, personally important as Joe and Kathryn were both unable able to finish college during the Great Depression. Since then, the foundation has given more than $750 million to Idaho&#x27;s communities. The foundation continues to give in areas where Joe and Kathryn lived or worked in Idaho. They are committed to accelerating opportunities in Idaho and focus on initiative work that is related to learning, leadership, and community.

Albertson donated over $72 million to the College of Idaho. For their gratitude, the college changed its name to the Albertson College of Idaho from 1991 to 2007. The Kathryn Albertson Park in Boise, with its winding walkways, wildflowers, trees and ponds was gifted to the citizens of Idaho.

<text>A twip (abbreviating &quot;twentieth of a point&quot; or &quot;twentieth of an inch point&quot;) is a typographical measurement, defined as of a typographical point. One twip is  inch, or 17.64 μm.

== In computing ==
Twips are screen-independent units to ensure that the proportion of screen elements are the same on all display systems. A twip is defined as being of an inch (approximately 17.64 μm).

A pixel is a screen-dependent unit, standing for &#x27;picture element&#x27;. A pixel is a dot that represents the smallest graphical measurement on a screen.
Twips are the default unit of measurement in Visual Basic (version 6 and earlier, prior to VB.NET). Converting between twips and screen pixels is achieved using the TwipsPerPixelX and TwipsPerPixelY properties or the ScaleX and ScaleY methods.

Twips can be used with Symbian OS bitmap images for automatic scaling from bitmap pixels to device pixels. They are also used in Rich Text Format from Microsoft for platform-independent exchange and they are the base length unit in OpenOffice.org and its fork LibreOffice.

Flash internally specifies most sizes in units it calls twips, but which are really of a logical pixel, which is of an actual twip.

<doc id="593214" wikidata="Q696603" url="?curid=593214" title="Steyr Scout">
<text>The Steyr Scout () is an Austrian bolt-action rifle manufactured by Steyr Mannlicher, and chambered primarily for 7.62 NATO (.308 Winchester), although other caliber options in 5.56×45mm NATO (.223 Remington), .243 Winchester, 6.5 Creedmoor, .376 Steyr and 7mm-08 Remington are also offered commercially. It is intended to fill the role of a versatile, lightweight all-around rifle as specified in Jeff Cooper&#x27;s scout rifle concept. Apart from the barrel and action, the gun is made primarily of polymers and is designed to be accurate to at least .

==Design==
The Steyr Scout has the following features:
* Removable box magazines with a magazine cut-off, individual rounds can be manually loaded through the ejection port, allowing for the magazine to be kept in reserve.
* Second spare magazine stored in the butt of the rifle.
* Light weight due to aluminium receiver housing, hammer forged fluted barrel, and extensive use of polymers.
* Top integral Weaver rail.
* Bottom UIT rail at the forend.
* Roller tang safety with &quot;Locked Safe&quot;, &quot;Loading&quot; and &quot;Fire&quot; positions.
* Bolt handle locks downward against receiver in &quot;Locked Safe&quot; mode.
* User-adjustable trigger, factory set at .
* Reserve flip-up &quot;ghost ring&quot; iron sights.
* Integral folding bipod.
* Third attachment point for a &quot;Ching sling&quot;.

There were early reports of problems with the Steyr Scout rifle relating to breakage of the bipod pivot pin. The affected part was subsequently redesigned to improve its strength. Some shooters complained that the bipod was too tall.

The Weaver rail above the action and barrel allows either for conventional positioning of a scope with normal 1.5–3.5 in eye relief or for the forward placement of an intermediate/long eye relief &quot;scout scope&quot;. The latter is more faithful to Cooper&#x27;s Scout concept, and the Steyr-Mannlicher rifle can be ordered from the factory with a low-magnification Leupold scope with long eye relief.

In January, 2015, Steyr Arms announced that a limited edition Steyr Camo Scout would be available in 3 variations of hydro-dipped camouflage due to customer demand.

== Variants ==
=== Steyr Elite ===

A sniper rifle variant and effectively the successor of the Scout is the Steyr Elite (previously known as the Steyr Tactical Elite), a more robustly constructed model with many of the same features of the Scout, but designed primarily for the law enforcement market for an urban tactical role. Differences to the standard Scout include an extended STANAG type mounting rail, an enlarged bolt knob of the SSG type, an adjustable cheek piece, and a height-adjustable buttpad. It is fitted with a heavy barrel, and can produce high muzzle velocities due to a &quot;fast&quot; internal profile. The additional features of the Elite give it a weight of over , which makes it fall outside the definition of a scout rifle. Although intended for intermediate ranges, with match grade 7.62 mm (.308 inch) ammunition and 10.0 g (155 grain) projectiles, entirely acceptable performance at up to has been recorded, making it a good all-rounder. It is standard with a synthetic 5-round magazine, but an external adaptor kit can be attached to fit a 10-round magazine (not available on 5.56 NATO). It is normally available in two calibers; 5.56 NATO and 7.62 NATO, but can be specially ordered in 7 mm-08 Remington upon request.

=== Steyr Scout RFR ===
Also referred to as the Scout Survival, the Scout RFR is the rimfire version of the Scout, with three caliber choices of .17 HMR, .22 LR and .22 WMR. It is a new addition to the lineup, formally introduced in the 2017 SHOT Show. The RFR has an ISSC SPA-style &quot;toggle&quot; straight-pull action and a UNF 1/2&quot;-20 threaded (except the .22 WMR version) heavy blued barrel, with an overall rifle length of and weighing . It comes with a 10-round metal box magazine, and an optional survival knife that can be hidden in the storage cavity in the buttstock. It has a full-length Picatinny rail over the handguard in front of the receiver, which has dovetail grooves but includes two Weaver-style adaptor bases for mounting optics. Unlike the centerfire models, which have three attachment points for using Ching slings, the RFR only has two attachment points for using conventional slings.
