<text>The Philadelphia Phantoms were a professional ice hockey team that played in the American Hockey League (AHL) from 1996 to 2009. The club was based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and played most of its home games at the Spectrum. During schedule conflicts or some Calder Cup playoff games, games were moved to the adjacent Wachovia Center. The Phantoms won two Calder Cup titles (1998 and 2005) during their tenure in Philadelphia.

In anticipation of the planned closure and demolition of the Spectrum, the franchise was sold in early 2009. The new owners moved the club to Glens Falls, New York, for the 2009–10 season and renamed them the Adirondack Phantoms. Beginning in the 2014–15 season, the team moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, in a new 8,500-seat arena, the PPL Center.

==History==
The Phantoms were the fourth AHL franchise to call Philadelphia home, following the Ramblers/Rockets (1936–1942), Rockets (1946–1949), and Firebirds (1977–1979).

===Predecessor AHL clubs in Philadelphia===

When the Canadian–American Hockey League (1926–36) and original International Hockey League (1929–36) began playing an interlocking schedule in 1936–37 as the International-American Hockey League, the then defending &quot;Can-Am&quot; champion Philadelphia Ramblers (&quot;née&quot; Philadelphia Arrows) became one of the new combined circuit&#x27;s eight original member clubs. After two seasons of interlocking play, the two leagues formally merged on June 28, 1938, and the circuit renamed itself the American Hockey League in 1940. By 1942, however, that original Philadelphia franchise (which was renamed the &quot;Rockets&quot; in 1941 after losing its affiliation with the New York Rangers) fell on hard times and permanently suspended operations.

The AHL&#x27;s next two tries in Philadelphia were made in 1946 by a new Philadelphia Rockets (1946–49) and again in 1977 by the NAHL refugee Philadelphia Firebirds (1977–1979), but neither team met with much longevity or on-ice success. The 1946–47 Rockets in fact still hold the AHL mark for fewest wins in a season at five on a record of 5–52–7. The AHL&#x27;s dismal record in the city all changed, however, with the establishment in 1996 of a fourth AHL club in the city, the Phantoms, which went on to win a pair of Calder Cup titles (1998, 2005) during its thirteen-season run.

===The Flyers bring the AHL back to Philadelphia===
For the 12 seasons (1984–96) prior to the Phantoms&#x27; founding, the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Philadelphia Flyers had maintained a highly-successful affiliation with the AHL&#x27;s oldest franchise, the Hershey Bears, which included a Calder Cup title in 1988. In September 1996, however, the Flyers left their long-time home arena, the Spectrum, and moved across the parking lot into the soon-to-be-completed CoreStates Center. Instead of demolishing the Spectrum, Comcast Spectacor, the owner of both arenas as well as the Flyers, elected to keep it open and active, but doing so would require a tenant to fill the 80 to 100 NHL and National Basketball Association (NBA) dates the Spectrum would lose to the CoreStates Center.

To help achieve this end, the Flyers purchased an AHL expansion franchise in December 1995 which would begin operation in the 1996–97 season. A few weeks later, it was announced that the new team would be named the Philadelphia Phantoms and be coached by Hall of Famer and former Flyer winger Bill Barber, assisted by veteran ex-Bear and Flyer defenseman Mike Stothers. This was the same tandem who were then coaching the Flyers&#x27; prospects in Hershey.

===Early success===
The Phantoms played their first ever regular season game on October 4, 1996, defeating the Springfield Falcons 6–3 in Springfield. The franchise&#x27;s first goal was scored by defenseman John Stevens, the team&#x27;s first captain (who had, coincidentally, scored the first goal in Falcons&#x27; history as that team&#x27;s first captain). The club made its Spectrum debut two days later on October 6 before an enthusiastic crowd of 9,166 which saw them defeat the visiting Rochester Americans 3–1 in the first regular season AHL game played in Philadelphia since the departure of the Philadelphia Firebirds in 1979. By season&#x27;s end, the Phantoms had compiled a 49–18–3–10 record for a League-best 111 points, ten more than second overall Hershey&#x27;s 101. Center Peter White captured the Sollenberger Trophy as the AHL&#x27;s top scorer with 105 points while center Vaclav Prospal finished fourth overall in the League with 95 despite having been called up to the Flyers with 17 games left in the season.

After sweeping aside the Baltimore Bandits in three games in the opening round of their first-ever playoffs, the Phantoms then met their now already archrivals, the Hershey Bears, in a most eventful best-of-seven second round set. After dropping the opening game 5–3, the Phantoms evened the series with a 7–4 victory in a most memorable Game 2 which featured, among other things, 350 minutes in penalties (171 to the Phantoms), 14 game misconducts, a pair of suspensions, a one-sided fight in which goaltender Neil Little knocked-out Bears&#x27; backup goaltender Sinuhe Wallinheimo and, most unusual of all, the appearance in the game of no less than five goalies (Jean-Francois Labbe, Wallinheimo and Sylvain Rodrigue for Hershey; Little and Dominic Roussel for Philadelphia). After dropping Game 6, 3–2, in a marathon affair at Hershey that ended when Blair Atcheynum slipped the Bears&#x27; 57th shot of the night (and the 121st overall by both teams) behind Little on a breakaway at :42 of the third overtime, the Phantoms&#x27; first season came to an end when Hershey edged them again, 3–2, in Game 7 at the Spectrum three nights later on May 14. (Hershey went on to win their eighth Calder Cup title a few weeks later.)

===1998: Philadelphia&#x27;s first Calder Cup===

As in their inaugural season, the Phantoms again finished first overall in 1997–98 with 106 points on a record of 47–23–2–10, and again Peter White took home the Sollenberger Trophy as the league&#x27;s top scorer with another 105-point season. Sell-out crowds of 17,380 also packed the Spectrum eight times during the regular season schedule with a total season attendance of 472,392, and over 100,000 more attended the club’s home Calder Cup games during which the Phantoms played and defeated the Rochester Americans, Hershey Bears, Albany River Rats and Saint John Flames.

A crowd of 17,380 (the club&#x27;s ninth sell-out of the year) filled the Spectrum on the evening of June 10, 1998, for Game 6 of the finals that saw the Phantoms play a virtually flawless contest as they defeated the Flames 6–1 behind the stellar goaltending of Neil Little, who had allowed just 48 post-season goals on his way to a 15–5 playoff record. Winger Mike Maneluk earned the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the playoff MVP while also being the League&#x27;s leading post-season scorer with 34 points (13 goals and 21 assists). Team captain John Stevens (who had also won Calder Cups with Hershey in 1988 and Springfield in 1991, and would coach the Phantoms to another title in 2005) and his teammates paraded the Calder Cup around the same ice as the Flyers had skated their first Stanley Cup 24 years earlier.

===1999 AHL All Star game===
On January 24, 1999, the Phantoms hosted the 1999 AHL All-Star Game before a crowd of 14,120 at the then First Union (now Wells Fargo) Center. Philadelphia defenseman Serhiy Klymentiev, center Richard Park and goaltender Jean-Marc Pelletier all skated for the PlanetUSA team in that game, while centers Peter White and Jim Montgomery joined Head Coach Bill Barber and Assistant Coach Mike Stothers on the Canadian squad for which White also served as captain. Pelletier won the game’s MVP award with his outstanding period of work for PlanetUSA in their 5–4 win over Barber&#x27;s Canadian squad.

The Phantoms continued to draw fans through the turnstiles at a prodigious rate in 1998–99 as they drew a then-franchise single game attendance record of 19,532 at the First Union Center on February 28, 1999, to see the Phantoms and the Kentucky Thoroughblades skate to a 3–3 draw. With a capacity crowd of 17,380 at the Spectrum on April 11 to watch the Phantoms conclude their home schedule against the Hershey Bears, the club established an AHL-best overall single season attendance record of 480,106 for an average of 12,002 fans per game.

===Coaches===
With Head Coach Bill Barber&#x27;s promotion to the Flyers after the 1999–2000 season as an assistant (and later head) coach, Assistant Coach John Stevens—who had been forced to retire as a player the previous season because of a serious eye injury—became the second head coach of the Phantoms in June 2000. Stevens, the team&#x27;s first captain, was soon joined by two more former Flyer players, defenseman Kjell Samuelsson and winger Don Nachbaur, to complete the new staff. In November 2003, long-time NHL tough guy and former Flyer left wing Craig Berube signed with the Phantoms to finish his 18-year professional career back in Philadelphia as a player/assistant coach. At the end of that season, he retired as a player to become a full-time assistant coach for the 2004–05 campaign, replacing Nachbaur, who had since returned to the Western Hockey League (WHL) as head coach of the Tri-City Americans.

While it may have only been a coincidence, not long after signing Berube, the Phantoms and Binghamton Senators combined for 373 penalty minutes in a 5–1 Senators&#x27; win at the Spectrum on December 28, 2003, to establish new club records for most penalties in minutes (PIM), with 210, combined PIM and even an individual team mark set by Peter Vandermeer with 44 PIM. After 11 fights and 15 game misconducts, the game was called with eight seconds remaining due to a lack of enough remaining players on each team. When John Stevens was promoted to the Flyers as an assistant coach after the 2005–06 season, Berube was named the Phantoms&#x27; third head coach in June 2006. After Stevens was promoted to Flyers head coach, Berube left the Phantoms to join Stevens&#x27; staff as an assistant coach. Samuelsson, a Phantoms&#x27; assistant coach for six seasons, was named the fourth head coach in Phantoms history on October 23, 2006, and two-time Stanley Cup winner Joe Mullen, a 2000 inductee in Hockey Hall of Fame and former teammate of Samuelsson&#x27;s with the Pittsburgh Penguins, joined the club as his assistant coach. Berube returned to the Phantoms as head coach again with the 2007–08 season (and Samuelsson to associate coach) while Mullen joined former Phantoms&#x27; mentor John Stevens with the Flyers as an assistant coach for the NHL club. Berube himself joined the Flyers&#x27; coaching staff in 2008 and was replaced behind the Phantoms&#x27; bench by former Flyer winger John Paddock, a five-time Calder Cup winner as a player (two times) and coach (three times), including with the 1987–88 Hershey Bears when that team was the Flyers&#x27; AHL affiliate.

===A goalie scores – shorthanded and in OT===
The Phantoms clinched the F. G. (Teddy) Oke Trophy as the AHL&#x27;s East Division 2003–04 regular-season champion with a 0–0 tie in Bridgeport on April 10 for its fourth division title and 13th shutout of the season. (The previous franchise record for shutouts was just five.) The following night the club ended the regular season by completing its improbable 12–0 season sweep in games of the rival Hershey Bears with a bizarre 3–2 overtime victory at the Giant Center in Hershey. Goalie Antero Niittymaki was credited with the game-winner on a shorthanded, empty-net goal 2:32 into the extra session, making him the first-ever Phantom goaltender to &quot;score&quot; a goal. (Needing a win to make the playoffs, the Bears pulled their goaltender during an overtime power-play and inadvertently directed the puck in their own net. As the last Phantom to touch the puck, Niittymaki was credited with the goal.)

===2005: A second Calder Cup===

The 2004–05 season would see the now 70-year-old Calder Cup return to Philadelphia for a second time, and do so in record setting fashion. After dropping their first two games of the season on the road, the Phantoms posted a 5–3 victory over Hamilton in their home opener on October 22 which would prove to be the first win in an AHL-record 17-game win streak which they set with 3–1 victory in Hershey on November 27. On April 15, Antero Niittymaki&#x27;s 4–1 victory over Hershey also broke the team record for most wins in a season by a goaltender as he registered his 32nd win to break veteran teammate Neil Little&#x27;s mark of 31 set in both 1996–97 and 1997–98. While Niittymaki saw most of the playing time in the season, veteran Phantom netminder Neil Little was still able to make his mark as he became just the tenth goaltender in AHL history to accumulate 200 wins when he shut-out the Bridgeport Sound Tigers on March 4 as the club compiled a 16–7–1 record over the final two months of the regular season to finish just three points behind the Jason Spezza-led Binghamton Senators for second place in the division.

While the Phantoms were already a very solid contender entering the playoffs, the roster improved drastically with the addition of the Flyers&#x27; two graduating 2003 first-round draft picks, centers Jeff Carter of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)&#x27;s Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds (taken 11th overall) and Mike Richards of the OHL&#x27; Kitchener Rangers (taken 24th); each joined the Phantoms after their respective junior team were eliminated from the Memorial Cup. Carter arrived in time for the final week of the regular season schedule and went on to lead the AHL in playoff scoring with 23 points (12 goals and 11 assists) in 21 games, while Richards joined one game into the second round and went on to collect 15 points (seven goals and eight assists) in 14 games.

The Phantoms&#x27; 2005 playoff run began against the Norfolk Admirals, a team that had defeated Philadelphia in six of their ten regular-season meetings including the last game of the season played at the Spectrum on April 17. Philadelphia took the first round set in six games with a 4–2 victory at the Wachovia Center located across the parking lot from the Spectrum. (With the circus in the Spectrum for two weeks as the playoffs began and no conflicting Flyers&#x27; post-season dates at the Center because of the lockout, the AHL club would end up playing all 13 of its home Calder Cup games in the much larger NHL building.)

In the second round they met the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins who had already upset the Binghamton Senators in their first round set. After the Phantoms took the first two games at home and split games three and four in Wilkes-Barre, the series returned to the Center for one of the most memorable games in team history. Trailing 4–1 approaching the midway point of the third period of game five, the Phantoms exploded for six unanswered goals over the game&#x27;s final ten minutes en route to a 7–4 victory and a berth in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Providence Bruins whom the Phantoms dispatched as well in six games with another victory at the Center which also extended their post season home ice record to a perfect 11–0.

With the victory over Providence, the Phantoms were back to the Calder Cup Finals for the first time since 1998 and would meet the Chicago Wolves, another powerhouse team that up until that point had breezed through the playoffs including a sweep of the Manitoba Moose in the Western Conference Finals. While both teams had plenty of scoring power, it was expected to be a battle of two stellar Finnish goaltenders—the Phantoms&#x27; Niittymaki and the Wolves&#x27; Kari Lehtonen—who had both been stellar performers all season long. Even though the Phantoms had finished the regular season with 103 points on a record of 48–25–3–4, for the first time in the 2005 post-season they would have to open a series on the road, as Chicago had finished with 105 points (49–24–5–2) and had lost just seven times at home all season.

As expected, the first three games of the series were tight-checking, low-scoring contests featuring stellar goaltending at both ends of the ice. Niittymaki, however, who was just a little bit better than Lehtonen, earned a surprise 1–0 shutout victory in Game 1. He was even better in Game 2, however, holding the high-scoring Wolves to just one goal in a 2–1 double overtime victory to send the series back to Philadelphia where the next three games—if necessary—would be played and where the Phantoms were already 11–0 in the playoffs. Niittymaki again held the Wolves to just one goal as the Phantoms defeated Chicago again, 2–1, in Game 3. Through almost 11 periods of hockey over three games, Niittymaki had allowed the Wolves, who had scored 245 regular season goals, just two goals while Lehtonen and had been solved for just five by the Phantoms. The differential of three goals, however, was enough to give Philadelphia a 3–0 stranglehold on the series going into Game 4 on June 10.
An AHL playoff-record crowd of 20,103 NHL-lockout hockey starved fans filled the seats as the puck dropped that night hoping to see a Philadelphia professional hockey team win a playoff title on home ice for just the fifth time in the 78 years since the C-AHL Philadelphia Arrows first played a professional hockey game in the city in 1927. The Phantoms did not disappoint the SRO crowd as they defeated the Wolves handily, 5–2, with center Ben Stafford (who retired after the playoffs and is now a lieutenant in US Marine Corps serving in Iraq) collecting the Cup-winning goal. Rookie Jeff Carter&#x27;s 23 points (12 goals and 11 assists) earned him individual honors as the AHL&#x27;s top scorer in the playoffs, while Niittymaki won the Jack Butterfield Award as the Calder Cup MVP. After the Phantoms shook hands with the Wolves players at center ice, AHL President Dave Andrews handed the Calder Cup to team captain Boyd Kane, who skated it around the ice. Ironically, exactly seven years earlier to the day, Phantoms Head Coach John Stevens had received the same Cup from the same hands a few hundred yards away at the Spectrum as captain of the 1997–98 Phantoms. The Phantoms&#x27; victory was just the fifth time that a professional hockey title in any league had been won in a game taking place in Philadelphia since the sport was first played in the city in 1927.

===Phantoms in the NHL===
The 2004–05 Phantoms not only brought the Calder Cup back to Philadelphia for a second time, but also sent a dozen members of its championship roster on to the NHL in 2005–06. Nine players—Antero Niittymaki, Jeff Carter, Mike Richards, Patrick Sharp, Jon Sim, Joni Pitkanen, Dennis Seidenberg, Freddy Meyer and R. J. Umberger—all saw regular service with the Flyers in 2005–06, while Ben Eager, Randy Jones, Josh Gratton, Wade Skolney and Ryan Ready also were called up at least once during the season. Seidenberg, however, was later traded during the 2005–06 season to the Phoenix Coyotes.

Head Coach John Stevens later joined the Flyers as an assistant coach at the start of the 2006–07 season, eventually replacing Ken Hitchcock as head coach a month into the season.

===The final season===
 Due to the impending demolition of the Wachovia Spectrum, originally scheduled for February 4, 2009, it was announced that Comcast Spectacor reached an agreement to sell the Phantoms to the Brooks Group of Pittsburgh. The new ownership expressed an interest in eventually moving the Phantoms to Allentown, Pennsylvania, conditioned on the construction of a new multi-purpose arena there. Until a permanent new home was ready for the club, however it operated temporarily in Glens Falls, New York, the former home of the AHL&#x27;s Adirondack Red Wings. Comcast Spectacor continued to operate the team through the conclusion of the 2008–09 season.

Throughout their final season, the Phantoms wore a series of specialty jerseys in commemoration of the Spectrum and its history. These included among others a jersey designed after the jerseys worn in the 1976 NHL All-Star Game, a Broad Street Bullies jersey and a black Spectrum jersey with red, orange, green and blue stripes similar to the Spectrum logo.

On April 10, 2009, the Phantoms played their final regular season home game at the Spectrum in front of a standing room only crowd of 17,380 (the 21st sell-out in team history) and defeated the Hershey Bears, 5–2. Rob Sirianni collected the final regular season hat-trick in Spectrum history while the win also secured the Phantoms a berth in the Calder Cup playoffs. During a pre-game ceremony, one final banner was raised to the rafters of the Spectrum paying tribute to &quot;The Final Home Game&quot; and included the signature sign-off of Gene Hart, the late longtime voice of the club&#x27;s NHL parent Philadelphia Flyers: &quot;Good night and good hockey.&quot;

The Phantoms ended their 13th and final AHL regular season schedule with a 3–2 loss in Hershey the following night, setting-up a Hershey/Philadelphia matchup in the first round of the 2009 Calder Cup playoffs. The series was the fourth overall between the two Pennsylvania clubs and the first since 2000.

<doc id="607316" wikidata="Q2637658" url="?curid=607316" title="Severus ibn al-Muqaffa">
<text>Severus ibn al-Muqaffaʿ (; died 987) or Severus of El Ashmunein () was a Coptic Orthodox bishop, author and historian. Severus is sometimes confused with the Persian author Abdullah ibn al-Muqaffa&#x27; (d. 759).

He was bishop of Hermopolis Magna in Upper Egypt around the end of the tenth century. In this period, Egypt was ruled by the Isma&#x27;ili Fatimid Caliphate, which had taken Egypt from the Abbasid Caliphate in 969. Fatimid rule slowly but surely changed Coptic Christian culture, especially in the realm of language. Complaining that the Coptic Orthodox Christians of Egypt no longer knew the Coptic language, Severus composed a theological text in Arabic—the first Coptic text written in that language.

He is best known as the traditional initial author of the &quot;History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria&quot;. One of the stories in it relates how Bishop Severus was asked by the Muslim chief justice () whether a passing dog was Muslim or Christian. As it was a Friday, the Bishop said to ask the dog by offering it both meat and wine as Muslims do not drink wine and Christians do not eat meat on Fridays.

==Works==
Some of the most know works by Severus ibn al-Muqaffa are the following (for a list with 26 titles of works by the Author read Abū al-Barakāt, Catalog of Christian Literature in Arabic, which may have some different titles for the works we know presently.) :
*&quot;Lamp of the Intellect&quot; (in Arabic مصباح العقل)
*&quot;History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria&quot; (in Arabic تاريخ بطاركة كنيسة الإسكندرية القبطية). This is a compilation begun by Severus Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ and based on earlier biographical sources. It was continued by others including Michael, bishop of Tinnis (11th century, writing in Coptic, covering 880 to 1046), ibn Mufarrij, deacon of Alexandria., and Pope Mark III of Alexandria (for 1131 to 1167).
*&quot;Affliction&#x27;s physic and the cure of sorrow&quot; (In Arabic طبّ الغمّ وشفاء الحزن)
*&quot;Book of The Precious Pearl&quot;, 15 Chapters. A book rich with Biblical and Patristic citations (especially citing the Greek Fathers of The Church, Athanasius, Cyril of Alexandria, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Thaumaturgus, Epiphanius of Salamis, Chrysostom, Severus of Antioch and Dioscorus of Alexandria). The book has 1161 Biblical citations and at least 191 Patristic citations.
(Full title in Arabic: كتاب الدر الثمين في إيضاح الاعتقاد في الدين بما نطقت به أفواه النبيين والرسل الأطهار المؤيدين والأباء المعلمين والبطاركة المغبوطين علي تجسد رب المجد وصعوده وإرساله الباراقليط).
* The Refutation Of Eutychius, of four parts and also known as The Book On The Councils (Arabic: كتاب المجامع). The book was written mainly to defend the position of the Jacobites who rejected the Council of Chalcedon against what has been brought up by the Melchite Patriarch Eutychius, or Sa&#x27;id ibn Bitriq, in his book known as the Annals Of Eutychius.
* The Arrangement of the Priesthood, i.e. Information on Ranks in the Church, (Arabic: ترتيب الكهنوت).
*The Book of Brief Explanation on the Faith, (Arabic: البيان المختصر في الإيمان).
*The Explanation, (Arabic: كتاب الإيضاح , Kitāb al-īḍāḥ), 12 Chapters. The book is sometimes confused with the previously-mentioned book of The Precious Pearl.
* Stringing together of Jewel and Pearls, in answer to the doctrine of fate and divine decree (Arabic: نظم الجواهر والدرر ضد القائلين بالقضاء والقدر), Mistakenly-attributed to George Elmacin (ابن المكين).

<text>Sharman Nancy Stone (née Bawden; born 23 April 1951) is a former Australian politician who represented Murray in the Australian House of Representatives between March 1996 and July 2016 as a member of the Liberal Party. She subsequently served as the Australian Ambassador for Women and Girls from when Natasha Stott Despoja stepped down from the role in late 2016 until 2020.

==Background==
Stone was born in Pyramid Hill, Victoria, the daughter of Harvey Bawden and Nancy Chalmers. She graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor of Arts (Hons), from La Trobe University with a Master of Arts, from Hawthorn College of Advanced Education with a Graduate Diploma of Education, and was awarded a PhD by Monash
. She was Manager of International Development at the University of Melbourne, Director of Communications at the Victorian Farmers Federation, and a farmer before entering politics.

==Political career==
Elected to federal parliament at the 1996 federal election, Stone was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in October 1998. Following the re-election of the Howard government in October 2004, she became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. On 27 January 2006 she was appointed Minister for Workforce Participation, succeeding Peter Dutton.

After the defeat of the Howard government in November 2007, Stone took up the role of Shadow Minister for Environment, Heritage, the Arts and Indigenous Affairs. Following Malcolm Turnbull&#x27;s defeat of Brendan Nelson for the leadership of the Liberal Party, and the retirement of Senator Chris Ellison, Stone became Shadow Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in the subsequent reshuffle. Stone announced her retirement from politics on 26 March 2016, which took effect from the double dissolution of the Australian Parliament on 9 May, in advance of the 2016 federal election on 2 July.

==Author==
Stone is an author of numerous publications on race relations, environment and geology (with Doug Stone) among others, including &quot;Aborigines in White Australia&quot; (London and Melbourne, 1974).

Stone was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2024 Australia Day Honours for &quot;significant service to the people and Parliament of Australia, and to the community through executive positions&quot;.

<text>Robert J. Sternberg (born December 8, 1949) is an American psychologist and psychometrician. He is a Professor of Human Development at Cornell University.

Sternberg has a BA from Yale University and a PhD from Stanford University, under advisor Gordon Bower. He holds thirteen honorary doctorates from two North American, one South American, one Asian, and nine European universities, and additionally holds an honorary professorship at the University of Heidelberg, in Germany. He is a Distinguished Associate of the Psychometrics Centre at the University of Cambridge.

Among his major contributions to psychology, the most notable are the triarchic theory of intelligence and several influential theories related to creativity, wisdom, thinking styles, love, hate, and leadership. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Sternberg as the 60th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Early life ==
Sternberg was born on December 8, 1949, to a Jewish family, in New Jersey. Sternberg suffered from test anxiety as a child. As a result, he became an inadequate test taker. This upset him and he reasoned that a test was not an adequate measurement of his true knowledge and academic abilities. When he later retook a test in a room that consisted of younger students, he felt more comfortable and his scores increased dramatically. Sternberg later constructed the Test of Mental Ability (STOMA), his first intelligence test. This problem of test-taking is what sparked Sternberg&#x27;s interest in psychology.

== Career ==

Sternberg was an undergraduate student at Yale University. Neither of Sternberg&#x27;s parents finished high school, and he attended Yale only by achieving a National Merit Scholarship and receiving financial aid. He did so poorly in his introductory psychology class that his professor insisted that he pursue another major. Determined to succeed, Sternberg earned a BA summa cum laude, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, gaining honors and exceptional distinction in psychology. Sternberg continued his academic career at Stanford University, where he earned his PhD, in 1975.

Sternberg returned to Yale as an assistant professor of Psychology in 1975, and would work at Yale for three decades, eventually becoming the IBM Professor of Psychology and Education, as well as the founder and director of the Center for the Psychology of Abilities, Competencies and Expertise.

He left Yale in 2005 to assume the position of Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Tufts University, where he quickly began his job search for a promotion to a Provost position. After multiple unsuccessful high-profile attempts to gain other academic leadership positions within a few years of arriving at Tufts, including at the University of Colorado and the University of Iowa, Sternberg was offered a position at Oklahoma State University in 2010, where he remained as provost for three years. In early 2013, Sternberg was named the new president of the University of Wyoming. After resigning from the University of Wyoming in late 2013, Sternberg joined the Human Development faculty of Cornell University.

=== University of Wyoming presidency ===
Sternberg took office in July 2013 as the University of Wyoming&#x27;s 24th president. His major aim was to push the &quot;development of ethical leadership in students, faculty and staff&quot;. Therefore, Sternberg wanted to change the University of Wyoming&#x27;s test-based selection process of applicants towards an ethics-based admission process: &quot;The set of analytical skills evaluated in the ACT [American College Testing] is only a small sliver of what you need to be an ethical leader.&quot;

After arriving at the University of Wyoming, Sternberg&#x27;s term was marked by tumult in the faculty. Three weeks after taking in office as Wyoming&#x27;s new president, the provost and vice president for academic affairs was asked to resign and stepped down. In the next four months, three associate provosts and four deans were asked to resign or resigned voluntarily—many explicitly citing disagreements with President Sternberg&#x27;s approach. In the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, November 15, 2013 (&quot;President of U of Wyoming Abruptly Resigns&quot; by Lindsay Ellis), Sternberg&#x27;s tenure was described as &quot;a period that saw rapid turnover among senior administrators and unsettled the campus.&quot;

The last dean who stepped down, the Dean of the College of Law, Stephen Easton, accused Sternberg at a university meeting of unethical treatment of staff, professors, and schools. &quot;You have not treated this law school ethically.&quot; Sternberg refused to discuss the case at the meeting. The &quot;Casper Star Tribune&quot; portrayed the situation at the university as &quot;chaos in the college&quot;. Additionally, other provosts blamed a lack of respect for and interest in human capital. According to Peter Shive, a professor emeritus, Sternberg asked everyone to wear the school colors, brown and gold, on Fridays. Shive said the farther away from the administrative building he went, the fewer people were wearing brown and gold.

Ray Hunkins, a UW Law College graduate, former counsel to the UW trustees, a member of the board of directors of the UW Foundation, and the Republican nominee for governor of Wyoming in 2006, questioned Sternberg&#x27;s policies that had led to the dismissal or resignation of the administrators. &quot;I think there&#x27;s chaos in the university,&quot; Hunkins said.

On November 14, 2013, only 137 days after Sternberg had taken the helm of UW, it was announced at a press conference following a trustees meeting in William Robertson Coe Library that Sternberg had tendered his resignation to the board. In a public statement read by the trustee president, David Bostrom, Sternberg said that despite his care for the university, &quot;It may not be the best fit for me as president.&quot; Laughter arose immediately upon the reading of Sternberg&#x27;s statement. In accordance to university regulations, vice president for academic affairs Dr. Dick McGinity took the office as interim president. His resignation was neither asked for, nor forced by the Board of Trustees.

According to the &quot;Wyoming News&quot;, Sternberg&#x27;s four-month presidency produced more than $1.25 million in administration-related costs equivalent to the costs of 31 faculty staff positions for one year. That includes $377,000 for Sternberg&#x27;s severance pay, including $325,000 that he will be paid 2014; $37,500 in deferred compensation Sternberg is due by December 31; about $89,000 for the next presidential search; $330,000 for search firms to find replacements for administrators and deans who resigned; $265,000 for renovations to the house and garage that Sternberg was allowed to continue to rent at a price of $1,100 a month until May 31.

== Honorary degrees ==

Sternberg holds thirteen honorary doctorates, including some from universities outside the United States. The list of foreign universities that awarded the degrees includes Complutense University of Madrid (Spain), University of Durham (UK), University of Leuven (Belgium), Tilburg University (the Netherlands), University of Cyprus, University of Paris V (France), and St. Petersburg State University (Russia).

== Publication ethics ==
Sternberg began serving as editor of the journal &quot;Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot; in 2015. As editor he published eight commentaries in his own journal between 2016 and 2018 without peer review. In response to one of these pieces, a letter of concern was drafted, which over 100 psychologists endorsed. In addition to the concerns about the lack of peer review, the letter of concern also mentioned that these articles feature extreme levels of self-citation, ranging from 42% to 65%. In response to the letter and from pressure on social media, Sternberg resigned in late April 2018 from his position of editor of &quot;Perspectives on Psychological Science&quot;, over a year and a half before his term was scheduled to end.

== Awards and recognition ==

Sternberg&#x27;s awards include the Cattell Award from the Association for Psychological Science (APS), Sir Francis Galton Award from the International Association of Empirical Aesthetics, the Arthur W. Staats Award from the American Psychological Foundation and the Society for General Psychology, the E. L. Thorndike Award for Career Achievement in Educational Psychology Award from the Society for Educational Psychology of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the Grawemeyer Award for Psychology in 2018. In the APA Monitor on Psychology, Sternberg has been rated as one of the top 100 psychologists of the twentieth century. The ISI has rated Sternberg as one of the most highly cited authors in psychology and psychiatry (top .5 percent). Sternberg is a fellow of the National Academy of Education, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and other organizations. He is past-president of the American Psychological Association and the Eastern Psychological Association, and currently is President of the Federation of Associations in the Behavioral and Brain Sciences.

== Research interests ==
Sternberg&#x27;s main research include the following interests:
*Higher mental functions, including intelligence and creativity and wisdom
*Styles of thinking
*Cognitive modifiability
*Leadership
*Love and hate

Sternberg has proposed a triarchic theory of intelligence and a triangular theory of love. He is the creator (with Todd Lubart) of the investment theory of creativity, which states that creative people buy low and sell high in the world of ideas, and a propulsion theory of creative contributions, which states that creativity is a form of leadership.

He spearheaded an experimental admissions process at Tufts to quantify and test the creativity, practical skills, and wisdom-based skills of an applicant. He used similar techniques when he was provost at Oklahoma State.

Sternberg has criticized IQ tests, saying they are &quot;convenient partial operationalizations of the construct of intelligence, and nothing more. They do not provide the kind of measurement of intelligence that tape measures provide of height.&quot;

In 1995, he was on an American Psychological Association task force writing a consensus statement on the state of intelligence research in response to the claims being advanced amid the &quot;Bell Curve&quot; controversy, titled &quot;.&quot;

== Triarchic theory of intelligence ==

Many descriptions of intelligence focus on mental abilities such as vocabulary, comprehension, memory and problem-solving that can be measured through intelligence tests. This reflects the tendency of psychologists to develop their understanding of intelligence by observing behavior believed to be associated with intelligence.

Sternberg believes that this focus on specific types of measurable mental abilities is too narrow. He believes that studying intelligence in this way leads to an understanding of only one part of intelligence and that this part is only seen in people who are &quot;school smart&quot; or &quot;book smart&quot;.

There are, for example, many individuals who score poorly on intelligence tests, but are creative or are &quot;street smart&quot; and therefore have a very good ability to adapt and shape their environment. According to Sternberg (2003), giftedness should be examined in a broader way incorporating other parts of intelligence.

=== The triarchic model ===

Sternberg (2003) categorizes intelligence into three parts, which are central in his theory:

*Analytical intelligence, the ability to complete academic, problem-solving tasks, such as those used in traditional intelligence tests. These types of tasks usually present well-defined problems that have only a single correct answer.
*Creative or synthetic intelligence, the ability to successfully deal with new and unusual situations by drawing on existing knowledge and skills. Individuals high in creative intelligence may give &#x27;wrong&#x27; answers because they see things from a different perspective.
*Practical intelligence, the ability to adapt to everyday life by drawing on existing knowledge and skills. Practical intelligence enables an individual to understand what needs to be done in a specific setting and then do it.

Sternberg (2003) discusses experience and its role in intelligence. Creative or synthetic intelligence helps individuals to transfer information from one problem to another. Sternberg calls the application of ideas from one problem to a new type of problem &quot;relative novelty&quot;. In contrast to the skills of relative novelty there is &quot;relative familiarity&quot; which enables an individual to become so familiar with a process that it becomes automatized. This can free up brain resources for coping with new ideas.

Context, or how one adapts, selects and shapes their environment is another area that is not represented by traditional measures of giftedness. Practically intelligent people are good at picking up tacit information and utilizing that information. They tend to shape their environment around them. (Sternberg, 2003)

Sternberg (2003) developed a testing instrument to identify people who are gifted in ways that other tests don&#x27;t identify. The Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test measures not only traditional intelligence abilities but analytic, synthetic, automatization and practical abilities as well. There are four ways in which this test is different from conventional intelligence tests.
*This test is broader, measuring synthetic and practical skills in addition to analytic skills. The test provides scores on analytic, synthetic, automatization, and practical abilities, as well as verbal, quantitative, and figural processing abilities.
*The test measures the ability to understand unknown words in context rather than vocabulary skills which are dependent on an individual&#x27;s background.
*The automatization subtest is the only part of the test that measures mental speed.
*The test is based on a theory of intelligence.

=== Practical application ===

Sternberg added experimental criteria to the application process for undergraduates to Tufts University, where he was Dean of Arts and Sciences, to test &quot;creativity and other non-academic factors.&quot; Calling it the &quot;first major university to try such a departure from the norm,&quot; &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot; noted that Tufts continues to consider the SAT and other traditional criteria.

== Theory in cognitive styles ==
Sternberg proposed a theory of cognitive styles in 1988.

Sternberg&#x27;s basic idea is that the forms of government we have in the world are external reflections of the way different people view and act in the world, that is, different ways of organizing and thinking. Cognitive styles should not be confused with abilities, they are the way we prefer to use these abilities. Indeed, a good fit between a person&#x27;s preferred cognitive profile and his abilities can create a powerful synergy that outweighs the sum of its parts.

The main three branches of government are the executive branch, legislative branch and judicial branch. People also need to perform these functions in their own thinking and working. Legislative people like to build new structures, creating their own rules along the way. Executive people are rule followers, they like to be given a predetermined structure in which to work. Judicial people like to evaluate rules and procedures, to analyze a given structure.

The four forms of mental self-government are hierarchical, monarchic, oligarchic, and anarchic. The hierarchic style holds multiple goals simultaneously and prioritizes them. The oligarchic style is similar but differs in involving difficulty prioritizing. The monarchic style, in comparison, focuses on a single activity until completion. The anarchic style resists conformity to &quot;systems, rules, or particular approaches to problems.&quot;

The two levels of mental self-government are local and global. The local style focuses on more specific and concrete problems, in extreme case they &quot;can&#x27;t see the forest for the trees&quot;. The global style, in comparison, focuses on more abstract and global problems, in extreme cases they &quot;can&#x27;t see the trees for the forest&quot;.

The two scopes of mental self-government are internal and external. The internal style focuses inwards and prefers to work independently. The external style focuses outwards and prefers to work in collaboration.

The two leanings of mental self-government are the liberal and conservative. These styles have nothing to do with politics. The liberal individual likes change, to go beyond existing rules and procedures. The conservative individual dislikes change and ambiguity, he will be happiest in a familiar and predictable environment.

All people have different profiles of thinking styles which can change over situations and time of life. Moreover, a person can, and often does, have a secondary preferred thinking style.

<text>Dokos () is a small Greek island of the Argo-Saronic Gulf, adjacent to Hydra, and separated from the Peloponnese by a narrow strait called, on some maps, &quot;the Hydra Gulf.&quot; It is part of the municipality of Ýdra (Hydra) in Islands regional unit and reported a population of 18 persons at the 2011 census. The island is populated only by some Orthodox monks and perennial sheep herders. The island is rocky, reaching a height of .
During ancient times it was called Aperopia (Ἀπεροπία).

==Archaeology==
It has, since the ancient years, considered to be a strategic location. On the east side lie the ruins of a great Byzantine - Venetian Castle. During the Middle Ages, the island served as a refuge for Albanian settlers&#x27; animals.

Dokos, according to archaeological studies, has been inhabited since the early Bronze Age. In 1975, Peter Throckmorton discovered a wreck near Dokos that has been dated to about 2150 BC, and may be the oldest shipwreck known.

<doc id="607337" wikidata="Q2314865" url="?curid=607337" title="Mitch Hedberg">
<text>Mitchell Lee Hedberg (February 24, 1968 – March 30, 2005) was an American stand-up comedian known for his surreal humor and deadpan delivery. His comedy typically featured short, sometimes one-line jokes mixed with absurd elements and non sequiturs.

Hedberg&#x27;s comedy and onstage persona gained him a cult following, with audience members sometimes shouting out the punchlines to his jokes before he could finish them.

== Early life ==
Hedberg was born on February 24, 1968, in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the son of Arne and Mary (née Schimscha, 1943–2012) Hedberg. He was of Finnish-Swedish (from his paternal grandparents), Czech, and German descent. Hedberg attended Harding High School in Saint Paul. Hedberg said he was a good student, and often ahead of the rest of the class, but got bored and lost interest around 10th grade, when he started cutting classes. He struggled to graduate from high school, and did not attend college.

== Career ==
Hedberg began his stand-up career in Florida, and after a period of honing his skills, he moved to Seattle and began to tour. He soon appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Comikaze&quot;, followed by a 1996 appearance on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; that brought him his big break. He won the 1997 grand prize at the Seattle Comedy Competition. The next year he appeared in an episode of Fox&#x27;s series &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;.

In 1999, he completed his own independent feature film, &quot;Los Enchiladas!&quot;, which he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in. He recorded three comedy albums: &quot;Strategic Grill Locations&quot;, &quot;Mitch All Together&quot;, and &quot;Do You Believe in Gosh?&quot;, the last released posthumously. He performed at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal three times: in 1998, 2001, and 2004.

Concurrent with his rising fame in the entertainment industry, Hedberg appeared on &quot;Letterman&quot; nine more times, signed a half-million-dollar deal with Fox for a television sitcom, and was dubbed &quot;the next Seinfeld&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, Mike Birbiglia, Norm MacDonald and Lewis Black were among his comedian fans. Comedians Anthony Jeselnik, Bo Burnham and Ron Funches have listed Hedberg as an influence.

== Style ==
Hedberg&#x27;s stand-up comedy was distinguished by the unique manner of speech he adopted later in his career, his abrupt delivery, and his unusual stage presence. His act usually consisted of compact one- or two-liners and longer routines, often with each line as a punchline.

Hedberg occasionally added disclaimers to the end of a joke if it was not sufficiently well received, frequently variations on &quot;that joke&#x27;s dumb, I&#x27;m aware of that.&quot; During recordings for CDs, he would often say that he would find a way to edit a failed gag to make it seem well-received, for example by &quot;adding laughter&quot; to a failed joke containing arithmetic. Following such a failure on &quot;Strategic Grill Locations&quot;, Hedberg suggested, &quot;All right... that joke is going to be good because I&#x27;m going to take all the words out and add new words. That joke will be fixed.&quot;

Comedy Central Records released an album, &quot;Do You Believe in Gosh?&quot; on September 9, 2008, that contained material Hedberg recorded at The Improv in Ontario, California, in January 2005. His wife, Lynn, wrote in the introduction that the performance had been in preparation for a year-end CD recording.

== Personal life ==
Hedberg was married to Canadian comedian Lynn Shawcroft from 1999 until his death in 2005.

Hedberg was a frequent recreational drug user, mentioning it in some of his jokes (e.g., &quot;I used to do drugs. I still do, but I used to, too&quot;). He was interviewed by Jonathan Davis in the December 2001 issue of &quot;Penthouse&quot;. In the interview, published three years before his death, he was asked, &quot;If you could choose, how would you end your life?&quot; He replied, &quot;First, I&#x27;d want to get famous, and then I&#x27;d overdose. If I overdosed at this stage in my career, I would be lucky if it made the back pages.&quot; On June 23, 2003, he was arrested in Austin, Texas, for heroin possession. On October 12, 2004, Hedberg sat in on the news with Robin Quivers on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. He appeared on the show again on March 17, 2005, two weeks before his death, this time with Quivers and Artie Lange present, and briefly discussed his drug use, saying: &quot;Well, you know, I got the drugs under control now.&quot; Stern asked, &quot;Do you? You know how to take them responsibly?&quot; Hedberg replied, &quot;Yeah, you know, just for the creative side of it.&quot;

== Death ==
On March 30, 2005, Hedberg was found dead in his room at The Westminster Hotel in Livingston, New Jersey. His death was announced by Howard Stern on March 31, but was largely overlooked. As a result, some people thought it was announced on April 1, and fans believed it was an April Fools&#x27; Day joke.

His death was initially believed to be the result of a congenital heart defect, but in December 2005, the New Jersey Medical Examiner&#x27;s office reported that he died accidentally as the result of &quot;multiple drug toxicity&quot;, including cocaine and heroin.

Hedberg&#x27;s funeral was held at St. Ambrose Catholic Church in Woodbury, Minnesota. His grave is in Roselawn Cemetery, Roseville, Minnesota.

<doc id="607345" wikidata="Q1127583" url="?curid=607345" title="Crown of thorns">
<text>According to the New Testament, a woven crown of thorns ( or ) was placed on the head of Jesus during the events leading up to his crucifixion. It was one of the instruments of the Passion, employed by Jesus&#x27; captors both to cause him pain and to mock his claim of authority. It is mentioned in the gospels of Matthew (Matthew 27:29), Mark (Mark 15:17) and John (John 19:2, 19:5), and is often alluded to by the early Church Fathers, such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen and others, along with being referenced in the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.

Since around 400 AD, a relic has been venerated as the crown of thorns. In 1238, the Latin Emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople yielded the relic to French King Louis IX. It was kept in the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris until 15 April 2019, when it was rescued from a fire and moved to the Louvre Museum. On 12 December 2024 a ceremony marking its return to Notre Dame Cathedral was led by a procession attended by members of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre.

Reproductions of the crown are available to tourists from shops in Jerusalem.

==As a relic==

===Jerusalem===
The three Biblical gospels that mention the crown of thorns do not say what happened to it after the crucifixion. The oldest known mention of the crown already being venerated as a relic was made by Paulinus of Nola, writing after 409, who refers to the crown as a relic that was adored by the faithful (&quot;Epistle Macarius&quot; in Migne, , LXI, 407). Cassiodorus () speaks of the crown of thorns among other relics which were &quot;the glory&quot; of the city of Jerusalem. &quot;There&quot;, he says, &quot;we may behold the thorny crown, which was only set upon the head of Our Redeemer in order that all the thorns of the world might be gathered together and broken&quot; (Migne, LXX, 621). When Gregory of Tours in avers that the thorns in the crown still looked green, a freshness which was miraculously renewed each day, he does not much strengthen the historical authenticity of a relic he had not seen, but the &quot;Breviary of Jerusalem&quot; (a short text dated to about 530 AD), and the &quot;itinerary&quot; of Antoninus of Piacenza (6th century) clearly state that the crown of thorns was then shown in the &quot;Basilica of Mount Zion,&quot; although there is uncertainty about the actual site to which the authors refer. From these fragments of evidence and others of later date (the &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; of the monk Bernard shows that the relic was still at Mount Zion in 870), it is shown that a purported crown of thorns was venerated at Jerusalem in the early centuries of the common era.

===Constantinople===
Some time afterwards, the crown was purportedly moved to Constantinople, the then capital of the Roman Empire. Historian François de Mély supposed that the whole crown was transferred from Jerusalem to Constantinople not much earlier than 1063. In any case, Emperor Justinian is stated to have given a thorn to Germain, Bishop of Paris, which was long preserved at Saint-Germain-des-Prés, while the Empress Irene, in 798 or 802, sent Charlemagne several thorns which were deposited by him at Aachen. Eight of these are said to have been there at the consecration of the basilica of Aachen; the subsequent history of several of them can be traced without difficulty: four were given to Saint-Corneille of Compiègne in 877 by Charles the Bald; Hugh the Great, Duke of the Franks, sent one to the Anglo-Saxon King Athelstan in 927, on the occasion of certain marriage negotiations, and it eventually found its way to Malmesbury Abbey; another was presented to a Spanish princess about 1160; and again another was taken to Andechs Abbey in Germany in the year 1200.

===France===
In 1238, Baldwin II, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople, anxious to obtain support for his tottering empire, offered the crown of thorns to Louis IX of France. It was then in the hands of the Venetians as security for a great loan of 13,134 gold pieces, yet it was redeemed and conveyed to Paris where Louis IX built the Sainte-Chapelle, completed in 1248, to receive it. The relic stayed there until the French Revolution, when, after finding a home for a while in the Bibliothèque Nationale, the Concordat of 1801 restored it to the Catholic Church, and it was deposited in the Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris.

The exact plant species used to make the crown is not confirmed. The relic that the church received was examined in the nineteenth century, and it appeared to be a twisted circlet of rushes of &quot;Juncus balticus&quot;, a plant native to maritime areas of northern Britain, the Baltic region, and Scandinavia. The thorns preserved in various other reliquaries appeared to be &quot;Ziziphus spina-christi&quot;, a plant native to Africa and Southern and Western Asia, and had allegedly been removed from the crown and kept in separate reliquaries since soon after they arrived in France. New reliquaries were provided for the relic, one commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte, another, in jeweled rock crystal and more suitably Gothic, was made to the designs of Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In 2001, when the surviving treasures from the Sainte-Chapelle were exhibited at the Louvre, the chaplet was solemnly presented every Friday at Notre-Dame. Pope John Paul II translated it personally to Sainte-Chapelle during World Youth Day. The relic can be seen only on the first Friday of every month, when it is exhibited for a special veneration Mass, as well as each Friday of Lent (see also Feast of the Crown of Thorns).

Members of the Paris Fire Brigade saved the relic during the Notre-Dame de Paris fire of April 15, 2019.

The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states:

==Third-class relics==
Not all of the reputed holy thorns are considered to be &quot;first-class&quot; relics (relics held to be of the original crown). In Roman Catholic tradition, a relic of the first class is a part of the body of a saint or, in this case, any of the objects used in the Crucifixion that carried the blood of Christ; a relic of the second class is anything known to have been touched or used by a saint; a relic of the third class is a devotional object touched to a first-class relic and, usually, formally blessed as a sacramental.

M. de Mély was able to enumerate more than 700 holy thorns relics. The statement in one medieval obituary that Peter de Aveiro gave to the cathedral of Angers, (&quot;one of the spines which were attached to the thorny crown of our Redeemer&quot;) indicates that many of the thorns were relics of the third class—objects touched to a relic of the first class, in this case some part of the crown itself. Again, even in comparatively modern times, it is not always easy to trace the history of these objects of devotion, as first-class relics were often divided and any number of authentic third-class relics may exist.

==Purported remnants==

Prior to the Seventh Crusade, Louis IX of France bought from Baldwin II of Constantinople what was venerated as Jesus&#x27; Crown of Thorns. It is kept in Paris to this day, in the Louvre Museum. Individual thorns were given by the French monarch to other European royals: the Holy Thorn Reliquary in the British Museum, for example, containing a single thorn, was made in the 1390s for the French prince Jean, duc de Berry, who is documented as receiving more than one thorn from Charles V and VI, his brother and nephew.

Two &quot;holy thorns&quot; were venerated, one at St. Michael&#x27;s church in Ghent, the other at Stonyhurst College, both professing to be thorns given by Mary, Queen of Scots to Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland.

The &quot;Gazetteer of Relics and Miraculous Images&quot; lists the following, following Cruz 1984:

==Iconography==
The appearance of the crown of thorns in art, notably upon the head of Christ in representations of the Crucifixion or the subject &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;, arises after the time of St. Louis and the building of the Sainte-Chapelle. The &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; reported that some archaeologists had professed to discover a figure of the crown of thorns in the circle which sometimes surrounds the chi-rho emblem on early Christian sarcophagi, but the compilers considered that it seemed to be quite as probable that this was only meant for a laurel wreath.

The image of the crown of thorns is often used symbolically to contrast with earthly monarchical crowns. In the symbolism of King Charles the Martyr, the executed English King Charles I is depicted putting aside his earthly crown to take up the crown of thorns, as in William Marshall&#x27;s print Eikon Basilike. This contrast appears elsewhere in art, for example in Frank Dicksee&#x27;s painting &quot;The Two Crowns&quot;.

Catholic missionaries likened several parts of the &quot;Passiflora&quot; plant to elements of the Passion: the flower&#x27;s radial filaments, which can number more than a hundred and vary from flower to flower, represent the crown of thorns.
Carnations symbolize the passion as they represent the crown of thorns.

==Photo gallery==
==Criticism of the veneration of the crown of thorns==
A critique of the adoration of the crown of thorns was set forth in 1543 by John Calvin in the work &quot;Treatise on Relics&quot;. He described numerous parts of the crown of thorns known to him, located in different cities. Based on a large number of parts of the crown of thorns, Calvin wrote:

In regard to the Crown of thorns, it would seem that its twigs had been planted that they might grow again. Otherwise I know not how it could have attained to such a size. First, a third part of it is at Paris, in the Holy Chapel, and then at Rome there are three thorns in Santa Croce, and some portion also in St. Eustathius. At Sienna, I know not how many thorns, at Vincennes one, at Bourges five, at Besançon, in the church of St. John, three, and as many at Koenigsberg. At the church of St. Salvator, in Spain, are several, but how many I know not; at Compostella, in the church of St. Jago, two; in Vivarais, three; also at Toulouse, Mascon, Charrox in Poictou, St. Clair, Sanflor, San Maximin in Provence, in the monastery of Selles, and also in the church of St. Martin at Noyon, each place having a single thorn. But if diligent search were made, the number might be increased fourfold. It is most evident that there must here be falsehood and imposition. How will the truth be ascertained? It ought, moreover, to be observed, that in the ancient Church it was never known what had become of that crown. Hence it is easy to conclude, that the first twig of that now shown grew many years after our Saviour&#x27;s death.

<text>The Municipality of Strathfield is a local government area in the inner west of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

The municipality was incorporated on 2 June 1885. The council area was made up of parts of three existing localities: Redmire (in the northeast), Homebush (in the northwest) and Druitt Town (in the south). The name &quot;Strathfield&quot; was adopted as the name of the new council upon incorporation. In 1886, the suburb of Redmire was renamed Strathfield, as was the railway station. 

The municipality today comprises an area of and as at the had an estimated residents. The council area is made up of residential neighbourhoods and town centres, with significant local heritage, open space, lifestyle amenities, public and private schools and access to tertiary institutions such as a campus of Australian Catholic University and the University of Sydney and TAFE Sydney Institute.

The Mayor of Strathfield Municipal Council is John-Paul Baladi, a member of the Liberal Party of Australia. The deputy mayor is Benjamin Cai an Independent member.

==History==

The Municipality of Strathfield was proclaimed on 2 June 1885 by the NSW Governor, Sir Augustus Loftus. The initial boundaries included Redmire (later renamed Strathfield), the village of Homebush (the southern part of the present suburb of Homebush and the north-western part of the present-day suburb of Strathfield) and the northern part of Druitt Town (the southern part of today&#x27;s suburb of Strathfield). The council was incorporated following petitions by residents of the Redmire area to form local government. This move was opposed by residents of Homebush and Druitt Town, possibly fearing the dominance of the more affluent and politically connected residents of Redmire. Despite counter petitions, the Municipality was incorporated in 1885. 

Strathfield Council built the current Council Chambers in 1887. Between 1885 and 1887 the council operated from various private homes in Strathfield, pending the building of a permanent Council Chambers. 

The Strathfield Council area has expanded in geography and population over time. In 1892, an area in the west of the present-day municipality was added, being the suburb of Flemington, including Flemington village in the north. As well, the part of the present-day municipality that lies south of Cook&#x27;s River and north of Liverpool Road, in the south, which are now the southwestern part of the suburb of Strathfield and the northeastern part of the Greenacre. The entire Council area came to be referred to as &quot;Strathfield&quot; after this expansion, and the southern and western boundaries of the present-day suburb of Strathfield largely reflects the council boundaries in 1892. With the 1892 addition, Strathfield Municipality was divided into three wards: Flemington Ward in the west (covering the area incorporated in 1892, from Flemington station in the north to Liverpool Road in the south), Homebush Ward in the centre (covering the original council area west of Homebush Road, from Homebush station in the north to Liverpool Road in the south), and Strathfield Ward in the east (covering the remainder of the original council area, east of Homebush Road). The wards were abolished on 30 August 1916.

In 1947, the Municipality of Homebush was amalgamated with Strathfield. This local government area covered the part of present-day Flemington (including Flemington markets) and Homebush that lies north of the railway. The former village centres of Flemington and Homebush south of the railway were carved out of the then-suburb of Strathfield and combined with the newly incorporated area to create the present-day suburbs of Flemington, Homebush West and Homebush. In 1949, the west ward of the Municipality of Enfield was added to Strathfield, with the eastern part going to the Municipality of Burwood. This added the present-day suburbs of Strathfield South, eastern part of Greenacre, and northern part of Belfield. At the time of this expansion, the council was divided into two wards: first ward (Strathfield and Homebush) and second ward (Enfield). These wards were abolished in 1953.

In 1992, a section of the northern part of the Municipality, between the A3 road and Boundary Creek, was transferred to the then Auburn Council to become part of the site of Sydney Olympic Park. In return, the area of and between Boundary Creek and the railway line, occupied by the former Ford factory building, was transferred from Auburn to Strathfield Council.

In 2021, a proposal was submitted to the Geographical Names Board, to separate the northern part of Belfield which was within the Municipality of Strathfield (north of Punchbowl Road) from the southern part within the City of Canterbury-Bankstown. Under this proposal, northern Belfield would form part of Strathfield South, from which it was separated by the Cooks River. This was approved in 2023.

The municipality now includes the suburbs of Strathfield, Flemington, Homebush, Homebush West, Strathfield South, and a minor part of Greenacre.

===Recent council amalgamation proposals===

Throughout its history, there have been movements to amalgamate local councils in the Sydney area: the first major &#x27;threat&#x27; was with the &#x27;royal commission for a greater Sydney (1913)&#x27;, known as &#x27;The Greater Sydney Movement&#x27;. The Royal Commission brought together Sidney Webb, a British politician and John Fitzgerald, an Australian politician, who, amongst others, believed that Sydney should be merged into a single local government area. In 1947 Homebush and Strathfield councils merged and part of Enfield was added in 1949.

A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the Strathfield Municipal Council merge with adjoining councils. The government proposed a merger of the Burwood, Canada Bay, and Strathfield Councils to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 163,000. On 6 May Strathfield Council commenced legal action in the NSW Land and Environment Court against the proposed amalgamation. After the Court heard that there were legal flaws in the report from the NSW Government appointed delegate who examined the proposal for merging the councils, the NSW Government withdrew from the case and the merger proposal stalled. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Strathfield, Burwood and Canada Bay local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers.

==Geography==

The Strathfield Council area is located at 33°52&#x27;10&quot; North, 151°5&#x27;59&quot; West (33.8717, 151.0899). It covers a total area of approximately and includes the suburbs of Strathfield, Strathfield South, Homebush, Homebush West, Flemington and parts of Greenacre. Homebush Bay Drive bounds Strathfield Council to the north, Powells Creek, The Boulevarde and Coronation Parade bounds it to the east, Punchbowl Road and Juno Parade form the southern border and Roberts Road, Chullora rail yards, Rookwood Cemetery and the Sydney Olympic Park Rail line bound the Municipality to the west.

Similarly to other parts of the Inner West, the geography of the Municipality of Strathfield is characterised by the catchments of the Parramatta River to the north, and the Cooks River to the south. Smaller creeks flow towards these two rivers through the municipality, although most of them are now canalised. The two largest are Powells Creek and Saleyards Creek, which join and eventually flow to the Parramatta River. The Cooks River itself is a minor waterway as it flows through the municipality, and is canalised in the eastern part of the municipality. In this area, the Hume Highway, which runs through the south of the municipality, approximates the ridgeline between the two catchments.

==Council==
===Current composition and election method===

Strathfield Municipal Council is composed of seven councillors elected proportionally as one entire ward. All councillors are elected for a fixed four-year term of office. The mayor and deputy mayor are elected bi-annually by the councillors at the first meeting of the council. The most recent election was held on 14 September 2024, and the makeup of the council is as follows:

The current Council, elected in 2024, in order of election, is:

==Council facilities==
The council operates a main library located on Rochester Street in Homebush. The library was demolished in 2002 and a new library was built and opened in 2004.

Historically, the municipality&#x27;s main library was located on Parramatta Road in Homebush, inherited from the former Homebush Municipality (which governed the northern part of the modern suburb of Homebush) after it merged into Strathfield in 1947. The Parramatta Road library served as the municipality&#x27;s main library until 1967, when the High Street library became the main library, and the Parramatta Road library was closed in 1976 after the Rochester Street library was opened.

The council formerly operated a branch library on High Street in Strathfield South, which was rebuilt and opened in 2008. However, the branch library was closed in 2019 and converted into a community centre, with some book lockers to continue some library services from this location.

The municipality&#x27;s main community centre, the Strathfield Community Centre, is located at 1B Bates Street, Homebush, in Airey Park.

The former South Strathfield Bowling Club was bought by Strathfield Council and renovated with a grant of $495,00 from the Department of Aging, Disability and Home Care. The building was opened as a community centre on 3 December 2012 and named in honour of Eve Dutton who was the first female mayor of Strathfield. This community centre gives priority access to services and programs for aged and disability groups. It houses Strathfield/Homebush Meals on Wheels and Inner West Community Transport.

==Culture==
The population of Strathfield is made up of a number of ethnic groups, and about 48% of the population born overseas. As a result, there are a number of services for newly arrived immigrants and overseas students who live in the area. Two such organisations are the Russian Ethnic Community Council of NSW Inc (RECNSW), and the Sydney Tamil Resource Centre Inc (STRC). RECNSW provides access to information and referral to mainstream services to recent immigrants of Russian and Russian speaking background and disseminates information to remote and offshore areas on a number of issues. STRC provides resources to Tamil immigrants. A number of the commercial centres in the Municipality of Strathfield feature concentrations of restaurants and shops with ethnically distinct character, such as the concentration of Korean restaurants and shops in the Strathfield town centre, and Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants and shops in the Flemington village centre. The Homebush village centre features cafes and restaurants serving a variety of cuisines (such as Chinese, Korean, Indian, Greek and Lebanese).

Strathfield also has a number of community centres, including a Rotary club, Latvian theatre, Lantern Club, and libraries. The local Rotary club provides support to the community and has a number of projects in the area, as well as a Musical Society (part of Rotary?), which normally produces two shows a year in the Latvian Theatre in Strathfield. Their main social activity is rehearsing twice weekly and they present seven performances of their musical production over two weekends. Strathfield Lantern Club Voluntary is located in Strathfield and provides fundraising organisation for raising funds specifically for the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children in North Rocks.

The lyrics of the song by Radio Birdman, &quot;Murder City Nights&quot; refers to Woodward Road, Strathfield:

:&quot;Cruising down Woodward gotta find me some action&quot;
:&quot;Looking for a lover with a power reaction.&quot;

==State and Federal government==
In the NSW Legislative Assembly, the Municipality of Strathfield mostly falls into the electorate of Strathfield, except the part of the suburb of Greenacre within council boundaries, which is in the electorate of Bankstown, and the northern part of Homebush (north of Parramatta Road) is in the electorate of Drummoyne.

For Federal elections it is in the electorates of Reid (north of Hume Highway) and Watson (south of Hume Highway).

<text>Free China Journal () was a periodical sponsored by the Kuomintang that was published in Taiwan after the Kuomintang retreat following their defeat in the Chinese Civil War.

The first issue appeared on 20 December 1949. The publisher was Hu Shih while the director and founder was Lei Chen, a member of the Kuomintang who was also close to Chiang Kai-shek. The publication was sponsored by the Kuomintang-led government to act as a forum for free thought and discussion against the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Its popularity soared as the editors and writers analyzed political situations at the time, sometimes even advising or criticizing the government in earnest.

The publication ceased in 1960 when the government forced a shut-down after Lei criticized Chiang Kai-shek for changing the constitution in order to allow him to run as President beyond the two terms previously mandated and sought to form with influential native Taiwanese politicians. Lei was also accused of promoting the formation of a &quot;Democratic State of Chinese Taiwan&quot; (中華臺灣民主國) to counter the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The final issue was published on September 1, 1960.

<doc id="607360" wikidata="Q2639209" url="?curid=607360" title="Pombero">
<text>The Pombero (Guarani: &quot;Pombéro&quot;) known also as Pomberito, Pyrague (&quot;hairy feet&quot;), Karai Pyhare (&quot;lord of the night&quot;), Kuarahy Jára (&quot;master of the sun&quot;) is a mythological being typical of Paraguay&#x27;s cultural heritage. Also known in the mythology of the Mbyá tribe of southern Brazil and the Argentinian province of (Misiones) and Cho Pombé (&quot;Don Pombero&quot;), it is a mythical humanoid creature of small stature in Guarani mythology. The legend, along with those of other mythological figures of the Guarani, is an important part of the culture of a region stretching from northeast Argentina northward through the whole of Paraguay and into southern Brazil. The Pombéro is said to capture particularly ungrateful girls, force them to kiss him, and later rape them.

== Name and appearance ==
Pombero&#x27;s original name in the Guaraní language is Karai Pyhare, &quot;The man of the Night&quot;, he is said to be a primarily nocturnal creature. In some parts of Argentina he is known primarily by the Spanish translation of his name, &quot;Señor de la noche&quot;. 

Although accounts of the Pombero&#x27;s appearance and nature vary slightly from one community to the next, he is usually described as being short and ugly, with very short arms and hairy hands and feet. His hairy feet are said to give him the ability to sneak up on people silently and the touch of his hairy hands to bring a cold shiver. The Pombero generally dwells in rural areas, living in the forest, although he will sometimes choose to inhabit an abandoned house.

As a forest dweller, the Pombero is said to be able to imitate the sounds of various forest creatures. Most specifically it is believed that the Pombero can imitate birdsong, especially those of a nocturnal variety, and as such is viewed as something of a protector of the birds. Many witnesses of the Pombero say that before he appears he whistles. Most are so frightened of gathering his wrath that they never whistle again. One common aspect of the myth among various Guaraní based societies is that the Pombero protects the birds from children who hunt them with slingshots.

The Pombero is generally viewed as a harmless . Owing to his preferred habitat of rural forests, the targets of his mischief tend to be rural farmers. Among his favourite activities are setting loose cattle, stealing eggs, chicken and honey, frightening horses and causing them to throw their riders off, as well as scattering corn, rice, or other provisions. The Pombero is also often accused of impregnating single women either by a mere touch of his hand or by tricking them into having sex with him, and it is said that babies who are born ugly and hairy are likely the result of a visit from the Pombero. Another character from Guaraní mythology, Kurupi, is blamed in a similar manner for unexpected or unexplained pregnancies. The Pombero is difficult, if not impossible, to detect due to his silent movements as well as other supernatural abilities, such as being able to turn invisible, squeeze through impossibly narrow spaces, or other such feats.

It is said that one can keep the Pombero from engaging in such mischief by leaving gifts out for him, most specifically cigars and rum, though honey is also an acceptable offering. Thus appeased, the Pombero will abstain from wreaking havoc upon one&#x27;s home and possessions. In some areas it is believed that repeated giving of these gifts can cause the Pombero to become friendly, to the point where he will guard over one&#x27;s home, animals, and possessions, and sometimes even leave gifts in return.

The Pombero tends to be the most widespread and pervasive of mythological figures among Guaraní speaking cultures today. In rural Paraguay, for example, it is not uncommon for adults to fervently believe in this myth, to the extent that they leave gifts of rum and cigars for the Pombero nightly.

== Pombero in popular culture ==
The Pombero myth has been studied in a documentary program on paranormal themes (especially cryptozoology) of the Sci-Fi channel called Destination Truth, in chapter 6 of its first season entitled «&quot;El Luisón/El Pombero&quot;».

The album &quot;Sr. Pombero&quot; (Mr. Pombero) of the Kchiporros band bases his name on this character.

In November 2020, Paraguayan game developer Inside Studios launched the video game &quot;Pombero – The Lord of Night&quot;, receiving mixed criticism.

<text>The Edible Woman is the first novel by Canadian writer Margaret Atwood, published in 1969. It is the story of a young woman, Marian, whose sane, structured, consumer-oriented world starts to slip out of focus. Following her engagement, Marian feels her body and her self are becoming separated. Marian begins endowing food with human qualities that cause her to identify with it, and finds herself unable to eat, repelled by metaphorical cannibalism. In a foreword written in 1979 for the Virago edition of the novel, Atwood described it as a protofeminist rather than feminist work.

Atwood explores gender stereotypes through characters who strictly adhere to them (such as Peter or Lucy) and those who defy their constraints (such as Ainsley or Duncan). The narrative point of view shifts from first to third person, accentuating Marian&#x27;s slow detachment from reality. At the conclusion, first person narration returns, consistent with the character&#x27;s willingness to take control of her life again. Food and clothing are major symbols used by the author to explore themes and grant the reader insight on each of the characters&#x27; personalities, moods, and motivations.

Setting is used to identify differences between the characters; for example, Duncan is encountered in a mundane laundromat, gloomy theatre or sleazy hotel. In comparison, Peter inhabits genteel bars and a sparkling new apartment. However these changing environments are also used to explore different angles of existence, contrasting a freer, wilder glimpse of life, with a civilised, gilded cage. This highlights the difficulties presented to women in the era, where freedom was synonymous with uncertainty but marriage presented problems of its own.

This novel&#x27;s publication coincided with the rise of the women&#x27;s movement in North America, but is described by Atwood as &quot;protofeminist&quot; because it was written in 1965 and thus anticipated second-wave feminism.

== Background ==
From 1963 to 1964, Atwood worked for Canadian Facts, a Toronto-based survey research firm, fact-checking and editing survey questionnaires. Canadian Facts had a similar work environment to the fictional Seymour Surveys where Marian worked. In &quot;Margaret Atwood: A Critical Companion&quot;, Nathalie Cooke argues that the characters of Peter, Lucy, and Mrs. Sims were drawn from people in Atwood&#x27;s life—Peter being a fictionalized version of Atwood&#x27;s boyfriend (also an amateur photographer) and later fiancé.
It is also likely that the name of her roommate and friend Ainsley was inspired by Annesley Hall at Victoria University in the University of Toronto, to which Atwood belonged. The all-female residence building, which was built in 1903, was the first university residence building for women in Canada.

==Plot summary==
Marian MacAlpin works in a market research firm, writing survey questions and sampling products. She shares the top-floor apartment of a house in Toronto (never named in the novel) with her roommate Ainsley and dates a dependable, hardworking but boring boyfriend, Peter. Marian also keeps in touch with Clara, a friend from college, who is now a constantly pregnant housewife.

Ainsley announces she wants to have a baby—and intends to do it without getting married. When Marian is horrified, Ainsley replies, &quot;The thing that ruins families these days is the husbands.&quot; Looking for a man who will have no interest in fatherhood, she sets her sights on Marian&#x27;s &quot;womanizer&quot; friend Len, who is infamous for his relationships with young, naive girls.

At work, Marian is assigned the task of gathering responses for a survey about a new brand of beer. While walking from house to house asking people their opinions, she meets Duncan, a graduate student in English who intrigues her with his atypical and eccentric answers.

Marian later has a dinner date with Peter and Len, during which Ainsley shows up dressed as a virginal schoolgirl—the first stage of her plan to trick Len into impregnating her. Marian finds herself disassociating from her body as Peter recounts a gory rabbit hunt to Len:

Marian runs from the restaurant and is chased down by Peter in his car. Unaware of Ainsley&#x27;s plan to get pregnant by Len, Peter chides, &quot;Ainsley behaved herself properly, why couldn&#x27;t you?&quot;

At the end of the night, Peter proposes to her. When asked to choose a date for the wedding, Marian slips into unexpected passivity:

Marian and Duncan have a surprise meeting in a laundromat, engage in awkward conversation, and kiss. Shortly afterwards, Marian&#x27;s problems with food begin when she finds herself empathizing with a steak that Peter is eating, imagining it &quot;knocked on the head as it stood in a queue like someone waiting for a streetcar.&quot; After this, she is unable to eat meat – anything with &quot;bone or tendon or fiber&quot;.

Ainsley&#x27;s plot to seduce Len succeeds. When Len later learns that Ainsley is pregnant, he talks to Marian, who confesses that pregnancy was Ainsley&#x27;s plan all along. Len reveals his childhood fear of eggs, and from that point Marian can no longer face her soft-boiled egg in the morning. Soon thereafter, she is unable to eat vegetables or cake.

Peter decides to throw a party, to which Marian invites &quot;the office virgins&quot; from her work, Duncan, and Duncan&#x27;s roommates. Peter suggests that Marian buy herself a new dress for his party – something less &quot;mousy&quot; than her normal wardrobe. Marian submits to his wishes and buys a daring red dress. Before the party, Ainsley does Marian&#x27;s makeup, including false eyelashes and a big lipsticked smile. When Duncan arrives, he says, &quot;You didn&#x27;t tell me it was a masquerade. Who the hell are you supposed to be?&quot; He leaves and Marian follows. They end up going to a sleazy hotel, where they have unsatisfying sex. The next morning, they go out to breakfast and Marian finds that she cannot eat anything.

After Duncan leaves, Marian decides that Peter is metaphorically devouring her. To test him, she bakes a pink cake in the shape of a woman and dares him to eat it. &quot;This is what you really want&quot;, she says, offering the cake woman as a substitute to him feeding upon her. Peter leaves disturbed. Once Peter leaves, Marian feels hungry and realizes it&#x27;s just a cake so she starts eating it.

Marian returns to her first person narrative in the closing pages of the book. Duncan shows up at her apartment; Marian offers him the remains of the cake, which he polishes off. &quot;&#x27;Thank you,&#x27; he said, licking his lips. &#x27;It was delicious.&#x27;&quot;

==Themes==
===Loss of identity===
Marian&#x27;s refusal to eat can be viewed as her resistance to being coerced into a more feminine role. In a description of Peter&#x27;s apartment, Marian describes the &quot;clutter of raw materials&quot; that had, through &quot;digestion and assimilation&quot;, become the walls of the lobby. She sees that consumption precedes construction: the body&#x27;s assimilation of raw materials (food) is analogous to the social body&#x27;s assimilation and processing of women into socially acceptable feminine subjects. By not eating, Marian refuses to take in the raw materials used to re-construct her into a role of domesticity. This struggle is made explicit when one of Duncan&#x27;s roommates expounds on &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; as having a &quot;sexual-identity crisis&quot;, then goes on to describe the structure of both &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;The Edible Woman&quot;: &quot;One sexual role after another is presented [to the heroine] but she seems unable to accept any of them.&quot; Marian is shaped first by her parents&#x27; plans for her future, then by Peter&#x27;s. Once married, Marian fears Peter&#x27;s strong personality will obliterate her own fragile identity. This subconscious perception of Peter as predator is manifested by Marian&#x27;s body as an inability to eat, as a gesture of solidarity with other prey. Following her engagement, the switch to third-person narrative shows that Marian&#x27;s story is controlled by someone other than Marian herself; following Marian&#x27;s regaining of identity, Atwood returns to first-person narration.

===Alienation===
In the transitions from first person to third person, Atwood demonstrates Marian&#x27;s growing alienation from her body. At the company Christmas party, Marian looks around at the other women, thinking &quot;You were green and then you ripened: became mature. Dresses for the mature figure. In other words, fat.&quot; Marian refuses to become likewise, which would transform her into a woman and as such be constrained by a sexist culture. Marian is, therefore, alienated from nature as she places herself outside the process of maturation.

<text>Sultan Abu Al-Nasr Sayf ad-Din Al-Ashraf Qaitbay (; 1416/14187 August 1496) was the eighteenth Burji Mamluk Sultan of Egypt from 872 to 901 A.H. (1468–1496 C.E.). He was Circassian by birth, and was purchased by the ninth sultan Barsbay (1422 to 1438 C.E.) before being freed by the eleventh Sultan Jaqmaq (1438 to 1453 C.E.). A pious Sultan, he stabilized the Mamluk state and economy, consolidated the northern boundaries of the Sultanate with the Ottoman Empire, engaged in trade with other contemporaneous polities. Founding numerous religious buildings and endowing them with hundreds of waqfs, Qaitbay emerged as a great patron of art and architecture. In fact, although Qaitbay fought sixteen military campaigns, he is best remembered for the spectacular building projects that he sponsored, leaving his mark as an architectural patron on Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem, Damascus, Aleppo, Alexandria, and every quarter of Cairo.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Qaitbay was born between 1416 and 1418 in Circassia, located in the Caucasus. His skill in archery and horsemanship attracted the attention of a slave merchant who purchased him (Black Sea slave trade) and brought him to Cairo when he was already over twenty years of age. He was quickly purchased by the reigning sultan Barsbay and became a member of the palace guard. He was freed by Barsbay&#x27;s successor, Jaqmaq, after learning that Qaitbay was a descendant of the Ayyubid Emir of Damascus Al-Ashraf Musa (d. 1237), and appointed the third executive secretary; under the reigns of Sayf ad-Din Inal, Khushqadam and Yilbay, he was further promoted through the Mamluk military hierarchy, eventually becoming &quot;taqaddimat alf&quot;, commander of a thousand Mamluks. Under the Sultan Timurbugha, finally, Qaitbay was appointed &quot;atabak&quot;, or field marshal of the entire Mamluk army. During this period, Qaitbay amassed a considerable personal fortune which would enable him to exercise substantial acts of beneficence as sultan without draining the royal treasury.

===Accession===

The reign of Timurbugha lasted less than two months, as he was dethroned in a palace coup on 30 January 1468. Qaitbay was proposed as a compromise candidate acceptable to the various court factions. Despite some apparent reluctance, he was enthroned on 31 January. Qaitbay insisted that Timurburgha be granted an honorable retirement, instead of the enforced exile usually imposed on dethroned sovereigns. He did, however, exile the leaders of the coup, and created a new ruling council composed of his own followers and more veteran courtiers who had fallen into disgrace under his predecessors. Yashbak min Mahdi was appointed &quot;dawadar&quot;, or executive secretary, and Azbak min Tutkh was named &quot;atabak&quot;; the two men would remain Qaitbay&#x27;s closest advisors until the ends of their careers, despite their profound dislike for each other. In general Qaitbay seems to have pursued a policy of appointing rivals to posts of equal authority, thus preventing any single subordinate from acquiring too much power and maintaining the ability to settle all disputes via his own autocratic authority.

===Early reign===
Qaitbay&#x27;s first major challenge was the insurrection of Shah Suwar, leader of a small Turkmen dynasty, the Dhu&#x27;l-Qadrids, in eastern Anatolia. A first expedition against the upstart was soundly defeated, and Suwar threatened to invade Syria. A second Mamluk army was sent in 1469 under the leadership of Azbak, but was likewise defeated. Not until 1471 did a third expedition, this time commanded by Yashbak, succeed in routing Suwar&#x27;s army. In 1473, Suwar was captured and led back to Cairo, together with his brothers; the prisoners were drawn and quartered and their remains were hung from Bab Zuwayla.

Qaitbay&#x27;s reign was also marked by trade with other contemporaneous polities. Excavations in the late 1800s and early 1900s at over fourteen sites in the vicinity of Borama in modern-day northwestern Somalia unearthed, among other things, coins identified as having been derived from Qaitbay. Most of these finds are associated with the medieval Sultanate of Adal, and were sent to the British Museum in London for preservation shortly after their discovery.

===Consolidation of power===
Following the defeat of Suwar, Qaitbay set about purging his court of the remaining factions and installing his own purchased Mamluks in all positions of power. He frequently went on excursions, ostentatiously leaving the Citadel with limited guards to display his trust of his subordinates and of the populace. He traveled throughout his reign, visiting Alexandria, Damascus, and Aleppo, among other cities, and personally inspecting his many building projects. In 1472 he performed the Hajj to Mecca. He was struck by the poverty of the citizens of Medina and devoted a substantial portion of his private fortune to the alleviation of their plight. Through such measures Qaitbay gained a reputation for piety, charity, and royal self-confidence.

===Ottoman-Mamluk war===

In 1480 Yashbak led an army against the Aq Qoyunlu dynasty in Northern Mesopotamia, but was soundly defeated while attacking Urfa, taken prisoner, and executed. These events foreshadowed a longer military engagement with the far more powerful Ottoman Empire in Anatolia. In 1485 Ottoman armies began to campaign on the Mamluk frontier, and an expedition was dispatched from Cairo to confront them. These Mamluk troops won a surprising victory in 1486 near Adana. A temporary truce ensued, but in 1487 the Ottomans reoccupied Adana, only to be defeated once more by a massive Mamluk army. As the concomitant Ottoman expansion in the western Mediterranean represented an increased threat to the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, Ferdinand II of Aragon made a temporary alliance with the Mamluks against the Ottomans from 1488 until 1491, shipping wheat and offering a fleet of 50 caravels against the Ottomans.

In 1491 a final truce was signed that would last through the remaining reigns of Qaitbay and the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II. Qaitbay&#x27;s ability to enforce a peace with the greatest military power in the Muslim world further enhanced his prestige at home and abroad.

===Final years===

The end of Qaitbay&#x27;s reign was marred by increasing unrest among his troops and a decline in his personal health, including a riding accident that left him comatose for days. Many of his most trusted officials died, and were replaced by far less scrupulous upstarts; a long period of palace intrigue ensued. In 1492 the plague returned to Cairo, and was reported to have claimed 200,000 lives. Qaitbay&#x27;s health became markedly poor in 1494, and his court, now lacking a figure of central authority, was wracked by infighting, factionalism, and purges.

He died on 8 August 1496 and was interred in the spectacular mausoleum attached to his mosque in Cairo&#x27;s Northern Cemetery which he had built during his lifetime. He was succeeded by his son, an-Nasir Muhammad (not to be confused with the famed 14th-century sultan of the same name.)

==Family==
One of his wives was the daughter of Sultan Sayf ad-Din Inal. Another consort was Khawand Aṣalbāy, a Circassian, who was his slave concubine rather than his wife, and sister of Sultan Abu Sa&#x27;id Qansuh. She was the mother of his son, Sultan Sultan An-Nasir Muhammad. After Qaitbay&#x27;s death, she married Sultan Al-Ashraf Janbalat. Another wife was Khawand Fatima, the daughter of Ala al-Din Ali bin Ali bin Al-Khassbak. She was the mother of Ahmed (1462 – 1468) and Sitt al-Jarakisa (1464 – 1468). After Qaitbay&#x27;s death, she married Sultans Tuman bay I and Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghuri. She died on 6 June 1504. Another wife was Khawand Zaynab.

==Legacy==

Qaitbay&#x27;s reign has traditionally been seen as the &quot;happy culmination&quot; of the Burji Mamluk dynasty. It was a period of unparalleled political stability, military success, and prosperity, and Qaitbay&#x27;s contemporaries admired him as a defender of traditional Mamluk values. At the same time, he may be criticized for his conservatism, and for his failure to innovate in the face of new challenges. Following Qaitbay&#x27;s death, the Mamluk state descended into a prolonged succession crisis lasting for five years until the accession of Al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri.

=== Architectural patronage ===
Today Qaitbay is perhaps best known for his wide-ranging architectural patronage, which was second only to al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun. At least 230 monuments, either surviving or mentioned in contemporary sources, are associated with his reign. In Egypt, Qaitbay&#x27;s buildings are found throughout Cairo, as well as in Alexandria and Rosetta; in Syria he sponsored projects in Aleppo and Damascus; in addition, he was responsible for the construction of madrasas and fountains in Jerusalem and Gaza, which still stand – most notably the Fountain (sabil) of Qayt Bay and al-Ashrafiyya Madrasa. On the Arabian peninsula, Qaitbay sponsored the restoration of mosques and the construction of madrasas, fountains and hostels in Mecca and Medina. After a serious fire struck the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina in 1481, the building, including the Tomb of the Prophet, was extensively renewed through Qaitbay&#x27;s patronage.

One of Qaytbay&#x27;s largest building projects in Cairo was his funerary complex in the Northern Cemetery, which included his mausoleum, a mosque/madrasa, a &quot;maq&#x27;ad&quot; (reception hall), and various auxiliary structures and functions attached to it. It is considered a masterpiece of late Mamluk architecture and is featured today on Egypt&#x27;s 1 pound note. His other contributions in Cairo include a Wikala at Bab al-Nasr, a Wikala-Sabil-Kuttab near al-Azhar Mosque, a Sabil-Kuttab on Saliba street, a madrasa-mosque at Qal&#x27;at al-Kabsh, a mosque on Rhoda Island, and a palace that is now incorporated into the Bayt Al-Razzaz palace. Other amirs and patrons also built notable projects under his reign, such as the Mosque of Amir Qijmas al-Ishaqi, which feature the same refined architectural style of his time. In Alexandria he notably built a fortress on the site of the ruined Pharos, now known as the Citadel (or Fort) of Qaitbay.

Qaitbay In Ethiopic Sources

Qaitbay is mentioned in Ethiopic sources as አሽሪፍ (Ashrif) and እልአሽሪፍ (El-Ashrif) a cruel ruler who destroyed the famous church of Dayr al-Magtas (ደብረ ምጥማቅ). Hearing the news of the church&#x27;s destruction the Ethiopian ruler Zara Yaqob built another church in Ethiopia to console the sorrow of the Egyptian bishop Michael who served in the church before he was sent to Ethiopia by the Coptic Patriarchate. The Ethiopic source accurately describes the political instability of Qaitbay&#x27;s rule in the final days.

<doc id="607372" wikidata="Q1748680" url="?curid=607372" title="John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont">
<text>John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont (24 or 25 February 17114 December 1770) was a British politician, political pamphleteer, and genealogist who served as First Lord of the Admiralty. Of Anglo-Irish background, he sat in both the Irish and British Parliaments. He was the father of the Regency Era Prime Minister Spencer Perceval.

==Early life==
He was the son and heir of John Perceval, 1st Earl of Egmont, by his wife Catherine Parker. He was baptised at the Palace of Westminster, London. His two siblings were Lady Catharine Perceval (wife of Thomas Hanmer MP of The Fenns) and Lady Helena Perceval (wife of John Rawdon, 1st Earl of Moira).

His paternal grandparents were Sir John Perceval, 3rd Baronet of Lohort Castle and the former Catherine Dering (daughter of Sir Edward Dering, 2nd Baronet). His maternal grandparents were Sir Philip Parker, 2nd Baronet of Arwarton and the former Mary Fortray (a daughter of landowner and author Samuel Fortrey of Byall Fen).

He succeeded his father in 1748 as 2nd Earl of Egmont in the Peerage of Ireland.

== Career ==

Perceval sat in the Irish House of Commons for Dingle between 1731 and 1749. In April 1748, he was created Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales. He was made a Privy Counsellor in January 1755.

He sat in the Parliament of Ireland for Dingle (1731–49) and in the House of Commons for Westminster (1741–47), Weobley (1747–54) and Bridgwater (1754–62). In 1762 he was created Baron Lovel and Holland, of Enmore in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. 
From 1751 to 1757, he designed and created Enmore Castle at Enmore in Somerset, which received &quot;the dismissive mockery of Horace Walpole&quot;.

He was appointed joint Postmaster-General for 1762–3 alongside Robert Hampden, 4th Baron Trevor and served as First Lord of the Admiralty from 1763 to 1766. As First Sea Lord, places named in his honour were Port Egmont, the first British settlement in the Falkland Islands and Mount Taranaki in New Zealand, which was named Mount Egmont by Captain James Cook in 1770 during his first voyage around the world.

==Personal life==

Perceval married twice. His first marriage was on 15 February 1737 to Lady Catherine Cecil, who was the second daughter of James Cecil, 5th Earl of Salisbury. Before her death on 16 August 1752, aged 33, they had five sons and two daughters:

* John Perceval, 3rd Earl of Egmont (29 January 1738 – 25 February 1822), eldest son and heir.
* Cecil Parker Perceval (19 October 1739 – 4 March 1753), died at Eton College.
* Philip Tufton Perceval (10 March 1742 –1795), a captain in the Royal Navy.
* Edward Perceval, (21 April 1744 –1824), a captain in the Royal Dragoon Guards, who married Sarah Howarth, daughter of John Howarth, in 1775.
* Catherine Perceval (20 February 1746 –1782), who married Thomas Wynn (1736–1807) (afterwards 1st Baron Newborough), in 1766.
*Margaret Perceval (10 October 1748 –1750).
*Frederick Augustus Perceval (11 February 1750 –1757).
His second marriage was to Catherine Compton, the third daughter of the Hon. Charles Compton and sister of Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton and Spencer Compton, 8th Earl of Northampton, on 26 January 1756. By Catherine Compton he had three sons and six daughters as follows:

* Charles George Perceval (1756–1840), eldest son, who succeeded his mother as Baron Arden in the peerage of Ireland, and was created a peer of the United Kingdom, with the title of Baron Arden of Arden in the county of Warwick
* Mary Perceval (d. 1839), who married Andrew Berkeley Drummond of Cadlands, Hampshire, a grandson of William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan (died 1746), in 1781.
* Anne Perceval (15 December 1759 – 1 August 1772).
* Charlotte Perceval (b. 31 January 1761, d. 1761), who died an infant.
*Spencer Perceval (1762–1812), who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from October 1809 to May 1812.
* Elizabeth Perceval (d. 1846), who died aged 82, unmarried. 
*Henry Perceval (1765–1772), who died aged 7. 
* Frances Perceval (b. 4 December 1767, d. 1817), who married John, 1st Baron Redesdale in 1803.
* Margaret Perceval (b. 17 March 1769, d. 1854), who married Thomas Walpole, sometime ambassador at Munich, a nephew of Horatio Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford, in 1803.

Lord Perceval died on 4 December 1770 at Pall Mall, London, aged 59. Following his death, his widow was created on 23 May 1770 Baroness Arden of Lohort Castle in the county of Cork in the peerage of Ireland, with remainder to her heirs male. She survived her husband and died at Langley, Buckinghamshire, on 11 June 1784, aged 53.

===Legacy===
Port Egmont in the Falkland Islands, established in 1765, is named after him. 

Mount Egmont in New Zealand was named after him by James Cook in recognition of his encouragement of Cook&#x27;s first voyage. While the mountain has returned to its original Maori name of Taranaki since the 2000s, the Egmont name still applies to the national park that surrounds the peak and geologists still refer to the peak as the Egmont Volcano.

<text>Wayne Maxwell Swan (born 30 June 1954) is an Australian politician serving as the 25th and current National President of the Labor Party since 2018, previously serving as the 14th deputy prime minister of Australia and the deputy leader of the Labor Party from 2010 to 2013, and the treasurer of Australia from 2007 to 2013.

Swan was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1993 for Lilley in Queensland, although he lost this seat in 1996. He regained the seat in 1998 and represented it until retiring in 2019. Following Labor&#x27;s victory in 2007, Swan was appointed Treasurer of Australia by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. In this position, he played a key role in Australia&#x27;s response to the Global Financial Crisis throughout 2008 and 2009. In 2010, after Julia Gillard became Prime Minister, Swan was elected unopposed as Labor&#x27;s deputy leader and was subsequently sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister. In 2011, Swan was named Finance Minister of the Year by &quot;Euromoney&quot; magazine, joining Paul Keating as the only Australian Treasurer to have been awarded that title. After Rudd successfully challenged Gillard for the leadership in June 2013, Swan resigned from the Cabinet.

==Early life and career==
Swan was born and educated in Nambour, Queensland. He attended Nambour State High School and graduated in 1972. Kevin Rudd attended the same school at the same time, though was three years younger than Swan and the two did not know each other.

Swan won a Commonwealth scholarship to study Public Administration at the University of Queensland, where he resided at Emmanuel College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. After graduating he worked as a lecturer in the Department of Management at the Queensland Institute of Technology. From 1978 to 1980, Swan acted as a policy adviser to Labor Leader Bill Hayden, and from 1983 to 1984 was an adviser to Government Ministers Mick Young and Kim Beazley. He later worked as the State Secretary of the Queensland Labor Party from 1991 to 1993.

==Political career==
===Parliament===

Swan was first elected as the Member for Lilley in the 1993 federal election, but was defeated three years later by Elizabeth Grace in what was a large defeat for Labor nationwide. In 1996, Swan donated $500–$1400 (amount disputed) to the Australian Democrats campaign manager in his seat of Lilley. At the time, speculation surrounded the nature of the donation. The matter was referred to the Australian Federal Police who chose to take no further action. He worked as an adviser to Labor Leader Kim Beazley before contesting Lilley again in the 1998 federal election and regaining the seat.

===Shadow Cabinet===
Kim Beazley promoted Swan to the Shadow Cabinet in 1998. Initially serving as Shadow Minister for Family and Community Services, he became the Manager of Opposition Business in 2001. During the 2003 Labor leadership spills he was a prominent supporter of Kim Beazley, but retained his position in the Shadow Cabinet when Mark Latham became the new leader. After the 2004 federal election defeat, Swan was promoted to become Shadow Treasurer. This was seen by many as a surprise, as it was rumoured that Latham was intending to appoint then-Shadow Health Minister Julia Gillard to the position. It was believed that strong opposition from Labor&#x27;s Right Faction had put Latham under pressure to appoint either Swan or Shadow Industrial Relations Minister Stephen Smith to the position. Early in the role, Swan worked to devise Labor&#x27;s response to the Howard government&#x27;s 2006 budget, with Labor proposing tax relief for low- and middle-income earners. Swan launched his book during the same month, &quot;&quot;.

After Kevin Rudd successfully challenged Kim Beazley to win the leadership of the Labor Party in December 2006, he reappointed Swan as Shadow Treasurer. In early November 2007, Swan and Rudd revisited their old high school in Nambour. Rudd gave a speech to students, in which he said that, while at school, &quot;Wayne was very, very cool; and I was very, very not&quot;.

===Treasurer===
Following Labor&#x27;s landslide win in the 2007 federal election, Swan was appointed Treasurer of Australia by Kevin Rudd on 3 December 2007.

Swan&#x27;s first budget concentrated on inflationary pressures in the economy, with substantially reduced spending that exceeded the A$11 billion outlaid for tax cuts. The policy debate shifted around August 2008 after mortgage lending banks in the United States began to collapse and economic activity faltered as American investments were written off. In response to the resulting global downturn, Swan coordinated an &quot;economic security strategy&quot; worth $10 billion in October 2008. Designed as a stimulus package and directed towards retail sales, it was largely supported by the International Monetary Fund. When the December quarterly growth report showed the economy contracting, he moved ahead with the Nation Building and Jobs Plan to provide government-sponsored work worth A$42 billion. This action was widely credited with preventing Australia from following much of the world into recession, as the March 2009 quarterly growth report showed that the economy had returned to growth.

On 20 September 2011, Swan was named Finance Minister of the Year by &quot;Euromoney&quot; magazine, joining Paul Keating as the only Australian Treasurer to have been conferred that title.

In March 2012, Swan became the first treasurer or deputy prime minister to be ejected from the House of Representatives, after he referred to Andrew Robb, the then-opposition finance spokesperson, as &quot;Curly&quot;, in reference to The Three Stooges.

In an essay published in &quot;The Monthly&quot; magazine in March 2012, Swan criticised the rising influence of vested interests, in particular paying attention to mining entrepreneurs Clive Palmer, Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest, and how Swan believed they are threatening Australia&#x27;s egalitarian social contract. and a subsequent address to the National Press Club, In &quot;The Monthly&quot; essay he opined:
The latest example of this is the foray by Australia’s richest person, Gina Rinehart, into Fairfax Media, reportedly in an attempt to wield greater influence on public opinion and further her commercial interests at a time when the overwhelming economic consensus is that it&#x27;s critical to use the economic weight of the resources boom to strengthen the entire economy.
Politicians have a choice: between exploiting divisions by promoting fear and appealing to the sense of fairness and decency that is the foundation of our middle-class society; between standing up for workers and kneeling down at the feet of the Gina Rineharts and the Clive Palmers.
For every Andrew Forrest who wails about high company taxes and then admits to not paying any, there are a hundred Australian businesspeople who held on to their employees and worked with government to keep the doors of Australian business open during the GFC. Despite the howling of a small minority, the vast bulk of the resources industry is in the cart for more efficient profits-based resource taxation which serves to strengthen our entire economy. The vast majority of our miners accept that they have a social obligation to pay their fair share of tax on the resources Australians own.

===Deputy Prime Minister===

On 23 June 2010, Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard challenged Kevin Rudd for the leadership of the Labor Party. Realising that he no longer had enough support to retain his position, Rudd resigned the following day, allowing Gillard to be elected unopposed. Swan stood to fill the vacant position of Deputy Leader, and was also elected unopposed. He was sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister of Australia later that day. Days later, Swan attended the G20 Toronto Summit in Gillard&#x27;s place. He would regularly stand in for Gillard as Acting Prime Minister for the next three years.

===Resignation and retirement===

Swan resigned from his positions to return to the backbench following the return of Kevin Rudd to the leadership in June 2013. After Labor lost the 2013 federal election, he remained in Parliament and retained his seat at the 2016 federal election. On 10 February 2018, he announced that he would not contest the 2019 federal election and that he would retire from politics.

===Personal collection===
Swan donated his personal collection of records to the State Library of Queensland&#x27;s John Oxley Library. The collection reflects the history of Swan&#x27;s time in public office and in particular is a record of his experience as: Secretary of the Queensland Labor Party (1991–1993) Federal MP and Member for the seat of Lilley from 1993 to 1996, 1998–2019, Treasurer of Australia (2007–2013), Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of the ALP (2010–2013) and National President of the Australian Labor Party (2018–present). A substantial part of the collection relates to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–2009 and is highly significant given that Australia was a key contributor to G20 discussions. The collection includes photographs, correspondence, campaign materials and political documents. In 2021 the State Library produced a digital story with Swan. The interview by Dennis Atkins covers Swan&#x27;s time in public office and his life before and after politics as well as the Global Financial Crisis of 2008–09 and Swan&#x27;s role in the implementation of an effective domestic stimulus response to the crisis.

==Later activities==

In June 2018, Swan was elected national president of the ALP, defeating incumbent president Mark Butler. According to Guardian political editor Katharine Murphy, he &quot;prevailed in a contest where the left faction normally dominates by appealing to progressive rank-and-file ALP members courtesy of his relentless campaigning on inequality&quot;. He was re-elected to a further term as president in April 2023. In June 2024 he publicly criticised the Albanese government&#x27;s Future Gas Strategy, stating that Australia should not be expanding gas production.

In August 2021, it was announced that Swan would be appointed chairman of Cbus, a superannuation fund associated with the construction industry, with effect from January 2022. He replaced former Victorian premier Steve Bracks in the role. In November 2024, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) sued Cbus over claims that it had mishandled disability and death benefit claims. Swan was subsequently called to give testimony on the matter before the Senate Economics Committee, during which he publicly apologised for the delays in payments of claims.

Swan is married to Kim and has three children. An earlier marriage, when he was 21, lasted for one year.

At age 48, Swan was diagnosed with prostate cancer but has since fully recovered. He has become an advocate for the prostate cancer public awareness campaign.

Swan has admitted to smoking cannabis.

<doc id="607405" wikidata="Q4904289" url="?curid=607405" title="Bidwell–Sacramento River State Park">
<text>Bidwell–Sacramento River State Park is a state park of California, United States, preserving riparian habitat on the Sacramento River and its tributary Big Chico Creek. The park is located on the border of Butte County and Glenn County. Common activities include fishing for salmon, steelhead and shad; and floating the river on inner tubes, canoes or kayaks. The property was established as a state park in 1979.

The park&#x27;s riparian habitat is an example of a disappearing natural resource. The riparian plant and animal communities depend on each other. Large oaks and cottonwoods give the shade needed for the survival of cool-water creatures. Thick understories of elderberry, wild grape, blackberry, wild rose and perennials provide shelter to a diverse wildlife population.

==Day use areas==
Indian Fishery Day Use Area is an oxbow lake surrounded by oak woodland. This area is used for picnicking, bird watching, fishing, and hiking. It is common to observe river otters in the water, to see turtles or to spot herons feeding.

Big Chico Creek Day Use Area is characterized by a river habitat that opens up to a large gravel bar that fronts the Sacramento River. Here park visitors fish, swim, jet ski, water ski and sun bathe. This is also the location that many river rafts and tubes exit the river.

Pine Creek Day Use Area is a common location for fishing, canoeing, kayaking, picnicking and bird and wildlife watching.

Irvine Finch River Access is a parking lot and launch ramp affording park visitors a means to access the Sacramento River for boating, canoeing or floating on inner tubes.

<doc id="607410" wikidata="Q722990" url="?curid=607410" title="2004 Ashura massacre">
<text>The Ashura massacre of March 2, 2004 in Iraq was a series of planned terrorist explosions that killed at least 80–100 and injured at least 200 Iraqi Shi&#x27;a Muslims commemorating the Day of Ashura. The bombings brought one of the deadliest days in the Iraq occupation after the Iraq War to topple Saddam Hussein.

==The attacks==
Nine explosions were detonated in Karbala, accompanied by mortar, grenade, and rocket fire, killing over 100 people, while three explosions near the Kadhimiya Shrine in Baghdad killed 58 more. Though the attack involved armed squads, car bombs, and up to a dozen suicide bombers, there was also an explosive-laden vehicle which was intercepted while trying to enter Basra, as were two suicide bombers in Karbala and others in Baghdad who had entered via Syria. The squads armed with rockets and small arms were meant to kill those wounded by the blasts as well as to trap those trying to flee the carnage.

Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt, the American commander in Baghdad, accused Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as being &quot;one of the chief suspects&quot; involved in directing the attacks. Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a highly influential Shiite in Iraq, blamed the U.S. for allowing the attacks to occur, but Kimmitt had agreed with Shiite leaders to vacate the shrines out of respect for cultural differences.

US appointed Iraqi governing council condemned the attacks and announced a mourning period of three days. Due to this decision, the signing of an interim Iraqi constitution, which had been scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed as confirmed by Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, a council member.

<text>Big Basin Redwoods State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of California, located in Santa Cruz County, about northwest of Santa Cruz. The park contains almost all of the Waddell Creek watershed, which was formed by the seismic uplift of its rim, and the erosion of its center by the many streams in its bowl-shaped depression.

Big Basin is California&#x27;s oldest state park, established in 1902, earning its designation as a California Historical Landmark. Its original have been increased over the years to over . It is part of the Northern California coastal forests ecoregion and is home to the largest continuous stand of ancient coast redwoods south of San Francisco. It contains of old-growth forest as well as recovering redwood forest, with mixed conifer, oaks, chaparral and riparian habitats. Elevations in the park vary from sea level to over 600 m (2,000 ft). The climate ranges from foggy and damp near the ocean to sunny, warm ridge tops.

The park has over of trails. Some of these trails link Big Basin to Castle Rock State Park and the eastern reaches of the Santa Cruz range. The Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail threads its way through the park along Waddell Creek to Waddell Beach, and the adjacent Theodore J. Hoover Natural Preserve, a freshwater marsh.

The park has many waterfalls, a wide variety of environments (from lush canyon bottoms to sparse chaparral-covered slopes), many species of mammals (deer, raccoons, an occasional bobcat) and abundant bird life – including Steller&#x27;s jays, egrets, herons and acorn woodpeckers.

The CZU Lightning Complex fires in August 2020 burned over 97% of Big Basin and destroyed the park headquarters, closing the park for 2 years during rebuilding efforts before it reopened in Summer 2022.

== History ==
Archaeological evidence has sporadically found prehistoric people inhabited old growth forests within the Park. Numerous resources would have been available to California Indians in the old growth forests, such as basketry material, plant foods like acorns and bulbs as well as animal prey for hunters and perhaps traditional sacred places. Ohlone tribes that lived on watercourses which begin in the park were the Quiroste, Achistaca, Cotoni and Sayante. In October 1769, the Portola expedition encountered the redwoods of southern Santa Cruz County, and camped at the mouth of Waddell Creek, in present-day Big Basin, later that month. Although many in the party had been ill with scurvy, they gorged themselves on berries and quickly recovered. This miraculous recovery, as it seemed at the time, inspired the name given to the valley: &#x27;Cañada de la Salud&#x27; or Canyon of Health.

By the late 19th century, redwood forests were gaining international appreciation while also being decimated. Early conservationists, including notable Santa Cruzans William T. Jeter and A.A. Taylor were joined by Santa Clara County activists Andrew P. Hill, Father Robert Kenna and Carrie Stevens Walter. Their movement to preserve the Big Basin redwood forest began at Stanford University on May 1, Soon after Santa Cruzans led an excursion to the park where seven men and two women formed the Sempervirens Club. The Sempervirens galvanized the state-wide effort resulting in ground-breaking legislation being signed into law in March 1901. The official land transfer occurred in 1902: The California Redwood Park initially consisted of , most of it old growth forest.

In the following decades, visitation to Big Basin grew steadily as park amenities were developed. The Big Basin Inn offered cabins to rent, a restaurant, general store, barber shop, gas station and photographic studio. There were also a post office, a concrete swimming pool, boating areas, tennis courts and a dance floor. Campsites cost 50 cents a night in 1927 and many families stayed all summer. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps assigned a company to Big Basin. These men built the amphitheater, miles of trails, and many of the buildings still used today. The main administration building, built by the CCC in 1936, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places prior to its destruction in the 2020 fires.

Save the Redwoods League purchased a parcel known as Cascade Creek in 2020 that links Big Basin with Año Nuevo State Park.
=== 2020 CZU Lightning Complex Wildfire ===
The CZU Lightning Complex fires started on August 16, 2020 and burned 86,509 acres across Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties. The fire spread quickly, and the area was evacuated on August 18. On August 20, it was reported that the park&#x27;s historic headquarters building had been completely destroyed, and the campgrounds around the park were extensively damaged. After actively burning for 37 days, the fires were contained on September 22. Over 97% of Big Basin was burned and nearly every structure was destroyed.

This was the first major wildfire in Big Basin in over 100 years, which had previously burned in 1904. This led to a greater intensity of the CZU fires, causing severe damage to the majority of the old growth trees. While some of the trees fell during and after the fires, the majority of the ancient redwoods remain standing. However, studies have shown that only 24% of the forest in Big Basin is still alive and regrowing due to the intensity of the fires and drought in the following years, and the old growth forest may never fully recover.

An April 2021 backcountry tour revealed the scorched landscape and the hundred structures destroyed, and the park superintendent estimated it might be up to a year before the public will be allowed safe access to park trails. The burnt wreckage of 1,490 structures and 15,000 charred trees, mainly Douglas fir, had fallen or were in danger of falling onto the hiking trails. One year after the fire, the clean up and rebuilding process began. The park remained closed to the public until July 22, 2022. Almost two years after the fire, Big Basin partially reopened 8 hiking trails for day use.

== Flora ==

Although redwoods dominate the landscape, many other plant species are common in Big Basin. One will certainly see coast Douglas-fir, tan oak, Pacific madrone, and Pacific wax myrtle trees in the park. Competing for sunshine are also many shrubs such as red huckleberries, western azalea, and many varieties of ferns. Spring and summer bring the wildflowers: redwood sorrel, salal, redwood violets, trillium, star lily and mountain iris. The rains of fall and winter deliver hundreds of kinds of fungi in a startling variety of shapes, sizes and colors.

Upon climbing to higher elevations, one will find the forest growing thinner, as redwoods are replaced by more drought-tolerant species. The higher, drier ridges and slopes of Big Basin are typically full of chaparral vegetation: knobcone pines, chinquapin and buckeye create the canopy, with ceanothus, manzanita, chamise, and chaparral pea growing dense and low. Adding a splash of color are wildflowers such as Indian paintbrush, monkey flower, bush poppies and yerba santa.

Near the mouth of Waddell Creek is the Theodore J. Hoover Natural Preserve, a rare relatively undisturbed freshwater marsh. This special place provides habitat for a wide variety of birds, reptiles and amphibians. The nearby Rancho Del Oso Nature and History Center interprets the cultural and natural history of the area.

==Fauna==

Mammals such as black-tailed deer, western gray squirrels, chipmunks and raccoons are common, but foxes, coyotes, bobcats, and opossums are also present. Cougars are known to live in the park but are rarely sighted. Grizzly bears are extinct in California, but were numerous in the past. The last known human to die in California due to a grizzly attack in the wild occurred in Big Basin when, in 1875, William Waddell, a lumber mill owner, was killed near Waddell Creek.

Bird life is abundant throughout the park. Steller&#x27;s jays and acorn woodpeckers are both seen and heard, and the dark-eyed junco is widespread. Less obvious are the brown creeper, Anna&#x27;s hummingbird, northern flicker, olive-sided flycatcher and sharp-shinned hawk. The first marbled murrelet nest ever sighted was located in Big Basin not far from the park headquarters. These robin-sized seabirds nest high in the oldest coast Douglas-firs and redwoods to feed their young. They can be seen or heard at dawn and dusk, high above the forest canopy.

Many reptiles are also present, but aside from the ubiquitous Coast Range subspecies of the western fence lizard (&quot;Sceloporus occidentalis bocourtii&quot;), most are rarely seen due to their shy behavior. The only dangerous reptile in the park is the Pacific rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus oreganus&quot;), found almost exclusively in the high, dry chaparral.

The damp, shady woodland floor is home to a variety of amphibians. Commonly seen species include the California newt (&quot;Taricha torosa torosa&quot;), Pacific tree frog (&quot;Pseudacris regilla&quot;), and arboreal salamander (&quot;Aneides lugubris&quot;). Less commonly seen are the black salamander (&quot;Aneides flavipunctatus&quot;) and California giant salamander (&quot;Dicamptodon ensatus&quot;) and the threatened California red-legged frog (&quot;Rana draytonii&quot;). Particularly intriguing are banana slugs (&quot;Ariolimax&quot; spp.), which can reach 6 inches long.

The butterfly, California sisters (&quot;Adelpha bredowii&quot;), flutter high in the tree canopies.

== Camping ==
Big Basin Redwoods State Park previously had many options for camping, including cabins, developed campsites, and trail camps. Within the park, there were 146 individual campsites, 36 cabins, and five trail camps. The 2020 CZU Lightning Complex fires destroyed many campgrounds; as of Summer 2024, none have re-opened.

Each campground at Big Basin Redwoods State Park was open on a different schedule during the year. The Huckleberry and Sequoia Campgrounds were open year round while Blooms Creek, Sempervirens, Watashi and Sky Meadow Campgrounds were seasonal.

== Access ==
The park is about two hours south of San Francisco, or seven hours north of Los Angeles.

Big Basin can be approached from the east, through redwood forest and coastal mountains, or from the coast, along State Route 1. The eastern route, over State Route 9 through Saratoga and smaller towns like Boulder Creek is more popular because of the famous trees. This route passes Castle Rock State Park (California) on the eastern side of the Santa Cruz range.

From SR 1, Gazos Creek road offers a pleasant fire-road route for mountain bikes (road closed to motor vehicles), which can then descend into the headquarters area or turn off on Johansen fire road to join China Grade above its intersection with State Route 236.

After reopening the park after the CZU Lightning Complex fires, the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District expanded its bus route 35 service to run four trips to and from the park on weekends only.

== In popular culture ==
Big Basin plays the part of the fictional &quot;Bolderoc National Park&quot; in the 1942 George Marshall film, &quot;The Forest Rangers.&quot; It also stands in for Muir Woods in the 1958 Alfred Hitchcock film, &quot;Vertigo&quot; and for Redwood National Park in the 1967 Disney film, &quot;The Gnome-Mobile&quot;.

<doc id="607415" wikidata="Q3522486" url="?curid=607415" title="The Restaurant (American TV series)">
<text>The Restaurant is a reality television series that aired on NBC in 2003 on Sundays, with a second season broadcasting in 2004. The series had encore presentations on CNBC and Bravo.

Celebrity chef Rocco DiSpirito opened the Gramercy Park, New York City, restaurant Union Pacific in August 1997. The NBC series, it was announced, would follow DiSpirito as he launched and operated a new Manhattan Italian American restaurant. The first season revolved around the construction and opening of Rocco&#x27;s on 22nd in the Flatiron District scheduled to open in five weeks. Some 7.5 million viewers tuned in for the July 20, 2003, premiere focusing on the search for a location and construction work for the new restaurant.

Among the 2000 people who showed up hoping to be hired were various actors, models and show business hopefuls. In addition to Rocco&#x27;s mother, Nicolina DiSpirito, known for her famous meatballs, the show&#x27;s on-camera personnel included David Miller (Sous-chef), Alex Corrado (Maitre d&#x27;), Mariani Ebert (Hostess), Domiziano Arcangeli (Himself), Heather Kristin (Waitress), Natalie Norman (Waitress), Topher Goodman (Waiter), Lisa Wurzel (Herself), Gideon Horowitz (Waiter), Heather Snell (Bartender), Amanda Congdon (Coat-check attendant), Pete Giovine (Waiter), Uzay Tumer (Captain), Emily Shaw (Captain), Lonn Coward (Waiter), Carrie Keranen (Waitress), Colleen Fitzgerald (Captain), Caroline Matler (Waitress), Brian Petruzzell (Busboy), Lola Belle (Bartender), Susanna Hari (Kitchen staff), Brian Allen (Waiter), Tony Acinapura (Chef), Massimiliano Bartoli (Chef), John Charlesworth (Kitchen staff), Laurent Saillard (General manager), Perry Pollaci (Kitchen staff), Matt DiBarro (Bartender).

Only 6.5 million viewers tuned in for the second season premiere, despite launching a week after the finale of the hit first season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. The second season, filmed six months after the restaurant&#x27;s opening, showed an ongoing power conflict between part owner Rocco DiSpirito and financier Jeffrey Chodorow, stemming from the restaurant&#x27;s lack of profitability despite its popularity.

On July 27, 2004, New York Supreme Court Judge Ira Gammerman issued an injunction barring Rocco DiSpirito from Rocco&#x27;s on 22nd street and gave Jeffrey Chodorow permission to sell or reopen the restaurant under a new theme. Chodorow and DiSpirito were ordered to return to court on August 31 to determine if there was an agreement between the parties and if DiSpirito violated the agreement. After that ruling DiSpirito attempted to file a $6 million countersuit charging that Chodorow made accounting irregularities and that DiSpirito was owed $175,000 in unpaid salary, and DiSpirito sought to regain fifty percent ownership of the restaurant. Chodorow initially invested $4 million in the restaurant and claims to have lost an additional $700,000.

After the restaurant closed its doors on September 15, 2004, it reopened in 2005 as a Brazilian steakhouse called Caviar &amp; Banana. Chodorow&#x27;s partner in the Brazilian restaurant was chef Claude Troisgros of Roanne, France, renowned for his namesake restaurant in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Caviar &amp; Banana has since closed, along with the subsequent Borough Food &amp; Drink restaurant and Almond, a French bistro opened by Jason Weiner and Eric Lemonides, the men behind Almond and Almoncello in the Hamptons.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Metro Weekly&quot; said &quot;Countless viewers will love The Restaurant, and they should. It’s a good show. But after years of dining on the usual fare of tired reality, sometimes you just want to be blown away. Alas, the wait continues.&quot;

&quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; wrote &quot;Confession time: I&#x27;m addicted to NBC&#x27;s semi-reality, semi-documentary series, &quot;The Restaurant.&quot; It&#x27;s partly because of its energy, partly because it feels like a night out, but mostly because it is spellbinding to watch a man unravel right in front of us.&quot;

&quot;New York Post&quot; writer Linda Stasi, who was mistaken for a &quot;New York Post&quot; food critic on the show, wrote &quot;I’m here to report that “reality TV” is about as real as David Gest‘s face. It’s life, as edited. Too bad that feature isn’t available in real life. Then there’s the fact that I’m not the food critic as implied in the promos – not that I would shy away from giving my opinion about something I know basically nothing about. High-stakes high jinks, methinks.&quot;

<text>Jean Vanier (, September 10, 1928 – May 7, 2019) was a Canadian Catholic philosopher and theologian. In 1964, he founded L&#x27;Arche, an international federation of communities spread over 37 countries for people with developmental disabilities and those who assist them. In 1971, he co-founded Faith and Light with Marie-Hélène Mathieu, which also works for people with developmental disabilities, their families, and friends in over 80 countries. He continued to live as a member of the original L&#x27;Arche community in Trosly-Breuil, France, until his death.

Over the years he wrote 30 books on religion, disability, normality, success, and tolerance. Among the honours he received were the Companion of the Order of Canada (1986), Grand Officer of the National Order of Quebec (1992), French Legion of Honour (2003), Community of Christ International Peace Award (2003, later revoked), the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award (2013), and the Templeton Prize (2015).

In February 2020, an internal report published by L&#x27;Arche concluded that Vanier sexually abused six women in Trosly-Breuil, France, between 1970 and 2005. The investigation was conducted by the UK-based GCPS Consulting Group.

== Early years and background ==
Vanier was the son of Canadian parents, Major-General Georges Vanier, who became the 19th Governor General of Canada (1959–1967), and his mother Pauline Vanier (née Archer). He was born in Geneva, and was the fourth of five siblings (including sister and brother Bernard Vanier), in his youth Vanier received a broad education in English and French, first in Canada and then in France and England. During World War II, Vanier and his family fled Paris just before the Nazi occupation. He spent much of the war at an English naval academy. From age 13, he trained for a career as a naval officer at the Dartmouth Naval College (later renamed Britannia Royal Naval College).

In early 1945, Vanier was visiting Paris, where his father was Canadian ambassador; he and his mother went to assist survivors of Nazi concentration camps. Seeing the emaciated victims was a profoundly moving encounter for him, which he never forgot. He served in World War II with the Royal Navy and then with the Royal Canadian Navy. In 1947, as a midshipman, Vanier accompanied the Royal Family on their tour of South Africa aboard HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot;.

In 1949, he joined the Royal Canadian Navy, at the carrier HMCS &quot;Magnificent&quot;. In 1950, he resigned his naval commission. Vanier travelled to Paris to study as an undergraduate. He eventually went on to complete a PhD in philosophy from the Institut Catholique de Paris, with a doctoral thesis on Aristotle which was published in 1966 as &quot;Happiness as Principle and End of Aristotelian Ethics&quot;; this was his first published work. He went on to write over 30 books during his career and taught philosophy at the University of St. Michael&#x27;s College, University of Toronto. He left academia in 1964, seeking a more spiritual ministry. His research lives on at the Jean Vanier Research Centre located at King&#x27;s University College in London, Ontario, Canada.

== Foundation of L&#x27;Arche ==

In 1964, through Vanier&#x27;s friendship with a priest named Thomas Philippe, he became aware of the plight of thousands of people institutionalized with developmental disabilities. Vanier invited two men, Raphael Simi and Philippe Seux, to leave the institutions where they resided and live with him in Trosly-Breuil, France. Their time together led to the establishment of L&#x27;Arche at Trosly-Breuil, a community where people with disabilities live with those who care for them. Since that time a network of 150 L&#x27;Arche communities have been established in 38 countries. A governing philosophy of the communities is Vanier&#x27;s belief that people with disabilities are teachers, rather than burdens bestowed upon families.

Until the late 1990s, Vanier carried the responsibility for L&#x27;Arche in Trosly-Breuil in France, and for the International Federation of L&#x27;Arche. He then stepped down to spend more time counselling, encouraging, and accompanying the people who come to live in L&#x27;Arche as assistants to those with disabilities. Vanier established 147 L&#x27;Arche communities in 37 countries around the world which have become places of pilgrimage for those involved.

== Later life ==

In 1968, Vanier gave a Faith and Sharing retreat in Mary Lake, Ontario, the first in his movement of retreats where people from many walks of life are welcome. The retreats continue today as part of the Faith and Sharing Federation.

As of 2013, there were 13 communities in North America that organize annual retreats and days of prayer. Faith and Sharing member Bill Clark, SJ, explains: &quot;There is then a two-fold movement in Faith and Sharing: an inward movement towards God hidden in the depths of our own vulnerability, and an outward movement towards our brothers and sisters, especially those who are more poor and in need.&quot;

In 1971, Vanier co-founded Faith and Light with Marie-Hélène Mathieu. This is an international movement of forums for people with developmental disabilities, their family and friends. Today there are over 1,500 Faith and Light communities in 81 countries around the world.

Vanier continued to live in the original L&#x27;Arche community of Trosly-Breuil, France, until his death in 2019. He continued to travel widely, visiting other L&#x27;Arche communities, encouraging projects for new communities and giving lectures and retreats. He was the 1998 Massey lecturer, focusing on the theme of &quot;Becoming Human&quot;. During one of his lectures, he touched on his distaste for barriers around people with intellectual disabilities, a motivating philosophy behind L&#x27;Arche: &quot;We must do what we can to diminish walls, to meet each other. Why do we put people with disabilities behind walls?&quot;

In 2017, Vanier narrated and appeared in the documentary &quot;Summer In The Forest&quot;, filmed in the L&#x27;Arche communities in Trosly-Breuil and Bethlehem and featuring many of the residents of both communities with whom he worked. Writing in the New York Times, critic Ken Jaworowski observed that &quot;just watching the residents leads you to confront and change many of your own preconceptions.&quot;

Vanier died on May 7, 2019. A week before his death, Pope Francis called Vanier to thank him for his years of ministry and service. Following his death, Pope Francis, who was flying back to Rome from North Macedonia, told a group of journalists, &quot;I want to express my gratitude for his testimony&quot; and said Vanier could read and interpret not only the Christian gaze on &quot;the mystery of death, of the cross, of suffering&quot;, but also &quot;the mystery of those who are discarded by the world&quot;.

Among those he influenced were the Dutch Catholic priest, professor, writer and theologian Henri Nouwen who came to join the L&#x27;Arche Daybreak community in Richmond Hill, Ontario.

==Sexual abuse==
In February 2020, an internal report by L&#x27;Arche concluded that Vanier sexually abused six women in Trosly-Breuil, France, between 1970 and 2005.

According to a joint statement by leaders of L&#x27;Arche International, Vanier had engaged in &quot;manipulative and emotionally abusive&quot; sexual relationships with six women without disabilities in France, between 1970 and 2005. Sexual relations were instigated by Vanier, usually in the context of giving spiritual guidance. The statement read, &quot;These women reported similar facts associated with highly unusual spiritual or mystical explanations used to justify these behaviours... The relationships ... had a significant negative impact on their personal lives and subsequent relationships. These actions are indicative of a deep psychological and spiritual hold Jean Vanier had on these women.&quot; It also said that Vanier asked the women to keep the incidents secret. The women included assistants and nuns. Vanier was also a member of a small clandestine group which subscribed to and participated in some of the sexual practices of disgraced priest Thomas Philippe, the L&#x27;Arche statement said.

A fuller report by an independent group commissioned by L&#x27;Arche, published in January 2023, learned of 25 different women who had experienced a sexual act or intimate gesture (such as kissing on the mouth or caresses to the body, most commonly the breasts) with Jean Vanier. These relationships in total span from 1952 to 2019. Vanier would typically initiate contact through meetings nominally about spiritual accompaniment; after some time, body contact and nudity would gradually be introduced into the spiritual accompaniment sessions. The most common pattern described is one where Vanier would kneel down in front of the woman with his head against her chest and then make contact with her breasts, and, if permitted, would caress the breasts with his mouth. Some of the women only came to regard these moments of contact as abusive many years later. Vanier would often quote from the Song of Songs.
The practices were founded on so-called &quot;mystical&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; beliefs that had been condemned by the Catholic Church, it added. Vanier described Philippe, who died in 1993, as his &quot;spiritual father&quot;, but at first publicly denied knowledge of the practices. The investigation was carried out by independent UK consultancy GCPS.

Vanier wrote in May 2015 that he now accepted that Philippe &quot;hurt mature and intelligent people who appear to have placed all their trust in him&quot; and that &quot;I am unable to peacefully reconcile these two realities.&quot;

===Reactions===
Cardinal Thomas Collins of the Archdiocese of Toronto described the events &quot;tragic and heart wrenching&quot;. The Canadian and American branches of L&#x27;Arche have voiced their concern in various statements.

In Canada, where there were many schools named after Vanier, some school boards have renamed schools named for him.

In February 2020, the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, posthumously stripped Vanier of two awards which the university had awarded him, including the 1994 Notre Dame Award for humanitarian service.

== Awards and honours ==
Vanier received numerous awards for his work, including the Companion of the Order of Canada, Officer of the Order of the Legion of Honour (France, 2003) and many awards from faith groups, among them the Paul VI International Prize, the Community of Christ International Peace Award (later revoked), the Rabbi Gunther Plaut Humanitarian Award, and the Gaudium et Spes Award, named after the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot; document.

In 1993, he received the Loyola Medal from Concordia University. In 1999, he won the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada&#x27;s Gordon Montador Award for &quot;Becoming Human&quot;.

In November 2004, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation poll ranked him as number 12 in a list of greatest Canadians.

In 2010, the asteroid 8604 was officially named Vanier in his honour.

In 2013, he received the United States–based Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award, established by the Diocese of Davenport, Iowa.

In March 2015, Vanier was awarded the $1.7 million Templeton Prize in recognition of his advocacy for people with disabilities and his contributions to a broader exploration of helping the weak and vulnerable.

On September 27, 2016, Vanier received the Peace Abbey Foundation (USA) International Courage of Conscience Award in Trosly-Breuil, France, for his lifelong commitment to building a world of inclusion for individuals with disabilities.

<doc id="607433" wikidata="Q7721132" url="?curid=607433" title="The Canadian Conspiracy">
<text>The Canadian Conspiracy is a 1986 CBC Television mockumentary, directed by Robert Boyd and co-written by Boyd, Mark Achbar and Mike Short. It parodies American Cold War propaganda films and tabloid journalism, using archival clips and interviews with notable Canadian entertainers to build a narrative that the Canadian government has for decades been training agents to infiltrate and take over the American entertainment industry for the purpose of subverting American culture in preparation for a Canadian invasion of the United States.

The film stars numerous celebrities as fictionalized versions of themselves, including Eugene Levy, Lorne Greene, Leslie Nielsen, William Shatner, Margot Kidder, Dave Thomas, John Candy, Anne Murray and Tommy Chong. It won two Gemini Awards and was nominated for an International Emmy Award.

==Synopsis==

Title cards indicate that an American News Network (ANN) special is being broadcast in its entirety by CBC Television due to the severity of its accusations. News anchor Edwin Newman states that the unprecedented report is the result of two years of investigations, and advises viewer discretion due to its shocking nature.

ANN camera crews surveil, ambush and chase their suspects, encountering an &quot;impenetrable wall of silence&quot;. Then, shortly before the broadcast, actor Eugene Levy turned informer and exposed the Canadian government plot to conquer America.

Archival film clips show Canadian pioneers in early Hollywood as influential figures; what kept them from totally blending in was their &quot;fanatical sense of national identity&quot;, including an intolerance for jokes about the climate of Canada. During a 1948 state visit, Harry Truman told William Lyon Mackenzie King the joke about &quot;a Canadian ice fisherman who caught forty pounds of ice.&quot; King was infuriated and swore to avenge this insult by recalling all the Canadians working in Hollywood. Mary Pickford met with King in September 1948, but he was unable to convince her or other Canadians to abandon their American careers. As a result, King resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Louis St. Laurent.

St. Laurent devised a new plan: to recruit the country&#x27;s best people, train them, and send them to infiltrate the new US television industry. To lead the program they selected Lorne Greene, known as the &quot;voice of doom&quot;, then a news announcer with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). They named the training centre the Lorne Greene School of Broadcasting (LGSOB) and it had many notable graduates before it was destroyed under suspicious circumstances, concealing its top-secret activities.

The LGSOB was immediately replaced by CBC Television, created in 1952 as the command post of the conspiracy. Soundproofed studios were used to brainwash agents, ensuring their unwavering loyalty, while it was an accepted fact that the best talent would move to the US. Monty Hall developed the game show format to erode American values. Rich Little learned impersonations and satire, used to mock US presidents. Science fiction was pioneered by James Doohan, who along with William Shatner operated &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which transforms its viewers into a cult-like following. With these widespread operations, Lorne Greene headed the west coast wing of the conspiracy, monitoring the many agents while he starred in &quot;Bonanza&quot;.
In 1963, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson adds a dedicated comedy-training program to the conspiracy, headed by comedy duo Johnny Wayne and Frank Shuster, who had &quot;infiltrated&quot; &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; a record 67 times. Public universities served as fronts for Wayne and Shuster schools across Canada, which created a &quot;potent strike force of comedians&quot;. The American perception of humour is grievously affected, and by the late 1960s protests and civil disobedience is rampant.

In 1968, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau became incensed when the Canadian-controlled show &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; was cancelled due to a monologue by operative David Steinberg. Trudeau has the show replaced by &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, another production overseen by Canadians.

The narrator suggests that Lorne Greene is connected to green cards, required by the growing number of Canadians working in the US, and that he is also connected to Lorne Michaels. After marrying Frank Shuster&#x27;s daughter, Michaels was ordered on Operation Manhattan as producer of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, a haven for Canadians. In 1982, Michaels assigned Paul Shaffer to &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. By the mid-1980s, four of the top five Hollywood comedy films were controlled by the conspiracy. LGSOB alumnus Leslie Nielsen is revealed to be the brother of Erik Nielsen, Canada&#x27;s then-current deputy prime minister and minister of defence.

The conspiracy also produced an increasing number of music records for American listeners. Anne Murray&#x27;s song &quot;Snowbird&quot; is shown to contain the backmasked message: &quot;The Canadians are coming. The Canadians are coming. Surrender peacefully and you will not be harmed.&quot; Another operation of the conspiracy is the board game &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, which disrupts American leisure time.

US security forces say that they are unable to stop the conspiracy, as Canadians are indistinguishable from Americans. Examining why the major US networks have not reported on the conspiracy, it is noted that both Peter Jennings, head anchor of ABC News, and Morley Safer, co-host of CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, are Canadians, implying a cover-up.

Reviewing the conspiracy plot, the narrator predicts horrific effects if nothing is done and Americans are made into Canadians, showing street crowds emulating Bob and Doug McKenzie. In Los Angeles, Levy is exhausted and hopes to put the conspiracy behind him.

==Cast==
In roles:
As fictionalized versions of themselves:
There are also a dozen brief man-on-the-street interviews conducted in Canada and the US.

==Production==
The film was produced by Bill House and Barbara Tranter of Toronto-based Shtick Productions, for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation with financial assistance from Telefilm Canada. It was made under the working title &quot;The Big Shtick: A Canadian Conspiracy&quot;.

The film was directed by Robert Boyd and co-written by Boyd, Mark Achbar and Mike Short. Original music was composed and recorded by Marc Jordan and John Capek. It was edited by Dave Goard with a running time of 90 minutes.

The celebrities who feature in the mockumentary&#x27;s interviews were each paid an honorarium of US$500. Archival film clips were provided by the CBC, the Public Archives of Canada, the National Film Board of Canada (NFB), Bellevue Pathé Quebec, and various film and television production companies.

==Themes and analysis==
Cultural researcher Jody Berland writes that the film shows its creators&#x27; amusement and frustration at their invisible outsider status in the United States. In the film, the United States is cast as a xenophobic imperial culture which fails to appreciate the differences of others, seeing less powerful nations as &quot;either dangerous enemies [or] less successful versions of themselves.&quot; The Canadians who can pass seamlessly as Americans are presented through a sensational, paranoid filter as dangerous to American culture and politics. This ironic and satirical take is understood by domestic audiences who know that Canada has an insignificant influence upon the American cultural monolith. The satire is also taken to be a fantasy of reverse colonization through the Canadian &quot;star system in exile&quot;.

Stereotypes of Canada and Canadians are heavily played upon for humour, particularly the stereotype of Canadians as good and kind neighbours which is satirized in the film&#x27;s sinister plot. Another frequently referenced stereotype is the climate of Canada. Early in the film, the saying &quot;Canada has only two seasons: winter and July&quot; is established as an offensive joke, but is reinforced as a &quot;true&quot; statement when a camera crew ventures outside in Canada during the &quot;brief summer thaw in July&quot;, through a sequence describing the difficulty constructing on permafrost, and through archival film clips which juxtapose mild weather in US cities with Toronto during a blizzard and which portray Canadians crossing the US border on showshoes and sledding and ice-fishing during May.

Colin Tait re-examined &quot;The Canadian Conspiracy&quot; in 2010 in the context of multinational labour currents in media studies journal &quot;Flow&quot;. He noted that American TV shows generally have a Canadian in their principal casts, representing a &quot;brain drain&quot; of top talent from Canada, though this has become balanced somewhat by an increasing number of US shows which moved production to the &quot;Hollywood North&quot; of Canada. Of these, Tait found &quot;Conspiracy&quot;″s theme adapted in Vancouver-shot &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, in which human-like robots infiltrate and dominate a human population – with Canadians actors playing six of the nine robot models.

==Release==
The film premiered on CBC Television on 8 June 1986. It was rebroadcast by CBC on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1986.

HBO-Cinemax acquired first broadcast rights in the United States.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Mike Boone of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; wrote that the film was a clever satire with an innovative presentation; he praised the editing and research, and compared it to the Woody Allen mockumentaries &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot; and &quot;Zelig&quot;. He found parts of it very funny but felt that the humour became uneven in the last half-hour. Michael Dorland came to a similar conclusion in a mixed review for &quot;Cinema Canada&quot;, appreciating the archival clips and editing but finding the humour, while at times brilliant, to become repetitive and overplayed.

Sid Adilman of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; strongly recommended it as &quot;wicked fare&quot;. He placed it on his list of the best television of the first half of 1986. Also writing for the &quot;Star&quot;, Terry Poulton called the film an ingenious parody of an expose which is &quot;as incontrovertible as it is preposterous.&quot;

In 2016, Jesse Walker of US magazine &quot;Reason&quot; recommended it as a &quot;tale of truly Canadian subversion&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===

The film won Best Entertainment Special and Best Direction in a Comedy/Variety/Entertainment/Performing Arts Program or Series at the 1986 Gemini Awards.

It was nominated for an International Emmy Award for Best Popular Arts Program.

<text>13 Going on 30 (released as Suddenly 30 in some countries) is a 2004 American fantasy romantic comedy film written by Cathy Yuspa and Josh Goldsmith, directed by Gary Winick, starring Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo, and produced by Susan Arnold and Donna Arkoff Roth. The film is about a 13-year-old girl in 1987 who awakens to find herself suddenly 30 years old and living in 2004 as a fashion editor.

&quot;13 Going on 30&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising Garner&#x27;s performance and its nostalgic environment. It was also praised for its humorous plot and self-empowering message. The film was also a commercial success, earning $22 million in its first week and becoming one of the year&#x27;s biggest-selling DVD rental titles. Its total box office was over $96 million. Additionally, the soundtrack charted inside the top 50 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Garner&#x27;s acting earned her nominations from both the MTV Movie Awards and the Teen Choice Awards.

==Plot==

In 1987, nerdy 13-year-old Jenna Rink yearns to be popular, so she persuades the Six Chicks, her school&#x27;s ruling clique led by Lucy &quot;Tom-Tom&quot; Wyman, to attend her 13th birthday party by doing their homework for them. Jenna&#x27;s best friend and next-door neighbor, Matty Flamhaff, secretly in love with her, gives her a dollhouse he made himself and sprinkles the roof with &quot;magic wishing dust.&quot; The Six Chicks arrive with a group of boys, including Jenna&#x27;s crush, Chris Grandy, and trick Jenna into believing he is going to play &quot;seven minutes in heaven&quot; with her while they leave with the completed homework. When Matty discovers what happened, a humiliated Jenna barricades herself and tearfully wishes to be &quot;30 and flirty and thriving&quot; as the wishing dust sprinkles on her.

The next morning, Jenna is shocked to find herself in a luxurious Fifth Avenue apartment as an adult in 2004, dating a young man she does not recognize and with no memory of the intervening 17 years. Upon further investigation, she learns that she now works as an editor for her favorite fashion magazine, &quot;Poise&quot;, alongside co-editor and best friend, Lucy, who is also grown up. However, the magazine is falling behind its arch-rival &quot;Sparkle&quot;, which her editor-in-chief, Richard Kneeland, believes is the work of a saboteur. A confused Jenna locates Matty, now a struggling photographer, in Greenwich Village in the hopes of learning what happened. She discovers that she has become the new head of the Six Chicks, that she stopped speaking to Matty, and that he is no longer her friend; she also learns that Lucy is Tom-Tom.

In her new adult life, Jenna spends time with and advises teenagers, and she saves a dull office party by leading the guests, including Matty, in an impromptu &quot;Thriller&quot; line dance. She also meets Matty&#x27;s fiancée, Wendy. However, Jenna gradually learns that her adult self had plagiarized ideas, became estranged from her parents, and cheated with a co-worker&#x27;s husband. Furthermore, she overhears Lucy plotting to remove her from her presentation on a rebranding for &quot;Poise&quot;. Jenna returns to her childhood home in New Jersey to reunite with her parents before reconciling with Matty and hiring him to help with her presentation. They gradually fall for each other throughout, even though Wendy is eager for Matty to move to Chicago.

Jenna&#x27;s presentation proves successful, but Lucy lies to Matty, claiming that Jenna did not use his photos but has him sign them over. While looking for Matty to deliver the good news, Jenna finds Wendy, who reveals that her wedding to him is the next day. Moreover, she learns from Kneeland that Lucy became &quot;Sparkle&quot;″s new editor-in-chief by using Jenna&#x27;s presentation. Outraged, she confronts Lucy, who scornfully reveals that Jenna sabotaged &quot;Poise&quot; in exchange for a position at &quot;Sparkle&quot;, though Lucy took the job first.

Jenna rushes to Matty&#x27;s childhood home, where the wedding is about to take place, to reveal what happened; Matty explains that he already knew of Lucy&#x27;s deception and has never trusted her since childhood. Jenna tries to convince Matty to give their relationship a chance, saying that she &quot;is not the awful person&quot; that she knows that she is. Matty acknowledges his feelings for her but responds that he cannot get back together with her now, because too many years have passed. Still caring about Jenna, Matty gives her the dollhouse, which he has kept despite their estrangement. Jenna despondently tells Matty that she loves him and that he&#x27;s her best friend; Matty responds by confessing that he has always loved her. Jenna leaves with the dollhouse; she goes next door and breaks down in tears while she looks closely at the dollhouse, as she realizes what she has lost when she lost Matty. She closes her tear-filled eyes as a breeze swirls some remnants of the wishing dust around her without her knowledge.

Opening her eyes, Jenna reawakens from the wishing dust to find herself back in 1987 on her 13th birthday, where no time has passed. When Matty finds her huddled alone in the closet, she happily embraces and kisses him. Realizing that Lucy is not a true friend, Jenna confronts her and destroys the homework she worked on for the Six Chicks. With this second chance, Jenna lives the subsequent 17 years differently, and she eventually goes on to become happily married to Matty. The newlywed couple then moves into a suburban house resembling the dollhouse Matty gave Jenna on her 13th birthday.

==Production==
In October 2002, director Gary Winick was in negotiations to direct &quot;13 Going on 30&quot;. It was also announced that Susan Arnold and Donna Arkoff Roth were producing the project with the writers&#x27; manager, Gina Matthews. Actress Jennifer Garner was cast for the movie&#x27;s lead role. In order to film the picture, Garner shot it while on break from filming her television series &quot;Alias&quot;. Gwyneth Paltrow, Hilary Swank, and Renée Zellweger were all considered for the lead role. Judy Greer was cast to play Lucy, Garner&#x27;s best friend; Kathy Baker and Phil Reeves were cast as Garner&#x27;s mother and father, respectively. Later, Andy Serkis was selected to play Garner&#x27;s boss; while Samuel Ball was announced as Garner&#x27;s boyfriend.

On May 13, 2003, it was reported that filming for the movie was underway in Los Angeles with Revolution Studios. It was filmed in Los Angeles, New York City and South Pasadena, California. Interior shots were filmed in Los Angeles. The crew moved to New York City, where they shot exteriors for 17 days. Principal photography took place from May to November 2003. Written by Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, the script was &quot;polished&quot; by Niels Mueller (who lost an initial writing credit in a subsequent dispute arbitrated by the Writers Guild of America).

Christa B. Allen, who portrayed 13-year-old Jenna, later &quot;reprised&quot; her role as a younger version of Jennifer Garner by portraying the teenage version of Jenny Perotti in &quot;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&quot;. In October 2016, it was announced &quot;13 Going on 30&quot; was going to be adapted for Broadway with an estimated debut in late 2017, but plans did not move forward.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;13 Going on 30&quot; has an approval rating of 65% based on reviews from 179 critics, with an average rating of 6.20/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Although the plot leaves a lot to be desired, &quot;13 Going on 30&quot; will tug at your inner teenager&#x27;s heartstrings thanks in large part to a dazzling performance from Jennifer Garner.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 57% based on reviews from 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A−, on a scale of A to F.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a highly positive review with a grade of &quot;A−&quot;, writing, &quot;&quot;13 Going on 30&quot; is the rare commercial comedy that leaves you entranced by what can happen only in the movies.&quot; Gleiberman also praised Garner&#x27;s performance, writing: &quot;She cuts out all traces of adult consciousness, of irony and flirtation and manipulation, reducing herself to a keen, goggle-eyed earnestness that&#x27;s utterly beguiling.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote: &quot;The possibilities of Jenna&#x27;s confusion are exploited for full comic effect. Garner, who turns out to be a charming, abandoned comedian, makes Jenna&#x27;s incredulousness and innocence very funny and occasionally even touching.&quot; Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; also praised her performance, writing &quot;Garner throws herself so fully and effectively into the role that in a few key scenes, she vividly conveys Jenna&#x27;s high spirits and giddy pleasure through the graceful curling of her toes.&quot; Leydon praised director Gary Winick for &quot;bringing a fresh spin to most of the script&#x27;s cliches and emphasizing nuggets of emotional truth provided by Goldsmith and Yuspa.&quot; Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that &quot;The film is tailor-made for women who openly lust for dream houses, dream jobs, and dream hubbies.&quot; He also wrote that &quot;the best stuff involves the childhood preamble. (The young actors playing Jenna, Matt, and Lucy are terrific.) Those moments feel painfully, comically true.&quot;

Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, commenting, &quot;This romantic comedy is intended as a cautionary fairy tale. The silly humor works with the film&#x27;s gentle message of self-empowerment and avoids sappiness in a tender interlude where the adult Jenna returns to her childhood home. Amusing, charming, and pleasantly nostalgic, &quot;13 Going on 30&quot; should fall easily onto moviegoers&#x27; wish lists.&quot; Mick Martin and Marsha Porter&#x27;s 2005 DVD and Video Guide called it a &quot;shameless rip-off of the Tom Hanks&#x27; classic &quot;Big&quot;&quot;, adding that it was &quot;weak, but predictable and is sparked by the excellent performance of Jennifer Garner&quot;.

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;The performances give the film more flavor and life than the situation does; it often feels like pre-chewed Bubble Yum. The message of the plot is that a lack of sophistication is the key to success, even in a fashion magazine that attracts readers through sexy exhibitionism. The movie would have shown some daring savvy if it had played more with the role-playing aspect of fashion spreads. Instead, it is content to eat its retro snack cake and have it, too.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 2 out of 4 and wrote: &quot;You buy the magic because it comes with the territory. What I couldn&#x27;t buy was the world of the magazine office, and the awkward scenes in which high-powered professionals don&#x27;t seem to notice that they&#x27;re dealing with a 13-year-old mind.&quot; Andrea Gronvall of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote that &quot;The formula works, thanks in large part to star Jennifer Garner, who&#x27;s so radiant theaters should be stocking sunblock. Underlying the shenanigans and the pop-psychology moral—self-love is a prerequisite for true love—there&#x27;s a touching wistfulness about roads not taken.&quot; Jorge Morales of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; commented: &quot;The thirty something in me was all, , but the kid in me was like, this film&#x27;s rad to the max.&quot; Nell Minow of Common Sense Media rated four stars out of five saying &quot;Touching, hilarious Jennifer Garner rom-com.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film received several nominations at the Teen Choice Awards, including a nomination for Garner. The musical performance of Garner and Ruffalo was nominated for an MTV Movie Award.

== Stage adaptation ==
On 28 September 2023, a UK stage adaptation of the movie was announced.

<text>A ramp strike or rampstrike is when an aircraft coming to land aboard an aircraft carrier impacts the rear of the carrier, also called the ramp, below the level of the flight deck.

Damage from a ramp strike to the aircraft can range from broken hook or undercarriage to total loss of airframe; damage to the carrier can range from injured deck plating to a severe fire.

One of the most famous non-fatal ramp strike accidents occurred on 23 June 1951 when Cdr. George Chamberlain Duncan attempted to land a Grumman F9F-2 Panther on USS &quot;Midway&quot; in BuNo &quot;125228&quot;, during carrier suitability tests in the Atlantic Ocean. The forward fuselage broke away and tumbled down the deck, which Duncan survived, suffering burns. Footage of this accident has been used in several films including &quot;Men of the Fighting Lady&quot;, &quot;Midway&quot;, and &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;.

<doc id="607447" wikidata="Q89917" url="?curid=607447" title="Walls of Constantinople">
<text>The Walls of Constantinople (; ) are a series of defensive stone walls that have surrounded and protected the city of Constantinople (today Istanbul in Turkey) since its founding as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great. With numerous additions and modifications during their history, they were the last great fortification system of antiquity, and one of the most complex and elaborate systems ever built. They were also the largest and strongest fortification in both the ancient and medieval world.

Initially built by Constantine the Great, the walls surrounded the new city on all sides, protecting it against attack from both sea and land. As the city grew, the famous double line of the Theodosian Walls was built in the 5th century. Although the other sections of the walls were less elaborate, they were, when well-manned, almost impregnable for any medieval besieger. They saved the city, and the Byzantine Empire with it, during sieges by the Avar–Sassanian coalition, Arabs, Rus&#x27;, and Bulgars, among others. The fortifications retained their usefulness after the advent of gunpowder siege cannons, which played a part in the city&#x27;s fall to Ottoman forces in 1453 but were not able to breach its walls.

The walls were largely maintained intact during most of the Ottoman period until sections began to be dismantled in the 19th century, as the city outgrew its medieval boundaries. Despite lack of maintenance, many parts of the walls survived and are still standing today. A large-scale restoration program has been underway since the 1980s.

==Land walls==
===Walls of Greek and Roman Byzantium===
According to tradition, the city was founded as Byzantium by Greek colonists from the Attic town of Megara, led by the eponymous Byzas, around 658 BC. The city then consisted of a small region around an acropolis located on the easternmost hill (corresponding to the modern site of the Topkapı Palace). According to the late Byzantine &quot;Patria of Constantinople&quot;, ancient Byzantium was enclosed by a small wall that began on the northern edge of the acropolis, extended west to the Tower of Eugenios, then went south and west towards the Strategion and the Baths of Achilles, continued south to the area known in Byzantine times as Chalkoprateia, and then turned, in the area of the Hagia Sophia, in a loop towards the northeast, crossed the regions known as Topoi and Arcadianae and reached the sea at the later quarter of Mangana. This wall was protected by twenty-seven towers and had at least two landward gates, one which survived to become known as the Arch of Urbicius, and one where the Milion monument was later located. On the seaward side, the wall was much lower. Although the author of the asserts that this wall dated to the time of Byzas, the French researcher Raymond Janin thinks it more likely that it reflects the situation after the city was rebuilt by the Spartan general Pausanias, who conquered the city in 479 BC. This wall is known to have been repaired, using tombstones, under the leadership of a certain Leo in 340 BC, against an attack by Philip II of Macedon.

Byzantium was relatively unimportant during the early Roman period. Contemporaries described it as wealthy, well peopled and well fortified, but that affluence came to an end because the city supported Pescennius Niger () in his war against Septimius Severus (). According to the account of Cassius Dio, the city held out against Severan forces for three years, until 196, with its inhabitants resorting even to throwing bronze statues at the besiegers when they ran out of other projectiles. Severus punished the city harshly: the strong walls were demolished, and the town was deprived of its civic status, being reduced to a mere village dependent on Heraclea Perinthus. However, appreciating the city&#x27;s strategic importance, Severus eventually rebuilt it and endowed it with many monuments, including a Hippodrome and the Baths of Zeuxippus, as well as a new set of walls, located some 300–400 m to the west of the old ones. Little is known of the Severan Wall save for a short description of its course by Zosimus and that its main gate was located at the end of a porticoed avenue (the first part of the later &quot;Mese&quot;) and shortly before the entrance of the later Forum of Constantine. The wall seems to have extended from near the modern Galata Bridge in the Eminönü quarter south through the vicinity of the Nuruosmaniye Mosque to curve around the southern wall of the Hippodrome, and then going northeast to meet the old walls near the Bosporus. The also mentions the existence of another wall during the siege of Byzantium by Constantine the Great during the latter&#x27;s conflict with Licinius, in 324. The text mentions that a fore-wall (&quot;proteichisma&quot;) ran near the Philadephion, located at about the middle of the later, Constantinian city, suggesting the expansion of the city beyond the Severan Wall by this time.

===Constantinian Walls===
Like Severus before him, Constantine began to punish the city for siding with his defeated rival, but he too soon realised the advantages of Byzantium&#x27;s location. From 324 to 336, the city was thoroughly rebuilt and inaugurated on 11 May 330 under the name of &quot;New Rome&quot; or &quot;Second Rome&quot;. Eventually, the city would most commonly be referred to as Constantinople, the &quot;City of Constantine&quot;, in dedication to its founder. New Rome was protected by a new wall about 2.8 km (15 &quot;stadia&quot;) west of the Severan wall. Constantine&#x27;s fortification consisted of a single wall, reinforced with towers at regular distances, which began to be constructed in 324 and was completed under his son Constantius II (r. 337–361). Only the approximate course of the wall is known: it began at the Church of St. Anthony at the Golden Horn, near the modern Atatürk Bridge, ran southwest and then southwards, passed east of the great open cisterns of Mocius and of Aspar, and ended near the Church of the Theotokos of the Rhabdos on the Propontis coast, somewhere between the later sea gates of St. Aemilianus and Psamathos.

Already by the early 5th century, Constantinople had expanded outside the Constantinian Wall in the extramural area known as the &quot;Exokionion&quot; or &quot;Exakionion&quot;. The wall survived during much of the Byzantine period, even though it was replaced by the Theodosian Walls as the city&#x27;s primary defense. An ambiguous passage refers to extensive damage to the city&#x27;s &quot;inner wall&quot; from an earthquake on 25 September 478, which likely refers to the Constantinian wall. When repairs were being undertaken, to prevent an invasion by Attila, the Blues and Greens, the supporters of chariot-racing teams, supplied 16,000 men between them for the building effort. 

Theophanes the Confessor reports renewed earthquake damage in 557. It appears that large parts survived relatively intact until the 9th century: the 11th-century historian Kedrenos records that the &quot;wall at Exokionion&quot;, likely a portion of the Constantinian wall, collapsed in an earthquake in 867. Only traces of the wall appear to have survived in later ages, although Alexander van Millingen states that some parts survived in the region of the until the early 19th century. In 2018 the construction of Yenikapı Transfer Center unearthed a section of the foundation of the wall of Constantine.

====Gates====
The names of a number of gates of the Constantinian Wall survive, but scholars debate their identity and exact location. 

The Old Golden Gate (, ), known also as the Xerolophos Gate and the Gate of Saturninus, is mentioned in the &quot;Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae&quot;, which further states that the city wall itself in the region around it was &quot;ornately decorated&quot;. The gate stood somewhere on the southern slopes of the Seventh Hill. Its construction is often attributed to Constantine, but is in fact of uncertain age. It survived until the 14th century, when the Byzantine scholar Manuel Chrysoloras described it as being built of &quot;wide marble blocks with a lofty opening&quot;, and crowned by a kind of stoa. In late Byzantine times, a painting of the Crucifixion was allegedly placed on the gate, leading to its later Ottoman name, &quot;İsakapı&quot; (&quot;Gate of Jesus&quot;). It was destroyed by an earthquake in 1509, but its approximate location is known through the presence of the nearby &quot;İsakapı Mescidi&quot; mosque.

The identity and location of the Gate of At[t]alos (, ) are unclear. Cyril Mango identifies it with the Old Golden Gate; van Millingen places it on the Seventh Hill, at a height probably corresponding to one of the later gates of the Theodosian Wall in that area; and Raymond Janin places it further north, across the Lycus and near the point where the river passed under the wall. In earlier centuries, it was decorated with many statues, including one of Constantine, which fell down in an earthquake in 740.

The only gate whose location is known with certainty, aside from the Old Golden Gate, is the Gate of Saint Aemilianus (, ), named in Turkish . It lay at the juncture with the sea walls, and served the communication with the coast. According to the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot;, the Church of St Mary of Rhabdos, where the Rod of Moses was kept, stood next to the gate.

The Old Gate of the Prodromos (, ), named after the nearby Church of St John the Baptist (called , &quot;the Forerunner&quot;, in Greek), is another unclear case. Van Millingen identifies it with the Old Golden Gate, while Janin considers it to have been located on the northern slope of the Seventh Hill.

The last known gate is the Gate of Melantias (, ), whose location is also debated. Van Millingen considered it to be a gate of the Theodosian Wall (the Pege Gate), while more recently, Janin and Mango have rebutted this, suggesting that it was located on the Constantinian Wall. While Mango identifies it with the Gate of the Prodromos, Janin considers the name to have been a corruption of the &quot;ta Meltiadou&quot; quarter, and places the gate to the west of the Mocius cistern. Other authors identified it with the Gate of Adrianople (A. M. Schneider) or with the Gate of Rhesios (A. J. Mordtmann).

===Theodosian Walls===

The double Theodosian Walls (, &quot;teichos Theodosiakon&quot;), located about to the west of the old Constantinian Wall, were erected during the reign of Emperor Theodosius II (), after whom they were named. The work was carried out in two phases, with the first phase erected during Theodosius&#x27; minority under the direction of Anthemius, the praetorian prefect of the East, and was finished in 413 according to a law in the &quot;Codex Theodosianus&quot;. An inscription discovered in 1993 however records that the work lasted for nine years, indicating that construction had already begun , in the reign of Emperor Arcadius. This initial construction consisted of a single curtain wall with towers, which now forms the inner circuit of the Theodosian Walls.

Both the Constantinian and the original Theodosian walls were severely damaged in two earthquakes, on 25 September 437 and 6 November 447. The latter was especially powerful and destroyed large parts of the wall, including 57 towers. Subsequent earthquakes, including another major one in January 448, compounded the damage. Theodosius II ordered the praetorian prefect Constantine to supervise the repairs, made all the more urgent as the city was threatened by the presence of Attila the Hun in the Balkans. Employing the city&#x27;s chariot-racing factions in the work, the walls were restored in a record 60 days, according to the Byzantine chroniclers and three inscriptions found &quot;in situ&quot;. It is at this date that the majority of scholars believe the second, outer wall to have been added, as well as a wide moat opened in front of the walls, but the validity of that interpretation is questionable; the outer wall was possibly an integral part of the original fortification concept.

Throughout their history, the walls were damaged by earthquakes and floods of the Lycus river. Repairs were undertaken on numerous occasions, as testified by the numerous inscriptions commemorating the emperors or their servants who undertook to restore them. The responsibility for these repairs rested on an official variously known as the Domestic of the Walls or the Count of the Walls (, &quot;Domestikos/Komēs tōn teicheōn&quot;), who employed the services of the city&#x27;s populace in this task. After the Latin conquest of 1204, the walls fell increasingly into disrepair, and the revived post-1261 Byzantine state lacked the resources to maintain them, except in times of direct threat.

====Course and topography====
In their present state, the Theodosian Walls stretch for about from south to north, from the &quot;Marble Tower&quot; (), also known as the &quot;Tower of Basil and Constantine&quot; (Greek: ) on the Propontis coast to the area of the Palace of the Porphyrogenitus () in the Blachernae quarter. The outer wall and the moat terminate even earlier, at the height of the Gate of Adrianople. The section between the Blachernae and the Golden Horn does not survive since the line of the walls was later brought forward to cover the suburb of Blachernae, and its original course is impossible to ascertain, as it lies buried beneath the modern city.

From the Sea of Marmara, the wall turns sharply to the northeast until it reaches the Golden Gate, at about 14 m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows a more or less straight line to the north, climbing the city&#x27;s Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68 m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35 m above sea level. Climbing the slope of the Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76 m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.

====Construction====

The Theodosian Walls consist of the main inner wall (, &quot;&quot;, &quot;great wall&quot;), separated from the lower outer wall (, or , , &quot;small wall&quot;) by a terrace, the (). Between the outer wall and the moat (, ) there stretched an outer terrace, the (), while a low breastwork crowned the moat&#x27;s eastern escarpment. Access to both terraces was possible through posterns on the sides of the walls&#x27; towers.

The inner wall is a solid structure, 4.5–6 m thick and 12 m high. It is faced with carefully cut limestone blocks, while its core is filled with mortar made of lime and crushed bricks. Between seven and eleven bands of brick, approximately 40 cm thick, traverse the structure, not only as a form of decoration, but also strengthening the cohesion of the structure by bonding the stone façade with the mortar core, and increasing endurance to earthquakes. The wall was strengthened with 96 towers, mainly square but also a few octagonal ones, three hexagonal and a single pentagonal one. They were 15–20 m tall and 10–12 m wide, and placed at irregular distances, according to the rise of the terrain: the intervals vary between 21 and 77 m, although most curtain wall sections measure between 40 and 60 meters. Each tower had a battlemented terrace on the top. Its interior was usually divided by a floor into two chambers, which did not communicate with each other. The lower chamber, which opened through the main wall to the city, was used for storage, while the upper one could be entered from the wall&#x27;s walkway, and had windows for view and for firing projectiles. Access to the wall was provided by large ramps along their side. The lower floor could also be accessed from the by small posterns. Generally speaking, most of the surviving towers of the main wall have been rebuilt in Byzantine or Ottoman times, and only the foundations of some are of original Theodosian construction. Furthermore, while until the Komnenian period, the reconstructions largely remained true to the original model, later modifications ignored the windows and embrasures on the upper story and focused on the tower terrace as the sole fighting platform.
The outer wall was 2 m thick at its base, and featured arched chambers on the level of the , crowned with a battlemented walkway, reaching a height of 8.5–9 m. Access to the outer wall from the city was provided either through the main gates or through small posterns on the base of the inner wall&#x27;s towers. The outer wall likewise had towers, situated approximately midway between the inner wall&#x27;s towers, and acting in supporting role to them. They are spaced at 48–78 m, with an average distance of 50–66 m. Of the outer wall&#x27;s towers, 62 survive. With few exceptions, they are square or crescent-shaped, 12–14 m tall and 4 m wide. They featured a room with windows on the level of the , crowned by a battlemented terrace, while their lower portions were either solid or featured small posterns, which allowed access to the outer terrace. The outer wall was a formidable defensive edifice in its own right: in the sieges of 1422 and 1453, the Byzantines and their allies, being too few to hold both lines of wall, concentrated on the defence of the outer wall.

The moat was situated at a distance of about 20 m from the outer wall. The moat itself was over 20 m wide and as much as 10 m deep, featuring a 1.5 m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top so as not to be used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city&#x27;s north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city&#x27;s sieges to suggest that the moat was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople.

The weakest section of the wall was the so-called &quot;Mesoteichion&quot; (, &quot;Middle Wall&quot;). Modern scholars are not in agreement over the extent of that portion of the wall, which has been variously defined from as narrowly as the stretch between the Gate of St. Romanus and the Fifth Military Gate (by A.M. Schneider) to as broad as from the Gate of Rhegion to the Fifth Military Gate (by B. Tsangadas) or from the Gate of St. Romanus to the Gate of Adrianople (by van Millingen).

The walls survived the entire Ottoman period and appeared in travelogues of foreign visitors to Constantinople/Istanbul. A 16th-century Chinese geographical treatise, for example, recorded, &quot;Its city has two walls. A sovereign prince lives in the city...&quot;.

====Gates====
The wall contained nine main gates, which pierced both the inner and the outer walls, and a number of smaller posterns. The exact identification of several gates is debatable for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence.

In the traditional nomenclature, established by Philipp Anton Dethier in 1873, the gates are distinguished into the &quot;Public Gates&quot; and the &quot;Military Gates&quot;, which alternated over the course of the walls. According to Dethier&#x27;s theory, the former were given names and were open to civilian traffic, leading across the moat on bridges, and the latter were known by numbers, were restricted to military use and led only to the outer sections of the walls. Today that division is, if retained at all, only a historiographical convention. There is sufficient reason to believe that several of the &quot;Military Gates&quot; were also used by civilian traffic. In addition, a number of them have proper names, and the established sequence of numbering them, based on their perceived correspondence with the names of certain city quarters lying between the Constantinian and Theodosian Walls, which have numerical origins, has been shown to be erroneous. For instance, the &quot;Deuteron&quot;, the &quot;Second&quot; Quarter, was located not in the southwest behind the Gate of the &quot;Deuteron&quot; or &quot;Second Military Gate&quot;, as would be expected, but in the northwestern part of the city.

=====First Military Gate=====
The gate is a small postern, which lies at the first tower of the land walls, at the junction with the sea wall. It features a wreathed &quot;Chi-Rhō&quot; Christogram above it. It is also known as the (&#x27;Gate of the Tannery&#x27;) in reference to the nearby leather works.

=====Golden Gate=====
Following the walls from south to north, the Golden Gate (, &quot;Chryseia Pylē&quot;; ; ), is the first gate to be encountered. It was the main ceremonial entrance into the capital, used especially for the occasions of a triumphal entry of an emperor into the capital on the occasion of military victories or other state occasions such as coronations. On rare occasions, as a mark of honor, the entry through the gate was allowed to non-imperial visitors: papal legates (in 519 and 868) and, in 710, to Pope Constantine. The Gate was used for triumphal entries until the Komnenian period; thereafter, the only such occasion was the entry of Michael VIII Palaiologos into the city on 15 August 1261, after its reconquest from the Latins. With the progressive decline in Byzantium&#x27;s military fortunes, the gates were walled up and reduced in size in the later Palaiologan period, and the complex converted into a citadel and refuge.

The Golden Gate was emulated elsewhere, with several cities naming their principal entrance thus, for instance Thessaloniki (also known as the Vardar Gate) or Antioch (the Gate of Daphne), as well as the Kievan Rus&#x27;, who built monumental &quot;Golden Gates&quot; at Kiev and Vladimir. The entrance to San Francisco Bay, California, was similarly named the Golden Gate in the mid-19th century, in a distant historical tribute to Byzantium.

The date of the Golden Gate&#x27;s construction is uncertain, with scholars divided between Theodosius I and Theodosius II. Earlier scholars favored the former, but the current majority view tends to the latter, meaning that the gate was constructed as an integral part of the Theodosian Walls. The debate has been carried over to a now-lost Latin inscription in metal letters that stood above the doors and commemorated their gilding in celebration of the defeat of an unnamed usurper:

(English translation) 
While the legend has not been reported by any known Byzantine author, an investigation of the surviving holes wherein the metal letters were riveted verified its accuracy. It also showed that the first line stood on the western face of the arch, while the second on the eastern. According to the current view, this refers to the usurper Joannes (r. 423–425), while according to the supporters of the traditional view, it indicates the gate&#x27;s construction as a free-standing triumphal arch in 388–391 to commemorate the defeat of the usurper Magnus Maximus (r. 383–388) and was only later incorporated into the Theodosian Walls.
The gate, built of large square blocks of polished white marble fitted together without cement, has the form of a triumphal arch with three arched gates, the middle one larger than the two others. The gate is flanked by large square towers, which form the 9th and 10th towers of the inner Theodosian wall. With the exception of the central portal, the gate remained open to everyday traffic. The structure was richly decorated with numerous statues, including a statue of Theodosius I on an elephant-drawn quadriga on top, echoing the &quot;Porta Triumphalis&quot; of Rome, which survived until it fell down in the 740 Constantinople earthquake. Other sculptures were a large cross, which fell in an earthquake in 561 or 562; a Victory, which was cast down in the reign of Michael III; and a crowned Fortune of the city. In 965, Nikephoros II Phokas installed the captured bronze city gates of Mopsuestia in the place of the original ones.
The main gate itself was covered by an outer wall, pierced by a single gate, which in later centuries was flanked by an ensemble of reused marble reliefs. According to descriptions of Pierre Gilles and English travelers from the 17th century, these reliefs were arranged in two tiers, and featured mythological scenes, including the Labours of Hercules. These reliefs, lost since the 17th century with the exception of some fragments now in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum, were probably put in place in the 9th or 10th centuries to form the appearance of a triumphal gate. According to other descriptions, the outer gate was also topped by a statue of Victory, holding a crown.

Despite its ceremonial role, the Golden Gate was one of the strongest positions along the walls of the city and withstood several attacks during the various sieges. With the addition of transverse walls on the &quot;peribolos&quot; between the inner and outer walls, it formed a virtually separate fortress. Its military value was recognized by John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347–1354), who records that it was virtually impregnable, capable of holding provisions for three years and defying the whole city if need be. He repaired the marble towers and garrisoned the fort, but had to surrender it to John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1391) when he abdicated in 1354. John V undid Kantakouzenos&#x27; repairs and left it unguarded, but in 1389–90 he too rebuilt and expanded the fortress, erecting two towers behind the gate and extending a wall some 350 m to the sea walls, thus forming a separate fortified enceinte inside the city to serve as a final refuge. In the event, John V was soon after forced to flee there from a coup led by his grandson, John VII. The fort held out successfully in the subsequent siege that lasted several months, and in which cannons were possibly employed. In 1391 John V was compelled to raze the fort by Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1389–1402), who otherwise threatened to blind his son Manuel, whom he held captive. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos attempted to rebuild it in 1434, but was thwarted by threats from Sultan Murad II.

According to one of the many Greek legends about the Constantinople&#x27;s fall to the Ottomans, when the Turks entered the city, an angel rescued the emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again to conquer the city back for Christians. The legend explained the later walling up of the gate as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy.

=====Yedikule Fortress=====
After his conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Sultan Mehmed II built a new fort in 1458. By adding three larger towers to the four pre-existing ones (towers 8 to 11) on the inner Theodosian wall, he formed the Fortress of the Seven Towers ( or &quot;Zindanları&quot;). It lost its function as a gate, and for much of the Ottoman era, it was used as a treasury, archive, and state prison. It eventually became a museum in 1895.

=====Xylokerkos Gate=====

The Xylokerkos or Xerokerkos Gate (), now known as the Belgrade Gate (&quot;Belgrat Kapısı&quot;), lies between towers 22 and 23. Alexander van Millingen identified it with the Second Military Gate, which is located further north. Its name derives from the fact that it led to a wooden &quot;circus&quot; (amphitheatre) outside the walls. The gate complex is approximately 12 m wide and almost 20 m high, while the gate itself spans 5 m.

According to a story related by Niketas Choniates, in 1189 the gate was walled off by Emperor Isaac II Angelos, because according to a prophecy, it was this gate that Western Emperor Frederick Barbarossa would enter the city through. It was re-opened in 1346, but closed again before the siege of 1453 and remained closed until 1886, leading to its early Ottoman name, &quot;Kapalı Kapı&quot; (&quot;Closed Gate&quot;).

=====Second Military Gate=====
The gate () is located between towers 30 and 31, little remains of the original gate, and the modern reconstruction may not be accurate.

=====Gate of the Spring=====

The Gate of the Spring or Pēgē Gate ( in Greek) was named after a popular monastery outside the Walls, the &quot;Zōodochos Pēgē&quot; (&quot;Life-giving Spring&quot;) in the modern suburb of Balıklı.
Its modern Turkish name, Gate of Selymbria (Tr. &quot;Silivri Kapısı&quot; or &quot;Silivrikapı&quot;, Gk. ), appeared in Byzantine sources shortly before 1453. It lies between the heptagonal towers 35 and 36, which were extensively rebuilt in later Byzantine times: its southern tower bears an inscription dated to 1439 commemorating repairs carried out under John VIII Palaiologos. The gate arch was replaced in the Ottoman period. In addition, in 1998 a subterranean basement with 4th/5th century reliefs and tombs was discovered underneath the gate.

Van Millingen identifies this gate with the early Byzantine Gate of Melantias (Πόρτα Μελαντιάδος), but more recent scholars have proposed the identification of the latter with one of the gates of the city&#x27;s original Constantinian Wall.

It was through this gate that the forces of the Empire of Nicaea, under General Alexios Strategopoulos, entered and retook the city from the Latins on 25 July 1261.

=====Third Military Gate=====
The Third Military Gate (), named after the quarter of the &quot;Triton&quot; (&quot;the Third&quot;) that lies behind it, is situated shortly after the Pege Gate, exactly before the C-shaped section of the walls known as the &quot;Sigma&quot;, between towers 39 and 40. It has no Turkish name, and is of middle or late Byzantine construction. The corresponding gate in the outer wall was preserved until the early 20th century, but has since disappeared. It is very likely that this gate is to be identified with the Gate of Kalagros ().

=====Gate of Rhegion=====
Modern &quot;Yeni Mevlevihane Kapısı&quot;, located between towers 50 and 51 is commonly referred to as the Gate of Rhegion () in early modern texts, allegedly named after the suburb of Rhegion (modern Küçükçekmece), or as the Gate of Rhousios () after the hippodrome faction of the Reds (, &quot;rhousioi&quot;) which was supposed to have taken part in its repair. From Byzantine texts it appears that the correct form is Gate of Rhesios (), named according to the 10th-century &quot;Suda&quot; lexicon after an ancient general of Greek Byzantium. A.M. Schneider also identifies it with the Gate of Myriandr[i]on or Polyandrion (&quot;Place of Many Men&quot;), possibly a reference to its proximity to a cemetery. It is the best-preserved of the gates, and retains substantially unaltered from its original, 5th-century appearance.

=====Fourth Military Gate=====
The so-called Fourth Military Gate stands between towers 59 and 60, and is currently walled up. Recently, it has been suggested that this gate is actually the Gate of St. Romanus, but the evidence is uncertain.

===== Gate of St. Romanus =====
The Gate of St. Romanus () was named so after a nearby church and lies between towers 65 and 66. It is known in Turkish as &quot;Topkapı&quot;, the &quot;Cannon Gate&quot;, after the great Ottoman cannon, the &quot;Basilic&quot;, that was placed opposite it during the 1453 siege. With a gatehouse of 26.5 m, it is the second-largest gate after the Golden Gate. According to conventional wisdom, it is here that Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Byzantine emperor, was killed on 29 May 1453.

=====Fifth Military Gate=====
The Fifth Military Gate () lies immediately to the north of the Lycus stream, between towers 77 and 78, and is named after the quarter of the &quot;Pempton&quot; (&quot;the Fifth&quot;) around the Lycus. It is heavily damaged, with extensive late Byzantine or Ottoman repairs evident. It is also identified with the Byzantine Gate of [the Church of] St. Kyriake, and called &quot;Sulukulekapı&quot; (&quot;Water-Tower Gate&quot;) or &quot;Hücum Kapısı&quot; (&quot;Assault Gate&quot;) in Turkish, because there the decisive breakthrough was achieved on the morning of 29 May 1453. In the late 19th century, it appears as the &quot;Örülü kapı&quot; (&quot;Walled Gate&quot;).

Some earlier scholars, like J. B. Bury and Kenneth Setton, identify this gate as the &quot;Gate of St. Romanus&quot; mentioned in the texts on the final siege and fall of the city. If this theory is correct, the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI, died in the vicinity of this gate during the final assault of 29 May 1453. Support to this theory comes from the fact that the particular gate is located at a far weaker section of the walls than the &quot;Cannon Gate&quot;, and the most desperate fighting naturally took place here.

=====Gate of Charisius=====
The Gate of Char[i]sius (), named after the nearby early Byzantine monastery founded by a &quot;vir illustris&quot; of that name, was, after the Golden Gate, the second-most important gate. In Turkish it is known as &quot;Edirnekapı&quot; (&quot;Adrianople Gate&quot;), and it is here where Mehmed II made his triumphal entry into the conquered city. This gate stands on top of the sixth hill, which was the highest point of the old city at 77 meters. It has also been suggested as one of the gates to be identified with the Gate of Polyandrion or Myriandrion (), because it led to a cemetery outside the Walls. The last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI, established his command here in 1453.

=====Minor gates and posterns=====
Known posterns are the , a small postern after the Yedikule Fort (between towers 11 and 12), and the gates between towers 30/31, already walled up in Byzantine times, and 42/43, just north of the &quot;Sigma&quot;. On the &quot;Yedikule Kapısı&quot;, opinions vary as to its origin: some scholars consider it to date already to Byzantine times, while others consider it an Ottoman addition.

=====Kerkoporta=====
According to the historian Doukas, on the morning of 29 May 1453, the small postern called &quot;Kerkoporta&quot; was left open by accident, allowing the first fifty or so Ottoman troops to enter the city. The Ottomans raised their banner atop the Inner Wall and opened fire on the Greek defenders of the &quot;peribolos&quot; below. This spread panic, beginning the rout of the defenders and leading to the fall of the city. In 1864, the remains of a postern located on the Outer Wall at the end of the Theodosian Walls, between tower 96 and the so-called Palace of the Porphyrogenitus, were discovered and identified with the Kerkoporta by the Greek scholar A.G. Paspates. Later historians, like van Millingen and Steven Runciman have accepted this theory as well. But excavations at the site have uncovered no evidence of a corresponding gate in the Inner Wall (now vanished) in that area, and it may be that Doukas&#x27; story is either invention or derived from an earlier legend concerning the Xylokerkos Gate, which several earlier scholars also equated with the &quot;Kerkoporta&quot;.

====Later history====

The Theodosian Walls have been called the &quot;most monumental and successful&quot; fortifications of late antiquity. According to &quot;The&quot; &quot;Cambridge Ancient History&quot;, they were &quot;perhaps the most successful and influential city walls ever built – they allowed the city and its emperors to survive and thrive for more than a millennium, against all strategic logic, on the edge of [an] extremely unstable and dangerous world...&quot;. They remained effective into the fifteenth century; during the 1422 siege of the city, Ottoman cannon fired on the part of the wall between the Golden Gate and the Gate of Romanos, but were unable to breach the walls.

During the final siege of the city in 1453, Ottoman artillery were unable to breach the wall for a period of almost two months. The city fell on 29 May after a total of seven weeks of siege: at this time, it was reckoned to have the strongest fortifications of any city in Europe. After the capture of the city, one of Mehmed&#x27;s first actions was to order the repair of the walls.

The wall was later damaged in the 1766 Istanbul earthquake.

===Walls of Blachernae===
The Walls of Blachernae connect the Theodosian Walls, which terminate at the height of the Palace of the Porphyrogenitus (), with the sea wall at the Golden Horn. They consist of a series of single walls built in different periods, which cover the suburb of Blachernae. Generally they are about 12–15 meters in height, thicker than the Theodosian Walls and with more closely spaced towers. Situated on a steep slope, they lacked a moat, except on their lower end towards the Golden Horn, where Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos had dug one.

The question of the original fortifications in this area has been examined by several scholars, and several theories have been proposed as to their course. It is known from the &quot;Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae&quot; that the XIV region, which comprised Blachernae, stood apart and was enclosed all around by a wall of its own. Further it is recorded that originally, and at least as late as the Avar-Persian siege of 626, when they were burned down, the important sanctuaries of Panagia Blachernitissa and St. Nicholas lay just outside the quarter&#x27;s fortifications. Traces of the quarter&#x27;s walls have been preserved, running from the area of the Porphyrogenitus Palace in straight line to the so-called Prison of Anemas. The original fortified quarter can thereby be roughly traced to have comprised the two northern spurs of the city&#x27;s Seventh Hill in a triangle, stretching from the Porphyrogenitus Palace to the Anemas Prison, from there to the church of St. Demetrios Kanabos and thence back to the Porphyrogenitus Palace. These fortifications were apparently older than the Theodosian Walls, probably dating to sometime in the 4th century, and were then connected to the new city walls under Theodosius II, with the western wall forming the outer face of the city&#x27;s defenses and the eastern wall fell into disrepair.

Today, the Theodosian Walls are connected in the vicinity of the Porphyrogenitus Palace with a short wall, which features a postern, probably the postern of the Porphyrogenitus () recorded by John VI Kantakouzenos, and extends from the palace to the first tower of the so-called Wall of Manuel Komnenos. As recorded by the historian Niketas Choniates, that wall was built by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos () as a protection to the imperial Palace of Blachernae, since the late 11th century the emperors&#x27; preferred residence. It is an architecturally excellent fortification, consisting of a series of arches closed on their outer face, built with masonry larger than usual and thicker than the Theodosian Walls, measuring some 5 m at the top. It features eight round and octagonal towers, while the last is square. The wall stretches for 220 m, beginning at an almost right angle from the line of the Theodosian Walls, going westward up to the third tower and then turning sharply north. The quality of the wall&#x27;s construction was shown in the final Ottoman siege, when repeated attacks, intensive bombardment (including the large bombard of Orban) and attempts at undermining it came to naught. The Komnenian wall lacks a moat, since the difficult terrain of the area makes it unnecessary. The wall features one postern, between the second and third towers, and one large gate, the (&quot;Crooked Gate&quot;), between the sixth and seventh towers. Its Turkish name comes from the sharp bend of the road in front of it to pass around a tomb which is supposed to belong to Hazret Hafiz, a companion of Muhammad who died there during the first Arab siege of the city. It is usually, but not conclusively, identified with the Byzantine Kaligaria Gate (, ), the &quot;Gate of the Bootmakers&#x27; Quarter&quot; ( Latin &quot;caliga&quot;, &quot;sandal&quot;).

From the last tower of the Wall of Manuel Komnenos to the so-called Prison of Anemas stretches another wall, some 150 m in length, with four square towers. It is probably of later date, and of markedly inferior quality than the Komnenian wall, being less thick and with smaller stones and brick tiles utilized in its construction. It also bears inscriptions commemorating repairs in 1188, 1317 and 1441. A walled-up postern after the second tower is commonly identified with the Gyrolimne Gate (, ), named after the &quot;Argyra Limnē&quot;, the &quot;Silver Lake&quot;, which stood at the head of the Golden Horn. It probably serviced the Blachernae Palace, as evidenced by its decoration with three imperial busts. Schneider however suggests that the name could refer rather to the &quot;Eğri Kapı&quot;.

Then comes the outer wall of the Anemas Prison, which connects to a double stretch of walls. The outer wall is known as the Wall of Leo, as it was constructed by Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820) in 813 to safeguard against the siege by the Bulgarian ruler Krum. This wall was then extended to the south by Michael II (r. 820–829). The wall is a relatively light structure, less than 3 m thick, buttressed by arches which support its parapet and featuring four towers and numerous loopholes. Behind the Leonine Wall lies an inner wall, which was renovated and strengthened by the additions of three particularly fine hexagonal towers by Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–842). The two walls stand some 26 m apart and are pierced by a gate each, together comprising the Gate of Blachernae (, &quot;porta tōn Blachernōn&quot;). The two walls form a fortified enclosure, called the or (&quot;bracelet&quot;) of Blachernae () by the Byzantines, and known after the Ottoman capture of the city in Greek as the (Πενταπύργιον, &quot;Five Towers&quot;), in allusion to the (Gk. ) fortress. The inner wall is traditionally identified by scholars like van Millingen and Janin with the Wall of Heraclius, built by Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641) after the Avar–Persian siege to enclose and protect the Church of the Blachernitissa. Schneider identified it in part with the &quot;Pteron&quot; (Πτερόν, &quot;wing&quot;), built at the time of Theodosius II to cover the northern flank of the Blachernae (hence its alternate designation as , &quot;outwork&quot;) from the Anemas Prison to the Golden Horn. Consequently, Schneider transferred the identity of the Heraclian Wall on the short stretch of sea wall directly attached to it to its east, which displays a distinct architecture. The identity of the &quot;Pteron&quot; remains an unresolved question among modern scholars.

Another, short wall was added in later times, probably in the reign of Theophilos, stretching from the junction of the land and sea walls to the sea itself, and pierced by the so-called Wooden Gate (, , or , ). Both this wall and the gate were demolished in 1868.

==Preservation and restoration work==
The land walls run through the heart of modern Istanbul, with a belt of parkland flanking their course. They are pierced at intervals by modern roads leading westwards out of the city. Many sections were restored during the 1980s, with financial support from UNESCO, but the restoration program has been criticized for destroying historical evidence, focusing on superficial restoration, the use of inappropriate materials and poor quality of work. This became apparent in the 1999 earthquakes, when the restored sections collapsed while the original structure underneath remained intact. The threat posed by urban pollution, and the lack of a comprehensive restoration effort, prompted the World Monuments Fund to include them on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world.

==Sea walls==

The seaward walls (, &quot;teichē paralia&quot;) enclosed the city on the sides of the Sea of Marmara (Propontis) and the gulf of the Golden Horn (). Although the original city of Byzantium certainly had sea walls, traces of which survive, the exact date for the construction of the medieval walls is a matter of debate. Traditionally, the seaward walls have been attributed by scholars to Constantine I, along with the construction of the main land wall. The first known reference to their construction comes in 439, when the urban prefect Cyrus of Panopolis (in sources often confused with the praetorian prefect Constantine) was ordered to repair the city walls and complete them on the seaward side. This activity is certainly not unconnected to the fact that in the same year, Carthage fell to the Vandals, an event which signaled the emergence of a naval threat in the Mediterranean. This two-phase construction remains the general consensus, but Cyril Mango doubts the existence of any seaward fortifications during Late Antiquity, as they are not specifically mentioned as extant by contemporary sources until much later, around the year 700.
The Sea Walls were architecturally similar to the Theodosian Walls, but of simpler construction. They were formed by a single wall, considerably lower than the land walls, with inner circuits in the locations of the harbours. Enemy access to the walls facing the Golden Horn was prevented by the presence of a heavy chain or boom, installed by Emperor Leo III (r. 717–741), supported by floating barrels and stretching across the mouth of the inlet. One end of this chain was fastened to the Tower of Eugenius, in the modern suburb of Sirkeci, and the other in Galata, to a large, square tower, the &quot;Kastellion&quot;, the basement of which was later turned into the Yeraltı (Underground) Mosque. At the same time, on the Marmara coast, the city&#x27;s defence was helped by strong currents, which made an attack by a fleet almost impossible. According to Geoffrey of Villehardouin, that was reason that the Fourth Crusade did not attack the city from that side.

During the early centuries of its existence, Constantinople faced few naval threats. Especially after the wars of Justinian, the Mediterranean had again become a &quot;Roman lake&quot;. It was during the first siege of the city by the Avars and the Sasanid Persians that for the first time, a naval engagement was fought off the city itself. After the Arab conquests of Syria and Egypt, a new naval threat emerged. In response, the sea walls were renovated in the early 8th century under Tiberios III (r. 698–705) or Anastasios II (r. 713–715). Michael II (r. 820–829) initiated a wide-scale reconstruction, eventually completed by his successor Theophilos (r. 829–842), which increased their height. As these repairs coincided with the capture of Crete by the Saracens, no expense was spared: As Constantine Manasses wrote, &quot;the gold coins of the realm were spent as freely as worthless pebbles&quot;. Theophilos&#x27; extensive work, essentially rebuilding the sea walls, is testified to by the numerous inscriptions found or otherwise recorded that bear his name, more than those of any other emperor. Despite future changes and restorations, those walls would essentially protect the city until the end of the empire.
During the siege of the city by the Fourth Crusade, the sea walls nonetheless proved to be a weak point in the city&#x27;s defences, as the Venetians managed to storm them. Following that experience, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) took particular care to heighten and strengthen the seaward walls immediately after the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261 since a Latin attempt to recover the city was regarded as imminent. Furthermore, the installation of the Genoese at Galata across the Golden Horn, agreed upon in the Treaty of Nymphaeum (1261), posed a further potential threat to the city. Time was short, as a Latin attempt to recover the city was expected, and the sea walls were heightened by the addition of 2 m high wooden and hide-covered screens. Ten years later, facing the threat of an invasion by Charles d&#x27;Anjou, a second line of walls was built behind the original maritime walls, although no trace of them survives today.

The walls were again restored under Andronikos II Palaiologos () and again under his successor Andronikos III Palaiologos, when, on 12 February 1332, a major storm caused breaches in the wall and forced the seaward gates open. In 1351, when the empire was at war with the Genoese, John VI Kantakouzenos again repaired the walls, and even opened a moat in front of the wall facing the Golden Horn. Other repairs are recorded in 1434, again to defend against the Genoese, and again in the years leading up to the final siege and fall of the city to the Ottomans, partly with funds provided by the Despot of Serbia, George Brankovic.

===Golden Horn Wall===
The wall facing towards the Golden Horn, where in later times most seaborne traffic was conducted, stretched for a total length of 5,600 metres from the cape of St. Demetrius to the Blachernae, where it adjoined the Land Walls. Although most of the wall was demolished in the 1870s, during the construction of the railway line, its course and the position of most gates and towers is known with accuracy. It was built further inland from the shore, and was about 10 metres tall. According to Cristoforo Buondelmonti it featured 14 gates and 110 towers, although 16 gates are known that are of Byzantine origin. The northern shore of the city was always its more cosmopolitan part: a major focal point of commerce, it also contained the quarters allocated to foreigners living in the imperial capital. Muslim traders had their own lodgings (&quot;mitaton&quot;) there, including a mosque, while from the time of Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) on, the emperors granted to the various Italian maritime republics extensive trading quarters which included their own wharfs (&quot;skalai&quot;) beyond the sea walls.

The known gates of the Golden Horn wall may be traced in order from the Blachernae eastwards to the Seraglio Point, as follows:

The first gate, very near the land walls, was the Koiliomene Gate (, &quot;Koiliōmēnē (Kyliomēnē) Porta&quot;, &quot;Rolled Gate&quot;), in Turkish &quot;Küçük Ayvansaray Kapısı&quot;. Shortly after stood the Gate of St. Anastasia (, &quot;Pylē tēs hagias Anastasias&quot;), located near the Atik Mustafa Pasha Mosque, hence in Turkish &quot;Atik Mustafa Paşa Kapısı&quot;. In close proximity on the outer side of the walls lay the Church of St. Nicholas Kanabos, which in 1597–1601 served as the cathedral of the Patriarch of Constantinople.
Further down the coast was the gate known in Turkish as &quot;Balat Kapı&quot; (&quot;Palace Gate&quot;), preceded in close order by three large archways, which served either as gates to the shore or to a harbour that serviced the imperial palace of Blachernae. Two gates are known to have existed in the vicinity in Byzantine times: the Kynegos Gate (, &quot;Pylē tou Kynēgou/tōn Kynēgōn&quot;, &quot;Gate of the Hunter(s)&quot;), whence the quarter behind it was named &quot;Kynegion&quot;, and the Gate of St. John the Forerunner and Baptist (, &quot;Porta tou hagiou Prodromou kai Baptistou&quot;), though it is not clear whether the latter was distinct from the Kynegos Gate. The &quot;Balat Kapı&quot; has been variously identified as one of them, and as one of the three gates on the Golden Horn known as the Imperial Gate (, &quot;Pylē Basilikē&quot;).

Further south was the Gate of the Phanarion (, &quot;Pylē tou Phanariou&quot;), Turkish &quot;Fener Kapısı&quot;, named after the local light-tower (&quot;phanarion&quot; in Greek), which also gave its name to the local suburb. The gate also marked the western entrance of the Petrion Fort (, &quot;kastron tōn Petriōn&quot;), formed by a double stretch of walls between the Gate of the Phanarion and the Petrion Gate (, &quot;Pylē tou Petriou&quot;), in Turkish &quot;Petri Kapısı&quot;. According to Byzantine tradition, the area was named thus after Peter the Patrician, a leading minister of Justinian I (r. 527–565). A small gate of the western end of the fort&#x27;s inner wall, near the Phanarion Gate, led to the city, and was called the Gate of Diplophanarion. It was at the Petrion Gate that the Venetians, under the personal leadership of Doge Enrico Dandolo, scaled the walls and entered the city in the 1204 sack. In the 1453 siege an Ottoman attack on the same place was repelled.

The next gate, &quot;Yeni Ayakapı&quot; (&quot;New Gate of the Saint&quot;), is not Byzantine, unless it replaces an earlier Byzantine entrance. It was constructed by the great Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan in 1582. Shortly after it lies the older &quot;Ayakapı&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Saint&quot;), known in Greek as the St. Theodosia Gate () after the nearby church of St. Theodosia (formerly identified with the Gül Mosque). The next gate is that of Eis Pegas (, &quot;Pylē eis Pēgas&quot;), known by Latin chroniclers as &quot;Porta Puteae&quot; or &quot;Porta del Pozzo&quot;, modern &quot;Cibali Kapısı&quot;. It was named so because it looked towards the quarter of Pegae (, &quot;Pēgai&quot;, &quot;springs&quot;) on the other shore of the Golden Horn. Next was the now-demolished Gate of the Platea (, &quot;Porta tēs Plateas&quot;) follows, rendered as &quot;Porta della Piazza&quot; by Italian chroniclers, and called in Turkish &quot;Unkapanı Kapısı&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Flour Depot&quot;). It was named after the local quarter of &quot;Plate[i]a&quot; (&quot;broad place&quot;, signifying the broad shoreline at this place). The next gate, &quot;Ayazma Kapısı&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Holy Well&quot;), is in all probability an Ottoman-era structure.

The next gate is the Gate of the Drungaries (, &quot;Pylē tōn Droungariōn&quot;), modern &quot;Odunkapısı&quot; (&quot;Wood Gate&quot;). Its Byzantine name derives from the high official known as the Drungary of the Watch. It marked the western end of the Venetian quarter. It is followed by the Gate the Forerunner, known as St. John de Cornibus by the Latins, named after a nearby chapel. In Turkish it is known as &quot;Zindan Kapısı&quot; (&quot;Dungeon Gate&quot;). The destroyed Gate of the Perama (, &quot;Porta tou Peramatos&quot;) lay in the suburb of Perama (&quot;Crossing&quot;), from which the ferry to Pera (Galata) sailed. It marked the eastern limit of the Venetian quarter of the city, and the beginning of the Amalfitan quarter to its east. In Buondelmonti&#x27;s map, it is labelled &quot;Porta Piscaria&quot;, on account of the fishmarket that used to be held there, a name that has been preserved in its modern Turkish appellation, &quot;Balıkpazarı Kapısı&quot;, &quot;Gate of the Fish-market&quot;. This gate is also identified with the Gate of the Jews (, &quot;Hebraïkē Porta&quot;), &quot;Porta Hebraica&quot; in Latin sources, although the same name was apparently applied over time to other gates as well. In its vicinity was probably also the Gate of St. Mark, which is recorded in a single Venetian document of 1229. Its identity is unclear, as is the question whether the gate, conspicuously named in honour of the patron saint of Venice, was pre-existing or opened after the fall of the city to the Crusaders in 1204.

To the east of the Perama Gate was the Hikanatissa Gate (, &quot;Porta tēs Hikanatissēs&quot;), a name perhaps derived from the imperial &quot;tagma&quot; of the &quot;Hikanatoi&quot;. The gate marked the eastern end of the Amalfitan quarter of the city and the western edge of the Pisan quarter. Further east lay the Gate of the Neorion (, &quot;Porta tou Neōriou&quot;), recorded as the Horaia Gate (, &quot;Pylē Horaia&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Gate&quot;) in late Byzantine and Ottoman times. As its names testifies, it led to the leading to the &quot;Neorion&quot;, the main harbour of ancient Byzantium and the oldest naval arsenal of the city. In the early Ottoman period, it was known in Turkish as the &quot;Çıfıtkapı&quot; (&quot;Hebrew Gate&quot;), but its modern name is &quot;Bahçekapı&quot; (&quot;Garden Gate&quot;). The eastern limit of the Pisan quarter was located a bit eastwards of the gate.

The 12th-century Genoese quarter of the city extended from there to the east, and in the documents conferring privileges on them one finds mention of two gates: the &quot;Porta Bonu&quot; (&quot;Gate of Bonus&quot;, probably transcribed from Greek ), and the &quot;Porta Veteris Rectoris&quot; (&quot;Gate of the old rector&quot;). It is very likely that these two names refer to the same gate, probably named after an otherwise unknown rector Bonus, and located somewhere in the modern Sirkeci district. Finally, the last gate of the Golden Horn wall was the Gate of Eugenius (, &quot;Porta tou Eugeniou&quot;), leading to the &quot;Prosphorion&quot; harbour. In close proximity was the 4th-century Tower of Eugenius or &quot;Kentenarion&quot;, where the great chain that closed the entrance to the Golden Horn was kept and suspended from. The gate was also called &quot;Marmaroporta&quot; (Μαρμαροπόρτα, &quot;Marble Gate&quot;), because it was covered in marble, and featured a statue of the Emperor Julian. It is usually identified with the Ottoman &quot;Yalıköşkü Kapısı&quot;, and was destroyed in 1871.

===Propontis Wall===

The wall of the Propontis was built almost at the shoreline, with the exception of harbours and quays, and had a height of 12–15 metres, with thirteen gates, and 188 towers. and a total length of almost 8,460 metres, with further 1,080 metres comprising the inner wall of the Vlanga harbour. Several sections of the wall were damaged during the construction of the &quot;Kennedy Caddesi&quot; coastal road in 1956–57. The wall&#x27;s proximity to the sea and the strong currents of the Propontis meant that eastern and southern shores of the peninsula were comparatively safe from attack, but conversely, the walls had to be protected against the sea itself: a breakwater of boulders was placed in front of their base, and marble shafts were used as bonds in the walls&#x27; base to enhance their structural integrity. From the cape at the edge of the ancient acropolis of the city (modern &quot;Sarayburnu&quot;, Seraglio Point), south and west to the Marble Tower, the Propontis Wall and its gates went as follows:
The first gate, now demolished, was the Eastern Gate (, &quot;Heōa Pylē&quot;) or Gate of St. Barbara (, &quot;Pylē tēs martyros Barbaras&quot;) after a nearby church, in Turkish &quot;Top Kapısı&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Cannon&quot;), from which Topkapı Palace takes its name. Unique among the seaward gates, it was, like the Golden Gate, flanked by two large towers of white marble, which in 1816 was used to construct the nearby Marble Kiosk of Sultan Mahmud II. Twice it served as the entry-point for an emperor&#x27;s triumphal return: in 1126, when John II Komnenos returned from the recapture of his ancestral Kastamonu, and in 1168, when Manuel I Komnenos returned from his victorious campaign against Hungary.

Next was the gate known in Turkish as &quot;Değirmen Kapı&quot; (&quot;Mill[stone] Gate&quot;), whose Byzantine name is unknown. Close by and to its north stood the great Tower of Mangana, which was intended to hold the one end of the chain, planned (but probably never actually installed) by Manuel I Komnenos to close off the Bosphorus, the other end being at a tower erected on the island of the modern Maiden&#x27;s Tower (&quot;Kız Kulesi&quot;) off Chrysopolis (modern Üsküdar), known as &quot;Damalis&quot; (Δάμαλις) or &quot;Arkla&quot; () in Byzantine times. The next gate is now known as the &quot;Demirkapı&quot; (&quot;Iron Gate&quot;), and is an Ottoman-era structure. A Greek name is not known, and it is not known whether a gate stood there in Byzantine times. Behind these two gates extended the quarter of the &quot;Mangana&quot; (Μάγγανα, &quot;Arsenal&quot;), with its numerous monasteries, the most famous of which were those of St. George of Mangana, the Church of Christ Philanthropos, and of the &quot;Theotokos Hodegetria&quot;, and the Palace of Mangana. Four small posterns, in two pairs of two, stand at the southern edge of the &quot;Mangana&quot; quarter, and probably serviced the numerous churches. The names, but not the identity, of two of them have been recorded, the Postern of St. Lazarus (, &quot;pylis tou hagiou Lazarou&quot;), and the Small Gate of the &quot;Hodegetria&quot; (, &quot;mikra pylē tēs Hodēgētrias&quot;), both named after the respective monasteries located near them. It is also probable that one of them is to be identified with the Postern of Michael the Protovestiarios (, &quot;parapylis tou Michaēl tou prōtovestiariou&quot;).
Further south, at the point where the shore turns westwards, are two further gates, the &quot;Balıkhane Kapısı&quot; (&quot;Gate of the Fish-House&quot;) and &quot;Ahırkapısı&quot; (&quot;Stable Gate&quot;). Their names derive from the buildings inside the Topkapı Palace they led to. Their Byzantine names are unknown. The next gate, on the southeastern corner of the city, was the gate of the imperial Boukoleon Palace, known in Byzantine times as the Gate of the Lion (Gk. Πόρτα Λέοντος, &quot;Porta Leontos&quot;, in Latin &quot;Porta Leonis&quot;) after the marble lions that flanked its entrance, as well as Gate of the Bear (, &quot;porta tēs arkoudas&quot;) after depictions of that animal at the quay. In Turkish it is known as &quot;Çatladıkapı&quot; (&quot;Broken Gate&quot;).

To the west of the Bucoleon Palace lies the Church of SS. Sergius and Bacchus, and the first of the harbours of the city&#x27;s southern shore, that of the Sophiae, named after the wife of Emperor Justin II (r. 565–578) and known originally as the Port of Julian. A small postern is situated in front of the church, while the first larger gate, the Gate of the Sophiae (, &quot;Porta tōn Sophiōn&quot;) or Iron Gate (, &quot;Porta Sidēra&quot;), opened to the harbour. In Turkish, it is known as &quot;Kadırgalimanı Kapısı&quot;, &quot;Gate of the Harbour of the Galleys&quot;. Next was the Gate of Kontoskalion (), modern &quot;Kumkapısı&quot; (&quot;Sand Gate&quot;), which opened to the late Byzantine harbour of the same name, intended to replace the long silted-up Harbour of the Sophiae.

The next harbour to the west is the large Harbour of Eleutherius or Theodosius, in the area known as &quot;Vlanga&quot;. The harbours are now silted up and known as the &quot;Langa Bostan&quot; park. Immediately before it to the east stands the gate known in Turkish as the &quot;Yenikapı&quot; (&quot;New Gate&quot;). A Latin inscription commemorates its repair after the 447 earthquake It is usually identified with the Jewish Gate of late Byzantine times. Immediately to the west after the harbour lies the next gate, &quot;Davutpaşa Kapısı&quot; (&quot;Gate of Davut Pasha&quot;), usually identified with the Gate of Saint Aemilianus (, &quot;Porta tou hagiou Aimilianou&quot;), which is known to have stood at the junction of the sea wall with the city&#x27;s original Constantinian Wall. That view is disputed by Janin, as the junction of the walls occurred considerably to the west from the modern gate&#x27;s location.

Further to the west, where the shoreline turns sharply south, stood the Gate of Psamathia (, &quot;Porta tou Psamatha/Psamatheos&quot;), modern &quot;Samatya Kapısı&quot;, leading to the suburb of the same name. Further south and west lies the gate known today as &quot;Narlıkapı&quot; (&quot;Pomegranate Gate&quot;). Its Byzantine name is unknown, but is prominent on account of its proximity to the famed Monastery of Stoudios.

==Garrisons of the city==
During the whole existence of the Byzantine Empire, the garrison of the city was quite small: the imperial guards and the small city watch (the &quot;pedatoura&quot; or &quot;kerketon&quot;) under the urban prefect were the only permanent armed force available. Any threat to the city would have to be dealt with by the field armies in the provinces, before it could approach the city itself. In times of need, such as the earthquake of 447 or the raids by the Avars in the early 7th century, the general population, organized in the guilds and the hippodrome factions, would be conscripted and armed, or additional troops would be brought in from the provincial armies.

In the early centuries, the imperial guard consisted of the units of the &quot;Excubitores&quot; and &quot;Scholae Palatinae&quot;, which by the late 7th century had declined to parade-ground troops. At about that time Justinian II established the first new guards units to protect the imperial palace precinct, while in the 8th century the emperors, faced with successive revolts by the thematic armies and pursuing deeply unpopular iconoclastic policies, established the imperial &quot;tagmata&quot; as an elite force loyal to them. As the &quot;tagmata&quot; were often used to form the core of imperial expeditionary armies, they were not always present in or near the city. Only two of them, the &quot;Noumeroi&quot; and the &quot;Teicheiōtai&quot;, the palace guard units established by Justinian II, remained permanently stationed in Constantinople, garrisoned around the palace district or in various locations, such as disused churches, in the capital. The units present in the city at any one time were thus never very numerous, numbering a few thousands at best, but they were complemented by several detachments stationed around the capital, in Thrace and Bithynia.

The small size of the city&#x27;s garrison was due to the uneasiness of emperors and populace alike towards a permanent large military force, both for fear of a military uprising and because of the considerable financial burden its maintenance would entail. Furthermore, a large force was largely unnecessary, because of the inherent security provided by the city walls themselves. As historian John Haldon notes, &quot;providing the gates were secured and the defenses provided with a skeleton force, the City was safe against even very large forces in the pre-gunpowder period.&quot;

==Fortifications around Constantinople==

===Anastasian Wall===

Several fortifications were built at various periods in the vicinity of Constantinople, forming part of its defensive system. The first and greatest of these is the 56 km long Anastasian Wall (Gk. , &quot;teichos Anastasiakon&quot;) or Long Wall (, &quot;makron teichos&quot;, or , &quot;megalē Souda&quot;), built in the mid-5th century as an outer defence to Constantinople, some 65 km westwards of the city. It was 3.30 m thick and over 5 m high, but its effectiveness was apparently limited, and it was abandoned at some time in the 7th century for want of resources to maintain and men to garrison it. For centuries thereafter, its materials were used in local buildings, but several parts, especially in the remoter central and northern sections, are still extant.

In addition, between the Anastasian Wall and the city itself, there were several small towns and fortresses like Selymbria, Region or the great suburb of &quot;Hebdomon&quot; (&quot;Seventh&quot;, modern Bakırköy, so named from its distance of seven Roman miles from the Milion, the city&#x27;s mile-marker), the site of major military encampments. Beyond the Long Walls, the towns of Bizye and Arcadiopolis covered the northern approaches. These localities were strategically situated along the main routes to the city, and formed the outer defenses of Constantinople throughout its history, serving to muster forces, confront enemy invasions or at least buy time for the capital&#x27;s defenses to be brought in order. It is notable that during the final Ottoman siege, several of them, such as Selymbria, surrendered only after the fall of Constantinople itself. In Asia Minor, their role was mirrored by the cities of Nicaea and Nicomedia, and the large field camp at Malagina.

===Walls of Galata===
Galata, then the suburb of Sykai, was an integral part of the city by the early 5th century: the &quot;Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae&quot; of ca. 425 names it as the city&#x27;s 13th region. It was probably fortified with walls in the 5th century, and under Justinian I it was granted the status of a city. The settlement declined and disappeared after the 7th century, leaving only the great tower (the &quot;kastellion tou Galatou&quot;) in modern Karaköy, that guarded the chain extending across the mouth of the Golden Horn. After the sack of the city in 1204, Galata became a Venetian quarter, and later a Genoese extraterritorial colony, effectively outside Byzantine control. Despite Byzantine opposition, the Genoese managed to surround their quarter with a moat, and by joining their castle-like houses with walls they created the first wall around the colony. The Galata Tower, then called &quot;Christea Turris&quot; (&quot;Tower of Christ&quot;), and another stretch of walls to its north were built in 1349. Further expansions followed in 1387, 1397 and 1404, enclosing an area larger than that originally allocated to them, stretching from the modern district of Azapkapı north to Şişhane, from there to Tophane and thence to Karaköy. After the Ottoman conquest, the walls were maintained until the 1870s, when most were demolished to facilitate the expansion of the city. Today only the Galata Tower, visible from most of historical Constantinople, remains intact, along with several smaller fragments.

===Anadolu and Rumeli fortresses===
The twin forts of Anadoluhisarı and Rumelihisarı lie to the north of Istanbul, at the narrowest point of the Bosphorus. They were built by the Ottomans to control this strategically vital waterway in preparation for their final assault on Constantinople. &quot;Anadoluhisarı&quot; (Turkish for &quot;Fortress of Anatolia&quot;), also called and (&quot;beautiful fortress&quot;) in earlier times, was constructed by Bayezid I in 1394, and initially consisted of just a high, roughly pentagonal watchtower surrounded by a wall. The much larger and more elaborate (&quot;Fortress of Rumeli&quot;) was built by Sultan Mehmed II in just over four months in 1452. It consists of three large and one small towers, connected by a wall reinforced with 13 small watchtowers. With cannons mounted on its main towers, the fort gave the Ottomans complete control of the passage of ships through Bosphorus, a role evoked by its original name, (&quot;cutter of the strait&quot;). After the conquest of Constantinople, it served as a customs checkpoint and a prison, particularly for the embassies of states that were at war with the empire. After suffering extensive damage in the 1509 earthquake, it was repaired, and was used continuously until the late 19th century.

<doc id="607457" wikidata="Q26634" url="?curid=607457" title="Crown-of-thorns starfish">
<text>The crown-of-thorns starfish (frequently abbreviated to COTS), Acanthaster planci, is a large starfish that preys upon hard, or stony, coral polyps (Scleractinia). The crown-of-thorns starfish receives its name from venomous thornlike spines that cover its upper surface, resembling the biblical crown of thorns. It is one of the largest starfish in the world.

&quot;A. planci&quot; has a very wide Indo-Pacific distribution. It is perhaps most common around Australia, but can occur at tropical and subtropical latitudes from the Red Sea and the East African coast across the Indian Ocean, and across the Pacific Ocean to the west coast of Central America. It occurs where coral reefs or hard coral communities occur in the region.

==Description==
The body form of the crown-of-thorns starfish is fundamentally the same as that of a typical starfish, with a central disk and radiating arms. Its special traits, however, include being disc-shaped, multiple-armed, flexible, prehensile, heavily spined, and having a large ratio of stomach surface to body mass. Its prehensile ability arises from the two rows of numerous tube feet that extend to the tip of each arm. In being multiple-armed, it has lost the five-fold symmetry (pentamerism) typical of starfish, although it begins its lifecycle with this symmetry. The animal has true image-forming vision.

Adult crown-of-thorns starfish normally range in size from . They have up to 21 arms. Although the body of the crown of thorns has a stiff appearance, it is able to bend and twist to fit around the contours of the corals on which it feeds. The underside of each arm has a series of closely fitting plates, which form a groove and extend in rows to the mouth. Depending on diet or geographic region, individuals can be purple, purple-blue, reddish grey or brown with red spine tips, or green with yellow spine tips.

The long, sharp spines on the sides of the starfish&#x27;s arms and upper (aboral) surface resemble thorns and create a crown-like shape, giving the creature its name. The spines can range from 4 to 5 cm long and are stiff, very sharp, and readily pierce through soft surfaces. Despite the battery of sharp spines on the aboral surface and blunt spines on the oral surface, the crown-of-thorns starfish&#x27;s general body surface is membranous and soft. When the starfish is removed from the water, the body surface ruptures and the body fluid leaks out, so the body collapses and flattens. The spines bend over and flatten, as well. They recover their shape when reimmersed, if they are still alive.

==Taxonomy==

===Family===

The family Acanthasteridae is monogeneric; its position within the Asteroides is unsettled. It is generally recognized as a distinctly isolated taxon. Recently, paleontologist Daniel Blake concluded from comparative morphology studies of &quot;A. planci&quot; that it has strong similarities with various members of the Oreasteridae. He transferred the Acanthasteridae from the Spinulosida to the Valvatida and assigned it a position near to the Oreasteridae, from which it appears to be derived. He attributed &quot;Acanthaster&quot; morphology as possibly evolving in association with its locomotion over irregular coral surfaces in higher energy environments. A complication exists, however, in that &quot;Acanthaster&quot; is not a monospecific genus and any consideration of the genus must also take into account another species, &quot;Acanthaster brevispinus&quot;, which lives in a completely different environment. &quot;A. brevispinus&quot; lives on soft substrates, perhaps buried in the substrate at times like other soft substrate-inhabiting starfish, at moderate depths, where presumably the surface is regular and little wave action occurs.

===Genus and species===
&quot;A. planci&quot; has a long history in the scientific literature with great confusion in the generic and specific names from the outset, with a long list of complex synonyms. Georg Eberhard Rhumphius first described it in 1705, naming it &quot;Stella marina quindecium radiotorum&quot;. Later, Carl Linnaeus described it as &quot;Asterias planci&quot; based on an illustration by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743), when he introduced his system of binomial nomenclature. No type specimens are known; the specimen described by Plancus and Gualtieri (1743) is no longer extant.

Subsequent generic names used for the crown-of-thorns starfish included &quot;Stellonia&quot;, &quot;Echinaster&quot;, and &quot;Echinites&quot;, before settling on &quot;Acanthaster&quot; (Gervais 1841). Specific names included &quot;echintes&quot;, &quot;solaris&quot;, &quot;mauritensis&quot;, &quot;ellisii&quot;, and &quot;ellisii pseudoplanci&quot; (with subspecies). Most of these names arose from confusion in the historical literature, but &quot;Acanthaster ellisii&quot; came to be used for the distinctive starfish in the eastern Pacific Gulf of California.

The eastern Pacific &quot;Acanthaster&quot; is very distinctive (see image to the right) with its rather &#x27;plump&#x27; body, large disk to total diameter ratio, and short, blunt spines. 

===Genetic studies===

Nishida and Lucas examined genetic variation at 14 allozyme loci of 10 population samples of &quot;A. planci&quot; using starch-gel electrophoresis. The samples were from localities across the Pacific: Ryukyu archipelago (four locations), Micronesia (two locations), and samples from one location each of the Great Barrier Reef, Fiji, Hawaii, and the Gulf of California. A sample of 10 specimens of &quot;A. brevispinus&quot; from the Great Barrier Reef region was included for comparison. Considerable genetic differentiation was seen between the &quot;A. brevispinus&quot; and &quot;A. planci&quot; populations (D= 0.20 +/− 0.02)(D is genetic distance). The genetic differences between geographic populations of &quot;A. planci&quot; were, however, small (D = 0.03 +/− 0.00; Fsr = 0.07 + 0.02) (Fsr is standardized genetic variance for each polymorphic locus) despite the great distances separating them. A positive correlation was observed between degree of genetic differentiation and geographic distance, suggesting the genetic homogeneity among &quot;A. planci&quot; populations is due to gene flow by planktonic larval dispersion. The distance effect on genetic differentiation most probably reflects decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances. In view of the level of macrogeographic homogeneity, significant allele frequency differences were observed between adjacent populations separated by about 10 km. The Hawaiian population was most differentiated from other populations. Treating the morphologically distinctive, eastern Pacific &quot;Acanthaster&quot; as a separate species, &quot;A. ellisii&quot;, is not supported by these data. The lack of unique alleles in the central (Hawaii) and eastern Pacific (Gulf of California) populations suggests they were derived from those in the western Pacific.

Further details of the genetic relationship between &quot;A. planci&quot; and &quot;A. brevispinus&quot; are presented in the entry for the latter species. These are clearly sibling species, and &quot;A. planci&quot;, the specialized, coral-feeding species, is suggested to have arisen from &quot;A. brevispinus&quot;, the less-specialized, soft-bottom inhabitant.

In a very comprehensive geographic study, Benzie examined allozyme loci variation in 20 populations of &quot; A. planci&quot;, throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The most striking result was a very marked discontinuity between the Indian and Pacific Ocean populations. Those, however, off northern Western Australia had a strong Pacific affinity. With the exception of the very strong connection of southern Japanese populations to the Great Barrier Reef populations, the patterns of variation within regions were consistent with isolation by distance. Again, the pattern of decreasing levels of successful larval dispersal over long distances is apparent. Benzie suggests that the divergence between Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean populations began at least 1.6 million years ago and is likely to reflect responses to changes in climate and sea level.

A more recent comprehensive geographic study of &quot;A. planci&quot; by Vogler &quot;et al.&quot;, using DNA analyses (one mitochondrial gene), suggests it is actually a species complex consisting of four species or clades. The four cryptic species/clades are defined geographically: Northern Indian Ocean, southern Indian Ocean, Red Sea, and Pacific Ocean. These molecular data suggest the species/clades diverged 1.95 and 3.65 million years ago. (The divergence of &quot;A. planci&quot; and &quot;A. brevispinus&quot; is not included in this time scale.) The authors suggest the differences between the four putative species in behavior, diet, or habitat may be important for the design of appropriate reef-conservation strategies.

Problems exist, though, with this proposal of cryptic speciation (cryptic species). The basis of these data from one mitochondrial gene (mtDNA) data is, however, only one source of information about the status of taxa and the use of one mtDNA gene as a sole criterion for species identification is disputed. The allozyme data should also be taken into account. Three localities that were sampled by Vogler &quot;et al.&quot; are of particular interest; Palau Sebibu, UEA, and Oman were found to have two clades/sibling species in sympatry. These are important to investigate the nature of the co-existence and barriers to introgression of genetic material. &quot;A. planci&quot; as a taxon is a generalist, being amongst the most ubiquitous of large coral predators on coral reefs, feeding on virtually all hard coral species, reproducing during summer without a pattern of spawning, and often participating in mass multiple-species spawnings, and releasing vast amounts of gametes that trigger spawning in other individuals. Conceiving of two species/clades of &quot;A. planci&quot; in sympatry without habitat competition and introgression of genetic material, especially the latter, is very difficult.

==Biology==

===Toxins===

Starfish are characterized by having saponins known as in their tissues. They contain a mix of these saponins, and at least 15 chemical studies have been conducted seeking to characterize these saponins. They have detergent-like properties, and keeping starfish in limited water volumes with aeration results in large amounts of foam at the surface.

&quot;A. planci&quot; has no mechanism for injecting the toxin, but as the spines perforate tissue of a predator or unwary person, tissue containing the saponins is lost into the wound. In humans, this immediately causes a sharp, stinging pain that can last for several hours, persistent bleeding due to the haemolytic effect of saponins, and nausea and tissue swelling that may persist for a week or more. The spines, which are brittle, may also break off and become embedded in the tissue, where they must be surgically removed.

Saponins seem to occur throughout the lifecycle of the crown-of-thorns starfish. The saponins in the eggs are similar to those in the adult tissues, and presumably these carry over to the larvae. The mouthing behaviour of predators of juvenile starfish with rejection suggests the juveniles contain saponins.

===Behavior===

The adult crown-of-thorns is a corallivorous predator that usually preys on reef scleractinian coral polyps, as well as encrusting sessile invertebrates and dead animals. It climbs onto a section of living coral colony using the large number of tube feet, which lie in distinct ambulacral grooves on the oral surface. It fits closely to the surface of the coral, even the complex surfaces of branching corals. It then extrudes its stomach out through its mouth over the surface to virtually its own diameter. The stomach surface secretes digestive enzymes that allow the starfish to absorb nutrients from the liquefied coral tissue. This leaves a white scar of coral skeleton that is rapidly infested with filamentous algae. An individual starfish can consume up to of living coral reef per year. In a study of feeding rates on two coral reefs in the central Great Barrier Reef region, large starfish ( and greater diameter) killed about /day in winter and per day in summer. Smaller starfish, , killed per day in the equivalent seasons. The area killed by the large starfish is equivalent to about from these observations. Differences in feeding and locomotion rates between summer and winter reflect the fact that the crown-of-thorns, like all marine invertebrates, is a poikilotherm whose body temperature and metabolic rate are directly affected by the temperature of the surrounding water. In tropical coral reefs, crown-of-thorns specimens reach mean locomotion rates of , which explains how outbreaks can damage large reef areas in relatively short periods.

The starfish show preferences between the hard corals on which they feed. They tend to feed on branching corals and table-like corals, such as &quot;Acropora&quot;, &quot;Pavona&quot;, and &quot;Pocillopora&quot; species, rather than on more rounded corals with less exposed surface area, such as &quot;Porites&quot; species. Avoidance of &quot;Porites&quot; and some other corals may also be due to resident bivalve mollusks and polychaete worms in the surface of the coral, which discourage the starfish. Similarly, some symbionts, such as small crabs, living within the complex structures of branching corals, may ward off the starfish as it seeks to spread its stomach over the coral surface.

In reef areas of low densities of hard coral, reflecting the nature of the reef community or due to feeding by high density crown-of-thorns, the starfish may be found feeding on soft corals (Alcyonacea).

The starfish are cryptic in behavior during their first two years, emerging at night to feed. They usually remain so as adults when solitary. The only evidence of a hidden individual may be white feeding scars on adjacent coral. However, their behavior changes under two circumstances:
* During the breeding season, which is typically during early to midsummer, the starfish may gather together high on a reef and synchronously release gametes to achieve high levels of egg fertilization. This pattern of synchronized spawning is not at all unique, but it is very common amongst marine invertebrates that do not copulate. Solitary spawning gives no opportunity for fertilization of eggs and wastes gametes and evidence exists of a spawning pheromone that causes the starfish to aggregate and release gametes synchronously.
* When the starfish are at high densities, they may move day and night, competing for living coral.
‘A. planci forage on corals at a high rate especially when the populations occur therefore resulting to loss of reef habitats and overall, loss of species Diversity.’ Research shows that when such populations of these starfish are found, they can destroy coral and alter the structure of reefs and its support marine organism (Brodie et al., 2005)”.

===Predators===
The elongated, sharp spines covering nearly the entire upper surface of the crown-of-thorns serve as a mechanical defense against large predators. It also has a chemical defense. Saponins presumably serve as an irritant when the spines pierce a predator, in the same way as they do when they pierce the skin of humans. Saponins have an unpleasant taste. A study to test the predation rate on juvenile &quot;Acanthaster&quot; spp. by appropriate fish species found that the starfish were often mouthed, tasted, and rejected. These defenses tend to make it an unattractive target for coral community predators. In spite of this, however, &quot;Acanthaster&quot; populations are typically composed of a proportion of individuals with regenerating arms.

About 11 species have been reported to prey occasionally on uninjured and healthy adults of &quot;A. planci&quot;. All of these are generalist feeders, but none of these seems to specifically prefer the starfish as a food source. This number, however, is probably lower, as some of these presumed predators have not been witnessed reliably in the field. Some of those witnessed are:
* A species of pufferfish and two triggerfish have been observed to feed on crown-of-thorns starfish in the Red Sea, and although they may have some effect on the &quot;A. planci&quot; population, no evidence exists of systematic predation. In the Indo-Pacific waters, white-spotted puffers, and Titan triggerfish have also been found to eat this starfish.
* Triton&#x27;s trumpet, a very large gastropod mollusk, is a known predator of &quot;Acanthaster&quot; in some parts of the starfish&#x27;s range. The Triton has been described as tearing the starfish to pieces with its file-like radula.
* The small painted shrimp &quot;Hymenocera picta&quot;, a general predator of starfish, has been found to prey on &quot;A. planci&quot; at some locations. A polychaete worm, &quot;Pherecardia striata&quot;, was observed to be feeding on the starfish together with the shrimp on an east Pacific coral reef. About 0.6% of the starfish in the reef population were being attacked by both the shrimp and polychaete worm, killing the starfish in about a week. Glynn suggested this resulted in a balance between mortality and recruitment in this population, leading to a relatively stable population of starfish.
* Since &quot;P. striata&quot; can only attack a damaged &quot;A. planci&quot; and cause its death, it may be regarded as an &quot;impatient scavenger&quot; rather than a predator. As distinct from predators, dead and mutilated adults of &quot;A. planci&quot; attract a number of scavengers. Glynn lists two polychaete worms, a hermit crab, a sea urchin, and seven species of small reef fish. Apparently, they are able to tolerate the distasteful saponins for an easy meal.
* A large, polyp-like creature of the cnidarian genus &quot;Pseudocorynactis&quot; was observed attacking, and then wholly ingesting a crown-of-thorns starfish of similar size. Continued studies revealed this polyp is able to completely ingest a crown-of-thorns specimen up to in diameter.

==Lifecycle==

===Gametes and embryos===
Gonads increase in size as the animals become sexually mature, and at maturity, fill the arms and extend into the disk region. The ripe ovaries and testes are readily distinguishable, with the former being more yellow and having larger lobes. In section, they are very different, with the ovaries densely filled with nutrient-packed ova (see ovum and photograph) and the testes densely filled with sperm, which consist of little more than a nucleus and flagellum. Fecundity in female crown-of-thorns starfish is related to size, with large starfish committing proportionally more energy into ova production such that:
* A 200-mm-diameter female produces 0.5–2.5 million eggs, representing 2–8% of her wet weight.
* A 300-mm-diameter female produces 6.5–14 million eggs, representing 9–14% of her wet weight.
* A 400-mm-diameter female produces 47–53 million eggs, representing 20–25% of her wet weight.

In coral reefs in the Philippines, female specimens were found with a gonadosomatic index (ratio of gonad mass to body mass) as high as 22%, which underlines the high fecundity of this starfish. Babcock et al. (1993) monitored changes in fecundity and fertility (fertilisation rate) over the spawning season of the crown-of-thorns starfish on Davies Reef, central Great Barrier Reef, from 1990 to 1992. The starfish were observed to spawn (photograph) from December to January (early to midsummer) in this region with most observations being in January. However, both gonadosomatic index and fertility peaked early and declined to low levels by late January, indicating that most successful reproductive events took place early in the spawning season. In Northern Hemisphere coral reefs, however, crown-of-thorns populations reproduce in April and May, and were also observed spawning in the Gulf of Thailand in September. High rates of egg fertilisation may be achieved through the behaviour of proximate and synchronised spawning (see above in Behaviour).

Embryonic development begins about 1.5 hours after fertilisation, with the early cell divisions (cleavage) (photograph). By 8–9 hours, it has reached the 64-cell stage.

Some molecular and histological evidence suggests the occurrence of hermaphroditism in &quot;Acanthaster&quot; cf. &quot;solaris&quot;.

===Larval stages===
By day 1, the embryo has hatched as a ciliated gastrula stage (photograph). By day 2, the gut is complete and the larva is now known as a bipinnaria. It has ciliated bands along the body and uses these to swim and filter feed on microscopic particles, particularly unicellular green flagellates (phytoplankton). The scanning electron micrograph (SEM) clearly shows the complex ciliated bands of the bipinnarial larva. By day 5, it is an early brachiolarial larva. The arms of the bipinnaria have further elongated, two stump-like projections are in the anterior (not evident in the photograph), and structures are developing within the posterior of the larva. In the late brachiolarial larva (day 11), the larval arms are elongated and three distinctive arms occur at the anterior with small structures on their inner surfaces. To this stage, the larva has been virtually transparent, but the posterior section is now opaque with the initial development of a starfish. The late brachiolaria is 1.0–1.5 mm. It tends to sink to the bottom and test the substrate with its brachiolar arms, including flexing the anterior body to orient the brachiolar arms against the substrate.

This description and assessment of optimum rate of development is based on early studies in the laboratory under attempted optimum conditions. However, not unexpectedly, there are large differences in growth rate and survival under various environmental conditions (see Causes of population outbreaks).

===Metamorphosis, development, and growth===
The late brachiolaria search substrates with their arms, and when offered a choice of substrates, tend to settle on coralline algae, on which they subsequently feed. In the classic pattern for echinoderms, the bilaterally symmetrical larva is replaced by a pentamerously symmetrical stage at metamorphosis, with the latter&#x27;s body axis bearing no relationship to that of the larva. Thus, the newly metamorphosed starfish are five-armed and are 0.4–1.0 mm in diameter. (Note the size of the tube feet relative to the size of the animal.) They feed on the thin coating layers of hard, encrusting algae (coralline algae) on the undersides of dead coral rubble and other concealed surfaces. They extend their stomach over the surface of the encrusting algae and digest the tissue, as in the feeding by larger crown-of-thorns starfish on hard corals. The living tissue of the encrusting algae is approximately pink to dark red, and feeding by these early juveniles results in white scars on the surface of the algae. During the next months, the juveniles grow and add arms and associated madreporites in the pattern described by Yamaguchi until the adult numbers are attained 5–7 months after metamorphosis. Two hard corals with small polyps, &quot;Pocillopora damicornis&quot; and &quot;Acropora acunimata&quot;, were included in the aquaria with the encrusting algae, and at about the time the juvenile starfish achieved their full number of arms, they began feeding on the corals.

Juveniles of &quot;A. planci&quot; that had reached the stage of feeding on coral were then reared for some years in the same large closed-circuit seawater system that was used for the early juveniles. They were moved to larger tanks and kept supplied with coral so that food was not a limiting factor on growth rate. The growth curves of size versus age were sigmoidal, as seen in majority marine invertebrates. An initial period of relatively slow growth occurred while the starfish were feeding on coralline algae. This was followed by a phase of rapid growth, which led to sexual maturity at the end of the second year. The starfish were in the vicinity of 200 mm in diameter at this stage. They continued to grow rapidly and were around 300 and tended to decline after 4 years. Gonad development was greater in the third and subsequent years than at 2 years, and a seasonal pattern of gametogenesis and spawning became apparent, with water temperature being the only notable cue in the indoor aquarium. Most specimens of &quot;A. planci&quot; died from &quot;senility&quot; during the period 5.0–7.5 years, i.e. they fed poorly and shrank.

===Field observations of lifecycle===
The data above are derived from laboratory studies of &quot;A. planci&quot;, which are much more readily obtained than equivalent data from the field. The laboratory observations, however, are in accord with the limited field observations of lifecycle.

As in laboratory studies where &quot;A. planci&quot; larvae were found to select coralline algae for settlement, early juveniles (&lt;20 mm in diameter) were found on subtidal coralline algae (&quot;Porolithon onkodes&quot;) on the windward reef front of Suva Reef (Fiji). The juveniles were found in a variety of habitats where they were highly concealed - under coral blocks and rubble in the boulder zone of the exposed reef front, on dead bases of &quot;Acropora&quot; species in more sheltered areas, in narrow spaces within the reef crest, and on the fore-reef slope to depths of 8 m.

Growth rates on Suva Reef were found to be 2.6, 16.7 and 5.3 mm/month increase in diameter before coral feeding, in early coral feeding, and in adult phases, respectively. This is in accord with the sigmoidal pattern of size versus age observed in laboratory studies, i.e. slow initial growth, a phase of very rapid growth beginning at coral feeding and tapering off of growth after the starfish reaches sexual maturity. In reefs in the Philippines, female and male specimens matured at 13 and 16 cm, respectively.

Stump identified bands in the upper surface spines of &quot;A. planci&quot;, and attributed these to annual growth bands. He did not report growth rates based on these age determinations, and mark and recapture data, but he reported that the growth bands revealed 12+ year-old starfish: much older than those that became &#x27;senile&#x27; and died in the laboratory.

In a small number of field studies, mortality rates of juvenile A. planci have to found to be very high, e.g. 6.5% per day for month-old and 0.45% per day for 7-month-old. Most of the mortality comes from predators, such as small crabs, that occur in and on the substrate with the juveniles. It is possible, however, that these rates may not reflect mortality over the range of habitats occupied by small juveniles.

==Ecology==

===Ecological impact on reefs===


&quot;A. planci&quot; is one of the most efficient predators on scleractinian corals (stony corals or hard corals). Most coral-feeding organisms only cause tissue loss or localized injuries, but adults of &quot;A. planci&quot; can kill entire coral colonies.

Popular anxiety to news of high densities of &quot;A. planci&quot; on the Great Barrier Reef was reflected in many newspaper reports and publications such as &quot;Requiem for the Reef&quot;, which also suggested that a cover-up of the extent of damage existed. A popular idea arose that the coral and with it whole reefs were being destroyed by the starfish. In fact, as described above, the starfish preys on coral by digesting the surface of living tissue from the coral skeletons. These skeletons persist, together with the mass of coralline algae that is essential for reef integrity. The initial change (first-order effect) is loss of the veneer of living coral tissue.

&quot;A. planci&quot; is a component of the fauna of most coral reefs and the effects of &quot;A. planci&quot; populations on coral reefs are very dependent on the population density. At low densities (1 to perhaps 30/hectare) the rate at which coral is being preyed upon by the starfish, is less than the growth rate of the coral, i.e. the surface area of living coral is increasing. The starfish may, however, influence the coral community structure. Because the starfish do not feed indiscriminately they may cause a distribution of coral species and colony sizes that differs from a pattern without them. This is evident by comparison of coral reefs where &quot;A. planci&quot; has not been found to the more typical reefs with &quot;A. planci&quot;.

Some ecologists suggest that the starfish has an important and active role in maintaining coral reef biodiversity, driving ecological succession. Before overpopulation became a significant issue, crown-of-thorns prevented fast-growing coral from overpowering the slower-growing coral varieties.

At high densities (outbreaks, plagues), which may be defined as when the starfish are too abundant for the coral food supply, coral cover goes into decline. The starfish must broaden their diet from their preferred species, colony size, and shape. The starfish often aggregate during feeding, even at low densities, but during high densities, the cleared coral patches become almost or completely continuous.
Second-order effects exist for these large areas of preyed coral:
* The bare coral skeletons are rapidly colonised by filamentous algae.
* Large stands of staghorn coral, &quot;Acropora&quot; species, may collapse and become rubble, reducing the topographical complexity of the reef 
* Sometimes, the preyed surfaces are further invaded by macroalgae, soft coral, and sponges. These tend to take over reef surfaces for long periods, as alternatives to hard coral communities; once established, they limit recruitment by hard-coral larvae.

Aesthetically, in all the above cases, the reef surface is not as attractive as the living coral surface, but it is anything but dead.

A third-order effect can arise from the invasion by filamentous algae. Animals that depend directly or indirectly on hard corals, e.g. for shelter and food, should lose out, and herbivores and less specialist feeders gain. This likely would be most conspicuous in the fish fauna, and long-terms studies of coral reef-fish communities confirm this expectation.

===Population outbreaks===

Large populations of crown-of-thorns starfish (sometimes emotively known as plagues) have been substantiated as occurring at 21 locations of coral reefs during the 1960s to 1980s. These locations ranged from the Red Sea through the tropical Indo-Pacific region to French Polynesia. At least two substantiated repeated outbreaks occurred at 10 of these locations.

Values of starfish density from 140 to 1,000/ha have been considered in various reports to be outbreak populations, while starfish densities less than 100/ha have been considered to be low; however, at densities below 100/ha, feeding by &quot;A. planci&quot; may exceed the growth of coral with a net loss of coral.

From the surveys of many reef locations throughout the starfish&#x27;s distribution, large abundances of &quot;Acanthaster&quot; spp. can be categorised as:
* Primary outbreaks, where abrupt population increases of at least two magnitudes cannot be explained by the presence of a previous outbreak
* Secondary outbreaks can plausibly be related to previous outbreaks through the reproduction of a previous cohort of the starfish. These may appear as recruits to reefs down current from an existing outbreak population.
* Chronic situations where a persistent moderate to high density population exists at a reef location where the coral is sparse due to persistent feeding by the starfish.

The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is the most outstanding coral reef system in the world because of its great length, number of individual reefs, and species diversity. When high densities of &quot;Acanthaster&quot;, which were causing heavy mortality of coral, were first seen about Green Island, off Cairns, in 1960–65, this caused considerable alarm. High-density populations were subsequently found of a number of reefs to the south of Green Island, in the central GBR region Some popular publications suggested that the whole reef was in danger of dying, and they influenced and reflected some public alarm over the state and future of the GBR.

A number of studies have modeled the population outbreaks on the GBR as a means to understand the phenomenon.

The Australian and Queensland governments funded research and set up advisory committees during the period of great anxiety about the nature of the starfish outbreaks on the GBR. They were regarded as not coming to terms with the unprecedented nature and magnitude of this problem. Many scientists were criticised for not being able to give definitive but unsubstantiated answers. Others were more definitive in their answers. Scientists were criticised for their reticence and for disagreeing on the nature and causes of the outbreaks on the GBR, sometimes described as the &quot;starfish wars&quot;.

===Causes of population outbreaks===
Serious discussion and some strongly held views mention the causes of this phenomenon. Some hypotheses focused on changes in the survival of juvenile and adult starfish—the &quot;predator removal hypothesis&quot;:
* Over-collecting of tritons, a predator of the starfish
* Overfishing of predators of the starfish
* Decline in predator populations through habitat destruction
* Warmer sea temperatures enhance larvae development
* Anthropogenic impacts, such as allochthonous nutrient input

Many of the reports of fish preying on &quot;Acanthaster&quot; are single observations or presumed predation from the nature of the fish. For example, the humphead wrasse may prey on the starfish amongst its more usual diet. Individual puffer fish and trigger fish have been observed to feed crown-of-thorns starfish in the Red Sea, but no evidence has found them to be a significant factor in population control. A study, however, based on the stomach contents of large carnivorous fish that are potential predators of the starfish, found no evidence of the starfish in the fish&#x27;s guts. These carnivorous fish were caught commercially on the coral reefs on the Gulf of Oman and examined at local fish markets.

One problem with the concept of predators of large juvenile and adult starfish causing total mortality is that the starfish have good regenerative powers and they would not keep still while being eaten. Also, they need to be consumed completely or almost completely to die; 17–60% of starfish in various populations had missing or regenerating arms. Clearly, the starfish experience various levels of sublethal predation. When the damage includes a major section of the disk together with arms, the number of arms regenerating on the disk may be less than the number lost.

Another hypothesis is the &quot;aggregation hypothesis&quot;, whereby large aggregations of &quot;A. planci&quot; appear as apparent outbreaks because they have consumed all the adjacent coral. This seems to imply that apparently a dense population outbreak exists when a more diffuse population outbreak has happened that has been dense enough to comprehensively prey on large areas of hard coral.

Female crown-of-thorns starfish are very fecund. Based on the eggs in ovaries, 200-, 300-. and 400-mm-diameter females potentially spawn around 4, 30, and 50 million eggs, respectively (see also Gametes and embryos). Lucas adopted a different approach, focusing on the survival of the larvae arising from the eggs. The rationale for this approach was that small changes in the survival of larvae and developmental stages would result in very large changes in the adult population, considering two hypothetical situations.

About 20 million eggs from a female spawning, having a survival rate around 0.00001% throughout development, would replace two adult starfish in a low-density population where the larvae recruit. If, however, the survival rate increases to 0.1% (one in a thousand) throughout development from one spawning of 20 million eggs, this would result in 20,000 adult starfish where the larvae have recruited. Since the larvae are the most abundant stages of development, changes in survival likely are of most importance during this phase of development.

Temperature and salinity have little effect on the survival of crown-of-thorns larvae. However, abundance and species of the particular component of phytoplankton (unicellular flagellates) on which the larvae feed has a profound effect on survival and rate of growth. The abundance of phytoplankton cells is especially important. As autotrophs, phytoplankton abundance is strongly influenced by the concentration of inorganic nutrients, such as nitrogenous compounds.

Birkeland had observed a correlation between the abundance of crown-of-thorns on reefs adjacent to land masses. These occurred on mainland islands as distinct from coral atolls about three years after heavy rainfall that followed a period of drought. He suggested that runoff from such heavy rainfall may stimulate phytoplankton blooms of sufficient size to produce enough food for the larvae of &quot;A. planci&quot; through input of nutrients.

Combining Birkeland observations with the influence of inorganic nutrients on survival of the starfish larvae in experimental studies gave support for a mechanism for starfish outbreaks:

increased terrestrial runoff → increased nutrients denser phytoplankton↑→ better larval survival → increased starfish populations

Further of these connections have been confirmed, but research by Olson (1987), Kaufmann (2002), and Byrne (2016) suggests terrestrial runoff has little or no impact on larval survival. The conflicting data describing the negligible role of terrestrial agricultural runoff have been described as &quot;an inconvenient study&quot;.

Also, a flow-on effect is seen in that where large starfish populations produce large numbers of larvae, heavy recruitment is likely on reefs downstream to which the larvae are carried and then settle.

==Population control==

Population numbers for the crown-of-thorns have been increasing since the 1970s. Historic records of distribution patterns and numbers, though, are hard to come by, as SCUBA technology, necessary to conduct population censuses, had only been developed in the previous few decades.

To prevent overpopulation of crown-of-thorns causing widespread destruction to coral reef habitats, humans have implemented a variety of control measures. Manual removals have been successful, but are relatively labour-intensive. Injecting sodium bisulfate into the starfish is the most efficient measure in practice. Sodium bisulfate is deadly to crown-of-thorns, but it does not harm the surrounding reef and oceanic ecosystems. To control areas of high infestations, teams of divers have had kill rates of up to 120 per hour per diver. The practice of dismembering them was shown to have a kill rate of 12 per hour per diver, and the diver performing this test was spiked three times. As a result, dismemberings are discouraged for this reason, and not because of rumours that they might be able to regenerate.

An even more labour-intensive route, but less risky to the diver, is to bury them under rocks or debris. This route is only suitable for areas with low infestation and if materials are available to perform the procedure without damaging corals.

A 2015 study by James Cook University showed that common household vinegar is also effective, as the acidity causes the starfish to disintegrate within days. Vinegar is also harmless to the environment, and is not restricted by regulations regarding animal products such as bile. In 2019, divers were using a 10% vinegar solution to reduce starfish populations in the Raja Ampat Islands.

A new successful method of population control is by the injection of thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (TCBS). Only one injection is needed, leading to starfish&#x27;s death in 24 hours from a contagious disease marked by &quot;discoloured and necrotic skin, ulcerations, loss of body turgor, accumulation of colourless mucus on many spines especially at their tip, and loss of spines. Blisters on the dorsal integument broke through the skin surface and resulted in large, open sores that exposed the internal organs.&quot;

An autonomous starfish-killing robot called COTSBot has been developed, and as of September 2015, was close to being ready for trials on the GBR. The COTSbot, which has a neural net-aided vision system, is designed to seek out crown-of-thorns starfish and give them a lethal injection of bile salts. After it eradicates the bulk of the starfish in a given area, human divers can move in and remove the survivors. Field trials of the robot have begun in Moreton Bay in Brisbane to refine its navigation system, according to Queensland University of Technology researcher Matthew Dunbabin. No crown-of-thorns starfish are in Moreton Bay, but when the navigation has been refined, the robot will be used on the reef.
There is research in Indonesia into the use of ground COTS remains as a fortifying additive to feed for whiteleg shrimp.

<doc id="607459" wikidata="Q1542610" url="?curid=607459" title="James River (Dakotas)">
<text>The James River (also known as the Jim River or the Dakota River) is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 710 miles (1,140 km) long, draining an area of 20,653 square miles (53,490 km2) in the U.S. states of North Dakota and South Dakota. About 70 percent of the drainage area is in South Dakota. The river provides the main drainage of the flat lowland area of the Dakotas between the two plateau regions known as the Missouri Coteau and the Coteau des Prairies. This narrow area was formed by the James lobe of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the last ice age, and as a consequence the watershed of the river is slender and it has few major tributaries for a river of its length.

The James drops approximately per , and this low gradient sometimes leads to reverse flow. Reverse flow occurs when high inflow from tributaries leads to James River water flowing upstream for several miles above the joining water. This happens most frequently north of Huron, South Dakota.

The river arises in Wells County, North Dakota, approximately 10 mi (16 km) northwest of Fessenden. It flows briefly east towards New Rockford, then generally SSE through eastern North Dakota, past Jamestown, where it is first impounded by a large reservoir (the Jamestown Dam), and then joined by the Pipestem River. It enters northeastern South Dakota in Brown County, where it is impounded to form two reservoirs northeast of Aberdeen.

At Columbia, it is joined by the Elm River. Flowing southward across eastern South Dakota, it passes Huron and Mitchell, where it is joined by the Firesteel Creek. South of Mitchell, it flows southeast and joins the Missouri just east of Yankton.

The James River flows fully across the state of South Dakota, the only river other than the Missouri to do so.

River conditions during normal years include still water on both the James and its tributaries as well as flooding. Floods occur after snowmelt or heavy rains, as water easily breaches the James&#x27; low banks, and such floods tend to cover a significant portion of the floodplain. When the river is still, water quality drops.

==History==
Originally called &quot;E-ta-zi-po-ka-se Wakpa&quot; (&quot;unnavigable river&quot;) in the Sioux language, the river was given the name &quot;Riviere aux Jacques&quot; in 1794 by Jean Trudeau, a French trader. This name was subsequently anglicized to James River, which was the name used by local English speakers at the time Dakota Territory was incorporated. However, the Dakota Territory Organic Act of 1861 renamed it the &quot;Dakota River&quot;. The new name failed to gain popular usage and the river retains its pre-1861 name.

<doc id="607464" wikidata="Q2994232" url="?curid=607464" title="Primordial soup">
<text>Primordial soup, also known as prebiotic soup and Haldane soup, is the hypothetical set of conditions present on the Earth around 3.7 to 4.0 billion years ago. It is an aspect of the heterotrophic theory (also known as the Oparin–Haldane hypothesis) concerning the origin of life, first proposed by Alexander Oparin in 1924, and J. B. S. Haldane in 1929.

As formulated by Oparin, in the primitive Earth&#x27;s surface layers, carbon, hydrogen, water vapour, and ammonia reacted to form the first organic compounds. The concept of a primordial soup gained credence in 1953 when the &quot;Miller–Urey experiment&quot; used a highly reduced mixture of gases—methane, ammonia and hydrogen—to form basic organic monomers, such as amino acids.

==Historical background ==
The notion that living beings originated from inanimate materials comes from the Ancient Greeks—the theory known as spontaneous generation. Aristotle in the 4th century BCE gave a proper explanation, writing:
Aristotle also states that it is not only that animals originate from other similar animals, but also that living things do arise and always have arisen from lifeless matter. His theory remained the dominant idea on origin of life (outside that of deity as a causal agent) from the ancient philosophers to the Renaissance thinkers in various forms. With the birth of modern science, experimental refutations emerged. Italian physician Francesco Redi demonstrated in 1668 that maggots developed from rotten meat only in a jar where flies could enter, but not in a closed-lid jar. He concluded that: &quot;omne vivum ex vivo&quot; (All life comes from life).

The experiment of French chemist Louis Pasteur in 1859 is regarded as the death blow to spontaneous generation. He experimentally showed that organisms (microbes) can not grow in sterilised water, unless it is exposed to air. The experiment won him the Alhumbert Prize in 1862 from the French Academy of Sciences, and he concluded: &quot;Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment.&quot;

Evolutionary biologists believed that a kind of spontaneous generation, but different from the simple Aristotelian doctrine, must have worked for the emergence of life. French biologist Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck had speculated that the first life form started from non-living materials. &quot;Nature, by means of heat, light, electricity and moisture&quot;, he wrote in 1809 in &quot;Philosophie Zoologique&quot; (&quot;The Philosophy of Zoology&quot;), &quot;forms direct or spontaneous generation at that extremity of each kingdom of living bodies, where the simplest of these bodies are found&quot;.

When English naturalist Charles Darwin introduced the theory of natural selection in his 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, his supporters, such as the German zoologist Ernst Haeckel, criticised him for not using his theory to explain the origin of life. Haeckel wrote in 1862: &quot;The chief defect of the Darwinian theory is that it throws no light on the origin of the primitive organism—probably a simple cell—from which all the others have descended. When Darwin assumes a special creative act for this first species, he is not consistent, and, I think, not quite sincere.&quot;

Although Darwin did not speak explicitly about the origin of life in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, he did mention a &quot;warm little pond&quot; in a letter to Joseph Dalton Hooker dated February 1, 1871:

===Heterotrophic theory===

A coherent scientific argument was introduced by Soviet biochemist Alexander Oparin in 1924. According to Oparin, in the primitive Earth&#x27;s surface, carbon, hydrogen, water vapour, and ammonia reacted to form the first organic compounds. Unbeknownst to Oparin, whose writing was circulated only in Russian, an English scientist J. B. S. Haldane independently arrived at a similar conclusion in 1929. It was Haldane who first used the term &quot;soup&quot; to describe the accumulation of organic material and water in the primitive Earth

According to the theory, organic compounds essential for life forms were synthesized in the primitive Earth under prebiotic conditions. The mixture of inorganic and organic compounds with water on the primitive Earth became the prebiotic or primordial soup. There, life originated and the first forms of life were able to use the organic molecules to survive and reproduce. Today the theory is variously known as the heterotrophic theory, heterotrophic origin of life theory, or the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. Biochemist Robert Shapiro has summarized the basic points of the theory in its &quot;mature form&quot; as follows:

# Early Earth had a chemically reducing atmosphere.
# This atmosphere, exposed to energy in various forms, produced simple organic compounds (&quot;monomers&quot;).

==Oparin&#x27;s theory==

Alexander Oparin first postulated his theory in Russia in 1924 in a small pamphlet titled &quot;Proiskhozhdenie Zhizny &quot;(&quot;The Origin of Life&quot;). According to Oparin, the primitive Earth&#x27;s surface had a thick red-hot liquid, composed of heavy elements such as carbon (in the form of iron carbide). This nucleus was surrounded by the lightest elements, i.e. gases, such as hydrogen. In the presence of water vapour, carbides reacted with hydrogen to form hydrocarbons. Such hydrocarbons were the first organic molecules. These further combined with oxygen and ammonia to produce hydroxy- and amino-derivatives, such as carbohydrates and proteins. These molecules accumulated on the ocean&#x27;s surface, becoming gel-like substances and growing in size. They gave rise to primitive organisms (cells), which he called coacervates. In his original theory, Oparin considered oxygen as one of the primordial gases; thus the primordial atmosphere was an oxidising one. However, when he elaborated his theory in 1936 (in a book by the same title, and translated into English in 1938), he modified the chemical composition of the primordial environment as strictly reducing, consisting of methane, ammonia, free hydrogen and water vapour—excluding oxygen.

In his 1936 work, impregnated by a Darwinian thought that involved a slow and gradual evolution from the simple to the complex, Oparin proposed a heterotrophic origin, result of a long process of chemical and pre-biological evolution, where the first forms of life should have been microorganisms dependent on the molecules and organic substances present in their external environment. That external environment was the primordial soup.

The idea of a heterotrophic origin was based, in part, on the universality of fermentative reactions, which, according to Oparin, should have first appeared in evolution due to its simplicity. This was opposed to the idea, widely accepted at that time, that the first organisms emerged endowed with an autotrophic metabolism, which included photosynthetic pigments, enzymes and the ability to synthesize organic compounds from CO2 and H2O; for Oparin it was impossible to reconcile the original photosynthetic organisms with the ideas of Darwinian evolution.

From the detailed analysis of the geochemical and astronomical data known at that date, Oparin also proposed a primitive atmosphere devoid of O2 and composed of CH4, NH3 and H2O; under these conditions it was pointed out that the origin of life had been preceded by a period of abiotic synthesis and subsequent accumulation of various organic compounds in the seas of primitive Earth. This accumulation resulted in the formation of a primordial broth containing a wide variety of molecules.

There, according to Oparin, a particular type of colloid, the coacervates, were formed due to the conglomeration of organic molecules and other polymers with positive and negative charges. Oparin suggested that the first living beings had been preceded by pre-cellular structures similar to those coacervates, whose gradual evolution gave rise to the appearance of the first organisms.

Like the coacervates, several of Oparin&#x27;s original ideas have been reformulated and replaced; this includes, for example, the reducing character of the atmosphere on primitive Earth, the coacervates as a pre-cellular model and the primitive nature of glycolysis. In the same way, we now understand that the gradual processes are not necessarily slow, and we even know, thanks to the fossil record, that the origin and early evolution of life occurred in short geologic time lapses.

However, the general approach of Oparin&#x27;s theory had great implications for biology, since his work achieved the transformation of the study of the origin of life from a purely speculative field to a structured and broad research program. Thus, since the second half of the twentieth century, Oparin&#x27;s theory of the origin and early evolution of life has undergone a restructuring that accommodates the experimental findings of molecular biology, as well as the theoretical contributions of evolutionary biology.

A point of convergence between these two branches of biology and that has been perfectly incorporated into the heterotrophic origin theory is found in the RNA world hypothesis.

This links to the Soda Ocean Hypothesis, characterizing the primitive ocean with a higher carbonate mineral supersaturation.
Soda lakes are considered as environments that conserve and/or mimic ancient life conditions 
and as &quot;a recreated model of late Precambrian ocean chemistry&quot; — that is, the &quot;soda lake&quot; environment that prepared the great explosion of life during the Cambrian.

==Haldane&#x27;s theory==

J.B.S. Haldane independently postulated his primordial soup theory in 1929 in an eight-page article &quot;The origin of life&quot; in &quot;The Rationalist Annual&quot;. According to Haldane the primitive Earth&#x27;s atmosphere was essentially reducing, with little or no oxygen. Ultraviolet rays from the Sun induced reactions on a mixture of water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia. Organic substances such as sugars and protein components (amino acids) were synthesised. These molecules &quot;accumulated till the primitive oceans reached the consistency of hot dilute soup.&quot; The first reproducing things were created from this soup.

As to the priority over the theory, Haldane accepted that Oparin came first, saying, &quot;I have very little doubt that Professor Oparin has the priority over me.&quot;

==Monomer formation==

One of the most important pieces of experimental support for the &quot;soup&quot; theory came in 1953. A graduate student, Stanley Miller, and his professor, Harold Urey, performed an experiment that demonstrated how organic molecules could have spontaneously formed from inorganic precursors, under conditions like those posited by the Oparin–Haldane hypothesis. The now-famous &quot;Miller–Urey experiment&quot; used a highly reduced mixture of gases—methane, ammonia and hydrogen—to form basic organic monomers, such as amino acids. This provided direct experimental support for the second point of the &quot;soup&quot; theory, and it is one of the remaining two points of the theory that much of the debate now centers.

Apart from the Miller–Urey experiment, the next most important step in research on prebiotic organic synthesis was the demonstration by Joan Oró that the nucleic acid purine base, adenine, was formed by heating aqueous ammonium cyanide solutions. In support of abiogenesis in eutectic ice, more recent work demonstrated the formation of s-triazines (alternative nucleobases), pyrimidines (including cytosine and uracil), and adenine from urea solutions subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under a reductive atmosphere (with spark discharges as an energy source).

==The Darwinian dynamic==

The evolution of living systems by natural selection that presumably emerged in the primordial soup, and certain nonliving physical order-generating systems, were proposed to obey a common fundamental principle that was termed the Darwinian dynamic. The basic conditions necessary for natural selection to operate as conceived by Darwin are variation of type, heritability and competition for limited resources. These conditions can apply to short replicating RNA molecules that were presumably present in the primordial soup, and such RNA molecules have been proposed to have preceded the emergence of more complex life (see RNA world). The basic processes of natural selection applicable to short replicating RNA molecules were shown to have the same form and content as equations that govern the emergence of macroscopic order in nonliving systems maintained far from thermodynamic equilibrium. However, currently, the extent to which Darwinian principles apply to the presumed prebiotic and protocellular phases of life, as well as to non-biological systems, remains an unresolved issue in efforts to understand the emergence of life.

<doc id="607470" wikidata="Q799856" url="?curid=607470" title="Bagasse">
<text>Bagasse ( ) is the dry pulpy fibrous material that remains after crushing sugarcane or sorghum stalks to extract their juice. It is used as a biofuel for the production of heat, energy, and electricity, and in the manufacture of pulp and building materials. Agave bagasse is similar, but is the material remnants after extracting blue agave sap.

==Etymology==

The word comes from &quot;bagasse&quot; (French) and &quot;bagazo&quot; (Spanish), meaning &quot;refuse&quot; or &quot;trash&quot;. It originally referred to the material left after pressing olives, palm nuts, and grapes. The word eventually came to be used in the context of processing of plants such as sugarcane and sugar beets. Today, it usually refers to by-products of the sugarcane mill.

==Description==
Bagasse is the solid by-product when the liquid components are extracted from plants. Much of the core of those plants is a heterogeneous &quot;pith&quot; fibre. This fibre is primarily parenchyma tissue, along with bast, rind, or stem fibers of the sclerenchyma.

Here&#x27;s an example chemical analysis of washed and dried bagasse:

*Cellulose: 45–55%
*Hemicellulose: 20–25%

==Production==
For every 10 tonnes of sugarcane crushed, a sugar factory produces nearly three tonnes of wet bagasse. It is challenging to use this byproduct directly as a fuel because of the high moisture content, typically 40–50 percent. Instead, bagasse is typically stored prior to further processing.

For electricity production, the bagasse is stored under moist conditions. Under these conditions, the bagasse undergoes a mild exothermic process as the residual sugars slightly degrade.

For paper and pulp production, the bagasse is normally stored wet so as to facilitate the subsequent removal of any remaining sugar as well as the short pith fibres. These fibres would impede the paper making process.

==Uses==
Numerous research efforts have explored using bagasse in the production of bio-based materials and as a biofuel in renewable power generation.

===Biochar===

Sugarcane bagasse biomass (SB) has the potential to be transformed into energy, materials and chemicals.

===Fuel===
Sugar mills often use bagasse as a primary fuel source. When burned in quantity, bagasse produces enough heat energy to fully power a typical sugar mill, with some energy to spare. Cogeneration is a common setup, with this extra energy sold to the consumer electrical grid. Historically, bagasse was also used to fuel steam locomotives that brought the cut cane to the mills.

The CO2 emissions from burning the bagasse in a sugarcane plant is less than the amount of CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere when the sugarcane grows, which could make the process carbon-neutral or better. In contrast, a study in the &quot;International Journal of Global Warming&quot; warned that electricity generation with bagasse would never be fully carbon-free but did represent a large reduction in carbon emissions compared to the use of diesel. In countries such as Australia, sugar factories contribute this &quot;green&quot; power to the electricity grid. Hawaiian Electric Industries also burns bagasse for cogeneration.

Ethanol produced from the sugar is a popular fuel in Brazil. The cellulose-rich bagasse is also being investigated for its potential in producing commercial quantities of cellulosic ethanol. For example, until May 2015, BP operated a cellulosic ethanol demonstration plant in Jennings, Louisiana.

In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China, bagasse is sometimes used to smoke bacon and sausages.

===Feedstock===
Bagasse from sugarcane production offers an attractive feedstock for the production of biofuel and value-added products as it does not affect food security. Second generation biohydrogen, biomethane, biomethanol, or bioethanol through the biochemical route is considered to not only be an eco-friendly, but also economically feasible option. Thermochemical production pathways, such as hydrothermal liquefaction, pyrolysis and gasification of bagasse are a promising alternative to produce advanced 2G biofuels (e.g. jet fuel and Diesel) and chemicals (e.g. for plastics) with low life cycle impacts.

===Pulp, paper, board and packaging===
In many tropical and subtropical countries such as India, China, Colombia, Iran, Thailand, and Argentina, bagasse is commonly used instead of wood in the production of pulp, paper and board. This substitution produces pulp with physical properties that are well suited for printing and notebook paper, tissue products, boxes, and newspapers. It can also be used for making boards resembling plywood or particle board, known called bagasse boards and Xanita boards. These are widely used in the production of partitions and furniture.

The industrial steps to convert bagasse into paper was developed in 1937 at a small laboratory in Hacienda Paramonga, a sugar mill on the coast of Peru owned by the W.R. Grace Company. Using a promising method invented by Clarence Birdseye, the company bought an old paper mill in Whippany, New Jersey and shipped bagasse from Peru there to test the viability of the process on an industrial scale. The first bagasse paper manufacturing machines were designed in Germany and installed in the Cartavio sugar cane plant in 1938.

On January 26–27, 1950, the Noble &amp; Wood Machine Company, the Kinsley Chemical Company, and the Chemical Paper Company jointly demonstrated the first successful commercial production of newsprint produced from bagasse at Chemical Paper&#x27;s mills in Holyoke. The process&#x27;s first use was in the printing of a special edition of the &quot;Holyoke Transcript-Telegram&quot;. This demonstration was done in collaboration with the governments of Puerto Rico and Argentina due to the economic importance of the product in countries without ready access to wood fibers. The work was presented before representatives of 100 industrial interests and officials from 15 countries.

Bagasse has become a popular materials choice for tableware packaging. The material is suitable for both cold and hot applications (up to ~120 °C). Additionally, it can be put in the freezer and microwave without problems. It also has reasonably good water- and grease resistance, which can be enhanced by chemical modification. 

Historically, PFOA and related fluorinated materials were commonly used to increase heat, water and grease resistance. However, the use of these have now been banned. Other means of enhancing the material properties of bagasse are mixing with gelatin, starch or agar.

=== Nanocellulose ===
Nanocellulose, a higher-value product, can be produced from bagasse through various conventional and novel processes.

==Health impact==
Workplace exposure to dust from the processing of bagasse can cause bagassosis, a subtype of the chronic lung condition pulmonary fibrosis.

===Human consumption===

Sugarcane fiber, a variety of processed bagasse, is sometimes added to human food. It is a soluble fiber that can help promote intestinal regularity. One animal study suggests that sugarcane fiber combined with a high-fat diet may help control type 2 diabetes. It is a good source of lignoceric and cerotic acids.

<text>Highway 4 is the longest east–west main vehicle route on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, with a total length of . It is known locally as the &quot;Alberni Highway&quot; to the east of Port Alberni and the &quot;Pacific Rim Highway&quot; to the west. The original highway from Parksville to Alberni and Port Alberni was completed in 1942 and was originally designated as Highway 1A. It was re-designated as Highway 4 in 1953, and was extended in 1961 to the district of Tofino, on the west coast of the Island.

==Route details==

Highway 4&#x27;s eastern terminus is at the interchange with Highway 19 at Qualicum Beach; however, the roadway continues north as &quot;Memorial Avenue&quot; for to Highway 19A. From Highway 19, it travels south for to a junction with an older Alberni Highway segment, now known as Highway 4A, at the small community of Hilliers in Coombs. Highway 4 veers directly west upon meeting this junction.

The majority of Highway 4&#x27;s length is composed of a two-lane configuration. An inactive subdivision of the E&amp;N Railway parallels Highway 4 all the way from the coast near Parksville to the city of Port Alberni.

West of Coombs Junction, Highway 4 travels for before meeting Cameron Lake. Highway 4 hugs the shore of Cameron Lake for , then winds its way through MacMillan Provincial Park, which includes a tourist attraction known as Cathedral Grove. After Cameron Lake, Highway 4 climbs for , following the Cameron River, to the Port Alberni Summit—the highest point on the highway (elevation: ), known by locals as &quot;The Hump&quot;, at which it crosses from the Regional District of Nanaimo into the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District—and then descends for to a spur that travels into the city centre of Port Alberni. Highway 4 enters the city limits of Port Alberni west of the main spur into the city, and later, exits Port Alberni via a bridge over the Somass River.
 west of the Somass River crossing, Highway 4 reaches the shore of Sproat Lake, following the lake shore west for . Highway 4 then follows the Taylor River for to the summit of Sutton Pass (elevation: ), named after William John Sutton, and then turns toward the south-southwest to follow the Kennedy River. This winding bearing of Highway 4, which features very steep grades, continues for before reaching the southeast shore of Kennedy Lake. Highway 4 then follows the shore of Kennedy Lake southwest for , and reaches a junction with a spur into the district municipality of Ucluelet (known locally as &quot;The Junction&quot;) later, after which the route continues in a northwest direction. later, Highway 4 enters the Long Beach Unit of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve. Highway 4 goes through the national park for northwest before terminating later at Tofino.
==Major intersections==
From east to west:




==Highway 4A==
Highway 4A is the previous alignment of Highway 4 east of Coombs. The &#x27;4A&#x27; designation was originally assigned in 1968 to the current section of Highway 4 between Coombs and Qualicum Beach. The 4 and 4A alignments east and north of Coombs, respectively, switched designations when the Parksville to Mud Bay section of the Inland Island Highway was completed in 1996. This older spur of Highway 4 terminates in the east at Parksville, from Coombs.

<text>Northfield Mount Hermon School (abbreviated as NMH), is a co-educational college-preparatory school in Gill, Massachusetts. It educates boarding and day students in grades 9–12, as well as post-graduate students. It is a member of the Eight Schools Association.

== History ==
=== Egalitarian origins ===
In 1879, Northfield, Massachusetts native Dwight Lyman Moody (1837–99) established the Northfield Seminary for Young Ladies (renamed to the Northfield School for Girls in 1944) in his hometown. Two years later, he established a brother school, the Mount Hermon School for Boys, across the Connecticut River in Gill, Massachusetts. The schools were consolidated into a single non-profit corporation in 1912, but operated separately until 1971.

Moody initially envisioned the schools as a source of terminal education; in the early days, some of the students were in their thirties. The schools offered separate programs of study to accommodate their student body&#x27;s varying goals. Each offered a college-preparatory course and a technical course. For a while, Mount Hermon also offered courses in agriculture and for future ministers. In the early days, most Mount Hermon students enrolled in the ministerial program, whose curriculum was designed to be sufficiently rigorous that a graduate could &quot;enter the ministry or a related field without further formal education.&quot;

An Evangelical preacher, D. L. Moody sought &quot;to provide a Christian education for [students] of high purpose and limited means.&quot; The schools charged low tuition ($100/year in 1881) compared to other boarding schools and relied heavily on donations from Moody&#x27;s followers. Through the 1920s, the rule was that &quot;[n]o student was accepted if he could afford the fees of more expensive schools&quot;; as a result, the students were &quot;drawn largely from families at or near the poverty line,&quot; and as late as 1914, a majority of male students at Mount Hermon had previously worked in an occupation or trade. In 1903 two-fifths of Northfield students did not live within commuting distance of a high school. Students would attend, drop out, and return based on the family&#x27;s economic needs back home. In 1903, the schools reportedly enrolled 1,200 students and received at least four applicants for every vacancy.

On campus, the schools tended to provide a &quot;community life of minimum expenditure.&quot; The schools operated a campus farm, and all students (both boys and girls) were required to perform some kind of labor to help fund the school&#x27;s operations. Today, each student is still required to hold a job on campus, working three hours a week.

=== Evolution to nonsectarian college-preparatory school ===

In the 1920s and 1930s, the Northfield schools shifted to a more conventional college-preparatory boarding school model. Enrollment remained high; by 1930, the schools&#x27; combined enrollment made the institution the largest private secondary school in the United States. Mount Hermon&#x27;s ministerial curriculum was eliminated, and although a minority of Mount Hermon graduates went on to college during the Moody years, by the 1940s &quot;virtually all [Mount Hermon boys] did so,&quot; as did half the girls at Northfield.

During the Great Depression, many Americans proved unable to pay even the Northfield schools&#x27; relatively low tuition fees. As such, the schools began accepting wealthy students in the 1930s. Tuition increased from $324 in 1929 to $2,600 by 1963, quadrupling in real terms. Nonetheless, the schools still educated large numbers of working- and middle-class students; in 1963, the school announced that it would double its financial aid budget, putting 60% of students on scholarship. The cost of providing a college-preparatory education has increased over time, and the school&#x27;s reliance on wealthy students has increased accordingly. The percentage of scholarship students halved from 1963 to 2015.

The schools&#x27; ties to Evangelical Christianity weakened amidst the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy, and the schools eventually shifted to &quot;a more liberal brand of Protestantism.&quot; Compulsory attendance at most Sunday chapel services was abolished in 1970.

=== Ethnic and regional diversity ===
Northfield Mount Hermon has a long tradition of educating minority and international students. (D. L. Moody was harshly criticized for his failure to oppose the emerging segregation movement when visiting the South in 1876; he founded Northfield Seminary three years later.)

As late as 1950, the Northfield schools were two of a handful of New England boarding schools admitting African-American students. One of Mount Hermon&#x27;s first graduates, Thomas Nelson Baker Sr., was a freed slave who became the first African-American to obtain a PhD in philosophy in the United States. Several notable black lawyers attended the Northfield schools in the 1940s and 1950s, including judges William C. Pryor and Anna Diggs Taylor and civil rights attorney James Nabrit III, who argued (and won) &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot;. In 1963 Mount Hermon&#x27;s president pioneered a program to prepare black students to attend private schools, which developed into the A Better Chance program.

Sixteen of Northfield Seminary&#x27;s first 100 students were Native Americans. In an era where the U.S. government sought to relocate Native Americans to federal boarding schools, Moody sought to train Native teachers who would return to their communities and open local schools. At Mount Hermon&#x27;s first commencement in 1887, one student addressed the audience &quot;in his native language, for the representatives of the Sioux, Shawnee, and Alaskan tribes in the school.&quot; Henry Roe Cloud, class of 1906, was the first Native American to graduate from Yale. The Athabascan Walter Harper attended the school in the 1900s after becoming the first man to summit Denali. In the 1970s and 1980s, the school educated two of &quot;the first Navajos to matriculate at Princeton.&quot;

The Northfield schools were also reputed for their openness to international students, many of whom were referred to the schools by American missionaries. They have educated students from Asia since at least 1886; and Chan Loon Teung, class of 1892, was Harvard&#x27;s first Chinese graduate. Pixley Seme, the founder and president of the African National Congress, graduated from NMH in 1902. In 1889 Mount Hermon enrolled 37 international students from 15 countries, mostly Canada and the British Isles; 3 students came from East Asia, 3 from Turkey, and 1 from Africa. In 1904 it enrolled 113 international students from 27 countries, including 14 from Asia.

=== 21st-century downsizing and reorientation ===

From 2004 to 2005, NMH closed its Northfield campus and announced that it would halve its enrollment. The school explained that it wanted to reduce its high operating costs, including faculty salaries and the expenses of running two campuses. It sold Northfield&#x27;s academic core in 2009 and the surrounding grounds in 2016. Since 2019, Northfield has hosted a satellite campus of California-based Catholic liberal arts college Thomas Aquinas College.

Since the downsizing, NMH&#x27;s faculty and student body have shrunk, but the share of students on financial aid has not increased. In 2003, NMH educated 1,124 students, 42% of whom were on financial aid. In the 2023–24 school year, the school enrolled 630 students, 37% of whom were on financial aid. The student-teacher ratio remained constant at 6:1. In the 2023–24 school year, 23% of the student body came from abroad, and 33% of the American students (25.4% of the student body) identified as people of color.

NMH is currently conducting a fundraising campaign which aims to raise $275 million, including $75 million for financial aid, $25 million for faculty salaries, and $70 million for facility improvements. The campaign was supported by the largest gift in school history, from a former Mount Hermon valedictorian and scholarship student.

The school was a major filming location for Alexander Payne&#x27;s 2023 film &quot;The Holdovers&quot;, standing in for the fictional Barton Academy.

== Tuition ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
In the 2023–24 school year, NMH charged boarding students $72,647 and day students $48,302, plus other mandatory and optional fees. International students were charged an additional $3,345.

37% of the student body is on financial aid, which covers, on average, $56,314 (77.5% of tuition) for boarding students and $34,361 (71.1% of tuition) for day students. The school commits to meet 100% of an admitted student&#x27;s demonstrated financial need.

=== Endowment and expenses ===
NMH&#x27;s financial endowment stood at $185.9 million as of June 30, 2023. In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2021–22 school year, NMH reported total assets of $311.8 million, net assets of $212.4 million, investment holdings of $178.0 million, and cash holdings of $23.3 million. NMH also reported $36.7 million in program service expenses and $9.1 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

== Athletics ==
NMH has one of the strongest athletic programs in New England. Notable teams include boys&#x27; basketball (2013 national title, 4 New England titles), boys&#x27; cross country (27 New England titles), track and field (8 New England titles), boys&#x27; soccer (7 New England titles, the most of any school), girls&#x27; volleyball (7 New England titles), girls&#x27; basketball (5 New England titles), wrestling (5 New England titles), and girls&#x27; alpine skiing (3 New England titles).

In recent years, NMH&#x27;s postgraduate program has become a popular option for students seeking to bolster their academic and athletic resumes before applying to college. In 2014, the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; wrote that NMH &quot;has become the standard layover destination for [postgraduate basketball] players in the Ivy League.&quot; (The previous year, 47.7% of Ivy League men&#x27;s basketball players had prep school experience.) According to the NMH website, &quot;[o]ver the past 15 years, NMH has sent 45 players to the Ivy League, which is more than 3x the amount of any other program.&quot;

In February 2024, the school announced plans to build a new hockey rink (to open in 2025-26) and to convert its existing hockey rink into a new set of basketball and tennis courts (to open in 2026). The project is estimated to cost $20 million.

William G. Morgan, the inventor of volleyball, graduated from Mount Hermon in 1893. NMH also claims to have invented the sport of Ultimate Frisbee in 1968.

==Arts programs==

The Rhodes Arts Center houses a concert hall, a black-box theater, and art and music rehearsal spaces and practice rooms.

Memorial Chapel houses a 2-manual 27-stop, 37-rank tracker organ with a pedal compass of 30, and a manual compass of 56.

<doc id="607489" wikidata="Q295781" url="?curid=607489" title="Nikolai Podgorny">
<text>Nikolai Viktorovich Podgorny ( – 12 January 1983) was a Soviet statesman who served as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the head of state of the Soviet Union, from 1965 to 1977.

Podgorny was born to a Ukrainian working-class family in the city of Karlovka on 18 February 1903. He later graduated from a local worker&#x27;s school in 1926 before completing his education at the Kiev Technological Institute of Food Industry in 1931. In 1930, Podgorny became a member of the ruling Communist Party of the Soviet Union and climbed up the Soviet hierarchy after years of service to the country&#x27;s centrally planned economy. By 1953, Podgorny became Second Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine in 1953 before later serving as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine from 1957 to 1963.

In October 1964, Podgorny participated in a coup replacing Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Thereafter, as a member of the collective leadership, Podgorny formed an unofficial Triumvirate (also known by its Russian name &quot;Troika&quot;) alongside Premier Alexei Kosygin and General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. On 6 December 1965, he replaced Anastas Mikoyan as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. After Kosygin&#x27;s standing was damaged in the wake of the Prague Spring crisis in 1968, Podgorny emerged as the second-most powerful figure in the country behind Brezhnev. Thereafter, his influence over policy declined as Brezhnev consolidated his control over the regime. By June 1977, he was removed as Chairman of the Presidium as well as a member of the Politburo. Upon his removal from the Soviet leadership, Podgorny was forced to resign from active politics and sidelined in Soviet affairs until his death in 1983.

==Early life==
Nikolai Viktorovich Podgorny was born on in Karlovka, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), to a Ukrainian working-class family. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Podgorny became one of the founders of the Karlovka branch of the Komsomol, and served as a Secretary of the Komsomol from 1921 to 1923. Podgorny started work at the age of 17 as a student at the mechanical workshops in Karlovka. In 1926, Podgorny graduated from a local workers&#x27; school. In 1930, Podgorny became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the ruling party of the Soviet Union.

In 1931, Podgorny graduated from the Kiev Technological Institute of Food Industry and started working in the sugar industry. Podgorny was promoted to deputy chief engineer of Vinnytsia in 1937 and was promoted in 1939 as the chief engineer of the Kamenetz-Podolsk Oblast sugar trusts. By the end of 1939, Podgorny had become Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Food Industry of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Ukrainian SSR). The next year, Podgorny was appointed Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Food Industry of the Soviet Union.

==Rise to the Soviet leadership (1942–1964)==
Podgorny became the Director of the Moscow Technological Institute of Food Industry in 1942 during World War II. After the liberation of Ukraine from Nazi Germany, Podgorny reestablished Soviet control over Ukraine on the orders of the Ukrainian SSR and the Soviet Government. In the post-war years, Podgorny regained his old office of Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Food Industry of the Ukrainian SSR, but was later appointed in 1946 as a Permanent Representative to the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR. In April 1950, he was made First Secretary of the Kharkiv Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU). In 1953, Podgorny was elevated to Second Secretary of the Central Committee (CC) of the CPU. From 1957 to 1963, Podgorny was First Secretary of the CC of the CPU, effectively the most powerful position in Ukraine. In this role, Podgorny worked on reorganising and modernising the Ukrainian economy, which had been destroyed during the war years. He worked to increase the rate of industrial and agricultural production and to improve people&#x27;s welfare. He paid particular attention to improving party organisation and educating new cadres.

In 1960, Podgorny became a member of the Politburo (Political Bureau), the highest policy-making authority in the Soviet Union. By 1963, Podgorny had risen to prominence within the Soviet hierarchy as a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). As a protégé and close companion of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, he travelled with him to the United Nations headquarters in 1960. Podgorny acted as a Soviet emissary to Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Canada, and Yugoslavia. Podgorny&#x27;s beliefs were strongly influenced by Khrushchev, and under Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s rule, Podgorny was one of the most liberal members within the Soviet leadership, even more liberal than Premier Alexei Kosygin.

Podgorny briefly fell out of Khruschev&#x27;s favor in 1961 when he blamed bad corn yields in the Ukrainian SSR on &quot;bad weather&quot;, while Khrushchev claimed the crops had been &quot;stolen&quot; and &quot;pilfered&quot;. However, in 1962, Podgorny reported to Khrushchev that agricultural output had again increased: Under Podgorny&#x27;s leadership, the Ukrainian SSR had doubled Ukraine&#x27;s supply of grain to the state from the previous year. Because of his handling of agriculture, First World commentators saw Podgorny as one of Khrushchev&#x27;s many potential heirs.

According to historian Ilya Zemtsov, the author of &quot;Chernenko: The Last Bolshevik: The Soviet Union on the Eve of Perestroika&quot;, Brezhnev began starting a conspiracy against Khrushchev when he found out that he had chosen Podgorny, and not himself, as his potential successor. During the 1964 ouster to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary and Premier, Podgorny and Brezhnev appealed to the Central Committee, blaming Khrushchev for economic failures and accusing him of voluntarism and immodest behaviour. Influenced by Brezhnev and his allies, Politburo members voted to remove Khrushchev from office.

==Post-Khrushchev troika (1964–1977)==
===Struggle for power===
In the aftermath of Khrushchev&#x27;s removal, a collective leadership known as a &quot;troika&quot; was formed, headed by Brezhnev as First Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as head of government, and Anastas Mikoyan as head of state.
Before becoming head of state, Podgorny served as the party&#x27;s Second Secretary, and was therefore in charge of the Party&#x27;s Organisational Division. In this capacity, Podgorny threatened Brezhnev&#x27;s position as First Secretary because the Organisational Division, if Podgorny chose so, could easily be turned into his own power base within the party. Due to this risk, Brezhnev allied himself with Alexander Shelepin, the KGB chairman, to oppose both Podgorny and Kosygin.

Podgorny&#x27;s position was constantly threatened by Brezhnev and his allies. In an article in &quot;Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta&quot; from February 1965, the newspaper criticised the Kharkiv Party organisation which Podgorny had previously headed, but also its management of the economy. By indirectly criticising Podgorny, the article raised doubts about his qualifications as a leading member of the Soviet leadership. Podgorny launched a counterattack in his 1965 speech in Baku, Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic, where he criticised the Soviet leadership&#x27;s heavy industrial policy. This, as it turned out, would be a move he would regret for life. Instead of offending just Brezhnev and Shelepin, he offended the whole conservative wing of the leadership. To make matters even worse for Podgorny, Mikhail Suslov, who had kept outside of the conflict, sided with Brezhnev, and called his views &quot;revisionist&quot;. Later in December 1965, Podgorny relinquished his seat in the Secretariat, and took Mikoyan&#x27;s place as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. According to Ilya Zemstov, his departure from the Secretariat signaled the end of his wish to assume the First Secretaryship.
The majority of Politburo members under Brezhnev were conservative communists. Even so, Podgorny remained one of the most liberal-minded members in the Era of Stagnation. Other liberal-minded Politburo members included Kosygin and Andrei Kirilenko. Factionalism within the Soviet leadership in the 1960s led Podgorny to become more active; he held several speeches in Moscow and went on numerous state visits at the expense of Brezhnev and Kosygin&#x27;s popularity. There was speculation in Soviet society that Podgorny was trying to replace Kosygin as Premier, or even Brezhnev as General Secretary, due to his increasing presence in the late 1960s.

In 1971, the 24th Party Congress affirmed Brezhnev&#x27;s and Kosygin&#x27;s status as the leadership&#x27;s current highest-ranking figures but Podgorny nevertheless showed that he remained a major player in Soviet politics by leading delegations to China and North Vietnam later that year. As Brezhnev adopted more liberal positions, Podgorny attracted support among hardline communists by opposing his conciliatory stance towards Yugoslavia, disarmament deals with the West, and pressuring of East Germany into conceding to the Berlin negotiations. In the Politburo, Podgorny could count on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Additionally, when Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, such an opportunity was often ignored due to how frequently Podgorny found himself in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues. Ultimately, the collective leadership was rendered powerless in the late 1970s when Brezhnev achieved all but complete control over the Politburo.

===Diplomatic protocol as head of state===

In 1967, just before the outbreak of the Six-Day War, Podgorny delivered an intelligence report to Egyptian Vice President Anwar Sadat which claimed, falsely, that Israeli troops were massing along the Syrian border. In 1971 Podgorny went on two state visits, the first to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the second to North Vietnam; Kosygin went on a visit to Canada while Brezhnev visited Yugoslavia. Podgorny frequently paid visits to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War to discuss Soviet-Vietnamese foreign relations. In 1973, Podgorny visited Finland and Mohammad Daoud Khan&#x27;s Afghanistan.

Brezhnev conspired to oust Podgorny as early as 1970. The reason was simple: Brezhnev was third, while Podgorny was first in the ranking of Soviet diplomatic protocol. Since September 1970 Brezhnev tried to form an opposition in the Politburo to oust Podgorny. According to &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;There was some speculation in Moscow&quot; that if Brezhnev did not succeed in removing Podgorny he would establish a Council of State modelled after institutions found in, for example, East Germany, the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria and the Socialist Republic of Romania. The post of Chairman of the Council of State would give Brezhnev the top state and party job in the USSR. Brezhnev&#x27;s backers were unable, and did not even try, to remove Podgorny from the head of state post at the 1970 Central Committee plenum. Brezhnev could count on only five votes, while another seven Politburo members were opposed to granting Brezhnev more power. Under such circumstances, removing Podgorny would be condemned among the Soviet elite for violating the principle of collective leadership.

===Later tenure===
In the early 1970s, Brezhnev strengthened Podgorny&#x27;s position at the expense of Premier Kosygin by giving the Presidium executive powers. As a result of these changes, the post of Chairman of the Presidium changed from a largely honorary office to the second most important office in the USSR. Pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called for the expansion of Party activities in the Soviets.

Unbeknownst to Podgorny, Brezhnev felt threatened by his new authority and ordered Konstantin Chernenko to review the 1936 Soviet Constitution for a way to weaken Podgorny&#x27;s position. As it turned out there were none under current Soviet law. As the head of state, Podgorny could block any measures taken by Brezhnev to circumscribe his powers. Chernenko&#x27;s solution to this dilemma was to make it law that the Party leader could also become the Chairman of the Presidium. Consequently, a new constitution was drafted to include such a provision. On 7 October 1977, the 1977 Soviet Constitution which affirmed the Party&#x27;s supremacy in Soviet society was approved by the Soviet leadership. The approval of the 1977 Soviet Constitution is considered Podgorny&#x27;s death knell.

===Removal===
Podgorny&#x27;s removal from office in 1977 has become the most notable example of power transfer in the late Brezhnev Era. According to Robert Vincent Daniels, Podgorny was, before his removal, the second most powerful man in the Soviet Union, behind Brezhnev but ahead of Premier Kosygin. Though there were some Sovietologists who foresaw Podgorny&#x27;s fall, the decision to remove Podgorny from the Politburo took the world by surprise. On 24 May 1977, a unanimous vote was taken by the Central Committee after Grigory Romanov proposed removing Podgorny from the Politburo. The vote seemed to have taken Podgorny by surprise, and immediately after the vote, he got up from his politburo seat to instead sit with the ordinary members. Podgorny was nominally still Chairman of the Presidium, but his leadership had ended. After his removal from the Politburo Podgorny&#x27;s name disappeared from Soviet media. The Soviet media told the Soviet people that he had retired due to his stance against détente and producing more consumer goods. Twenty-three days after his removal from the Politburo, Podgorny lost his Chairmanship of the Presidium on 16 June 1977.

Due to his advanced age, Brezhnev was regarded as too old to carry out some of the functions of head of state. The Supreme Soviet, on Brezhnev&#x27;s orders, established the new post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, an office equivalent to the post of Vice President. Vasili Kuznetsov, at the age of 76, was unanimously approved by the Supreme Soviet as First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium.

==Retirement, death and recognition==

Podgorny&#x27;s life after his resignation is not well documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There was never any explanation given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace of the Kremlin in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked embarrassed by the presence of Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet. In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitry Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer in Kiev on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

As with many other high-standing Soviet officials, Podgorny was honoured with several awards. He was awarded five Orders of Lenin, one Order of the Red Banner and several medals, as well as being awarded several foreign state prizes by Bangladesh, the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, and Finland.

<text>Granita (), in Italian also  (), is a semi-frozen dessert made from sugar, water, and various flavorings. Originally from Sicily, it is available throughout Italy in varying forms. It is related to sorbet and Italian ice; however, throughout Sicily its consistency varies. Food writer Jeffrey Steingarten says that &quot;the desired texture seems to vary from city to city&quot; on the island; on the west coast and in Palermo, it is at its chunkiest, and in the east, it is nearly as smooth as sorbet. This is largely the result of different freezing techniques: the smoother types are produced in a gelato machine, while the coarser varieties are frozen with only occasional agitation, then scraped or shaved to produce separated crystals. Although its texture varies from coarse to smooth, it is always different from that of ice cream, which is creamier, and from that of sorbet, which is more compact; this makes granita distinct and unique.

==Ingredients==

Common and traditional flavoring ingredients include lemon juice, mandarin oranges, jasmine, coffee, almonds, mint, and when in season wild strawberries and black mulberries. Chocolate granitas have a tradition in the city of Catania, but are also available in other parts of Sicily. The nuances of the Sicilian ingredients are important to the flavor of the finished granita: Sicilian lemons are a less acidic, more floral variety similar to Meyer lemons, while the almonds used contain a proportion of bitter almonds, crucial to the signature almond flavor. Another popular granita flavor is pistachio, an agricultural product of Sicily.

<doc id="607495" wikidata="Q465149" url="?curid=607495" title="Freezing-point depression">
<text>Freezing-point depression is a drop in the maximum temperature at which a substance freezes, caused when a smaller amount of another, non-volatile substance is added. Examples include adding salt into water (used in ice cream makers and for de-icing roads), alcohol in water, ethylene or propylene glycol in water (used in antifreeze in cars), adding copper to molten silver (used to make solder that flows at a lower temperature than the silver pieces being joined), or the mixing of two solids such as impurities into a finely powdered drug.

In all cases, the substance added/present in smaller amounts is considered the solute, while the original substance present in larger quantity is thought of as the solvent. The resulting liquid solution or solid-solid mixture has a lower freezing point than the pure solvent or solid because the chemical potential of the solvent in the mixture is lower than that of the pure solvent, the difference between the two being proportional to the natural logarithm of the mole fraction. In a similar manner, the chemical potential of the vapor above the solution is lower than that above a pure solvent, which results in boiling-point elevation. Freezing-point depression is what causes sea water (a mixture of salt and other compounds in water) to remain liquid at temperatures below , the freezing point of pure water.

==Explanation==
===Using vapour pressure===
The freezing point is the temperature at which the liquid solvent and solid solvent are at equilibrium, so that their vapor pressures are equal. When a non-volatile solute is added to a volatile liquid solvent, the solution vapour pressure will be lower than that of the pure solvent. As a result, the solid will reach equilibrium with the solution at a lower temperature than with the pure solvent. This explanation in terms of vapor pressure is equivalent to the argument based on chemical potential, since the chemical potential of a vapor is logarithmically related to pressure. All of the colligative properties result from a lowering of the chemical potential of the solvent in the presence of a solute. This lowering is an entropy effect. The greater randomness of the solution (as compared to the pure solvent) acts in opposition to freezing, so that a lower temperature must be reached, over a broader range, before equilibrium between the liquid solution and solid solution phases is achieved. Melting point determinations are commonly exploited in organic chemistry to aid in identifying substances and to ascertain their purity.

=== Due to concentration and entropy ===

In the liquid solution, the solvent is diluted by the addition of a solute, so that fewer molecules are available to freeze (a lower concentration of solvent exists in a solution versus pure solvent). Re-establishment of equilibrium is achieved at a lower temperature at which the rate of freezing becomes equal to the rate of liquefying. The solute is not occluding or preventing the solvent from solidifying, it is simply diluting it so there is a reduced probability of a solvent making an attempt at freezing in any given moment. 

At the lower freezing point, the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the vapor pressure of the corresponding solid, and the chemical potentials of the two phases are equal as well.

==Uses==
The phenomenon of freezing-point depression has many practical uses. The radiator fluid in an automobile is a mixture of water and ethylene glycol. The freezing-point depression prevents radiators from freezing in winter. Road salting takes advantage of this effect to lower the freezing point of the ice it is placed on. Lowering the freezing point allows the street ice to melt at lower temperatures, preventing the accumulation of dangerous, slippery ice. Commonly used sodium chloride can depress the freezing point of water to about . If the road surface temperature is lower, NaCl becomes ineffective and other salts are used, such as calcium chloride, magnesium chloride or a mixture of many. These salts are somewhat aggressive to metals, especially iron, so in airports safer media such as sodium formate, potassium formate, sodium acetate, and potassium acetate are used instead.

Freezing-point depression is used by some organisms that live in extreme cold. Such creatures have evolved means through which they can produce a high concentration of various compounds such as sorbitol and glycerol. This elevated concentration of solute decreases the freezing point of the water inside them, preventing the organism from freezing solid even as the water around them freezes, or as the air around them becomes very cold. Examples of organisms that produce antifreeze compounds include some species of arctic-living fish such as the rainbow smelt, which produces glycerol and other molecules to survive in frozen-over estuaries during the winter months. In other animals, such as the spring peeper frog (&quot;Pseudacris crucifer&quot;), the molality is increased temporarily as a reaction to cold temperatures. In the case of the peeper frog, freezing temperatures trigger a large-scale breakdown of glycogen in the frog&#x27;s liver and subsequent release of massive amounts of glucose into the blood.
With the formula below, freezing-point depression can be used to measure the degree of dissociation or the molar mass of the solute. This kind of measurement is called cryoscopy (Greek &quot;cryo&quot; = cold, &quot;scopos&quot; = observe; &quot;observe the cold&quot;) and relies on exact measurement of the freezing point. The degree of dissociation is measured by determining the van &#x27;t Hoff factor &quot;i&quot; by first determining &quot;m&quot;B and then comparing it to &quot;m&quot;solute. In this case, the molar mass of the solute must be known. The molar mass of a solute is determined by comparing &quot;m&quot;B with the amount of solute dissolved. In this case, &quot;i&quot; must be known, and the procedure is primarily useful for organic compounds using a nonpolar solvent. Cryoscopy is no longer as common a measurement method as it once was, but it was included in textbooks at the turn of the 20th century. As an example, it was still taught as a useful analytic procedure in Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Practical Organic Chemistry &quot; of 1910, in which the molar mass of naphthalene is determined using a &quot;Beckmann freezing apparatus&quot;.

===Laboratory uses===
Freezing-point depression can also be used as a purity analysis tool when analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. The results obtained are in mol%, but the method has its place, where other methods of analysis fail.

In the laboratory, lauric acid may be used to investigate the molar mass of an unknown substance via the freezing-point depression. The choice of lauric acid is convenient because the melting point of the pure compound is relatively high (43.8 °C). Its cryoscopic constant is 3.9 °C·kg/mol. By melting lauric acid with the unknown substance, allowing it to cool, and recording the temperature at which the mixture freezes, the molar mass of the unknown compound may be determined.

This is also the same principle acting in the melting-point depression observed when the melting point of an impure solid mixture is measured with a melting-point apparatus since melting and freezing points both refer to the liquid-solid phase transition (albeit in different directions).

In principle, the boiling-point elevation and the freezing-point depression could be used interchangeably for this purpose. However, the cryoscopic constant is larger than the ebullioscopic constant, and the freezing point is often easier to measure with precision, which means measurements using the freezing-point depression are more precise.

FPD measurements are also used in the dairy industry to ensure that milk has not had extra water added. Milk with a FPD of over 0.509 °C is considered to be unadulterated.

==Formula==
===For dilute solution===

If the solution is treated as an ideal solution, the extent of freezing-point depression depends only on the solute concentration that can be estimated by a simple linear relationship with the cryoscopic constant (&quot;Blagden&#x27;s Law&quot;).

:formula_1

:formula_2

where:
* formula_3 is the decrease in freezing point, defined as the freezing point formula_4 of the pure solvent minus the freezing point formula_5 of the solution, as the formula above results in a positive value given that all factors are positive. From the formula_6 calculated using the formula above, the freezing point of the solution can then be calculated as formula_7.
* formula_8, the cryoscopic constant, which is dependent on the properties of the solvent, not the solute. (Note: When conducting experiments, a higher &quot;k&quot; value makes it easier to observe larger drops in the freezing point.)
* formula_9 is the molality (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent)
* formula_10 is the van &#x27;t Hoff factor (number of ion particles per formula unit of solute, e.g. i = 2 for NaCl, 3 for BaCl2).

Some values of the cryoscopic constant &quot;K&quot;f for selected solvents:

===For concentrated solution===
The simple relation above doesn&#x27;t consider the nature of the solute, so it is only effective in a diluted solution. For a more accurate calculation at a higher concentration, for ionic solutes, Ge and Wang (2010) proposed a new equation:

:formula_11

In the above equation, &quot;T&quot;F is the normal freezing point of the pure solvent (273 K for water, for example); &quot;a&quot;liq is the activity of the solvent in the solution (water activity for aqueous solution); Δ&quot;H&quot;fusTF is the enthalpy change of fusion of the pure solvent at &quot;T&quot;F, which is 333.6 J/g for water at 273 K; Δ&quot;C&quot;fusp is the difference between the heat capacities of the liquid and solid phases at &quot;T&quot;F, which is 2.11 J/(g·K) for water.

The solvent activity can be calculated from the Pitzer model or modified TCPC model, which typically requires 3 adjustable parameters. For the TCPC model, these parameters are available for many single salts.

<text>C99 (previously C9X, formally ISO/IEC 9899:1999) is a past version of the C programming language open standard. It extends the previous version (C90) with new features for the language and the standard library, and helps implementations make better use of available computer hardware, such as IEEE 754-1985 floating-point arithmetic, and compiler technology. The C11 version of the C programming language standard, published in 2011, updates C99.

==History==
After ANSI produced the official standard for the C programming language in 1989, which became an international standard in 1990, the C language specification remained relatively static for some time, while C++ continued to evolve, largely during its own standardization effort. Normative Amendment 1 created a new standard for C in 1995, but only to correct some details of the 1989 standard and to add more extensive support for international character sets. The standard underwent further revision in the late 1990s, leading to the publication of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 in 1999, which was adopted as an ANSI standard in May 2000. The language defined by that version of the standard is commonly referred to as &quot;C99&quot;. The international C standard is maintained by the working group ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14.

==Design==

C99 is, for the most part, backward compatible with C89, but it is stricter in some ways.

In particular, a declaration that lacks a type specifier no longer has codice_1 implicitly assumed. The C standards committee decided that it was of more value for compilers to diagnose inadvertent omission of the type specifier than to silently process legacy code that relied on implicit codice_1. In practice, compilers are likely to display a warning, then assume codice_1 and continue translating the program.

C99 introduced several new features, many of which had already been implemented as extensions in several compilers:

* inline functions
* intermingled declarations and code: variable declaration is no longer restricted to file scope or the start of a compound statement (block)
* several new data types, including codice_4, optional extended integer types, an explicit Boolean data type, and a codice_5 type to represent complex numbers
* variable-length arrays (although subsequently relegated in C11 to a conditional feature that implementations are not required to support)
* flexible array members
* support for one-line comments beginning with codice_6, as in BCPL, C++ and Java
* new library functions, such as codice_7
* new headers, such as codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, and codice_11
* type-generic math (macro) functions, in codice_12, which select a math library function based upon codice_13, codice_14, or codice_15 arguments, etc.
* improved support for IEEE floating point
* designated initializers (for example, initializing a structure by field names: codice_16)
* compound literals (for instance, it is possible to construct structures in function calls: codice_17)
* support for variadic macros (macros with a variable number of arguments)
* codice_18 qualification allows more aggressive code optimization, removing compile-time array access advantages previously held by FORTRAN over ANSI C
* universal character names, which allows user variables to contain other characters than the standard character set: four-digit or eight-digit hexadecimal sequences 
* keyword codice_19 in array indices in parameter declarations

Parts of the C99 standard are included in the current version of the C++ standard, including integer types, headers, and library functions. Variable-length arrays are not among these included parts because C++&#x27;s Standard Template Library already includes similar functionality.

==IEEE 754 floating-point support==
A major feature of C99 is its numerics support, and in particular its support for access to the features of IEEE 754-1985 (also known as IEC 60559) floating-point hardware present in the vast majority of modern processors (defined in &quot;Annex F IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic&quot;). Platforms without IEEE 754 hardware can also implement it in software.

On platforms with IEEE 754 floating point:
codice_20 tends to limit the risk of rounding errors affecting numerically unstable expressions (see IEEE 754 design rationale) and is the designed default method for x87 hardware, but yields unintuitive behavior for the unwary user; codice_21 was the default evaluation method originally used in K&amp;R C, which promoted all floats to double in expressions; and codice_22 is also commonly used and specifies a strict &quot;evaluate to type&quot; of the operands. (For gcc, codice_23 is the default on 32 bit x86, and codice_24 is the default on 64 bit x86-64, but codice_23 can be specified on x86-64 with option -mfpmath=387.) Before C99, compilers could round intermediate results inconsistently, especially when using x87 floating-point hardware, leading to compiler-specific behaviour; such inconsistencies are not permitted in compilers conforming to C99 (annex F).

=== Example ===
The following annotated example C99 code for computing a continued fraction function demonstrates the main features:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;float.h&gt;
#include &lt;fenv.h&gt;
#include &lt;tgmath.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;
#include &lt;assert.h&gt;

double compute_fn(double z) // [1]
 #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON // [2]

 assert(FLT_EVAL_METHOD == 2); // [3]

 if (isnan(z)) // [4]
 puts(&quot;z is not a number&quot;);

 if (isinf(z))
 puts(&quot;z is infinite&quot;);

 long double r = 7.0 - 3.0/(z - 2.0 - 1.0/(z - 7.0 + 10.0/(z - 2.0 - 2.0/(z - 3.0)))); // [5, 6]

 feclearexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO); // [7]

 bool raised = fetestexcept(FE_OVERFLOW); // [8]

 if (raised)
 puts(&quot;Unanticipated overflow.&quot;);

 return r;

int main(void)
 #ifndef __STDC_IEC_559__
 puts(&quot;Warning: __STDC_IEC_559__ not defined. IEEE 754 floating point not fully supported.&quot;); // [9]
 #endif

 #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON

 #ifdef TEST_NUMERIC_STABILITY_UP
 fesetround(FE_UPWARD); // [10]
 #elif TEST_NUMERIC_STABILITY_DOWN
 fesetround(FE_DOWNWARD);
 #endif

 printf(&quot;%.7g\n&quot;, compute_fn(3.0));
 printf(&quot;%.7g\n&quot;, compute_fn(NAN));

 return 0;


Footnotes:
# Compile with: 
# As the IEEE 754 status flags are manipulated in this function, this #pragma is needed to avoid the compiler incorrectly rearranging such tests when optimising. (Pragmas are usually implementation-defined, but those prefixed with codice_26 are defined in the C standard.)
# C99 defines a limited number of expression evaluation methods: the current compilation mode can be checked to ensure it meets the assumptions the code was written under.
# The special values such as NaN and positive or negative infinity can be tested and set.
# codice_15 is defined as IEEE 754 double extended or quad precision if available. Using higher precision than required for intermediate computations can minimize round-off error (the typedef codice_28 can be used for code that is portable under all codice_29s).
# The main function to be evaluated. Although it appears that some arguments to this continued fraction, e.g., 3.0, would lead to a divide-by-zero error, in fact the function is well-defined at 3.0 and division by 0 will simply return a +infinity that will then correctly lead to a finite result: IEEE 754 is defined not to trap on such exceptions by default and is designed so that they can very often be ignored, as in this case. (If codice_29 is defined as 2 then all internal computations including constants will be performed in long double precision; if codice_29 is defined as 0 then additional care is need to ensure this, including possibly additional casts and explicit specification of constants as long double.)
# As the raised divide-by-zero flag is not an error in this case, it can simply be dismissed to clear the flag for use by later code.
# In some cases, other exceptions may be regarded as an error, such as overflow (although it can in fact be shown that this cannot occur in this case).
# codice_32 is to be defined only if &quot;Annex F IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic&quot; is fully implemented by the compiler and the C library (users should be aware that this macro is sometimes defined while it should not be).
# The default rounding mode is round to nearest (with the even rounding rule in the halfway cases) for IEEE 754, but explicitly setting the rounding mode toward + and - infinity (by defining codice_33 etc. in this example, when debugging) can be used to diagnose numerical instability. This method can be used even if codice_34 is part of a separately compiled binary library. But depending on the function, numerical instabilities cannot always be detected.

==Version detection==
A standard macro codice_35 is defined with value codice_36 to indicate that C99 support is available. As with the codice_37 macro for C90, codice_35 can be used to write code that will compile differently for C90 and C99 compilers, as in this example that ensures that codice_39 is available in either case (by replacing it with codice_19 in C90 to avoid linker errors).
#if __STDC_VERSION__ &gt;= 199901L
 /* &quot;inline&quot; is a keyword */
#else
# define inline static
#endif
==Implementations==
Most C compilers provide support for at least some of the features introduced in C99.

Historically, Microsoft has been slow to implement new C features in their Visual C++ tools, instead focusing mainly on supporting developments in the C++ standards. However, with the introduction of Visual C++ 2013 Microsoft implemented a limited subset of C99, which was expanded in Visual C++ 2015.


==Future work==
Since ratification of the 1999 C standard, the standards working group prepared technical reports specifying improved support for embedded processing, additional character data types (Unicode support), and library functions with improved bounds checking. Work continues on technical reports addressing decimal floating point, additional mathematical special functions, and additional dynamic memory allocation functions. The C and C++ standards committees have been collaborating on specifications for threaded programming.

The next revision of the C standard, C11, was ratified in 2011. The C standards committee adopted guidelines that limited the adoption of new features that have not been tested by existing implementations. Much effort went into developing a memory model, in order to clarify sequence points and to support threaded programming.

<text>Nightwear – also called sleepwear, or nightclothes – is clothing designed to be worn while sleeping. The style of nightwear worn may vary with the seasons, with warmer styles being worn in colder conditions and vice versa. Some styles or materials are selected to be visually appealing or erotic in addition to their functional purposes.

==Variants==
Nightwear includes:
* Adult onesie - all-in-one footed sleepsuit worn by adults, similar to an infant onesie or children&#x27;s blanket sleeper and usually made from cotton.
* Babydoll - a short, sometimes sleeveless, loose-fitting nightgown or negligee for women, generally designed to resemble a young girl&#x27;s nightgown. 
* Blanket sleeper - a warm sleeping garment for infants and young children.
* Chemise - a delicate, loose-fitting, sleeveless, shirt-like lingerie garment for women, typically intended to feature a provocative appearance.
* Negligee - loose-fitting women&#x27;s nightwear intended to have sensuous appeal, usually made of sheer or semi-translucent fabrics and trimmed with lace or other fine material and bows. 
* Nightcap - warm cloth cap worn with pajamas, a nightshirt or a nightgown.
* Nightgown - loose hanging nightwear for women, typically made from cotton, silk, satin, or nylon. 
* Nightshirt - loose fitting shirt reaching to below the knees.
* Pajamas - traditionally loose fitting, two-piece garments.
* Peignoir - long outer garment for women, usually sheer and made of chiffon; frequently sold with a matching nightgown, negligee, or panties.
Other types of garment commonly worn for sleeping—but not exclusively so— include gym shorts, t-shirts, tank tops, sweatpants, as well as underwear and/or socks (worn without outerwear). Sleeping in the nude is also common, especially in warmer climates.

==Customs==
According to a 2004 United States survey, 13% of men wear pajamas or nightgowns for sleeping, whereas 31% wear underwear and another 31% sleep nude. Among women, 55% wear pajamas or nightgowns, which were counted under the same option:

A survey by the BBC &quot;The Clothes Show Magazine&quot; in 1996 revealed the following about sleepwear in the UK:

†Most common response in &#x27;Other&#x27; from women was &quot;outdoor clothes&quot;, from men &quot;shorts&quot;.

== Children&#x27;s nightwear ==

On 22 December 2011, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a letter to manufacturers, distributors, importers and retailers reminding the apparel industry of the enforcement policy and their obligations associated with children&#x27;s sleepwear and loungewear.

The commission&#x27;s regulations define the term &quot;children&#x27;s sleepwear&quot; to include any product of wearing apparel (in sizes 0–14), such as nightgowns, pajamas, or similar or related items, such as robes, intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping, except: (1) diapers and underwear; (2) &quot;infant garments&quot;, sized for a child nine months of age or younger; and (3) &quot;tight-fitting garments&quot; that meet specific maximum dimensions.

All children&#x27;s sleepwear and loungewear sold in the US are required to comply with the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA) using the standards for Flammability of Children&#x27;s Sleepwear 16 C.F.R. Parts 1615 and 1616. Moreover, they have to comply with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA) requirements including tracking labels, a certificate of compliance, meeting requirements for lead content and surface coatings, and meeting requirements for phthalates.

<text>Henri Jozef Machiel Nouwen (January 24, 1932 – September 21, 1996) was a Dutch Catholic priest, professor, writer and theologian. His interests were rooted primarily in psychology, pastoral ministry, spirituality, social justice and community. Over the course of his life, Nouwen was heavily influenced by the work of Anton Boisen, Thomas Merton, Rembrandt, Vincent van Gogh, and Jean Vanier.

After nearly two decades of teaching at academic institutions including the University of Notre Dame, Yale Divinity School and Harvard Divinity School, Nouwen went on to work with people with intellectual and developmental disabilities at the L&#x27;Arche Daybreak community in Richmond Hill, Ontario.

== Biography ==

===Early life===

Henri Nouwen was born in Nijkerk, the Netherlands on January 24, 1932. He was the oldest of four children born to Laurent J. M. Nouwen and Maria Nouwen (née Ramselaar). Nouwen&#x27;s father was a tax lawyer and his mother worked as a bookkeeper for her family&#x27;s business in Amersfoort. His younger brother was a prominent Dutch businessman and his uncle was a Roman Catholic priest in the Archdiocese of Utrecht and a co-founder of the .
Nouwen studied at the Jesuit Aloysius College in The Hague before spending a year at the minor seminary in Apeldoorn. His year at the school was spent preparing for six years of study for the priesthood, consisting of training in philosophy and theology, at the major seminary in Rijsenburg.

===Priesthood===
Nouwen was ordained a Catholic priest for the Archdiocese of Utrecht on July 21, 1957, by Bernardus Alfrink at St. Catherine&#x27;s Cathedral in Utrecht. Eager to learn more about himself and the people he counseled, Nouwen requested permission from Alfrink to study psychology instead of theology. His request was granted and from 1957 to 1964 he studied at the Catholic University of Nijmegen. In studying the fundamentals of clinical psychology, Nouwen struggled with the lack of interdisciplinary analysis. He sought to use psychology as a means of exploring the human side of faith which he felt was being overlooked, from a pastoral standpoint, in broader theological discussions. During his studies at the university, he was greatly influenced by Han Fortmann, a Dutch psychologist of religion whose writing about action and contemplation in a busy world are mirrored in Nouwen&#x27;s own work. For his thesis work, Nouwen focused on Anton Boisen, an American minister credited with founding the clinical pastoral education movement. The thesis was not approved due to a lack of scientific analysis and clinical study. Rather than revising the work to obtain a doctorate, Nouwen completed his studies in 1964 by obtaining a doctorandus degree.

After receiving his &quot;doctorandus&quot; (doctoral degree), Nouwen studied for two years as a Fellow in the Religion and Psychiatry Program at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, and was influenced by psychologist Gordon Allport. Nouwen completed his clinical pastoral training at the Topeka State Hospital and graduated from the Menninger Foundation&#x27;s training program in theology and psychiatric theory on June 19, 1965. During his time at the Clinic he found he preferred direct contact with patients over the more scientific and medical analysis of certain branches of psychology. This prompted an examination of his professional practice in order to better integrate spiritual ministry with modern psychology. Over the course of this same period, Nouwen began to engage with social and political happenings, including the Civil Rights Movement. In 1965 he traveled to the Southern United States to participate in, and later publish an article about, the Selma to Montgomery marches.

From 1966 to 1968 he was a visiting professor at the University of Notre Dame. From 1968 to 1970 he worked at the Amsterdam Joint Pastoral Institute and taught psychology and spirituality at the Catholic Theological University of Utrecht. In 1971 he received his doctorandus degree in theology.

Between 1971 and 1981 Nouwen was a professor of pastoral theology at Yale Divinity School, where he began to establish a broad readership of his work as a contributor to various publications including the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot; and as the author of several books based on personal experience. During his time at Yale, Nouwen took several sabbaticals, some of which informed his writing. In 1976 he was a Fellow at the Collegeville Institute for Ecumenical and Cultural Research at Saint John&#x27;s Abbey, Collegeville, Minnesota, and in 1978 he was scholar-in-residence at the Pontifical North American College in Rome.

While a professor at Yale Nouwen also spent several months at the Abbey of the Genesee. His first visit began on June 1, 1974, and lasted seven months. While there he kept a journal that was published as &quot;Genesee Diary: Report from a Trappist Monastery&quot; in 1976. He returned again in 1979, after the death of his mother, which led to the publication of &quot;A Cry For Mercy: Prayers from the Genesee&quot;. Though Nouwen concluded he was not suited for Trappist life, the Abbey of the Genesee and his relationship with then abbott John Eudes Bamberger continued to be of great importance to him. The Abbey served as his home base for more than a year after he resigned from Yale and it was where he chose to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his ordination as a priest on August 6, 1982.

After leaving Yale in 1981, Nouwen took a six-month trip to South America visiting Bolivia and Peru. Upon his return to the United States in 1983, Nouwen was appointed at the Harvard Divinity School as Professor of Divinity and Horace De Y. Lentz Lecturer. The half-time appointment allowed Nouwen to split his time between teaching at the Divinity School and working with a theological center in Latin America. Nouwen taught at the school until his resignation in 1985. In 1985 and 1986 he spent nine months with the L&#x27;Arche community in France.

===L&#x27;Arche===

Nouwen&#x27;s spirituality was greatly influenced by his friendship with Jean Vanier. The two men met while Nouwen was teaching at Harvard. Vanier sensed how lost Nouwen was feeling and invited him to visit Trosly-Breuil. Nouwen visited Vanier at the French community, the first in the L&#x27;Arche network, twice before returning in 1985 for a nine-month residency. The stay helped Nouwen find a purpose that had been missing. As Robert A. Jonas explains: &quot;Henri had always wondered what a Eucharistically centered community would be like, and now he had found one at L&#x27;Arche.&quot; 

During Nouwen&#x27;s time in France he traveled to Toronto, Ontario, to officiate at a wedding and sought permission to stay for a week at L&#x27;Arche Daybreak in Richmond Hill. While there a core member named Raymond was hit by a car and left in critical condition. Nouwen provided spiritual guidance to the community and Raymond’s family, ultimately helping to reconcile the community and the family, who partially blamed Daybreak for Raymond&#x27;s injuries. Nouwen&#x27;s intervention had such an impact that the Daybreak members asked him to serve as their pastor. Nouwen accepted and moved in the fall of 1986 to L&#x27;Arche Daybreak, where he would spend the last ten years of his life.

While at Daybreak Nouwen was paired with Adam Arnett, a core member at L&#x27;Arche Daybreak with profound developmental disabilities. &quot;It is I, not Adam, who gets the main benefit from our friendship,&quot; Nouwen insisted. Nouwen wrote about his relationship with Arnett in a book entitled &quot;Adam: God&#x27;s Beloved&quot;.

===Sexuality===

Nouwen struggled with his sexuality, which may have contributed to his feelings of self-doubt. Although this struggle was known by those close to him, Nouwen never publicly identified himself as homosexual despite acknowledging the matter in discussions with friends and alluding to a personal struggle in his private journals. In his book &quot;The Return of the Prodigal Son,&quot; Nouwen describes a friendship that had him under a spell, did him no good and when it finally collapsed left him in a depressive mood and in search of self-esteem and acceptance by others. Biographer Michael Ford referenced these instances in the biography &quot;Wounded Prophet&quot;, which was published after Nouwen&#x27;s death. Ford suggests that Nouwen only became fully comfortable with his sexual orientation in the last few years of his life, and that Nouwen&#x27;s depression was caused, in part, by the conflict between his priestly vows of celibacy and the sense of loneliness and longing for intimacy that he experienced. &quot;This took an enormous emotional, spiritual and physical toll on his life and may have contributed to his early death.&quot; While his struggle to reconcile his priestly vows of chastity with his human desire for physical and emotional intimacy appears in his writings, there is no evidence that Nouwen ever broke his vow of celibacy.

===Death and legacy===
Nouwen died in the Netherlands on September 21, 1996, from a sudden heart attack, while en route to Russia to participate in a Dutch documentary about his book &quot;The Return of the Prodigal Son&quot;. Nouwen&#x27;s first funeral Mass was held on September 24 at St. Catherine&#x27;s Cathedral in Utrecht with a eulogy offered by Jean Vanier, after which Nouwen&#x27;s body was flown to Canada for burial by the L&#x27;Arche Daybreak community. The second funeral Mass was held on September 28 at the Slovak Catholic Cathedral of the Transfiguration in Markham, Ontario, following a full-day wake at St. Mary Immaculate Catholic Church in Richmond Hill on September 27. Nouwen was laid to rest in a pine coffin built in L&#x27;Arche Daybreak&#x27;s The Woodery and colourfully painted by members of the community. He is buried in St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church Cemetery in Richmond Hill in keeping with his desire to be near the graves of other Daybreak community members. There is also a memorial marker for Nouwen in Geysteren, NL at the grave site of his parents.

Prior to his death he entrusted Sue Mosteller with his estate, making her the literary executrix of his works. The founding of the Henri J.M. Nouwen Archives and Research Collection at the John M. Kelly Library, University of St. Michael&#x27;s College, was the culmination of Mosteller&#x27;s effort to centralize Nouwen&#x27;s personal records. The work involved organizing his material at L&#x27;Arche Daybreak, which included personal correspondence, original manuscripts, and audio visual material, and negotiating with the Yale Divinity School Library for the release of records Nouwen had begun depositing there as a faculty member in 1975. The Nouwen Archives opened in September 2000.

He has an award named for him, the &quot;Henri Nouwen Leadership Award&quot;, given out by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, Religion and Spirituality Division.
There is an endowed lectureship in Classical Christian Spirituality named after him at Drew University. 
There is also an elementary school named after him in Richmond Hill, Ontario.

== Writing ==
Before his death Nouwen published 39 books and authored hundreds of articles. His books have sold over 7 million copies worldwide and have been published in more than 30 languages. In a magazine survey conducted by &quot;Christian Century&quot; in 2003 Nouwen&#x27;s work was indicated as a first choice of authors for Catholic and mainline Protestant clergy. His books include &quot;The Wounded Healer&quot;, &quot;In the Name of Jesus&quot;, &quot;Clowning in Rome&quot;, &quot;The Life of the Beloved&quot; and &quot;The Way of the Heart&quot;, along with what is recognized as one of his most popular books, &quot;The Return of the Prodigal Son&quot;.

While visiting the L&#x27;Arche Trosly-Breuil community in France, he saw a poster of Rembrandt&#x27;s painting &quot;The Return of the Prodigal Son&quot; that made a deep impression on him. He decided to see the painting personally and traveled to Saint Petersburg (Leningrad at that time) to visit the Hermitage Museum where it is kept. This resulted in a several-day contemplation of the painting, which prompted him to write a book of the same name. &quot;The Return of the Prodigal Son&quot; was ranked number 66 on a list of 100 best Christian books compiled by the &quot;Church Times&quot; in 2014.

===Themes===
Nouwen was known to suffer from loneliness and a need for interpersonal connection, which he wrote about openly. His popularity as a spiritual guide has been linked to his capacity to describe his personal struggles in a relatable manner. He credited his approach to an interest in the daily life of people and his own journey with Christian life:

One of Nouwen&#x27;s major ongoing themes involved his struggle reconciling his depression with his Christian faith. His most famous work on this topic is the &quot;Inner Voice of Love,&quot; his diary from December 1987 to June 1988 during one of his most serious bouts with clinical depression. Nouwen also explored this theme in &quot;Return of the Prodigal Son&quot;, describing love and forgiveness as unconditional. In the book, he invites the reader to follow him in his personal return to the spiritual fountains and in a parallel meditation on all the characters of the parable, their rendering by Rembrandt, and the painter&#x27;s personal life.

Nouwen also wrote several essays on the necessity of peacemaking. He used God&#x27;s Love as a justification for the preservation of life, as well as for his opposition to both the ongoing Cold War and the intervention of the United States in Vietnam. This was of a piece with his conviction of the oneness of all peoples under God:

==Public speaking==
Nouwen was a frequent public speaker. In addition to his teaching responsibilities, he traveled extensively leading retreats and preaching. With a distinct accent and animated speaking style, Nouwen was known for his engaging and expressive style of communication. The experience of seeing him preach has been compared to being at the theater or seeing a musical conductor at work. It was not uncommon for Nouwen to enthusiastically jump around or wave his arms and hands during speaking events and classroom lectures. Bob Massie describes the experience of watching Nouwen speak in &quot;Befriending Life&quot; (2001): &quot;His squeezing, tugging gestures made it look like he was striving to milk meaning directly out of the air. He would point his fingers down and rotate his wrists as though trying to stir a separate little pot with each digit.&quot;

Nouwen appealed to many audiences, including Anglicans and evangelicals because of his Jesus-centered spirituality. In 1992 he was invited by Robert H. Schuller to preach on &quot;Hour of Power&quot; at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, California. Nouwen appeared over three consecutive Sundays and preached on the topic of belovedness. Recordings of his appearance were later used by Schuller as a model for preaching when instructing new ministers.

<text>Highway 18 is a short main vehicle route in the Cowichan Valley Regional District on Vancouver Island, connecting the city of Duncan on the Trans-Canada Highway with the community of Lake Cowichan, on the shore of Cowichan Lake. The highway first opened to vehicle traffic in 1953, and was re-routed to a straighter and wider alignment in 1970. The speed limit along most of the highway is .

In late 2006, drivers using Highway 18 experienced broken parts (such as windows with big shatter marks) on their cars, most of these came from loose rocks after passing other drivers. This generated anger and was called the &quot;Sealcoat Job&quot; because of the bad gravel sealcoating of the stretch to Duncan from the Cowichan Lake Road junction at Lake Cowichan by the new highway contractor company.

In early 2004, a proposal was brought forward to extend Highway 18 west from Lake Cowichan, all the way along existing logging roads to the community of Port Renfrew on the southwest coast of Vancouver Island, as a way of rerouting traffic from the northern part of the Island to Victoria in case of a bad accident or any other extraordinary event forcing a closure of the Malahat. The highway between Mesachie Lake and Port Renfrew is known as the Pacific Marine Circle Route.

<text>Executive Outcomes is a private military company (PMC) founded in South Africa in 1989 by Eeben Barlow, a former lieutenant-colonel of the South African Defence Force. It later became part of the South African-based holding company Strategic Resource Corporation. The company was reestablished in 2020.

==History==

===Background===
In 1989, following the conclusion of the South African Border War in Angola and Namibia, the apartheid government was looking at broad cuts in its military personnel. This initial drawdown accelerated rapidly as the apartheid system was dismantled in the early 1990s. African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela demanded that then South African President Frederik Willem de Klerk dismantle some of the South African and South West African Special Forces units such as 32 Battalion and Koevoet. One of these was the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB), a unit that carried out covert operations which included assassinations of government opponents, and worked to bypass the United Nations apartheid sanctions by setting up overseas front companies.

Only Koevoet, being part of the South West African Police (SWAPOL), was disbanded as part of independence negotiations for South West Africa (now Namibia). Many members of the other units, or simply former national servicemen, were recruited by Executive Outcomes (EO).

===Formation===
Eeben Barlow and Michael Mullen, formerly in charge of the Western European section of the CCB, established Executive Outcomes (EO) in 1989. Its aim was to provide specialised covert training to Special Forces members. Barlow was also awarded a contract by Debswana to train a selected group of security officers to infiltrate and penetrate the illegal diamond dealing syndicates in Botswana. When Debswana discovered EO was training the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA), it promptly cancelled EO&#x27;s contract.

&quot;Many of Barlow&#x27;s Special Forces students would later join him at EO after he started recruiting men to assist with the training of the Angolan forces,&quot; says Walter Halicki, one of Eeben&#x27;s associates in the FAA.

The company also went on to recruit many of its personnel from the units President F. W. De Klerk disbanded. Even former enemy fighters of the uMkhonto we Sizwe and Azanian People&#x27;s Liberation Army were recruited as well since many were found out of work after their own restructuring and integration to the South African National Defense Force. At its peak, EO employed about 2,000 former soldiers.

Barlow registered Executive Outcomes Ltd in the UK on the insistence of the South African Reserve Bank. There is some confusion over this issue as a top secret British intelligence report states that &quot;Executive Outcomes was registered in the UK in September 1993 by Anthony (Tony) Buckingham, a British businessman and Simon Mann, a former British officer&quot;. Buckingham denies that he registered EO in London and consistently denies any &quot;corporate ties&quot; to EO.

===Key personnel===
Apart from founder Eeben Barlow (CEO), other senior EO personnel were Lafras Luitingh (Deputy to CEO) and Nic van der Bergh (CEO after Barlow resigned). Senior associates included Simon Mann, Tony Buckingham and Derek Williams who, along with Barlow and Luitingh were the executive officers of Ibis Air, the aircraft procurement organisation for Executive Outcomes which was essentially their private &quot;air force&quot;. Crause Steyl was the South African-based director of Ibis Air.

==Activities==
===Angola===
Executive Outcomes initially trained and later fought on behalf of the Angolan government against UNITA after UNITA refused to accept the election results in 1992. This contract was awarded to the company after EO had assisted Ranger Oil with an equipment recovery operation in the harbour town of Soyo. Dubbed by the South African media as an attempt to assassinate the rebel leader Dr. Jonas Savimbi, EO found itself under constant UNITA attacks where it lost three of its men. This action saw EO as being recognised by the FAA and a contract to train its forces was awarded. In a short space of time, UNITA was defeated on the battlefield and sued for peace. The Angolan government, under pressure from the UN and the US, were forced to terminate EO&#x27;s contract. EO was replaced by the UN&#x27;s peacekeeping force known as UNAVEM. Angola returned to war shortly thereafter.

===Sierra Leone===
In March 1995, the company contained an insurrection of guerrillas known as the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone, regained control of the diamond fields, and forced a negotiated peace.

In the case of Angola this led to a cease fire and the Lusaka Protocol, which ended the Angolan Civil War – albeit only for a few years. 
In Sierra Leone, however, the government capitulated to international pressure to have EO withdraw in favour of an ineffective peacekeeping force, allowing the RUF to rebuild and the capital in &quot;Operation No Living Thing&quot;.

As is characteristic of one of the first PMCs, Executive Outcomes was directly involved militarily in Angola and Sierra Leone. The company was notable in its ability to provide all aspects of a highly trained modern army to the less professional government forces of Sierra Leone and Angola. For instance, in Sierra Leone, Executive Outcomes fielded not only professional fighting men, but armour and support aircraft such as one Mi-24 Hind and two Mi-8 Hip helicopters, the BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle and T-72 main battle tank. These were bought from sources in the worldwide arms trade within Africa as well as Eastern Europe.

===Ibis Air===
Ibis Air was a partner business entity that provided EO with airborne services, including medevac capabilities via a Boeing 727 with the registry D2-FLZ. Ibis Air also owned a small fleet of MiG-23 &quot;Flogger&quot; fighters and Pilatus PC-7 turbo-prop trainers converted for the reconnaissance and ground attack capabilities using SNEB air-to-ground rockets. It was also allowed to operate MiG-27 &quot;Flogger&quot; strike aircraft and Su-25 &quot;Frogfoot&quot; ground support aircraft that were loaned out to EO by the Angolan Air Force.

====Other contracts====
Executive Outcomes had contracts with multinational corporations such as De Beers, Chevron, Rio Tinto Zinc and Texaco. The governments of Angola, Sierra Leone and Indonesia were also clients.

==Dissolution==
Executive Outcomes actively encouraged the South African government to enforce a regulation of PMCs as several South African and international companies were masquerading for work under the banner of Executive Outcomes. Additionally, Executive Outcomes was actively engaged in providing input into the formulation of the bill which became known as &quot;Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act&quot; in 1998.

The aim of the Act was to stop mercenary activities by the dual actions of:
# preventing direct participation as a combatant in armed conflict for private gain including the training, recruitment and use of mercenaries; and,
# requiring approval of the National Conventional Arms Control Committee for offering of military assistance overseas.

Executive Outcomes was duly provided with a licence stipulating that it met the requirements of the newly introduced Act.

Executive Outcomes was dissolved on 31 December 1998.

==Sandline International==
Executive Outcomes was often loosely linked with the United Kingdom private military company Sandline International. In 1997 Sandline directly subcontracted Executive Outcomes for their operation in Papua New Guinea to oust the rebels holding the Pangua mine on Bougainville Island which led to the so-called &quot;Sandline affair&quot; when news of the government&#x27;s intention to hire mercenaries was leaked to the Australian press.

The Commander of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force, Jerry Singirok – who reversed his support for the operation – ordered the detaining of all the mercenaries on their arrival, and forced the Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan to resign with Papua New Guinea coming close to a military coup.

==Sterling Corporate Services==
A UN report from July 2012 criticised the South African security company Sterling Corporate Services for assembling a &quot;private army&quot; in defiance of international agreements and also of Somalian sanctions. The report was conducted by the UN&#x27;s Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea (SEMG) and revealed strong links to Executive Outcomes.

==Reestablishment==
In November 2020, founder Eeben Barlow stepped down from his position as chairman of STTEP to restart Executive Outcomes. He mentioned that part of his company&#x27;s mission would now be &quot;to expose those media and intelligence whores that thrive on lying for secret payments.&quot; Barlow claimed that the decision to restart the company came at the request of &quot;some governments&quot;, which he had &quot;little choice but to accept.&quot;

<text>The mourning collared dove or African mourning dove (Streptopelia decipiens) is a dove which is a widespread resident breeding bird in Africa south of the Sahara. Despite its name, it is not related to the North American mourning dove (&quot;Zenaida macroura&quot;). This species is common or abundant near water. They often mingle peacefully with other doves.

==Description==
The mourning collared dove is a largish, stocky pigeon, up to 31 cm in length. Its back, wings and tail are pale brown. The head is grey and the underparts are pink, shading to pale grey on the belly. There is a black hind neck patch edged with white. The legs and a patch of bare skin around the eye are red.

When flying, it shows blackish flight feathers and extensive white in the tail, the latter being a distinction from the similar but larger red-eyed dove. The call is a fast &quot;krrrrrrrr, oo-OO, oo&quot;.

Sexes are similar, but immatures are duller than adults, and have scalloping on the body feathers.

==Behaviour==

The mourning collared dove&#x27;s flight is quick, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general.

===Diet and feeding===
Mourning collared doves eat grass seeds, grains and other vegetation. They are quite terrestrial, and usually forage on the ground. Unlike several other species in this genus, they are quite gregarious and often feed in groups.

===Reproduction===
It builds a stick nest in a tree, often a mangrove, and lays two white eggs.

<text>Evolutionary anthropology, the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and of the relation between hominids and non-hominid primates, builds on natural science and on social science. Various fields and disciplines of evolutionary anthropology include:

* human evolution and anthropogeny
* paleoanthropology and paleontology of both human and non-human primates
* primatology and primate ethology
* the sociocultural evolution of human behavior, including phylogenetic approaches to historical linguistics
* the cultural anthropology and sociology of humans
* the archaeological study of human technology and of its changes over time and space
* human evolutionary genetics and changes in the human genome over time
* the neuroscience, endocrinology, and neuroanthropology of human and primate cognition, culture, actions and abilities
* human behavioural ecology and the interaction between humans and the environment
* studies of human anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and differences and changes between species, variation between human groups, and relationships to cultural factors

Evolutionary anthropology studies both the biological and the cultural evolution of humans, past and present. Based on a scientific approach, it brings together fields such as archaeology, behavioral ecology, psychology, primatology, and genetics. As a dynamic and interdisciplinary field, it draws on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

Studies of human biological evolution generally focus on the evolution of the human form. Cultural evolution involves the study of cultural change over time and space and frequently incorporates cultural-transmission models. Cultural evolution is not the same as biological evolution: human culture involves the transmission of cultural information (compare memetics), and such transmission can behave in ways quite distinct from human biology and genetics. The study of cultural change increasingly takes place through cladistics and genetic models.

<doc id="607524" wikidata="Q1188977" url="?curid=607524" title="Urban fantasy">
<text>Urban fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy, placing supernatural elements in a contemporary urban-affected setting. The combination provides the writer with a platform for classic fantasy tropes, quixotic plot-elements, and unusual characters—without demanding the creation of an entire imaginary world.

Precursors of urban fantasy are found in popular fiction of the 19th century - and the present use of the term dates back to the 1970s - but much of its audience was established in the 1930s-50s with the success of light supernatural fare in the movies (and later on TV). The genre&#x27;s current publishing popularity began in 1980s North America, as writers and publishers were encouraged by the success of Stephen King and Anne Rice.

==Characteristics==
Urban fantasy combines imaginary/unrealistic elements of plot, character, theme, or setting with a largely-familiar world—combining the familiar and the strange. The world does not have to imitate the real world, but can instead be set in a different world or time. Such elements may exist secretly in the world or may occur openly. Fantastic components may be magic, paranormal beings, recognizable mythic or folk-tale plots, or thematic tropes (such as a quest, or a battle of good and evil). Authors may use current urban myths, borrow fictional technologies, or even invent occult practices, as well as using established supernatural characters and events from folklore, literature, film, or comics. 

The urban component is usually found in the setting—typically a large or small city—or even a suburban community in a metropolitan area. Use of contemporary technology (such as automotive vehicles or communications) and everyday community and social institutions (such as libraries, schools/universities, or markets) establish a familiar context. The period in which the action occurs may be the fairly recent past or the near future, but will typically require merely only casual historical or other special knowledge from the reader. The city-setting is a tool; used to establish a tone, to help move the plot, and may even be acknowledged as a character itself.

Urban fantasy is most often a sub-genre of low fantasy (where magical events intrude on an otherwise-normal world) and/or hard fantasy (treating magic as something understandable and explainable), and works may be found mixing with sub-genres of, for example, horror, occult detective fiction, or the various &quot;punk&quot; genres. Common themes include coexistence or conflict between humans and other beings, and the changes such characters and events bring to local life. Many authors, publishers, and readers particularly distinguish urban fantasy from works of paranormal romance, which use similar characters and settings, but focus on the romantic relationships between characters.
The YA author Scott Westerfeld distinguished between urban fantasy and a subgenre called elfpunk on the basis that 
&quot;Elfpunk is pretty much full of elves and fairies and traditional shit [...] Urban fantasy, though, can have some totally made-up fucked-up creatures.&quot;

==History==
===Predecessors===
During the late Romantic era, writers of sensational fiction (including Mary Shelley, Dickens, Hoffmann, Le Fanu, Hugo, Poe, Wilkie Collins, Stoker, &amp;c.) wrote melodramas to explore social anxieties due to population shifts from farms into industrial centers, novel technologies, and fear of &#x27;foreign&#x27; immigrants. Re-imagining the contemporary universe by manipulating one or more social/technical realities gave us popular works by Jules Verne, as well as Doyle&#x27;s Professor Challenger stories. Jack London&#x27;s 1908 dystopian novel &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; preceded H. G. Wells&#x27; novel &quot;The Sleeper Awakes.&quot; Karel Čapek, Aldous Huxley, and even Sinclair Lewis (in his novel &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;) all wrote adventure stories that were &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot;, and &quot;dystopian&quot;.

Around the same time, popular mail-delivered periodicals appeared in Europe and the Americas (&quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; (1821), &quot;Godey&#x27;s Lady&#x27;s Book&quot; (1830), and Harper&#x27;s Weekly (1857)). The success of these magazines led to ones that targeted specific readerships: &quot;Boys&#x27; Own Magazine&quot; (1855), and &quot;Argosy&quot; (1882) among them. All of these magazines published short and serialized fiction features, as well as reportage, instructional articles, illustration, and opinion. Before WW1, fantasy vied for magazine space with westerns, romance, mysteries, military adventure, comedies, and horror. Writers often published stories in multiple genres - among them Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert E. Howard, Isaac Asimov, and Elmore Leonard. A sought-after hallmark for many of these writers was &quot;&quot;realism&quot; - although the stories were outrageously fantastic.

Dime novels also arrived before the Civil War; some of the earliest re-printing serials from magazines. Commonly associated with Western adventure, they also encompassed romance and crime-fiction. Robert deGraff founded Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Pocket Books in 1939, he distributed not only to the 2,800 US bookstores, but also in more than a hundred thousand drugstores, news-stands, 5-&amp;-10s, cigar stores, groceries, and diners. By doing this, he established a market - not for copies of Shakespeare or Jane Austen - but for collections and book-length versions of popular magazine fiction.

===Early urban fantasy===
In 1899, Harper&#x27;s Weekly editor John Kendrick Bangs altered fantasy parameters with &quot;The Enchanted Type-Writer&quot; (a series of humorous short-stories supposedly typed by the ghost of 18th century writer James Boswell) - introducing a benign revenant in a contemporary setting. Thorne Smith was successful in 1920s-30s, especially his two &quot;Topper&quot;&quot; farces about a middle-aged banker&#x27;s adventures with a couple of ghosts (subsequently made into films, radio plays, and a 1950s television series); Smith&#x27;s posthumously-released novel &quot;The Passionate Witch&quot; was made into the 1942 comic cinema romance I Married a Witch by Rene Clair. 

Writer Charles G. Finney&#x27;s celebrated 1935 experimental novel &quot;The Circus of Dr. Lao&quot; placed mythical creatures in a contemporary setting to examine the society in a small Arizona town. Gruesome cartoons by Charles Addams began exploring the humorous side of horror in the New Yorker magazine around the same time.

Occult detective stories, such as Manly Wade Wellman&#x27;s John Thunstone stories - written originally during the 1940s -are credited by many current authors for bringing contemporary characters and American settings into the fantasy and horror genres. These early tales, however, differ from current urban fantasy - they present supernatural beings and acts as unnatural, aberrant, and a possible danger to ordinary citizens.

&quot;Unknown&quot; magazine (1939–1943) was conceived by its editor John W. Campbell as a fantasy equivalent of Campbell&#x27;s successful &quot;Astounding&quot; science fiction magazine; its stories often took place in the present and many had a thoughtful &quot;science-fictional&quot; approach. Writers such as Fritz Leiber (&quot;Smoke Ghost&quot;, published in 1941), Jack Williamson with &quot;Darker Than You Think&quot; (originally published 1940), H. L. Gold (with his &quot;Trouble with Water&quot;, published in 1939) and L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Nothing in the Rules&quot; (1939) presented ghosts, lycanthropes, gnomes, mermaids, demons and more, in a modern setting, with horrific and/or humorous results. The prolific de Camp and his writing partner, war game inventor Fletcher Pratt, also explored urban material with their stories of Harold Shea in the 1940s and Gavagan&#x27;s Bar stories in the 1950s.

The 1940s saw a number of comic ghost-movies; some of the best-known today include The Canterville Ghost (re-telling the 1887 story by Oscar Wilde), Blithe Spirit (based on Noël Coward&#x27;s hit London and Broadway play), The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (based on an R.A. Dick novel), series-fare Topper Returns, Gildersleeve&#x27;s Ghost, The Smiling Ghost, plus cartoons and short features from The Three Stooges, Olsen and Johnson, Walt Disney Productions and Looney Tunes.

===1950s-60s===
Bell, Book and Candle opened on Broadway in 1950, playing 233 performances before it went on a US tour, then played in London for several years. It was released as a film of the same name in 1958. The 1954 best-selling novel &quot;The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant&quot; details a Faustian deal with the devil in major-league professional baseball; it was made into the successful 1957 Broadway musical &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (subsequently revived several times), and then into a 1958 Hollywood film. That same year, Irish-American Leonard Wibberley published &quot;Mrs Searwood&#x27;s Secret Weapon,&quot; about an elderly British widow haunted by the ghost of a Powhatan warrior during the London Blitz. British spy-novel writers Adelaide Manning and Cyril Coles (under the pseudonym Francis Gaites, but published in the United States as by Manning Coles) produced a series of humorous novels from 1954 to 1958 placing ghostly revenants of Franco-Prussian War era into 1950s Paris and Como. Herman Cohen&#x27;s teen-horror films for American International Pictures commenced in 1957 with &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;, combining supernatural characters with the mundane popular post WW2 teen-culture. In 1959, the fantasy/sci-fi TV anthology The Twilight Zone began, after the success of its pilot &quot;The Time Element&quot; appeared as a 1958 episode of Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse.

In 1962, Ray Bradbury published the dark novel &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, which has been cited as a particular influence by writers Stephen King, R. L. Stine, and Neil Gaiman. The highly successful TV fantasy series &quot;Bewitched&quot; began its 8-year run in 1964, with its rival &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and a less-successful fantasy show &quot;My Mother the Car&quot; appearing a year later; &quot;The Addams Family&quot; based on Charles Addams New Yorker cartoons also debuted in 1964. Ira Levin&#x27;s 1967 novel Rosemary&#x27;s Baby was a best-seller and critical hit; made into a movie directed by Roman Polanski the following year. Chester Anderson&#x27;s psychedelic adventure &quot;The Butterfly Kid&quot; was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1968. Also in 1968, the English translation of Italo Calvino&#x27;s short-story collection &quot;Le cosmicomiche&quot; made his fantastic tales built around minor scientific details available to the Anglo-American appetite for the new urban fantasy.

===1970s–early 1980s===
After the success of Stephen King&#x27;s contemporary horror-story &quot;Carrie&quot; in 1973, the author introduced supernatural characters (vampires) into his next book, &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; (1976), which he has claimed is his own favorite. Retrospective reviews of King&#x27;s work note that he &quot;brought reality to genre novels&quot;, and have remarked that &quot;Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot is the main character here, a warm-up for what King would later do with his beloved fictional towns of Derry and Castle Rock. We&#x27;re given a vivid description, details and foibles, before the town is populated with a cast of characters...&quot;

Anne Rice published &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (a re-working of her own late-60s short story) in 1976 to strikingly mixed critical reviews. Incorporating many genres (horror, eroticism, fantasy, romance, historical fiction), it and its sequels established a new audience for fantasy characters in a real world. Recognizing its potential Alfred A. Knopf editor Victoria Wilson recommended a very substantial advance; later, the paperback rights cost Ballantine Books $700,000.

1972&#x27;s TV horror-film &quot;The Night Stalker&quot; spun-off a 1974 occult detective TV series &quot;.&quot; It featured a Chicago newspaper reporter uncovering and battling supernatural creatures (e.g. vampires and zombies). He was unbelieved and unappreciated, considered by his boss, colleagues, the police and the public as something between a crackpot or an insane murderer as he struggles with both real and metaphorical demons in each episode. 

Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Azazel stories about a tiny demon (less than an inch tall), most of which were written in the 1980s, take some of their urban character of his mystery stories initially published in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. Dorothy Gilman, a writer known for her genre-merging &quot;Mrs. Pollifax&quot; &quot;cozy-spy&quot; action novels, wrote &quot;The Clairvoyant Countess&quot; in 1975 which featured various forms of ESP (and wrote a sequel in 2002).

In the cinema, the re-write of Dan Aykroyd&#x27;s original 1982 science fiction comedy script for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; by Harold Ramis replaced the futuristic setting for present day New York City. This effectively enabled the film to be made, and introduced to the mainstream the idea of fantastical events taking place in a real-world setting. Two years later, &quot;Gremlins&quot; brought another batch of supernatural beings into our everyday world. At the same time another low-budget supernatural comedy success, &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; was popular enough to generate a television show, an animated cartoon, and a cinema sequel. Before its run was finished, another general-audience teen comedy with supernatural elements, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, was in production.

===1980s and 1990s===
The term began to come into its present use in the late 1970s; however, its meaning kept shifting during the 1980s and early 1990s. This development is apparent in the increased use of the term in contemporary reviews.

Terri Windling&#x27;s shared Borderlands universe, made up of a number of anthologies and novels, launched with the eponymous paperback original anthology, &quot;Borderland&quot; in 1986, followed up by &quot;Bordertown&quot;, also in 1986. The series was later touted by Neil Gaiman as &quot;one of the most important places where Urban Fantasy began&quot;. An article in Tor.com has stated that &quot;some say, Urban Fantasy was born in Bordertown,&quot; which provided &quot;young, beginning writers like Charles de Lint and Emma Bull&quot; with a platform. Emma Bull&#x27;s 1987 urban fantasy &quot;War for the Oaks&quot;, where fairy factions battle in present-day Minneapolis, also received interest and attention. Both Bull&#x27;s novel and the Borderlands books emphasized young, poor, hip protagonists. In this, they had much in common with the usual protagonist of the cyberpunk sub-genre of science fiction.

&quot;Sweet Silver Blues&quot; a 1987 novel by fantasy author Glen Cook began his Garrett P.I. series. These tales chronicled adventures of a hardboiled detective in a contemporary fantasy world, and were among the earliest to use a fantastic &quot;underworld&quot; in place of the criminals and thugs of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and their followers. Prolific author Mercedes Lackey started a series in the waning years of the 1980s with &quot;Burning Water&quot;, exploring the life of a contemporary American witch.

The Vampire Files by P.N. Elrod featured a vampire detective that begins the series by him solving his own murder. Set in Chicago in the 1930s, the 12-book series pioneered the vampire investigator role. P.N. Elrod has authored more than 25 books and edited many anthologies. She has won numerous awards for her work in establishing the UF genre.

&quot;Shadowrun&quot;, a tabletop RPG with a similar concept to the Borderlands universe appeared. Like those earlier books, &quot;Shadowrun&quot; took place in a future Earth setting (specifically 2050, in the first edition), after the reappearance of supernatural powers and beings. Players could play humans (cybernetically enhanced or otherwise), elves, dwarves or orcs, all in a dark high tech setting. The more definitely cyberpunk approach (jaundiced and gritty) of the game&#x27;s universe exerted its own influence.

Anthologist and professor. Dr. Martin H. Greenberg sparked growth in urban fantasy by commissioning established authors to write stories for his many fantasy anthologies (among them &quot;Wizards, Witches, Devils,&quot; and &quot;Faeries&quot;). The commissioned work was juxtaposed with older fiction; it frequently used supernatural elements in contemporary urban settings.

===21st century===
Several publications and writers have cited authors Laurell K. Hamilton and Kim Harrison as notable contributors to the genre. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; have recognized the longevity and influence of Hamilton&#x27;s stories, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Amazon.com&quot; have noted the work of Kim Harrison. Author Courtney Allison Moulton has cited Hamilton&#x27;s early works among her inspirations. Kelly Gay has noted Hamilton, Harrison, and Emma Bull as primary influences. Jim Butcher&#x27;s &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; series have been described by Barnes and Noble as &quot;the gold standard&quot; for the genre; one of the books from the series was nominated for the 2015 Hugo Award. N. K. Jemisin&#x27;s &quot;The City We Became&quot; features major cities acquiring sentience through human avatars; it won the 2020 BSFA Award for Best Novel and was nominated for the 2021 Hugo and 2020 Nebula Awards.

==Novels==

===Adult fiction===

While adult urban fantasy novels may stand-alone (like &quot;Mulengro&quot; by Charles de Lint or Emma Bull&#x27;s &quot;War for the Oaks&quot;), the economics of the market favor series characters, and genre-crossing allows sales along multiple lines.

Many urban-fantasy novels are told via a first-person narrative, and often feature mythological beings, romance, and female protagonists who are involved in law enforcement or vigilantism. Laurell K. Hamilton&#x27;s Anita Blake series—which follows the investigations of a supernatural Federal Marshal during paranormal cases—has been called a substantial and influential work of the genre. Kim Harrison&#x27;s Rachel Morgan novels, also regarded as inspirational works, feature a bounty-hunting &quot;witch-born&quot; demon who battles numerous supernatural foes. Multi-genre offerings combine urban fantasy with other established forms (e.g.: police procedurals, as presented in the Peter Grant stories of Ben Aaronovitch, or the Charlie Madigan series, by Kelly Gay, which explores challenges a police officer faces while trying to balance her paranormal cases with life as a single mother).

In addition to books which present largely independent characters, certain stories feature men and women who are regularly partnered on adventures—often with an underlying romantic element. The Jaz Parks series, by Jennifer Rardin, follows the titular Central Intelligence Agency operative and her vampire boss as they combat supernatural threats to national security. Jocelynn Drake&#x27;s &quot;Dark Days&quot; novels follow a vampire named Mira and a vampire hunter named Danaus, who work together to protect their people from a mutual enemy. &quot;Night Huntress&quot;, a series by Jeaniene Frost, centers on a half-vampire named Catherine and a vampire bounty hunter called Bones, who gradually become lovers while battling the undead.

===Teen fiction===

In contrast to the &quot;professional heroes&quot; found in adult urban-fantasy novels, many novels aimed at young adult audiences follow inexperienced protagonists who are unexpectedly drawn into paranormal struggles. Amidst these conflicts, characters often gain allies, find romance, and, in some cases, develop or discover supernatural abilities of their own. In Kelley Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;The Darkest Powers&quot; series, a group of teens with paranormal talents go on the run while fleeing from a persistent band of scientists. &quot;Gone&quot;, by Michael Grant, follows an isolated town in which adults have mysteriously disappeared, leaving a society of super-powered children behind. In &quot;Unearthly&quot;, by Cynthia Hand, a girl discovers that she is part angel and gifted with superhuman abilities, leading her to seek out her purpose on Earth.
The &quot;Immortals&quot; series, by Alyson Noël, follows a girl who gains special abilities after recovering from an accident, and also grows close to a mysterious new boy at her school. Love triangles also play a prominent part in these and several other urban-fantasy novels. Coming-of-age themes and teen &#x27;voices&#x27; also often distinguish young-adult urban fantasy from adult books in the genre. Bruce Coville and Jane Yolen collaborated on &quot;Armageddon Summer&quot; which places a standard teen romance in the middle of an imagined apocalyptic cult.

Boarding schools are a common setting in teen urban fantasy. &quot;Rampant&quot;, by Diana Peterfreund, follows a group of young women at a cloisters as they train to fight killer unicorns. The &quot;House of Night&quot; series, by P. C. and Kristin Cast, presents a school where future vampires are disciplined while on the path to transformation, during which several romantic conflicts and other clashes ensue. Claudia Gray&#x27;s &quot;Evernight&quot; novels center on a mysterious academy, where a romantic bond develops between a girl born to vampires, and a boy who hunts them. &quot;Fallen&quot;, by Lauren Kate, revolves around a student named Luce who finds herself drawn to a boy named Daniel, unaware that he is a fallen angel who shares a history with her. Other series, such as Carrie Jones&#x27;s &quot;Need&quot;, have characters moving to new locations but attending public schools while discovering mysterious occurrences elsewhere in their towns.

===Juvenile fiction===
A helping of the fantastic is often an element in children&#x27;s literature, but the two major strands of urban fantasy are well-represented in particular.

The &quot;hidden-world&quot; focuses on stories and characters taking place in a fully-realized domain which operates secretly but simultaneously to the world with which we are familiar. An outstanding example are the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books of J. K. Rowling - where our own (&quot;muggle&quot;) world is unaware of an entire universe of wizards and magical creatures; and intersections of these domains provide plot material and character dimensionality for the action taking place primarily in the magic universe - and so being a type of &quot;high-fantasy&quot;.

On the other hand, &quot;magical charm&quot; stories operate mostly in the mundane universe, but where a spell or token provides plot-interest. The protagonist of Robert Lawson&#x27;s 1945 &quot;Mr. Wilmer&quot; works as a clerk for a big New York City company - but suddenly one morning he can speak with and understand animals. In the magical stories of Edward Eager, groups of children are granted wishes or transported through time by invoking spells. This makes the stories a variety of &quot;low-fantasy&quot;.

Possibly the best-known urban fantasy series for children are P. L. Travers&#x27; low-fantasy Mary Poppins stories, set in London between the World Wars. As well as eight books, there have been several film and stage adaptations. The high-fantasy Harry Potter phenomenon may soon be in position to overtake Poppins in sales, but not longevity.

===Paranormal romance===
In an online commentary, author Jeannie Holmes described differences between urban fantasy and paranormal romance:
===Media tie-ins===
Use of other forms of media has become a common part of the creation and promotion of urban-fantasy works.

====Music====

Several urban-fantasy authors cite music as an inspiration. Certain writers recommend songs or playlists on their official websites, including Courtney Allison Moulton, Jaye Wells, and Sarah J. Maas, who couple their recommendations with links to music-providing services. Publishers have also used music for book trailers, including the trailer for Carrie Jones&#x27;s &quot;Captivate&quot;, which features the work of songwriter Derek Daisey.

Original music is also produced. In 2010, musicians Alexandra Monir, Michael Bearden, and Heather Holley (a songwriter for Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Stripped&quot;) collaborated to create songs for Monir&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Timeless&quot;.

====Video====
Book trailers are often used to promote urban-fantasy novels. Publishers such as HarperCollins also produce regular video interviews with debuting authors.

====Comics and manga====
Adaptations of urban-fantasy novels have appeared in comic books and manga. Among the tales to be adapted are Laurell K. Hamilton&#x27;s Anita Blake series, Patricia Briggs&#x27;s Mercy Thompson stories, and Melissa Marr&#x27;s &quot;Wicked Lovely&quot;.

==Film and television==
Works of urban fantasy have been adapted to or have originated in film and television. Aside from popular ghost and horror films from the 1930s-60s, well-known examples include the 1992 series &quot;&quot; and the TV adaptation of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, which is regarded as a seminal work of the genre.

Certain staples of urban fantasy novels are also present in television shows. The concept of peaceful coexistence with paranormal beings is explored in the 1996 series &quot;&quot;, which focuses on secret vampire clans in San Francisco. Works such as &quot;Witchblade&quot; present the more common matter of a protagonist attempting to protect citizens.

While urban-fantasy novels are often centered on heroines, television programs have regularly featured both genders in leading roles. Shows such as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Dresden Files&quot;, &quot;Forever Knight&quot;, &quot;Grimm&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot;, and &quot;Supernatural&quot; are based around male protagonists, while other programs, including &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, and &quot;Witchblade&quot;, focus largely on female protagonists.

==Video games==
While most fantasy video games take place in science fantasy or high fantasy settings, the subgenre of urban fantasy has a significant niche in the video game media market.

Many urban fantasy video games such as &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Tokyo Xanadu&quot;, &quot;The World Ends with You&quot; series, the &quot;Shadowrun&quot; series, the &quot;Dishonored&quot; series, and the &quot;Mother&quot; series feature urban settings with magical elements&quot;.&quot;

Urban fantasy video games often include characters from folklores and religions in modern contexts. Games such as &quot;The Wolf Among Us, Stray Gods, Folklore, Dark, Coffee Talk,&quot; the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series, the &quot;Bayonetta&quot; series, the series, the &quot;Yo-kai Watch series&quot; are heavily inspired by folklore and religion. Other urban fantasy video games put a modern interpretation on other fantasy media. The &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; series is based on &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; and &quot;Lies of P&quot; is based on &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio.&quot;

==Authors==

The following is an incomplete list of notable authors of urban fantasy.

<text>The Burid dynasty (Arabic: الدولة البورية : Al-Dawla al-Buria) or the Emirate of Damascus (Arabic: إمارة دمشق : Imarat Dimashq) was a Sunni Muslim dynasty of Oghuz Turkic origin which ruled over the Emirate of Damascus in the early 12th century, as subjects of the Seljuk Empire.

==History==

The first Burid ruler, Toghtekin, began as a servant to the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, Duqaq. Following Duqaq&#x27;s death in 1104, he seized the city for himself.

The dynasty was named after Toghtekin&#x27;s son, Taj al-Muluk Buri. The Burids gained recognition from the Abbasid caliphate in return for considerable gifts. In return, the caliphate did not interfere in the emirate.

The Burids ruled the city until 1154, when it was taken by the ruler of Aleppo, Nur ed-Din, founder of the Zengid dynasty.

The Burids lost to the Crusaders in the battle of Marj al-Saffar (1126) but were able to prevent the Second Crusade from capturing Damascus.

<text>George Mikes ( ; , ; 15 February 1912 – 30 August 1987) was a Hungarian-born British journalist, humorist and writer, best known for his humorous commentaries on various countries.

== Life and career ==
George Mikes (Hungarian: ) was born in 1912, in the small town of Siklós, in the southwest of Hungary. His father, Alfréd Mikes, was a successful lawyer, a profession he wanted his son to follow. Mikes graduated in Budapest in 1933; he studied law and received his doctorate at Budapest University, after that he worked as a lawyer but at the same time he became a journalist and started to work for (&quot;Morning&quot;), a Budapest newspaper. For a short while he was the columnist of for (&quot;Theatre Life&quot;), another newspaper in Budapest.

In 1938 Mikes became the London correspondent for two Hungarian newspapers, and (&quot;8 o&#x27;clock News&quot;) and he worked for the former until 1940. The experience of the German Jewish refugees coming to his home in Hungary for help after 1933 had left an abiding impression upon him. So in 1938, when Mikes had originally been sent to London to cover the Munich Crisis and expected to stay for only a couple of weeks, just one year before the outbreak of World War II he decided not to return to Hungary, and instead remained in England. He worked for the BBC&#x27;s Hungarian Service from 1939 onwards, interrupted only by his internment as an enemy alien on the Isle of Man in 1940.

Living in exile in England, he broadcast to Hungary for the BBC during World War II, and also collaborated with the Hungarian emigration, and wrote political cabaret for the London Podium, a Hungarian theatre in London at that time, in collaboration with the Hungarian born composer Matyas Seiber. From 1939 he also made documentaries for the BBC Hungarian section, at first as a freelance correspondent and, from 1950, as an employee. He was naturalised as a British citizen in 1946. In 1956, he went back to Hungary to cover the Hungarian Revolution for BBC TV. From 1975 until his death on 30 August 1987 he also worked for the Hungarian section of Radio Free Europe.

He was president of the London branch of PEN, and a member of the Garrick Club.

Mikes wrote in both Hungarian and English, for &quot;The Observer&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;Encounter&quot;, , , the Viennese Hungarian-language , and .

His friends included the Hungarian writer Arthur Koestler, whose biography Mikes wrote (&quot;Arthur Koestler; the story of a friendship&quot;); J. B. Priestley; academic Doireann MacDermott; and André Deutsch, whose publishing house promoted Mikes as a writer.

He married twice and had a son, Martin, by his first marriage, and a daughter, Judith, by his second. He died in London on 30 August 1987. On 15 September 1991, a memorial plaque was unveiled at his childhood home.

== Publications ==
His first book, published in 1945, was &quot;We Were There To Escape – the true story of a Jugoslav officer&quot; about life in prisoner-of-war camps. &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; praised the book for the humour it showed in parts, which led him to write his most famous satiric book, &quot;How to be an Alien&quot;, which proved a great success in post-war Britain in 1946. This book poked gentle fun at the English, including a one-line chapter on sex: &quot;Continental people have sex lives; the English have hot-water bottles.&quot; In his subsequent books Mikes blended local jokes into his own humour, dealt with (among others) Japan (&quot;The Land of the Rising Yen&quot;), Israel (&quot;Milk and Honey&quot;, &quot;The Prophet Motive&quot;), the US (&quot;How to Scrape Skies&quot;), the United Nations (&quot;How to Unite Nations&quot;), Australia (&quot;Boomerang&quot;), the British again (&quot;How to be Inimitable&quot; and &quot;How to be Decadent&quot;, both collected with &quot;How to be an Alien&quot; as &quot;How to be a Brit&quot;), and South America (&quot;How to Tango&quot;). Other subjects include God (&quot;How to be God&quot;), his cat (&quot;Tsi-Tsa&quot;), wealth (&quot;How to be Poor&quot;) and philosophy (&quot;How to be a Guru&quot;).

Apart from his commentaries, he wrote humorous fiction (&quot;Mortal Passion&quot;; &quot;The Spy Who Died of Boredom&quot;) and contributed to the satirical television series &quot;That Was The Week That Was&quot;.

He wrote his ironic autobiography with the title &quot;How to be Seventy&quot;, published in 1982.

Every now and then Mikes ventured into the territory of serious literature: his serious writing included a book about the Hungarian secret police and he narrated a BBC television report of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

According to , himself a Hungarian immigrant writer, Mikes&#x27; favourite comic device was to place himself as an inveterate yet vulnerable traveller; an ardent rationalist with European values, where he discovers national pretensions behind proud phraseology. Thus, he was able to flesh out national stereotypes with comic characteristics.

Mikes wrote over forty books, thirty-five of them humorous; however, in some way, it was a pity that his &quot;How to be an Alien&quot; was a long-lasting best seller. It pushed him into the category of critic who was viewed with benign fondness but not considered a serious thinker.

In the preface to the 24th impression of his book &quot;How to be an Alien&quot;, he reflects on the book&#x27;s success:
Since then I have actually written about a dozen books but I might as well have never written anything else. I remained the author of &quot;How to be an Alien&quot; even after I had published a collection of serious essays.

<text>The Ithaca Journal is a daily morning broadsheet newspaper published in Ithaca, New York. It is locally edited and printed in Johnson City, New York, and publishes Monday through Saturday. It has been owned by Gannett since 1912.

==Publications==

===Daily newspaper===
&quot;The Ithaca Journal&quot; publishes a daily morning newspaper Monday through Saturday. No edition is printed on Sundays.

Starting on March 27, 2006, &quot;The Ithaca Journal&quot; included four sections Monday through Friday.

The first section includes local, national and international news. The second section includes several pages of city and county news and sports. The third section, which was launched March 27, 2006, is called Life. The front of this section includes a rotating selection of features:

*Mondays: Food and Personal Finance
*Tuesdays: Outdoors &amp; Recreation and Family
*Wednesdays: Science &amp; Environment
*Thursdays: Health
*Fridays: House &amp; Garden

In addition, Life also includes an Arts &amp; Entertainment page that includes entertainment and celebrity news, TV listings and Amy Dickinson&#x27;s advice column. There is also a full page of comics and puzzles. Business and personal finance news appears on a page called Dollars &amp; Sense.

The fourth section is entirely classified advertising. On Saturdays, the classified ads expand to two sections.

==Offices==
&quot;The Ithaca Journal&quot; is located on West State Street in downtown Ithaca, New York. &quot;The Journal&quot;″s offices spread over two buildings, the newspaper&#x27;s original building and the neighboring Greenstate Building.

The newsroom is located on the second floor of the original building with various administrative offices on the first floor. The first floor of Greenstate building houses the newspaper&#x27;s public lobby as well as the advertising offices.

Much of the newspaper&#x27;s general administrative operations are handled from the Binghamton, New York, offices of the &quot;Press &amp; Sun Bulletin&quot;.

Behind the original building, on Green Street, is the newspaper&#x27;s old press facility. This press has been unused since June 10, 2006 when printing was transferred to the Gannett Central New York Production Facility.

===Ticket and Cortland Ticket===
On Thursdays a tabloid-sized insert called &quot;Ticket&quot; is included in &quot;The Ithaca Journal&quot;. &quot;Ticket&quot; includes local arts and entertainment news and events calendar. A similar publication, &quot;Cortland Ticket&quot;, is included in newspapers sold in the Cortland, New York, area on Fridays.

===Buzz===
&quot;The Ithaca Journal&quot; produces a youth-oriented tabloid-sized publication called &quot;Buzz&quot; every week. The publication is distributed at no cost at retail locations and vending machines throughout the area and features stories of interest to a younger audience as well as an events calendar. &quot;Buzz&quot; is also distributed in the markets of &quot;The Ithaca Journal&#x27;s&quot; sister publications, the Binghamton &quot;Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin&quot; and Elmira &quot;Star-Gazette&quot;.

==History==
Founded in 1815 as the &quot;Seneca Republican&quot;, it was renamed &quot;The Ithaca Journal&quot; in 1823. According to its website, the first daily edition of paper was published in 1870 and its offices are housed in the same building it has occupied since 1905.

&quot;The Journal&quot; was purchased by Frank E. Gannett in 1912, thereby becoming the second local newspaper of what would later become the media conglomerate Gannett Co, Inc. It merged with the &quot;Daily News&quot; in 1919 and officially adopted the name &quot;The Ithaca Journal-News&quot;, although it is published under the name &quot;The Ithaca Journal&quot;.

Among its stars were Kenneth Van Sickle, the long-time sports editor who had a popular column for decades, covering everything from Cornell University and Ithaca College to high schools to local recreational sports.

The newspaper in 1985, under Managing Editor Joseph Junod, won Best of Gannett for Sports Coverage for its weekly Softball magazine. At that time, the Journal also was home to three photographers, whose work was noted throughout Gannett and the newspaper industry.

In May 1996, &quot;The Journal&quot; switched to a morning printing and distribution schedule after many years as an afternoon daily. Until that point, the newspaper run by Cornell University students, &quot;The Cornell Daily Sun&quot; had been the only morning daily paper in the city.

On June 12, 2006, the newspaper&#x27;s printing facilities were relocated to the Gannett Central New York Production Facility in Johnson City, New York, located outside of Binghamton, New York. This new facility also houses the printing facilities for the Binghamton &quot;Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin&quot; and &quot;Elmira Star-Gazette&quot;, both daily newspapers owned by Gannett.

Following this relocation, &quot;The Ithaca Journal&#x27;s&quot; existing building will be renovated to include expanded office space.

In late 2006, &quot;The Ithaca Journal&quot; laid off some of its Ithaca-based circulation, marketing and advertising staff. The newspaper&#x27;s circulation and marketing needs are now managed out of the Binghamton office.

By June 2020, the newspaper&#x27;s local staff was down to just a single reporter: Matt Steecker. This has resulted in days with no news from Ithaca. Instead, the newspaper uses content from Gannett properties in Binghamton and Elmira to fill the paper and website.

== Pulitzer ==
&quot;The Journal&quot; was awarded a Pulitzer Prize special citation in 1964 for meritorious public service.

== Criticism ==
&quot;The Journal&quot; has been frequently criticized throughout its history as pro-war and pro-corporate. Critics have pointed out that the newspaper strongly supported the Vietnam War, headlining an editorial in 1967 &quot;U.S. Troops Must Stay in Vietnam,&quot; and condemned protests of the first Persian Gulf War as &quot;unrealistic&quot; in 1991. Prior to World War II, &quot;The Journal&quot;, as with many American newspapers of the era, praised Europe&#x27;s dictators. &quot;No objective critic can fail to see that, viewed by the practical standard, [Fascism] has been, on the whole, a success,&quot; pronounced a 1932 editorial.

Nevertheless, the paper is not immune to criticism from the right; in recent years, particular attention has been paid to left-leaning editorial page editor John Carberry. &quot;The Journal&quot; has also consistently endorsed Democratic Party candidates for federal offices in recent years.

In its downsizing, &quot;The Journal&quot; has eliminated its high school sports staff, relying entirely on staff from Binghamton and Elmira newspapers for Ithaca-area high school coverage.

<text>In chemistry, a reaction mechanism is the step by step sequence of elementary reactions by which overall chemical reaction occurs.

A chemical mechanism is a theoretical conjecture that tries to describe in detail what takes place at each stage of an overall chemical reaction. The detailed steps of a reaction are not observable in most cases. The conjectured mechanism is chosen because it is thermodynamically feasible and has experimental support in isolated intermediates (see next section) or other quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the reaction. It also describes each reactive intermediate, activated complex, and transition state, which bonds are broken (and in what order), and which bonds are formed (and in what order). A complete mechanism must also explain the reason for the reactants and catalyst used, the stereochemistry observed in reactants and products, all products formed and the amount of each. 
The electron or arrow pushing method is often used in illustrating a reaction mechanism; for example, see the illustration of the mechanism for benzoin condensation in the following examples section.
Mechanisms also are of interest in inorganic chemistry. A often quoted mechanistic experiment involved the reaction of the labile hexaaquo chromous reductant with the exchange inert pentammine cobalt(III) chloride.
==Reaction intermediates==
Reaction intermediates are chemical species, often unstable and short-lived. They can, however, sometimes be isolated. They are neither reactants nor products of the overall chemical reaction, but temporary products and/or reactants in the mechanism&#x27;s reaction steps. Reaction intermediates are often confused with the transition state. The transition states are, in contrast, fleeting, high-energy species that cannot be isolated. The kinetics (relative rates of the reaction steps and the rate equation for the overall reaction) are discussed in terms of the energy required for the conversion of the reactants to the proposed transition states (molecular states that correspond to maxima on the reaction coordinates, and to saddle points on the potential energy surface for the reaction).

==Chemical kinetics==
Information about the mechanism of a reaction is often provided by analyzing chemical kinetics to determine the reaction order in each reactant.

Illustrative is the oxidation of carbon monoxide by nitrogen dioxide:
:CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO

The rate law for this reaction is:
formula_1
This form shows that the rate-determining step does not involve CO. Instead, the slow step involves two molecules of NO2. A possible mechanism for the overall reaction that explains the rate law is:
:2 NO2 → NO3 + NO (slow)
:NO3 + CO → NO2 + CO2 (fast)

Each step is called an elementary step, and each has its own rate law and molecularity. The sum of the elementary steps gives the net reaction.

When determining the overall rate law for a reaction, the slowest step is the step that determines the reaction rate. Because the first step (in the above reaction) is the slowest step, it is the rate-determining step. Because it involves the collision of two NO2 molecules, it is a bimolecular reaction with a rate formula_2 which obeys the rate law formula_3.

Other reactions may have mechanisms of several consecutive steps. In organic chemistry, the reaction mechanism for the benzoin condensation, put forward in 1903 by A. J. Lapworth, was one of the first proposed reaction mechanisms.
A chain reaction is an example of a complex mechanism, in which the propagation steps form a closed cycle.
In a chain reaction, the intermediate produced in one step generates an intermediate in another step.
Intermediates are called chain carriers. Sometimes, the chain carriers are radicals, they can be ions as well. In nuclear fission they are neutrons.

Chain reactions have several steps, which may include:

# Chain initiation: this can be by thermolysis (heating the molecules) or photolysis (absorption of light) leading to the breakage of a bond.
# Propagation: a chain carrier makes another carrier.
# Branching: one carrier makes more than one carrier.
# Retardation: a chain carrier may react with a product reducing the rate of formation of the product. It makes another chain carrier, but the product concentration is reduced.
# Chain termination: radicals combine and the chain carriers are lost.
# Inhibition: chain carriers are removed by processes other than termination, such as by forming radicals.

Even though all these steps can appear in one chain reaction, the minimum necessary ones are Initiation, propagation, and termination.

An example of a simple chain reaction is the thermal decomposition of acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) to methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO). The experimental reaction order is 3/2, which can be explained by a &quot;Rice-Herzfeld mechanism&quot;.

This reaction mechanism for acetaldehyde has 4 steps with rate equations for each step :

# Initiation : CH3CHO → •CH3 + •CHO (Rate=k1 [CH3CHO])
# Propagation: CH3CHO + •CH3 → CH4 + CH3CO• (Rate=k2 [CH3CHO][•CH3])
# Propagation: CH3CO• → •CH3 + CO (Rate=k3 [CH3CO•])
# Termination: •CH3 + •CH3 → CH3CH3 (Rate=k4 [•CH3]2)

For the overall reaction, the rates of change of the concentration of the intermediates •CH3 and CH3CO• are zero, according to the steady-state approximation, which is used to account for the rate laws of chain reactions.

d[•CH3]/dt = k1[CH3CHO] – k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] + k3[CH3CO•] - 2k4[•CH3]2 = 0

and d[CH3CO•]/dt = k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] – k3[CH3CO•] = 0

The sum of these two equations is k1[CH3CHO] – 2 k4[•CH3]2 = 0. This may be solved to find the steady-state concentration of •CH3 radicals as [•CH3] = (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]1/2.

It follows that the rate of formation of CH4 is d[CH4]/dt = k2[•CH3][CH3CHO] = k2 (k1 / 2k4)1/2 [CH3CHO]3/2

Thus the mechanism explains the observed rate expression, for the principal products CH4 and CO. The exact rate law may be even more complicated, there are also minor products such as acetone (CH3COCH3) and propanal (CH3CH2CHO).

==Other experimental methods to determine mechanism==
Many experiments that suggest the possible sequence of steps in a reaction mechanism have been designed, including:

* measurement of the effect of temperature (Arrhenius equation) to determine the activation energy
* spectroscopic observation of reaction intermediates
* determination of the stereochemistry of products, for example in nucleophilic substitution reactions
* measurement of the effect of isotopic substitution on the reaction rate
* for reactions in solution, measurement of the effect of pressure on the reaction rate to determine the volume change on formation of the activated complex
* for reactions of ions in solution, measurement of the effect of ionic strength on the reaction rate
* direct observation of the activated complex by pump-probe spectroscopy
* infrared chemiluminescence to detect vibrational excitation in the products
* electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
* crossover experiments.

==Theoretical modeling==
A correct reaction mechanism is an important part of accurate predictive modeling. For many combustion and plasma systems, detailed mechanisms are not available or require development.

Even when information is available, identifying and assembling the relevant data from a variety of sources, reconciling discrepant values and extrapolating to different conditions can be a difficult process without expert help. Rate constants or thermochemical data are often not available in the literature, so computational chemistry techniques or group additivity methods must be used to obtain the required parameters.

Computational chemistry methods can also be used to calculate potential energy surfaces for reactions and determine probable mechanisms.

==Molecularity==
Molecularity in chemistry is the number of colliding molecular entities that are involved in a single reaction step.
* A reaction step involving one molecular entity is called unimolecular.
* A reaction step involving two molecular entities is called bimolecular.
* A reaction step involving three molecular entities is called trimolecular or termolecular.

In general, reaction steps involving more than three molecular entities do not occur, because is statistically improbable in terms of Maxwell distribution to find such a transition state.

<doc id="607532" wikidata="Q17016140" url="?curid=607532" title="How to be an Alien">
<text>How to be an Alien is a humorous book by George Mikes, illustrated by Nicolas Bentley and published in 1946. It was Mikes&#x27; second book and is the most famous of the 44 he wrote. It is a classic of British humour and by its 32nd impression in 1966 had sold over 300,000 copies. It pokes gentle fun at the English and their relationship with foreigners, &quot;alien&quot; meaning in this context any non-English person. The book is characterised by much humour, affection and a total lack of rancour or bitterness. Mikes, an immigrant from Hungary, demonstrated not only his knowledge of English society but an insight into the English language.

== Synopsis ==
The book is in two parts. The first part, &quot;How to be a General Alien&quot;, deals with such important English topics as the weather, tea, how not to be clever (since it is considered bad manners), how to compromise, and queueing (according to Mikes, the national passion). The chapter entitled &quot;Sex&quot; is in its entirety as follows.
Continental people have sex lives: the English have hot water bottles.
The second part, &quot;How to be a Particular Alien&quot;, describes particular occupations from Bloomsbury intellectual to bus driver, finishing with how to be a naturalised citizen, which includes the eating of porridge for breakfast, and alleging that you like it.

Mikes subsequently wrote &quot;How to be Inimitable&quot; (1960) and &quot;How to be Decadent&quot; (1977). All three books were published in one volume in 1984 as &quot;How to be a Brit&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
A television programme based on the book, &quot;How to Be an Alien&quot;, was broadcast in 1964, featuring Frank Muir and Denis Norden, with the voices of Ronnie Barker and June Whitfield. The book was adopted for English language teaching in the Penguin Readers series.

==Editions==
*1946 First edition: André Deutsch (UK) hardback with illustrations by Nicolas Bentley
*1966 Penguin Books (paperback)
*1999 &quot;How to Be an Alien&quot; (Penguin ELT Simplified Readers: Level 3: Pre-Intermediate) (Paperback)

<doc id="607536" wikidata="Q183157" url="?curid=607536" title="The Brothers Karamazov">
<text>The Brothers Karamazov (, &quot;Brát&#x27;ya Karamázovy&quot;, ), also translated as The Karamazov Brothers, is the last novel by Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. Dostoevsky spent nearly two years writing &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, which was published as a serial in &quot;The Russian Messenger&quot; from January 1879 to November 1880. Dostoevsky died less than four months after its publication. It has been acclaimed as one of the supreme achievements in world literature.

Set in 19th-century Russia, &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; is a passionate philosophical novel that discusses questions of God, free will, and morality. It has also been described as a theological drama dealing with problems of faith, doubt, and reason in the context of a modernizing Russia, with a plot that revolves around the subject of patricide. Dostoevsky composed much of the novel in Staraya Russa, which inspired the main setting.

==Background==

Although Dostoevsky began his first notes for &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; in April 1878, the novel incorporated elements and themes from an earlier unfinished project he had begun in 1869 entitled &quot;The Life of a Great Sinner&quot;. Another unfinished project, &quot;Drama in Tobolsk&quot; (Драма. В Тобольске), is considered to be the first draft of the first chapter of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;. Dated 13 September 1874, it tells of a fictional murder in Staraya Russa committed by a &quot;praporshchik&quot; named Dmitry Ilynskov (based on a real soldier from Omsk), who is thought to have murdered his father. It goes on to note that the father&#x27;s body was suddenly discovered in a pit under a house. The similarly unfinished &quot;Sorokoviny&quot; (Сороковины), dated 1 August 1875, is reflected in book IX, chapter 3–5 and book XI, chapter nine.

In the October 1877 &quot;Writer&#x27;s Diary&quot; article &quot;To the Reader&quot;, Dostoevsky mentions a &quot;literary work that has imperceptibly and involuntarily been taking shape within me over these two years of publishing the &quot;Diary&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Diary&quot; covered a multitude of themes and issues, some of which would be explored in greater depth in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;. These include patricide, law and order, and a variety of social problems.

The writing of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; was altered by a personal tragedy: in May 1878, Dostoevsky&#x27;s 3-year-old son Alyosha died of epilepsy, a condition inherited from his father. The novelist&#x27;s grief is apparent throughout the book. Dostoevsky named the hero Alyosha, as well as imbuing him with qualities that he sought and most admired. His loss is also reflected in the story of Captain Snegiryov and his young son Ilyusha.

The death of his son brought Dostoevsky to the Optina Monastery later that year. There he found inspiration for several aspects of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, though at the time he intended to write a novel about childhood instead. Parts of the biographical section of Zosima&#x27;s life are based on &quot;The Life of the Elder Leonid&quot;, a text he found at Optina.

==Major characters==

=== Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov ===

Fyodor Pavlovich, a 55-year-old sensualist and compulsive liar, is the father of three sons—Dmitri, Ivan and Alexei—from two marriages. He is rumored to have also fathered an illegitimate son, Pavel Fyodorovich Smerdyakov, whom he employs as his servant. Fyodor Pavlovich takes no interest in any of his sons at their birth, who are, as a result, raised apart from each other and their father. The relationship between Fyodor and his adult sons drives much of the plot in the novel.

=== Dmitri Fyodorovich Karamazov ===
Dmitri Fyodorovich (often referred to as Mitya) is Fyodor Karamazov&#x27;s eldest son and the only offspring of his first marriage, with Adelaida Ivanovna Miusov. Dmitri is considered to be a sensualist, like his father, and regularly indulges in alcoholism and carousing. Dmitri is brought into contact with his family when he finds himself in need of his inheritance, which he believes is being withheld by his father. He was engaged to be married to Katerina Ivanovna, but breaks that off after falling in love with Grushenka. Dmitri&#x27;s relationship with his father is the most volatile of the brothers, escalating to violence as he and his father begin fighting over his inheritance and Grushenka. While he maintains a relationship with Ivan, he is closest to his younger brother Alyosha, referring to him as his &quot;cherub&quot;.

The character of Dmitri was initially inspired by a convict, D.I. Ilyinsky, whom Dostoevsky met while in prison in Siberia. Ilyinsky, who is described in Dostoevsky&#x27;s memoir-novel &quot;Notes from the House of the Dead&quot; as &quot;always in the liveliest, merriest spirits&quot;, was in prison for murdering his father in order to obtain his inheritance, although he always steadfastly maintained his innocence. He was later freed after another man confessed to the crime.

=== Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov ===
Ivan Fyodorovich (sometimes also referred to as Vanya) is the 24-year-old middle son, and the first from Fyodor Pavlovich&#x27;s second marriage. Ivan is reserved and aloof, but also intellectually brilliant. His dictum &quot;if there is no God, everything is lawful&quot; is a recurring motif in the novel. At first, Ivan seems not to have much time for his brother Alyosha, but later their bond and mutual affection deepens. He finds his father repulsive, and also has a strong antipathy towards Dmitri. Fyodor Pavlovich tells Alyosha that he fears Ivan more than he fears Dmitri. Ivan falls in love with Katerina Ivanovna, but their intimacy develops in the shadow of her prior connection to Dmitri, and her ambivalence is a source of torment to him.

Some of the most acclaimed passages of the novel involve Ivan, including the chapters &quot;Rebellion&quot; and &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot; from Book V, and the three conversations with Smerdyakov and the subsequent chapter &quot;Ivan&#x27;s nightmare of the devil&quot; in Book XI. Book V, entitled &quot;Pro and Contra&quot;, is primarily about &quot;the inner debate taking place in Ivan between his recognition of the moral sublimity of the Christian ideal and his outrage against a universe of pain and suffering.&quot; Ivan&#x27;s rejection of God is posited in terms of the Christian value of compassion—the value that Dostoevsky himself (through the character of Prince Myshkin in &quot;The Idiot&quot;) called &quot;the chief and perhaps the only law of all human existence.&quot; Thus Ivan&#x27;s rejection of God is justified by the very principle at the heart of Christianity. For Ivan the absurdity of all human history is proven by the senselessness of the suffering of children: if reason or rationality is the measure, God&#x27;s world &quot;cannot&quot; be accepted. All the examples Ivan gives of horrors perpetrated against children were taken by Dostoevsky from actual newspaper accounts and historical sources.

=== Alexei Fyodorovich Karamazov ===

Alexei Fyodorovich (often referred to as Alyosha) is, at age 20, the youngest of the brothers. He is the second child of Fyodor Pavlovich&#x27;s second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, and is thus Ivan&#x27;s full brother. The narrator identifies him as the hero of the novel in the opening chapter, as does the author in the preface. At the outset of the events, Alyosha is a novice in the local Russian Orthodox monastery. His faith is in contrast to his brother Ivan&#x27;s atheism. The Elder, Father Zosima, who is a father figure and spiritual guide to Alyosha throughout the book, sends him into the world, where he becomes involved with the extreme personalities and fraught relationships in his family and elsewhere. At all times he acts as a compassionate and insightful peace maker, and is loved by virtually everyone.

In creating the character of Alyosha, Dostoevsky was in large part addressing himself to the contemporary Russian radical youth, as a positive alternative to the atheistic approach to justice and attainment of the good. Alyosha embodies the same aspiration to a society governed by goodness and compassion that is contained in the Socialist ideal, but not divorced from faith in God, from faith in the immortality of the soul in God, or from the Orthodox Christian tradition in Russia.

=== Pavel Fyodorovich Smerdyakov ===
Pavel Fyodorovich Smerdyakov is the son of &quot;Reeking Lizaveta&quot;, a mute woman of the street who died alone giving birth to the child in Fyodor Pavlovich&#x27;s bathhouse: the name &quot;Smerdyakov&quot; means &quot;son of the reeking one&quot;. He is rumored to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovich. He was brought up by Fyodor Pavlovich&#x27;s trusted servant Grigory Vasilievich and his wife Marfa. Grigory tutored him and attempted to give him religious instruction, but Smerdyakov responded with ingratitude and derision. On one occasion Grigory had struck him violently across the face: a week later Smerdyakov had his first epileptic seizure. The narrator notes that as a child, Smerdyakov was fond of hanging cats and giving them ritualistic burials. Grigory told him: &quot;You&#x27;re not human. You&#x27;re the spawn of the mildew on the bathhouse wall, that&#x27;s who you are&quot;—a remark for which Smerdyakov never forgave him. Smerdyakov becomes part of the Karamazov household as a servant, working as Fyodor Pavlovich&#x27;s lackey and cook. Generally contemptuous of others, Smerdyakov greatly admires Ivan, shares his atheism, and is influenced by his dictum that &quot;everything is lawful&quot;. Despite his evident shrewdness, other characters—particularly Ivan, Dmitri and Fyodor Pavlovich—underestimate his intelligence.

=== Agrafena Alexandrovna Svetlova ===
Agrafena Alexandrovna Svetlova, usually referred to as &#x27;Grushenka&#x27;, is a beautiful and fiery 22-year-old woman with an uncanny charm for men. In her youth she was jilted by a Polish officer and subsequently came under the protection of a tyrannical miser. The episode leaves Grushenka with an urge for independence and control of her life. Grushenka inspires complete admiration and lust in both Fyodor and Dmitri Karamazov. Their rivalry for her affection becomes the main focus of their conflict, a state of affairs that Grushenka is happy to take advantage of for her own satisfaction and amusement. Belatedly, she realizes that she truly loves Dmitri, and becomes ashamed of her cruelty. Her growing friendship with Alyosha leads her toward a path of spiritual redemption, and hidden qualities of gentleness and generosity emerge, though her fiery temper and pride remain intact.

=== Katerina Ivanovna Verkhovtseva ===
Katerina Ivanovna (sometimes referred to as Katya) is Dmitri&#x27;s beautiful fiancée, despite his open forays with Grushenka. Her engagement to Dmitri is chiefly a matter of pride on both their parts, Dmitri having bailed her father out of a debt. Katerina is extremely proud and seeks to act as a noble martyr. Because of this, she cannot bring herself to act on her love for Ivan, and constantly creates moral barriers between him and herself.

=== Father Zosima, the Elder ===
Father Zosima is an Elder and spiritual advisor (&quot;starets&quot;) in the town monastery and Alyosha&#x27;s teacher. He is something of a celebrity among the townspeople for his reputed prophetic and healing abilities. His spiritual status inspires both admiration and jealousy among his fellow monks. Zosima provides a refutation to Ivan&#x27;s atheistic arguments and helps to explain Alyosha&#x27;s character. Zosima&#x27;s teachings shape the way Alyosha deals with the young boys he meets in the Ilyusha storyline.

Dostoevsky&#x27;s intent with the character of Zosima (as with Alyosha) was to portray the Church as a positive social ideal. The character was to some extent based on Father Ambrose of the Optina Monastery, who Dostoevsky had met on a visit to the monastery in 1878. For Zosima&#x27;s teachings in Book VI, &quot;The Russian Monk&quot;, Dostoevsky wrote that the prototype is taken from certain teachings of Tikhon of Zadonsk and &quot;the naïveté of style from the monk Parfeny&#x27;s book of wanderings&quot;. The style and tone in Book VI, where Zosima narrates, is markedly different from the rest of the novel. V. L. Komarovich suggests that the rhythm of the prose is &quot;a departure from all the norms of modern syntax, and at the same time imparts to the entire narration a special, emotional colouring of ceremonial and ideal tranquility.&quot;

=== Ilyusha ===
Ilyusha (sometimes called Ilyushechka) is a local schoolboy, and the central figure of a crucial subplot in the novel. Dmitri assaults and humiliates his father, the impoverished officer Captain Snegiryov, who has been hired by Fyodor Pavlovich to threaten Dmitri over his debts, and the Snegiryov family is brought to shame as a result.

==Synopsis==

=== Book One: &quot;A Nice Little Family&quot; ===
The opening of the novel introduces the Karamazov family and relates the story of their distant and recent past. The details of Fyodor Pavlovich&#x27;s two marriages, as well as his indifference to the upbringing of his three children, is chronicled. The narrator also establishes the widely varying personalities of the three brothers and the circumstances that have led to their return to their father&#x27;s town. The first book concludes by describing the mysterious Eastern Orthodox tradition of the Elders. Alyosha has become devoted to the Elder at the local monastery.

=== Book Two: &quot;An Inappropriate Gathering&quot; ===
Book Two begins as the Karamazov family arrives at the monastery so that the Elder Zosima can act as a mediator between Dmitri and his father in their dispute over the inheritance. It was the father&#x27;s idea, apparently as a joke, to have the meeting take place in such a holy place in the presence of the famous Elder. Fyodor Pavlovich&#x27;s deliberately insulting and provocative behaviour destroys any chance of conciliation, and the meeting only results in intensified hatred and a scandal. This book also contains a scene in which the Elder Zosima consoles a woman mourning the death of her three-year-old son. The poor woman&#x27;s grief parallels Dostoevsky&#x27;s own tragedy at the loss of his young son Alyosha.

=== Book Three: &quot;Sensualists&quot; ===
The third book provides more details of the love triangle among Fyodor Pavlovich, his son Dmitri, and Grushenka. Dmitri hides near his father&#x27;s home to see if Grushenka will arrive. His personality is explored in a long conversation with Alyosha. Later that evening, Dmitri bursts into his father&#x27;s house and assaults him. As he leaves, he threatens to come back and kill him. This book also introduces Smerdyakov and his origins, as well as the story of his mother, Lizaveta Smerdyashchaya. At the conclusion of this book, Alyosha is witness to Grushenka&#x27;s humiliation of Dmitri&#x27;s betrothed Katerina Ivanovna.

=== Book Four: &quot;Lacerations/Strains&quot; ===
This section introduces a side story which resurfaces in more detail later in the novel. It begins with Alyosha observing a group of schoolboys throwing rocks at one of their sickly peers named Ilyusha. When Alyosha admonishes the boys and tries to help, Ilyusha bites Alyosha&#x27;s finger. It is later learned that Ilyusha&#x27;s father, a former staff-captain named Snegiryov, was assaulted by Dmitri, who dragged him by the beard out of a bar. Alyosha soon learns of the further hardships present in the Snegiryov household and offers the former staff captain money as an apology for his brother and to help Snegiryov&#x27;s ailing wife and children. After initially accepting the money with joy, Snegiryov throws it to the ground and stomps it into the sand, before running back into his home.

=== Book Five: &quot;Pro and Contra&quot; ===
Here, the rationalist and nihilistic ideology that permeated Russia at this time is defended and espoused by Ivan Karamazov while meeting his brother Alyosha at a restaurant. In the chapter titled &quot;Rebellion&quot;, Ivan proclaims that he rejects the world that God has created because it is built on a foundation of suffering. In perhaps the most famous chapter in the novel, &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot;, Ivan narrates to Alyosha his imagined poem that describes an encounter between a leader from the Spanish Inquisition and Jesus, who has made his return to Earth. The opposition between reason and faith is dramatised and symbolised in a forceful monologue of the Grand Inquisitor who, having ordered the arrest of Jesus, visits him in prison at night.

Why hast Thou come now to hinder us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou knowest that...We are working not with Thee but with him [Satan]...We took from him what Thou didst reject with scorn, that last gift he offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of the earth. We took from him Rome and the sword of Caesar, and proclaimed ourselves sole rulers of the earth...We shall triumph and shall be Caesars, and then we shall plan the universal happiness of man.

The Grand Inquisitor accuses Jesus of having inflicted on humankind the &quot;burden&quot; of free will. At the end of the Grand Inquisitor&#x27;s lengthy arguments, Jesus silently steps forward and kisses the old man on the lips. The Inquisitor, stunned and moved, tells him he must never come there again, and lets him out. Alyosha, after hearing the story, goes to Ivan and kisses him softly on the lips. Ivan shouts with delight. The brothers part with mutual affection and respect.

=== Book Six: &quot;The Russian Monk&quot; ===
The sixth book relates the life and history of the Elder Zosima as he lies near death in his cell. Zosima explains that he found his faith in his rebellious youth, after an unforgivable action toward his trusted servant, consequently deciding to become a monk. Zosima preaches people must forgive others by acknowledging their own sins and guilt before others. He explains that no sin is isolated, making everyone responsible for their neighbor&#x27;s sins. Zosima represents a philosophy that responds to Ivan&#x27;s, which had challenged God&#x27;s creation in the previous book.

=== Book Seven: &quot;Alyosha&quot; ===
The book begins immediately following the death of Zosima. It is a commonly held perception in the town and the monastery that true holy men&#x27;s bodies are incorrupt, i.e., they do not succumb to putrefaction. Thus, the expectation concerning the Elder Zosima is that his deceased body will not decompose. It therefore comes as a great shock that Zosima&#x27;s body not only decays, but begins the process almost immediately following his death. Within the first day, the smell is already unbearable. For many this calls into question their previous respect and admiration for Zosima. Alyosha is particularly devastated by the sullying of Zosima&#x27;s name due to nothing more than the corruption of his dead body. One of Alyosha&#x27;s companions in the monastery—Rakitin—uses Alyosha&#x27;s vulnerability to set up a meeting between him and Grushenka. However, instead of Alyosha becoming corrupted, he acquires new faith and hope from Grushenka, while Grushenka&#x27;s troubled mind begins the path of spiritual redemption through his influence: they become close friends. The book ends with the spiritual regeneration of Alyosha as he embraces and kisses the earth outside the monastery (echoing, perhaps, Zosima&#x27;s last earthly act before his death) and cries convulsively. Renewed, he goes back out into the world, as his Elder instructed.

=== Book Eight: &quot;Mitya&quot; ===
This section deals primarily with Dmitri&#x27;s wild and distraught pursuit of money for the purpose of running away with Grushenka. Dmitri owes money to his fiancée Katerina Ivanovna, and will believe himself to be a thief if he does not find the money to pay her back before embarking on his quest for Grushenka. Dmitri approaches Grushenka&#x27;s benefactor, Samsonov, who sends him to a neighboring town on a fabricated promise of a business deal. All the while Dmitri is petrified that Grushenka may go to his father and marry him because of his wealth and lavish promises. When Dmitri returns from his failed dealing in the neighboring town, he escorts Grushenka to her benefactor&#x27;s home, but later discovers that she has deceived him and left early. Furious, he runs to his father&#x27;s home with a brass pestle in his hand, and spies on him from the window. He takes the pestle from his pocket. There is a discontinuity in the action, and Dmitri is suddenly running from his father&#x27;s property. The servant Gregory tries to stop him, yelling &quot;Parricide!&quot;, but Dmitri hits him in the head with the pestle. Dmitri, afraid that the blow might have killed Grigori, tries to attend to the wound with his handkerchief, but gives up and runs away.

Dmitri is next seen in a daze on the street, covered in blood, with a pile of money in his hand. He soon learns that Grushenka&#x27;s former betrothed has returned and taken her to a nearby lodge. Upon learning this, Dmitri loads a cart with food and wine and pays for a huge orgy to finally confront Grushenka in the presence of her old flame, intending all the while to kill himself at dawn. The &quot;first and rightful lover&quot; is a boorish Pole who cheats the party at a game of cards. When his deception is revealed, he flees, and Grushenka soon reveals to Dmitri that she really is in love with him. The party rages on, and just as Dmitri and Grushenka are making plans to marry, the police enter the lodge and inform Dmitri that he is under arrest for the murder of his father.

=== Book Nine: &quot;The Preliminary Investigation&quot; ===
Book Nine introduces the details of Fyodor Pavlovich&#x27;s murder and describes the interrogation of Dmitri, who vigorously maintains his innocence. The alleged motive for the crime is robbery. Dmitri was known to have been completely destitute earlier that evening, but is suddenly seen with thousands of rubles shortly after his father&#x27;s murder. Meanwhile, the three thousand rubles that Fyodor Pavlovich had set aside for Grushenka have disappeared. Dmitri explains that the money he spent that evening came from three thousand rubles that Katerina Ivanovna gave him to send to her sister. He spent half that at his first meeting with Grushenka—another drunken orgy—and sewed up the rest in a cloth, intending to give it back to Katerina Ivanovna. The investigators are not convinced by this. All of the evidence points toward Dmitri; the only other person in the house at the time of the murder, apart from Gregory and his wife, was Smerdyakov, who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure he suffered the day before. As a result of the overwhelming evidence against him, Dmitri is formally charged with the murder and taken away to prison to await trial.

=== Book Ten: &quot;Boys&quot; ===
&quot;Boys&quot; continues the story of the schoolboys and Ilyusha last referred to in Book Four. The book begins with the introduction of the young boy Kolya Krasotkin. Kolya is a brilliant boy who proclaims his atheism, socialism, and beliefs in the ideas of Europe. Dostoevsky uses Kolya&#x27;s beliefs, especially in a conversation with Alyosha, to satirize his Westernizer critics by putting their words and beliefs in the mouth of a young boy who doesn&#x27;t really understand what he is talking about. Kolya is bored with life and constantly torments his mother by putting himself in danger. As part of a prank Kolya lies between railroad tracks as a train passes over and becomes something of a legend for the feat. All the other boys look up to Kolya, especially Ilyusha. Since the narrative left Ilyusha in Book Four, his illness has progressively worsened and the doctor states that he will not recover. Kolya and Ilyusha had a falling out over Ilyusha&#x27;s maltreatment of a local dog: Ilyusha had fed it a piece of bread in which he had placed a pin, at the bidding of Smerdyakov. But thanks to Alyosha&#x27;s intervention the other schoolboys have gradually reconciled with Ilyusha, and Kolya soon joins them at his bedside. It is here that Kolya first meets Alyosha and begins to reassess his nihilist beliefs.

=== Book Eleven: &quot;Brother Ivan Fyodorovich&quot; ===
Book Eleven chronicles Ivan Fyodorovich&#x27;s influence on those around him and his descent into madness. It is in this book that Ivan meets three times with Smerdyakov, desperately seeking to solve the riddle of the murder and whether Smerdyakov, and consequently he himself, had anything to do with it. In the final meeting Smerdyakov confesses that he had faked the fit, murdered Fyodor Pavlovich, and stolen the money, which he presents to Ivan. Smerdyakov expresses disbelief at Ivan&#x27;s professed ignorance and surprise. Smerdyakov claims that Ivan was complicit in the murder by telling Smerdyakov when he would be leaving Fyodor Pavlovich&#x27;s house, and more importantly by instilling in Smerdyakov the belief that, in a world without God, &quot;everything is permitted.&quot; The book ends with Ivan having a hallucination in which he is visited by the devil, in the form of an idle and parasitic former gentleman, who torments him by personifying and caricaturing his thoughts and ideas. The nightmare is interrupted by a knocking at the window: it is Alyosha, who has come to inform him that Smerdyakov has hanged himself. Although the devil disappears, Ivan remains in a delirium and converses irrationally. Alyosha is shocked at his brother&#x27;s condition and tries to pacify him, but Ivan&#x27;s ravings become increasingly incoherent. Eventually he falls into a deep sleep.

=== Book Twelve: &quot;A Judicial Error&quot; ===
This book details the trial of Dmitri Karamazov for the murder of his father. The courtroom drama is sharply satirized by Dostoevsky. The men in the crowd are presented as resentful and spiteful, and the women as irrationally drawn to the romanticism of Dmitri&#x27;s love triangle with Katerina and Grushenka. Ivan&#x27;s madness takes its final hold over him and he is carried away from the courtroom after his attempt to give evidence about Smerdyakov descends into incomprehensible raving. The turning point in the trial is Katerina&#x27;s damning testimony. Shocked by Ivan&#x27;s madness, she passionately defends him and abandons her &#x27;honourable&#x27; approach to Dmitri. She produces a letter drunkenly written by Dmitri saying that he would kill his father. The section concludes with lengthy and impassioned closing remarks from the prosecutor and the defence counsel and the verdict that Dmitri is guilty.

=== Epilogue ===
The final section opens with discussion of a plan developed for Dmitri&#x27;s escape from his sentence of twenty years of hard labor in Siberia. The plan is never fully described, but it seems to involve Ivan and Katerina bribing some guards. Alyosha cautiously approves, because he feels that Dmitri is not emotionally ready to submit to such a harsh sentence, that he is innocent, and that no guards or officers would suffer for aiding the escape. Dmitri and Grushenka plan to escape to America and work the land there for several years, and then return to Russia under assumed American names, because they cannot imagine living without Russia. Dmitri begs for Katerina to visit him in the hospital, where he is recovering from an illness, before he is due to be taken away. When she does, Dmitri apologizes for having hurt her; she in turn apologizes for bringing up the implicating letter during the trial. They agree to love each other for that one moment, and say they will love each other forever, even though both now love other people. The novel concludes at Ilyusha&#x27;s funeral, where Ilyusha&#x27;s schoolboy friends listen to Alyosha&#x27;s &quot;Speech by the Stone&quot;. Alyosha promises to remember Kolya, Ilyusha, and all the boys and keep them close in his heart, even though he will have to leave them and may not see them again until many years have passed. He implores them to love each other and to always remember Ilyusha, and to keep his memory alive in their hearts, and to remember this moment at the stone when they were all together and they all loved each other. Alyosha then recounts the Christian promise that they will all be united one day after the Resurrection. In tears, the twelve boys promise Alyosha that they will keep each other in their memories forever. They join hands, and return to the Snegiryov household for the funeral dinner, chanting &quot;Hurrah for Karamazov!&quot;

==Themes==
===Faith and atheism===
One of the novel&#x27;s central themes is the counterposition of the true spiritual meaning of the Orthodox Christian faith, particularly insofar as it is posited as the heart of Russian national identity and history, with the ideas and values emanating from the new doctrines of atheism, rationalism, socialism and nihilism. Not only were these ideas and values alien to Russia&#x27;s spiritual heritage, they were, in Dostoevsky&#x27;s opinion, actively working to destroy it, and moreover were becoming increasingly popular and influential, especially among Russia&#x27;s youth. The theme had already been vividly depicted in all the earlier major novels, particularly &quot;Demons&quot;, but in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; Dostoevsky artistically represents and counterposes the two antithetical worldviews in archetypal forms — the character of Ivan Fyodorovich and his legend of The Grand Inquisitor, and the characters of Alyosha and the Elder Zosima in their expression and embodiment of a &quot;lived&quot; Christian faith.

The character of Ivan Fyodorovich, though he outwardly plays the role of devil&#x27;s advocate, is inwardly far from being resolved in his atheism. A constantly reappearing motif in the novel is his proposition that without faith in immortality, there is no such thing as virtue, and that if there is no God, &quot;everything&quot; is permitted. When Zosima encounters the idea in the meeting at the monastery, he doesn&#x27;t dispute it, but suggests to Ivan that since in all probability he doesn&#x27;t believe in the immortality of his own soul, his thoughts must be a source of torment to him: &quot;But the martyr likes sometimes to divert himself with his despair, as it were driven to it by despair itself. Meanwhile ... you divert yourself with magazine articles, and discussions in society, though you don&#x27;t believe your own arguments, and with an aching heart mock at them inwardly... That question you have not answered, and it is your great grief, for it clamors for an answer.&quot; In his relations with Ivan, Alyosha consciously personifies the loving voice of faith that he knows lives in his brother&#x27;s soul, in opposition to the mocking voice of doubt that ultimately becomes personified in the nightmare of the Devil. Alyosha says of Ivan &quot;His mind is a prisoner of his soul. There is a great and unresolved thought in him. He is one of those who don&#x27;t need millions, they just need to get a thought straight.&quot;

Dostoevsky wrote to his editor that his intention with book V, &quot;Pro and Contra&quot;, was to portray &quot;the seed of the idea of destruction in our time in Russia among the young people uprooted from reality&quot;. This seed is depicted as: &quot;the rejection not of God but of the meaning of His creation. Socialism has sprung from the denial of the meaning of historical reality and ended in a program of destruction and anarchism.&quot; In the chapter &quot;Rebellion&quot;, the rationale behind Ivan&#x27;s rejection of God&#x27;s world is expounded in a long dialogue with Alyosha, in which he justifies his atheism on the grounds of the very principle—universal love and compassion—that is at the heart of the Christian faith. The unmitigated evil in the world, particularly as it relates to the suffering of children, is not something that &quot;can&quot; be accepted by a heart steeped in love, so Ivan feels bound in his conscience to &quot;humbly return the ticket&quot; to God. The idea of the refusal of love on the grounds of love is taken further in the subsequent &quot;Legend of the Grand Inquisitor&quot;. In a long dialogue, in which the second participant (the returned Christ) remains silent for its entire duration, the Inquisitor rejects the freedom and spiritual beauty of Christ&#x27;s teaching as being beyond the capability of earthly humanity, and affirms instead the bread-and-chains materialism derived from the Devil&#x27;s Temptations as being the only realistic and truly compassionate basis for the government of men. The Legend is Ivan&#x27;s confession of the struggle of &quot;pro and contra&quot; taking place within his own soul in relation to the problem of faith. According to Mikhail Bakhtin, &quot;both the very form of its construction as The Grand Inquisitor&#x27;s dialogue with Christ and at the same time with himself, and the very unexpectedness and duality of its finale, indicate an internally dialogic disintegration at its ideological core.&quot;

With Book VI, &quot;The Russian Monk&quot;, Dostoevsky sought to provide the refutation of Ivan&#x27;s negation of God, through the teachings of the dying Elder, Zosima. The dark world of the Inquisitor&#x27;s reasoning is juxtaposed with the radiant, idyllically stylized communications of the dying Elder and Alyosha&#x27;s renderings of his life and teachings. Zosima, though suffering and near death, unreservedly communicates his love for those around him, and recounts the stories of the crucial moments in his progress along the spiritual path. Alyosha records these accounts for posterity, as well as the Elder&#x27;s teachings and discourses on various subjects, including: the significance of the Russian Monk; spiritual brotherhood between masters and servants; the impossibility of judging one&#x27;s fellow creatures; Faith, Prayer, Love, and Contiguity with Other Worlds; and the spiritual meaning of &#x27;hell&#x27; as the suffering of being unable to Love. Dostoevsky based Zosima&#x27;s teachings on those of the 18th century Orthodox saint and spiritual writer Tikhon of Zadonsk, and constructed them around his own formulation of the essence of a true Christian faith: that all are responsible for all, and that &quot;everyone is guilty before all and for everything, and &quot;therefore&quot; everyone is strong enough also to forgive everything for others&quot;. He was acutely aware of the difficulty of the artistic task he had set himself and of the incompatibility of the form and content of his &quot;reply&quot; with ordinary discourse and the everyday concerns of his contemporaries.

===Freedom and mechanistic psychology===
&quot;Dostoevsky could hear dialogic relationships everywhere, in all manifestations of conscious and intelligent human life. Where consciousness began, there dialogue began also. Only purely mechanistic relationships are not dialogic, and Dostoevsky categorically denied their importance for understanding and interpreting life and the acts of man.&quot;

Throughout the novel, in the very nature of all the characters and their interactions, the freedom of the human personality is affirmed, in opposition to any form of deterministic reduction. The &quot;physiologism&quot; that is being attacked is identified in the repeated references to Claude Bernard, who becomes for Dmitri a despised symbol of the scientific reduction of the human soul to impersonal physiological processes. For Dmitri the word &#x27;Bernard&#x27; becomes the most contemptuous of insults. References to Bernard are in part a response to Zola&#x27;s theories about heredity and environment, gleaned from Bernard&#x27;s ideas, which functioned as the ideological background to the &quot;Les Rougon-Macquart&quot; series of novels.

Though the affirmation of freedom and rejection of mechanistic psychology is most openly and forcefully expressed through the character of Dmitri, as a theme it pervades the entire novel and virtually all of Dostoevsky&#x27;s other writings. Bakhtin discusses it in terms of what he calls the &quot;unfinalizability&quot; of Dostoevsky&#x27;s characters. In Dostoevsky, a fundamental refusal to be wholly defined by an external source (another person, a social interpretation, an ideology, a system of &#x27;knowledge&#x27;, or anything at all that places a finalizing limit on the primordial freedom of the living soul, including even death) is at the heart of the character. He sees this quality as essential to the human being, to &quot;being human&quot;, and in his most fiercely independent characters, such as Ivan and Dmitri in &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, Raskolnikov in &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, Nastasya Filippovna and Ippolit in &quot;The Idiot&quot;, or the Underground man in &quot;Notes From Underground&quot;, it is actively expressed in virtually all their words and deeds. According to Bakhtin, for Dostoevsky:A man never coincides with himself. One cannot apply the formula of identity A≡A. In Dostoevsky&#x27;s artistic thinking the genuine life of the personality takes place at the point of non-coincidence between a man and himself, at his point of departure beyond the limits of all that he is as a material being – a being that can be spied on, defined, predicted apart from its own will, &quot;at second hand&quot;. The genuine life of the personality is made available only through a &quot;dialogic&quot; penetration of that personality, during which it freely and reciprocally reveals itself.

==Style==
Although written in the 19th century, &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; displays a number of modern elements. Dostoevsky composed the book with a variety of literary techniques. Though privy to many of the thoughts and feelings of the protagonists, the narrator is a self-proclaimed writer; he discusses his own mannerisms and personal perceptions so often in the novel that he becomes a character. Through his descriptions, the narrator&#x27;s voice merges imperceptibly into the tone of the people he is describing, often extending into the characters&#x27; most personal thoughts. There is no voice of authority in the story. In addition to the principal narrator, there are several sections narrated by other characters entirely, such as the story of The Grand Inquisitor and Zosima&#x27;s confessions.

Dostoevsky uses individual styles of speech to express the inner personality of each person. For example, the attorney Fetyukovich (based on Vladimir Spasovich) is characterized by malapropisms (e.g. &#x27;robbed&#x27; for &#x27;stolen&#x27;, and at one point declares possible suspects in the murder &#x27;irresponsible&#x27; rather than innocent). Several plot digressions provide insight into other apparently minor characters. For example, the narrative in Book Six is almost entirely devoted to Zosima&#x27;s biography, which contains a confession from a man whom he met many years before. Dostoevsky does not rely on a single source or a group of major characters to convey the themes of this book, but uses a variety of viewpoints, narratives and characters throughout.

==Reception and influence==
&quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; has had a deep influence on many public figures over the years for widely varying reasons. Admirers include scientists such as Albert Einstein, philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, as well as writers such as Virginia Woolf, Cormac McCarthy, Haruki Murakami, and Frederick Buechner.

British writer C. P. Snow writes of Einstein&#x27;s admiration for the novel: &quot;&quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;—that for him in 1919 was the supreme summit of all literature. It remained so when I talked to him in 1937, and probably until the end of his life.&quot;

Sigmund Freud called it &quot;the most magnificent novel ever written&quot; and was fascinated with what he saw as its Oedipal themes. In 1928 Freud published a paper titled &quot;Dostoevsky and Parricide&quot; in which he investigated Dostoevsky&#x27;s own neuroses. Freud claimed that Dostoevsky&#x27;s epilepsy was not a natural condition but instead a physical manifestation of the author&#x27;s hidden guilt over his own father&#x27;s death. According to Freud, Dostoevsky (and all other sons) wished for the death of his father because of latent desire for his mother; citing the fact that Dostoevsky&#x27;s epileptic fits began at age 18, the year his father died. It followed that more obvious themes of patricide and guilt, especially in the form of the moral guilt illustrated by Ivan Karamazov, were further literary evidence of his theory.

Franz Kafka felt indebted to Dostoevsky and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, calling himself and Dostoevsky &quot;blood relatives&quot; and was immensely interested in the hatred the brothers demonstrated toward their father in the novel. He probably found parallels with his own strained father-son relationship and drew on this theme to some extent in his works, especially the short story &quot;The Judgment&quot;).

James Joyce wrote:

[Leo] Tolstoy admired him but he thought that he had little artistic accomplishment or mind. Yet, as he said, &#x27;he admired his heart&#x27;, a criticism which contains a great deal of truth, for though his characters do act extravagantly, madly, almost, still their basis is firm enough underneath... &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; ... made a deep impression on me ... he created some unforgettable scenes [detail]... Madness you may call it, but therein may be the secret of his genius... I prefer the word exaltation, exaltation which can merge into madness, perhaps. In fact all great men have had that vein in them; it was the source of their greatness; the reasonable man achieves nothing.

Not all reception to the book was positive. Some were critical of it, such as Henry James, Vladimir Nabokov, D. H. Lawrence, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky, for instance, once said of the novel in a letter that &quot;Dostoyevsky is a writer of genius, but an antipathetic one.&quot;

As for Leo Tolstoy himself, the work appears to have proved both challenging and provocative. Entries from his journal indicate that, like others, he considered Dostoevsky&#x27;s idiosyncratic style to be an obstacle, yet the book was one of several that he requested accompany him on his deathbed.

The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein is said to have read &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; &quot;so often he knew whole passages of it by heart&quot;. A copy of the novel was one of the few possessions Wittgenstein brought with him to the front during World War I.

Martin Heidegger identified Dostoevsky&#x27;s thought as one of the most important sources for his early and best known book, &quot;Being and Time&quot;. Of the two portraits Heidegger kept on the wall of his office, one was of Dostoevsky.

According to philosopher Charles B. Guignon, the novel&#x27;s most fascinating character, Ivan Karamazov, had by the middle of the twentieth century become the icon of existentialist rebellion in the writings of existentialist philosophers Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre. Camus centered on a discussion of Ivan Karamazov&#x27;s revolt in his 1951 book &quot;Rebel&quot;. Ivan&#x27;s poem &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot; is arguably one of the best-known passages in modern literature due to its ideas about human nature, freedom, power, authority, and religion, as well as for its fundamental ambiguity. A reference to the poem can be found in English novelist Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot; and American writer David Foster Wallace&#x27;s novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;.

Nobel Prize laureate William Faulkner reread the book regularly, claiming it as his greatest literary inspiration next to Shakespeare&#x27;s works and the Bible. He once wrote that American literature had yet to produce anything great enough to compare with Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel.

In an essay on &quot;The Brothers Karamazov,&quot; written after the Russian Revolution and the First World War, Nobel Prize-winning author Hermann Hesse described Dostoevsky as not a &quot;poet&quot; but a &quot;prophet&quot;. British writer W. Somerset Maugham included the book in his list of ten greatest novels in the world.

Contemporary Turkish Nobel Prize-winning writer Orhan Pamuk said during a lecture in St. Petersburg that the first time he read &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, his life was changed. He felt Dostoyevsky, through his storytelling, revealed completely unique insight into life and human nature.

American philosophical novelist Walker Percy said in an interview:I suppose my model is nearly always Dostoevsky, who was a man of very strong convictions, but his characters illustrated and incarnated the most powerful themes and issues and trends of his day. I think maybe the greatest novel of all time is &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; which...almost prophesies and prefigures everything—all the bloody mess and the issues of the 20th century.Pope Benedict XVI cited the book in the 2007 encyclical &quot;Spe Salvi&quot;.

Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had read Dostoevsky since his youth and considered the author as a great psychologist. His copy of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; reveals extensive highlights and notes in the margins that he made while reading the work, which have been studied and analyzed by multiple researchers.

According to Serbian state news agency Tanjug, Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić described Dostoevsky as his best-loved novelist, saying: &quot;&quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; may be the best work of world literature.&quot; American First Lady Laura Bush has said she is an admirer of the novel.

==Translations==
Although &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; has been translated from the original Russian into a number of languages, the novel&#x27;s diverse array of distinct voices and literary techniques makes its translation difficult. Constance Garnett published a translation in 1912, which Garth Terry called &quot;the first adequate English translation&quot;. An earlier version (by Isabel Florence Hapgood) was published in 1905.

In 1958, David Magarshack and Manuel Komroff released translations of the novel, published respectively by Penguin and The New American Library of World Literature. In 1976, Ralph Matlaw thoroughly revised Garnett&#x27;s work for his Norton Critical Edition volume. This in turn was the basis for Victor Terras&#x27; influential &quot;A Karamazov Companion&quot;. Another translation is by Julius Katzer, published by Progress Publishers in 1981 and later re-printed by Raduga Publishers Moscow.

In 1990 Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky released a new translation; it won a PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize in 1991 and garnered positive reviews from &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; and the Dostoevsky scholar Joseph Frank, who praised it for being the most faithful to Dostoevsky&#x27;s original Russian.

=== Peter France ===
In &quot;The Oxford Guide to Literature in English Translations&quot;, academic Peter France comments on several translations of Dostoevsky&#x27;s work. In regard to Constance Garnett&#x27;s translations, he writes:

[Her] translations read easily...the basic meaning of the Russian text is accurately rendered on the whole. It is true, as critics such as Nikoliukin have demonstrated, that she shortens and simplifies, muting Dostoevsky&#x27;s jarring contrasts, sacrificing his insistent rhythms and repetitions, toning down the Russian colouring, explaining and normalizing in all kinds of ways...Garnett shortens some of Dostoevsky&#x27;s idiosyncrasy in order to produce an acceptable English text, but her versions were in many cases pioneering versions; decorous they may be, but they allowed this strange new voice to invade English literature and thus made it possible for later translators to go further in the search for more authentic voice.

On David Magarshack&#x27;s Dostoevsky translations, France says:

[I]t is not certain that Magarshack has worn as well as Garnett. He certainly corrects some of her errors; he also aims for a more up-to-date style which flows more easily in English...Being even more thoroughly englished than Garnett&#x27;s, Magarshack&#x27;s translations lack some of the excitement of the foreign.

On Andrew R. MacAndrew&#x27;s American version, he comments: &quot;He translates fairly freely, altering details, rearranging, shortening and explaining the Russian to produce texts which lack a distinctive voice.&quot;

On David McDuff&#x27;s Penguin translation:

McDuff carries this literalism the furthest of any of the translators. In his &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; the odd, fussy tone of the narrator is well rendered in the preface...At times, indeed, the convoluted style might make the reader unfamiliar with Dostoevsky&#x27;s Russian question the translator&#x27;s command of English. More seriously, this literalism means that the dialogue is sometimes impossibly odd—and as a result rather dead...Such &#x27;foreignizing&#x27; fidelity makes for difficult reading.

On the Pevear and Volokhonsky&#x27;s translation, France writes:

Pevear and Volokhonsky, while they too stress the need to exhume the real, rough-edged Dostoevsky from the normalization practised by earlier translators, generally offer a rather more satisfactory compromise between the literal and the readable. In particular, their rendering of dialogue is often livelier and more colloquial than McDuff&#x27;s...Elsewhere, it has to be said, the desire to replicate the vocabulary or syntax of the Russian results in unnecessary awkwardness and obscurity.

In commenting on Ignat Avsey&#x27;s translation, he writes: &quot;His not entirely unprecedented choice of a more natural-sounding English formulation is symptomatic of his general desire to make his text English...His is an enjoyable version in the domesticating tradition.&quot;

<text>The National Topographic System or NTS is the system used by Natural Resources Canada for providing general purpose topographic maps of the country. NTS maps are available in a variety of scales, the standard being 1:50,000 and 1:250,000 scales. The maps provide details on landforms and terrain, lakes and rivers, forested areas, administrative zones, populated areas, roads and railways, as well as other human-made features. These maps are currently used by all levels of government and industry for forest fire and flood control (as well as other environmental issues), depiction of crop areas, right-of-way, real estate planning, development of natural resources and highway planning. To add context, land area outside Canada is depicted on the 1:250,000 maps, but not on the 1:50,000 maps.

==History==
Topographic mapping in Canada was originally undertaken by many different agencies, with the Canadian Army’s Intelligence Branch forming a survey division to create a more standardized mapping system in 1904. The indexing system used today was established in 1923, and the map catalogue officially became the National Topographic System in 1926.

==Subdivisions==

The subdivision scheme that the National Topographic System uses is known as the &quot;National Tiling System&quot;, which also functions as a coarse method of geocoding. This scheme initially splits the country into three major &quot;zones&quot;, each spanning a different range of latitudes. The &quot;Southern zone&quot; covers latitudes between 40°N and 68°N, the &quot;Arctic zone&quot; covers latitudes between 68°N and 80°N, and the &quot;High Arctic zone&quot; covers latitudes between 80°N and 88°N. The National Tiling System is capable of covering all points with latitudes ranging from 40°N to 80°N and longitudes from 48°W to 144°W, as well as all points with latitudes ranging from 80°N to 88°N and longitudes from 56°W to 136°W.

Each National Tiling System zone is divided into individual 1:1,000,000 scale &quot;map series&quot;, denoted by a number indicating its general position in the country (e.g., 30); which each map series divided into several 1:250,000 scale &quot;map areas&quot;, denoted by a letter (e.g., M); and each map area divided into 1:50,000 scale &quot;map sheets&quot;, denoted by a number (e.g., 13). These numbers and letters are then combined to form a unique designator for a map sheet, in this case, , identifying a map sheet which includes the city of Vaughan, Ontario. Some map sheets are further sub-divided at their central meridian into two 1:50,000 scale &quot;half-sheets&quot;, with an E or W appended onto the map sheet designator.

All map series span four degrees of latitude, but each spans a different range of longitudes depending on the zone it is located in. Map series in the Southern and Arctic zones span eight degrees of longitude, while those in the High Arctic zone span sixteen degrees of longitude. In the Southern and Arctic zones, the National Tiling System numbers map series by latitude and longitude. After padding a map series number to three digits using leading zeroes, the last digit in a map series number indicates a specific range of latitudes, and the number formed by the other digits indicates a specific range of longitudes. In the High Arctic zone, map series numbers are three digits, with the first two digits of each number inherited from the two map series in the Arctic zone immediately to the south.

In the Southern zone, map series are divided into sixteen map areas, each assigned a letter from A through P, while in the Arctic and High Arctic zones, they are split into eight map areas, each assigned a letter from A through H. The letters are assigned in a boustrophedon pattern starting with the southeasternmost map area in a series.

Each map area in turn is split into sixteen map sheets, numbered from 1 through 16 in an identical boustrophedon pattern to the map areas. A map sheet in the Southern zone spans half a degree of longitude, one in the Arctic zone spans a full degree, and one in the High Arctic zone spans two degrees.

Each of these 1:50,000 sheets, in turn, was at one time split into eight 1:25,000 scale map sub-sheets, lettered as lower-case a to h, using the same boustrophedon pattern as the smaller-scale map areas and sheets. These 1:25,000 scale maps were produced from the 1960s to about 1975, then abandoned, and liquidated in the 1980s (along with the scattered coverage of the 1:500,000 and 1:125,000 scale). Most were quadrangles of 7.5&#x27; by 7.5&#x27;, but two unusually-shaped coverages were provided to cover Whitehorse, one being primarily 105 D/11 h but with portions of g and 105 D/10 e; the other had small portions of 105 D/14 a and b. &quot;Military Town Plans&quot; were also prepared on the same 1:25,000 scale, with &quot;declassified versions&quot; available to the public; the classified versions had places of military significance marked; these maps did not follow a quadrangle plan of any kind.

Not all National Topographic System maps strictly follow the National Tiling System&#x27;s linear grid. Some maps also, as an &quot;overedge&quot;, cover land in an area which would otherwise be covered by an adjacent map sheet, simply because the latter area does not contain enough land in Canada to warrant a separate printing.

<text>Friedrich Hermann Otto Finsch (8 August 1839, Warmbrunn – 31 January 1917, Braunschweig) was a German ethnographer, naturalist and colonial explorer. He is known for a two-volume monograph on the parrots of the world which earned him a doctorate. He also wrote on the people of New Guinea and was involved in plans for German colonization in Southeast Asia. Several species of bird (such as &quot;Oenanthe finschii&quot;, &quot;Iole finschii&quot;, &quot;Psittacula finschii&quot;) are named after him as also the town of Finschhafen in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea and a crater on the Moon.

==Biography==

Finsch was born at Bad Warmbrunn in Silesia to Mortiz Finsch and Mathilde née Leder. His father was in the glass trade and he too trained as a glass painter. An interest in birds led him to use his artistic skills for the purpose. Finsch went to Budapest in 1857 and studied at the Royal Hungarian University, earning money by preparing natural history specimens. He then spent two years in Russe, Bulgaria on an invitation from the Austrian Consul and gave private tutoring in German while exploring the birdlife of the region. He published his first paper in the &quot;Journal fur Ornithologie&quot; on the birds of Bulgaria. This experience helped him obtain a curatorial position at the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden (1862–1865) assisting Herman Schlegel. In 1864 he returned to Germany on the suggestion of Gustav Hartlaub to become curator of the museum in Bremen and became its director in 1876. After publishing the two volume monographs on the parrots of the world, &quot;Die Papageien, monographisch bearbeitet&quot; (1867–68), he obtained an honorary doctorate from the Friedrich Wilhelms University in Bonn. Apart from ornithology he also took an interest in ethnology. In 1876 he accompanied the zoologist Alfred Brehm on an expedition to Turkestan and northwest China.
Finsch resigned as curator of the museum in 1878 in order that he could resume his travels, sponsored by the Humboldt Foundation. Between spring 1879 and 1885 he made several visits to the Polynesian Islands, New Zealand, Australia and New Guinea. His proposal was to obtain as many artefacts as possible with the claim that native cultures, fauna and flora were fast vanishing. Finsch was shocked by the punitive actions of the English Methodist missionary George Brown (1835–1917) and was concerned by the violent conflicts between the natives and westerners. He also found no support for contemporary ideas on race with neat categories and found instead a continuum of variations in the human form. After witnessing a cannibal feast at Matupit he commented that the people were still not classifiable as &quot;savages&quot; as they maintained neat agriculture, had their own song, dance and followed commerce. He returned to Germany in 1882 and began to promote the creation of German colonies in the Pacific along with the &quot;South Sea Plotters&quot;, an influential group led by a banker Adolph von Hansemann. In 1884 he returned aboard the steamer &quot;Samoa&quot; to New Guinea as Bismarck&#x27;s Imperial Commissioner to explore potential harbours under the guise of scientists and negotiated for the north-eastern portion of that island, together with New Britain and New Ireland, to become a German protectorate. It was renamed Kaiser-Wilhelmsland and the Bismarck Archipelago. The capital of the colony was named Finschhafen in his honour. In 1885 he was the first European to discover the Sepik river, and he named it after Kaiserin Augusta, the German Empress. Newspapers of the period speculated that he would be appointed as an administrator to the new territories but this never happened. He was instead offered a position as station director which involved menial administrative tasks that would come in the way of his plans to explore and study the region. He returned to Germany and spent much of the subsequent period without formal employment. Finsch had been married to Josephine Wychodil from around 1873 but they divorced around 1880. In 1886 he married Elisabeth née Hoffman (1860–1925). Elisabeth was a talented artist and she illustrated many of his catalogues. Finsch was briefly an advisor to the Neuguinea-Kompagnie. In 1898 he abandoned his dreams in ethnology and returned to ornithology, becoming curator of the bird collections at the Rijksmuseum in Leiden. He did not enjoy this period, noting that life for him, his wife and daughter Esther, felt like living in exile. He also wrote several articles on his past work &quot;Wie ich Kaiser-Wilhelmsland erwarb&quot; (How I acquired Kaiser Wilhelm’s Land, 1902) and &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelmsland. Eine friedliche Kolonialerwerbung&quot; (Kaiser Wilhelm’s Land: A peaceful colonial acquisition, 1905). Seeking return to Germany, he finally joined the ethnographical department of the Municipal Museum in Brunswick in 1904 and worked the remainder of his life there. In 1909 he was titled professor by the Duke of Braunschweig and honoured with a &#x27;medal for distinguished services for art and science&#x27; in silver.

One of his major works was on the parrots of the world. This was not without its critics, since he often tried to rename genera apparently to gain taxonomic authorship.

Several species of birds bear his name, including the lilac-crowned parrot (&quot;Amazona finschi)&quot;, Finsch&#x27;s wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe finschii)&quot;, Finsch&#x27;s bulbul (&quot;Alophoixus finschii)&quot;, and the grey-headed parakeet (&quot;Psittacula finschii)&quot;. A species of monitor lizard, &quot;Varanus finschi&quot;, is named after him, because he collected what would become the holotype for this species. The crater Finsch on the Moon is also named in his honor.

In 2008, following international treaties, some of the human remains that he had collected from Cape York and the Torres Straits that were held in the Charité Medical University in Berlin were repatriated. Additional remains have also been repatriated.

<doc id="607552" wikidata="Q4322107" url="?curid=607552" title="Military history of New Zealand during World War II">
<text>The military history of New Zealand during World War II began when New Zealand entered the Second World War by declaring war on Nazi Germany with the United Kingdom in 1939, and expanded to the Pacific War when New Zealand declared war on Imperial Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. New Zealand&#x27;s forces were soon serving across Europe and beyond, where their reputation was generally very good. In particular, the force of the New Zealanders who were stationed in Northern Africa and Southern Europe was known for its strength and determination, and uniquely so on both sides.

New Zealand provided personnel for service in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and in the Royal Navy and was prepared to have New Zealanders serving under British command. There were many instances of New Zealanders commanding troops on their own, whether their own or a mixture of theirs and foreign ones; notable commanders include Lieutenant-General Bernard Freyberg and Lieutenant-Colonel Fred Baker. Their stationing in North Africa and Greece, specifically during the First and Second Battles of El Alamein and the Freyburg-commanded Crete campaign, was generally well known on either side for its strength, effectiveness and &quot;spiritual&quot; connection. Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) pilots, many trained in the Empire Air Training Scheme, were sent to Europe but, unlike the other Dominions, New Zealand did not insist on its aircrews serving with RNZAF squadrons, so speeding up the rate at which they entered service. The Long Range Desert Group was formed in North Africa in 1940 with New Zealand and Rhodesian as well as British volunteers, but included no Australians for the same reason.

The New Zealand government placed the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy at the Admiralty&#x27;s disposal and made available to the RAF 30 new Wellington medium bombers waiting in the United Kingdom for shipping to New Zealand. The New Zealand Army contributed the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF).

==Background==
Diplomatically, New Zealand had expressed vocal opposition to fascism in Europe and also to the appeasement of fascist dictatorships, and national sentiment for a strong show of force met with general support. Economic and defensive considerations also motivated New Zealand involvement—reliance on Britain meant that threats to Britain became threats to New Zealand too in terms of economic and defensive ties.

There was also a strong sentimental link between the former British colony and the United Kingdom, with many seeing Britain as the &quot;mother country&quot; or &quot;Home&quot;. This was reinforced by New Zealand&#x27;s status as a &quot;white dominion&quot; of the British Empire. The New Zealand Prime Minister of the time Michael Joseph Savage summed this up at the outbreak of war with a broadcast on 5 September (largely written by the Solicitor-General Henry Cornish) that became a popular cry in New Zealand during the war: 

It is with gratitude in the past, and with confidence in the future, that we range ourselves without fear beside Britain, where she goes, we go! Where she stands, we stand!
==Declaration of war on Nazi Germany==
The state of war with Germany was officially held to have existed since 9:30 pm on 3 September 1939 (local time), simultaneous with that of Britain, but in fact New Zealand&#x27;s declaration of war was not made until confirmation had been received from Britain that their ultimatum to Germany had expired. When Neville Chamberlain broadcast Britain&#x27;s declaration of war, a group of New Zealand politicians (led by Peter Fraser because Prime Minister Michael Savage was terminally ill) listened to it on the shortwave radio in Carl Berendsen&#x27;s room in the Parliament Buildings. Because of static on the radio, they were not certain what Chamberlain had said until a coded telegraph message was received later from London. This message did not arrive until just before midnight because the messenger boy with the telegram in London took shelter due to a (false) air raid warning. The Cabinet acted after hearing the Admiralty&#x27;s notification to the fleet that war had broken out. The next day the Cabinet approved nearly 30 war regulations as laid down in the War Book, and after completing the formalities with the Executive Council the Governor-General, Lord Galway, issued the Proclamation of War, backdated to 9.30 pm on 3 September.

== Home front ==

In total, around 140,000 New Zealand personnel served overseas for the Allied war effort, and an additional 100,000 men were armed for Home Guard duty. At its peak in July 1942, New Zealand had 154,549 men and women under arms (excluding the Home Guard) and by the war&#x27;s end, a total of 194,000 men and 10,000 women had served in the armed forces at home and overseas.

Auxiliary services were raised for women: the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Army Corps was the largest, followed by the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force, and then the Women&#x27;s Royal New Zealand Naval Service.

Conscription was introduced in June 1940, and volunteering for Army service ceased from 22 July 1940, although entry to the Air Force and Navy remained voluntary. Difficulties in filling the Second and Third Echelons for overseas service in 1939–1940, the Allied disasters of May 1940 and public demand led to its introduction. Four members of the cabinet including Prime Minister Peter Fraser had been imprisoned for anti-conscription activities in World War I, the Labour Party was traditionally opposed to it, and some members still demanded &quot;conscription of wealth before men&quot;. From January 1942, workers could be &quot;manpowered&quot; or directed to essential industries.

Access to imports was hampered and rationing made doing some things very difficult. Fuel and rubber shortages were overcome with novel approaches. In New Zealand, industry switched from civilian needs to making war materials. New Zealand and Australia supplied the bulk of foodstuffs to American forces in the South Pacific, as Reverse Lend-Lease. With earlier commitments to supply food to Britain this led to both Britain and America (MacArthur) complaining about food going to the other ally (and Britain commenting on the much more generous ration allocations for American soldiers; General George Marshall admitted that the meat ration was too large, but he was not going to challenge the ration set by Congress). By 1943 there was a manpower crisis, and eventually the withdrawal of the Third Division from the Pacific. To alleviate manpower shortages in the agricultural sector, the New Zealand Women&#x27;s Land Army was created in 1940; a total of 2,711 women served on farms throughout New Zealand during the war.

===Axis naval activity in New Zealand waters===

German and Japanese surface raiders and submarines operated in New Zealand waters on several occasions in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1945, sinking a total of four ships while Japanese reconnaissance aircraft flew over Auckland and Wellington preparing for a projected Japanese invasion of New Zealand.

During the winter of 1944, the government hastened work on docks and repair facilities at Auckland and Wellington following a British request, to supplement the bases and repair yards in Australia needed for the British Pacific Fleet.

== Land forces ==
=== Greek campaign ===

The New Zealand authorities deployed the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force for combat in three echelons – all originally destined for Egypt, but one diverted to Scotland (it would arrive there in June 1940) following the German invasion of France. In April 1941, after a period training in Egypt, 2NZEF&#x27;s New Zealand 2nd Division, stationed in Egypt, deployed to take part in the defence of Greece against invasion by Italian troops, and soon German forces too when they joined the invasion. This defence was mounted alongside British and Australian units – the corps-size Commonwealth contingent under the command of British General Henry Maitland Wilson known together as W Force, supported a weakened Greek Army.

As German panzers began a swift advance into Greece on 6 April, the British and Commonwealth troops found themselves being outflanked and were forced into retreat. By 9 April, Greece had been forced to surrender and the 40,000 W Force troops began a withdrawal from the country to Crete and Egypt, the last New Zealand troops leaving by 29 April.

During this brief campaign, the New Zealanders lost 261 men killed, 1,856 captured and 387 wounded.

===Crete===
Two of the three brigades of the New Zealand 2nd Division had evacuated to Crete from Greece (the third and division headquarters went to Alexandria). New Zealanders bolstered the Crete garrison to a total of 34,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers (25,000 evacuated from Greece) alongside 9,000 Greek troops (see Crete order of battle for more detail). Evacuated to Crete on 28 April (having disregarded an order to leave on 23 April), the New Zealand General Freyberg became commander of the Allied forces on Crete on the 30th. Ultra intercepts of German signals had already alerted Allied commanders to the German plans to invade Crete with &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (Luftwaffe paratroopers). With this knowledge, General Freyberg began to prepare the island&#x27;s defences, hampered by a lack of modern and heavy equipment, as the troops from Greece had in most cases had to leave only with their personal weapons. Although German plans had underestimated Greek, British and Commonwealth numbers, and incorrectly presumed that the Cretan population would welcome the invasion, Freyberg was still faced with the harsh prospect that even lightly equipped paratroopers could overwhelm the island&#x27;s defences.

Operation Mercury opened on 20 May when the German Luftwaffe delivered &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; around the airfield at Maleme and the Chania area, at around 8:15 pm, by paradrop and gliders. Most of the New Zealand forces were deployed around this north-western part of the island and with British and Greek troops they inflicted heavy casualties upon the initial German attacks. Despite near complete defeat for their landing troops east of the airfield and in the Galatas region, the Germans were able to gain a foothold by mid-morning west of Maleme Airfield (5 Brigade&#x27;s area) – along the Tavronitis riverbed and in the Ayia Valley to the east (10 Brigade&#x27;s area – dubbed &#x27;Prison Valley&#x27;).

====Maleme====
Over the course of the morning, the 600-strong New Zealand 22 Battalion defending Maleme Airfield found its situation rapidly worsening. The battalion had lost telephone contact with the brigade headquarters; the battalion headquarters (in Pirgos) had lost contact with C and D Companies, stationed on the airstrip and along the Tavronitis-side of Hill 107 (see map) respectively and the battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie Andrew (VC) had no idea of the enemy paratrooper strength to his west, as his observation posts lacked wireless sets. While a platoon of C Company situated northwest of the airfield, nearest the sea, was able to repel German attacks along the beach, attacks across the Tavronitis bridge by &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; were able to overwhelm weaker positions and take the Royal Air Force camp. Not knowing whether C and D Companies had been overrun, and with German mortars firing from the riverbed, Colonel Andrew (with unreliable wireless contact) ordered the firing of white and green signals – the designated emergency signal for 23 Battalion (to the south-east of Pirgos), under the command of Colonel Leckie, to counterattack. The signal was not spotted, and further attempts were made to get the message through to no avail. At 5:00 pm, contact was made with Brigadier James Hargest at the New Zealand 2nd Division headquarters, but Hargest responded that 23 Battalion was fighting paratroopers in its own area, an untrue and unverified assertion.

Faced with a seemingly desperate situation, Colonel Andrew played his trump card – two Matilda tanks, which he ordered to counterattack with the reserve infantry platoon and some additional gunners turned infantrymen. The counterattack failed – one tank had to turn back after suffering technical problems (the turret would not traverse properly) and the second ignored the German positions in the RAF camp and the edge of the airfield, heading straight for the riverbed. This lone tank stranded itself quickly on a boulder and faced with the same technical difficulties as the first Matilda, the crew abandoned the vehicle. The exposed infantry were repelled by the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot;. At around 6:00 pm, the failure was reported to Brigadier Hargest and the prospect of a withdrawal was raised. Colonel Andrew was informed that he could withdraw if he wished, with the famous reply &quot;Well, if you must, you must,&quot; but that two companies (A Company, 23 Battalion and B Company, 28 (Māori) Battalion) were being sent to reinforce 22 Battalion. To Colonel Andrew, the situation seemed bleak; ammunition was running low, the promised reinforcements seemed not to be forthcoming (one got lost, the other simply did not arrive as quickly as expected) and he still had no idea how C and D companies were. The two companies in question were in fact resisting strongly on the airfield and above the Tavronitis riverbed and had inflicted far greater losses on the Germans than they had suffered. At 9:00 pm, Andrew made the decision to make a limited withdrawal, and once that had been carried out, a full one to the 21 and 23 Battalion positions to the east. By midnight, all of 22 Battalion had left the Maleme area, with the exception of C and D Companies which withdrew in the early morning of the 21st upon discovering that the rest of the battalion had gone.

This allowed German troops to seize the airfield proper without opposition and take nearby positions to reinforce their hold on it. Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft flew in ammunition and supplies, as well as the rest of the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; and troops of the 5th Mountain Division. Although the landings were extremely hazardous, with the airstrip under direct British artillery fire, substantial reinforcement was made. On 21 May, the village of Maleme was attacked and captured by the Germans, and a counterattack was made by the 20 Battalion (with reinforcements from the Australian 2/7 Battalion), 28 (Māori) Battalion and later 21 Battalion. The attack was hampered by communications problems and although the New Zealanders made significant advances in some areas, the overall picture was one of stiff German resistance. 5 Brigade fell back to a new line at Platanias, leaving Maleme securely in German hands, allowing them to freely build up their force in this region.

====Galatas====

On the night of 23 May and the morning of 24 May, 5 Brigade withdrew again to the area near Daratsos, forming a new front line running from Galatas to the sea. The relatively fresh 18 Battalion replaced the worn troops from Maleme and Platanias, deploying 400 men on a two kilometre front.

Galatas had come under attack on the first day of the battle — &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; and gliders had landed around Chania and Galatas, to suffer extremely heavy casualties. They retreated to &quot;Prison Valley,&quot; where they rallied around Ayia Prison and repulsed a confused counterattack by two companies of 19 Battalion and three light tanks. Pink Hill (so named for the colour of its soil), a crucial point on the Galatas heights, was attacked several times by the Germans that day and was remarkably held by the Division Petrol Company, with the aid of Greek soldiers, though at a heavy cost to both sides. The Petrol Company comprised poorly armed support troops, primarily drivers and technicians, and by the day&#x27;s end, all their officers and most of their non-commissioned officers had been wounded. They withdrew around dusk. On the second day, the New Zealanders attacked nearby Cemetery Hill to take pressure off their line, and although they had to withdraw, for it was too exposed, the hill became a no man&#x27;s land as Pink Hill was, relieving the New Zealand front. Day three, 22 May, saw German soldiers take Pink Hill. The Petrol Company and some infantry reserve prepared a counterattack, but a notable incident pre-empted them – as told by Driver A. Pope:

Out of the trees came [Captain] Forrester of the Buffs, clad in shorts, a long yellow army jersey reaching down almost to the bottom of the shorts, brass polished and gleaming, web belt in place and waving his revolver in his right hand [...] It was a most inspiring sight. Forrester was at the head of a crowd of disorderly Greeks, including women; one Greek had a shotgun with a serrated-edge bread knife tied on like a bayonet, others had ancient weapons—all sorts. Without hesitation, this uncouth group, with Forrester right out in front, went over the top of a parapet and headlong at the crest of the hill. The [Germans] fled. 
Days four and five featured only skirmishes between the two forces. Luftwaffe air raids targeted Galatas on 25 May at 8:00 am, 12:45 pm and 1:15 pm, and the German ground attack came at around 2:00 pm. 100 Mountain and 3 Parachute Regiment attacked Galatas and the high ground around it, while two battalions of 85 Mountain Regiment attacked eastwards, with the aim of cutting Chania off. The New Zealand defenders, though prepared, suffered from a disadvantage: 18 Battalion, 400 men, was the only fresh infantry formation on the line – the rest were non-infantry groups like the Petrol Company and the Composite Battalion, consisting of mechanical, supply and artillery troops. The fighting was fierce, especially along the north of the line, and platoons and companies were forced to retreat. Brigadier Lindsay Inglis called for reinforcement and received 23 Battalion, which, along with an improvised group of reinforcements scraped together at Brigade headquarters (including the brigade band and the Kiwi Concert Party), stabilised the north of the line. South of Galatas, only 18 Battalion and the Petrol Company were defending – 18 Battalion was forced to withdraw, and the Petrol Company on Pink Hill followed suit after eventually becoming aware of this. 19 Battalion was the only formation still in combat on Pink Hill, and they too withdrew. These forces withdrew past Galatas, as no defenders were in the village to link up with.

By nightfall, German troops had occupied Galatas, and Lieutenant-Colonel Howard Kippenberger prepared a counterattack. Two tanks led two companies of 23 Battalion into Galatas at a running pace – heavy fire was encountered and as the tanks went ahead towards the town square, the infantry cleared each house of German soldiers as they worked inward. When the infantry caught up with the tanks, they found one out of action. With German fire coming primarily from one side of the square, a bayonet charge was mounted and the New Zealanders cleared the German opposition. Patrols quelled resistance elsewhere in Galatas – apart from one small strongpoint, Galatas was back in New Zealand hands.

A conference between Brigadier Inglis and his commanders reached the consensus that Allied forces needed to make a further counterattack urgently – and that without a counterattack Crete would fall to the Germans. Despite hard fighting so far in the battle, the 28 (Māori) Battalion was considered to be the only &quot;fresh&quot; battalion available and the only one capable of carrying out such an attack. Their commander was willing to mount the attack despite the difficulty, but a representative sent from Brigadier Edward Puttick at New Zealand 2nd Division headquarters recommended against such an attack for fear of being unable to hold the line subsequently. The counter-attack was scrapped, and so too was Galatas, its position being far too vulnerable to hold. Without Galatas the whole line was untenable and so the New Zealanders again retreated, forming a line from the coast to Perivolia and Mournies, near the Australian 19th Brigade.

While New Zealand soldiers formed the majority of the personnel of the Long Range Desert Group when it was formed in 1940, and a small number of New Zealand transport and signals units supported Operation Compass in the Western Desert in December 1940, it was not until November 1941 that the 2nd New Zealand Division became fully involved in the North African Campaign. Following its evacuation from Crete, the division regrouped at its camp near Maadi, at the base of the desert slopes of Wadi Digla and Tel al-Maadi. Reinforcements arrived from New Zealand to bring the division back up to strength and the training, cut short by the deployment to Greece and Crete, was completed.

On 18 November 1941, Operation Crusader was launched to lift the Siege of Tobruk (the third such attack), under the command of Lieutenant-General Alan Cunningham and the 2nd New Zealand Division (integrated into the British Eighth Army) took part in the offensive, crossing the Libyan frontier into Cyrenaica. Operation Crusader was an overall success for the British, although Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps inflicted heavy armour and infantry losses before its weakened and under-supplied units retreated to El Agheila and halted the British advance. The New Zealand troops were the ones to relieve Tobruk after fighting around Sidi Rezegh, where Axis tanks had inflicted heavy casualties against the several New Zealand infantry battalions, protected by very little of their own armour. In February 1942, with Crusader completed, the New Zealand government insisted that the division be withdrawn to Syria to recover – 879 men were killed and 1,700 wounded during the operation, the most costly battle the 2nd New Zealand Division fought in the Second World War.

On 14 June 1942, the generals recalled the New Zealanders from their occupation duties in Syria, as the Afrika Korps had broken through Gazala and captured Tobruk. The New Zealanders, put on the defence, found themselves encircled at Minqar Qa&#x27;im, but escaped thanks to brutally efficient hand-to-hand fighting by 4 Brigade. The British forces prevented Rommel&#x27;s advance from reaching Alexandria, Cairo and the Suez Canal in the First Battle of El Alamein, where New Zealand troops captured Ruweisat Ridge in a successful night attack. They were unable to bring their anti-tank weapons forward, and more importantly, British armour did not move forward to support the soldiers. Heavy casualties were suffered by the two New Zealand brigades involved, as they were attacked by German tanks, and several thousand men were taken prisoner. Charles Upham earned a bar for his Victoria Cross in this battle.

With the Eighth Army now under the new command of Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery, the Army launched a new offensive on 23 October against the stalled Axis forces in the Second Battle of El Alamein. On the first night, as part of Operation Lightfoot, the New Zealand 2nd Division, with British divisions, moved through the deep Axis minefields while engineers cleared routes for British tanks to follow. The New Zealanders successfully captured their objectives on Miteiriya Ridge. By 2 November, with the attack bogged down, Montgomery launched a new initiative to the south of the battle lines, Operation Supercharge, with the ultimate goal of destroying the Axis army. The experienced 2nd New Zealand Division was called on to carry out the initial thrust – the same sort of attack they had made in &quot;Lightfoot&quot;. As the under-strength division could not achieve this mission alone, two British brigades were attached. The German line was breached by British armour and, on 4 November, the Afrika Korps, faced with the prospect of complete defeat, skillfully withdrew.

The New Zealanders continued to advance with the Eighth Army through the Tunisia Campaign, driving the Afrika Korps back into Tunisia, and notably fought at Medenine, the Tebaga Gap and Enfidaville. On 13 May 1943, the North African campaign ended with the surrender of the last 275,000 Axis troops in Tunisia. On 15 May, the division began a withdrawal back to Egypt and, by 1 June, the division had returned to Maadi and Helwan, on standby for use in Europe. Total losses for the 2nd New Zealand Division since November 1941 stood at 2,989 killed, 7,000 wounded and 4,041 taken prisoner.

=== Italy ===

During October and November 1943, New Zealand troops from the 2nd New Zealand Division assembled in Bari in Apulia, weeks after the Allied invasion of Italy. In November, the division crossed the Sangro River with a view to breaching the German Gustav Line and advancing to Rome, capturing the village of Castelfrentano in the Abruzzo (part of the Gustav Line) on 2 December. The division attacked Orsogna on the next day but was repulsed by the strong German defence. In January 1944, the 2nd New Zealand was withdrawn from the stalled front line and transferred to the Cassino sector, where other Allied troops were bogged down in costly fighting for the position of Monte Cassino. On 17 February, the division attacked Cassino but it was strongly defended and they withdrew in early April. Cassino was eventually captured on 18 May by British and Polish troops, with the support of New Zealand artillery units. On 16 July, the division captured Arezzo and reached Florence on 4 August. By the end of October, they had reached the Savio River, and Faenza was captured on 14 December. In Operation Grapeshot, the final Allied offensive in Italy, the division crossed the Senio River on 8 April 1945, then began their final push across the Santerno and Gaiana Rivers, finally crossing the Po River on Anzac Day 1945. The division captured Padua on 28 April 1945, crossed the Isonzo River on 1 May, and reached Trieste on 2 May, the day of the German unconditional surrender.

=== Campaigns in the Pacific ===
When Japan entered the war in December 1941, the New Zealand Government raised another expeditionary force, known as the 2nd N.Z.E.F. In the Pacific, or 2nd N.Z.E.F. (I.P.), for service with the Allied Pacific Ocean Areas command. This force supplemented existing garrison troops in the South Pacific. The main fighting formation of the 2nd N.Z.E.F. (I.P.) comprised the New Zealand 3rd Division. The 3rd Division never fought as a complete formation; its component brigades became involved in semi-independent actions as part of the Allied forces in the Solomons at Vella Lavella), Treasury Islands and Green Island. The War Cabinet had held the division at two rather than three brigades, and this limited its use, although MacArthur had a role for a full division; Halsey was &quot;greatly disappointed that New Zealand could not furnish a division with three full brigades&quot; but his deputy accepted that the division was last in New Zealand&#x27;s Pacific priorities, after the air force, navy and food production. Preference was given to the Second Division, on the advice of Churchill and Roosevelt. New Zealand also had 19,000 troops in New Caledonia, Tonga, Norfolk Island and Fiji in 1943; and the 3,000 Air Force personnel would rise to 6,000 when more planes were available. In Australia the reaction of Curtin (but not Evatt) to the withdrawal of the Third Division was hostile.

Eventually, American formations replaced the New Zealand army units in the Pacific, which released personnel for service with the 2nd Division in Italy, or to cover shortages in the civilian labour force. New Zealand Air Force squadrons and Navy units continued to contribute to the Allied island-hopping campaign, with several RNZAF squadrons supporting Australian ground troops on Bougainville.

In 1945 Peter Fraser wanted to contribute to a Commonwealth force against Japan, including an army contribution of at least two brigade groups as &quot;from previous experience small units are given the harder jobs or are not properly supported&quot;. But during the Hamilton by-election, 1945, National had campaigned on withdrawing New Zealand troops from Italy and restricting New Zealand&#x27;s role in the Pacific War to food supply, Labour wanted to keep New Zealand troops in the Pacific to &quot;have a say&quot; in the peace. So Fraser met the Opposition leaders Sidney Holland and Adam Hamilton before the Dunedin North by-election, 1945, noting the divisions in his own caucus. Holland agreed with Fraser not to refer to the matter (which was agitating the whole country) during the by-election campaign, saying it would not be right to divide the House on this. In a (non-broadcast) semi-secret section on 2 August, the House agreed to participate in a force against Japan &quot;within the capacity of our remaining resources of manpower&quot;. National&#x27;s proposal to reduce the total armed forces to 55,000 was accepted.

The Commonwealth Corps, planned to participate in Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan, would have included New Zealand Army and Air Force units, with Air Force units included in Tiger Force to bomb Japan.

In 1945, some troops who had recently returned from Europe with the 2nd Division were drafted to form a contribution (known as J-Force) toward the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in southern Japan. No. 14 Squadron RNZAF, equipped with Corsair fighters, and RNZN ships also joined BCOF.

== Naval actions ==

At the outbreak of war in 1939, New Zealand still contributed to the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy. Many New Zealanders served alongside other Commonwealth sailors in vessels of the Royal Navy and would continue to do so throughout the war.

 took part in the Battle of the River Plate (13 December 1939) as part of a small British force against the German pocket battleship . The action resulted in the German ship retiring to neutral Uruguay and its scuttling a few days later.

Another cruiser, , destroyed the Italian auxiliary cruiser off the Maldives on 27 February 1941. The New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy became the Royal New Zealand Navy when King George VI granted it the name on 1 October 1941.

=== Naval war against Japan ===

On 13 December 1939, New Zealand deployed its naval forces against Germany. The first vessel into action against Japan, the minesweeper , steamed forward to Fiji, arriving on Christmas Day, 1941. HMNZS &quot;Rata&quot; and &quot;Muritai&quot; arrived in January 1942, followed by the corvettes , and , to form a minesweeping flotilla.

The &quot;Achilles&quot;, &quot;Leander&quot;, and initially served as troop-convoy escorts in the Pacific in early 1942. In January 1942, &quot;Monowai&quot; inconclusively engaged a Japanese submarine off Fiji. On 4 January 1943, a Japanese bomber destroyed the aft gun-house of &quot;Achilles&quot; off Guadalcanal. In January 1943, a morale-boosting episode occurred: the duel &quot;Kiwi&quot; and &quot;Moa&quot; fought with the much larger . Unable to pierce the &quot;I-1&quot;, the &quot;Kiwi&quot; rammed her three times, destroying her ability to dive. &quot;Moa&quot; then hounded &quot;I-1&quot; onto a reef, where she broke up. In April 1943, an aerial attack sunk the &quot;Moa&quot; in Tulagi Harbour in the Solomons. The &quot;Tui&quot; participated in the sinking of the 2,200-ton before joining the &quot;Kiwi&quot; in redeploying to New Guinea, while the corvette went to the Ellice Islands.

The &quot;Leander&quot; helped sink the in the Battle of Kolombangara on the night of 11–12 July 1943. Holed by a Japanese torpedo during the engagement, the &quot;Leander&quot; withdrew to Auckland for repairs. Twelve New Zealand built Fairmile launches of the 80th and 81st Motor Launch Flotillas went forward in early 1944.

The cruiser bombarded Sabang (in Sumatra) in July 1944, and with the recommissioned &quot;Achilles&quot; joined the British Pacific Fleet, later re-inforced by the corvette . The Fleet detached &quot;Achilles&quot; to tow the damaged destroyer &quot;Ulster&quot; to the New Zealand Hospital Ship &quot;Maunganui&quot; in the Philippines (where the was at that time stationed). Both &quot;Gambia&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot; bombarded Japanese positions in the Sakishima Group in May 1945. They were supported by 100 New Zealanders in the Fleet Air Arm operating from British carriers. The &quot;Achilles&quot; left the fleet for Manus Island on 10 August. &quot;Gambia&quot; was off Tokyo on VJ day, and was attacked by a Japanese plane while flying the &quot;Cease hostilities&quot; signal – with assistance from surrounding ships, &quot;Gambia&quot; shot down the aircraft but was hit by the debris.

The &quot;Gambia&quot; represented New Zealand at the surrender ceremonies in Tokyo Bay (2 September 1945), and stayed as part of the occupation force. Air Vice-Marshal Isitt signed the surrender document on behalf of New Zealand. By the end of the war the RNZN had 60 vessels, most of them light craft.

== Royal New Zealand Air Force in World War II ==

=== European theatre ===

On the outbreak of World War II the RNZAF had as its primary equipment 30 Vickers Wellington bombers, which the New Zealand government offered to the United Kingdom in August 1939, together with the crews to fly them. These formed the nucleus of No. 75 Squadron, the first of the Dominion squadrons to serve with the RAF during the war.
Many other New Zealanders also served in the RAF. As New Zealand did not require its personnel to serve with RNZAF squadrons, the rate at which they entered service was faster than for other Dominions. About 100 RNZAF pilots had been sent to Europe by the time the Battle of Britain started, and several had a notable role in it.

The RNZAF&#x27;s primary role took advantage of New Zealand&#x27;s distance from the conflict by training aircrew as part of the Empire Air Training Scheme, alongside the other major former British colonies, Canada, Australia, and South Africa. Many New Zealanders did their advanced training in Canada. Local enterprises manufactured or assembled large numbers of De Havilland Tiger Moth, Airspeed Oxford and North American Harvard training aircraft, and the RNZAF also acquired second-hand biplanes such as Hawker Hinds and Vickers Vincents, as well as other types for specialised training such as Avro Ansons and Supermarine Walruses. Only when German surface-raiders became active did the military authorities realise the need for a combat force in New Zealand in addition to the trainers.

==== New Zealand squadrons of the RAF ====

Once trained, the majority of RNZAF aircrew served with ordinary units of the RAF or of the Fleet Air Arm. As in World War I, they served in all theatres. At least 78 became aces. New Zealanders in the RNZAF and RAF included pilots such as the first RAF ace of WW2, Flying Officer Cobber Kain, Alan Deere, whose &quot;Nine Lives&quot; was one of the first post war accounts of combat, and leaders such as World War I ace, Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Park, who commanded 11 Group, responsible for the defence of London in the Battle of Britain, the air defence of Malta and in the closing stages of the war, the RAF in South East Asia. Through accident or design, several RAF units came to be mostly manned by RNZAF pilots (for example No. 243 Squadron RAF in Singapore, No. 258 Squadron RAF in the UK and several Wildcat and Hellcat units of the FAA – leading some texts to claim these types of aircraft were used by the RNZAF).

The Royal Air Force deliberately set aside certain squadrons for pilots from particular countries. The first of these, 75 Squadron, comprised the Wellingtons and pilots lent by New Zealand in August 1939, which later flew Short Stirlings, Avro Lancasters and Avro Lincolns. Other New Zealand squadrons within the RAF included 485, which flew Supermarine Spitfires throughout the war, 486 (Hawker Hurricanes, Hawker Typhoons and Hawker Tempests), 487 (Lockheed Venturas and De Havilland Mosquitoes), 488 (Brewster Buffaloes, Hurricanes, Bristol Beaufighters and De Havilland Mosquitoes), 489 (Bristol Blenheims, Bristol Beauforts, Handley Page Hampdens, Beaufighters, and Mosquitoes), and 490 (Consolidated Catalinas and Short Sunderlands).

=== RNZAF in the Pacific ===
The presence of German raiders led to the formation of New Zealand-based air-combat units – initially using re-armed types like the Vildebeest, and hurriedly converting impressed airliners such as the DH86 to carry bombs. RNZAF obtained Lockheed Hudsons early in 1941 to take over this role. 5 Squadron with Vickers Vincents and Short Singapores was sent to Fiji to protect that colony.

In December 1941, Japan attacked and rapidly conquered much of the area to the north of New Zealand. New Zealand had perforce to look to her own defence as well as help the &quot;mother country&quot;. Trainers in New Zealand such as the North American Harvard, Hawker Hind and even the de Havilland Tiger Moth were camouflaged and armed. Hudsons moved forward, while 5 Squadron in Fiji, commenced operations against the Japanese despite its obsolete equipment.

The Imperial Japanese Navy demonstrated the vulnerability of New Zealand when submarine-launched Japanese float-planes overflew Wellington and Auckland in 1942. In March a Glen floatplane from I-25 overflew Wellington on 8 March and Auckland on 13 March, then Suva, Fiji on 17 March. The submarine was not seen by the Wellington-Nelson ferry when navigating Cook Strait on the surface on a full-moon night. In May a floatplane from I-21 overflew Suva on 19 May and then Auckland on 24 May. Lost in heavy fog the pilot (Matsumora) was helped by airport staff who heard a plane apparently in trouble and turned on the runway lights so allowing the pilot to find his bearings. During one March or May 1942 overflight a Tiger Moth apparently gave chase ineffectually.

As few combat-capable aircraft were available at home, and Britain was unable to help, New Zealand benefited from the British-United States lend-lease agreement. Gradually, America supplied New Zealand with aircraft for use in the Pacific Theatre. The early lend-lease aircraft were obsolescent models like the Brewster Buffalo which were no match for the skilled and well-equipped Japanese pilots, although the Brewster was successfully used by Geoffrey Fisken the top New Zealand and Commonwealth ace in the Pacific.

From mid-1943 at Guadalcanal, starting with No 15 and No 14 squadrons, several Kittyhawks units fought with distinction. Several RNZAF pilots became aces against the Japanese, including Geoff Fisken, the Commonwealth&#x27;s leading ace in the Pacific war. Other squadrons flew the elderly but effective Douglas Dauntless and later the big, modern Grumman Avenger torpedo-bomber.

The RNZAF took on a major part of the maritime reconnaissance task too, with Catalina (and later Sunderland) flying-boats and Hudson bombers.

The role of the RNZAF changed as the allies moved off the defensive. The Americans, prominent amongst the Allied nations in the Pacific, planned to bypass major Japanese strongholds, but instead to capture a handful of island bases to provide a supply-chain for an eventual attack on Japan itself (see island hopping). The Allied advance started from the South Pacific. The RNZAF became part of the force tasked with securing the line of advance by incapacitating the bypassed Japanese strongholds.

As the war progressed, more powerful modern aircraft replaced the older types; Kittyhawks gave way to Corsairs and Hudsons to Venturas. At its peak in the Pacific, the RNZAF had 13 squadrons of Corsair fighters, six of Venturas, two each of Catalinas, Avengers and C-47 Dakotas, one using Dauntless dive bombers, mixed transport and communications squadrons, a flight of Short Sunderlands and nearly 1,000 training machines. By 1945, the RNZAF had over 41,000 personnel, including just over 10,000 aircrew who served with the RAF in Europe and Africa.

== Intelligence ==
New Zealand had a &quot;Combined Intelligence Centre&quot; in Wellington. In 1942 papers from the centre to the Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet in Colombo and the RN signals intelligence at Anderson outside Colombo were captured on the Australian steamer &quot;Nankin&quot; when she was intercepted in the Indian Ocean by the German raider &quot;Thor&quot;.

In the 1930s the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy established a chain of radio direction finding (D/F) stations from Awarua Radio on the Awarua Plains in Southland, Musick Point near Auckland, Waipapakauri in the far north and Suva, Fiji. There were radio intercept stations at Awarua, Suva, Nairnville in Khandallah near Wellington, and from 1943 at Waiouru. Transmissions were sent to the Far East Combined Bureau via the Navy Office in Wellington.

New Zealand&#x27;s network of radio intercept and D/F stations sent its material to Central Bureau in Brisbane despite its main area of responsibility being outside the SWPA. The network was supplemented in 1943 by a Radio Finger-Printing (RFP) organisation staffed by members of the Women&#x27;s Royal New Zealand Naval Service (&quot;Wrens&quot;). These were valuable for identifying Japanese submarines, and RFP alerted the minesweepers HMNZS &quot;Kiwi&quot; and HMNZS &quot;Moa&quot;, who attacked and rammed the Japanese submarine &quot;I-1&quot; running supplies to Guadalcanal on 29 January 1943.
In 1943 the New Zealand (naval) operation was run by a Lieutenant Philpott assisted by Professor Campbell (Professor of Mathematics at Victoria University of Wellington) plus a part-time civilian Japanese interpreter and two women assistants &quot;both of whom were of above average ability and one of whom knew quite a bit of Japanese&quot;. It was said to be &quot;remarkably productive&quot; despite its small size and apparent lack of assistance or direction from FRUMEL in Melbourne (where Rudi Fabian was reluctant to cooperate with the Royal Navy or the US Army&#x27;s Central Bureau).

== Research ==
Several military research projects were conducted in New Zealand during World War II, notably a joint US/NZ project in 1944–45 called Project Seal to develop a tsunami bomb.

<doc id="607554" wikidata="Q7918620" url="?curid=607554" title="Vehicular homicide">
<text>Vehicular homicide is a crime that involves the death of a person other than the driver as a result of either criminally negligent or murderous operation of a motor vehicle.

In cases of criminal negligence, the defendant is commonly charged with unintentional vehicular manslaughter.

Vehicular homicide is similar to the offense, in some countries, of &quot;dangerous driving causing death&quot;.

The victim may be either a person not in the car with the offending motorist (such as a pedestrian, cyclist, or another motorist), or a passenger in the vehicle with the offender.

==Jurisdictions==

===Canada===

The Criminal Code of Canada does not have a specific offence for vehicular homicide, but has a series of provisions covering driving offences causing death, among them:
* dangerous driving causing death
* criminal negligence causing death 
* failure to stop for police causing death
* street racing causing death
* impaired driving causing death
* hit and run driving causing death

The maximum penalty for dangerous driving causing death, absent any of the remaining 5 elements mentioned above, is 14 years&#x27; imprisonment. The maximum penalty is otherwise life imprisonment. There is no minimum sentence.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there is no offense of &quot;vehicular homicide&quot;. Where a vehicle has been used as a weapon as part of a deliberate assault; and the intention was to kill or cause serious injury; and that assault resulted in the death of the victim then the driver may be charged with murder contrary to the Common Law.

Where death is the result of driving that falls short of a deliberate assault, the Road Traffic Act 1988 (RTA 88) governs the disposal of the case. The offenses created by this act relating to road deaths are as follows ...

* &quot;Causing death by dangerous driving&quot; - Section 1 RTA 88, the only points for the prosecution to prove are that death was caused and the driver of the vehicle that caused the death was driving dangerously.
* &quot;Causing death by careless, or inconsiderate, driving&quot; - Section 2B RTA 88, deals with cases similar in scope to Section 1 but while the standard of the driving remains reprehensible the lapse(s) alleged are considered to fall short of being actually dangerous.
* &quot;Causing death by driving: unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured drivers&quot; - Section 3ZB RTA 88, it is a requirement under UK law for the drivers of motor vehicles to be properly licensed and for them to hold third party insurance for their vehicle. This section was inserted to the RTA 88 to deal with road death cases where there was no provable lapse in driving standards but nevertheless the driver should not in law have been driving.
* and &quot;Causing death by careless driving while unfit through alcohol/over prescribed limit&quot;, Section 3A RTA 88

The RTA 88 introduced the simple concept of dangerousness by removing the offence of &quot;reckless driving&quot; as the concept of recklessness in UK law requires a mens rea. This had been difficult to prove in court. C. M. V. Clarkson, an advocate of a vehicular homicide offense, opines that while people&#x27;s perceptions are that death resulting from a motor vehicle is in a different &quot;family&quot; to other killings, &quot;in terms of fault there can be little distinction between those who kill through the dangerous operation of their cars and those who kill with machines, trains, etc.&quot;

In addition to the above there also exists the option of charging offenders with causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving.

Originally framed in the era of horse-drawn vehicles this legislation is now applied where offences involving motorised vehicles take place outside the provisions of the Road Traffic Act (on private land, when driving off-road or in pedestrianised areas) and in the small number of serious cases involving non-motorised collisions such as the few that involve cyclists and result in severe injury or loss of life, typically of pedestrians.

===United States===
The definition and penalties of vehicular manslaughter in the United States vary by state.

All states except Alaska, Montana, and Arizona have vehicular homicide statutes. The laws have the effect of making a vehicle a potentially deadly weapon, to allow for easier conviction and more severe penalties; in states without such statutes, defendants can still be charged with manslaughter or murder in some situations.

In the Model Penal Code, there is no distinction between vehicular homicide and vehicular homicides that involve negligence; instead, both are included in the overall category of negligent homicide.

====California====
In the state of California, depending on the degree of recklessness and whether alcohol was involved, a person could be charged with progressively more serious offenses: vehicular manslaughter, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, or second-degree murder. In any of these cases, the prosecution must prove that the driver committed some wrongful act (which could be a felony, a misdemeanor, an infraction, or a lawful act that might cause death) and that the wrongful act caused the collision and the death of the victim. Murder charges are usually reserved for the most egregious cases, such as a convicted DUI offender who drives recklessly while intoxicated and thereby causes a fatal collision.

====Georgia====
In the state of Georgia, vehicular homicide is more properly known as homicide by vehicle. It is defined, by statute, as the unlawful killing of another person using a vehicle. To be guilty of the offense, the perpetrator does not have to have an intent to kill, malice aforethought, or premeditation.

There are two degrees of vehicular homicide:
;First degree homicide by vehicle: This is a felony that, upon conviction, will result in a sentence of between 3 and 15 years of imprisonment (or between 5 and 20 years for habitual violators), with no parole for at least 1 year. A homicide is first degree homicide by vehicle if the driver &quot;unlawfully met or overtook a school bus; unlawfully failed to stop after a collision; was driving recklessly; was driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs; failed to stop for, or otherwise was attempting to flee from, a law enforcement officer; or had previously been declared a habitual violator&quot;.
;Second degree homicide by vehicle: This is a misdemeanor that, upon conviction, will result in a sentence of up to 1 year (which may be suspended), a fine of up to US$1,000, or both. Second degree homicide by vehicle encompasses all other homicides by vehicle, involving any other violation of the laws governing motor vehicles, that are not classed as first degree homicides.

====Kentucky====
In Kentucky, vehicular homicide is defined under KRS 507.060(1) as (a) causing the death of another and (b) &quot;The death results from the person&#x27;s operation of a motor vehicle, including but not limited to boats and airplanes, under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance, or other substance which impairs driving ability as described in KRS 189A.010.&quot; Vehicular homicide is a Class B felony punishable by 10 to 20 years in prison and a fine of between $1,000 and $10,000.

In addition, KRS 532.036 allows courts to order individuals convicted of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol or drugs as defined KRS 189A.010 to pay financial support to the minor children of victims if the victim is killed or disabled. Financial support is permitted until the child is eighteen years old unless the child is enrolled in high school. In this case, financial support may be ordered until the child graduates from high school or turns nineteen years old. 

====Louisiana====
In the state of Louisiana, vehicular homicide is defined as the killing of a human being while operating a motor vehicle, or other means of conveyance, under the influence of alcohol and/or controlled substances. The minimum punishment is a fine of at least $2,000 (not more than $15,000) and 5–30 years in prison.

The law is LSA RS 14:32.1.

====Minnesota====
In the state of Minnesota, vehicular homicide is one of the six levels of criminal vehicular operation, and is defined as causing the death of a person, that does not constitute murder or manslaughter, as a result of operating a motor vehicle in a grossly negligent manner, or in a negligent manner while in violation of the driving while intoxicated law, or where the driver flees the scene in violation of the felony fleeing law. Vehicular homicide in Minnesota requires, at a minimum, a &quot;mens rea&quot; of gross negligence.

====Washington====
Vehicular homicide in Washington state, is governed by &quot;RCW 46.61.520 Vehicular homicide—Penalty.&quot; as follow:

::&quot;(1) When the death of any person ensues within three years as a proximate result of injury proximately caused by the driving of any vehicle by any person, the driver is guilty of vehicular homicide if the driver was operating a motor vehicle:&quot;

:::&quot;a While under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug, as defined by RCW 46.61.502; or&quot;
:::&quot;b In a reckless manner; or&quot;
:::&quot;c With disregard for the safety of others.&quot;

::&quot;(2) Vehicular homicide is a class A felony punishable under chapter 9A.20 RCW, except that, for a conviction under subsection (1)(a) of this section, an additional two years shall be added to the sentence for each prior offence as defined in RCW 46.61.5055.&quot;

====Sentencing====
A study by professors at Dartmouth College and Harvard University found that those convicted of vehicular homicide are given, on average, shorter sentences than those found guilty of other types of homicide. The study found that the gender of the offender does not statistically affect the length of the sentence, but the race does. The identity of the victim is a more important predictor of sentencing length, with longer sentences given to offenders in cases where the victim was female and/or had no violent criminal record.

Some states, such as Minnesota, have statutes allowing for a charge of a vehicular homicide if an unborn child is killed or injured by a motorist.
