<text>Hazen Shirley Cuyler (; August 30, 1898 – February 11, 1950), nicknamed &quot;Kiki&quot;, was an American professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, and Brooklyn Dodgers from 1921 until 1938.

Cuyler led the National League (NL) in stolen bases four times, runs scored two times and had a batting average of over .350 on four occasions. His 26 triples in 1925 were the second most triples in any season after 1900. He compiled over 200 hits in three separate seasons and won the World Series in 1925 with the Pirates. A career .321 hitter, he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1968 by the Veterans Committee.

==Early life==
Cuyler was born in Harrisville, Michigan, on August 30, 1898, to George and Anna Cuyler. George and Anna were born in Canada, where George played semi-professional baseball. His ancestors relocated there at the start of the Revolutionary War, then later moved to Michigan in the 1880s. While in school, Cuyler excelled in baseball, football, basketball and athletics. He did not drink or smoke throughout school. After school Cuyler attended West Point for three months until he moved back to Michigan to work at a Buick Motors assembly plant in Flint. He played for the Buick plant baseball team as well as in the Industrial League which had games in Flint and Detroit. The Bay City Wolves, of the Michigan-Ontario League, signed Cuyler to a contract in 1920. In that season he had a batting average of .317 and compiled 16 triples. In September of that year his contract was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates.

==Career==
===Pittsburgh Pirates===
He appeared briefly in the major leagues with the Pittsburgh Pirates over the next three seasons, but still spent the majority of each season in the minor leagues. He hit .340 in 1923 for the Nashville Vols of the Southern Association. It was in Nashville that his nickname had taken hold with the fans. Two explanations have been given for the origin of Cuyler&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Kiki&quot;. In the first version, he had been known as &quot;Cuy&quot; since high school. When a fly ball was hit to the Nashville outfield and it was judged to be Cuyler&#x27;s play, the shortstop would call out &quot;Cuy&quot; and this call would be echoed by the second baseman. The echoed name caught on with Nashville&#x27;s fans. In the second explanation, &quot;Kiki Cuyler&quot; came from the player&#x27;s stuttering problem and the way it sounded when Cuyler said his own last name.

He was promoted to the Pirates for his first full major league season in 1924. He played a platoon outfield position, splitting time with Carson Bigbee. At the end of May he had batted .400 over his first 13 games and earned a spot as a starting outfielder. On August 9, 1924 he compiled six hits, three of which were doubles and one triple, in a 16–4 win over the Philadelphia Phillies. At the end of the season he had a batting average of .354, and scored 94 runs and stolen 32 bases in only 117 games played. Former Pittsburgh manager and Hall of Famer Fred Clarke said that &quot;Cuyler might become a second [Ty] Cobb&quot;
On June 4, 1925 Cuyler hit for the cycle, walked and stole a base in a 16–3 win over the Phillies. Later that year in August, Cuyler hit two inside-the-park home runs in a single game at Baker Bowl, the very compact baseball stadium in Philadelphia. From September 18–20, 1925 he tied the NL record by recording a hit in ten straight at bats. He hit eight inside-the-park home runs, and led the league with 144 runs scored and triples with 26, his .357 average was a career high and it was the second time he hit over .350 in his career. His 369 total bases in 1925 set a Pirates team record. The Pirates won the NL Pennant and faced the Washington Senators in the 1925 World Series. Cuyler only hit .269 in the World Series, but his two-run double in the bottom of the eighth inning of game seven scored the deciding runs, the Pirates won Game 7 9–7. This was the only time Cuyler would win a World Series.

Paul Waner joined the Pirates and took over the right field position in April 1926, forcing Cuyler to center and left field. The start of the 1926 season was strong for Cuyler, who by June 11 was batting .381, but finished poorly as he batted only .299 in the second half. The middle of the season was a turning point for Cuyler and the team, when on August 11, Babe Adams, Carson Bigbee and team captain and Hall of Famer Max Carey voted in a petition to remove vice president Fred Clarke from games. The result of the vote was 18–6 in favor of keeping Clarke, and all three players were released on August 13. The Pirates finished the rest of their season 23–24 and Cuyler batted only .288 after the incident. In his third full season Cuyler led the league in stolen bases, runs scored and finished with a .321 batting average.

On May 28, 1927 Cuyler experienced the first of his many injuries he would suffer from in his career when he tore ligaments in his ankle and was sidelined for 3 weeks. He had argued with first-year manager Donie Bush throughout the season and on August 6, when he did not break up a double play he was fined $50 ($ in current dollar terms) by manager Bush. After a missed cutoff throw, Bush benched Cuyler for the season. Cuyler appeared in 10 games for the rest of the season mainly as a pinch hitter. The Pirates made the World Series in 1927, but due to the dispute with Donie Bush, Cuyler did not play a single game in the series and remained on the bench despite fans wanting him to play. That November, Cuyler was traded to the Chicago Cubs for infielder Sparky Adams and outfielder Pete Scott.

===Chicago Cubs and later career===
With the Cubs, Cuyler played his natural position of right field, and batted third in the lineup. He suffered an ankle injury which caused him to only hit .285, although he did lead the league in stolen bases for the second time in his career. During the 1928 season, Cuyler formed a quartet with teammates Cliff Heathcote and Hall of Famers Gabby Hartnett and Hack Wilson. Johnny Pesky, who Cuyler coached with the 1949 Boston Red Sox, remarked &quot;He had a beautiful voice, he&#x27;d sing all the time, sing in the showers, sing in the locker rooms...&quot; In 1929 he returned for a fully healthy season, and played in the most games since 1926. He led the league in stolen bases for the third time and hit .360 which marked the third time he batted over .350 in his career. Cuyler returned to the World Series, he hit .300 for the series, but the Cubs lost the series 1 game to 4.
In 1930 Cuyler set career highs in hits (228), runs scored (155), and RBI (134), and led the league in stolen bases for the fourth and final time in his career. With a career year from Hack Wilson, who set a major league record with 191 RBI, the Cubs could not manage to win the pennant and were behind the St. Louis Cardinals two games at the end of the season. The following year was also successful for Cuyler, he collected over 200 hits for the third time in his career and it would also be the last time he played in more than 150 games for the rest of his career. In early 1932 Cuyler fractured a toe on his left foot when he rounded first base and was out for six weeks. On August 31, 1932 Cuyler had one of the best games of his career. In the bottom of the ninth inning, with two outs, down 5–4 against the Giants, Cuyler singled home the tying run, which raised his hit total to 4 for the game. The Giants scored 4 runs in the top of the tenth inning. After two straight outs to start the bottom of the tenth inning, teammate Mark Koenig hit a solo home run, this was followed by three straight singles. Cuyler came up to bat with two runners on, down 9–7 and hit a three-run game-winning home run. He finished the game going 5-for-6 with five runs batted in.

Cuyler suffered another injury, this time during an exhibition game on March 29, 1933. He slid into a base during a steal attempt and fractured his right fibula, and was sidelined until July of that year. He hit .317 for his shortened season, but his speed was gone, in part due to age and his injury history. He stole 4 bases that year in 70 games. Cuyler was healthy the next season, he hit a league leading 42 doubles and hit .338 over 140 games. After a poor performance in the first half of the 1935 season, where he hit .268, he was released by the Cubs. As a free agent, he was signed by the Cincinnati Reds in July 1935. His first full year with the Reds was productive and he hit .326 in 1936 with 185 hits over 144 games. His 16 stolen bases that year were the most since he led the league in 1930 with 37. Another broken bone, this time his cheekbone, happened in spring training and his 1937 season was limited to 117 games, where he did not record a home run for the first time since 1923 when he played 11 games. After being released by the Reds in October, he decided to retire from baseball at the end of the season. The next season he was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as the oldest player in the NL. He started 58 games in 1938 for the Dodgers, and was released on September 16 of that year. He was signed as a coach for the rest of the season.

==Later life and legacy==
After the end of his playing career, Cuyler managed in the minor leagues, winning the regular-season Southern Association pennant in 1939 under Joe Engel with the Chattanooga Lookouts, with one of the only fan-owned franchises in the nation. He was a coach for the Cubs (1941–1943) and the Boston Red Sox (1949), and was in line to be the third base coach for Boston heading into the 1950 season. He suffered a heart attack while ice fishing in Glennie, Michigan, on February 2, 1950. While at the hospital he developed a blood clot in his leg, and when it worsened he was sent to a hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan; he died en route on February 11, 1950. His remains are interred in Saint Anne Cemetery in Harrisville Township, Michigan.

Cuyler finished his career with a .321 batting average, 1,305 runs, 2,299 hits, 394 doubles, 157 triples, 128 home runs, 1,065 RBI, 676 walks and 328 stolen bases. He collected over 200 hits in three separate seasons, and led the league in runs scored two times. Cuyler recorded one six-hit game, five five-hit games, and 31 four-hit games, ten of which were recorded in 1925. His 228 hits and 155 runs scored in 1930 were second most in Cubs history, and his 50 doubles that year set a team record. His .336 career average with the Pirates is third all time and his 220 hits in 1925 tied the single-season team record. He batted over .300 ten times in his major league career.

Cuyler was known around the league as a polite, shy and kind player. Hall of Famer Joe Cronin said of Cuyler, &quot;He was one of the finest and cleanest living fellows I ever met in baseball. Cuyler was an established star when I joined the Pirates in 1925 but he was always willing to help.&quot; &quot;The Sporting News&quot; stated that Cuyler was &quot;a model on and off the field&quot; Cuyler was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1968.

In Harrisville, Cuyler&#x27;s son Harold opened a restaurant after his father&#x27;s death, called Ki Cuyler&#x27;s Bar &amp; Grill, and he owned and operated it for a time. It operated until it burned down in December 2018. In 2008, State Highway M-72 within Alcona County was named the &quot;Hazen Shirley &#x27;Kiki&#x27; Cuyler Memorial Highway&quot;.

<doc id="587154" wikidata="Q2022515" url="?curid=587154" title="Electional astrology">
<text>Electional astrology, also known as &quot;event&quot; astrology, is a branch found in most traditions of astrology according to which a practitioner decides the most appropriate time for an event based on the astrological auspiciousness of that time. It differs from horary astrology because, while horary astrologers seek to find the answer to a question based on the time the question was asked, electional astrologers seek to find a period of time which will result in the most preferable outcome for an event being planned.

Historically used primarily to schedule battles, electional astrology has been used by its proponents to plan a number of events, including weddings and trips.

Modern discoveries about the true nature of celestial objects has undermined theoretical bases for believing that their motions affect luck, and empirical scientific investigation has shown that predictions and recommendations based on these systems are not accurate. Astrology in general counts as a pseudoscience.

==History==
A rudimentary form of electional astrology was used by the Babylonians beginning sometime after the 16th century BCE. This and other Babylonian forms of astrology were passed on to the Egyptians, and Persians; Early Vedic astrologers also used a sophisticated form of electional astrology known as Muhurta (Muhurat) that was used for choosing the start of yajnas, travel, warfare, marriage and even filmmaking (muhurat shot) etc.

Modern electional astrology, as well as most other astrology, can in general be traced directly back to Book Five of Dorotheus of Sidon&#x27;s treatises in Greek on the subject, &quot;Carmen Astrologicum&quot; from the 1st Century CE. This is the oldest treatise on electional astrology.

==Practice==
In electional astrology, an astrologer is given an event the querent intends to plan. The astrologer then finds a date and time most auspicious for the event to take place, around which the querent bases the following plans. The method of coming to these conclusions is based on the relative positions of stars, planets and other celestial bodies at various times. Each celestial body&#x27;s placement means something particular to the tradition the individual astrologer is using, in combination with the natal chart of the querent.

===Event chart===
An event chart is a horoscope that is cast for the date, time and place of a particular event. Such a chart is interpreted to gain insight into influences surrounding the event and an outlook for possible developments stemming from that event.

For example, astrologers can erect a chart for a major event, such as a marriage, and interpret it as though the event were a person in its own right. For example, if a chart was cast for the date of one&#x27;s marriage then the chart would give an indication of what the couple can expect during their married life. If a chart is cast for a national event then one can interpret the chart to determine influences surrounding the event. This is in contrast to a birth chart, which is calculated for the actual time of a person&#x27;s birth, but the design and interpretation are similar.

==Branches==
Elections, or predictions for auspicious times, are usually divided into three branches, which are used depending on the type of event being planned.

===Radical elections===
Radical elections rest on the assumption that an election should be performed primarily based on the natal chart of the querent or person for whom the election is being performed. An underlying assumption of radical elections is that, because each person was born under different astrological conditions, the most auspicious time to hold an event will be different for each.

===Mundane elections===
Mundane elections involve using prominent mundane horoscopes (&quot;mundane astrology&quot; is concerned with world affairs) in force at the time for which the election is made.

===Ephemeral elections===
The most commonly used and distinctive form of election is the ephemeral election. These involve picking a date for an event based on the position of the celestial bodies in the sky at the moment of the event. Most of the time, when a person is talking about electional astrology, that person is referring to ephemeral elections. They can be described as &quot;an horary chart set for a certain time &quot;in the future.&quot;&quot;

====Magical elections====
Ephemeral elections have been used in ancient and modern times to make talismans and seals. These items were seen to be imbued with the qualities of the auspicious date during which they were made, and their instruction is commonly found in medieval literature.

<text>Kay Hanley (born September 11, 1968) is an American singer and songwriter. She is best known as the vocalist for the alternative rock band Letters to Cleo.

==Life and career==
Hanley grew up in Dorchester, Massachusetts, across the street from the Wahlberg family. She attended school at St. Gregory&#x27;s and Latin Academy. She has been lead singer/songwriter for rock band Letters To Cleo since 1990. The band name was inspired by Hanley&#x27;s childhood penpal.

In 1996, she co-starred alongside Gary Cherone in Boston Rock Opera&#x27;s performance of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; as Mary Magdalene.

In 1999, Hanley appeared as herself in the film &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;, singing a cover version of Nick Lowe&#x27;s &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot; to Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles at their characters&#x27; high school prom, in addition to performing original song &quot;Come On&quot; with Letters to Cleo during an earlier scene at a club. Towards the end of the 90s she began performing with her then-husband and fellow Letters To Cleo member Michael Eisenstein outside of the band. Around the same time, she gave birth to their daughter, Zoe Mabel.

==Songwriting==

In 1999 Hanley began a shift in her music career. She wrote and performed songs for the Kids&#x27; WB cartoon series &quot;Generation O!&quot; along with the rest of Letters to Cleo and provided the singing voice for Rachael Leigh Cook&#x27;s character Josie in the movie &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;. In 2002, she released her first solo album, &quot;Cherry Marmalade&quot;. That same year, she appeared on the Dropkick Murphys/Face to Face split CD, providing guest vocals on the original version of the Dropkick Murphys song &quot;The Dirty Glass&quot;.

In 2003, Hanley was approached by Jun Senoue from Sega to co-write and perform on an original song for their upcoming entry in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, entitled &quot;Sonic Heroes&quot;. The result was the song &quot;Follow Me.&quot;

In 2004, Hanley released a follow-up to Cherry Marmalade, &quot;The Babydoll EP&quot;. That same year, she and her then-husband Michael Eisenstein had their second child, Henry Aaron, the name given in honor of baseball player Hank Aaron and their love for baseball.

In August 2005, Hanley recorded a cover of Iggy Pop&#x27;s &quot;Lust for Life&quot; for the soundtrack of the Reese Witherspoon film &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;. In September 2005, she appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; as part of a pre-taped man-on-the-street segment, singing a song about falling in love at Starbucks.

Hanley is popular with fans of the New England Patriots thanks to the team at one point going after she sang the pre-game National Anthem at Gillette Stadium. The streak came to an end when the Patriots lost on January 10, 2010, to the Baltimore Ravens. Hanley is also very involved with the Boston-based charity &quot;Hot Stove, Cool Music,&quot; both as performer and spokesperson for the semi-annual event, which has raised over 6 million dollars for The Foundation To Be Named Later

She sang the theme song for &quot;My Friends Tigger &amp; Pooh&quot;, a half-hour Disney Channel TV show that premiered on Playhouse Disney on May 12, 2007, and &quot;We Are Care Bears&quot; from &quot;Care Bears: Oopsy Does It!&quot; and &quot;Care Bears to the Rescue&quot;.

Hanley and longtime writing partner Michelle Lewis currently compose all-original songs for animated television shows such as the hit Disney series &quot;Doc McStuffins&quot;.,
Cartoon Network/WB&#x27;s &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot;, and &quot;Harvey Girls Forever&quot; and &quot;Ada Twist, Scientist&quot; on Netflix.
Hanley won a 2022 Emmy Award for songwriting on We The People.

She and writing partners Michelle Lewis, Dan Petty, and Charlton Pettus created Kindergarten The Musical. In production at Disney Junior, the show will debut in fall 2024. Hanley serves as executive producer.

She is co-executive director of Songwriters of North America, an LA-based non-profit which advocates for fair pay and other rights for songwriters. Due to her work with SONA in getting the Music Modernization Act passed into law in October 2018, Hanley was elected Vice Chair of the Mechanical Licensing Collective&#x27;s Unclaimed Royalties Oversight Committee in August 2019

On Thanksgiving Day 2007, Hanley sang a song called &quot;Caring Changes The World&quot; in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade on the Care Bears float.

In 2007–08, Hanley toured as a back-up singer with Miley Cyrus for Hannah Montana concerts and events.

Hanley&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Weaponize&quot;, was released May 27, 2008.

Hanley co-wrote &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Be Famous&quot; on the band The Dollyrots&#x27; eponymous album.

In 2014, Kay Hanley appeared in the &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; season 6 finale, performing her song &quot;Here &amp; Now&quot; at the Pawnee-Eagleton Unity Concert. The character of Ben Wyatt, played by Adam Scott, is seen offstage in his Letters to Cleo t-shirt, blissfully watching the band as Hanley winks at him. Hanley is seen later in the episode entering Tom Haverford&#x27;s new restaurant, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Bistro&quot;.

In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, she appeared as lead vocalist in a &quot;distanced&quot; music video, a cover of Donnie Iris&#x27;s &quot;Ah! Leah!&quot; Later that year, she appeared on &quot;Saving for a Custom Van&quot;, a tribute album for Adam Schlesinger, with whom she had worked on &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, following his death from COVID-19. She performed the Fountains of Wayne song &quot;Radiation Vibe&quot; in his memory.

Hanley married audio engineer Clayton Janes in 2021 in Bentonville, Arkansas.

Oh 2023, Hanley and her fellow Letters to Cleo bandmate Tom Polce wrote the songs for “Subspace Rhapsody,” an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; performed in the style of a broadway musical.

<doc id="587163" wikidata="Q4410516" url="?curid=587163" title="Light-time correction">
<text>Light-time correction is a displacement in the &quot;apparent&quot; position of a celestial object from its &quot;true&quot; position (or geometric position) caused by the object&#x27;s motion during the time it takes its light to reach an observer.

Light-time correction occurs in principle during the observation of any moving object, because the speed of light is finite. The magnitude and direction of the displacement in position depends upon the distance of the object from the observer and the motion of the object, and is measured at the instant at which the object&#x27;s light reaches the observer. It is &quot;independent&quot; of the motion of the observer. It should be contrasted with the aberration of light, which depends upon the instantaneous velocity of the observer at the time of observation, and is independent of the motion or distance of the object.

Light-time correction can be applied to any object whose distance and motion are known. In particular, it is usually necessary to apply it to the motion of a planet or other Solar System object. For this reason, the combined displacement of the apparent position due to the effects of light-time correction and aberration is known as &quot;planetary aberration&quot;. By convention, light-time correction is not applied to the positions of stars, because their motion and distance may not be known accurately.

==Calculation==

A calculation of light-time correction usually involves an iterative process. An approximate light-time is calculated by dividing the object&#x27;s geometric distance from Earth by the speed of light. Then the object&#x27;s velocity is multiplied by this approximate light-time to determine its approximate displacement through space during that time. Its previous position is used to calculate a more precise light-time. This process is repeated as necessary. For planetary motions, a few (3–5) iterations are sufficient to match the accuracy of the underlying ephemerides.

==Discovery==

The effect of the finite speed of light on observations of celestial objects was first recognised by Ole Rømer in 1675, during a series of observations of eclipses of the moons of Jupiter. He found that the interval between eclipses was less when Earth and Jupiter are approaching each other, and more when they are moving away from each other. He correctly deduced that this difference was caused by the appreciable time it took for light to travel from Jupiter to the observer on Earth.

<doc id="587171" wikidata="Q676125" url="?curid=587171" title="Infinite (Eminem album)">
<text>Infinite is the debut studio album by the American rapper Eminem. It was released on November 12, 1996, through Web Entertainment. Recording sessions took place at the Bass Brothers&#x27; studio, with production handled by Denaun Porter and Eminem himself. The album features guest vocals from fellow Detroit rappers Proof, Denaun Porter, Eye-Kyu, Moe Men-E, Three and Thyme, as well as singer Angela Workman.

Physical copies of &quot;Infinite&quot; were released on cassette and vinyl, and Eminem sold the copies from the trunk of his car in Detroit. It is not officially available on any online music stores and only the title track, &quot;Infinite&quot;, has been made available on Spotify. On November 17, 2016, five days after the 20th anniversary of the album, the official Eminem YouTube channel posted a remix of its title track, made by the Bass Brothers, releasing it digitally for the first time. Retrospectively, the album has received mixed reviews from music critics. It was a commercial failure, selling around 1,000 copies. Since the album was made before Eminem garnered mainstream attention and signed to Interscope Records, physical copies have appreciated in value.

==Background and recording==

In 1992, Eminem signed with FBT Productions, which had been run by Jeff and Mark Bass; they are known as the Bass Brothers. Eminem also held a minimum-wage job that involved cooking and washing dishes at Gilbert&#x27;s Lodge restaurant in St. Clair Shores for some time. Inspired by Tupac Shakur&#x27;s &quot;Me Against the World&quot; and Nas&#x27;s &quot;Illmatic&quot;, Eminem began writing &quot;Infinite&quot;. After the birth of his daughter Hailie, 23-year-old Eminem headed to the Bass Brothers basement to record the album. The album was completed by the summer of 1996 and was released on Web Entertainment in the autumn.

Eminem was encouraged by others for the album, noted to sound like Nas and AZ. Mr. Porter produced the majority of the album, while Proof programmed the drums.

==Composition and lyrics==
Eminem purposely made &quot;Infinite&quot;″s songs &quot;radio-friendly&quot; in hopes of getting played on Detroit radio stations; only around a thousand copies of the album were made. Subjects covered on &quot;Infinite&quot; included Eminem, him and his grandma&#x27;s struggle with raising Hailie Jade Mathers, Eminem&#x27;s newborn daughter, while on limited funds and his strong desire to become rich. After the release of &quot;Infinite&quot;, Eminem&#x27;s personal struggles and his abuse of drugs and alcohol resulted in a suicide attempt. Eminem recalled: &quot;Obviously, I was young and influenced by other artists, and I got a lot of feedback saying that I sounded like AZ. &quot;Infinite&quot; was me trying to figure out how I wanted my rap style to be, how I wanted to sound on the mic and present myself. It was a growing stage. I felt like &quot;Infinite&quot; was like the demo that just got pressed up.&quot;

==Release and reception==
On November 12, 1996, &quot;Infinite&quot; was released by Web Entertainment. It is not known exactly how many copies &quot;Infinite&quot; sold. Eminem stated in his autobiography &quot;The Way I Am&quot; (2008) that it sold &quot;maybe 70 copies&quot;. However, other sources stated that the album sold a few hundred copies or even a thousand copies. Eminem&#x27;s overall disappointment with &quot;Infinite&quot;″s lack of success inspired him to develop his famous Slim Shady alter ego, which became present in his later works.

On May 14, 2009, &quot;thisis50.com&quot; re-released it for free download on their website to build anticipation for Eminem&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Relapse&quot; (2009); this was his comeback album. On November 17, 2016, a remix of the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Infinite&quot; was released in commemoration of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary five days after the event. The remix was followed by a documentary about the making of &quot;Infinite&quot;, also released the same day.
Retrospective reviews of &quot;Infinite&quot; from music critics were mixed. AllMusic gave it an &quot;Editor Score&quot; of 2.5 out of 5 stars, without a review. Rob Kenner of &quot;Complex&quot; gave the album a mixed review, saying Eminem &quot;has yet to develop his own distinctive style&quot;, and that it was a &quot;competent but unremarkable effort&quot;. Mosi Reeves from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated, that &quot;Probably the most surprising thing on &quot;Infinite&quot; is hearing [Eminem] rap, &#x27;In the midst of this insanity, I found my Christianity through God&#x27; on &#x27;It&#x27;s O.K., noting that spiritual elements had not played a large role in his later works&#x27; lyrics. According to Christian hip-hop media outlet Rapzilla, Eminem would pray before shows in the early 2000s. On a 2022 remix of Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Use This Gospel&quot;, Eminem raps faith-based lines such as &quot;I put all of my trust and faith in You, Father,&quot; and &quot;my Savior I call on to rescue me ... He is my shepherd. I&#x27;m armed with Jesus, my weapon is prayer.&quot;

In a more positive review, Tedd Maider of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; describes &quot;Infinite&quot; as &quot;a more genuine glimpse of the rapper that is Eminem&quot;, and commented that it is &quot;quick-witted and unique rhyming&quot;, &quot;lyrical chops, raw style beats, and mentality&quot; could only be matched by his third studio album &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; (2000).

<text>Bsharri ( &quot;Bšarrī&quot;; also romanized &quot;Becharre&quot;, &quot;Bcharre&quot;, &quot;Bsharre&quot;, &quot;Bcharre Al Arz&quot;) is a Lebanese town located in the district of the same name, North Governorate, situated at altitudes between and . Bsharri is the location of the Cedars of God, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the only remaining place where the &quot;Cedrus libani&quot; (Lebanese cedar) tree grows natively. The region is the birthplace of famed poet, painter and sculptor Khalil Gibran; a museum in town honours his life and work.

As Bsharri is mountainous and experiences freezing winters, it is home to Lebanon&#x27;s oldest ski resort, the Cedars Ski Resort, as well as the country&#x27;s original ski lift, which was built in 1953. The resort is about 130 km (81 mi) from Beirut, approximately two hours&#x27; driving time. &quot;Qurnat as Sawdā&quot; Mountain is the highest peak in the Levant, at 3,088 meters above sea level.

Bsharri is at the head of the Holy Kadisha Valley, a natural area which contains some of the oldest Christian monastic communities in the Middle East. A center of Maronite Christianity, the area also features the largest cathedral in the Levant region, the Saint Saba Cathedral, constructed by Anthony II Peter Arida. As the city is home to nearly 40 churches and houses-of-worship, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;the city of churches&quot;.

== History ==

 Maronite Christians fleeing persecution sought refuge in its mountainous terrain in the 7th Century AD. The Kadisha Valley, below the town, became the spiritual center of the Maronite Church. The town was known as Buissera by the Crusades.

Residents of Bsharri are known for their distinct accent when they speak Lebanese Arabic. Unlike other parts of Lebanon, Aramaic was spoken in Bsharri as a liturgical language well into the 19th century. As a result, Bsharri natives developed an unmistakably strong accent that lasts to this day.

During the Lebanese civil war, many young men joined the Lebanese Phalanges. In 1986 Samir Geagea, a Bsharri native, became head of the Lebanese Forces (LF) militia (now a political party). Many LF militants were drawn from the town during the civil war.

== Culture ==
Today, the town is located in a highly touristic zone including many attractions such as the Khalil Gibran Museum, the Kadisha Valley, the Kadisha Grotto, the Cedars of God forest and several ski resorts.
Bsharri is home to a Lebanese Red Cross First Aid Center, also to “The Maronite Scouts” that started their activities in early 2000.
On July 13, 2018, International Colombian singer of Lebanese heritage, Shakira, performed in Bsharri during the Cedars International Festival in the presence of 13,000 people. The visit was a part of her 2018 world tour, the El Dorado World Tour.

On March 22, 2019, The municipalities of Bsharri, Lebanon, and Val d’Isère, France inked an agreement to promote cultural exchange between the two towns. The cultural exchange program aims to build bridges for French and Lebanese youth that want to experience the unique cultural relationship and similarities the two countries possess. The mayor of Val d’Isère, Marc Bauer, led a French delegation to Lebanon to inaugurate a program aimed at promoting cultural and athletic exchange between the two famous ski locations.

Andrea Bocelli performed at the opening ceremony of The Cedars International Festival-Bsharri (CIF) before an audience of 8,000 people. Before the festival, Bocelli visited the Cedars of God, where he was received by the head of the Lebanese Forces Party, Samir Geagea.

Bsharri natives are also known for their strong Christian faith. Throughout the year, many religious festivities and commemorations take place in the town, attracting thousands from neighbouring villages.

== Cedars ski resort ==
The Cedars resort is located in the North of Lebanon. Skiers came to the resort as early as 1920, and have been returning there ever since. The first lift was installed by the government in 1953.

The Cedars resort has a slightly longer season than the others, sometimes beginning early November and often lasting until late April. Pisted and off-piste skiing is possible, as well as Nordic skiing and skidoo rides. In summer 2005, The Cedars resort installed three new chairlifts to replace the old T-bars and extend the ski runs. Fifteen million US Dollars have lately been invested to upgrade the facilities and raise the standard of the resort&#x27;s accommodation, equipment, safety and services.

An ongoing project envisages a gondola that would carry skiers and visitors from the parking level at to the highest accessible summit of . There is no indication yet of when and whether this will be finalized. To comply with international regulations, a refuge with a capacity of 400 persons also needs be built at the top of the gondola, and equipped with telescopes allowing vistas as far away as the island of Cyprus.

<text>Caudium is an open source web server. It was originally created as a fork of the Roxen Challenger server. The server is written in C and Pike, and Pike is also used to create extensions to the server.

Caudium is very different from the Apache. The configuration process is different, the directory structure is different, and generally the languages used to program server extensions or dynamic pages are different, although both support PHP. According to the Caudium website, Caudium offers a different performance profile than Apache, because it doesn&#x27;t fork external processes, making it better suited to cope with sudden spikes of traffic.

<doc id="587238" wikidata="Q153426" url="?curid=587238" title="Eltz Castle">
<text>Eltz Castle () is a medieval castle nestled in the hills above the Moselle between Koblenz and Trier, Germany. It is still owned by a branch of House of Eltz who have lived there since the 12th century. Eltz Castle along with Bürresheim Castle and Lissingen Castle are the only castles in the Eifel region which have never been destroyed.

The castle stands on a rock spur that is bounded on three sides by the river Elzbach, a tributary on the north side of the Moselle. The surrounding Eltz Forest has been declared a nature reserve by Flora-Fauna-Habitat and Natura 2000.

== Division ==

The castle is a so-called &quot;Ganerbenburg&quot;, or castle belonging to a community of joint heirs. This is a castle divided into several parts, which belong to different families or different branches of a family; this usually occurs when multiple owners of one or more territories jointly build a castle to house themselves. Only wealthy medieval European lords could afford to build castles or equivalent structures on their lands; many of them only owned one village or even only part of a village. This was an insufficient base to afford castles. Such lords usually lived in &quot;knight&#x27;s houses&quot;, which were fairly simple houses, scarcely bigger than those of their tenants. In some parts of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, inheritance law required that the estate be divided among all successors. These successors, each of whose individual inheritance was too small to build a castle of his own, could build a castle together, where each owned one separate part for housing, and all of them together shared the defensive fortification. In the case of Eltz, the family comprised three branches and the existing castle was enhanced with three separate complexes of buildings.

The main part of the castle consists of the family portions. At up to eight stories, these eight towers reach heights of between . They are fortified with strong exterior walls; to the yard, they present a partial framework. About 100 members of the owners&#x27; families lived in the over 100 rooms of the castle. A village once existed below the castle, on its south side, which housed servants, craftsmen, and their families supporting the castle.

== History ==

The castle was founded in a region that was an important trade route between rich farmlands and their markets in the Roman period. With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the late 5th Century AD, the area was conquered by the Franks. However with the division of Charlemagne&#x27;s empire the land was given to his son Louis the Pious (814). It was during this period that the site was occupied by a simple manor hall with an earthen palisade. 

Several hundred years later, House of Eltz began work on the Platteltz, a Romanesque keep, which was built on the site of the old manor hall. This remains the oldest part of the castle. By 1157 the fortress was an important part of the Holy Roman Empire under Frederick Barbarossa. It continued to protect the trade routes from the Moselle Valley and the Eifel region. 

Between 1331–1336, the castle endured the only serious military conflicts in its history during the Eltz Feud when lords in the region including Johann of Eltz, together with free imperial knights, opposed the territorial policies of Balduin von Trier who was the Elector and Prince-Archbishop of Trier. As a result of the standoff, Balduin lay siege to Johann at Eltz Castle. It was bombarded by primitive cannons known as Pot-de-fer and catapults from a small siege castle, Trutzeltz Castle, which was built on a rocky outcrop on the hillside above the castle (the remains can still be seen today as a few ruined walls on the northern side of the castle). The siege of Eltz ended after two years when the free imperial knights agreed to accept the laws and sovereignty of Trier. Archbishop Balduin reinstated Johann to the Burgrave, but only as his vassal and no longer as a free knight. 

Started in 1470 by Philipp zu Eltz, the 10-story Greater Rodendorf House takes its name from the family&#x27;s land holding in Lorraine. The oldest part is the flag hall with its late Gothic vaulted ceiling, which was probably originally a chapel. Construction was completed around 1520. The (so-called) Little Rodendorf house was finished in 1540, also in Late Gothic style. It contains the vaulted &quot;banner-room&quot;. In 1472 the House of Rübenach completed the castle wing that has Late Gothic architecture. The buildings include the Rübenach Lower Hall, living room, and the bedchamber with its opulently decorated walls.

In 1615 the House of Kempenich house replaced castle&#x27;s original hall. Every room in this part of the castle could be heated; in contrast, other castles might only have one or two heated rooms.

During the Palatinate War of Succession from 1688 to 1689, many of the early Rhenish castles were destroyed. However, the castle was saved from destruction because its lord as the time was Hans Anton zu Eltz-Üttingen who was also a senior officer in the Royal French Army of Louis XIV. Eltz-Üttingen was able to use his position to delete the castle bearing his name from the list of buildings and fortifications to be destroyed.

Count Hugo Philipp zu Eltz was thought to have fled during the French rule on the Rhine from 1794 to 1815. The French confiscated his possessions on the Rhine and nearby Trier which included Eltz castle, as well as the associated goods which were held at the French headquarters in Koblenz. In 1797, when Count Hugo Philipp later turned out to have remained hidden in Mainz, he came back to reclaim his lands, goods and wealth. In 1815 he became the sole owner of the castle through the purchase of the Rübenacher house and the landed property of the barons of Eltz-Rübenach.

==Preservation==

In the mid 19th century, Count Karl zu Eltz restored the castle. Between 1845 and 1888, 184,000 marks () was spent on extensive construction work that carefully preserved the existing architecture.

Extensive security and restoration work took place between the years 2009 to 2012. Among other things, the vault of flags hall was secured after it was at risk of partially collapsing walls and the porch of the Kempenich section. In addition to these static repairs, almost all the slate roofs were replaced. Structural problems were remedied in the ceiling and wood damage was repaired. In the interior, heating and sanitary facilities, windows and fire alarm system were renewed, and also historic plaster was restored. The half-timbered facades and a spiral staircase were renovated at the costs of around €4.4 million. The measures were supported by a €2 million grant from an economic stimulus package provided by the German federal government. The state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the German Foundation for Monument Protection and the owners provided further funds. 

The Rübenach and Rodendorf family wings in the castle are open to the public, while the Kempenich branch continue to use their third of the castle. Public visits are seasonal: from April to November. Exhibits include the treasury, which contains gold, silver and porcelain artifacts, and the armory which hosts historic weapons and suits of armor.

==In popular culture==
From 1965 to 1992, an engraving of Eltz Castle was used on the German 500 Deutsche Mark note. 

The castle was used as the exterior for the fictional American military lunatic asylum in the 1979 William Peter Blatty movie, &quot;The Ninth Configuration&quot;, starring Stacy Keach. 

The opening sequences of &quot;Le Feu de Wotan&quot;, a Belgian bande dessinée (comic book) in the Yoko Tsuno series, take place in Eltz Castle. Eltz castle also inspired the castle featured chiefly on the Himmelsdorf map and its winter derivative of the MMO &quot;World of Tanks&quot;. The model of the castle is also reused on the maps Westfield and Erlenberg. 

Eltz Castle decorates the homepage of the German Whitepages as a symbol of German culture next to BMW, Nivea Cream, a Thurn and Taxis postcoach or the facade of Deutsches Museum.

The Eltz Castle (ingame name Elzbach Palace) is the Defensive Imperial Age Landmark of the Holy Roman Empire Civilization in &quot;Age of Empires IV&quot;.

<text>The brown wood owl (Strix leptogrammica) is found in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Taiwan, and south China. The brown wood owl is a resident breeder in south Asia. This species is a part of the family of owls known as typical owls (Strigidae), which contains most species of owl. It belongs to the earless owl genus &quot;Strix&quot;.

The brown wood owl is medium large (45–57 cm), with upperparts uniformly dark brown, with faint white spotting on the shoulders. The underparts are buff with brown streaking. The facial disc is brown or rufous, edged with white and without concentric barring, and the eyes are dark brown. There is a white neckband. The sexes are similar in appearance.
Their call is a &quot;(hoo) hoo hoo HOO&quot;, or a deep &quot;goke-goke-ga-LOOO&quot;, or a loud scream. Their alarm call is a bark, &quot;wow-wow&quot;. Some subspecies are known to produce distinct vocalizations; they are also different in appearance and parapatric, and might be distinct species: The northern &quot;Strix (leptogrammica) newarensis&quot; group (Himalayan wood-owl; present subspecies &quot;newarensis&quot;, &quot;ticehursti&quot;, &quot;laotiana&quot; and &quot;caligata&quot;) which occur from the Himalayan foothills of Kashmir east to Taiwan have a soft low &quot;to-hooh&quot; not unlike a rock dove cooing. &quot;S. (l.) bartelsi&quot; (Bartels&#x27;s wood-owl), Javan wood-owl from Java, the southeasternmost taxon, has a loud, forceful, single &quot;HOOH!&quot; with long pauses between calls.

This species is highly nocturnal and is commonly found in dense forests. It can often be located by the small birds that mob it while it is roosting in a tree. The diet of the brown wood owl consists mainly of small mammals, birds, and reptiles.

== Subspecies ==
There are 14 subspecies.

* &quot;S. leptogrammica bartelsi&quot; - Bartel&#x27;s wood-owl or Javan brown wood owl

<text>Fathi Eljahmi () (4 April 1941 – 21 May 2009) was Libya&#x27;s &quot;most prominent democratic dissident&quot; for three decades up until his death, and received significant international attention.

He was arrested in October 2002 and sentenced to five years in prison for stating at a &#x27;People&#x27;s Conference&#x27; in Tripoli that reform in Libya would require a constitution, free speech and democracy. He was briefly released in March 2004 after U.S. Senator Joe Biden met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and then re-imprisoned after calling for democratization of Libya in a television interview. In early 2004 he, his wife, and his eldest son were taken into custody.

The Libyan government claimed that Eljahmi was put on trial in late 2005, accused of the capital charges of &quot;trying to overthrow the government, insulting Col. Gaddafi and contacting foreign authorities, after he talked to a US diplomat.&quot; Physicians for Human Rights reported at the time that he was receiving inadequate care for heart disease and diabetes. During her visit to Libya, the United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice pleaded for Eljahmi&#x27;s release from solitary detention. Eljahmi remained imprisoned. Writing in &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2009, Fathi&#x27;s brother Mohamed criticised the lack of support that Eljahmi had received from human rights organisations, stating that &quot;for nearly a year, both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch hesitated to advocate publicly for Fathi&#x27;s case, because they feared their case workers might lose access to Libyan visas.&quot;

Eljahmi died on 21 May 2009 in Amman, Jordan, where he had been evacuated for emergency medical treatment after falling into a coma in Libyan custody.

<doc id="587247" wikidata="Q1135397" url="?curid=587247" title="Classical planet">
<text>A classical planet is an astronomical object that is visible to the naked eye and moves across the sky and its backdrop of fixed stars (the common stars which seem still in contrast to the planets). Visible to humans on Earth there are seven classical planets (the seven luminaries). They are from brightest to dimmest: the Sun, the Moon, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Saturn.

Greek astronomers such as Geminus and Ptolemy recorded these classical planets during classical antiquity, introducing the term &quot;planet&quot;, which means &#x27;wanderer&#x27; in Greek ( and ), expressing the fact that these objects move across the celestial sphere relative to the fixed stars. Therefore, the Greeks were the first to document the astrological connections to the planets&#x27; visual detail.

Through the use of telescopes other celestial objects like the classical planets were found, starting with the Galilean moons in 1610. Today the term &quot;planet&quot; is used considerably differently, with a planet being defined as a natural satellite directly orbiting the Sun (or other stars) and having cleared its own orbit. Therefore, only five of the seven classical planets remain recognized as planets, alongside Earth, Uranus, and Neptune.

==History==
===Babylonian===
The Babylonians recognized seven planets. A bilingual list in the British Museum records the seven Babylonian planets in the following order:

*The Moon, Sin.
*The Sun, Shamash.
*Jupiter, Merodach.
*Venus, Ishtar.
*Saturn, Ninip.
*Mercury, Nebo.
*Mars, Nergal.

===Mandaean===
In Mandaeism, the names of the seven planets are derived from the seven Babylonian planets. Overall, the seven classical planets (; , &quot;planets&quot;; or, combined, &quot;Seven Planets&quot;) are generally not viewed favorably in Mandaeism, since they constitute part of the entourage of Ruha, the Queen of the World of Darkness who is also their mother. However, individually, some of the planets can be associated with positive qualities. The names of the seven planets in Mandaic are borrowed from Akkadian. Some of the names are ultimately derived from Sumerian, since Akkadian had borrowed many deity names from Sumerian.

Each planet is said to be carried in a ship. Drawings of these ships are found in various Mandaean scriptures, such as the &quot;Scroll of Abatur&quot;. The planets are listed according to the traditional Mandaean order of the planets as mentioned in Masco (2012).

==Symbols==
The astrological symbols for the classical planets appear in the medieval Byzantine codices in which many ancient horoscopes were preserved. In the original papyri of these Greek horoscopes, there are found a circle with one ray () for the Sun and a crescent for the Moon.
The written symbols for Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn have been traced to forms found in late Greek papyri. The symbols for Jupiter and Saturn are identified as monograms of the initial letters of the corresponding Greek names, and the symbol for Mercury is a stylized caduceus.

A. S. D. Maunder finds antecedents of the planetary symbols in earlier sources, used to represent the gods associated with the classical planets. &quot;Bianchini&#x27;s planisphere&quot;, produced in the 2nd century, shows Greek personifications of planetary gods charged with early versions of the planetary symbols: Mercury has a caduceus; Venus has, attached to her necklace, a cord connected to another necklace; Mars, a spear; Jupiter, a staff; Saturn, a scythe; the Sun, a circlet with rays radiating from it; and the Moon, a headdress with a crescent attached.
A diagram in Johannes Kamateros&#x27; 12th century &quot;Compendium of Astrology&quot; shows the Sun represented by the circle with a ray, Jupiter by the letter &quot;zeta&quot; (the initial of Zeus, Jupiter&#x27;s counterpart in Greek mythology), Mars by a shield crossed by a spear, and the remaining classical planets by symbols resembling the modern ones, without the cross-mark seen in modern versions of the symbols. The modern Sun symbol, pictured as a circle with a dot (☉), first appeared in the Renaissance.

==Planetary hours==

The Ptolemaic system used in ancient Greek astronomy placed the planets by order of proximity to Earth in the then-current geocentric model, closest to furthest, as the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. In addition the day was divided into seven-hour intervals, each ruled by one of the planets, although the order was staggered (see below).

The first hour of each day was named after the ruling planet, giving rise to the names and order of the Roman seven-day week. Modern Latin-based cultures, in general, directly inherited the days of the week from the Romans and they were named after the classical planets; for example, in Spanish &quot;Miércoles&quot; is Mercury, and in French &quot;mardi&quot; is Mars-day.

The modern English days of the week were mostly inherited from gods of the old Germanic Norse culture – Wednesday is &quot;Wōden&quot;’s-day (&quot;Wōden&quot; or &quot;Wettin&quot; eqv. Mercury), Thursday is &quot;Thor&quot;’s-day (Thor eqv. Jupiter), Friday is &quot;Frige&quot;-day (Frige eqv. Venus). Equivalence here is by the gods&#x27; roles; for instance, Venus and Frige were both goddesses of love. It can be correlated that the Norse gods were attributed to each Roman planet and its god, probably due to Roman influence rather than coincidentally by the naming of the planets. A vestige of the Roman convention remains in the English name Saturday.

==Alchemy==
In alchemy, each classical planet (Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) was associated with one of the seven metals known to the classical world (silver, mercury/quicksilver, copper, gold, iron, tin and lead respectively). As a result, the alchemical glyphs for the metal and associated planet coincide. Alchemists believed the other elemental metals were variants of these seven (e.g. zinc was known as &quot;Indian tin&quot; or &quot;mock silver&quot;).

Alchemy in the Western World and other locations where it was widely practiced was (and in many cases still is) allied and intertwined with traditional Babylonian-Greek style astrology; in numerous ways they were built to complement each other in the search for hidden knowledge (knowledge that is not common i.e. the occult). Astrology has used the concept of classical elements from antiquity up until the present day today. Most modern astrologers use the four classical elements extensively, and indeed they are still viewed as a critical part of interpreting the astrological chart.
Traditionally, each of the seven planets in the Solar System as known to the ancients was associated with, held dominion over, and &quot;ruled&quot; a certain metal.

The list of rulership is as follows:
* The Sun rules Gold ()
* The Moon, Silver ()
* Mercury, Quicksilver/Mercury ()
* Venus, Copper ()
* Mars, Iron ()
* Jupiter, Tin ()
* Saturn, Lead ()

Some alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the vital organs and the planets as follows:
==Contemporary astrology==

===Western astrology===

===Indian astrology===
Indian astronomy and astrology (&quot;jyotiṣa&quot;) recognises seven visible planets (including the Sun and Moon) and two additional invisible planets(&quot;tamo&#x27;graha&quot;); rahu and ketu.

==Naked-eye planets==

Mercury and Venus are visible only in twilight hours because their orbits are interior to that of Earth. Venus is the third-brightest object in the sky and the most prominent planet. Mercury is more difficult to see due to its proximity to the Sun. Lengthy twilight and an extremely low angle at maximum elongations make optical filters necessary to see Mercury from extreme polar locations. Mars is at its brightest when it is in opposition, which occurs approximately every twenty-five months. Jupiter and Saturn are the largest of the five planets, but are farther from the Sun, and therefore receive less sunlight. Nonetheless, Jupiter is often the next brightest object in the sky after Venus. Saturn&#x27;s luminosity is often enhanced by its rings, which reflect light to varying degrees, depending on their inclination to the ecliptic; however, the rings themselves are not visible to the naked eye from the Earth.

<doc id="587265" wikidata="Q565130" url="?curid=587265" title="Audition (1999 film)">
<text>is a 1999 Japanese horror film directed by Takashi Miike and written by Daisuke Tengan. An adaptation of Ryu Murakami&#x27;s 1997 novel, it stars Ryo Ishibashi and Eihi Shiina. The film follows a middle-aged widower who enlists the help of his film producer friend to stage a fake audition in order to meet a new girlfriend, only to find that the dark past of the woman he chooses severely affects their relationship.

The film was originally a project of the Japanese company Omega Project, who wanted to make another horror film after the financial success of &quot;Ring&quot; (1998). The company purchased the rights to Murakami&#x27;s book and sought Miike and Tengan for an adaptation. The cast and crew consisted primarily of previous Miike collaborators, with the exception of Shiina, who had worked as a model prior to her acting career. The film was shot throughout Tokyo in approximately three weeks.

&quot;Audition&quot; premiered with a few other Japanese horror films at the Vancouver International Film Festival, but received increased attention when screened at the 2000 Rotterdam International Film Festival, where it received the FIPRESCI Prize and the KNF Award. Following a theatrical release in Japan, the film continued to play at festivals and had theatrical releases in the United States and United Kingdom, followed by several home media releases.

The film was received positively by Western film critics, with many singling out the final torture scene and its stark contrast with the non-horrific scenes that preceded it. The film has appeared on several lists of the best horror films ever made, and has had an influence on other horror directors including Eli Roth and the Soska sisters.

== Plot ==
Shigeharu Aoyama visits his wife Ryoko in hospital, where she dies from an undisclosed illness. Seven years later, Shigeharu&#x27;s teenage son Shigehiko encourages him to find a new wife. Shigeharu&#x27;s friend, film producer Yasuhisa Yoshikawa, devises a fake casting audition at which young women audition for the starring role in a new television series, though they are actually auditioning for the part of Shigeharu&#x27;s new wife. Posing as a casting director, Shigeharu is immediately enchanted by an applicant named Asami Yamazaki, who says she was pursuing a career as a ballet dancer until injuries ended her aspirations.

Yasuhisa is suspicious when he cannot reach any of the references in Asami&#x27;s résumé, such as a music producer she said she worked for, who turns out to have gone missing eighteen months earlier. Shigeharu is so enthralled that he pursues her anyway. She lives in a tiny apartment, containing little more than a large sack and a telephone; she sits perfectly still next to the phone for four days after the audition, waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers and pretends that she never expected Shigeharu to call. After several dates, she accompanies him to a hotel, where Shigeharu intends to propose marriage. She reveals burn scars on her body and, before having sex, demands that Shigeharu pledge his love to her. Deeply moved, he agrees. In the morning, Shigeharu receives a call from the front desk to inform him that Asami has left.

Shigeharu tries to track Asami down, but all of the contacts on her résumé are dead ends, as Yasuhisa warned. At the dance studio where she said she trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet who tortured her by burning her legs when she was a child. The bar where she said she worked has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner, and a local man tells Shigeharu that the police found an extra tongue, an extra ear, and three extra fingers when they recovered the body. Shigeharu has hallucinations of the body pieces.

Asami sneaks into Shigeharu&#x27;s house while he is at work and becomes jealous when she sees a framed picture of Ryoko. She drugs his liquor and kills Gangu, the family dog. Shigeharu comes home, drinks the spiked liquor, and collapses. He has a series of hallucinations, including flashbacks to earlier dates with Asami and sexual experiences with other women who came to the audition. In Asami&#x27;s apartment, he sees that the sack contains a man who is missing both feet, his tongue, an ear, and three fingers on one hand. He crawls out and begs for food, prompting Asami to vomit into a dog bowl, which he hungrily consumes as Shigeharu watches in horror. He then sees her behead the man with prosthetic feet.

When Shigeharu wakes up, Asami informs him he&#x27;s been injected with a paralytic agent that disables his muscles but leaves him conscious and able to feel, and begins to torture him with acupuncture needles. She tells him that, just like everyone else, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his abdomen and below his eyes. She then cuts off his left foot with a wire saw. As she is halfway through cutting off his right foot, Shigehiko returns home from school and Asami attacks him. Shigeharu appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel, his current ordeal apparently just a nightmare, though this is actually a false awakening. He proposes marriage to Asami, who accepts. As he falls back asleep, he returns to reality to find Shigehiko fighting Asami. Shigehiko overpowers Asami and kicks her down the stairs, breaking her neck. Shigeharu tells Shigehiko to call the police and stares across the room at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement over seeing him again.

== Themes ==
Critics have considered &quot;Audition&quot; as both feminist and misogynistic. Miike has stated that when he met journalists in the United Kingdom and France, he found they commented on the film&#x27;s feminist themes when Asami gets revenge on the men in her life. The film sets up Aoyama with traits and behaviors which could be considered sexist: a list of criteria for his bride to meet, and the phony audition format he uses to search for a future wife. Tom Mes, author of &quot;Agitator: The Cinema of Takashi Miike,&quot; stated that the torture sequence, with the mutilation of Aoyama, can be seen as revenge from Asami. Dennis Lim of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; examined similar themes, noting that the film is &quot;ultimately about the male fear of women and female sexuality&quot; and that women are blatantly objectified in the first half of the film, only to have Asami &quot;redress this imbalance&quot; in the second half when she becomes an &quot;avenging angel&quot;.

Chris Pizzello, writing in the &quot;American Cinematographer&quot;, stated that one plausible approach to interpreting the film is to see the final act as a representation of Aoyama&#x27;s guilt at his mistreatment of women and his desire to dominate them.
 Aoyama develops a paranoid fantasy of an attacking object: because he harbours sadistic thoughts towards women, he develops a fear that the object will retaliate. Contrary to this, Miike has stated that the final torture scenes in the film are not a paranoid nightmare dreamed up by Aoyama.
 Tom Mes has argued against the feminist portrayal of the film, noting that Asami is not motivated by an ideological agenda, and that acknowledging that she takes revenge on a man who has lied to her would be ignoring that she has also lied to Aoyama. Asami states &quot;I want to tell you everything&quot; during the torture scene, implying she had not been truthful before. Mes also notes that the avenging angel theme contradicts a feminist-themed revenge interpretation, given that one of Asami&#x27;s victims is female.

In &quot;Audition&quot;, the character of Asami is a victim of child abuse. Colette Balmain, in her book &quot;Introduction to Japanese Horror Film&quot;, described Asami as &quot;just one more face of the wronged women in Japanese culture... They are victims of repression and oppression, and only death and loneliness remain for them&quot;. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that through her child abuse, Asami is taught that love and pain must be inseparable. The audience is led to identify with Asami through this victimization and also what Stephen LeDrew described as a &quot;patriarchal Japanese society&quot;.

Elvis Mitchell (&quot;The New York Times&quot;) stated that the theme of the film was: &quot;the objectification of women in Japanese society and the mirror-image horror of retribution it could create&quot;. Tom Mes suggested that these themes can be witnessed in the scene where Asami feeds her mutilated prisoner and then turns into the childhood version of herself and pets him like a dog. Mes concludes that this is done to suggest that what had happened in Asami&#x27;s life had made her the violent adult seen in the film.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

The main production company behind &quot;Audition&quot; was the Japanese company Omega Project.
 Omega were originally behind the production of Hideo Nakata&#x27;s film &quot;Ring&quot;; this was a great success in Japan and, subsequently, the rest of Asia. Omega had problems setting up the release of &quot;Ring&quot; in Korea and had the company AFDF Korea work on a Korean re-adaptation of &quot;Ring&quot;. The following year, in 1998, Omega partnered again with AFDF Korea and other production companies including Creators Company Connection, Film Face, and Bodysonic to make the adaptation of Ryū Murakami&#x27;s 1997 novel &quot;Audition&quot;. Omega wanted to create a film different from the supernatural-themed &quot;Ring&quot;, and chose to adapt Murakami&#x27;s novel, which lacked this trait. To attempt something different, they hired a screenwriter (Daisuke Tengan) and a director (Takashi Miike) who were not known for working on horror films. Prior to &quot;Audition&quot;, Tengan was best known as a screenwriter for working with his father (Shohei Imamura) on &quot;The Eel&quot;, which won the Palme d&#x27;Or in 1997.

=== Pre-production ===
To create &quot;Audition&quot;, Miike worked with many of his previous collaborators, such as cinematographer Hideo Yamamoto.
 Miike spoke of his cinematographer by saying that Yamamoto was: &quot;very sensitive towards death. Both of his parents died very young, and it&#x27;s not something he talks about much&quot;. Miike also noted that he felt that Yamamoto was: &quot;living in fear, and that sensibility comes through in his work. It&#x27;s something I want to make the most of&quot;.
 The film&#x27;s score was composed by Kōji Endō. Endō had previously composed work for Miike on films such as &quot;The Bird People in China&quot;. Yasushi Shimamura was the film&#x27;s editor. Shimamura had worked with Miike as early as &quot;Lady Hunter: Prelude To Murder&quot; in 1991.

Actor Ryo Ishibashi wanted to work with Miike and agreed to the role. He commented that despite not being a great fan of horror films, he enjoyed scripts such as that of &quot;Audition&quot;, that showcased human nature. Model Eihi Shiina was cast in the film as Asami. Shiina&#x27;s career was primarily as a model and she only began acting after being offered a film role while she was on holidays.

Shiina first learned about Miike through his film &quot;Blues Harp&quot;, which made her interested in meeting the director. When Shiina first met Miike, they began talking about her opinions on love and relationships. On their second meeting, Miike asked Shiina to play the part of Asami. Shiina thought that the opinions and feelings she expressed to Miike were the reason she was cast in the role, and she tried to play the role as naturally as she could without going over the top.

=== Production ===
&quot;Audition&quot; was shot in approximately three weeks, which was about one more week than usual for Miike&#x27;s films at the time. Scenes such as those in Asami&#x27;s apartment and at a restaurant were shot on location in a real apartment and a real restaurant.
Outdoor scenes were shot in Tokyo, along intersections in Omotesandō.

The torture scene at the end of the film did not initially contain Asami&#x27;s lines &quot;Kiri-kiri-kiri&quot;. Shiina was initially whispering her lines while filming this scene, but after discussion with Miike, the two decided that having her say these lines would make the scene scarier. Ishibashi found that Miike was &quot;having so much fun with that scene&quot;, and that Miike was especially excited when Ishibashi&#x27;s character&#x27;s feet are cut off. For the special effects where Shiina&#x27;s character places acupuncture needles into Ishibashi, special effects make-up was used to create a mask layer which was laid upon Ishibashi&#x27;s eyes, which is then pierced by the needles.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===

&quot;Audition&quot; had its world premiere on October 2, 1999, at the Vancouver International Film Festival. The premiere was part of a program of modern Japanese horror films at the festival, including &quot;Ring&quot;, &quot;Ring 2&quot;, &quot;Shikoku&quot; and &quot;Gemini&quot;.
 &quot;Audition&quot; was screened at the 29th Rotterdam International Film Festival in The Netherlands in early 2000 where it was shown as part of a Miike retrospective. Tom Mes stated that &quot;Audition&quot; received the most attention at Rotterdam, where it won the FIPRESCI Prize for the best film of competition. The FIPRESCI award was given by a jury of international film journalists, who grant this award during the Rotterdam International Film Festival. Only films not in competition qualify for the award. &quot;Audition&quot; also won the KNF Award, voted by the Circle of Dutch Film journalists.

&quot;Audition&quot; was released theatrically in Japan on March 3, 2000. When asked about the reception in Japan, Miike stated that there was &quot;no reaction&quot; as the film was shown in small theaters for a short theatrical run.

Miike followed up that the Japanese audience did not really know about &quot;Audition&quot; until it received a greater reputation abroad. It received its American premiere at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2000. The film was given its theatrical release in the United States on August 8, 2001. It eventually grossed $131,296 in the country.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Audition&quot; received screenings in 2000 at both FrightFest and the Raindance Film Festival. It was released theatrically in the United Kingdom by Metro Tartan in mid-March 2001. It was Miike&#x27;s first film to be released theatrically in the United Kingdom.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Audition&quot; was released on DVD in the United States by Chimera on June 4, 2002.
The DVD included an interview with Miike and a documentary on the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles. A new DVD was released by Lionsgate in 2005 dubbed the &quot;uncut special edition&quot;. This release included an interview with Ryu Murakami, a selected scene commentary by Miike, and a clip from Bravo&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;. Peter Schorn of IGN gave a negative review of the 2006 DVD, finding that the video was &quot;overcompressed to the point that a distracting, shifting blockiness frequently in backgrounds that draws the eye away from the actors&quot;. IGN concluded that the: &quot;overall image quality is soft and fuzzy, with weak black levels, murky shadow areas and less-than-impressive color saturation&quot;. On October 6, 2009, Shout! Factory released a DVD and Blu-ray release of the film that featured an introduction by Miike and actress Eihi Shiina, a full audio commentary by Miike and screenwriter Daisuke Tengan, and a documentary featuring the cast.

&quot;Audition&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on DVD by Tartan Video on June 28, 2004. The disc contained an interview with Miike and liner notes by Joe Cornish. Matthew Leyland (&quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;) reviewed this release, stating that the audio and visual presentation was &quot;exemplary&quot; while noting that the interview with Miike was the only noteworthy bonus feature on the disc. The film was later released by Arrow Video on February 29, 2016. The Arrow Video release was exclusively restored in 2K resolution and was scanned from a 35 mm interpositive.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 83% based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;An audacious, unsettling Japanese horror film from director Takashi Miike, &quot;Audition&quot; entertains as both a grisly shocker and a psychological drama&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Ken Eisner (&quot;Variety&quot;) gave the film a positive review. Eisner referred to the film as a &quot;truly shocking horror film&quot; that was &quot;made even more disturbing by its haunting beauty&quot;. Geoffrey Macnab, writing in &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, referred to the film as a &quot;slow-burning but ultimately devastating horror pic&quot; and wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s a virtuoso piece of film-making with much more subtlety and depth than Miike&#x27;s other films&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; Frank Scheck described the film as &quot;one of the most audacious, iconoclastic horror films in recent years&quot;. Mark Schilling (&quot;The Japan Times&quot;) praised Shiina and Ishibashi&#x27;s acting, but noted that &quot;among the film&#x27;s few irritants is a smarmy, snarly bad guy turn by Renji Ishibashi as Asami&#x27;s wheelchair-using ballet instructor. He is a reminder of where too many other Miike films have headed – straight for the video racks&quot;. Schilling concluded that &quot;Miike is ready for a bigger role – as one of the leading Japanese directors of his generation&quot;. In the early 2010s, &quot;Time Out&quot; conducted a poll with several authors, directors, actors and critics who have worked within the horror genre to vote for their top horror films. &quot;Audition&quot; placed at number 18 on their top 100 list.

=== Final sequence response ===
Writers for &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; all emphasized the film&#x27;s final scene. Scheck (&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;) wrote that &quot;Miike lulls the audience into a state of complacency with a studied, slow-moving, lightly comic first half before delivering a gruesome final section that makes Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Misery&quot; look wholesome&quot;; the ending was &quot;all the more shocking for the clinical way in which it is presented&quot;. Eisner (&quot;Variety&quot;) stated that it is only at the ending of the film that &quot;Audition&quot; &quot;breaks out of creepfest ghetto&quot;. In his essay on themes in &quot;Audition&quot;, Robin Wood stated that most of Miike&#x27;s films are disturbing for &quot;what they have to tell us about the state of contemporary civilization; they are not in the least disturbing in themselves, operating on some fantasy level of annihilation, with &#x27;comic-book&#x27; violence&quot;. In comparison, he stated that &quot;Audition&quot; is &quot;authentically disturbing, and infinitely more horrifying: the first time I watched it – on DVD, at home, after warnings I had received – I was repeatedly tempted, through the last half hour, to turn it off&quot;. Wood compared the film to Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot;, stating that the film was &quot;almost as unwatchable as the news reels – of Auschwitz, of the innocent victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Vietnam, victims of Nazi or American dehumanization&quot;.

Of the film&#x27;s success with Western audiences, Miike states that he was not surprised, but that he had &quot;no idea what goes on in the minds of people in the West and I don&#x27;t pretend to know what their tastes are. And I don&#x27;t want to start thinking about that. It&#x27;s nice that they liked my movie, but I&#x27;m not going to start deliberately worrying about why or what I can do to make it happen again&quot;. Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch &quot;Audition&quot;. By comparison, she said, the film was seen by many more people overseas, which she attributed to &quot;good timing&quot;.

== Aftermath and influence ==

After the release of &quot;Audition&quot;, Miike was going to adapt Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;Coin Locker Babies&quot;, but the project failed to find enough financing.

&quot;Audition&quot; has been described as an influence on &quot;torture porn&quot;. The term was invented by David Edelstein to describe films such as &quot;Saw&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; and &quot;Wolf Creek&quot; offering &quot;titillating and shocking&quot; scenes which push the audience to the margins of depravity in order for them to &quot;feel something&quot;. &quot;Audition&quot; influenced American directors such as Eli Roth. Roth stated that &quot;Audition&quot; influenced him to make his film &quot;Hostel&quot;, with Miike even making a cameo as a satisfied customer of the kidnappers who let customers torture their victims. Richard Corliss, writing in &quot;Time&quot;, opined that &quot;Audition&quot; was different from torture porn films as: &quot;unlike &quot;Saw&quot; and its imitators in the genre of torture porn, &quot;Audition&quot; doesn&#x27;t go for gore-ific money shots. Miike&#x27;s films live inside their characters, taking the temperature of their longings, the ridiculous ambitions they chase so obsessively and their need to experience the extreme to prove they&#x27;re alive&quot;.

&quot;Audition&quot; has been referenced in western popular culture such as comics, music videos, and other media.
 It was listed by twin directors Jen and Sylvia Soska as one of their favourite horror films, and with the sisters saying that it was an influence on their film &quot;American Mary&quot;. The directors noted the character of Asami, stating that an audience generally sees: &quot;female characters in a horror film as the helpless victim. This film leads you in one direction, skillfully hinting at a darker storyline for the otherwise meek and slight Asami until the final 15 minutes where we are introduced to a merciless monster. A perfect personification of the irrational rage of a woman scorned&quot;. Director Quentin Tarantino included &quot;Audition&quot; in his list of top 20 films released since 1992 (the year he became a director), referring to it as a &quot;true masterpiece if there ever was one&quot;.

&quot;Audition&quot; was among the films included in the book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;.

&quot;Deadline&quot; reported that executive producer Mario Kassar had begun work on an English-language adaptation of &quot;Audition&quot; in 2014. Richard Gray was brought on to serve as the remake&#x27;s director and screenwriter. The film&#x27;s storyline would be taken from Ryu Murakami&#x27;s novel as opposed to an adaptation of Miike&#x27;s film, and the film would take place in North America. The new film would include scenes and locations in the novel that were not in Miike&#x27;s film. Kassar spoke about the remake in 2016, saying he was &quot;almost there. It&#x27;s taking me a long time because it is kind of hard to do this movie but I&#x27;m not going to do it unless I know I&#x27;m doing it right.&quot; In January 2025, it was reported Focus Features and Hyde Park Entertainment were working on an adaptation of the novel to be directed and written by Christian Tafdrup and co-written by Christian&#x27;s brother and collaborator Mads Tafdrup.

<doc id="587271" wikidata="Q27037480" url="?curid=587271" title="Torsion spring">
<text>A torsion spring is a spring that works by twisting its end along its axis; that is, a flexible elastic object that stores mechanical energy when it is twisted. When it is twisted, it exerts a torque in the opposite direction, proportional to the amount (angle) it is twisted. There are various types:
*A torsion bar is a straight bar of metal or rubber that is subjected to twisting (shear stress) about its axis by torque applied at its ends. 
*A more delicate form used in sensitive instruments, called a torsion fiber consists of a fiber of silk, glass, or quartz under tension, that is twisted about its axis. 
*A helical torsion spring, is a metal rod or wire in the shape of a helix (coil) that is subjected to twisting about the axis of the coil by sideways forces (bending moments) applied to its ends, twisting the coil tighter. 
*Clocks use a spiral wound torsion spring (a form of helical torsion spring where the coils are around each other instead of piled up) sometimes called a &quot;clock spring&quot; or colloquially called a mainspring. Those types of torsion springs are also used for attic stairs, clutches, typewriters and other devices that need near constant torque for large angles or even multiple revolutions.

==Torsion, bending==
Torsion bars and torsion fibers do work by torsion. However, the terminology can be confusing because in helical torsion spring (including clock spring), the forces acting on the wire are actually bending stresses, not torsional (shear) stresses. A helical torsion spring actually works by torsion when it is bent (not twisted).
We will use the word &quot;torsion&quot; in the following for a torsion spring according to the definition given above, whether the material it is made of actually works by torsion or by bending.

==Torsion coefficient==
As long as they are not twisted beyond their elastic limit, torsion springs obey an angular form of Hooke&#x27;s law:

:formula_1

where

* formula_2 is the torque exerted by the spring in newton-meters, and formula_3 is the angle of twist from its equilibrium position in radians

* formula_4 is a constant with units of newton-meters / radian, variously called the spring&#x27;s torsion coefficient, torsion elastic modulus, rate, or just spring constant, equal to the change in torque required to twist the spring through an angle of 1 radian. 

The torsion constant may be calculated from the geometry and various material properties. It is analogous to the spring constant of a linear spring. The negative sign indicates that the direction of the torque is opposite to the direction of twist.

The energy &quot;U&quot;, in joules, stored in a torsion spring is:

:formula_5

==Uses==
Some familiar examples of uses are the strong, helical torsion springs that operate clothespins and traditional spring-loaded-bar type mousetraps. Other uses are in the large, coiled torsion springs used to counterbalance the weight of garage doors, and a similar system is used to assist in opening the trunk (boot) cover on some sedans. Small, coiled torsion springs are often used to operate pop-up doors found on small consumer goods like digital cameras and compact disc players. Other more specific uses:

*A &quot;torsion bar suspension&quot; is a thick, steel torsion-bar spring attached to the body of a vehicle at one end and to a lever arm which attaches to the axle of the wheel at the other. It absorbs road shocks as the wheel goes over bumps and rough road surfaces, cushioning the ride for the passengers. Torsion-bar suspensions are used in many modern cars and trucks, as well as military vehicles.
*The &quot;sway bar&quot; used in many vehicle suspension systems also uses the torsion spring principle.
*The &quot;torsion pendulum&quot; used in torsion pendulum clocks is a wheel-shaped weight suspended from its center by a wire torsion spring. The weight rotates about the axis of the spring, twisting it, instead of swinging like an ordinary pendulum. The force of the spring reverses the direction of rotation, so the wheel oscillates back and forth, driven at the top by the clock&#x27;s gears.
*Torsion springs consisting of twisted ropes or sinew, were used to store potential energy to power several types of ancient weapons; including the Greek ballista and the Roman scorpio and catapults like the onager.
*The &quot;balance spring&quot; or hairspring in mechanical watches is a fine, spiral-shaped torsion spring that pushes the balance wheel back toward its center position as it rotates back and forth. The balance wheel and spring function similarly to the torsion pendulum above in keeping time for the watch.
*The &quot;D&#x27;Arsonval movement&quot; used in mechanical pointer-type meters to measure electric current is a type of torsion balance (see below). A coil of wire attached to the pointer twists in a magnetic field against the resistance of a torsion spring. Hooke&#x27;s law ensures that the angle of the pointer is proportional to the current.
*A &quot;DMD&quot; or digital micromirror device chip is at the heart of many video projectors. It uses hundreds of thousands of tiny mirrors on tiny torsion springs fabricated on a silicon surface to reflect light onto the screen, forming the image.
*Badge tether

==Torsion balance==

The torsion balance, also called torsion pendulum, is a scientific apparatus for measuring very weak forces, usually credited to Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who invented it in 1777, but independently invented by John Michell sometime before 1783. Its most well-known uses were by Coulomb to measure the electrostatic force between charges to establish Coulomb&#x27;s Law, and by Henry Cavendish in 1798 in the Cavendish experiment to measure the gravitational force between two masses to calculate the density of the Earth, leading later to a value for the gravitational constant.

The torsion balance consists of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak torsion spring. If an unknown force is applied at right angles to the ends of the bar, the bar will rotate, twisting the fiber, until it reaches an equilibrium where the twisting force or torque of the fiber balances the applied force. Then the magnitude of the force is proportional to the angle of the bar. The sensitivity of the instrument comes from the weak spring constant of the fiber, so a very weak force causes a large rotation of the bar.

In Coulomb&#x27;s experiment, the torsion balance was an insulating rod with a metal-coated ball attached to one end, suspended by a silk thread. The ball was charged with a known charge of static electricity, and a second charged ball of the same polarity was brought near it. The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the instrument. By knowing how much force it took to twist the fiber through a given angle, Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls. Determining the force for different charges and different separations between the balls, he showed that it followed an inverse-square proportionality law, now known as Coulomb&#x27;s law.

To measure the unknown force, the spring constant of the torsion fiber must first be known. This is difficult to measure directly because of the smallness of the force. Cavendish accomplished this by a method widely used since: measuring the resonant vibration period of the balance. If the free balance is twisted and released, it will oscillate slowly clockwise and counterclockwise as a harmonic oscillator, at a frequency that depends on the moment of inertia of the beam and the elasticity of the fiber. Since the inertia of the beam can be found from its mass, the spring constant can be calculated.

Coulomb first developed the theory of torsion fibers and the torsion balance in his 1785 memoir, &quot;Recherches theoriques et experimentales sur la force de torsion et sur l&#x27;elasticite des fils de metal &amp;c&quot;. This led to its use in other scientific instruments, such as galvanometers, and the Nichols radiometer which measured the radiation pressure of light. In the early 1900s gravitational torsion balances were used in petroleum prospecting. Today torsion balances are still used in physics experiments. In 1987, gravity researcher A. H. Cook wrote:

The most important advance in experiments on gravitation and other delicate measurements was the introduction of the torsion balance by Michell and its use by Cavendish. It has been the basis of all the most significant experiments on gravitation ever since.In the Eötvös experiment, a torsion balance was used to prove the &quot;equivalence principle&quot; - the idea that inertial mass and gravitational mass are one and the same.

==Torsional harmonic oscillators==

Torsion balances, torsion pendulums and balance wheels are examples of torsional harmonic oscillators that can oscillate with a rotational motion about the axis of the torsion spring, clockwise and counterclockwise, in harmonic motion. Their behavior is analogous to translational spring-mass oscillators (see Harmonic oscillator Equivalent systems). The general differential equation of motion is:

:formula_6

If the damping is small, formula_7, as is the case with torsion pendulums and balance wheels, the frequency of vibration is very near the natural resonant frequency of the system:

:formula_8

Therefore, the period is represented by:

:formula_9

The general solution in the case of no drive force (formula_10), called the transient solution, is:

:formula_11

where:

::formula_12
::formula_13
===Applications===

The balance wheel of a mechanical watch is a harmonic oscillator whose resonant frequency formula_14 sets the rate of the watch. The resonant frequency is regulated, first coarsely by adjusting formula_15 with weight screws set radially into the rim of the wheel, and then more finely by adjusting formula_4 with a regulating lever that changes the length of the balance spring.

In a torsion balance the drive torque is constant and equal to the unknown force to be measured formula_17, times the moment arm of the balance beam formula_18, so formula_19. When the oscillatory motion of the balance dies out, the deflection will be proportional to the force:

:formula_20

To determine formula_17 it is necessary to find the torsion spring constant formula_4. If the damping is low, this can be obtained by measuring the natural resonant frequency of the balance, since the moment of inertia of the balance can usually be calculated from its geometry, so:

:formula_23

In measuring instruments, such as the D&#x27;Arsonval ammeter movement, it is often desired that the oscillatory motion die out quickly so the steady state result can be read off. This is accomplished by adding damping to the system, often by attaching a vane that rotates in a fluid such as air or water (this is why magnetic compasses are filled with fluid). The value of damping that causes the oscillatory motion to settle quickest is called the critical dampingformula_24:

:formula_25

<doc id="587273" wikidata="Q972330" url="?curid=587273" title="Japji Sahib">
<text>Japji Sahib 
(, pronunciation: ) is the Sikh thesis, that appears at the beginning of the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; – the scripture of the Sikhs. &quot;Jap&quot; is the original name of the prayer and to show respect, it is called &quot;Japji Sahib&quot;. It was composed by Guru Angad, and is mostly the writings of Guru Nanak. It begins with &quot;Mool Mantra&quot; and then follow 38 &quot;paudis&quot; (stanzas) and completed with a final &quot;Salok by Guru Angad&quot; at the end of this composition. The 38 stanzas are in different poetic meters.

&quot;Japji Sahib&quot; is the first composition of Guru Nanak, and is considered the comprehensive essence of Sikhism. Expansion and elaboration of &quot;Japji Sahib&quot; is the entire &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;. It is first Bani in Nitnem. Notable is Nanak&#x27;s discourse on &#x27;what is true worship&#x27; and what is the nature of God&#x27;. According to Christopher Shackle, it is designed for &quot;individual meditative recitation&quot; and as the first item of daily devotional prayer for the devout. It is a chant found in the morning and evening prayers in Sikh gurdwaras. It is also chanted in the Sikh tradition at the Khalsa initiation ceremony and during the cremation ceremony.

Related to &quot;Japji Sahib&quot; is the &quot;Jaap Sahib&quot; (), the latter is found at the start of Dasam Granth and was composed by Guru Gobind Singh.

==Etymology==
Japa (Sanskrit: जप) means the recitation of a mantra. The Sanskrit word &quot;japa&quot; is derived from the root &quot;jap-&quot;, meaning &quot;to utter in a low voice, repeat internally, mutter&quot;.

Following are some accepted meanings of Jap:
* A conventional meaning for Jap(u) is &quot;to recite&quot;, to repeat, or &quot;to chant&quot;. 
* Jap also means &quot;to understand&quot;. Gurbani cites &quot;Aisa Giaan Japo Man Mere, Hovo Chakar Sache Kere&quot;, where the word Jap means to understand wisdom.

==Content==
The Japji Sahib’s first stanza or pauri states that one cannot be cleaned or stay clean by repeatedly taking bath at holy sites as the thoughts are not clean, by silence alone one cannot find peace as the thoughts come one after another in our mind, by food and all material gains alone one cannot satisfy one&#x27;s hunger, to be purified one must abide in love of the divine. Hymn 2 asserts that by God&#x27;s command the ups and downs in life happen, it is He who causes suffering and happiness, it is He whose command brings release from rebirth, and it is His command by which one lives in perpetual cycles of rebirth from karma.

With good karmas in past life and his grace is the gate to &quot;mukti&quot; (liberation); in him is everything, states verse 4. The verse 5 states that He has endless virtues, so one must sing His name, listen, and keep the love for Him in one&#x27;s heart. The Guru&#x27;s &quot;shabda&quot; (word) is the protecting sound and wisdom of the Vedas, the Guru is Shiva, Vishnu (Gorakh) and Brahma, and the Guru is mother Parvati and Lakshmi. All living beings abide in Him. Verse 6 to 15 describe the value of listening to the word and having faith, for it is the faith that liberates. God is formless and indescribable, state verses 16 to 19. It is remembering His name that cleanses, liberates states Hymn 20. Hymns 21 through 27 revere the nature and name of God, stating that man&#x27;s life is like a river that does not know the vastness of ocean it journeys to join, that all literature from Vedas to Puranas speak of Him, Brahma speaks, Siddhas speak, Yogi speaks, Shiva speaks, the silent sages speak, the Buddha speaks, the Krishna speaks, the humble Sewadars speak, yet one cannot describe Him completely with all the words in the world.

Verse 30 states that He watches all, but none can see Him. God is the primal one, the pure light, without beginning, without end, the never changing constant, states Hymn 31.

==Japji Sahib and Jaap Sahib==

The Guru Granth Sahib starts with &quot;Japji Sahib&quot;, while Dasam Granth starts with Jaap Sahib. Guru Nanak is credited with the former, while Guru Gobind Singh Ji is credited with the latter. &quot;Jaap Sahib&quot; is structured as a stotra that are commonly found in 1st millennium CE Hindu literature. The Jaap Sahib, unlike the Japji Sahib, is composed predominantly in Braj-Hindi and the Sanskrit language, with a few Arabic and Persian words, and with 199 stanzas making it longer than Japji Sahib. The Jaap Sahib is, like Japji Sahib, in praise of God as the unchanging, loving, unborn, ultimate power and includes within it 950 names of God, starting with Brahma, Shiva, Vishnu and moving on to over 900 names and avatars of gods and goddesses found in Hindu traditions, with the assertion that these are all manifestations of the One, the limitless eternal creator. This is similar to Sahasranama texts of India, and for this reason this part is also called as Akal Sahasranama. The text includes Arabic and Persian words for God such as &quot;Allah&quot; and &quot;Khuda&quot;. The Japu Sahib includes a mention of God as wielder of weapons, consistent with the martial spirit of Dasam Granth.

<text>Mesotherapy (from Greek &quot;mesos&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and therapy from Greek &quot;therapeia&quot;) is a form of alternative medicine which involves intradermal or subcutaneous injections of pharmaceutical preparations, enzymes, hormones, plant extracts, vitamins, and/or other ingredients such as hyaluronic acid. It has no proven clinical efficacy and poor scientific backing. Mesotherapy injections allegedly target adipose fat cells, apparently by inducing lipolysis, rupture and cell death among adipocytes. The stated aim of mesotherapy is to provide the skin with essential nutrients, hydration, and other beneficial compounds to rejuvenate and revitalize its appearance. 

The effects of the treatment may vary depending on the individual.

Pressurized mesotherapy is a needle-free method that uses an accelerated jet of air to insert the ingredients into the skin tissue. A study on the effect of using a lipolytic substance inserted with needles compared to pressurized injection showed significant fat layer reduction for both methods but even better results with the pressurized injection system.

==Usage==
In the United States, deoxycholic acid, under the brand name Kybella, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reducing moderate-to-severe fat below the chin. When injected into submental fat, deoxycholic acid helps destroy adipocytes (fat cells), which are metabolized by the body over the course of several months. Deoxycholic acid has not been approved for injection elsewhere in the body.

There is no conclusive research proof that any chemical compounds work to target adipose (fat cells) specifically. Cell lysis, resulting from the detergent action of deoxycholic acid, may account for any clinical effect.

==History==
Michel Pistor (1924–2003) performed clinical research and founded the field of mesotherapy. 

The French press coined the term mesotherapy in 1958. The French Académie Nationale de Médecine recognized mesotherapy as a specialty of medicine in 1987. The French Society of Mesotherapy recognizes its use as treatment for various conditions but makes no mention of its use in plastic surgery. Popular throughout European countries and South America, mesotherapy is practiced by approximately 18,000 physicians worldwide.

==Criticism==
Physicians have expressed concern over the efficacy of mesotherapy, arguing that the treatment hasn&#x27;t been studied enough to make a determination. Mesotherapy for the treatment of cosmetic conditions hasn&#x27;t been the subject of standard clinical trials; however, the procedure has been studied for pain relief for several ailments, such as tendonitis, tendon calcification, dental procedures, cancer, cervicobrachialgia, arthritis, lymphedema, and venous stasis. 

Despite the lack of clinical trials, there have been case studies and medical papers written on mesotherapy as a cosmetic treatment.

Rod Rohrich, M.D., chairman of the Department of Plastic Surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center is quoted as saying: &quot;There is simply no data, no science and no information, to my knowledge, that mesotherapy works.&quot; The American Society of Plastic Surgeons issued a position statement not endorsing mesotherapy.

In the United States, the FDA cannot control the act of practitioners injecting various mixtures into patient&#x27;s bodies, because this practice falls under the jurisdiction of state medical boards. 

Robin Ashinoff, speaking for the American Academy of Dermatology, wrote &quot;A simple injection is giving people false hope. Everybody&#x27;s looking for a quick fix. But there is no quick fix for fat or fat deposits or for cellulite.&quot; The American Society for Dermatologic Surgery informed its members in February 2005 that &quot;further study is warranted before this technique can be endorsed.&quot;

&quot;No one says exactly what they put into the (syringe),&quot; said Naomi Lawrence, a derma-surgeon at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. &quot;One drug they often use, phosphatidylcholine, is unpredictable and causes extreme inflammation and swelling where injected. It is not a benign drug.&quot;

Mesotherapy is currently banned in a number of South American countries. Even Brazil, which tends to be less strict than the US in drug approvals, has banned the drug for these purposes.

In Australia, an alternative therapy salon was investigated by the Health Department after several clients developed skin abscesses on the calves, buttocks, thighs, abdomen, shoulders, face and neck after undergoing mesotherapy, with one patient also developing a mycobacterial infection.

Following undesirable effects observed on several patients of a French practitioner, an official ratification was published in France in April 2011 to ban mesotherapy as a method for removing fat deposits. This ban was canceled in June 2011 by the French Council of State because the investigation proved that these undesirable effects weren&#x27;t due to mesotherapy itself, but were due to unhygienic conditions.

==Clinical studies==
In a prospective study, 10 patients underwent four sessions of facial mesotherapy using multivitamins at monthly intervals. This study found that there was no clinically relevant benefit for skin rejuvenation. 

Deoxycholic acid received FDA approval as an injectable to dissolve submental fat June 2015. This was based on the results of a phase III randomized trial of 2600 patients in which 68.2% of patients showed a response by measurement of the fat deposit; 81% had mild temporary adverse reactions of bruising, swelling, pain, numbness, erythema, and firmness around the treated area.

<text>Stan Struthers (born 1959) is a Manitoba politician and a former member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the New Democratic Party (NDP). He served in the legislature from his election in 1995 until his retirement in 2016, holding various cabinet positions in the governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger during his time in office. In February 2018, he apologized after five former colleagues brought allegations of inappropriate touching over many years.

==Background==
Born in Swan River, Manitoba, Struthers graduated from Swan Valley Regional Secondary School in 1977, and later received his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Education degrees from Brandon University, and his Master&#x27;s of Education from the University of Manitoba. He went on to teach at Norway House, then became principal at Rorketon Collegiate and later taught at the Winnipegosis High School.

==Political career==
Struthers was first elected to the Manitoba Legislature in the 1995 provincial election as the member for Dauphin. He was re-elected as the MLA for the redistributed Dauphin—Roblin riding in 1999 and 2003. In his first term, he served as the NDP&#x27;s Natural Resources Critic and Deputy Agriculture Critic. After the NDP formed government, Struthers served as the legislative assistant to the Minister of Health, Dave Chomiak. Premier Gary Doer appointed Struthers as Minister of Conservation on November 4, 2003. On November 3, 2009, Premier Greg Selinger appointed Struthers as Minister of Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives.

In 1995, Struthers supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s campaign for the leadership of the federal New Democratic Party. In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie.

He was re-elected in the 2007 and 2011 elections.

Struthers resigned his cabinet position on November 3, 2014 along with Jennifer Howard, Theresa Oswald, Erin Selby, and Andrew Swan, due to concerns about Premier Selinger&#x27;s leadership. He remained an NDP MLA after resignation from cabinet. He did not seek re-election in Dauphin in the 2016 general election.

In February 2018, in association with the global Me Too movement, several women came forward with allegations that Stan Struthers sexually harassed and inappropriately touched several of his staff over many years while a member of the Legislative Assembly. During these years, Struthers&#x27; staff often referred to him as &quot;Minister Tickles&quot; behind his back. Party officials received at least three complaints about Struthers&#x27; tickling and harassment between 2010 and 2015 but no formal investigations took place. Struthers issued an apology for his behaviour in February 2018.

<doc id="587290" wikidata="Q828255" url="?curid=587290" title="Brown fish owl">
<text>The brown fish owl (Ketupa zeylonensis) is a fish owl species in the family known as typical owls, Strigidae. It is native from Turkey to South and Southeast Asia. Due its wide distribution it is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It inhabits forests and wooded wetlands. Of the four living species of fish owl, it is the most widely distributed, most common and best-studied. It occupies a range of over .

==Taxonomy==
The brown fish owl was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other owls in the genus &quot;Strix&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Strix zeylonensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Great Ceylonese horned owl&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the naturalist Peter Brown in his book &quot;New Illustrations of Zoology&quot;. Joan Gideon Loten, an administrator in the Dutch East India Company had provided Brown with a picture of the owl that had been drawn by the Ceylonese artist Pieter Cornelis de Bevere. The brown fish owl is now placed in the genus &quot;Ketupa&quot; that was introduced in 1830 by the French naturalist René Lesson.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;K. z. semenowi&quot; Zarudny, 1905 – southeast Turkey, Middle East to northwest India
* &quot;K. z. leschenaulti&quot; (Temminck, 1820) – India through Myanmar to west Thailand
* &quot;K. z. zeylonensis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – Sri Lanka
* &quot;K. z. orientalis&quot; Delacour, 1926 – northeast Myanmar to southeast China, Indochina and the Malay Peninsula

Results of a phylogenetic analysis of nine horned owl species indicate that &quot;Ketupa&quot; species form a monophyletic group.

=== Fossil records ===
In prehistoric times, this species may have been present across the central and eastern Mediterranean basin, in particular on islands. The Late Pleistocene &quot;Bubo insularis&quot; is typically considered to include the fragmentary remains originally described as &quot;Ophthalmomegas lamarmorae&quot; due to a mix-up with the fossil macaque &quot;Macaca majori&quot; and subsequently unstudied for many decades. Its fossil bones suggest a bird the size of a large spotted eagle-owl (&quot;B. africanus&quot;), a bit smaller still than the smallest living fish owls. It was certainly smallish but long-legged by eagle-owl standards, and its wing proportions differed conspicuously from a typical horned eagle owl. On the other hand, its leg and foot bones were more similar to those of a typical eagle-owl. Some consider it a specialized paleosubspecies of the brown fish owl that became extinct during the third Würm glaciation, while others reported remains of &quot;B. &quot;insularis&quot; in the Holocene of Sardinia and until the beginning of Roman Sardinia, with no subspecies being recognized.

The oldest remains date back at least to the Early Pliocene, about 5 million years ago. It was probably widely distributed around 120,000 years ago. After the onset of the last glacial period, less than 100,000 years ago, it disappeared from the western part of its range. The Late Miocene-Early Pliocene &quot;Strix&quot; perpasta&quot; is unlikely to belong in that genus, and also sometimes merged with &quot;B. insularis&quot;.

==Description==

The brown fish owl has prominent ear tufts and rufous brown upperparts that are heavily streaked with black or dark brown. Its underparts are buffy-fulvous to whitish, with wavy dark brown streaks and finer brown barring. Its throat is white and conspicuously puffed. Its facial disk is indistinct, the bill dark and the iris golden yellow. Its featherless feet are yellow. Two-year old brown fish owls are somewhat paler than adults. Female and male differ slightly in size.

In body size, it ranges from with a wingspan from . Its weight varies considerably, ranging from . Some of the variability is attributed to the range of sizes across the subspecies. Also, females are invariably at least somewhat larger than males and condition of birds is variable. It is slightly larger than the buffy fish owl with a darker brown hue.

Compared to eagle owls of similar length, fish owls tend to be even shorter in tail length and even heavier in build, have relatively larger wings, have considerably longer legs, and have a rough texture to the bottom of their toes. At least the latter two features are clear adaptations to aid these owls in capturing fish. Diurnal raptors who feed largely on fish have similar, if not identical, rough texture under their toes, which helps these birds grasp slippery fish. Unlike diurnal raptors who capture fish such as the osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;) as compared to most terrestrial raptors, the fish owls have large, powerful, and curved talons and a longitudinal sharp keel sitting under the middle claw with all having sharp cutting edges that are very much like those of eagle owls. Also, unlike fish-eating diurnal raptors will not submerge any part of their body while hunting, preferring only to put their feet into the water, although fish owls will hunt on foot, wading into the shallows. Unlike most owls, the feathers of fish owls are not soft to the touch and they lack the comb and hair-like fringes to the primaries, which allow other owls to fly silently in order to ambush their prey. Due to the lack of these feather-specializations, fish owl wing beats make sounds. The brown fish owl in particular is said to have a noisy wing beat, sometimes described as producing a singing sound, but another description claimed they could be &quot;as silent as any other owl&quot; in flight. The lack of a deep facial disc in fish owls is another indication of the unimportance of sound relative to vision in these owls, as facial disc depth (as well as inner ear size) are directly related to how important sound is to an owl&#x27;s hunting behavior. Also different from most any other kind of owl, the bill is placed on the face between the eyes rather below it, which is said to impart this fish owl with a &quot;remarkably morose and sinister expression&quot;. Similar adaptations, such as unwillingness to submerge beyond their legs and lack of sound-muffling feathers are also seen in the African fishing owls, which do not seem to be directly related. The brown fish owl has sometimes been regarded as conspecific with the Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl (&quot;B. blakistoni&quot;), but there is an approximately gap in their distributions, not to mention a large number of physical differences not the least of which is the Blakiston&#x27;s considerably greater size.

===Subspecies===
*Sri Lankan brown fish owl (&quot;K. zeylonensis zeylonensis&quot;) is the smallest and darkest coloured subspecies with a wing chord of , a tarsus of , a tail of , and a bill of . The wing length averages 92% shorter than in northern subspecies. One male was found to have weighed .
*Common brown fish owl (&quot;K. z. leschenaultii&quot;) occurs from the Indian subcontinent to Myanmar and Thailand. It is of medium hue with lighter markings than the nominate subspecies. It has a wing chord of , a tail of , a tarsus of and a bill of . The wing chord of 16 males in India averaged and their bills averaged while 15 females averaged in wing chord and in bill length. A male was found to weigh and a female was found to weigh .
*Western brown fish owl (&quot;K. z. semenowi&quot;) occurs from southern Turkey through Iran and Pakistan to northeastern India. It is paler and slightly larger than the common brown fish owl with a somewhat tawny hue. Its wing chord is with a tarsus of , a tail of and a bill of .
*Eastern brown fish owl (&quot;K. z. orientalis&quot;) occurs in north-eastern Myanmar, Vietnam and southeastern China and Hainan Island. It is somewhat darker than the common brown fish owl with a larger tarsus. Its wing chord is , with a tail of and a tarsus of .

==Distribution and habitat==

The brown fish owl is an all-year resident throughout most tropical and subtropical parts of the Indian Subcontinent to Southeast Asia and adjoining regions. West of its main range, it is patchily distributed to the Levant (possibly extinct) and southern Asia Minor (recently rediscovered). The typical habitat of brown fish owls is forest and woodland bordering streams, lakes or rice fields. It inhabits mainly the lowlands, from open woodland to dense forest as well as in plantations; in the Himalayas foothills it ranges into submontane forest up to above mean sea level or so but not higher. It frequently spends the day in stands of bamboo or other large shady trees. They be found around water reservoirs, along canals, on the outskirts of villages and along sea coasts. Western birds are found in semiarid landscape and may breed in oases in arid regions. Regardless of habitat, it rarely strays far from larger bodies of water such as rivers and lakes.
Being a large predatory bird, the brown fish owl is only rarely found at a high population density, an exception being Sri Lanka, where this particular owl&#x27;s adaptability to human habitat change has been beneficial in continued high numbers.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The calls of the buffy fish owl are described as a deep humming &quot;boom-uh-boom&quot;, a &quot;hup hup hu&quot; and a loud &quot;huhuhuhuhuhuhu&quot;. A trisyllabic &quot;tu-hoo-hoo&quot; is seemingly the territorial song emitted before breeding. Its call has been described as comparable to that of a distant Eurasian bittern (&quot;Botaurus stellaris&quot;).

The buffy fish owl is nocturnal but can often be located by the small birds that mob it while roosting in a tree. However, in some areas it may be semi-diurnal and has been seen hunting during daytime, especially in cloudy weather. Brown fish owl primarily hunt by stationing itself on a rock overhang or hanging perch over water, or by wading into shallow waters. It grabs food by gliding over the water, nearly skimming it with its feet and grabbing its prey by quickly extending its long legs. It feeds mainly on fishes, frogs and aquatic crustaceans, especially &quot;Potamon&quot; crabs. It usually selects the larger freshwater fish available in waterways. Compared to the tawny fish owl, which prefers flowing waters, brown fish owls frequently hunt in still or stagnant waters. By number in the Melghat Tiger Reserve in India, freshwater crabs of the family Gecarcinucidae (of genus &quot;Barytelphusa&quot;) almost totally dominated the diet. Brown fish owls may be attracted to ornamental fish ponds or commercial fisheries in order to exploit the easily caught fish at such locations. Amniotes, in particular terrestrial ones, are seldom taken. However, other recorded foods have included snakes, lizards, water beetles, other insects, small mammals (including bats) and occasionally water birds. In Melghat, the largest biomass of food consisted of small mammals, namely rats (&quot;Rattus&quot; ssp.), other types of murids and Asian house shrews (&quot;Suncus murinus&quot;). Birds hunted by brown fish owls have including lesser whistling duck (&quot;Dendrocygna javanica&quot;) and Indian pond heron (&quot;Ardeola grayii&quot;). One unusual prey item recorded was a long monitor lizard. Competition may occur between this species and Pallas&#x27;s fish eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucoryphus&quot;) as well as dusky eagle owls (&quot;B. coromandus&quot;), but the brown fish owl is more terrestrial than the fish eagle and consumes more invertebrates than either of those species, the eagle feeding mainly on fish followed by water birds and the eagle owl feeding mainly on mammals followed by land birds. If hungry, brown fish owls will scavenge carrion, a rare behavior for owls. A case where a putrefying crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus&quot; ssp.) carcass was consumed by this species was observed.

As mentioned above, the prehistoric &quot;B. insularis&quot; is sometimes included in the brown fish owl. If this is correct, the different foot anatomy, more similar to that of a typical eagle-owl, would imply that the population had shifted back to terrestrial prey. A likely prey item in this case would have been the Sardinian pika (&quot;Prolagus sardus&quot;). It has been conjectured that the owls disappeared with their prey due to climate change, but the giant pikas of Sardinia and Corsica still existed around 1750, finally succumbing to habitat destruction, introduced predatory mammals and overhunting soon thereafter.

=== Reproduction ===

Brown fish owls breed from November to April, with activity tending to peak a bit earlier in the north of their breeding range and a bit later in the more tropical south of their breeding range. The breeding season is concurrent with the dry season, which has the benefit of low water levels and thus crabs and fish being more readily assessible. However, most other owls and diurnal raptors also primarily breed in the dry season as well. As owls do not build nest, brown fish owls are somewhat opportunistic when it comes to nesting sites. Brown fish owls frequently nest in shady spots such as old-growth mango trees (&quot;Mangifera&quot; ssp.), fig trees, including &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot; and &quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot;, &quot;Shorea robusta&quot; and other large trees in lowland forests. Outside of the bare surface of large branches, nests are often in spots such as overgrown eroded ravines and steep riverbanks with natural holes. However, it may also nest near suitable villages, along wet roadsides, &quot;jheels&quot;, canals and rice fields. Usually nest are large natural holes, in hollows or at the base of large branches. Deserted nest built by fish eagles and vultures are also sometimes used as nesting locations. Other nesting sites have included rock ledges, caves in shady cliff faces and stone ruins. The clutch is two or occasionally just one egg. 10 eggs in India averaged in sizes, with eggs of fish owls to the north averaging slightly larger. Incubation is 38 days or somewhat less, and the young fledge after about seven weeks. The downy chicks are mostly an off-white color and develop into a paler version of adults by their second year.

== Threats ==
Apparently in India, during the festival of Diwali, thousands of owls are killed - though programs to counter this practice are underway - including this species due to superstitious beliefs about the evil nature of owls and as an attempt to gain the power of black magic. Habitat destruction will eventually cause the species to desert a region. Due to this, it seems to be extinct as a breeding bird in Israel nowadays, attributable largely to damming practices leading to drying up of many waterways. In Israel, it was decimated by the use of the rodenticide thallium(I) sulfate, which in addition to potential direct exposure through rodents also poisons surface waters.

<text>Peter Glotz (6 March 1939 – 25 August 2005) was a German social democratic politician and social scientist.

==Biography==
Peter Glotz was born in Cheb, Czechoslovakia, to a German father and a Czech mother. His father, an insurance clerk joined the Nazi Party and administered a small &quot;Aryanized&quot; Jewish factory in Prague. His family was expelled from Czechoslovakia in September 1945 and settled in Franconia. He studied Journalism, Philosophy, Germanistics, and Sociology at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the University of Vienna, and became a doctor of philosophy in 1968.

Glotz became director of Ludwig Maximilian University in 1969 and a member of the Landtag of Bavaria in 1970. He was a member of the German parliament from 1972 to 1977 and a parliamentary state secretary of the Federal Minister for Education and Research from 1974 until 1977.

From 1977 to 1981 Glotz was a senator for science and research in the state of Berlin, and became a member of the parliament again in 1983, resigning in 1996. He was secretary general of the SPD from 1981 to 1987. Glotz then became founding director of the University of Erfurt (1996–1999) and professor of communication sciences.

From January 2000 until he died in Zürich, Glotz was a Professor of media and society at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland. In 2002, he was a representative of the German Chancellor to the European Convention. With Erika Steinbach, he was chairman of the &quot;Centre Against Expulsions&quot; Foundation.

<text>The brown boobook (Ninox scutulata), also known as the brown hawk-owl, is an owl which is a resident breeder in south Asia from India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal east to western Indonesia and south China.

This species is a part of the larger grouping of owls known as typical owls, Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping is the barn owls, Tytonidae.

==Taxonomy==
The brown boobook was formally described in 1822 by Stamford Raffles from a specimen collected in Sumatra under the binomial name &quot;Strix scutulata&quot;. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;scutulatus &quot; meaning &quot;diamond-shaped&quot;. The brown boobook is now placed with the other boobooks in the genus &quot;Ninox&quot; that was introduced by the English naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1837.

Nine subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;N. s. lugubris&quot; — north, northeast, central India and Nepal
* &quot;N. s. burmanica&quot; — northeast India to south China, Indochina and Thailand
* &quot;N. s. hirsuta&quot; — south India and Sri Lanka
* &quot;N. s. isolata&quot; — Car Nicobar
* &quot;N. s. rexpimenti&quot; — Great Nicobar Island
* &quot;N. s. scutulata&quot; — Malay Peninsula, Riau Archipelago, Sumatra and Bangka Island
* &quot;N. s. javanensis&quot; — west Java
* &quot;N. s. borneensis&quot; — Borneo and north Natuna Islands
* &quot;N. s. palawanensis&quot; — Palawan (west Philippines)

==Description==
The brown boobook is a medium-sized owl with a length of . It has a hawk-like shape due to its long tail and lack of a distinct facial disk. The upperparts are dark brown, with a barred tail. The underparts are whitish with reddish-brown streaking, although the subspecies found in the Andaman Islands has dark brown underparts. The eyes are large and yellow. Sexes are similar.

This species is very nocturnal but it can often be located by the small birds that mob it while it is roosting in a tree. It feeds mainly on large insects, frogs, lizards, small birds, and mice. The call is a repeated low soft, musical &quot;oo-uk ...ooo-uk...&quot; which may be heard at dusk and dawn. This owl is quite common in towns and cities like Colombo, Sri Lanka, as well as suburban areas close to buildings.

==Distribution and habitat==
The brown boobook is a resident breeder in most of tropical south Asia from the Middle East to south China. Its habitat is well-wooded country and forest. It lays three to five eggs in a tree hole.

There are two records of the brown boobook in the western hemisphere: an individual photographed on St. Paul Island, Alaska, on August 27, 2007, and a dead owl found on Kiska Island in 2008.

<text>A circuit diagram (or: wiring diagram, electrical diagram, elementary diagram, electronic schematic) is a graphical representation of an electrical circuit. A pictorial circuit diagram uses simple images of components, while a schematic diagram shows the components and interconnections of the circuit using standardized symbolic representations. The presentation of the interconnections between circuit components in the schematic diagram does not necessarily correspond to the physical arrangements in the finished device.

Unlike a block diagram or layout diagram, a circuit diagram shows the actual electrical connections. A drawing meant to depict the physical arrangement of the wires and the components they connect is called &quot;artwork&quot; or &quot;layout&quot;, &quot;physical design&quot;, or &quot;wiring diagram&quot;.

Circuit diagrams are used for the design (circuit design), construction (such as PCB layout), and maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment.

In computer science, circuit diagrams are useful when visualizing expressions using Boolean algebra.

==Symbols==

Circuit diagrams are pictures with symbols that have differed from country to country and have changed over time, but are now to a large extent internationally standardized. Simple components often had symbols intended to represent some feature of the physical construction of the device. For example, the symbol for a resistor dates back to the time when that component was made from a long piece of wire wrapped in such a manner as to not produce inductance, which would have made it a coil. These wirewound resistors are now used only in high-power applications, smaller resistors being cast from &quot;carbon composition&quot; (a mixture of carbon and filler) or fabricated as an insulating tube or chip coated with a metal film. The internationally standardized symbol for a resistor is therefore now simplified to an oblong, sometimes with the value in ohms written inside, instead of the zig-zag symbol. A less common symbol is simply a series of peaks on one side of the line representing the conductor, rather than back-and-forth.

The linkages between leads were once simple crossings of lines. With the arrival of computerized drafting, the connection of two intersecting wires was shown by a crossing of wires with a &quot;dot&quot; or &quot;blob&quot; to indicate a connection. At the same time, the crossover was simplified to be the same crossing, but without a &quot;dot&quot;. However, there was a danger of confusing the wires that were connected and not connected in this manner, if the dot was drawn too small or accidentally omitted (e.g. the &quot;dot&quot; could disappear after several passes through a copy machine). As such, the modern practice for representing a 4-way wire connection is to draw a straight wire and then to draw the other wires staggered along it with &quot;dots&quot; as connections (see diagram), so as to form two separate T-junctions that brook no confusion and are clearly not a crossover.

For crossing wires that are insulated from one another, a small semi-circle symbol is commonly used to show one wire &quot;jumping over&quot; the other wire (similar to how jumper wires are used).

A common, hybrid style of drawing combines the T-junction crossovers with &quot;dot&quot; connections and the wire &quot;jump&quot; semi-circle symbols for insulated crossings. In this manner, a &quot;dot&quot; that is too small to see or that has accidentally disappeared can still be clearly differentiated from a &quot;jump&quot;.

On a circuit diagram, the symbols for components are labelled with a descriptor or reference designator matching that on the list of parts. For example, C1 is the first capacitor, L1 is the first inductor, Q1 is the first transistor, and R1 is the first resistor. Often the value or type designation of the component is given on the diagram beside the part, but detailed specifications would go on the parts list.

Detailed rules for reference designations are provided in the International standard IEC 61346.

==Organization==
It is a usual (although not universal) convention that schematic drawings are organized on the page from left to right and top to bottom in the same sequence as the flow of the main signal or power path. For example, a schematic for a radio receiver might start with the antenna input at the left of the page and end with the loudspeaker at the right. Positive power supply connections for each stage would be shown towards the top of the page, with grounds, negative supplies, or other return paths towards the bottom. Schematic drawings intended for maintenance may have the principal signal paths highlighted to assist in understanding the signal flow through the circuit. More complex devices have multi-page schematics and must rely on cross-reference symbols to show the flow of signals between the different sheets of the drawing.

Detailed rules for the preparation of circuit diagrams, and other document types used in electrotechnology, are provided in the international standard IEC 61082-1.

Circuit diagrams are often drawn with the same standardized title block and frame as other engineering drawings.

Relay logic line diagrams, also called ladder logic diagrams, use another common standardized convention for organizing schematic drawings, with a vertical power supply rail on the left and another on the right, and components strung between them like the rungs of a ladder.

==Artwork==

Once the schematic has been made, it is converted into a layout that can be fabricated onto a printed circuit board (PCB). Schematic-driven layout starts with the process of schematic capture. The result is what is known as a . The rat&#x27;s nest is a jumble of wires (lines) criss-crossing each other to their destination nodes. These wires are routed either manually or automatically by the use of electronics design automation (EDA) tools. The EDA tools arrange and rearrange the placement of components and find paths for tracks to connect various nodes. This results in the final layout artwork for the integrated circuit or printed circuit board.

A generalized design flow may be as follows:
:Schematic → schematic capture → netlist → rat&#x27;s nest → routing → artwork → PCB development and etching → component mounting → testing

==Education==
Teaching about the functioning of electrical circuits is often on primary and secondary school curricula. Students are expected to understand the rudiments of circuit diagrams and their functioning. Use of diagrammatic representations of circuit diagrams can aid understanding of principles of electricity.

Principles of the physics of circuit diagrams are often taught with the use of analogies, such as comparing functioning of circuits to other closed systems such as water heating systems with pumps being the equivalent to batteries.

<doc id="587350" wikidata="Q2252799" url="?curid=587350" title="Cremasteric reflex">
<text>The cremasteric reflex is a superficial (i.e., close to the skin&#x27;s surface) reflex observed in human males.

This reflex is elicited by lightly stroking or poking the superior and medial (inner) part of the thigh—regardless of the direction of stroke. The normal response is an immediate contraction of the cremaster muscle that pulls up the testicle ipsilaterally (on the same side of the body).
The reflex utilizes sensory and motor fibers from two different nerves. When the inner thigh is stroked, sensory fibers of the ilioinguinal nerve are stimulated. These activate the motor fibers of the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve which causes the cremaster muscle to contract and elevate the testis.

==Clinical conditions==
In some males this reflex may be exaggerated which can occasionally lead to a misdiagnosis of cryptorchidism.

The cremasteric reflex may be absent with testicular torsion, upper and lower motor neuron disorders, as well as a spine injury of L1-L2. It can also occur if the ilioinguinal nerve has accidentally been cut during a hernia repair.
The cremasteric reflex can be helpful in recognizing testicular emergencies. The presence of the cremasteric reflex does not eliminate testicular torsion from a differential diagnosis, but it does broaden the possibilities to include epididymitis or other causes of scrotal and testicular pain. In any event, if testicular torsion cannot be definitively eliminated in an expeditious manner, a testicular Doppler ultrasound or exploratory surgical intervention is usually implemented to prevent possible loss of the testicle to necrosis.

<text>The World Indoor Soccer League (WISL) was a United States–based indoor soccer league that operated from 1998 to 2001 and consisted of nine teams.

==History==
After the demise of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, four of its teams decided to create a new indoor league to be called the Premier Soccer Alliance in 1998. The teams complemented their schedules with games against international teams. In 1999, two more former CISL teams (the Houston Hotshots and Monterrey La Raza) joined the league, which then changed its name to World Indoor Soccer League.

The World Indoor Soccer League (WISL) was formed through a merger between the US-based Premier Soccer Alliance and an English Indoor Football League, resulting in a name change from the original Premier Soccer League Alliance in 1999. Initially, plans included a European Division with teams like London United and Manchester Magic, but this concept was scrapped due to conflicting rules and lack of approval from The Football Association.

In 2000, the World Indoor Soccer League (WISL) considered a groundbreaking move, attempting to become the first U.S. professional sports league to sell its naming rights. The proposed deal would have resulted in a rebranded league, potentially named &quot;The Pepsi World Indoor Soccer League.&quot; However, the effort ultimately did not come to fruition.

The WISL folded in December 2001 when Dallas, St. Louis, and San Diego agreed to join the MISL while the remaining teams, the Utah Freezz, the Sacramento Knights and the Houston Hotshots folded.

<text>St. Herman&#x27;s Blue Hole National Park is a national park located just off the Hummingbird Highway in Cayo District of Belize, near Belmopan, the capital city. It is over 500 acres (2 km²) in area, and contains two cave systems (St. Hermans and Crystal), various natural trails, and the cool jungle pool from which the park gets its name. The park is managed by the Belize Audubon Society.

This inland &quot;blue hole&quot; is not to be confused with the offshore Great Blue Hole, also in Belize.

==History==
The Government of Belize acquired the land for the park in the 1960s and &#x27;70s. It was officially declared a national park on November 23, 1986. The park was originally named Blue Hole National Park, but its name was changed in 2005 in order to avoid confusion with Blue Hole National Monument.

==Flora and fauna==
The park has over 200 species of birds, including unusual tropical species such as the slaty antwren, piratic flycatcher and red-legged honeycreeper. Species considered local specialties are tody motmot and northern nightingale-wren.

The ocelot, jaguarundi, and jaguar have all been recorded in Blue Hole National Park.

<doc id="587362" wikidata="Q3586319" url="?curid=587362" title="1999 Manitoba general election">
<text>The 1999 Manitoba general election was held on September 21, 1999 to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba, Canada.

The New Democratic Party (NDP) was returned to government after sitting in opposition since the 1988 election. The NDP won 32 seats, against 24 for the Progressive Conservative Party. The Manitoba Liberal Party won one seat.

The Manitoba PC Party declined in popularity due to unpopular budget cuts on the healthcare system, social programs, and civil servants. The budget cuts on Public Service employees resulted in &quot;Filmon Fridays&quot; where civil servants had to take 10 unpaid days off each year. A vote splitting scandal has also hurt the Manitoba PC Party&#x27;s reputation when the Independent Native Voice Party was claimed to be funded by the PC Caucus in attempt to take away votes from the NDP during the 1995 election.

<doc id="587368" wikidata="Q386261" url="?curid=587368" title="Lacydes of Cyrene">
<text>Lacydes of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] (), Academic Skeptic philosopher, was head of the Platonic Academy at Athens in succession to Arcesilaus from 241 BC. He was forced to resign c. 215 BC due to ill-health, and he died c. 205 BC. Nothing survives of his works.

==Life==
He was born in Cyrene, the son of Alexander. In his youth he was poor, but remarkable for his industry, as well as for his affable and engaging manners. He moved to Athens, and attached himself to the Middle Academy, according to a silly story quoted by Eusebius from Numenius, because the ease with which his servants robbed him without being detected, convinced him that no reliance could be placed on the evidence of the senses. He was a disciple of Arcesilaus, and succeeded him as head (scholarch) of the school in 241 BC, over which he presided for 26 years. The place where his instructions were delivered was a garden, named the &quot;Lacydeum&quot; (), provided for the purpose by his friend Attalus I of Pergamon. He resigned his position in 216/5 BC, because of ill-health, and for the final ten years of his life the Academy was run by a council led by Evander and Telecles, who succeeded him to jointly run the Academy after his death in 206/5 BC. According to Diogenes Laërtius he died from excessive drinking, but the story is discredited by the eulogy of Eusebius that he was in all things moderate.

==Philosophy==
In his philosophical views he followed Arcesilaus closely. He is said to have written treatises, including one entitled &quot;On Nature&quot;, but nothing survives. Apart from a number of anecdotes distinguished for their sarcastic humour, Lacydes has the reputation of a man of refined character, a hard worker, and an accomplished orator.

Big O Tires is one of North America&#x27;s largest retail tire franchisors, with more than 450 independently owned and operated locations extending through 23 states primarily in the Western and Midwestern United States.

==History==

The company was founded in 1962, when it split from OK Tires, it was headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. In 1996, it was acquired by TBC Corporation, which also owns Tire Kingdom and NTB. In 2006, TBC was acquired by Sumitomo Corporation of Americas. In 2018, Michelin North America Inc. (MNAI) and Sumitomo Corporation of Americas (SCOA) announced a definitive agreement to combine their respective North American replacement tire distribution and related service operations in a 50–50 joint venture. Big O Tires remains a wholly owned subsidiary of TBC Corporation. 

In a landmark case in 1977, Big O Tires was awarded $19.6 million from Goodyear over Goodyear&#x27;s use of the name &quot;bigfoot&quot; tires. The amount equaled 25% of Goodyear&#x27;s advertising budget in the states where Big O operated. The amount was reduced on appeal and the case was later settled.

<text>The National Standards of the Republic of China (CNS; ) is the national standard of Taiwan, officially the Republic of China. These standards were established in 1946, and administered by the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (&quot;BSMI&quot;) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan. These standards are divided into 26 numbered categories. Applying the National Standards is voluntary unless authorities in charge cite any parts of the standards as laws and regulations. By the end of 2003, more than 15000 national standards have been issued. Although the Republic of China was removed in 1950 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for failure to pay membership dues accordingly, there are still many National Standards translated from ISO standards into Chinese. A few standards also have English versions, but in case of any divergence of interpretation, the Chinese text shall prevail.

==Selected Sections==
Each standard has a general number and may be prefixed with &quot;CNS&quot;, such as &quot;CNS 11296&quot;. The general numbers, English names and any similar ISO standards of some standards are listed below:

<text>Clematis lasiantha, the pipestem clematis, is a creamy-white flowering liana vine, belonging to subgenus &quot;Clematis&quot; of the large genus &quot;Clematis&quot;.

==Distribution==
It is found on the Pacific coast of North America, from the San Francisco Bay Area southwards into Baja California. It extends as far east as the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains, but does not grow in the Central Valley, nor at heights greater than about . It grows on hillsides, in chaparral, and in open woodland.

==Description==
&quot;Clematis lasiantha&quot;, the pipestem clematis, flowers from January to June. Its leaves are 3-lobed, and generally grow groups of three to five leaflets, the largest leaves on the plant normally being between 3 and 5 cm in size. The pipestem clematis can be distinguished from the similar (but much more widely ranging) virgin&#x27;s bower by the fact that pipestems normally only have one flower on each stalk, and at most three, whereas the virgin&#x27;s bower has multiple flowers on each stem. The pipestem also has more pistils in each flower, but since both species have many, this is not an easy criterion to apply. The virgin&#x27;s bower is more likely to be found along streams or in other wet places, whereas the pipestem tolerates more open, drier places. The plant attracts butterflies.

<text>The Samaritan Hebrew script, or simply Samaritan script is used by the Samaritans for religious writings, including the Samaritan Pentateuch, writings in Samaritan Hebrew, and for commentaries and translations in Samaritan Aramaic and occasionally Arabic.
Samaritan is a direct descendant of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet, which was a variety of the Phoenician alphabet. Paleo-Hebrew is the alphabet in which large parts of the Hebrew Bible were originally penned according to the consensus of most scholars, who also believe that these scripts are descendants of the Proto-Sinaitic script. Paleo-Hebrew script was used by the ancient Israelites, both Jews and Samaritans.

The better-known &quot;square script&quot; Hebrew alphabet which has been traditionally used by Jews since the Babylonian exile is a stylized version of the Aramaic alphabet called Ashurit (כתב אשורי).

Historically, the Aramaic alphabet became distinct from Phoenician/Paleo-Hebrew in the 8th century BCE. After the fall of the Persian Empire, Judaism used both scripts before settling on the Aramaic form, henceforth de facto becoming the &quot;Hebrew alphabet&quot; since it was repurposed to write Hebrew. For a limited time thereafter, the use of paleo-Hebrew (proto-Samaritan) among Jews was retained only to write the Tetragrammaton, but soon that custom was also abandoned.

A cursive style of the alphabet also exists.

The Samaritan alphabet first became known to the Western world with the publication of a manuscript of the Samaritan Pentateuch in 1631 by Jean Morin. In 1616 the traveler Pietro della Valle had purchased a copy of the text in Damascus, and this manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a Parisian library.

<doc id="587393" wikidata="Q7990631" url="?curid=587393" title="Whangdoodle">
<text>The Whangdoodle is a fanciful or humorous being whose undefined appearance and essence is left to individual imagination. Other connotations may include an object of humor, something noisy but of no consequence and insignificant.

==19th-century usage==
It appeared in 1858 as a title for and text within a parody sermon &quot;Where the lion roareth and the wang-doodle mourneth,&quot; published in Samuel Putnam Avery&#x27;s &quot;The Harp of a Thousand Strings: Or, Laughter for a Lifetime&quot;. Possibly due to its resemblance to or formation from existing words &quot;whang&quot; and &quot;doodle&quot;, it soon became common to spell it as &quot;whangdoodle&quot;.
The term appeared derisively in 1859 correspondence published in &quot;The Cincinnati Lancet &amp; Observer&quot;. Mark Twain used it disparagingly in a letter in 1862. By 1877 it had been included in a dictionary.

==20th-century usage==
The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica listed this definition in the Poker article: 

==20th-century literature==

In children&#x27;s literature by British authors Roald Dahl and Julie Andrews, a whangdoodle is portrayed as dismayed and discontent, or a creature of sorrow.

===Roald Dahl books===
;&quot;The Minpins&quot;
One of the main characters is warned by his mother against a forest where Whangdoodles and other monsters live (though the only monster he does meet there is the Gruncher).

;&quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;
One of the firemen in New York City refers to the centipede as a Whangdoodle.

;&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;
Willy Wonka mentions that he saved the Oompa Loompas from being preyed upon by Whangdoodles and various other monsters. Whangdoodles are described as particularly &quot;terrible&quot; and &quot;wicked&quot;.

;&quot;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator&quot;
One of the ingredients for Wonka-Vite is &quot;the hide (and the seek) of a spotted Whangdoodle&quot;.

===The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles===

A different Whangdoodle is described in the children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles&quot; by singer and actress Dame Julie Andrews (under her married name of Julie Edwards): an intelligent, ungulate-like character capable of changing color to suit its emotions or blend into its surroundings, from whose hind legs grow a new and different set of bedroom slippers each year. It is introduced to the protagonists Ben, Tom, and Lindy, and thus to the reader, by the geneticist &#x27;Professor Savant&#x27;, a scholar of the Whangdoodle and its secret domain. Attempting to visit both, the scientist and children are opposed by the antagonist &#x27;Prock&#x27; (the Whangdoodle&#x27;s second-in-command), until his resources are exhausted by their tenacity. With Prock persuaded to grant their passage, the children discover that the Whangdoodle is oppressed by want of a mate, and convince Savant to create the latter. With this done, the two Whangdoodles are to be wedded at a great celebration, and the children return to their home.

===The Big Rock Candy Mountain===
Some versions of the song &quot;The Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; include a mention of a Whangdoodle singing in the titular hobo&#x27;s paradise. This is the case in the version written down and arranged by Charles and Ruth Seeger. This version is used in the Frederic Rzewski composition for violin, piano, and percussion, titled &quot;Whangdoodles&quot;.

<doc id="587394" wikidata="Q77323" url="?curid=587394" title="Walter Warlimont">
<text>Walter Warlimont (3 October 1894 – 9 October 1976) was a German Army staff officer and general during World War II. He served as deputy chief of the Operations Staff, one of departments in the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW), the Armed Forces High Command. Following the war, Warlimont was convicted in the High Command Trial and sentenced to life imprisonment as a war criminal. He was released in 1954.

== World War I and inter-war years==

Warlimont was born in Osnabrück, Germany. In June 1914, just before the start of World War I, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 10th Prussian Foot Artillery Regiment based in Alsace. During the war, he served as an artillery officer and battery commander in France and later in Italy. In late 1918, he served in General Ludwig Maercker&#x27;s Freikorps Jäger rifle corps.

In the inter-war years, Warlimont served in various military roles. In 1922, he served in the 6th Artillery Regiment and in 1927, as a captain, he was the second adjutant to General Werner von Blomberg, chief of the Truppenamt, the covert German General Staff. In May 1929, Warlimont was attached to the U.S. Army for a year to study American industrial mobilization theory during wartime. This led to his service between 1930 and 1933 as a major on the staff of the Industrial Mobilization Section of the German Defence Ministry. He became the Section&#x27;s chief in 1935.

Between August and November 1936, following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Warlimont served as the Reich War Minister (OKH General Staff)&#x27;s Wehrmacht Plenipotentiary Delegate to the government of Spanish General Francisco Franco in Spain. Reich War Minister Werner von Blomberg directed Warlimont to coordinate German aid in support of Franco&#x27;s battle against the Spanish government forces.

In 1937, he wrote the &quot;Warlimont Memorandum&quot; calling for the reorganisation of the German armed forces under one staff unit and one supreme commander. The plan was to limit the power of the high officer caste in favour of Adolf Hitler. On the basis of this memorandum, Hitler developed the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (High command of the armed forces), with Hitler as supreme commander. Warlimont was rewarded in 1939 with a post as deputy to General Alfred Jodl. In 1938 he was promoted to colonel and became commander of the 26th Artillery Regiment.

== World War II ==
In late 1938, Warlimont became Senior Operations Staff Officer to General Wilhelm Keitel. This was a coveted position, and so between September 1939 and September 1944 he served as Deputy Chief of the Operations Staff (&quot;Wehrmachtführungsstab&quot;: WFSt: Armed Forces Operations Staff). General Jodl was his superior officer, who served as Chief of the Operations Staff, which was responsible for all strategic, executive and war-operations planning.

While serving on this military operations planning staff, in early 1939 he assisted in developing some of the German military invasion plans of Poland. On 1 September 1939, German military forces invaded Poland, thereby starting World War II.

1940 saw his promotion to &quot;Generalmajor&quot;, and he assisted in developing the invasion plans of France. During the Battle of France, on June 14, 1940, Warlimont, in an audacious move, asked the pilot of his personal Fieseler Storch to land on the Place de la Concorde in central Paris. In 1941, he continued to assist in developing invasion operations into Russia. This earned his promotion to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; in 1942.

His meteoric advancement in rank almost sputtered out on 3 November 1942 when he was relieved of his job after a junior subordinate failed to process a message from Field Marshal Erwin Rommel sufficiently promptly. However, only five days later he was recalled to duty to visit the French Vichy Government in France to coordinate the defense of their colonial territories from possible occupation by the Allies.

In February 1943, Warlimont travelled to Tunis to confer with Rommel as to whether or not the Germans should abandon North Africa.

In early 1944, Warlimont was promoted to General of the Artillery. As Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces Operations Staff, he continued to give almost daily briefings to Hitler regarding the status of German military operations.

On D-Day, when the Allies invaded Normandy, France, Warlimont telephoned Jodl to request that the German tanks in Normandy should be released to attack the Allied invaders. Jodl responded that he did not want to make that decision; they would have to wait until Hitler awoke. Once Hitler awoke and authorised the release of the tanks for a counter-attack, it was too late to blunt the successful Allied invasion. The following day, Hitler sent Warlimont to inspect the German defences in Italy.

On 20 July 1944, Warlimont was wounded during the assassination bombing against Hitler in a war-briefing building in Rastenburg. He suffered a mild head concussion. Later in the day, he telephoned Field Marshal Günther von Kluge and convinced him that Hitler was alive; this prompted Kluge not to continue in the anti-Hitler coup. Even though Warlimont was wounded alongside Hitler, he was wrongly suspected of having been involved in the anti-Hitler conspiracy. In spite of this, he belatedly received the special 20th of July Wound Badge, which was awarded only to those few wounded or killed in the 20 July explosion.

On 22 July, Warlimont travelled to France to meet with Field Marshal Rommel (who had been wounded a week earlier by an Allied aeroplane attack) and Rommel&#x27;s naval aide Vice Admiral Friedrich Ruge, to discuss the deteriorating battlefield situation in Normandy.

Even though Hitler (in Wolfsschanze) ordered Warlimont to travel to Paris on 1 August to study the German military situation there with Field Marshal von Kluge, Hitler thought that Warlimont might have been involved in the conspiracy to have him assassinated (an action which Warlimont denied). On 2 August, Warlimont met outside Paris with General Günther Blumentritt and advised him that Hitler wanted the Germans to regain the offensive initiative against the Allies through Operation Lüttich. Later, Warlimont urged General Heinrich Eberbach to continue his attacks in the Falaise pocket region. Although all the German generals informed Warlimont that they believed the attack would fail, he cabled Hitler that the generals were &quot;confident of success&quot;.

At Warlimont&#x27;s request, due to his dizzy spells resulting from the 20 July assassination bombing against Hitler, he was transferred and retired to the OKH Command Pool (the &quot;Führerreserve&quot;), and was not further employed during the war.

== Trial and conviction ==

In October 1948, Warlimont was tried before a United States military tribunal in the High Command Trial, part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, in part for his responsibility for drafting the Barbarossa Jurisdiction Order which allowed the murder of civilians on the pretext of counteracting partisan activity. He also signed the order to execute Russian political Commissars on sight. His sentence was reviewed by the &quot;Peck Panel&quot;, which made a more lenient recommendation. This leniency was heavily criticized by Robert R. Bowie who stated: &quot;they Reinecke, Kuechler and Warlimont] were all directly implicated in the program which encompassed the murder of commandos, commissars and captured allied airmen as well as in brutal mistreatment of prisoners of war&quot;. His sentence was commuted to 18 years in 1951. He was released in June 1954.

== Personal life ==
Walter Warlimont was a son of Louis Warlimont (1857–1923) and Anna Rinck (1860–1931). His parents came from Eupen, today part of the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and migrated to Osnabrück. His father was a bookseller and antiquarian.
In 1927 Walter Warlimont married Anita von Kleydorff (1899–1987), daughter of Franz Egenieff (born Marian Eberhard Franz Emil von Kleydorff), a son of Prince Emil zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and US-born Paula Busch, a niece of Adolphus Busch.

His brother was head of a factory in Vienna which made components for the V-2 rocket, using forced labour from the Soviet Union.

In 1962, Warlimont wrote &quot;Inside Hitler&#x27;s Headquarters 1939–1945&quot;. He died in 1976 in Kreuth near the Tegernsee.

<text>Abu Salem ( ; born Abu Salem Abdul Qayoom Ansari), also known as Aqil Ahmed Azmi and Abu Samaan, is an Indian criminal gangster and terrorist from Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh, Central India. Abu Salem worked in the D-Company (Dawood Ibrahim gang) as a driver transporting artillery and contraband. Later he rose among the ranks after he introduced a new strategy of hiring unemployed youths from his hometown Azamgarh to come to Mumbai, execute shoot-outs and return the next day remaining untraced by the Mumbai police. He is currently serving a life sentence in India.

Salem is infamous for terrorizing the Bollywood film industry by extorting money from film producers and usurping the overseas distribution rights. It is believed that Salem was the mastermind behind threatening Bollywood film producers Gulshan Kumar, Subhash Ghai, Rajiv Rai and Rakesh Roshan. While his gang members assassinated Gulshan Kumar in 1997, they failed in their attempt to assassinate Rajiv Rai and Rakesh Roshan. He was also involved in several murders and extortion, among other crimes. He was later arrested in 2002 in Portugal on charges of using a fake passport and extradited to India. He was tried and convicted in some cases and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2015.

==Early life==
Abu Salem was born in 1969 (according to the CBI; although the Mumbai police says, 1962; some reports suggest 1968) into a lower-middle-class family in Sarai Mir village of Azamgarh district, Uttar Pradesh. He was the second youngest amongst four brothers, though some reports maintain that he was the eldest of four brothers. His father was a lawyer by profession who was killed in a road accident. He started a small mechanic shop in his home town to support his family. He studied in a primary school in Azamgarh and left the village after completing his inter college. He moved to Delhi, where he worked as a taxi driver. In 1985, he came to Bombay to earn a livelihood. He worked as a bread delivery boy between Bandra and Andheri and worked at a garment shop in Andheri West in 1986. Later, he became a real estate broker who operated from Arasa Market in Andheri West in 1987. In 1988, he assaulted a colleague over a monetary issue, resulting in the first case against him registered at Andheri police station. In the meantime, he married Samira Jumani from Jogeshwari, whom he divorced later. He has two sons from her. He loved film and reportedly named his sons after Bollywood actors. His elder brother Abu Hatim, also known as &quot;Chunchun Miyan&quot;, owns a shop in his native village.

==Involvement in organized crime==
In the 1980s, he started working for his cousin Akthar who had a cheap electronics shop near Andheri railway station. Akhtar also worked for Sayyed Topi, a Dawood Ibrahim gang leader in the Andheri area. Later Abu Salem started a travel agency at Santa Cruz with J K Ibrahim who worked for the Dawood gang. From 1989 to 1993, Salem worked as a driver for the D-Company (Dawood Ibrahim gang) and he delivered weapons, illegal cash and goods to different gang members in Bombay. His proficiency at delivering goods at the right time and place earned him the nickname Abu Samaan. In 1992, he supplied weapons to film actor Sanjay Dutt. He played an active role in March 1993 Bombay serial bomb blasts which killed over 250 people, left 700 injured and damaged property worth Rs 270 million. In 1993, he left the country and moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates when the police started rounding up suspects in serial blasts case. He had a business establishment there called Kings of Car Trading.

In the mid-nineties, many sharp shooters from D-company were killed either by the Chhota Rajan gang or in police encounters.
Salem successfully introduced a new strategy of hiring unemployed Muslim youths from his hometown Azamgarh to come to Mumbai, carry off the shooting and return to Azamgarh the next day. Those youths were paid a paltry sum compared to sharp shooters and the Mumbai police also could not track them as the youths had no criminal record with the Bombay police.
Soon Abu Salem got the support of Anees Ibrahim (Dawood&#x27;s brother) and he rose to prominence within the gang.
Because of his smooth talking skills, Salem was given the responsibility to manage the Bollywood deals and film financing for Dawood.

He organised stage shows where he invited actors. He was involved in extorting from the Hindi film industry, channelling illicit money into film production, forcibly getting the dates of stars, and usurping overseas rights. Salem first worked under Chhota Shakeel but later split and took to threatening film personalities for extortion. In mid-1997, reportedly went to Pakistan to make arrangements for the marriage of Dawood&#x27;s brother Humayun. Salem is believed to be the mastermind behind the murder of music baron Gulshan Kumar on 12 August 1997 without Dawood&#x27;s consent.

His gang members also attempted to shoot at Bollywood film directors, Rajiv Rai and Rakesh Roshan when they refused to yield to his extortion demands. Salem fled Dubai, fearing Dawood&#x27;s wrath. He finally parted ways with Dawood after being sidelined in 1998. His friction with Shakeel and Dawood&#x27;s favouring of Shakeel is believed to be the reason behind Salem&#x27;s split from the D-Company. In 2000, he planned kidnapping of Milton Plastics owner for ransom of Rs 30 million. In January 2001, his men shot Ajit Diwani, personal secretary to film actress Manisha Koirala. In October 2001, four members of his gang were shot in Bandra before they could target film personalities Aamir Khan, Ashutosh Gowarikar and Jhamu Sughand. In July 2002, two shooters of Salem&#x27;s gang opened fire on film director Lawrence D&#x27;souza who survived. He also attempted to kill cine figures Rajiv Rai, Rakesh Roshan and Manmohan Shetty.

==Arrest, extradition and trial==
He was convicted for the 1993 Bombay serial blasts case, and murder of music baron Gulshan Kumar in 1996, shooting at Indian actress Manisha&#x27;s secretary, murdering a property builder and more than 50 other cases.

On 20 September 2002, he was arrested along with Monica Bedi by Interpol in Lisbon, Portugal. His satellite phone was tracked using GPS technology. Monica Bedi was a film actress who reportedly had relationship with him. In February 2004, a Portugal court cleared his extradition to India to face trial in the 1993 Bombay bomb blasts case. In November 2005, Portuguese authorities handed him over to India on the assurance by the Government of India that the death penalty would not be handed out. When Salem was in Lisbon fighting India&#x27;s extradition attempt, the only proof that he was indeed Salem was provided by the fingerprint and photographs taken after his arrest in 1991. Monica Bedi was also extradited to India and later convicted of passport forgery in 2006 and served her imprisonment but she was not involved in any of the businesses operated by Abu Salem.

A lower court in Portugal cancelled his extradition to India for violation of deportation rules by Indian authorities by instituting fresh cases against him that attracted the death penalty. In July 2012, the Portuguese Supreme Court of Justice
questioned the legal right of Indian authorities to challenge the cancellation of extradition order.

On 27 June 2013, Salem was shot by Devendra Jagtap, an accused person in the Shahid Azmi murder case inside Taloja Central Jail in neighbouring Navi Mumbai, the police said. Salem sustained injury to his hand as Jagtap fired one round.

Abu Salem was convicted in Pradeep Jain murder case on 16 February 2015. Jain, a city-based builder, was shot dead outside his Juhu bungalow on 7 March 1995. Nameem Khan, an accused in the case had turned approver. Riyaz Siddiqui, another accused in the case had turned approver then retracted and is being tried separately. He was sentenced life imprisonment in Pradeep Jain murder case on 25 February 2015.

Abu Salem, Mustafa Dossa, and 4 others were convicted by a Special CBI court in Mumbai on 16 June 2017 in connection with the 1993 Bombay blasts case. Salem is currently lodged in Mumbai&#x27;s Arthur Road Jail. Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act Court Gives Life Imprisonment To Abu Salem in Mumbai 1993 Blast Case.

In 2010, a violent clash broke out between the gangster Abu Salem and Mustafa Dossa, which let to Salem&#x27;s face being slashed with a sharpened spoon.

On 7 June 2018, A Delhi court held him guilty for extorting Delhi businessman Ashok Gupta and sentenced him to seven years in prison. In 2002, Salem called Gupta asking him to call a number in Dubai. Salem had threatened Gupta and his family.

===Music Debut===
In August 2013, Punjabi singer Sukhwinder Singh Maan alias Sukha Delhi wala revealed that he would release a song composed by Abu Salem while lodged in Tihar Jail, in his next Music Album. The Music Album shall also feature many other celebrities like Rahul Mahajan and Vindu Dara Singh.

==Net worth==
Abu Salem is said to be a billionaire gangster worth Rs. 55 billion (Approx $0.67 billion). His cash and property have been valued at least Rs 10 billion, which is divided between him and his wife, Samira Jumani. While Salem stakes a claim to Rs 2 billion, his wife possess Rs 8 billion in cash and property. Salem&#x27;s investments in Bollywood and hawala rackets are estimated to be at least another Rs 30 billion. The CBI arrived at the figures on the basis of one-years transactions (2000–2001), and are said to be a conservative estimate.

Salem possessed a non-immigrant work visa in the US, where he was employed as a maintenance manager for a marine engineering company. As he operated under different names, he could buy property worth crores, despite his employment background. Preliminary calculations by the CBI reveal transactions worth Rs 2 billion were carried out by Salem in the year 2000 itself. Details of his earlier transactions were not known as his whereabouts are not known. Police sources say that his anonymous but legal businesses in the Middle East are run by his close associates.

==Personal life==
He married Samira Jumani, a 17-year-old college girl, in 1991 with whom he has a son. Samira currently lives in Duluth, Gwinnett County, Georgia, United States. Post Salem&#x27;s arrest in Portugal, she told interviewers that he was a &quot;violent psychotic man&quot; and she was forced into marriage.

In September 2002, Abu Salem and his partner Monica Bedi, were arrested and later served prison sentences in Portugal for entering the country on forged documents. In 2006, an Indian Court convicted Bedi for procuring a passport on a fictitious name. In November 2010, the Supreme Court of India upheld her conviction but reduced the prison sentence to the period that she had already served.

<doc id="587400" wikidata="Q3309774" url="?curid=587400" title="Ghatkopar">
<text>Ghatkopar (Pronunciation: ) is a suburb in eastern Mumbai, close to which, the City&#x27;s International Airport is located. The area is located on the Western corner of the Western Ghats and marks the beginning of the Ghats from Mumbai side. It is served by the railway station on the Central Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway and the metro station on Line 1 of the Mumbai Metro. The eastern part has a large Gujarati population.

==History==
Ghatkopar in the 1920s was a village ringed by creeks and salt pans. It was administered by a municipal council led by a Collector of the Suburban District. It became part of Greater Bombay in 1945.

There are many interpretations to how Ghatkopar got its name. Some say it refers to the hill range tapering off at Thane, &quot;Ghat ke upar&quot;, which roughly means &quot;on top of hill&quot;. Others believe the name is derived from the Marathi word for &quot;corner&quot; of the Western Ghats- &quot;Kopara&quot;, therefore, Ghat-kopara.

The names given to roads in Ghatkopar offer an interesting peek into its recent history. It has roads like Nowrojee Lane for Nowrojee Sheth, Cama Lane after Lady Cama, Hingwala Lane after a family dealing with asafoetida. 

==Mumbai Metro Project==
The Versova-Andheri-Ghatkopar Metro corridor of the Mumbai Metro project is an 11.07 km long double line corridor on an elevated viaduct. The route uses Standard Gauge air-conditioned trains with 12 elevated stations. It has a carrying capacity of 60,000 persons per hour and the commuting time on the entire stretch is 21 minutes. The commute time between Versova and Ghatkopar was reduced by 70 minutes by this line. Metro started running successfully from July 2014.

<text>The University of Winnipeg (UWinnipeg, UW, or U of W) is a public research university in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It offers undergraduate programs in art, business, economics, education, science and applied health as well as graduate programs. UWinnipeg&#x27;s founding colleges were Manitoba College and Wesley College, which merged to form United College in 1938. The University of Winnipeg was established in 1967 when United College received its charter. 

The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was a link between the bodies to perform institutional leadership.

The university is a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC), the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU), the Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate (CUSID) and a member of U Sports.

==History==
The UW&#x27;s founding colleges were Manitoba College, 1871, and Wesley College, 1888, which merged to form United College in 1938. In 1967, United College received a charter and became the University of Winnipeg. George Creeford Browne (architect) &amp; S. Frank Peters designed Wesley Hall (1894–5), which is now part of the University of Winnipeg.

The University of Winnipeg was established on 1 July 1967 when United College received its charter. United College was formed in 1938 from the union of Manitoba College, founded in 1871, and Wesley College, founded in 1888. Originally affiliated with the University of Manitoba, United College received its charter in 1967 and became the University of Winnipeg.

==Campus==


The campus of The University of Winnipeg is made up of 23 buildings spreading over several full blocks of Downtown Winnipeg, located directly on Portage Avenue. Over the past decade, the campus has undergone over 10 new building construction or major renovation projects. Through its revitalization, the university has become an engine for downtown renewal and improvement.

The Rice Centre is the home of the university&#x27;s administration and student services.

The Buhler Centre was constructed to house the Faculty of Business and Economics, as well as PACE (Professional, Applied and Continuing Education), a division of the University of Winnipeg. The doors to the Buhler Centre opened September 2010. Designed by PSA+DPA+DIN collective a collaborative effort between Peter Sampson Architecture Studio inc, David Penner Architect, and DIN Projects. The Buhler Centre also houses the Plug In Institute of Contemporary Art and Stella&#x27;s Cafe on the main floor.

McFeetors Hall: Great-West Life Student Residence is a student dormitory. It was partially funded by Raymond L. McFeetors, Chairman of The Great West Life Assurance Company who donated $2.67 Million for a dormitory to be built on newly acquired property west of the campus. The money came from his personal resources and from Great West Life.

The Asper Centre for Theatre and Film provides facilities for theatre and media studies.

The Axworthy Health &amp; RecPlex opened in 2014. It offers a range of sport and recreation facilities.

Leatherdale Hall is a shared multi-use building that is mainly used by the collegiate.

Downtown Commons which is located on Colony Street is a 14-storey apartment complex that offers accommodation for students and others.

Wesley Hall is a stone-clad brick structure built in 1894–95 and is on the Registry of Historic Places of Canada. It is located on 515 Portage Ave. near Portage Place Mall.
The institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at the University of Winnipeg. Specifically at the convocation hall.

===Campus development===
Campus development, by the University of Winnipeg, is headed by The University of Winnipeg Renewal Corporation (UWCRC), &quot;a not-for-profit charitable corporation, spearheads and manages campus development.&quot; The UWCRC is a not-for-profit subsidiary of the University of Winnipeg and works to achieve environmental, social, economic and cultural sustainability. Their mandate is to &quot;apply [the UWCRC&#x27;s] values, skills, competencies, and experience to non-University specific economic development activities. [UWCRC] is mandated to develop wholly owned or joint-venture real estate developments and to provide development, project management and property management services to other post-secondary institutions, non-profit organizations and First Nations clients.&quot;

The university president sits as the chair of the corporation and participates in its business partnerships.

The structure of the UWCRC is unique in Canada as it allows the corporation to avoid being governed by the strictures of university governance. The corporation serves as &quot;a primary engine for the redevelopment of Winnipeg&#x27;s downtown&quot;, a task traditionally undertaken by government and the private sector, and not educational institutions.

Recent initiatives include the newly renovated Asper Centre for Theater and Film, Richardson College for the Environment and Science Complex, The Axworthy Health and RecPlex, McFeetors Hall (a new student residence) and the UWSA Daycare. A new mixed use 14-story apartment complex for students and the community began construction in 2015.

<text>TEV &quot;Wahine&quot; was a twin-screw, turbo-electric, roll-on/roll-off passenger ferry. Ordered in 1964, the vessel was built by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, in Govan, Glasgow, Scotland for the Union Steam Ship Company&#x27;s Wellington-Lyttelton Steamer Express Service in New Zealand. 

The &quot;Wahine&quot; began transporting passengers on day and overnight trips on New Zealand&#x27;s inter-island route between the ports of Wellington and Lyttelton in 1966. The &quot;Wahine&quot; was permitted to carry a maximum of 1,100 passengers on day trips, or 927 berthed passengers on overnight trips.

On 10 April 1968, near the end of a routine northbound overnight crossing from Lyttelton, &quot;Wahine&quot; was caught in a fierce storm stirred by tropical cyclone Giselle. She ran aground on Barrett Reef, then drifted and capsized and sank in the shallow waters near Steeple Rock at the mouth of Wellington Harbour. Of the 734 people on board, 53 people died from drowning, exposure to the elements, or from injuries sustained in the hurried evacuation and abandonment of the stricken vessel.

The unfolding shipwreck drama was covered by radio and television crews, as the &quot;Wahine&quot; ran aground within a short distance of New Zealand&#x27;s capital city, Wellington. Newspaper crews, and other journalists and photographers, provided immediate news coverage documenting the passenger rescue and loss of life.

== Background ==
TEV &quot;Wahine&quot; was designed and built for the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, and was one of many ferries that have linked New Zealand&#x27;s North and South Islands. The first regular interisland ferry service between Wellington and Picton began in 1875, and the first Wellington – Lyttelton service began in 1895 with the Union Steamship Company vessel &quot;SS Penguin&quot;. Since then ferries have plied Cook Strait and the Kaikōura Coast, transporting passengers and cargo between Wellington in the north and Picton or Lyttelton in the south. From 1933 the Union Company&#x27;s Wellington – Lyttelton service was marketed as the &quot;Steamer Express&quot;. The introduction of &quot;Wahine&quot; in 1966 enabled the withdrawal of TEV &quot;Rangatira&quot; (1930–1967) from service in 1965 and TEV &quot;Hinemoa&quot; (1945–1971) in 1966 and the sale of both &quot;Rangatira&quot; and &quot;Hinemoa&quot; in 1967.

== Construction ==
&quot;Wahine&quot; was built by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Govan, Glasgow, Scotland. Plans were made by the Union Company in 1961, and her keel was laid on 14 September 1964 as Hull No. 830. Built of steel, her hull was completed in ten months, and she was christened and launched on 14 July 1965 by the Union Company&#x27;s director&#x27;s wife. &quot;Wahine&quot;&#x27;s machinery, cargo spaces and passenger accommodations were installed in the following months and she was completed in June 1966. She left Greenock, Scotland for New Zealand on 18 June 1966 and arrived at Wellington on 24 July 1966; she sailed on her maiden voyage to Lyttelton one week later, on 1 August.

&quot;Wahine&quot; was long, had a beam of and was . At the time &quot;Wahine&quot; was the Union Company&#x27;s largest ship and one of the world&#x27;s largest passenger ferries. The powerplant was turbo-electric transmission, with four boilers supplying steam to two turbo alternators that drove the twin main propellers and gave a top speed of . The ship also had stern and bow thruster propellers to propel her sideways for easier berthing. She had stabilisers that halved the frequency and amount she rolled.

The hull was divided by 13 watertight bulkheads into 14 watertight compartments. The lifeboat complement was eight large fibreglass lifeboats, two motor lifeboats each with a capacity of 50 people, six standard lifeboats each with a capacity of 99 people, and additionally 36 inflatable rafts, each with a capacity of 25 people.

== Service ==
&quot;Wahine&quot; entered service on 1 August 1966 with her first sailing from Wellington replacing TEV &quot;Hinemoa&quot; (1947–1967). Between then and the end of the year, she made 67 crossings to Lyttelton. From August 1966, TEV &quot;Wahine&quot; and TEV &quot;Maori&quot; (1953–1972) provided a two-ship regular overnight service between Wellington and Lyttelton, with one ship departing from each port each night and crossing during the night. The arrival of &quot;Wahine&quot; enabled &quot;Hinemoa&quot; to be withdrawn from service and subsequently sold. TEV &quot;Rangatira&quot; (1931–1965) had last sailed on 14 December 1965.

On a normal crossing &quot;Wahine&quot;&#x27;s crew complement was usually 126. In the deck department, the master, three officers, one radio operator and 19 sailors managed the overall operation, and in the engine department, eight engineers, two electricians, one donkeyman and 12 general workers supervised the operation of the engines. In the victualling department, 60 stewards, seven stewardesses, five cooks and four pursers catered to the needs of the passengers.

On trips made during the day &quot;Wahine&quot; could carry 1,100 passengers, and on overnight crossings 927, in over 300 single-, two-, three- and four-berth cabins, with two dormitory-style cabins each sleeping 12 passengers. Common areas included a cafeteria, lounge, smoke room, gift shop, two enclosed promenades and open decks. &quot;Wahine&quot; had two vehicle decks with a combined capacity for more than 200 cars.

== Disaster ==

On the evening of 9 April 1968, &quot;Wahine&quot; departed from Lyttelton for a routine overnight crossing to Wellington, carrying 610 passengers and 123 crew.

=== Weather conditions ===

In the early morning of Wednesday, 10 April, two violent storms merged over Wellington, creating a single extratropical cyclone that was the worst recorded in New Zealand&#x27;s history. Cyclone Giselle was heading south after causing much damage in the north of the North Island. It hit Wellington at the same time as another storm that had driven up the West Coast of the South Island from Antarctica. The winds in Wellington were the strongest ever recorded there. At one point, the wind reached and in one Wellington suburb the wind ripped off the roofs of 98 houses. Three ambulances and a truck were blown onto their sides when they tried to go into the area to rescue injured people.

As the storms hit Wellington Harbour, &quot;Wahine&quot; was making her way out of Cook Strait on the last leg of her journey. Although there had been weather warnings when she set out from Lyttelton, there was no indication that storms would be severe or any worse than those often experienced by vessels crossing Cook Strait.

=== Grounding ===
At 05:50, with winds gusting at between , Captain Hector Gordon Robertson decided to enter the harbour. Twenty minutes later the winds had increased to , and &quot;Wahine&quot; lost her radar. A huge wave pushed her off course and in line with Barrett Reef. Robertson was unable to turn the ship back on course, and decided to keep turning around and back out to sea.

For 30 minutes &quot;Wahine&quot; battled into the waves and wind, but by 06:10 she was not answering her helm and the engines had stopped responding. At 06:40, the ship was driven onto the southern tip of Barrett Reef, near the harbour entrance less than a mile from shore. She drifted along the reef, shearing off her starboard propeller and gouging a large hole in her hull on the starboard side of the stern, beneath the waterline. Passengers were told that the ferry was aground but that there was no immediate danger. They were directed to don their lifejackets and report to their muster stations as a routine &quot;precautionary measure&quot;.

The storm continued to grow more intense. The wind increased to over and &quot;Wahine&quot; dragged her anchors and drifted into the harbour. At about 11:00, close to the western shore at Seatoun, the anchors finally held. At about the same time the tug &quot;Tapuhi&quot; reached &quot;Wahine&quot; and tried to attach a line and bring her in tow, but after 10 minutes the line broke. Other attempts failed, but the deputy harbourmaster, Captain Galloway, managed to climb aboard from the pilot boat.

Throughout the morning, the danger of the ship sinking seemed to pass as the vessel&#x27;s location was in an area where the water depth did not exceed , and the crew&#x27;s worst-case scenario was the clean-up once the vessel either arrived in Wellington or had grounded in shallower water. There was indication that the ship would even sail again that evening as usual, albeit later than scheduled while the damage done by the reef was repaired.

=== &#x27;Abandon ship&#x27; and foundering ===
Around 13:15, the combined effect of the tide and the storm swung &quot;Wahine&quot; around, providing a patch of clear water sheltered from the wind. As she suddenly listed further and reached the point of no return, Robertson gave the order to abandon ship. In an instance similar to what had occurred during the sinking of the Italian passenger liner off the coast of New England in 1956, the severe starboard list left the four lifeboats on the port side useless: only the four on the starboard side could be launched. The first starboard motor lifeboat, boat S1, capsized shortly after being launched. Those aboard were thrown into the water, and many were drowned in the rough sea, including two children and several elderly passengers. Survivor Shirley Hick, remembered for losing two of her three children in the disaster, recalled this event vividly, as her three-year-old daughter Alma drowned in this lifeboat. Some managed to hold onto the overturned boat as it drifted across the harbour to the eastern shore, towards Eastbourne.

The three remaining standard lifeboats, which, according to a number of survivors, were severely overcrowded, did manage to reach shore. Lifeboat S2 reached Seatoun beach on the western side of the channel with about 70 passengers and crew, as did Lifeboat S4, which was severely overcrowded with over 100 people. Heavily overcrowded Lifeboat S3 landed on the beach near Eastbourne, about away on the opposite side of the channel.

&quot;Wahine&quot; launched her life rafts, but waves up to high capsized some of them and many people were killed. She sank in of water. forcing hundreds of passengers and crew into the rough sea. When the weather cleared, the sight of &quot;Wahine&quot; foundering in the harbour led many vessels to race to the scene, including the ferry , tugs, fishing boats, yachts and small personal craft. They rescued hundreds of people. Over 200 passengers and crew reached the rocky shore of the east side of the channel, south of Eastbourne. As this area was desolate and unpopulated, many survivors were exposed to the elements for several hours while rescue teams tried to navigate the gravel road along the shoreline. It was here that a number of bodies were recovered. At about 14:30, &quot;Wahine&quot; rolled completely onto her starboard side.

Some of the survivors reached the shore, only to die of exhaustion or exposure. Fifty-one people died at the time, and two more died later from their injuries, 53 victims in all. Most of the victims were middle-aged or elderly, but the toll included three children; victims dying from drowning, exposure or injuries from being battered on the rocks. Forty-six bodies were found; 566 passengers were safe, as were 110 crew, and six were missing.

== Disaster aftermath ==
=== Investigation ===
Ten weeks after the disaster, a court of inquiry found errors of judgement had been made, but stressed that the conditions at the time had been difficult and dangerous. The free surface effect caused &quot;Wahine&quot; to capsize due to a build-up of water on the vehicle deck, although several specialist advisers to the inquiry believed that she had grounded a second time, taking on more water below decks.

The report of the inquiry stated that more lives would almost certainly have been lost if the order to abandon ship had been given earlier or later. The storm was so strong that rescue craft would not have been able to help passengers any earlier than about midday. Charges were brought against &quot;Wahine&quot;&#x27;s officers but all were acquitted.

Early hopes that the ship could be salvaged were abandoned when the magnitude of structural damage became clear. As the wreck was a navigational hazard, preparations were made over the next year to refloat her and tow her into Cook Strait for scuttling. However a similar storm in 1969 broke up the wreck, and it was dismantled (partly by the &quot;Hikitia&quot; floating crane) where it lay.

=== Memorials ===
Wahine Memorial Park marks the disaster with a bow thruster, near where the survivors reached the shore at Seatoun. J. G. Churchill Park in Seatoun has a memorial plaque, the ship&#x27;s anchor and chain, and replica ventilators. A plaque and the foremast are at the parking area near Burdans Gate on the eastern side of the harbour, on the coast where many of the survivors and dead washed up. The main mast forms another memorial in Frank Kitts Park in central Wellington. The Wellington Museum has a permanent commemorative exhibition on its maritime floor that includes artifacts and a film about the storm and the sinking.

== Replacement ==
It was more than a year before the Union Company ordered a ferry to replace &quot;Wahine&quot;. In May 1969 it ordered , built by a different British shipyard and to a new design. She had accommodation for 159 fewer passengers, and like &quot;Wahine&quot; could carry more than 200 cars.

&quot;Rangatira&quot; did not enter service until March 1972, almost four years after &quot;Wahine&quot; was wrecked. She was a commercial failure, carrying on average only just over half the number of passengers and a third of the vehicles for which she had capacity. From 1974 the NZ Ministry of Transport subsidised the &quot;Steamer Express&quot;, but in 1976 it withdrew the subsidy and the service ceased.

<text>Tupelo Honey is the fifth studio album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It was released in October 1971 by Warner Bros. Records. Morrison had written all of the songs in Woodstock, New York, before his move to Marin County, California, except for &quot;You&#x27;re My Woman&quot;, which he wrote during the recording sessions. Recording began at the beginning of the second quarter of 1971 at Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco. Morrison moved to the Columbia Studios in May 1971 to complete the album.

The namesake for the album and its title track is a varietal honey produced from the flowers of the tupelo tree found in the Southeastern United States. The album features various musical genres, most prominently country, but also R&amp;B, soul, folk-rock and blue-eyed soul. The lyrics echo the domestic bliss portrayed on the album cover; they largely describe and celebrate the rural surroundings of Woodstock and Morrison&#x27;s family life with then-wife Janet &quot;Planet&quot; Rigsbee.

&quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; received most of its success in America; it charted at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and in 1977 it was certified gold by the RIAA. It failed to reach any of the European or other worldwide charts. The album yielded two hit singles, the hymn-like title track, and the R&amp;B-flavoured &quot;Wild Night&quot;. The third released single, &quot;(Straight to Your Heart) Like a Cannonball&quot;, was less successful and did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics at the time of its release, but Morrison&#x27;s biographers were less favourable towards it in later years.

== Background ==
Prior to the &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; recording sessions, Morrison had recorded demo tracks in Woodstock for an upcoming country music album. Some of the tracks planned for &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; did appear on the album, but other more traditional country songs like &quot;The Wild Side of Life&quot;, &quot;Crying Time&quot; and &quot;Banks of the Ohio&quot; were abandoned. Morrison decided to move from Woodstock when the lease on his house expired and the landlord wanted to move back in. He explained to Richard Williams in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; that the release of the 1970 film &quot;Woodstock&quot; about the Woodstock Festival had altered the quaint character of the community: &quot;Everybody and his uncle started showing up at the bus station, and that was the complete opposite of what it was supposed to be.&quot; In April 1971, before he began recording on the planned album, Morrison and his family moved to Marin County, California, where his wife, Janet Planet, had family living close by. Morrison&#x27;s guitarist at the time, John Platania, told biographer Steve Turner that Morrison &quot;didn&#x27;t want to leave, but Janet wanted to move out West. He was manipulated into going.&quot; The Morrisons&#x27; new home was in a rural setting situated on a hillside close to San Francisco amid redwood trees. With the move, Morrison abandoned the idea of a full country album and exchanged some of the intended material for songs he had written earlier.

Morrison was under pressure by Warner Bros. Records to produce chart singles and two albums within a year. His previous album, &quot;His Band and the Street Choir&quot;, had been released in November 1970. In an interview with journalist Sean O&#x27;Hagan in 1990, he described this period as being in contrast to the laid-back atmosphere pictured on the album cover: &quot;When I went to the West Coast these people [the musicians he had been working with in Woodstock] weren&#x27;t that available so I had to virtually put a completely new band together overnight to do [&quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;]. So it was a very tough period. I didn&#x27;t want to change my band but if I wanted to get into the studio I had to ring up and get somebody. That was the predicament I was in.&quot;

== Recording ==
Due to the location of the recording sessions of &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;, having moved from New York to California, the only musicians from Morrison&#x27;s previous band that could work with him were saxophonist Jack Schroer and his wife Ellen (who contributed backing vocals). However, two of the three percussionists on the album had recorded with him in the past; Connie Kay contributed drums to &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, and Gary Mallaber played drums and vibraphone on &quot;Moondance&quot;. On this album, Kay played drums on four songs, and new recruit Rick Shlosser was used for the remaining tracks, while Mallaber played percussion and vibraphone. Biographer Howard DeWitt was convinced that Morrison&#x27;s music benefited from his move to California, as he comments that &quot;the musical explosion in Marin County also added a great deal to Van&#x27;s music. In particular, Ronnie Montrose&#x27;s guitar work made &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; a rock classic.&quot; Mark Jordan and John McFee made up the rest of the rhythm section. The remaining members of the horn section were Bruce Royston and &quot;Boots&quot; Houston on flutes and Luis Gasca on trumpet. The band was augmented by producer Ted Templeman, who contributed organ to the title track.

The first recording sessions took place in the spring of 1971 at the Wally Heider Studios in San Francisco and continued for three weeks. Only four of the songs recorded were chosen for &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;: &quot;Wild Night&quot;; &quot;Moonshine Whiskey&quot;; &quot;I Wanna Roo You&quot; and &quot;Like a Cannonball&quot;. Rick Shlosser and John McFee played on these tracks, but were dropped from the second sessions. Engineer Stephen Barncard remembered that &quot;We&#x27;d get the band rehearsed, then Ted Templeman would go to the hotel, pick up Van ... We did one or two takes, he&#x27;d go back to the hotel and the band would go on to the next tune.&quot;

Morrison relocated in the late spring of 1971 to the Columbia Studios, San Francisco to record a second session of tracks for the album. This time Morrison rehearsed the songs before recording began, which helped the sessions run more smoothly. &quot;You&#x27;re My Woman&quot; was recorded a few days after the other songs, with Rick Shlosser back playing drums.

The vocals on the album were always live after rehearsing each song five or six times, according to saxophonist and flautist &quot;Boots&quot; Houston, who further commented that when Morrison and the band went into the studio: &quot;we would then just play a whole set straight through without repeating anything. We would have played maybe twenty songs and Van would go back and cut out the songs he didn&#x27;t want. The only time we&#x27;d go back would be to overdub backing vocals or horns.&quot; Ted Templeman remarked that he had to go through three engineers during the recording of the album, due to Morrison&#x27;s &quot;ability as a musician, arranger and producer&quot;: &quot;When he&#x27;s got something together, he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing ... I&#x27;ve had to change engineers who couldn&#x27;t keep up with him.&quot;

== Composition and themes ==
The rural setting in Marin County furnished the backdrop for the domestic bliss associated with the album, and the songs&#x27; lyrics contained harmonious references to the &quot;good life at home&quot;. In an interview given to &quot;New Spotlight&quot; magazine at the time, Morrison&#x27;s wife, Janet Planet, referred to Morrison&#x27;s dislike of socializing at this time: &quot;Really he is a recluse. He is quiet. We never go anywhere. We don&#x27;t go to parties. We never go out. We have an incredibly quiet life and going on the road is the only excitement we have.&quot; Although Morrison said that the songs on the album &quot;had been hanging around for awhile&quot; and according to biographer Steve Turner they were written in Woodstock, musician Ronnie Montrose recalled that Morrison wrote one of the tunes, &quot;You&#x27;re My Woman&quot;, while sitting at the piano during the recording sessions in California.

The album opens with &quot;Wild Night&quot;, a hybrid of R&amp;B, soul and country music influences, which uses a moderate time signature and features the lead guitar playing of Ronnie Montrose. The song&#x27;s intro was created, according to Montrose, when &quot;One afternoon I was messing around with what is now the intro on the record, [Van] stopped me and ... said &#x27; ... that thing you just played ... that&#x27;s the intro, don&#x27;t forget it. This guitar-driven intro in Clinton Heylin&#x27;s opinion made it one of Morrison&#x27;s most memorable singles. &quot;Wild Night&quot;, which has been described by biographer Ken Brooks as &quot;a great start to the album&quot;, was first recorded after the &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; sessions in Autumn 1968 and was re-recorded numerous times before its eventual release on &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;. Morrison recalled during an interview that the song was originally &quot;a much slower number, but when we got to fooling around with it in the studio, we ended up doing it in a faster tempo.&quot;

&quot;(Straight to Your Heart) Like a Cannonball&quot; combines a moderately swung waltz with blue-eyed soul. The song boasts a cheery guitar riff accompanied by acoustic guitars and flutes. Lyrically the song praises nature as an easy solution to the stresses of life, referring possibly to both Woodstock and Marin.

&quot;Old Old Woodstock&quot; is a tribute to Morrison&#x27;s previous life in upstate New York. The theme of domestic bliss is encapsulated in this song, as it shows a strong sensitivity towards children and family life. Howard Dewitt comments that &quot;It is a moving and compelling look at a satisfying period in Van&#x27;s life.&quot; Musically the song contains the music genres jazz and folk. Janet Planet served as the inspiration for the song and also performed backing vocals on the recording.

Jon Landau describes &quot;Starting a New Life&quot; as &quot;both the simplest and lyrically the most significant cut on the album as Van spells out with perfect clarity the statement of &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;: it expresses his need to take stock of himself, to see how far he has come, to record the support of those who have helped him get there, and together with them to &#x27;start a new life.

The last song that was recorded for the album was &quot;You&#x27;re My Woman&quot;. This slow, blues-influenced ballad was influenced by Janet Planet. As perhaps a last-minute decision Morrison added this song to the album in place of &quot;Listen to the Lion&quot;, just before it was released. The recording of &quot;Listen to the Lion&quot; was released a year later on &quot;Saint Dominic&#x27;s Preview&quot;.

The title song, &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;, is a classic love ballad in a vein established with &quot;Crazy Love&quot; from the album &quot;Moondance&quot;. Both songs have the same melody and chord progression, and are in time. &quot;Uncut&quot; reviewer David Cavanagh wrote: &quot;On an album where the vocals are exultant to say the least, this song sees Morrison use larynx, diaphragm, teeth and tongue to find new ways of enunciating the lines &#x27;she&#x27;s as sweet as Tupelo honey&#x27; and &#x27;she&#x27;s all right with me&#x27;, seemingly in ever-increasing adoration.&quot; Bob Dylan (who performed the song with Morrison during a concert tour in the 1990s) once remarked that Tupelo Honey&#x27; has always existed and that Morrison was merely the vessel and the earthly vehicle for it&quot;. Greil Marcus called the song &quot;a kind of odyssey&quot; evoking Elvis Presley (whose hometown was Tupelo, Mississippi), and &quot;the most gorgeous number on the album&quot; that &quot;was too good not to be true.&quot;

&quot;I Wanna Roo You (Scottish Derivative)&quot; is a country-flavoured waltz that prominently features John McFee&#x27;s steel guitar and Ronnie Montrose&#x27;s mandolin. The &quot;Scottish Derivative&quot; subtitle refers to the word &quot;roo&quot; featured in the song, which is a Scottish slang word for &quot;woo&quot;.

&quot;When That Evening Sun Goes Down&quot; is described by Erik Hage as a &quot;hootenanny flavored&quot; tune driven by &quot;barrel-house honkey-tonk piano&quot;. Like &quot;Wild Night&quot;, it was first recorded in Autumn 1968 and on various other recording sessions by Morrison before its release on &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;. An alternative take of the song was featured as the B-side of the &quot;Wild Night&quot; single.

The final song, &quot;Moonshine Whiskey&quot;, has been compared musically to the likes of the Band, (earlier in 1971 Morrison had worked with the Band in Woodstock). The song fluctuates between a slow and fast a time throughout. During the coda it accelerates to an abrupt ending. &quot;Moonshine Whiskey&quot; combines country rock and soul in a song that Morrison once spoke of as having been written for &quot;Janis Joplin or something.&quot; (Joplin lived in Woodstock around the same time as Morrison.) There is also a comic element to the song with Morrison imitating fish blowing bubbles.

== Packaging ==
The title of the album derives from the varietal honey produced from the flowers of the tupelo tree found predominantly in Florida.

The photos on the album were taken by Michael Maggid, a friend of Morrison&#x27;s then wife Janet Planet, in the town of Fairfax. The original LP was released in a gatefold sleeve. The cover photograph showed Planet, riding bareback on a horse, with Morrison walking alongside. The gatefold and back cover photographs showed Morrison perched upon the fence of the horse&#x27;s paddock, with his wife standing to his right and a black-and-white kitten on the fence to his left. This rural setting depicting a bygone era was in vogue on album covers at the time as rock artists moved from cities to rural communities. The Band, CSNY, and Grateful Dead had similar themes on album covers in 1969 and 1970. Morrison later complained of the cover, explaining that, &quot;The picture was taken at a stable and I didn&#x27;t live there. We just went there and took the picture and split. A lot of people seem to think that album covers are your life or something.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; was first released on LP in October 1971 on Warner Bros. Records. The album reached number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, which was the highest position reached in the US by any of Morrison&#x27;s albums at that point. However it failed to reach any of the charts across Europe. By the middle of 1974 &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; had sold well over 350,000 copies (50,000 more than &quot;Moondance&quot;), and in 1977 it was certified gold by the RIAA.

Three singles were released from the album. The first, &quot;Wild Night&quot;, with a rare alternative take on &quot;When That Evening Sun Goes Down&quot; as the B-side, proved popular enough to reach number 28 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single fared slightly better in The Netherlands, peaking at number 24. &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; reached number 47 on the US singles chart, with the B-side &quot;Starting a New Life&quot;. &quot;(Straight to Your Heart) Like a Cannonball&quot;, with &quot;Old Old Woodstock&quot; as the B-side, was the third single from the album and only reached number 119, just outside the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The album was reissued on CD in 1990 by Polydor Records. Another CD reissue was released in 1997 by Polydor and Mercury Records. The 29 January 2008 reissued and remastered version of the album, released on CD, contains an alternate extended (5:32) take of &quot;Wild Night&quot; and a reworked cover version of the traditional song &quot;Down by the Riverside&quot;. It was also reissued on vinyl, but without the bonus tracks.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; was well received by critics upon the album&#x27;s release. Jon Landau wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;Tupelo Honey is in one sense but another example of the artist making increased use of the album as the unit of communication as opposed to merely the song or the cut. Everything on it is perfectly integrated.&quot; &quot;ZigZag&quot; magazine reviewer John Tobler, who also reviewed the album just after its release, gave the album high praise, saying &quot;If all music were as good as this, there wouldn&#x27;t be any reason to make any more, because this is the real thing.&quot; Critic Dave Marsh called it &quot;the perfect album for Van: he does everything...so incredibly well. There isn&#x27;t a bad cut on it, of that I&#x27;m really sure.&quot; Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; voiced reservations in his praise of the album, writing that it was &quot;almost as rich in cute tunes as The Shirelles&#x27; &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, but I worry that domestic bliss with Janet Planet has been softening Van&#x27;s noodle more than the joy of cooking requires.&quot; &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; was later ranked the fourth best album of the year in the Village Voice&#x27;s first annual Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll.

Morrison&#x27;s biographers were less impressed by the album. Johnny Rogan commented: &quot;&quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; was no masterpiece but it was a considerable improvement upon &quot;His Band and the Street Choir&quot;. At a time when the rock élite were seduced by the lovelorn laments and steel guitars of country rock, Morrison emerged with a work that offered a soulful romantic veneer without lapsing into banal sentimentality.&quot; Erik Hage held the opinion that by this time Morrison had become famous enough to be insulated from constructive criticism, resulting in some of the love songs to Janet Planet on the album containing: &quot;obvious lyrical platitudes (truly some of his worst poetry since the revenge songs for Bang Records) and less-than-inspired arrangements.&quot;

It was ranked number 944 from votes taken in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; in 2000.

== Aftermath ==
In 2009, music journalist Erik Hage wrote that &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; &quot;has become one of Morrison&#x27;s most likeable albums, but the very elements that make it appealing to many—the homey feeling, the personal odes to married life—also make it a complacent album for an artist who had been pushing forward and challenging boundaries for the past few years.&quot;

Morrison was expected to tour to promote the album, but at this time he had developed a phobia about performing that was especially problematic when appearing before large audiences. John Platania was playing in concerts with Morrison and spoke of noticing his confidence ebbing away: &quot;There were many times when he literally had to be coaxed on stage. His motto was &#x27;The show does not have to go on&#x27;. He would create the choice of whether he would go on stage or not.&quot; Morrison announced before an impending performance at a larger venue that he was retiring from performing live. After regaining his confidence by making regular and informal performances at a small club near his home (the &quot;Lion&#x27;s Share&quot; in San Anselmo California), he began to tour coast-to-coast again in 1972.

=== Morrison&#x27;s response ===
Morrison said afterwards that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t very happy&quot; with it. &quot;It consisted of songs that were left over from before and that they&#x27;d finally gotten around to using. It wasn&#x27;t really fresh. It was a whole bunch of songs that had been hanging around for a while. I was really trying to make a country and western album.&quot; He commented further that he seldom listened to it and had a bad taste in his mouth for both &quot;His Band and the Street Choir&quot; and &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;.

<text>Tracy Chapman is the debut album by the American singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, released on April 5, 1988, by Elektra Records. The album was recorded at the Powertrax studio in Hollywood, California. In 1987, Chapman was discovered by fellow Tufts University student Brian Koppelman. He offered to show her work to his father, who owned a successful publishing company; however, she did not consider the offer to be serious. After multiple performances, however, Koppelman found a demo tape of her singing &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout a Revolution&quot;, which he promoted to radio stations, and she was eventually signed to Elektra.

In early attempts to produce the first album, many producers turned down Chapman as they did not favor her musical direction. David Kershenbaum, however, decided to produce it as he wanted to record an acoustic music album. It was recorded in Hollywood, California, in eight weeks. Most of the writing is based on political and social causes.

&quot;Tracy Chapman&quot; quickly gained critical acclaim from a wide majority of music critics, praising the simplicity, Chapman&#x27;s vocal ability and her political and social lyrical content. The album achieved commercial success in most of the countries it was released, making it to the top of the charts in many countries, including Austria, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland, Denmark and the United Kingdom. It peaked at No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), with sales exceeding over six million copies in the United States alone.

Three singles were released from the album, with the most successful single being &quot;Fast Car&quot;. The song was performed at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute. It rose to the top ten on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and also did well in Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. &quot;Tracy Chapman&quot; is one of the best-selling albums of all time, with sales of over 20 million units worldwide.

==Background==
In 1987, Chapman was discovered by fellow Tufts University student Brian Koppelman. In an interview, Koppelman said, &quot;I was helping organize a boycott protest against apartheid at school, and [someone] told me there was this great protest singer I should get to play at the rally.&quot; He went to see Chapman perform at a coffeehouse called Cappuccino, adding, &quot;Tracy walked onstage, and it was like an epiphany. Her presence, her voice, her songs, her sincerity—it all came across.&quot;

After this, Koppelman told Chapman that his father, Charles Koppelman, was at the time a co-owner of SBK Publishing and that he could help her make a record. She did not consider the offer seriously.

Koppelman was still very interested in Chapman, and he attended most of her shows. Chapman finally agreed to talk to him, but she did not record any demos for him. He later discovered that she had recorded demos at the Tufts&#x27; radio station WMFO for copyright purposes in exchange for the station&#x27;s right to play her music. Koppelman smuggled a demo tape of her song &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout a Revolution&quot; from the station, which he showed to his father.

According to the interview, &quot;He immediately got the picture and flew up to see her&quot;. Her demo led to her signing a contract with Elektra Records. Chapman said, &quot;I have to say that I never thought I would get a contract with a major record label [...] All the time since I was a kid listening to records and the radio, I didn&#x27;t think there was any indication that record people would find the kind of music that I did marketable. Especially when I was singing songs like &#x27;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout a Revolution&#x27; during the Seventies [...] I didn&#x27;t see a place for me there.&quot;

Producer David Kershenbaum said that the album was &quot;made for the right reasons,&quot; adding, &quot;There was a set of ideas that we wanted to communicate, and we felt if we were truthful and loyal to those ideas, then people would pick up on the emotion and the lyrical content that was there.&quot;

==Recording==
Chapman immediately started writing songs when she was signed to Elektra. Koppelman started finding producers for the album with the demo tape of her single &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout a Revolution&quot;. However, she was turned down, due to the popularity of dance-pop and synthpop at the time. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2008, Chapman stated, &quot;My first record was almost not my first record.&quot; After the originally chosen producer was killed in a car accident, Elektra initially selected a producer with less experience to replace him, and the recording sessions were, according to Chapman, &quot;horrible&quot; and &quot;bombastic&quot;.

They then found Kershenbaum, who later recalled, &quot;I&#x27;d been looking for something acoustic to do for some time,&quot; adding, &quot;There was a sense in the industry of a slight boredom with everything out there and that people might be willing to listen again to lyrics and to someone who made statements.&quot; Chapman&#x27;s greatest concern during her meetings with Kershenbaum was that the integrity of her songs remain intact, because she wanted to record &quot;real simple&quot;. Kershenbaum said, &quot;I wanted to make sure that she was in front, vocally and thematically, and that everything was built around her.&quot; Every song that was featured on the resultant studio album had been featured on her demo tape, except for &quot;Fast Car&quot;, which was one of the last songs recorded for the album. Kershenbaum recalled that the first time she sang and performed it for him, he &quot;loved it the minute I heard it.&quot;

The album was, in total, recorded in eight weeks at Powertrax, Kershenbaum&#x27;s Hollywood studio. Interviewed in 2002 by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Kershenbaum stated that a lot of the public wanted &quot;what she had&quot;, adding, &quot;And they weren&#x27;t getting it. She got there at the right moment with stuff that was good.&quot; Chapman was also interviewed and talked about the background of the album, stating, &quot;The first record [&quot;Tracy Chapman&quot;] is seen as being more social commentary... more political. But I think that&#x27;s just all about perspective.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical===
According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Chapman &quot;caught everyone&#x27;s ear in the hair-metal late Eighties&quot; with the album. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; found &quot;Fast Car&quot; and &quot;Mountains o&#x27; Things&quot; very perceptive and Chapman an innately gifted singer but was disappointed by the presence of &quot;begged questions&quot; and &quot;naive left-folkie truisms&quot;, such as &quot;Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout a Revolution&quot; and &quot;Why&quot;: &quot;She&#x27;s too good for such condescension ... Get real, girl.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;Arriving with little fanfare in the spring of 1988, Tracy Chapman&#x27;s eponymous debut album became one of the key records of the Bush era, providing a touchstone for the entire PC movement while reviving the singer-songwriter tradition.&quot; According to Erlewine, &quot;the juxtaposition of contemporary themes and classic production precisely is what makes the album distinctive – it brings the traditions into the present.&quot; He highlighted the album as being the best in her entire discography.

===Commercial===
Over three weeks after its release, the album first reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for the week of April 30 at No. 122. The following week, it reached No. 77 and continued to slowly climb the charts until it reached No. 1 in the week of August 27. Her live televised performance at Wembley Stadium in June marked a shift in album sales. Prior to that performance, 250,000 copies had been sold. By June 22, it was awarded gold record status by the RIAA. By July 27, it was awarded platinum status, having sold 1,000,000 copies. Ultimately, it sold over 20 million copies worldwide and is one of the first albums by a female artist to have more than 10 million copies sold worldwide.

===Awards===
31st Annual Grammy Awards
==Legacy==
In 1989, the album was rated No. 10 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums of the 80s&quot;. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 261 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, No. 263 in a 2012 revised list, and No. 256 in a 2020 revised list.

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at No. 49 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;.

The album was critically acclaimed and helped to revive the singer-songwriter tradition.

&quot;Fast Car&quot; was later recorded by country music singer Luke Combs for his 2023 album &quot;Gettin&#x27; Old&quot;, from which it was released as the second single. Combs&#x27; rendition of the song reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country Airplay chart, making Chapman the first black woman to solely write a country number one. Additionally, it reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, higher than Chapman&#x27;s original version. Chapman and Combs subsequently performed the song together live at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles on February 4, 2024.

<text>The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack is the 1968 debut album by the English psychedelic rock and progressive rock group the Nice.

==Background==
Originally formed in the spring of 1967 as the live backing group to soul singer P. P. Arnold, The Nice quickly established an identity of their own. By August, they had split from Arnold and were receiving rave reviews for their live performances, which secured them a residency at The Marquee. Andrew Loog Oldham approached the group soon after and signed them to Immediate Records, where they were ushered into Olympic Studios that fall with Oldham&#x27;s insistence that they only record original material. According to O’List, Mick Jagger was originally planned to produce the album, but was unable to do so. Engineering duties were undertaken by Glyn Johns, who contributed echo effects to “Flower King Of Flies”, also sung by O’List.

==Songs and recording==

The album was primarily composed of psychedelic pop typical of the period (&quot;Flower King of Flies&quot;,&quot; Tantalising Maggie&quot;, &quot;The Cry of Eugene&quot;), with Keith Emerson contributing layers of keyboards (piano, organ, harpsichord) and occasionally adding in quotes from well-known classical pieces. There are also two lengthy acid-rock instrumental jams, &quot;Rondo&quot; and &quot;War And Peace&quot;, which point in the group&#x27;s future progressive rock direction; on these, Emerson incorporates glissandos, feedback, and pitch-bending into his Hammond organ solos as he did on stage, along with an innovative patchwork quilt of blues, jazz and classical motifs. 

At the 1967 Windsor Jazz &amp; Blues Festival, lead singer Jackson claimed the song &quot;Flower King of Flies&quot; was about Paul McCartney. &quot;The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack&quot; was used as incidental music for the 1968 children&#x27;s television drama &quot;The Tyrant King&quot;, directed by Mike Hodges and written by Trevor Preston for Thames Television, from the London Transport book by Aylmer Hall. The 6-part series also featured music by the Rolling Stones, the Moody Blues and Pink Floyd. The title track was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in November 1967 along with the non-LP B-side &quot;Azrial (Angel of Death)&quot;; while it received a positive review from the Daily Mail, it failed to chart. Because the group lacked a strong lead vocalist they frequently used echo and filter effects on their vocals, such as on &quot;Tantalising Maggie&quot;, while the heavily psychedelic &quot;Dawn&quot; features an eerie whispered vocal from Jackson against extensive stereo panning of both guitar and organ feedback. 

&quot;Rondo&quot; is based around an extended quote and re-harmonization of the Dave Brubeck Quartet&#x27;s &quot;Blue Rondo à la Turk&quot;, adapted from 9/8 to 4/4 time, while the organ solo includes a short excerpt from Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Toccata &amp; Fugue in D Minor&quot;. &quot;War and Peace&quot; also contains a quote from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G Major&quot;, which would be more fully developed on the following album&#x27;s &quot;Brandenburger&quot;. &quot;The Cry of Eugene&quot;, which was later re-recorded by Jackson&#x27;s group Jackson Heights, refers to &quot;Harlequin &amp; Columbine&quot; and features trumpet work from guitarist Davy O&#x27;List. This would be the only Nice album to feature O&#x27;List.

==Title and album cover==

The name Emerlist Davjack is a portmanteau created by combining the last names of the four members of the group; Keith &quot;Emer&quot;son, David O&quot;&#x27;List&quot;, Brian &quot;Dav&quot;ison and Lee &quot;Jack&quot;son. The original disc credits all compositions to &quot;Emerlist Davjack&quot;; later releases give more specific credits. The first half of the title (&quot;the thoughts of&quot;) is apparently a reference to bassist Lee Jackson&#x27;s habit of carrying a copy of Mao Zedong&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Book&quot;, an alternate name of which was &quot;Thoughts of Chairman Mao.&quot;

The cover, photographed by Gered Mankowitz at a Soho studio, shows members of the band shirtless and wrapped in cellophane. According to Emerson, the back cover was to feature slides of the band superimposed over a woman&#x27;s naked body, although his embarrassment over it caused a less controversial (though still distorted) band photo to be used. 

==Release and reception==
The album was released in March 1968 in mono and stereo editions, promoted by a sampler (featured on the Castle Communications 2000 box set &quot;Here Come The Nice&quot; (CMETD 055-1)) featuring a commentary by DJ John Peel, which included the following comments:
1967 was a strange year for pop music with groups experimenting with new sounds and bouncing on and off bandwagons with dizzying speed and agility. They were calling themselves ridiculous names and regretting it shortly. The Nice came together in a void and will be here when the others are in pantomime in Wolverhampton.
The album received largely positive reviews, although it failed to chart. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; opined that the album &quot;successfully captures the musical ingredients that make them so rewarding live&quot;, noting interesting experiments in electronic and percussive effects. In the US, &quot;Cash Box&quot; noted that &quot;Rondo&quot; &quot;starts cookin&#x27; early&quot; and also named &quot;The Flower King of Flies&quot; and &quot;The Cry of Eugene&quot; as highlights, calling it a &quot;candidate for plenty of sales action.&quot; A retrospective review by AllMusic&#x27;s Bruce Eder is mixed, as he calls it a &quot;flawed but valiant effort&quot; with strong instrumental work that is let down by the lack of a real lead singer. 

Alternate mixes of six of the album&#x27;s songs would be included on the 1972 compilation Autumn &#x27;67 - Spring &#x27;68, with longer running times on several. 

==Legacy==
The album was named as one of &quot;Classic Rock&quot;&#x27;s &quot;50 Albums That Built Prog Rock&quot;. The adaptation of &quot;Rondo&quot; proved highly influential on many prog keyboardists to come, with Tony Banks noting that the Genesis song &quot;The Knife&quot; was based around a similar organ motif after seeing The Nice play it at The Marquee. &quot;Rondo&quot; would remain a signature piece and encore in Nice, ELP and Keith Emerson Band concerts until Emerson&#x27;s passing in 2016.

<text>Earthjustice (originally Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund) is a nonprofit public interest organization based in the United States dedicated to litigating environmental issues. Headquartered in San Francisco, they have an international program, a communications team, and a policy and legislation team in Washington, D.C., along with 14 regional offices across the United States.

The organization was founded in 1971 as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, though it was fully independent from the Sierra Club. The name was changed to Earthjustice in 1997. This was thought to better reflect its role as a legal advocate which represents hundreds of regional, national and international organizations. As of September 2018, the group has provided free legal representation to more than 1,000 clients ranging from the Sierra Club, World Wildlife Fund, American Lung Association, as well as smaller state and community groups, such as the Maine Lobstermen&#x27;s Association and the Friends of the Everglades.

Earthjustice is a nonprofit organization, meaning the legal service they provide is free for their clients. Funding for the organization comes from donations. It does not receive any funding from corporations or governments. In 2021, Earthjustice made $154 million in total revenue and $100 million in total expenditures. As of 2021, Earthjustice has full-time staff of about 170 attorneys in 14 offices across the United States, and 14 public-interest lobbyists based in Washington, D.C. They are involved in 630 active legal proceedings. The current president of Earthjustice is Abigail Dillen, an environmental attorney who first joined Earthjustice in 2000 and was previously Vice President of Litigation for Climate and Energy.

== Programs ==
Earthjustice&#x27;s work is divided into three key goal areas:
* The Wild – focus on cases in The Arctic to preserve the ecosystem from climate change and fossil fuel drilling; in the ocean ecosystem to protect from overfishing, pollution, and habitat loss; in the wild to preserve wild places and support biodiversity; and cases related to saving wildlife from extinction due to clear cutting, oil drilling, dams, dewatering streams, and climate change.
* Healthy Communities – focus on cases at both the regional and national level which protect against pollution and toxic chemicals. Earthjustice uses litigation to apply and enforce the Clean Air and the Clean Water Acts, and reform the toxics regulatory system.
* Clean Energy and a Stable Climate – focus on reducing the utilization of fossil fuels, eliminate barriers to, and create incentives for the use of renewable energy sources (such as through the Right To Zero campaign), and cases that promote ecological resiliency to withstand warming global temperatures. Through litigation, Earthjustice establishes and enforces national regulation for coal ash waste, retires old coal-fired power plants, prevents coal exports, and stops coal mining. Cases in this key area also focus on preventing fracking, preventing oil and gas drilling on public lands, strengthening environmental and health protections, and preventing fossil fuel infrastructure investments.

Earthjustice also partners with organizations from other regions, including Latin America, Russia, Japan, and China to promote the development of environmental law in their respective countries. Every year, Earthjustice submits a country-by-country report on Human Rights and the Environment to the United Nations.

== Impact on U.S. environmental law ==

Earthjustice has been a critical player in a number of important, precedent-setting cases regarding environmental protection in the United States.

In the 1972 Supreme Court case &quot;Sierra Club v. Morton&quot;, Earthjustice (then known as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund) helped establish the right of citizens to sue for environmental damages. The case ultimately forced the Walt Disney Company to drop its plans to develop an enormous ski resort in the Mineral King valley in California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada Range. The lawsuit blocked any further development or private use of the land which has since been incorporated into the Sequoia National Park.

In 1993, the organization (still then known as the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund) filed a lawsuit to block the development of the New World gold-silver-copper mine that was planned to be sited about four miles from the northeast entrance to Yellowstone National Park. The lawsuit was a victory in that the district judge ruled that not only could the subsidiary mining company (in this case Crown Butte Mines, Inc., a Montana company) who holds the mining claims and is developing the mine plan, but even the parent corporation (in this case Noranda Corporation, a Canadian company), could be held liable for violations of the Federal Clean Water Act (Ekey, 1997).

In 1998, Earthjustice helped local community groups convince the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to withdraw an approval to construct a uranium enrichment plant between two low-income, predominantly African-American communities near Homer, Louisiana. It was the first time a government agency had formally embraced the principle of &quot;environmental justice&quot; in its decision-making.

In the 2006 Supreme Court case &quot;Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency&quot;, Earthjustice attorneys helped a coalition of state governments and conservation groups force the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to fight global warming by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. It was the first Supreme Court case to ever address the issue of climate change.

Other suits have been less successful:

In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the US Navy in a suit brought in part by Earthjustice, which ordered Navy personnel to stop the use of certain types of sonar if a marine mammal such as a dolphin or whale was sighted within 2,200 yards. Among other details, the court noted that in 40 years of such sonar training there had not been a documented case of injury or death to a marine mammal that could be directly attributed to the sonar.

In 2017, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a suit against the EPA with the goal of banning the pesticide chlorpyrifos. The court ruled that an environmental coalition, including Earthjustice, failed to follow procedure by filing the suit with the court before filing their appeal of a 2007 EPA ruling allowing the pesticide. However, on August 9, 2018, the court ruled that chlorpyrifos must be banned within 60 days from that date

== Legislative positions ==
*Opposed Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of 2013 (H.R. 2279; 113th Congress), a bill that would &quot;amend laws concerning the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA&#x27;s) oversight of hazardous substances.&quot;

==Marketing==
In 2010, Earthjustice launched a fundraising campaign using the location-based social networking app Foursquare. The ad campaign, which ran in billboards in San Francisco&#x27;s BART system, gained national recognition as one of the first successful nonprofit uses of Foursquare. This success was featured in media outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Mashable, and &quot;MacLife&quot; magazine, as well as books such as Carmine Gallo&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Foursquare&quot;.

==Recognition==
In 2001, &quot;Worth&quot; magazine, aimed at high-income Americans, named Earthjustice as one of America&#x27;s 100 best charities.

Since April 1, 2009, Charity Navigator has given Earthjustice 4 stars, the oversight group&#x27;s highest rating.

In December 2014, the organization was recognized for its tagline &quot;Because the earth needs a good lawyer&quot;, which was chosen in a 2009 online contest as one of the best nonprofit taglines out of 1,702 entries.

Earthjustice has come under criticism for actions that are described as radical or counterproductive. Kevin Mooney of the right-leaning Capital Research Center writes that Earthjustice has represented a wide range of clients and causes, ranging from those well within the political and scientific mainstream to &quot;radical fringe groups with a reputation for outrageous claims and uncompromising positions.&quot;

Similarly, Fargo, North Dakota, columnist Rob Port has described Earthjustice as fundamentally &quot;obstructionist&quot; in their strategy against the Dakota Access Pipeline during 2016.

<text>USA Network is a Canadian discretionary specialty television channel owned by 2953285 Canada Inc., a joint venture between CTV Specialty Television, Inc. (consisting of Bell Media &amp; ESPN Inc. that owns 80%; with ESPN&#x27;s 20% ownership stemming from that subsidiary&#x27;s ownership of sister network TSN; ESPN is not believed to be involved in the operation of the channel) and Warner Bros. Discovery (which owns the remaining 20% via its holding company Discovery Communications, Inc.). Based on the U.S. channel of the same name, it primarily carries a general entertainment format focusing on television series, films, reality, and sports programming.

The channel was launched on December 31, 1994 by Labatt Communications as Discovery Channel, a Canadian version of the American cable network of the same name; as with its namesake, it primarily aired factual programming relating to topics such as science, technology, and nature, with a mix of original Canadian productions (including a daily news magazine that aired from its launch through 2018) and imported programming. By the 2010s, mirroring similar shifts by its U.S. parent, the network shifted to primarily airing reality-style programs, and later added reruns of scripted programming (particularly police procedurals) from other Bell Media channels. 

In June 2024, Rogers Sports &amp; Media announced that it had acquired the Canadian rights to all Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) factual and lifestyle brands beginning January 1, 2025, including Discovery Channel. Bell subsequently announced that it would enter into a licensing agreement with NBCUniversal for two of its Discovery-branded channels, with Discovery being relaunched as USA Network on January 1, 2025. A new iteration of Discovery owned by Rogers concurrently launched the same day. 

As a former Category A service, Discovery Channel was required to be carried on the basic service of all digital cable providers across Canada. The channel was, and still is as USA Network, typically offered optionally at the discretion of cable or satellite providers.

==History==
===Early years===

In October 1992, brewer John Labatt Ltd.—owner of TSN through its JLL Broadcast Group division, later renamed Labatt Communications—announced an agreement with Discovery Communications to apply to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a specialty television licence, to launch a Canadian service similar to the Discovery Channel in the United States. Under the agreement, Discovery Communications would supply up to 400 hours of programming per year to the Canadian channel.

Following hearings in February 1994, the channel was licensed by the CRTC that June, as part of a wave of new licences that included the specialty channels now known as CMT, CTV Drama, Slice, Showcase, and W Network. During the licensing process, the venture had received numerous letters of support from various science-focused and educational groups, and academics such as John Polanyi and Susan Mann. In its application, the channel promised a daily science-focused show, the first of its kind in North America, tentatively titled &quot;Canada Magazine&quot;.

The Discovery Channel launched in Canada on December 31, 1994, at 8 p.m. ET. The network was owned by Labatt Communications in partnership with Discovery Communications (which owned 20% of the venture), and was headed by former CBC executive Trina McQueen. Due to foreign ownership restrictions, Labatt Communications was later spun off and renamed NetStar Communications, as Labatt had been acquired by Interbrew. 

The channel initially carried 40% Canadian content and 60% foreign content, but committed to eventually airing a total of 60% Canadian content throughout the broadcast day, with 20% of its programming originated by Discovery Channel U.S., and the remaining 20% coming from other international producers. The proposed &quot;Canada Magazine&quot;, which debuted as &quot;@discovery.ca&quot; and was later retitled &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, was part of the channel&#x27;s launch schedule and ran until 2018. 

On March 24, 2000, the CRTC approved a proposal by CTV Inc. to acquire voting interest in NetStar Communications Inc. CTV renamed the company CTV Specialty Television Inc.

A high definition simulcast feed of Discovery Channel that broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format was launched on August 15, 2003. The feed would later be shut down on December 19, 2005, and be replaced by a separate category 2 digital cable specialty channel called Discovery HD Theatre.

In the late 2000s and early 2010s, the channel followed its U.S. counterpart&#x27;s shift away from natural history towards adventure and reality programming targeting male audiences, with series like &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;, &quot;Highway Thru Hell&quot;, and &quot;Canada&#x27;s Worst Driver&quot;.

Bell Globemedia was renamed to CTVglobemedia on January 1, 2007, after BCE Inc. reduced the stake to 15%. Bell Canada reacquired CTVgm in 2010 from The Woodbridge Company and renamed that division to Bell Media on April 1, 2011.

On June 17, 2011, Bell Media announced that it would launch, for a second time, an HD simulcast feed of Discovery Channel; this feed was launched on August 18, 2011.

=== Loss of Discovery rights, relaunch as USA (2024–25) ===
On June 10, 2024, Rogers Sports &amp; Media announced it had reached an agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for Canadian rights to its lifestyle brands beginning in January 2025. Although not mentioned in Rogers&#x27; initial announcement, the company subsequently confirmed that the affected channels include Discovery Channel and other brands of the former Discovery Communications (pre-Scripps Networks Interactive merger) which had been managed by Bell in Canada. Bell then said in a statement that it would &quot;assert [its] rights&quot;, citing non-compete protections it had previously negotiated against the launch of direct competitor channels. On June 19, Bell filed for an injunction against WBD and Rogers, demanding that it not supply any Discovery programming to Rogers for at least two years after its own deal expires, claiming it was entitled to a &quot;window to adjust&quot; under its outgoing contract in the event of non-renewal. 

According to Rogers, the injunction requested by Bell would—if granted—prevent the company from operating any linear TV channels under the relevant brands during that timeframe, but would not affect other content rights. Nevertheless, Rogers subsequently announced plans to launch its own linear specialty channels under the Discovery and Investigation Discovery brands on January 1, 2025 (alongside Food Network, HGTV, and Magnolia Network), with all other brands launched digitally via Citytv+. In late-August, Bell stated that it had dropped its legal action against Rogers (thus allowing its&#x27; relaunch of the Discovery brands to proceed), in favour of focusing on WBD having allegedly violated its right of first negotiation. On October 8, 2024, Bell settled with WBD, agreeing to a renewal of its library deals with HBO, Max, and Warner Bros. for its Crave service, as well as co-production and international distribution pacts for Bell Media original programming,

On October 17, Bell Media announced it would relaunch Discovery as a Canadian version of USA Network on January 1, 2025, as part of an agreement with Comcast&#x27;s NBCUniversal that would also see its version of Investigation Discovery relaunched under the similar Oxygen brand. The revamped channel carries a general entertainment format, with a focus on television series (including past and present USA Network original series such as &quot;Suits&quot;, and other new drama acquisitions such as &quot;The Pitt&quot;), films, and some live sports programming sublicensed from TSN.

USA and Oxygen will mark Bell&#x27;s second and third active channel partnerships with Comcast, following the relaunch of Star! as E! in 2010; Comcast and Bell Media&#x27;s predecessors were also co-owners of OLN from 1997 to 2008. In 2007, the CRTC rejected a request by Shaw Communications to add USA Network to the list of foreign television services eligible to be carried by Canadian television providers, on the basis that the channel carried too many programs already carried by other Canadian specialty services.

The CRTC lists Discovery Communications, Inc. (an in-name-only subsidiary of WBD) as holding a 20% stake in the CTV Speciality subsidiary that holds USA Network&#x27;s license; it is not yet known if WBD will divest its stake in the channel due to its change of Canadian partner.

==Programming==
In addition to shows acquired from its U.S. counterpart, the Canadian Discovery Channel produced much of its own original programming through its Exploration Production group including its former flagship daily science news program, &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, and its own domestic version of &quot;Cash Cab&quot;. Several programs produced by the Canadian Discovery Channel (such as &quot;How It&#x27;s Made&quot;) have also aired on the U.S. Science Channel.

Since 2015, enabled by that year&#x27;s retirement of CRTC genre protection rules which mandated that it predominantly air factual programming, Discovery began to make ventures into scripted entertainment programming with loose connections to history or scientific concepts. In November 2015, Bell Media announced Discovery Channel Canada&#x27;s first original scripted drama, the Jason Momoa-fronted Netflix co-production &quot;Frontier&quot;, chronicling the North American fur trade. In 2018, the channel began to devote portions of its schedule to reruns of police procedural series such as &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;,&quot; and &quot;NUMB3RS.&quot;

With the relaunch as USA Network, the network primarily airs general entertainment programming, including USA Network and Bell-owned library programs, films, and reality series (including factual series carried over from Discovery Channel such as &quot;Highway Thru Hell&quot; and &quot;Mayday&quot;, and competition series such as &quot;The Traitors&quot;). 

USA Network also carries some live sports programming sublicensed from TSN (since 2015, all discretionary specialty channels have operated under unified license terms that no longer restrict the genres of programming they may air, and allows channels not licensed as a mainstream sports channel to devote up to 10% of their programming to live professional sports), including professional wrestling from All Elite Wrestling (&quot;AEW Collision&quot;; USA Network has been the long-time cable home of AEW&#x27;s main competitor WWE, whose Canadian rights moved from Rogers&#x27; Sportsnet to Netflix in 2025 as part of a global licensing agreement), and coverage of the NASCAR Xfinity Series beginning in the 2025 season.

<text>Damocloids are a class of minor planets such as 5335 Damocles and 1996 PW that have Halley-type or long-period highly eccentric orbits typical of periodic comets such as Halley&#x27;s Comet, but without showing a cometary coma or tail. David Jewitt defines a damocloid as an object with a Jupiter Tisserand invariant (TJ) of 2 or less, while Akimasa Nakamura defines this group with the following orbital elements:
* q &lt; 5.2 AU, a &gt; 8.0 AU, and e &gt; 0.75,
* or alternatively, &quot;i&quot; &gt; 90°

However, this definition that does not focus on Jupiter excludes objects such as , , and .

Using the Tisserand&#x27;s parameter with respect to Jupiter of 2 or less, there are currently 220 damocloid candidates . Of these objects, 189 have orbital observation arcs greater than 30 days providing reasonably decent orbits. Their average radius is eight kilometers assuming an albedo of 0.04. The albedos of four damocloids have been measured, and they are among the darkest objects known in the Solar System. Damocloids are reddish in color, but not as red as many Kuiper-belt objects or centaurs. Other damocloids include: , , , , and 20461 Dioretsa.

Retrograde objects such as Halley&#x27;s Comet and damocloid 343158 Marsyas can have relative velocities to Earth of .

== Origin ==
Damocloids are thought to be nuclei of Halley-type comets that have lost all their volatile materials due to outgassing and become dormant. Such comets probably originate from the Oort cloud. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that a number of objects thought to be damocloids (and assigned minor-planet provisional designations) subsequently showed a coma and were confirmed to be comets: C/ (LONEOS), (LINEAR),  (LINEAR), (Spacewatch) and possibly others. Another strong indication of cometary origin is the fact that some damocloids have retrograde orbits, unlike any other minor planets. (Objects with an inclination beyond 90 degrees up to 180 degrees are in a retrograde orbit and orbit in the opposite direction of other objects.)

== List ==
 this list from the JPL SBDB contains 20 numbered and 268 unnumbered bodies that meet Akimasa Nakamura&#x27;s criteria for being classified as a damocloid, that is, either a retrograde orbit, or the following orbital elements: codice_1 &quot;(also see )&quot;. Tisserand&#x27;s parameter with respect to Jupiter (TJupiter) is also given. Akimasa Nakamura&#x27;s criteria and a TJupiter of less than two are largely equivalent as only a few listed bodies do not meet the defined TJupiter threshold. Most damocloids are also listed on MPC&#x27;s list of other unusual minor planets. The orbital data is sourced from JPL-numbered and -unnumbered element files. The list includes A/-designated objects (introduced in 2017) that were mistakenly identified as a comet, but are actually minor planets. However it excludes hyperbolic bodies such as A/2019 G4 as well as 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, two interstellar objects.

<text>Larisa Iosifovna Bogoraz (, full name: Larisa Iosifovna Bogoraz-Brukhman, Bogoraz was her father&#x27;s last name, Brukhman her mother&#x27;s, August 8, 1929 – April 6, 2004) was a dissident in the Soviet Union.

== Biography ==

Born in Kharkiv, at the time capital of the Ukrainian SSR, to a family of Communist Party bureaucrats, she graduated as a linguist from the University of Kharkiv and in 1950, married her first husband, Yuli Daniel, a writer. Together, they moved to Moscow.

Her marriage to Daniel would ultimately lead to her becoming involved in activism. In 1965, Daniel and a friend of his, Andrei Sinyavsky, were arrested for a number of writings that they had had published overseas under pseudonyms (see Sinyavsky-Daniel trial). The trial of the two men was the beginning of a crackdown on dissent under General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. They were both sent to terms in forced labor camps. After their detention, Bogoraz wrote to Brezhnev in protest, despite knowing that such an act could land her in prison.

In 1968, together with Pavel Litvinov, she prepared a letter addressed to the &quot;world community&quot; about the &quot;Trial of the Four&quot; (Yuri Galanskov, Alexander Ginzburg, Alexey Dobrovolsky, Vera Lashkova).

Bogoraz became well known when, on August 25, 1968, she organized seven people to protest in Red Square against the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Czechoslovakia at the 1968 Red Square demonstration, together with Pavel Litvinov, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Vadim Delaunay and other protesters. As all participants, Bogoraz was arrested, tried and sentenced to four years of exile in Siberia, which she spent in a woodworking plant. 

Daniel was released in 1970, while Bogoraz was still in Siberia. Their marriage did not survive much longer, and they soon divorced. However, soon after her release, Bogoraz resumed her resistance of the Soviet regime. She signed many public appeals to the authorities. She co-wrote an underground book, &quot;Memory&quot;, which detailed Stalin&#x27;s terror and was subsequently published overseas. She also contributed to the underground publication &quot;A Chronicle of Current Events&quot;. In 1975, she wrote a letter to Yuri Andropov, who was the head of the KGB at the time, requesting that he open the organization&#x27;s archives.

Bogoraz later married Anatoly Marchenko, another prominent dissident. Together, they co-wrote a number of appeals. Marchenko was arrested in 1980, and unlike Daniel, did not survive his sentence. Bogoraz launched a campaign in 1986 to have all political prisoners freed. The campaign was successful, as the following year, General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev began releasing them. This came too late for Marchenko, who died as a result of a hunger strike shortly before the initial release.

In 1987, she tried to initiate a campaign for amnesty for political prisoners.

In 1989, Bogoraz joined, and subsequently became chairwoman of, the newly re-founded Moscow Helsinki Group. She acted as a bridge between the old guard of dissidents, and the new generation that were arising as the Soviet Union dissolved.

After the demise of the Soviet Union, Bogoraz continued her activism, visiting prisoners and holding seminars on the defense of human rights. She also became chairwoman of the Seminar on Human Rights, a joint Russian-American nongovernmental organization. She resigned from the latter in 1996, but continued to exert influence in human rights circles up until her death.

Not long before her death, she issued an open letter condemning both the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the 2003 Iraq War. She died in Moscow on April 6, 2004, aged 74, after a series of strokes.

== Other ==

Bogoraz is mentioned in the song &quot;Ilyich&quot; (in Russian) by Yuliy Kim, available at several sites. That song is about the reaction of Brezhnev to the demonstration, and catches the spirit of the epoch of Brezhnev stagnation, although at the time of writing of the song, the text of the letter of Andropov to Central Committee was not available.

<doc id="587478" wikidata="Q7841226" url="?curid=587478" title="Triclavianism">
<text>Triclavianism is the belief that three nails were used to crucify Jesus Christ. The exact number of the Holy Nails has been a matter of speculation for centuries. Three nails are sometimes depicted as a symbolic reference to the Holy Trinity. In the early Church, &quot;two&quot; nails were posited by St. Ambrose (that is, omitting any in the feet); notably in Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;De obitu Theodosii&quot;. Nonnus of Panopolis, in his paraphrase of the Gospel of John, has the crowd cry for Jesus to be crucified upon “four spikes” (19:15) but eventually hung with only three, “a single nail … hammered into both his feet” (19:18).

==Etymology==

The words &quot;triclavian&quot; and &quot;Triclavianism&quot; were coined by Anglican scholar George Stanley Faber, in his work &quot;An Inquiry into the History and Theology of the Ancient Vallenses and Albigenses&quot; (1838). Faber employs the words in the process of claiming that Pope Innocent III had implicitly, but &quot;infallibly,&quot; endorsed the four-nail theory in 1209 through his endorsement of Francis of Assisi (1181–1226) — because in the last two years of his life Francis bore stigmata on his hands and feet which depicted four nailheads (not three). Faber calls Innocent&#x27;s foundation of the Franciscan Order &quot;a decision, which of course stamped the brand of heresy upon &quot;Triclavianism&quot;.&quot; Faber also refers to Francis as an &quot;impostor,&quot; suggesting that his argument here is not meant as any serious attempt to settle a question of Catholic theology. Further, there is no evidence Pope Innocent III made the number of nails a matter of orthodoxy/heresy. Nevertheless, Faber&#x27;s claim was picked up and repeated in other works, such as Sofia Bompiani&#x27;s &quot;A Short History of the Italian Waldenses&quot; (1899), in which Bompiani simply writes that Innocent had &quot;condemned&quot; triclavianism. Other scholarly treatments of the subject, such as Herbert Thurston&#x27;s article in the 1914 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, make no mention of Innocent III nor Francis.

George Stanley Faber&#x27;s 1838 account is as follows (emphasis in the original):

==Representation in art==
Though in the Middle Ages the crucifixion of Christ typically depicted four nails, beginning in the thirteenth century some Western art began to represent Christ on the cross with his feet placed one over the other and pierced with single nail. The poem &quot;Christus patiens&quot; attributed to St. Gregory Nazianzus and the writings of Nonnus and Socrates of Constantinople also speak of three nails.

The three nails, as a symbol for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, are also used on the coats of arms of Drahovce, Slovakia, Saint Saviour, Jersey, St. Clement Parish, Ottawa and in the seal of the Society of Jesus.

==Elsewhere==
According to Faber, Triclavianism was one of the beliefs of the Albigenses and Waldensians, who held that three nails were used to crucify Christ and that a Roman soldier pierced him with a spear on the left side.

The plant &quot;Passiflora edulis&quot; (passionfruit) was given the name by early European explorers because the flower&#x27;s complex structure and pattern reminded them of symbols associated with the passion of Christ. It was said that the flower contained the lashes received by Christ, the crown of thorns, the column, the five wounds and the three nails.

<text>A visual novel (VN) is a form of digital interactive fiction. Visual novels are often associated with the medium of video games, but are not always labeled as such themselves. They combine a textual narrative with static or animated illustrations and a varying degree of interactivity. The format is more rarely referred to as novel game, a retranscription of the &quot;wasei-eigo&quot; term , which is more often used in Japanese.

Visual novels originated in and are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006. In Japanese, a distinction is often made between visual novels (NVL, from &quot;novel&quot;), which consist primarily of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (AVG or ADV, from &quot;adventure&quot;), which incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside Japan, as both visual novels and adventure games are commonly referred to as &quot;visual novels&quot; by international fans.

Visual novels are rarely produced exclusively for dedicated video game consoles, but the more popular games have occasionally been ported from PC (or a hardware equivalent) to systems such as the Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, PlayStation Portable, or Xbox 360. The more famous visual novels are also often adapted into light novels, manga, or anime, and are sometimes succeeded or complemented by video games such as role-playing games or action games set in the same universe. The market for visual novels outside of East Asia is small, though a number of anime based on visual novels are popular among anime fans in the Western world; examples include &quot;Clannad&quot;, &quot;Danganronpa&quot;, &quot;Steins;Gate&quot;, and &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;.

==Structure==
Visual novels are distinguished from other game types by their generally minimal gameplay. Typically the majority of player interaction is limited to clicking to keep the text, graphics and sound moving as if they were turning a page (many recent games offer &quot;play&quot; or &quot;fast-forward&quot; toggles that make this unnecessary), while making narrative choices along the way. Another main characteristic of visual novels is their strong emphasis on the prose, as the narration in visual novels is delivered through text. This characteristic makes playing visual novels similar to reading a book.

Most visual novels have multiple storylines and more than one ending; the mechanic in these cases typically consists of intermittent multiple-choice decision points, where the player selects a direction in which to take the game. For example, in a dating simulator-themed visual novel, the player is prompted to pick different characters to date which, in turn, leads to a different ending. This style of gameplay is similar to story-driven interactive fiction, or the shorter and less detailed real-life gamebook books. 

Some visual novels do not limit themselves into merely interactive fictions, but also incorporate other elements into them. An example of this approach is &quot;Symphonic Rain&quot;, where the player is required to play a musical instrument of some sort, and attain a good score in order to advance. Usually such an element is related as a plot device in the game.

Fan-created novel games are reasonably popular; there are a number of free game engines and construction kits aimed at making them easy to construct, most notably NScripter, KiriKiri and Ren&#x27;Py.

Many visual novels use voice actors to provide voices for the non-player characters in the game. Often, the protagonist (that is, the player character) is left unvoiced, even when the rest of the characters are fully voiced. This choice is meant to aid the player in identifying with the protagonist and to avoid having to record large amounts of dialogue, as the main character typically has the most speaking lines due to the branching nature of visual novels.

===Narrative branches===
Non-linear branching storylines are a common trend in visual novels, which frequently use multiple branching storylines to achieve multiple different endings, allowing non-linear freedom of choice along the way, similar to a choose-your-own-adventure novel. Decision points within a visual novel often present players with the option of altering the course of events during the game, leading to many different possible outcomes. An acclaimed example is &quot;Zero Escape: Virtue&#x27;s Last Reward&quot;, where nearly every action and dialogue choice can lead to entirely new branching paths and endings. Each path only reveals certain aspects of the overall storyline and it is only after uncovering all the possible different paths and outcomes, through multiple playthroughs, that every component comes together to form a coherent, well-written story.

The digital medium in visual novels allow for significant improvements, such as being able to fully explore multiple aspects and perspectives of a story. Another improvement is having hidden decision points that are automatically determined based on the player&#x27;s past decisions. In &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, for example, the way the player character behaved towards non-player characters during the course of the game affects the way they react to the player character in later scenes, such as whether or not they choose to help in life-or-death situations. This would be far more difficult to track with physical books. More importantly, visual novels do not face the same length restrictions as a physical book. For example, the total word count of the English fan translation of &quot;Fate/stay night&quot;, taking all the branching paths into account, exceeds that of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by almost 80%. This significant increase in length allows visual novels to tell stories as long and complex as those often found in traditional novels, while still maintaining a branching path structure, and allowing them to focus on complex stories with mature themes and consistent plots in a way which &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; books were unable to do due to their physical limitations.

Many visual novels often revolve almost entirely around character interactions and dialogue choices usually featuring complex branching dialogues and often presenting the player&#x27;s possible responses word-for-word as the player character would say them. Such titles revolving around relationship-building, including visual novels as well as dating simulations, such as &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot;, and some role-playing video games, such as &quot;Persona&quot;, often give choices that have a different number of associated &quot;mood points&quot; that influence a player character&#x27;s relationship, and future conversations, with a non-player character. These games often feature a day-night cycle with a time scheduling system that provides context and relevance to character interactions, allowing players to choose when and if to interact with certain characters, which in turn influences their responses during later conversations.

It is not uncommon for visual novels to have morality systems. A well-known example is the 2005 title &quot;School Days&quot;, an animated visual novel that Kotaku describes as going well beyond the usual &quot;black and white choice systems&quot; (referring to video games such as &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, &quot;Fallout 3&quot; and &quot;BioShock&quot;) where you &quot;pick a side and stick with it&quot; while leaving &quot;the expansive middle area between unexplored&quot;. &quot;School Days&quot; instead encourages players to explore the grey, neutral middle-ground in order to view the more interesting, &quot;bad&quot; endings, e. g. an ending where a character dies or the main protagonist does not advance towards the flow of the story.

====Kinetic novels====

Kinetic novels are visual novels with non-branching plots, similar to a conventional novel or a graphic novel in multimedia form. Examples of kinetic novels include &quot;Higurashi When They Cry&quot;, &quot;Muv-Luv Alternative&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The term was first used by the publisher Key for their title &quot;&quot;.

===RPG hybrids===
There are role-playing video games that feature visual novel-style elements. A well-known example in the West is Mistwalker&#x27;s &quot;Lost Odyssey&quot;, an RPG that features a series of visual novel-style flashback sequences called &quot;A Thousand Years of Dreams&quot;. These sequences were penned by an award-winning Japanese short story writer, Kiyoshi Shigematsu. Another title is the Arc System Works fighting game series &quot;BlazBlue&quot;, which plays off of a complex fantasy setting where a one-hundred-year period is reset indefinitely with many variables. The many branching storylines in Story Mode can serve as stand-alone stories, but players must consider them together along with Arcade Mode stories to be able to fully understand the universe.

Another successful example is Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series, which combined tactical role-playing game combat with visual novel elements, introducing a real-time branching choice system where, during an event or conversation, the player must choose an action or dialogue choice within a time limit, or to not respond at all within that time. The player&#x27;s choice, or lack thereof, affects the player character&#x27;s relationship with other characters and in turn the characters&#x27; performance in battle, the direction of the storyline, and the ending. Later games in the series added several variations, including an action gauge that can be raised up or down depending on the situation, and a gauge that the player can manipulate using the analog stick depending on the situation. The success of &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; led to a wave of games that combine role-playing and visual novel elements, including &quot;Thousand Arms&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Luminous Arc&quot;.

==Style==

Despite using the narrative style of literature, visual novels have evolved a style somewhat different from print novels. In general, visual novels are more likely to be narrated in the first person than the third, and typically present events from the point of view of only one character.

In the typical visual novel, the graphics comprise a set of generic backgrounds (normally just one for each location in the game), with character superimposed onto these; the perspective is usually first-person, with the protagonist remaining unseen. At certain key moments in the plot, special &quot;event CG&quot; computer graphics are displayed instead; these are more detailed images, drawn specially for that scene rather than being composed from predefined elements, which often use more cinematic camera angles and include the protagonist. These event CGs can usually be viewed at any time once they have been &quot;unlocked&quot; by finding them in-game; this provides a motivation to replay the game and try making different decisions, as it is normally impossible to view all special events on a single play-through.

Up until the 1990s, the majority of visual novels utilized pixel art. This was particularly common on the NEC PC-9801 format, which showcased what is considered to be some of the best pixel art in the history of video games, with a popular example being &quot;Policenauts&quot; in 1994. There have also been visual novels that use live-action stills or video footage, such as several &quot;Sound Novel&quot; games by Chunsoft. The most successful example is &quot;Machi&quot;, one of the most celebrated games in Japan, where it was voted No. 5 in a 2006 &quot;Famitsu&quot; reader poll of top 100 games of all time. The game resembled a live-action television drama, but allowing players to explore multiple character perspectives and affect the outcomes. Another successful example is &quot;428: Shibuya Scramble&quot;, which received a perfect score of 40 out of 40 from &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine.

==History==

The history of visual novels dates back to &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot; (1983). It featured non-linear elements, which include traveling between different areas in a generally open world, a branching dialogue conversation system where the story develops through entering commands and receiving responses from other characters, and making choices that determine the dialogues and order of events as well as alternate outcomes, though there is only one true culprit while the others are red herrings. It also features a phone that could be used to dial any number to contact several non-player characters. The game was well received in Japan for its well-told storyline and surprising twist ending, and for allowing multiple ways to achieve objectives. Shortly after, in 1988, &quot;Snatcher&quot; appeared, developed by Hideo Kojima and released for the PC-8801 and MSX2 in 1988, in which a cyberpunk detective hunts down a serial killer. Another more non-linear early example was &quot;Mirrors&quot;, released by Soft Studio Wing for the PC-8801 and FM Towns computers in 1990; it featured a branching narrative, multiple endings, and audio CD music.

A common feature used in visual novels is having multiple protagonists giving different perspectives on the story. &quot;EVE Burst Error&quot; (1995), developed by Hiroyuki Kanno and C&#x27;s Ware, introduced a unique twist to the system by allowing the player to switch between both protagonists at any time during the game, instead of finishing one protagonist&#x27;s scenario before playing the other. &quot;EVE Burst Error&quot; often requires the player to have both protagonists co-operate with each other at various points during the game, with choices in one scenario affecting the other.

An important milestone in the history of visual novels was &quot;YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World&quot; (1996), which was developed by Hiroyuki Kanno and is ELF&#x27;s most famous visual novel. It featured non-linear storytelling, with a science fiction plot revolving around time travel and parallel universes. The player travels between parallel worlds using a Reflector device, which employs a limited number of stones to mark a certain position as a returning location, so that if the player decides to retrace their steps, they can go to an alternate universe to the time they have used a Reflector stone. The game also implemented an original system called Automatic Diverge Mapping System (ADMS), which displays a screen that the player can check at any time to see the direction in which they are heading along the branching plot lines.

&quot;YU-NO&quot; revolutionized the visual novel industry, particularly with its ADMS system. Audiences soon began demanding large-scope plotlines and musical scores of similar quality and ambition to that of &quot;YU-NO&quot;, and that responded by hiring talent. According to Gamasutra: &quot;The genre became an all-new arena for young artists and musicians once again, with companies willing to take chances on fresh blood; the market thrived with the excitement and the risks that were being taken, and became a hotbed of creativity&quot;. The branching timeline system was influential, opening &quot;the door for visual novels to become more elaborate and have a greater range of narrative arcs, without requiring the player to replay the game over and over again&quot;. According to &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, &quot;the modern visual novel genre would simply not exist without&quot; &quot;YU-NO&quot;. Branching timeline systems similar to &quot;YU-NO&quot; also later appeared in role-playing video games such as &quot;Radiant Historia&quot; (2010) and the PSP version of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; (2010).

Chunsoft sound novels such as &quot;Machi&quot; (1998) and &quot;428: Shibuya Scramble&quot; (2008) developed the multiple-perspective concept further. They allow the player to alternate between the perspectives of several or more different characters, making choices with one character that have consequences for other characters. &quot;428&quot; in particular features up to 85 different possible endings. Another popular visual novel featuring multiple perspectives is &quot;Fate/stay night&quot; (2004).

==Content and genres==

Many visual novels are centered on drama, particularly themes involving romance or family, but visual novels centered on science fiction, fantasy fiction, erotic fiction and horror fiction are not uncommon.

===Dōjinshi games (dōjin soft)===

Dōjinshi (, often transliterated as &quot;doujinshi&quot;) is the Japanese term for self-published (fan-made) works. This includes (but is not limited to) &quot;dōjin games&quot; (), also sometimes called &quot;dōjin soft (&quot;). These visual novel-style games are created as fan-made works based on pre-existing &quot;fandoms&quot; (usually anime and manga, but also for TV shows or even other pre-existing games and visual novels). Dōjinshi games are often based on romance (or &quot;shipping&quot;) between two characters, known as an &quot;otome game&quot; () or &quot;dating sim&quot;; sometimes becoming sexual (or &quot;hentai&quot;), known as an &quot;eroge&quot; (, a portmanteau of erotic game ()).

===Erotic content===

Many visual novels also qualify as eroge, an abbreviation of &#x27;erotic game&#x27;. These games feature sexually explicit imagery that is accessed by completing certain routes in the game, most often depicting the game&#x27;s protagonist having sex with one of the game&#x27;s other characters. Like other pornographic media in Japan, scenes depicting genitalia are censored in their original Japanese releases, only becoming uncensored if the game is licensed outside Japan with all art assets intact. Certain eroge titles receive re-releases which exclude explicit content in order to be sold to a younger audience, such as ports to consoles or handheld systems where sexually explicit content is not allowed, and storylines referring to aforementioned sex scenes are often omitted from adaptations into other media, unless that media is also pornographic in nature, such as a hentai anime.

Traditionally, PC-based visual novels have contained risque scenes even if the overall focus is not erotic (similar to the &quot;obligatory sex scene&quot; in Hollywood action films). However, the vast majority of console ports do not contain adult material, and a number of recent PC games have also been targeted at the all-age market; for example, all of Key&#x27;s titles come in censored versions, although the content might still not be appropriate for children, and three have never contained erotic content at all. Also, all of KID&#x27;s titles are made with general audiences in mind.

However, some of these games are later re-released with the addition of erotic scenes, or have a sequel with such. For example, &quot;Little Busters!&quot; was first released as an all-ages visual novel, but a version with erotic scenes titled &quot;Little Busters! Ecstasy&quot; came out later, and though &quot;Clannad&quot; is also all-ages, its spinoff &quot;Tomoyo After: It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; is not.

Often, the beginning of the eroge will be dedicated to introducing the characters and developing the protagonist&#x27;s relationship with them, before the protagonist sexually interacts with other characters, for example, Lump of Sugar games such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Everlasting Summer&quot; do this. The effect it has on the reader is the H-scenes (sex scenes) will have a stronger emotional impact for the two (or possibly more) characters.

Some of Japan&#x27;s earliest adventure games were erotic bishōjo games developed by Koei. In 1982, they released &quot;Night Life&quot;, the first commercial erotic computer game. It was a graphic adventure, with sexually explicit images. That same year, they released another erotic title, &quot;Danchi Tsuma no Yūwaku&quot; (&quot;Seduction of the Condominium Wife&quot;), which was an early adventure game with colour graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the NEC PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company. Other now-famous companies such as Enix, Square and Nihon Falcom also produced similar erotic games in the early 1980s before they became famous for their role-playing video games. While some early erotic games integrate the erotic content into a thoughtful and nuanced storylines, others often used it as a simplistic vehicle for fetishism, pleasure, an aid of the lightheaded themes that encourage stress relief or to portray nuances of sexuality. The Japanese game &quot;Pai Touch!&quot; involves the protagonist gaining the ability to change the size of girls&#x27; breasts, and the adventures that ensue in trying to choose which girl to use the power on the most.

Another subgenre is called , in which sexual gratification of the player is the main focus of the game.

===Science fiction===
In 1986, Square released the science fiction adventure game &quot;Suishō no Dragon&quot; for the NES console. The game featured several innovations, including the use of animation in many of the scenes rather than still images, and an interface resembling that of a point-and-click interface for a console, like &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot;, but making use of visual icons rather than text-based ones to represent various actions. Like the NES version of &quot;Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot;, it featured a cursor that could be moved around the screen using the D-pad to examine the scenery, though the cursor in &quot;Suishō no Dragon&quot; was also used to click on the action icons.

Hideo Kojima (of &quot;Metal Gear&quot; fame) was inspired by &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot; to enter the video game industry, and later produced his own adventure games. After completing the stealth game &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, his first graphic adventure was released by Konami the following year: &quot;Snatcher&quot; (1988), an ambitious cyberpunk detective novel, graphic adventure, that was highly regarded at the time for pushing the boundaries of video game storytelling, cinematic cut scenes, and mature content. It also featured a post-apocalyptic science fiction setting, an amnesiac protagonist, and some light gun shooter segments. It was praised for its graphics, soundtrack, high quality writing comparable to a novel, voice acting comparable to a film or radio drama, and in-game computer database with optional documents that flesh out the game world. The Sega CD version of &quot;Snatcher&quot; was for a long time the only major visual novel game to be released in America, where it, despite low sales, gained a cult following.

Following &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, Kojima produced his next graphic adventure, &quot;Policenauts&quot; (1994), a point-and-click adventure notable for being an early example of extensive voice recording in video games. It also featured a hard science fiction setting, a theme revolving around space exploration, a plot inspired by the ancient Japanese tale of &quot;Urashima Taro&quot;, and some occasional full-motion video cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to &quot;Snatcher&quot;, but with the addition of a point-and-click interface and some first-person shooter segments. &quot;Policenauts&quot; also introduced summary screens, which act to refresh the player&#x27;s memory of the plot upon reloading a saved game (save), an element Kojima would later use in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. The PlayStation version of &quot;Policenauts&quot; could also read the memory card and give some easter egg dialogues if a save file of Konami&#x27;s dating sim &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; is present, a technique Kojima would also later use in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. From 1997 to 1999, Kojima developed the three &quot;Tokimeki Memorial Drama Series&quot; titles, which were adaptations of &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; in a visual novel adventure game format. Other acclaimed examples of science fiction visual novels include ELF&#x27;s &quot;Yu-No&quot; (1996) and 5pb.&#x27;s &quot;Chaos;Head&quot; (2008) and &quot;Steins;Gate&quot; (2009).

===Nakige and utsuge===

Popular subgenres of visual novels include the , which still usually has a happy ending, and the , which may not. The genres are somewhat fluid and were largely pioneered in parallel during the late 1990s through the early 2000s by the works of Key co-founder, scenario writer, lyricist, and composer Jun Maeda; and through the works of through his affiliated company Âge, particularly Kimi ga Nozomu Eien and its successors, notably Muv-Luv. The ultimate goal of nakige and utsuge are emotional connection with the characters, through exploration of their personalities and evolving interrelationships through the drama of the game&#x27;s storyline, and to emotionally resonate with the player; repeated playthroughs across a rich cast of characters offers a multi-layered narrative. Games from publisher Key often follow a similar formula: a comedic first half, with a heart-warming romantic middle, followed by a tragic separation, and finally (though not always) an emotional reunion. This formula was influenced primarily by Hiroyuki Kanno&#x27;s &quot;YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World&quot; (1996) and Leaf&#x27;s &quot;To Heart&quot; (1997), and was further developed in &quot;&quot; (1998) by Tactics. After &quot;One&quot; was complete, the development team quit Tactics to form Key where they developed their first title &quot;Kanon&quot;, also based upon this formula. According to Satoshi Todome in his book, &quot;A History of Adult Games&quot;, &quot;Kanon&quot; was &quot;heavily hyped [and] had gamers impatient until its release. It was only one game released by Key so far, and yet [it] had already sent major shockwaves around the industry. And yet another game [&quot;Air&quot;], two years later, sent even more shockwaves. &quot;Air&quot; was equally hyped and well received.&quot;

Key&#x27;s &quot;crying game&quot; formula used successfully in &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Kanon&quot; was later adopted by other visual novel companies to create their own &quot;crying games&quot;. Examples of this include: &quot;&quot; (1999) by Digital Object, the &quot;Memories Off&quot; series (1999 onwards) by KID, &quot;D.C.: Da Capo&quot; (2002) by Circus, &quot;&quot; (2002) by Minori, and &quot;Snow&quot; (2003) by Studio Mebius (under Visual Art&#x27;s).

One of the most acclaimed visual novels of this subgenre was Key&#x27;s &quot;Clannad&quot;, written by Jun Maeda, Yūichi Suzumoto, and Kai and Tōya Okano. Released in 2004, its story revolved around the central theme of the value of having a family. It was voted the best bishōjo game of all time in a poll held by &quot;Dengeki G&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It served as the basis for a media franchise, with successful adaptations into a light novel, manga, animated film, and acclaimed anime series.

In 2008, several of Key&#x27;s visual novels were voted in the &quot;Dengeki&quot; poll of the ten most tear-inducing games of all time, including &quot;Clannad&quot; at No. 2, &quot;Kanon&quot; at No. 4, &quot;Air&quot; at No. 7, and &quot;Little Busters!&quot; at No. 10. In 2011, several visual novels were also voted in &quot;Famitsu&quot;&#x27;s poll of 20 most tear-inducing games of all time, with &quot;Clannad&quot; at No. 4, &quot;Steins;Gate&quot; at No. 6, &quot;Air&quot; at No. 7, &quot;Little Busters!&quot; at No. 10, and &quot;428: Shibuya Scramble&quot; at No. 14.

===Horror===
After developing &quot;The Portopia Serial Murder Case&quot;, Chunsoft released Otogiriso in 1992. Koichi Nakamura conceived the title after showing his work on the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; role-playing video games to a girl he was dating. On finding she did not enjoy them, he was encouraged to make a video game that he described as &quot;for people who haven&#x27;t played games before.&quot; Influenced by the early survival horror game &quot;Sweet Home&quot;, he developed it into a horror-themed interactive story. Chunsoft&#x27;s next release, &quot;Kamaitachi no Yoru&quot;, was also a best seller and would prove to be highly influential.

&quot;Higurashi no Naku Koro ni&quot; (&quot;When They Cry&quot;) was a 2002 horror-themed visual novel by 07th Expansion, influenced by the &quot;crying game&quot; subgenre. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion mentioned in 2004 how he was influenced by Key&#x27;s works and &quot;Tsukihime&quot; during the planning of &quot;Higurashi no Naku Koro ni&quot;. He played their games, as well as other visual novels, as a reference and analyzed them to try to determine why they were so popular. He decided that the secret was that the stories would start with ordinary, enjoyable days, but then a sudden event would occur leading the player to cry from shock. He used a similar model as the basis for &quot;Higurashi&quot; but instead of leading the player to cry, Ryukishi07 wanted to scare the player with the addition of horror elements. Other examples of horror-themed visual novels include: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Higanbana no Saku Yoru ni&quot;, &quot;Umineko no Naku Koro ni&quot;, &quot;Ookami Kakushi&quot;, &quot;Imabikisou, Saya no Uta&quot;, &quot;Doki Doki Literature Club!&quot;, and &quot;Corpse Party&quot;.

==Visual novels in the Western world==

Prior to the year 2000, few Japanese visual novels were translated into other languages. As with the visual novel genre in general, a majority of titles released for the PC have been eroge, with Hirameki&#x27;s now-discontinued AnimePlay series a notable exception. As of 2014, JAST USA and MangaGamer are the two most prolific publishers of translated visual novels for the PC; both primarily release eroge, but have begun to diversify into the all-ages market in recent years, with titles such as &quot;Steins;Gate&quot; and &quot;Higurashi no Naku Koro ni&quot; respectively. In addition to official commercial translations, a vibrant fan translation scene exists, which has translated many free visual novels (such as &quot;Narcissu&quot; and &quot;True Remembrance&quot;) and a few commercial works (such as &quot;Umineko no Naku Koro ni&quot; and &quot;Policenauts&quot;) into English. Fan translations of Japanese visual novels into languages other than English such as Chinese, French, German, and Russian are commonplace as well.

English translations of Japanese visual novels on video game consoles were rare until the release of the Nintendo DS, though some games with visual novel elements had been published in the Western world before then, such as Hideo Kojima&#x27;s &quot;Snatcher&quot;. Following the success of mystery titles for the Nintendo DS such as Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; series (which began on the Game Boy Advance in 2001), Cing&#x27;s &quot;Hotel Dusk&quot; series (beginning in 2006), and Level-5&#x27;s &quot;Professor Layton&quot; series (beginning in 2007), Japanese visual novels have been published in other countries more frequently. The success of these games has sparked a resurgence in the adventure game genre outside Japan.

GameSpot has credited &quot;Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney&quot; in particular for revitalizing the adventure game genre. The success of the &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; series was followed soon after by the even greater success of Level-5&#x27;s &quot;Professor Layton&quot; in 2007. Both have since become some of the best selling adventure game franchises, with &quot;Ace Attorney&quot; selling over 3.9 million units worldwide and &quot;Professor Layton&quot; selling over 9.5 million units worldwide by 2010. Their success has led to an increase in Japanese visual novels being localized for release outside Japan, including: KID&#x27;s &quot;Ever 17: The Out of Infinity&quot; (2002), Cing&#x27;s &quot;Another Code&quot; series (2005 onwards), Marvelous Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Lux-Pain&quot; (2008), Chunsoft&#x27;s &quot;999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors&quot; (2010), and Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective&quot; (2010). In more recent years, several modern Western narrative adventure games have drawn comparisons to visual novels, including Telltale Games titles such as &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; (2012), and Dontnod Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Life Is Strange&quot; (2015); the latter&#x27;s creative director cited visual novels such as &quot;Danganronpa&quot; (2010) as an influence.

Additionally, there have been some visual novels developed mainly in English, and intended for an English-speaking audience; one of the earliest commercially-available examples on a mainstream platform is 2004&#x27;s &quot;Sprung&quot;, and in more recent times, the availability of the genre has increased, with notable examples being &quot;Doki Doki Literature Club!&quot; and &quot;VA-11 HALL-A&quot;. Other languages have been the focus in visual novels, including Spanish, French, Russian and Mandarin, which have seen increased success due to the popularity of the genre.

<doc id="587507" wikidata="Q830324" url="?curid=587507" title="Best in Show (film)">
<text>Best in Show is a 2000 American mockumentary comedy film co-written by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy and directed by Guest. The film follows five entrants in a prestigious dog show as they travel to and compete at the show, and stars Guest and Levy alongside Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Michael Hitchcock, Jane Lynch, Michael McKean, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, and Parker Posey.

Much of the dialogue was improvised. Many of the comic actors were also involved in Guest&#x27;s other films, including &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;, &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;, &quot;For Your Consideration&quot;, and &quot;Mascots&quot;. The film&#x27;s score was composed by C. J. Vanston.

==Plot==
Five dogs and their owners, trainers and handlers travel to Philadelphia to compete in the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show.

Gerry and Cookie Fleck are a middle-class couple from Florida who arrive at the Taft Hotel with their Norwich terrier Winky. After having forgotten to pay their credit card bill and short of cash, they are forced to sleep in the hotel&#x27;s storage room. While traveling to the show, they encounter several of Cookie&#x27;s former lovers who try to seduce her again, much to Gerry&#x27;s chagrin.

Meg and Hamilton Swan, a stereotypical yuppie couple from a Chicago suburb, arrive with their weimaraner Beatrice. Their constant doting and neurotic behavior toward Beatrice—for example, taking her to a psychotherapist after she sees them having sex in a position they learned from the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;—confuses and upsets her.

Harlan Pepper, the affable Southern owner of a fishing goods store and an aspiring ventriloquist, arrives with his bloodhound Hubert. The Pepper family has raised a variety of hounds for generations; Harlan continues the tradition by raising bloodhounds.

Sherri Ann Cabot is the buxom, overly-made-up trophy wife of her elderly sugar daddy Leslie Ward Cabot. A former two-time winner of the show, Sherri Ann receives help with her standard poodle Rhapsody in White, also known as Butch, from her taskmaster trainer Christy Cummings. An extremely competitive butch lesbian, Christy rigorously trains Butch for the show and rejects Sherri Ann&#x27;s offers of a beauty makeover. Leslie is oblivious to Christy and Sherri Ann&#x27;s romantic involvement, as well as everything else happening around him.

Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof are a campy gay couple who take great pride in their Shih Tzu Miss Agnes and are confident that she will win the competition. They share a love of old movies and enjoy making fun of Christy Cummings, but are friendly to the other competitors, especially the Flecks.

The dog show is hosted by dog expert Trevor Beckwith and oblivious &quot;color&quot; commentator Buck Laughlin, whose inane banter is completely lost on Beckwith. During the first round, Beatrice is disqualified when she becomes aggressive and Hamilton cannot control her, which the Swans chalk up to a dog toy of Beatrice&#x27;s that they had lost prior to the show. The other four dogs advance to the final round. Just before the finals, Cookie dislocates her knee and insists that Gerry take over for her despite his two left feet (the result of a birth defect). Though Gerry is nervous, Winky ultimately takes Best in Show.

After the competition, Gerry and Cookie return home to Florida and enjoy brief fame there. While in a studio recording novelty songs about terriers, they discover that the recording engineer is yet another of Cookie&#x27;s ex-lovers, to Gerry&#x27;s unending frustration. Christy and Sherri Ann, now openly in a relationship (Leslie&#x27;s fate is unclear), publish &quot;American Bitch&quot;, a magazine for lesbian owners of purebred dogs. After spending weeks on a kibbutz, Harlan fulfills his dream of being a ventriloquist, entertaining sparse crowds with a honky tonk song-and-dance number. Stefan and Scott design a calendar featuring Shih Tzu dogs in costume appearing in scenes from classic films such as &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Meg and Hamilton are visibly happier together after replacing Beatrice with a pug named Kipper, whom they claim enjoys watching them make love.

===Dogs===
The starring dogs listed are denoted by their registered names. All have earned the title &quot;Ch.&quot;, indicating they have qualified for a championship at conformation shows, with most qualifying for the Canadian Kennel Club Championship—hence the prefix &quot;Can&quot;. The kennel prefix of one or more breeders precedes each dog&#x27;s registered name; e. g. in &quot;Arokat Echobar Take Me Dancing&quot;, the first breeder is &quot;Arokat&quot; and the second is &quot;Echobar&quot; while the name is &quot;Take Me Dancing&quot;. The registered name differs from the dog&#x27;s call name, which is used to talk to the animal. For example, Arokat Echobar Take Me Dancing&#x27;s call name is &quot;Peach&quot;.

* Can Ch. Arokat Echobar Take Me Dancing - Beatrice the Weimaraner
* Can Ch. Urchin&#x27;s Bryllo - Winky the Norwich Terrier
* Ch. Quiet Creek&#x27;s Stand By Me - Hubert the Bloodhound
* Can Ch. Rapture&#x27;s Classic - Miss Agnes the Shih Tzu
* Can Ch. Symarun&#x27;s Red Hot Kisses - Tyrone the Shih Tzu
* Can Ch. Exxel&#x27;s Dezi Duz It With Pizaz - Rhapsody in White (Butch) the Standard Poodle

==Production==
Filming took place in Vancouver and Los Angeles. In a 2000 interview, Christopher Guest reflected, &quot;Originally, we thought it would be easier to go to an actual dog show and film there, but nobody would let us do that.&quot; Eugene Levy adds that, &quot;We actually had to stage our own dog show. And that&#x27;s where the nightmare started. We literally had to put everything together from scratch, get somebody to organize the whole show, get the dogs in, find trainers and so forth.&quot;

The greater part of the film was improvised by the actors, with little to no planning. Sixty hours of footage were filmed, as was the case with Guest&#x27;s previous mockumentary &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;. Levy said, &quot;There is a much wider appeal for this movie than for &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;, which was a funny movie and a funny premise but not as accessible as this film, which is more mainstream. People just love dogs.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Best in Show&quot; received critical acclaim. The film has a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 115 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A fine example of writer/director/star Christopher Guest&#x27;s gift for improvisation comedy, &quot;Best in Show&quot; boasts an appealingly quirky premise and a brilliantly talented cast.&quot; The film also has a score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 33 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. It won American, British, and Canadian Comedy Awards. The film is number 38 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot;. A 2022 review of the best comedy films of the 21st century [sic] ranked this as first.

The film opened to a weekend gross of $413,436 to 13 theatres with an average of $31,802 per theater. After opening to a total of 497 theaters, the film ended its run with a domestic total of $18,715,392. The foreign gross of $2,074,164 brought its total gross revenue to $20,789,556.

==Legacy==
&quot;Best in Show&quot; was the inspiration for the broadcast of the National Dog Show, which has aired each Thanksgiving on NBC since 2002.

To celebrate Halloween 2022, former &quot;Victorious&quot; castmates Ariana Grande and Elizabeth Gillies paid homage to &quot;Best in Show&quot; by recreating several scenes from the movie in which they each dressed up as multiple characters. After shooting in May, the results were then posted to Instagram on October 28 and drew praise from Jennifer Coolidge.

<text>Joseph Sabine FRS ( ; 6 June 1770 – 24 January 1837) was an English lawyer, naturalist and writer on horticulture.

==Life and work==

Sabine was born into a prominent Anglo-Irish family in Tewin, Hertfordshire, the eldest son of Joseph Sabine. His younger brother was Sir Edward Sabine.

Sabine practised law until 1808, when he was appointed Inspector General of Taxes, a position he held until 1835. He had a lifelong interest in natural history and was an original fellow of the Linnean Society, elected on 7 November 1779.
Sabine was honorary secretary of the Royal Horticultural Society from 1810 to 1830 and treasurer, receiving their gold medal for organising the accounts left in a state of disarray by Richard Anthony Salisbury. The society&#x27;s gardens at Hammersmith, then Chiswick, were established under his guidance. He sent David Douglas and others to collect specimens, initiating local societies as extensions of the society. He contributed around forty papers for their &quot;Transactions&quot;, on garden flowers and vegetables. His management of the accounts led to large debts and after a threat of censure by a committee he resigned in 1830.

Sabine then focused on the position of secretary and vice-chairman of the Zoological Society of London, significantly increasing their collection of animals. He was a recognised authority on the moulting, migration and habit of British birds. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1799.

Edward Sabine was a member of John Ross&#x27;s Arctic voyage in 1818. He sent Joseph a specimen of a new gull which had been discovered during the expedition, which Joseph named Sabine&#x27;s gull (&quot;Larus sabini&quot;) in honour of his brother.

Sabine died in Mill Street, Hanover Square, London, on 24 Jan. 1837 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery on 1 February. There is a lithograph of him after a portrait by Eddis and his name was commemorated by de Candolle for a leguminous genus &quot;Sabinea&quot;.

<text>A is a type of Japanese garden ornament and music device. It consists of an upside down buried pot with a hole at the top. Water drips through the hole at the top onto a small pool of water inside of the pot, creating a pleasant splashing sound that rings inside of the pot similar to a bell or Japanese zither. It is usually built next to a traditional Japanese stone basin called &quot;chōzubachi&quot;, part of a &quot;tsukubai&quot; for washing hands before the Japanese tea ceremony.

==Traditional construction==
Constructing a is more difficult than it looks, because all components have to be finely tuned with each other to ensure a good sound. The most important piece of a is the jar, the upside down pot buried underground. Initially, jars that were readily available for storage of rice or water were utilized for the construction of a &#x27;. Both glazed and unglazed ceramic jars can be used. Recently, metal have also become commercially available. Unglazed jars are considered best, as the rough surface aids in the building of drops. The height ranges from 30 cm to 1 m, and the diameter from 30 cm to 50 cm. The hole at the top has a diameter of circa 2 cm. Similar to a bell, the jar of a good will ring when struck. A jar producing a good sound will create a good sounding &#x27;. Similarly, a cracked jar, like a cracked bell, will not produce a good sound.
The usually rests on a bed of gravel underground. The base underneath the jar is sometimes mortared to keep the water in, and sometimes consists only of soil as for example clay. The drainage pipe makes sure that the water level in the does not rise too high. Sometimes ceramic tiles are also used on the sides of the jar. Fist size stones are on top of the to cover the jar completely. Traditionally are always found near a hand wash basin &quot;chōzubachi&quot; used for the Japanese tea ceremony, and the is buried between the basin and the stepping stone next to the basin. The designs and materials used for a also vary widely, often depending on the local region.

Usually, only a single jar is buried underneath a Japanese stone basin. However, in some rare cases there may also be two adjacent to each other in front of the same &quot;. Such a double installation can be found for example in front of the Iwasaki Castle, Nisshin city, Aichi Prefecture, in the campus of the Takasaki Art Center College, Takasaki, Gunma prefecture, or in Kyoto University, Kyoto. However, having two openings about 50 cm apart means that it is difficult to cover the ergonomic best spot for washing hands with both openings. Thus, the creation of the sound is usually done intentionally by splashing water over the two designated spots, rather than accidentally by washing hands. with more than two jars may also be possible, such as for example three jars at the Shirotori garden in Nagoya.

==Modern variations==
There are a number of modern variations form the traditional &#x27;. the list below shows some of the possibilities for modern &#x27;.

*Modern are not always located next to a as traditionally required.
* can also be built with a continuous stream of water for a continuous sound instead of the and alteration (see below).
*Metal are also available nowadays.
*Some above ground devices similar to a have also been installed, for example as part of sculptures.
* are also installed indoors
*Commercial venues (restaurants, shops, and also offices) may have the sound of the indoor or outdoor amplified electronically and played through speakers.
*An additional pipe may also be installed to convey the sound from the cavity in the to another location, e.g. indoors.

==History==

Historically, were known as , but they were rarely used in Japanese gardens. It is believed that initially a vessel was buried upside down next to the washing basin in Japanese gardens to act as a drainage system. This sometimes produced pleasant sounds, and gardeners subsequently sought to improve the sound quality of the device. Their rise in popularity and the name originated from the middle of the Edo period (1603–1867), around the same time the stone basin was developed. The famous tea ceremony teacher Kobori Enshu of that time had a in his garden, and he is subsequently often credited as the inventor of &quot;. At the end of the Edo period, the creation of became less frequent, but became popular again during the Meiji Era (1867–1912).

At the beginning of the 20th century, i.e. the early Shōwa period, both the name and the device were all but forgotten, and a report of Professor Katsuzo Hirayama at the Tokyo University of Agriculture from 1959 could find only two in Japan, both of them inoperable and filled with earth. However, a journalist from the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot; wrote about in 1982, and requested information from the public about the topic. This led to a re-discovery of many &quot;&quot;, and a number of articles about in the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;. Shortly thereafter, in 1985, NHK aired a program about on Japanese television, and sparked a revival, with many new installed.

==Acoustics==
The sound of a has its own name in Japanese, called . The sounds can furthermore be divided in two sub groups, and . The is the sound of the first few water drops at the beginning of washing hands. The describes both the sound of a lot of water falling at the same time during washing hands and the slower drops at the end of the washing.

A superior has water drops originating from different spots on the surface of the jar. Unglazed jars hold moisture better, and therefore have drops originate from more spots on the surface. The impact of the water on the surface creates a sound, that is amplified by the design of the jar. Some do provide a bamboo tube nearby, which can amplify the sounds if one end is put on the ground near the top of the and the other end is placed on the ear.

It is said that every sounds different.

==Philosophy==
An important part of the idea behind the is that the device is hidden from view. Instead, the visitor washes his/her hands, and suddenly hears the pleasant sounds coming from underground. The act of washing the hands can also be considered as playing the &quot;&quot;, and the sounds emerge shortly after the washing. This clear sound of water drops is considered relaxing and soothing, and also described as beautiful and peaceful.

<doc id="587560" wikidata="Q765710" url="?curid=587560" title="Magnetic Island">
<text>Magnetic Island (Wulguru: &quot;Yunbenun&quot;) is an island offshore from the city of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. This mountainous island in Cleveland Bay has effectively become a suburb of Townsville. The island is accessible from Townsville Breakwater to Nelly Bay Harbour by ferry. There is a large National Park and bird sanctuary and walking tracks can be taken between the populated bays and to a number of tourist destinations such as the World War II forts.

The island is a holiday destination with many hotels and several resorts in operation to cater for all levels of service. The public facilities and infrastructure on the island are managed by the Townsville City Council. The island is part of the electoral district of Townsville in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, and part of the Federal seat of Herbert, which is represented by Phillip Thompson.

There are five settlements, namely Arcadia, Horseshoe Bay, Nelly Bay, Picnic Bay, and West Point. Geographic features include Rocky Bay, Picnic Bay and Hawkings Point, around its southern extremity, a bay, Nelly Bay to the east-north-east of Rocky Bay, followed by Geoffrey Bay, with Bremner Point as its northern arm. Horseshoe Bay is on the northern coast, and Cockle Bay Reef off the western coast.

In the , Magnetic Island had a population of 2,475 people.

== Naming ==
The Wulguru name for the island is &quot;Yunbenun&quot;. The first European accounts of the island come from Captain James Cook who, in 1770, while navigating the Australian coast, called the island &quot;Magnetical Island&quot;, as a magnetic pull interfering with his vessel&#x27;s compass appeared to emanate from the island. People have since explored the general area of Magnetic Island with various instruments to discover what might have caused the effect that Cook reported, but nothing has been discovered. Local names for the island are &quot;Maggie Isle&quot;, &quot;Maggie Island&quot;, or &quot;The Island&quot;.

==History==
===Pre-European settlement===

Yunbenun is the traditional land of the Wulgurukaba people. It had a transient population of Aboriginal people well before European exploration of the area. They had seasonal camps at a number of bays, and travelled between the island and mainland using canoes. A number of Aboriginal burial sites are said to exist on the island, but have so far not been identified. Aboriginal middens and cave drawings can still be found in a number of bays around Yunbenun. Folklore of the local Wulguru tribe recounts a long association with the island and annual migrations to the mainland to avoid expeditions of head-hunters from Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait, which used the northern trade winds to travel south along the Queensland coast. This head-hunting nearly ceased following the arrival of missionaries, led by Samuel MacFarlane to the Torres Straits in 1871.

===European settlement and development===

J.M. Black, funded by Robert Towns, founded the township of Townsville on the mainland nearby. As Townsville developed through the mid-19th century, Magnetic Island became a valuable location for the gathering of hoop pine and granite, the latter of which was used in the reclamation of land for the Port of Townsville, and for construction of Townsville&#x27;s Customs House.

Picnic Bay was named after its popularity as a picnic spot for European tourists from the mainland during the 19th century, before Magnetic Island was first inhabited by Europeans. In the mid-19th century the island became a popular location for the collection of stone and coral needed for development on the mainland. Even substantial quantities of gold were mined in 1886.

In 1875, the island was set aside as a quarantine station although it took another ten years for the proper facilities to be set up at West Point. In November 1884 the Queensland Government accepted a tender from Leisner and Sparre to construct the quarantine station for £3645. It was only after the tender was accepted that the site on West Point on the north-west was actually chosen.

In 1896 Cyclone Sigma tore across the island and through Townsville. At least 23 people died, many buildings destroyed and boats wrecked. The ketch &quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; was torn off its moorings and found later on Magnetic Island. (She was able to be recovered and continued to carry loads of timber up and down the coast, until being wrecked off the Queensland coast in 1899.)

By 1890 a resort had been started in Picnic Bay. In 1898 Robert Hayles Sr was so impressed by the potential of Magnetic Island he sold his other interests to build a resort on the island. Hayles was responsible for much of the development of Magnetic Island through tourism. In 1901 he started a regular ferry service to the island with his ship the &quot;Bee&quot;. Twelve months later this ship was wrecked on the rocks at Nobby Head, Picnic Bay, and the &quot;Phoenix&quot; was built by Hayles&#x27; sons to replace the vessel. The Hayles company remained operating services to Magnetic Island with a large number of different vessels until 1988.

===World War II===
Magnetic Island became an important defensive position during World War II because of its proximity to Townsville, an important military base, and its views over Cleveland Bay, a significant anchorage and assembly point for large fleets and convoys operating in the south Pacific. As such, the Magnetic Battery, &quot;(AKA The Forts)&quot; an artillery battery and observation post, was built in the hinterland of Florence, Horseshoe and Arthur Bays. Picnic Bay also became a popular defence force rest and relaxation camp following the commandeering of a resort in the bay in 1939.

===Post-war era===
The island slowly expanded following the end of the Second World War. In 1953, Centaur House, a memorial convalescent and rest hostel for nurses, was officially opened in Geoffrey Bay. 

In late December 1971 Cyclone Althea hit the North Queensland coast directly crossing Magnetic Island. The island, along with much of the mainland, was devastated with 90% of the island&#x27;s houses damaged or destroyed, some simply lifted off their foundations and tossed into trees. The island, along with the mainland, soon recovered.

In July 2012, a six hectare (15 acre) section of the island was granted to the Wulgurukaba Yunbenun Aboriginal Corporation under freehold title and a further 55 hectare (135 acre) section under a Deed of Grant in Trust.

===21st century===

In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Magnetic Island was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;Natural attraction&quot;.

==Demographics==

In the , Magnetic Island had a population of 2,107 people.

In the , Magnetic Island had a population of 2,199. 

In the , Magnetic Island had a population of 2,335 people.

In the , Magnetic Island had a population of 2,475 people.

==Geography==

Geographic features include Rocky Bay, Picnic Bay and Hawkings Point (around the settlement named Picnic Bay) around its southern point, a bay and settlement called Nelly Bay to the east-north-east, Horseshoe Bay on its northern coast, and Cockle Bay Reef off the western coast.

==Natural heritage and attractions==

The island is a haven for wildlife. 76% of the island is Magnetic Island National Park, which is mostly located on the steep hilly interior and rugged north-western side. The highest point on the island is Mount Cook reaching above sea level. A citizen science project at Magnetic has over 3500 observations of 1126 species with the most observed species the koala and the most observed marine species the goldstripe butterflyfish.

Magnetic Island is famous for its fishing opportunities. Fish around the island include: mackerel, giant trevally, queenfish, coral trout, blackspot tuskfish, tuna, fingermark, red emperor and sea perch.

As of 2013, there are over 800 koalas estimated to be present on the island; this population represents the northern limit of their geographic range.

The areas of the island that are not covered by the conservation area are open for development subject to local authority approval. As of 2018 the island was undergoing an economic boom.

The wreckage of SS &quot;City of Adelaide&quot; is located off the shore of Cockle Bay, the island and is a popular tourist attraction.

<text>The Portland Aerial Tram or OHSU Tram is an aerial tramway in Portland, Oregon, that connects the city&#x27;s South Waterfront district and the main Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) campus, located in the Marquam Hill neighborhood. It is one of only two commuter aerial tramways in the United States, the other being New York City&#x27;s Roosevelt Island Tramway. The tram travels a horizontal distance of and a vertical distance of in a ride that lasts three minutes.

The tram was jointly funded by OHSU, the City of Portland, and by South Waterfront property owners, with most of the funding coming from OHSU. It is owned by the city and operated by OHSU. While most passengers are affiliated with OHSU, it is open to the public and operated as part of Portland&#x27;s public transportation network that includes the Portland Streetcar, MAX Light Rail, and TriMet buses. After opening in December 2006, the tram carried its one millionth passenger on October 17, 2007 and its ten millionth rider on January 8, 2014. A round-trip ticket costs $8 but is free for OHSU patients and certain visitors; OHSU employees and students ride free by showing their ID badges.

The tram cost $57 million to build—a nearly fourfold increase over initial cost estimates, which was one of several sources of controversy concerning the project.

==Description==

===Route===

The tram consists of two stations and a single intermediate tower. Two tram cars operate in a pendular mode on parallel track ropes and are pulled in unison by a haul rope which is driven by an engine at the lower terminal; when one car is at the upper terminal, the other is at the lower terminal, and vice versa. The lower station is located beside an OHSU facility in the South Waterfront neighborhood, adjacent to a stop on the Portland Streetcar line, which connects the South Waterfront neighborhood with downtown Portland.
The upper station is located adjacent to OHSU Hospital, on the university&#x27;s Marquam Hill campus. The two stations are exactly east and west of each other separated by a horizontal distance of and a vertical distance of . The maximum vertical clearance between the tram and the ground is .

The tram route crosses over Interstate 5 as well as major thoroughfares such as Barbur Boulevard, Oregon Route 10 (Naito Parkway), and Oregon Route 43 (Macadam Avenue). The intermediate tower is located east of Interstate 5 close to the South Waterfront station. As a result of this configuration, much of the journey is significantly elevated above the ground, making the tram easily visible for some distance, and providing tram riders with good views of the eastern metropolitan area and the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and Washington. The alternative to riding the tram is via public roadways which require a route with numerous stoplights and intersections. This route includes a short stretch of busy U.S. Route 26, as well as twisty Sam Jackson Park Road which ascends the side of the Tualatin Mountains to the hospital campus.

===Structures and cabling===

The lower (South Waterfront) station houses the tram&#x27;s engines in a reinforced concrete basement and also has ticketing facilities and the control room.

The upper station is a freestanding steel and concrete tower above grade and houses the tram&#x27;s counterweight. It is structurally separate from nearby OHSU Hospital and connects to the hospital&#x27;s ninth floor via a skybridge over SW Campus Drive, which winds through the middle of the University. Structural separation between the tram and the hospital is necessary to avoid vibrations from tram machinery interfering with delicate microsurgery performed in the hospital.

The intermediate tower allows the tram to gain elevation quickly once leaving the lower station to provide adequate clearance over Interstate 5. The tower is wide and long at its base, at its narrowest point—nearly two-thirds up the tower—and at the top. It rests on a pier cap thick supported by 35 piers. The tower was fabricated in nearby Vancouver, Washington, and barged in three pieces up the Willamette River.

Nearly of steel and of concrete are in the two platforms and the intermediate tower; the lateral loads on the upper platform range from or .

Each tram car travels on a pair of steel track ropes, totaling four cables. The track ropes combined are tensioned at over . A fifth cable—the haul rope—is a continuous loop which winds around the drive bullwheel at the lower station, connects to one car, winds through a counterweighted bullwheel at the upper station, then to the other car, before joining itself. The haul rope length is over .

===Cars===

The tram cars each weigh approximately , with cabin dimensions of . Each car has a capacity of over and there is sufficient room in the cabin for 78 passengers and one operator. The tram cars were built by Gangloff AG, of Bern in Switzerland, and were shaped and painted to look like the architectural firm&#x27;s vision of &quot;bubbles floating through the sky&quot;. The surface of the cabins reflects and refracts light, minimizing their visual impact to the neighborhood underneath. The north and south cars are named &quot;Jean&quot; and &quot;Walt&quot;, respectively, after Jean Richardson, the first female engineering graduate from Oregon State University, and Walt Reynolds, the first African-American to graduate from OHSU, then known as the University of Oregon Medical School.

===Drive and safety systems===

The tram is propelled by three independent drive systems. The primary drive is a variable-frequency electric motor. Two hydrostatic diesel engines are also part of the design: one is a standby drive, permitting operation during a power outage; the other is an emergency evacuation drive. A counterweight offsets the weight of the cars. The tram is capable of operating at speeds up to 
In addition to the redundant drive system, the tram has numerous other design features intended to ensure the safety of passengers and persons on the ground under its route. Communications systems permit the tram car operators to communicate with the control room. Automatic supervisory and control systems monitor the condition of the ropes and the drive systems. The tram was designed to safely operate in the earthquake-prone Pacific Northwest, with a structural design exceeding U.S earthquake standards, and operate in sustained winds of up to .

===Operational information===
The tram operates from Monday through Friday from 5:30a.m. to 9:30p.m. and on Saturdays from 9:00a.m. to 5:00p.m., Pacific Time. The tram is closed on Sundays and major holidays, except afternoon summer Sunday service is available. The tram is free for OHSU employees, students, patients, and visitors. TriMet, C-Tran, and Portland Streetcar monthly and annual passes are honored. A ride on the tram normally lasts three minutes.

Transportation officials originally estimated the tram would carry over 1,500 people a day, a figure that was expected to rise to 5,500 by 2030. Those initial estimates proved to be conservative: the tram attracted one million riders in its first 10 months of operation, and averaged 10,000 riders per weekday as of 2016.

In March 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to the tram was indefinitely limited to employees of OHSU and affiliated institutions served by the tram and to patients. In May 2022, the tram reopened to the general public after temporary restrictions on access that ultimately lasted more than two years were lifted.

==History==

In late 2001, OHSU purchased property in the South Waterfront (then known as North Macadam) area, with plans to expand there. After studying several ways, including shuttle buses, gondola lifts, tunnels, and even funiculars, to connect OHSU&#x27;s primary campus on Marquam Hill with this area of planned expansion, the university sought city support of an aerial tram.

===Planning and design===
In early 2002, Portland Aerial Transportation, Inc. (PATI) was formed as a non-profit board. One of its first public actions was to request the Portland Bureau of Transportation (at the time known as the Portland Office of Transportation, and abbreviated as PDOTsic) to undertake an independent analysis of the connectivity options considered earlier by the university and its development supporters. In May 2002, the city council accepted PDOT&#x27;s process proposal and also accepted PATI as the project sponsor. PDOT&#x27;s assessment led to the same conclusion OHSU had reached earlier: an aerial tram was the preferred approach. PDOT also recommended a second tram linking the Marquam Hill area with a nearby transit center on SW Barbur Boulevard. In July 2002, the city council accepted PDOT&#x27;s recommendations and asked PDOT and PATI to proceed to the design phase, including a design competition. Both were also asked to work with residents of the affected neighborhoods to identify ways to mitigate the tram&#x27;s impact and identify other desired neighborhood improvements which should accompany the project. One of the results of that process was the Gibbs Street Pedestrian Bridge, which was completed mid-2012.

The design competition started out by identifying four firms which would participate in the contest. The competition officially began in January 2003, with firms from New York City, Amsterdam, and Los Angeles/Zürich as finalists. The winner, Angélil / Graham / Pfenninger / Scholl of Los Angeles/Zürich, was announced on March 26, 2003. In November, PATI chose Doppelmayr CTEC to design, fabricate and install the tram. The first public review of the project&#x27;s status was November 2003.

===Construction and opening===

Construction began in August 2005, with work on both platforms and the intermediate tower occurring through the summer of that year. The bulk of the construction occurred in 2006. Installation of the engines and other equipment occurred during the spring and early summer of 2006, which was followed by installation of the cables during the late summer and early fall.

On October 29, 2006, the tram&#x27;s two cars arrived from Switzerland after a week-long delay. An inaugural run of the tram was conducted on November 9, 2006. Four tram construction workers were the first to test ride the tram while harnessed to the roof and suspending arm. Testing on the tram continued through November. The tram opened to OHSU employees on December 15, 2006. The tram opened to the public on January 27, 2007.

=== Incidents ===
On December 4, 2018, a metal roof panel from one of the aerial tramway cabins came free and fell to the ground. The 35-square-foot panel fell an estimated 130 feet, struck a pedestrian below and caused minor injuries. After the incident, the Portland Bureau of Transportation commissioned a review of the incident. The review, and subsequent report, concluded that high winds dislodged the panel and that the existing latch and tether system failed to stop the panel from falling. In an effort to prevent future incidents, the engineering company designed a new permanent anchorage and safety tether system for the roof panels. Installation of this system was due to be complete by end of summer 2019.

==Funding and cost overruns==
The project suffered significant cost overruns during its construction. Final cost was nearly four times the initial estimate, a development that nearly led to the tram&#x27;s cancellation mid-construction. Operating costs are nearly twice original projections. When the city approved the tram project, it was understood that OHSU would pay for most of it. While the taxpayer share has grown, OHSU paid for 85% of the total cost of the tram though it is operated as public transit facility.

===Initial estimates and funding===
The initial budget for the tram, published in November 2002, was $15.5 million, excluding &quot;soft costs&quot; such as project management and architect&#x27;s fees. Funding sources for the $15.5 million include a direct $4 million cash contribution from OHSU, $9.5 from local improvement districts set up to fund tram construction, of which OHSU&#x27;s share is $4.8 million, and $2 million from the city of Portland, via the Portland Development Commission. Other property owners in the South Waterfront Local Improvement District pay the remaining $3.7 million.

In April 2004, the second public review was held to present project recommendations prior to a May review by the city council. The costs by then were estimated to be $28.5 million, including soft costs. The city&#x27;s share at that time was $3.5 million. In April 2005, the price was readjusted again to $40 million with a construction delay of six months. Higher steel costs, weakening US dollars, and engineering modifications were blamed. By October, &quot;The Oregonian&quot; reported that steel costs had led to bids pushing the project&#x27;s price (with contingency funds) to $45 million. The increased cost was expected to be met through South Waterfront urban renewal contributions which would have otherwise been spent on streets and parks.

===Review of the project===

In January 2006, Portland city commissioner Sam Adams, who inherited the city&#x27;s oversight of the project, undertook several actions in response to spiraling costs. The executive director of PATI was ousted, and a month-long independent audit and risk assessment was undertaken; its results were published February 1, 2006. By this point, construction was over one third completed.

The audit revealed that OHSU managers knew as early as 2003 that the tram would cost well in excess of the original $15.5 million figure, partially due to a change in location of the upper terminal to accommodate planned hospital construction, but had withheld that information from city leaders. This resulted in harsh public criticism of OHSU management, with city commissioner Randy Leonard accusing the university leadership of an &quot;outrageous shell game...all at the expense of taxpayers&quot;. As a result, the city of Portland threatened to withdraw funding from the tram mid-construction, which would probably have scuttled the project. OHSU protested vigorously, threatening a lawsuit should the tram be canceled, and claimed the city was responsible for making up any budget shortfall.
Negotiations between the city, OHSU, and the contractors ensued, with a revised funding plan and budget being agreed upon in April 2006, by a 3–2 vote of the city council. This revised funding plan required concessions from all parties involved, and called for a final budget of $57 million, with contributions from the city at $8.5 million, or nearly 15% of the overall budget. This final budget was met.

===Operating costs===
The tram&#x27;s operating costs are also higher than expected. Originally, it was expected to cost $915,000 annually, but is now expected to be $1.7 million. As a result, the fare—originally estimated at $1.70—is set at $8.50 (as of 2025), similar to the price of an all-day ticket on Tri-Met ($5.00). The fare is waived for OHSU employees, students, patients, and visitors. Operating costs are divided between the city and OHSU in proportion to the ridership. (If 85% of passengers are OHSU-related, OHSU pays 85% of the operating cost.)

==Community response==
Even prior to the cost increases which plagued the design and construction of the tram, the project has been subject to criticism from the public. Many residents in the neighborhoods under the tram&#x27;s route object to the tram&#x27;s presence. The cost increases themselves, and the perceived machinations of public officials, have been controversial.

===Objections from underlying neighborhoods===

Many residents of the Corbett-Terwilliger and Lair Hill neighborhoods, over which the tram passes, were concerned the cars would be an invasion of privacy and lead to lower property values. Initially, residents were promised that overhead power lines would be buried as part of the project, but as cost overruns mounted, this plan was scrapped. Neighborhood opponents of the tram have cited other reasons for opposing the tram&#x27;s construction, including the fact that the North Corbett neighborhood is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Some residents filed a lawsuit against the city and OHSU, claiming that they own the &quot;airspace&quot; above their properties. The city later offered to purchase homes directly under the tram route at fair market value.

In the initial years after its completion, the tram was unpopular with some living underneath its route. In April 2007, homeowner Justin Auld, living under the tram route, placed a sign on his backyard fence stating &quot;FUCK THE TRAM&quot; in large block letters. The sign is not visible from the street, only from the air. The publicity surrounding the sign prompted city officials to quietly negotiate with the homeowner, and the sign has since been moved and the expletive covered.

===Concerns over the cost===
Both OHSU and the city of Portland have taken much public criticism for ballooning development costs. Local television station KATU questioned the relative price of the Portland tram compared to a new tram at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, which was built by the same company, and (as of 2007) was projected to carry 28 percent more passengers, but costing only $25 million.

The tram&#x27;s supporters, however, claimed that many of the increases are justified, or due to circumstances beyond the developers&#x27; control. The auditor&#x27;s report, commissioned in 2006, complimented the tram as &quot;a dramatic, one-of-a-kind facility that will become a Portland landmark,&quot; and noted that the design was difficult to construct, requiring the tall, thin, complex tower and the tall, heavily loaded upper terminal to be built within very tight tolerances.

In addition, it has been claimed that the re-planning delayed the tram&#x27;s completion. One of the designers of the tram noted that &quot;if we added up all the times we went back to try to save money, we probably lost a year. Maybe we saved $2 million, but what did we lose? If we had an extra year, that would have meant a lot.&quot;

===Concerns over corporate welfare===

Some critics, at the time of construction, cited the tram as an example of corporate welfare for OHSU with limited public benefit. A 2001 study done by OHSU prior to the tram&#x27;s being designed projected that the tram would have 4,700 riders per day by 2030, with less than one fifth (850) of those being non-OHSU users. While the lower station has easy public access, access to the upper station requires navigating through the OHSU hospital. The Cascade Policy Institute, a local libertarian research group, criticized the project for being &quot;railroaded through the political process by small groups of private interests&quot;, and expressed doubt that tram construction would lead to new jobs.

Others argue that while the issues of increasing public costs are real, the importance of continued growth of OHSU for the city&#x27;s economy must be factored in as well. Not only is it the largest employer in the city, but OHSU is an important and effective vehicle to attract both federal funding, totaling more than $168 million for 2005, and a highly skilled workforce to the area. The growth in the current campus on the Marquam Hill is limited by access roads and parking, an expansion of which would likely cause more dramatic harm to the surrounding communities.

===Architectural and visual impacts===
The tram has been praised for its visual impact. Critic Jeff Jahn of PortlandArt.net called the tram &quot;the most significant new piece of architecture to be added to Portland since Michael Graves&#x27; Portland Building in 1980&quot;. The tram has also won several architectural awards, including the American Institute of Architects&#x27; Los Angeles chapter&#x27;s 2006 NEXT Honor Award, and the 2007 Presidential Award of Excellence from the American Institute of Steel Construction. 

According to city commissioner Adams, a cheaper alternative which would have changed the tower&#x27;s designs to a lattice style used in electrical transmission towers, was not considered because the result would look like an &quot;ugly ski lift at a bad ski resort&quot; and leave the city with what Adams called an &quot;ugly postcard&quot; that could last 100 years. Critics of the tram have also expressed concern over the tram&#x27;s spoiling views for the homeowners from the city&#x27;s West Hills, particularly from Gibbs Street, under the tram.

<text>Edith Marie McGuire (born June 3, 1944), later known as Edith McGuire Duvall, is an American former sprinter.

Born in Atlanta, Georgia, McGuire ran for Tennessee State University. TSU had a very successful women&#x27;s sprinting team, The Tigerbelles, in the 1960s, including triple Olympic champions Wilma Rudolph, Wyomia Tyus, and McGuire.

Although McGuire&#x27;s running career was short, she won six AAU titles, in three different events. Her specialty, however, was the 200 m/220 y, in which she won four of her six national titles. In 1964, she was undefeated in her favorite event, and went to Tokyo as the main contender for the 200 m gold medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics.

McGuire first competed in the 100 m in Japan, and lost out in the final to teammate Tyus. But in the 200 m final, she held off Poland&#x27;s Irena Kirszenstein to take the gold medal. She added a third medal to her tally as a member of the American 4×100 m relay team, which placed second to Poland.

Edith McGuire ended her athletics career in 1965, and became a teacher. In 1980 she was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame. At present, she owns a number of fast food restaurants in Oakland, California together with her husband Charles Duvall.

<text>Georgian Airways (), formerly Airzena, is the privately owned flag carrier of Georgia, with its headquarters in Tbilisi. Its main base is Tbilisi International Airport. The company filed for bankruptcy on 31 December 2021, linked to a restructuring procedure, and it has been for sale since January 2022.
== History ==

The airline Airzena was established in September 1993. Initially, Airzena operated charter flights to the United Arab Emirates, Italy, China, Egypt, India, and Syria, as well as a regularly scheduled flight to Vienna. The company managed to achieve recognition and retain its share in the aviation market during the economically and politically complicated period of the 1990s.

In 1999 Airzena became the flag carrier of Georgia. In August 2004, the company changed its name to &quot;Georgian Airways.&quot; During the first half of the 2000s, the airline&#x27;s management decided to modernise the fleet, and leased two Boeing 737-500s from Hapag-Lloyd. This was the first case of a Georgian airline operating up-to-date Western equipment.

== Russian sanctions ==
Following what Russia perceived as anti-Russian protests in June 2019, it banned all flights to and from Georgia starting 8 July 2019. Georgian Airways flights to Moscow-Vnukovo have since been operated by Aircompany Armenia via Yerevan. The ban was revoked by Russian president Vladimir Putin on 10 May 2023 starting 15 May and Georgian Airways announced it would then resume flights to Moscow from 20 May, with the first flight arriving in Vnukovo on that day. In response, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky imposed sanctions against the airline on 1 July.

== Bankruptcy ==
Georgian Airways filed for bankruptcy on 31 December 2021, linked to restructuring proceedings, and the airline was put up for sale in January 2022. The airline is in debt of (), against in assets. The causes include the Russian flight ban since July 2019, but most of all, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the airline hard. The Georgian authorities banned international air traffic for 11 months, with the exception of a number of monthly government mandated flights for repatriation purposes (operated by Georgian Airways). Georgian Airways cut back on its fleet (such as disposing of its Embraer planes) but with the Georgian resumption of international air traffic in February 2021, it could only offer six destinations.

The insolvency plan focused on the year-round profitable routes (Amsterdam, Tel Aviv and Minsk) and a few profitable seasonal charters, while guaranteeing these flights. Georgian Airways indicated in January 2022 that it would continue to operate the flights. Currently, the airline operates more routes.

== Destinations ==
As of October 2024, Georgian Airways operates scheduled services from Tbilisi International Airport to destinations in the European Union, Israel and Russia, while it jointly sells (but does not operate) flights to Armenia and France.

===Partners===
Georgian Airways partners with the following airlines:

* Aegean Airlines
* Air Astana
* Air France
* Austrian Airlines
* Azerbaijan Airlines
* Delta Air Lines
* El Al
* Iran Air
* KLM
== Fleet ==

<text>The Mesobatrachia (Ancient Greek &quot;μέσος&quot; (mésos, &quot;middle&quot;) + &quot;batrachia&quot; (&quot;frogs&quot;)) is a paraphyletic group of relatively primitive frogs. At the end of 2016, it contained 3 superfamilies (Pelobatoidea, Pelodytoidea and Pipoidea), 6 families, 16 genera, and 244 species. Recognized as a group in 1993, the name is contrasted with the primitive Archaeobatrachia and the more diverse and advanced Neobatrachia.

The Mesobatrachia comprise five fossorial families, including the spadefoot toads of Europe, North America, and East Asia, the parsley frogs, and the Mexican burrowing toad, as well as one obligatorily aquatic family, the Pipidae of Africa and South America. Later studies recognised that the group was paraphyletic with respect to Neobatrachia.

The families currently accepted in the Mesobatrachia suborder are:

* Megophryidae
* Pelobatidae
* Pelodytidae
* Pipidae
* Rhinophrynidae
* Scaphiopodidae

<text>Public administration, or public policy and administration refers to &quot;the management of public programs&quot;, or the &quot;translation of politics into the reality that citizens see every day&quot;, and also to the academic discipline which studies how public policy is created and implemented.

In an academic context, public administration has been described as the study of government decision-making; the analysis of policies and the various inputs that have produced them; and the inputs necessary to produce alternative policies. It is also a subfield of political science where studies of policy processes and the structures, functions, and behavior of public institutions and their relationships with broader society take place. The study and application of public administration is founded on the principle that the proper functioning of an organization or institution relies on effective management.

The mid-twentieth century saw the rise of German sociologist Max Weber&#x27;s theory of bureaucracy, bringing about a substantive interest in the theoretical aspects of public administration. The 1968 Minnowbrook Conference, which convened at Syracuse University under the leadership of Dwight Waldo, gave rise to the concept of New Public Administration, a pivotal movement within the discipline today.

==Definitions==
Public administration encompasses the execution, oversight, and management of government policies and the management of public affairs. The field involves the organization, operation, and strategic coordination of bureaucratic structures in the public sector. Public administrators play a significant role in devising and executing policies, managing shared resources, and ensuring the efficient functioning of government agencies and programs.
In 1947, Paul H. Appleby defined public administration as the &quot;public leadership of public affairs directly responsible for executive action.&quot; In democracies, it usually has to do with such leadership and executive action in terms that respect and contribute to the dignity, worth, and potential of the citizen. One year later, Gordon Clapp, then Chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, defined public administration &quot;as a public instrument whereby democratic society may be more completely realized.&quot; This implies that it must relate itself to concepts of justice, liberty, and fuller economic opportunity for human beings and is thus concerned with &quot;people, with ideas, and with things&quot;. James D. Carroll and Alfred M. Zuck called Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s publication of his essay, &quot;The Study of Administration,&quot; &quot;the beginning of public administration as a specific and influential field of study.&quot;

More recently, scholars claim that &quot;public administration has no generally accepted definition&quot; because the &quot;scope of the subject is so great and so debatable that it is easier to explain than define.&quot; Public administration is a field of study (i.e., a discipline) and an occupation. There is much disagreement about whether the study of public administration can properly be called a discipline, largely because of the debate over whether public administration is a sub-field of political science or a sub-field of administrative science, the latter an outgrowth of its roots in policy analysis and evaluation research. Scholar Donald F. Kettl is among those who view public administration &quot;as a sub-field within political science.&quot; According to Lalor, a society with a public authority that provides at least one public good can be said to have a public administration, whereas the absence of either (or &quot;a fortiori&quot; both) a public authority or the provision of at least one public good implies the absence of a public administration. He argues that public administration is the public provision of public goods in which the demand function is satisfied more or less effectively by politics, whose primary tool is rhetoric, providing for public goods, and the supply function is satisfied more or less efficiently by public management, whose primary tools are speech acts, producing public goods. The moral purpose of public administration, implicit in its acceptance of its role, is the maximization of the opportunities of the public to satisfy its wants.

The North American Industry Classification System definition of the Public Administration sector (NAICS 91) states that public administration &quot;... comprises establishments primarily engaged in activities of a governmental nature, that is, the enactment and judicial interpretation of laws and their pursuant regulations, and the administration of programs based on them.&quot; This includes &quot;legislative activities, taxation, national defense, public order and safety, immigration services, foreign affairs and international assistance, and the administration of government programs are activities that are purely governmental in nature.&quot;

==History==

===India in the 6th century BCE===
The Harappa and Mohenjo-daro civilizations had organized bodies of public servants, suggesting the presence of some form of public administration. Numerous references exist to Brihaspati&#x27;s contributions to laws and governance. An excerpt from Ain-i-Akbari [vol.III, tr. by H. S. Barrett, p. 217–218], written by Abul Fazl, mentions a symposium of philosophers from various faiths held in 1578 at Akbar&#x27;s instance. It is believed that some Charvaka thinkers may have participated in the symposium. In &quot;Naastika,&quot; Fazl refers to the Charvaka law-makers emphasizing &quot;good work, judicious administration, and welfare schemes.&quot; Somadeva also describes the Charvaka method of defeating the nation&#x27;s enemies, referring to thirteen disguised enemies in the kingdom with selfish interests who should not be spared. Kautilya presents a detailed scheme to remove the enemies in the guise of friends. The Charvaka stalwart, Brihaspati, is more ancient than Kautilya and Somadeva. He appears to be contemporaneous with the Harappa and Mohenjo-daro cultures.

Archaeological evidence regarding kings, priests, and palaces in the Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro excavations is limited. However, the presence of complex civilization and public facilities such as granaries and bathhouses, along with the existence of large cities, indicates the likelihood of centralized governance. The uniformity in the artifacts and brick sizes suggests that there was some form of centralized governance. Although speculation regarding social hierarchies and class structures is plausible, the absence of discernible elite burial sites also suggests that most citizens were almost equal in status.

===Antiquity to the 19th century===
Dating back to antiquity, states have required officials like pages, treasurers, and tax collectors to administer the practical business of government. Before the 19th century, the staffing of most public administrations was rife with nepotism, favoritism, and political patronage, which was often referred to as a &quot;spoils system&quot;. Public administrators have long been the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of rulers. In medieval times, the abilities to read and write, as well as, add and subtract were as dominated by the educated elite as public employment. Consequently, the need for expert civil servants whose ability to read and write formed the basis for developing expertise in such necessary activities as legal record-keeping, paying and feeding armies, and levying taxes. As the European imperialist age progressed and the military powers extended their hold over other continents and people, the need for a sophisticated public administration grew.

==== Roots in ancient China ====
The field of management may have originated in ancient China, including, possibly, the first highly centralized bureaucratic state, and the earliest (by the second century BC) example of an meritocracy based on civil service tests. In regards to public administration, China was considered to be &quot;advanced&quot; compared to the rest of the world up until the end of the 18th century.

Thomas Taylor Meadows, the British consul in Guangzhou, argued in his &quot;Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China&quot; (1847) that &quot;the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only.&quot; Influenced by the ancient Chinese imperial examination, the Northcote–Trevelyan Report of 1854 recommended that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, and promotion should be through achievement rather than &quot;preferment, patronage, or purchase&quot;. This led to implementation of Her Majesty&#x27;s Civil Service as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy. Like the British, the development of French bureaucracy was influenced by the Chinese system. Voltaire claimed that the Chinese had &quot;perfected moral science&quot; and François Quesnay advocated an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese. French civil service examinations adopted in the late 19th century were also heavily based on general cultural studies. These features have been likened to the earlier Chinese model.

Though Chinese administration cannot be traced to any one individual, figures of the Fa-Jia emphasizing a merit system, like Shen Buhai (400–337 BC), may have had the most influence, and could be considered its founders, if they are not valuable as rare pre-modern examples of the abstract theory of administration. Creel writes that, in Shen Buhai, there are the &quot;seeds of the civil service examination&quot;, and that, if one wishes to exaggerate, it would &quot;no doubt be possible to translate Shen Buhai&#x27;s term Shu, or technique, as &#x27;science&#x27;&quot;, and argue that he was the first political scientist, though Creel does &quot;not care to go this far&quot;.

==== Europe in the 18th century ====
In the 18th century, King Frederick William I of Prussia created professoriates in Cameralism in order to train a new class of public administrators. The universities of Frankfurt an der Oder and the University of Halle were Prussian institutions emphasizing economic and social disciplines, with the goal of societal reform. Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi was a well-known professor of Cameralism.

Lorenz von Stein, an 1855 German professor from Vienna, is considered the founder of the science of public administration in many parts of the world. In the time of Von Stein, public administration was considered a form of administrative law, but Von Stein believed this concept was too restrictive. Von Stein taught that public administration relies on many pre-established disciplines such as sociology, political science, administrative law, and public finance. He called public administration an integrating science and stated that public administrators should be concerned with both theory and practice. He argued that public administration is a science because knowledge is generated and evaluated according to the scientific method.

===In the United States===

The father of public administration in the US is considered to be Woodrow Wilson. He first formally recognized public administration in an 1887 article entitled &quot;The Study of Administration&quot;. The future president wrote that &quot;it is the object of administrative study to discover, first, what government can properly and successfully do, and, secondly, how it can do these proper things with the utmost possible efficiency and at the least possible cost either of money or energy.&quot;

By the 1920s, scholars of public administration had responded to Wilson&#x27;s solicitation and textbooks in this field were introduced. Distinguished scholars of that period include Luther Gulick, Lyndall Urwick, Henri Fayol, and Frederick Taylor. Taylor argued in &quot;The Principles of Scientific Management,&quot; that scientific analysis would lead to the discovery of the &quot;[a] best way&quot; to do things or carry out an operation. Taylor&#x27;s technique was introduced to private industrialists, and later to various government organizations.

The American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) the leading professional group for public administration was founded in 1939. ASPA sponsors the journal Public Administration Review, which was founded in 1940.

==== 1940s ====
The separation of politics and administration advocated by Wilson continues to play a significant role in public administration today. However, the dominance of this dichotomy was challenged by second-generation scholars, beginning in the 1940s. Luther Gulick&#x27;s fact-value dichotomy was a key contender for Wilson&#x27;s proposed politics-administration dichotomy. In place of Wilson&#x27;s first generation split, Gulick advocated a &quot;seamless web of discretion and interaction&quot;.

Luther Gulick and Lyndall Urwick are two second-generation scholars. Gulick, Urwick, and the new generation of administrators built on the work of contemporary behavioral, administrative, and organizational scholars including Henri Fayol, Fredrick Winslow Taylor, Paul Appleby, Frank Goodnow, and Willam Willoughby. The new generation of organizational theories no longer relied upon logical assumptions and generalizations about human nature like classical and enlightened theorists.

Gulick developed a comprehensive, generic theory of organization that emphasized the scientific method, efficiency, professionalism, structural reform, and executive control. Gulick summarized the duties of administrators with an acronym; POSDCORB, which stands for planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting. Fayol developed a systematic, 14-point treatment of private management. Second-generation theorists drew upon private management practices for administrative sciences. A single, generic management theory bleeding the borders between the private and the public sector was thought to be possible. With the general theory, the administrative theory could be focused on governmental organizations. The mid-1940s theorists challenged Wilson and Gulick. The politics-administration dichotomy remained the center of criticism.

==== 1950s - 1970s ====
During the 1950s, the United States experienced prolonged prosperity and solidified its place as a world leader. Public Administration experienced a kind of heyday due to the successful war effort and successful post-war reconstruction in Western Europe and Japan. Government was popular as was President Eisenhower. In the 1960s and 1970s, the government itself came under fire as ineffective, inefficient, and largely a wasted effort. The costly American intervention in Vietnam along with domestic scandals including the bugging of Democratic Party headquarters (the 1974 Watergate scandal) are two examples of self-destructive government behavior that alienated citizens.
There was a call by citizens for efficient administration to replace ineffective, wasteful bureaucracy. Public administration would have to distance itself from politics to answer this call and remain effective. Elected officials supported these reforms. The Hoover Commission, chaired by University of Chicago professor Louis Brownlow, examines the reorganization of government. Brownlow subsequently founded the Public Administration Service (PAS) at the university, an organization that provided consulting services to all levels of government until the 1970s.

Concurrently, after World War II, the entire concept of public administration expanded to include policymaking and analysis, thus the study of &quot;administrative policy making and analysis&quot; was introduced and enhanced into the government decision-making bodies. Later on, the human factor became a predominant concern and emphasis in the study of public administration. This period witnessed the development and inclusion of other social sciences knowledge, predominantly, psychology, anthropology, and sociology, into the study of public administration (Jeong, 2007). Henceforth, the emergence of scholars such as Fritz Morstein Marx, with his book &quot;The Elements of Public Administration&quot; (1946), Paul H. Appleby &quot;Policy and Administration&quot; (1952), Frank Marini &#x27;Towards a New Public Administration&#x27; (1971), and others that have contributed positively in these endeavors.

Stimulated by events during the 1960s such as an active civil rights movement, the Vietnam War and war protests, assassinations of a president and civil rights leaders, and an active women&#x27;s movement, public administration changed course somewhat. Landmark legislation such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also gave public administrators new responsibilities. These events were manifest in the public administration profession through the new public administration movement. &quot;Under the stimulating patronage of Dwight Waldo, some of the best of the younger generation of scholars challenged the doctrine they had received&quot;. These new scholars demanded more policy-oriented public administrators that incorporated &quot;four themes: relevance, values, equity, and change&quot;. All of these themes would encourage more participation among women and minorities.
Stimulated by the events of the &#x27;60s, the 1970s brought significant change to the American Society for Public Administration. Racial and ethnic minorities and women members organized to seek greater participation. Eventually, the Conference on Minority Public Administrators and the Section for Women in Public Administration were established.

==== 1980s - 1990s ====
In the late 1980s, yet another generation of public administration theorists began to displace the last. The new theory, which came to be called New Public Management, was proposed by David Osborne and Ted Gaebler in their book &quot;Reinventing Government&quot;. The new model advocated the use of private sector-style models, organizational ideas and values to improve the efficiency and service-orientation of the public sector. During the Clinton Administration (1993–2001), Vice President Al Gore adopted and reformed federal agencies using NPM approaches. In the 1990s, new public management became prevalent throughout the bureaucracies of the US, the UK, and to a lesser extent, in Canada. The original public management theories have roots attributed to policy analysis, according to Richard Elmore in his 1986 article published in the &quot;Journal of Policy Analysis and Management&quot;.

Some modern authors define NPM as a combination of splitting large bureaucracies into smaller, more fragmented agencies, encouraging competition between different public agencies, and encouraging competition between public agencies and private firms and using economic incentives lines (e.g., performance pay for senior executives or user-pay models). NPM treats individuals as &quot;customers&quot; or &quot;clients&quot; (in the private sector sense), rather than as citizens.

Some critics argue that the New Public Management concept of treating people as &quot;customers&quot; rather than &quot;citizens&quot; is an inappropriate borrowing from the private sector model, because businesses see customers as a means to an end (profit), rather than as the proprietors of government (the owners), opposed to merely the customers of a business (the patrons). In New Public Management, people are viewed as economic units not as democratic participants which is the hazard of linking an MBA (business administration, economic and employer-based model) too closely with the public administration (governmental, public good) sector. Nevertheless, the NPM model (one of four described by Elmore in 1986, including the &quot;generic model&quot;) is still widely accepted at multiple levels of government (e.g., municipal, state/province, and federal) and in many OECD nations.

In the late 1990s, Janet and Robert Denhardt proposed a new public services model in response to the dominance of NPM. A successor to NPM is digital era governance, focusing on themes of reintegrating government responsibilities, needs-based holism (executing duties in cursive ways), and digitalization (exploiting the transformational capabilities of modern IT and digital storage).

One example of the deployment of DEG is openforum.com.au, an Australian not-for-profit e-Democracy project that invites politicians, senior public servants, academics, business people, and other key stakeholders to engage in high-level policy debate. Another example is Brunei&#x27;s Information Department in deploying Social Media technology to improve its Digital Governance process. The book chapter work concludes that digital dividends can be secured through the effective application of Social Media within the framework of Digital Era Governance.

Another new public service model is what has been called New Public Governance, an approach that includes a centralization of power; an increased number, role, and influence of partisan-political staff; personal-politicization of appointments to the senior public service; and, the assumption that the public service is promiscuously partisan for the government of the day.

In the mid-1980s, the goal of community programs in the United States was often represented by terms such as independent living, community integration, inclusion, community participation, deinstitutionalization, and civil rights. Thus, the same public policy (and public administration) was to apply to all citizens, inclusive of disability. However, by the 1990s, categorical state systems were strengthened in the United States (Racino, in press, 2014), and efforts were made to introduce more disability content into the public policy curricula with disability public policy (and administration) distinct fields in their own right. Behaviorists have also dominated &quot;intervention practice&quot; (generally not the province of public administration) in recent years, believing that they are in opposition to generic public policy (termed ecological systems theory, of the late Urie Bronfenbrenner).

Increasingly, public policy academics and practitioners have utilized the theoretical concepts of political economy to explain policy outcomes such as the success or failure of reform efforts or the persistence of suboptimal outcomes.

==== Women&#x27;s civic clubs and the Settlement movement ====
Contemporary scholars are reclaiming a companion public administration origin story that includes the contributions of women. This has become known as the &quot;alternative&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot; model of public administration. During the 19th century upper-class women in the United States and Europe organized voluntary associations that worked to mitigate the excesses of urbanization and industrialization in their towns. Eventually, these voluntary associations became networks that were able to spearhead changes to policy and administration. These women&#x27;s civic clubs worked to make cities and workplaces safer (cleaner streets, water, sewage, and workplace. As well as workplace regulation) and more suited to the needs of their children (playgrounds, libraries, juvenile courts, child labor laws). These were administrative and policy spaces ignored by their fathers and husbands. The work of these clubs was amplified by newly organized non-profit organizations (Settlement Houses), usually situated in industrialized city slums filled with immigrants.

Reforms that emerged from the New Deal (e.g., income for the old, unemployment insurance, aid for dependent children and the disabled, child labor prohibitions and limits on hours worked, etc.) were supported by leaders of the Settlement movement. Richard Stillman credits Jane Addams, a key leader of the Settlement movement and a pioneer of public administration with &quot;conceiving and spawning&quot; the modern welfare state. The accomplishments of the Settlement movement and their conception of public administration were ignored in the early literature of public administration. The alternative model of Public Administration was invisible or buried for about 100 years until Camilla Stivers published &quot;Bureau Men and Settlement Women&quot; in 2000.

Settlement workers explicitly fought for social justice as they campaigned for reform. They sought policy changes that would improve the lives of immigrants, women, children, sick, old, and impoverished people. Both municipal housekeeping and industrial citizenship applied an ethic of care informed by the feminine experience of policy and administration. While they saw the relevance of the traditional public administration values (efficiency, effectiveness, etc.) and practices of their male reformist counterparts, they also emphasized social justice and social equity. Jane Addams, for example, was a founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

===== The Settlement Model of Public Administration =====
The Settlement movement and its leaders such as Jane Addams, Julia Lathrop, and Florence Kelley were instrumental in crafting the alternative, feminine inspired, model of public administration. This settlement model of public administration, had two interrelated components – municipal housekeeping and industrial citizenship. Municipal housekeeping called for cities to be run like a caring home, the city should be conceived as an extension of the home where families could be safe and children cared for. Clean streets, clean water, playgrounds, educational curricular reform, and juvenile courts, are examples of reforms associated with this movement. Industrial citizenship focused on the problems and risks of labor force participation in a laissez-faire, newly industrialized economy. Reforms that mitigated workplace problems such as child labor, unsanitary workplaces, excessive work schedules, risks of industrial accidents, and old age poverty were the focus of these efforts. Organized settlement women&#x27;s reform efforts led to workplace safety laws and inspections. Settlement reformers went on to serve as local, state, and federal administrators. Jane Addams was a garbage inspector, Florence Kelley served as the chief factory inspector for the State of Illinois, Julia Lathrop was the first director of the Women&#x27;s Bureau and Francis Perkins was Secretary of Labor during the F. Roosevelt Administration

==Branches==

=== Core branches ===
In academia, the field of public administration consists of several sub-fields. Scholars have proposed several different sets of sub-fields. One of the proposed models uses five &quot;pillars&quot;:
* Organizational theory in public administration is the study of the structure of governmental entities and the many particulars inculcated in them.
* Ethics in public administration serves as a normative approach to decision making.
* Policy analysis and program evaluation serves as an empirical approach to decision making.
* Public budgeting and public finance
** Public budgeting is the activity within a government that seeks to allocate scarce resources among unlimited demands.
** Public finance is the study of the role of the government in the economy. It is the branch of economics that assesses the government revenue and government expenditure of the public authorities and the adjustment of one or the other to achieve desirable effects and avoid undesirable ones.
* Human resource management is an in-house structure that ensures that public service staffing is done in an unbiased, ethical and values-based manner. The basic functions of the HR system are employee benefits, employee health care, compensation, and many more (e.g., human rights, Americans with Disabilities Act). The executives managing the HR director and other key departmental personnel are also part of the public administration system.

=== Other branches ===
* Nonprofit management is research into and the practice of operating nonprofit organizations and their effects.
* Emergency management is the managerial function charged with creating the framework within which communities reduce vulnerability to hazards and cope with disasters.
*  Information Technology in Public Administration
Examines the role of IT in enhancing public sector operations, including e-governance and digital service delivery.

==Academic field==
Universities can offer undergraduate and graduate degrees in Public Administration or Government, Political Science, and International Affairs with a concentration or specialization in Public Policy and Administration. Graduate degrees include the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree, a Master of Arts (MA) or Master of Science (MS) in Public Administration (for the management tract), and the Master of Public Policy (MPP), a Master of Arts (MA), or a Master of Science (MS) in Public Policy (for the research tract)

In the United States, the academic field of public administration draws heavily on political science and administrative law. Some MPA programs include economics courses to give students a background in micro-economic issues (markets, rationing mechanisms, etc.) and macroeconomic issues (e.g., national debt). Scholars such as John A. Rohr write of a long history behind the constitutional legitimacy of government bureaucracy.

One public administration scholar, Donald Kettl, argues that &quot;public administration sits in a disciplinary backwater&quot;, because &quot;for the last generation, scholars have sought to save or replace it with fields of study like implementation, public management, and formal bureaucratic theory&quot;. Kettl states that &quot;public administration, as a subfield within political science ... is struggling to define its role within the discipline&quot;. He notes two problems with public administration: it &quot;has seemed methodologically to lag behind&quot; and &quot;the field&#x27;s theoretical work too often seems not to define it&quot;-indeed, &quot;some of the most interesting recent ideas in public administration have come from outside the field&quot;.

Public administration theory is the domain in which discussions of the meaning and purpose of government, the role of bureaucracy in supporting democratic governments, budgets, governance, and public affairs take place.

===Comparative public administration===
Comparative public administration or CPA is defined as the study of administrative systems in a comparative fashion or the study of public administration in other countries. Today, there is a section of the American Society for Public Administration that specializes in comparative administration. It is responsible for the annual Riggs Award for Lifetime Achievement in International and Comparative Public Administration.

There have been several issues that have hampered the development of comparative public administration, including the major differences between Western countries and developing countries; the lack of curriculum on this sub-field in public administration programs; and the lack of success in developing theoretical models that can be scientifically tested. Even though CPA is a weakly formed field as a whole, this sub-field of public administration is an attempt at cross-cultural analysis, a &quot;quest for patterns and regularities of administrative action and behavior.&quot; CPA is an integral part to the analysis of public administration techniques. The process of comparison allows for more widely applicable policies to be tested in a variety of situations.

Comparative public administration lacks a curriculum, which has prevented it from becoming a major field of study. This lack of understanding of the basic concepts that build this field&#x27;s foundation has ultimately led to its lack of use. For example, William Waugh, a professor at Georgia State University has stated &quot;Comparative studies are difficult because of the necessity to provide enough information on the socio-political context of national administrative structures and processes for readers to understand why there are differences and similarities.&quot; He also asserts, &quot;Although there is sizable literature on comparative public administration it is scattered and dated.&quot;

=== Bachelor&#x27;s degrees, academic concentrations, and academic minors ===

Universities offer undergraduate level Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Public Administration or Government, Political Science, and International Affairs with an academic concentration or specialization in Public Policy and Administration. At several universities undergraduate-level public administration and non-profit management education is packaged together (along with international relations and security studies) in a degree in political science.

===Master&#x27;s degrees===

Some public administration programs have similarities to business administration programs, in cases where the students from both the Master&#x27;s in Public Administration (MPA) and Master&#x27;s in Business Administration (MBA) programs take many of the same courses. 
Master of Business Administration (MBA) is a postgraduate degree focused on business principles, management, and leadership skills, typically aimed at preparing students for managerial roles in the print sector. Master of Public Administration (MPA) is a postgraduate degree focused on the theory and practice of public administration, management, and policy. 

===Doctoral degrees===
There are two types of doctoral degrees in public administration: the Doctor of Public Administration (DPA) and the Ph.D. in public administration. The DPA is an applied-research doctoral degree in the field of public administration, focusing on the practice of public administration more than on its theoretical aspects. The Ph.D. is typically sought by individuals aiming to become professors of public administration or researchers. Individuals pursuing a Ph.D. in public administration often pursue more theoretical dissertation topics than their DPA counterparts.

===Notable scholars===

Notable scholars of public administration have come from a wide range of fields. In the period before public administration existed as its own independent sub-discipline of political science, scholars contributing to the field came from economics, sociology, management, political science, legal—specifically administrative law—and other related fields. More recently, scholars from public administration and public policy have contributed important studies and theories.

==International organizations==
There are a number of international public administration organizations. The Commonwealth Association of Public Administration and Management (CAPAM) includes the 56 member states of the Commonwealth from India and the UK to Nauru. The oldest organization is the International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS), based in Brussels, Belgium. Another body, the International Committee of the US-based Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration (NASPAA), has developed several relationships around the world. They include sub regional and National forums like CLAD, INPAE and NISPAcee, APSA, ASPA.

The Center for Latin American Administration for Development (CLAD), based in Caracas, Venezuela, is a regional network of schools of public administration set up by the governments in Latin America.

NISPAcee is a network of experts, scholars and practitioners who work in the field of public administration in central Europe and Eastern Europe, including the Russian Federation and the Caucasus and Central Asia.

Eastern Regional Organization for Public Administration (EROPA) is a state-membership based organization, open to other organizations and individuals, headquartered in the Philippines with centers and membership organized around the Asia Pacific region. EROPA organizes annual conferences and publishes a journal &quot;Asian Review of Public Administration&quot; (ARPA). It has several centers in the region, and assists in networking experts with its members.

==Public management==

&quot;Public management&quot; is an approach to government administration and nonprofit administration that resembles or draws on private-sector management and business techniques and approaches. These business approaches often aim to maximize efficiency and effectiveness and provide improved customer service. A contrast is drawn with the study of public administration, which emphasizes the social and cultural drivers of government that many contend (e.g., Graham T. Allison and Charles Goodsell) makes it different from the private sector. A positive and negative definition of public management have been proposed. The positive approach as: &quot;praxeological and rightful process of public service for citizens for the sake of their and following generations good through strengthening mutual relationships, competitiveness of national economy and practical increase of social utility through effective allocation of public resources&quot;. Negative approach as: &quot;Fiction, whose aim is the possibility of temporal or permanent appropriation of public goods for the implementation of the particular interests of a narrow social group&quot;. Studying and teaching about public management are widely practiced in developed nations.

<doc id="587624" wikidata="Q2348453" url="?curid=587624" title="Lotta Svärd">
<text>Lotta Svärd () was a Finnish voluntary auxiliary paramilitary organisation for women. Formed originally in 1918, it had a large membership undertaking volunteer social work in the 1920s and 1930s. It was formed to support the White Guard. During the Second World War, it mobilized to replace men conscripted into the army. It served in hospitals, at air raid warning positions, and other auxiliary tasks in close cooperation with the army. The women were officially unarmed except for an antiaircraft battery in 1944. Virtanen argues that, their &quot;accountability to the nation took a masculine and military form in public, but had a private, feminine side to it including features like caring, helping and loving.&quot; The organisation was disbanded by the government after the war.

== Name ==

The name comes from a poem by Johan Ludvig Runeberg. Part of a large and famous book, &quot;The Tales of Ensign Stål&quot;, the poem described a fictional woman named Lotta Svärd. According to the poem, a Finnish soldier, private Svärd – means a sword – went to fight in the Finnish War and took his wife, Lotta, along with him. Private Svärd was killed in battle, but his wife remained on the battlefield, taking care of wounded soldiers. The name was first brought up by Marshal Mannerheim in a speech given on 16 May 1918.

==History==
During the Finnish Civil War it was associated with the White Guard. After the war Lotta Svärd was founded as a separate organisation on 9 September 1920. The first known organisation to use the name Lotta Svärd was the Lotta Svärd of Riihimäki, founded on 11 November 1918.
The organisation expanded during the 1920s and it included 60,000 members in 1930. Helmi Arneberg-Pentti was chairman of Lotta Svärd from 1921 to 1922 and 1925 to 1929. By 1944 it included 242,000 volunteers, the largest voluntary auxiliary organisation in the world, while the total population of Finland was less than four million. Fanni Luukkonen was the leader of Lotta Svärd from 1929 to 1944.

Inspired by the Finnish Lotta Svärd, a similar organisation was founded in Stockholm, Sweden in 1924 by Tyra Wadner. The organisation, which later took the name Sveriges lottakårer [the Swedish Lotta corps], kept close contact with its Finnish sister-organisation.

During the 1920s and 1930s only Christian Finnish citizens were eligible to join, and two references from persons considered reliable were required. The latter requirement was often ignored after the break of Winter War in 1939. Foreigners could be accepted by special permission. However, in 1940 the first Muslim and Jewish members were accepted, and the first non-denominational member in 1941.

==World War II==

During the Winter War some 100,000 men whose jobs were taken over by &quot;Lottas&quot; were freed for military service. The Lottas worked in hospitals, at air-raid warning posts and other auxiliary tasks in conjunction with the armed forces. The Lottas, however, were officially unarmed. The only exception was a voluntary anti-aircraft battery in Helsinki in summer 1944, composed of Lotta Svärd members. The battery operated the AA search-lights. The unit was issued rifles for self-protection, thus being the only armed female military unit of the Finnish Defence Forces history. The medical section was led by doctor Suoma af Hällström.

The dire need for labour led to fast recruitment and there was often no time to properly train the new Lottas according to the principles of the organisation. In addition, most new recruits were young and inexperienced. This caused some friction between the veterans and the new recruits.

Lotta Svärd suffered relatively light losses, considering the number of women posted to a war zone and the length of the war. During the wars 291 Lottas died, 140 from diseases caught on duty, 66 were killed on the front, 47 in air raids and 34 in accidents. The fallen Lottas were buried in war heroes&#x27; graves in their home parishes.

==Postwar==
When the Continuation War (1941–1944) ended, the Soviet Union demanded the ban of all organisations that it considered to be paramilitary, fascist or semi-fascist. Lotta Svärd was one of the groups that was disbanded, on 23 November 1944. However, a new organisation, Suomen Naisten Huoltosäätiö, was started and took over much of the old property. The organisation still exists by the name of Lotta Svärd Säätiö (Lotta Svärd Foundation).

The Finnish Lotta Svärd organisation has inspired similar organisations in other countries and there is still a Lotta Svärd organisation in Sweden (the Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization (&quot;Lottorna&quot;); the same model is also used in Denmark and Norway.

<doc id="587627" wikidata="Q310121" url="?curid=587627" title="William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse">
<text>William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse (17 June 1800 – 31 October 1867), was an English engineer and astronomer. He built several giant telescopes.
His 72-inch telescope, built in 1845 and colloquially known as the &quot;Leviathan of Parsonstown&quot;, was the world&#x27;s largest telescope, in terms of aperture size, until the early 20th century. From April 1807 until February 1841, he was styled as Baron Oxmantown.

==Life==
He was born in York, England, the son of Sir Lawrence Parsons, later 2nd Earl of Rosse, and Alice Lloyd. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin and Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating with first-class honours in mathematics in 1822. He inherited an earldom and a large estate in King&#x27;s County (now County Offaly) in Ireland when his father, Lawrence, 2nd Earl of Rosse, died in February 1841.

Lord Rosse married Mary Field, daughter of John Wilmer Field, on 14 April 1836. They had thirteen offspring, of which four sons survived to adulthood:

* Lawrence, 4th Earl of Rosse (known as Baron Oxmantown until 1867; 17 November 1840 – 30 August 1908).
* The Rev. Randal Parsons (26 April 1848 – 15 November 1936).
* The Hon. Richard Clere Parsons (21 February 1851 – 26 January 1923), apparently known for developing railways in South America.
* The Hon. Sir Charles Algernon Parsons (13 June 1854 – 11 February 1931), known for inventing the steam turbine.

In addition to his astronomical interests, Rosse served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for King&#x27;s County from 1821 to 1834, president of the British Association in 1843–1844, an Irish representative peer after 1845, president of the Royal Society (1848–1854), and chancellor of the University of Dublin (Trinity College Dublin) (1862–1867). He was appointed Colonel of the disembodied King&#x27;s County Royal Rifle Militia (a regiment formerly commanded by his father) from 19 June 1834 and was joined by his younger brother the Hon Lawrence Parsons as Lieutenant-Colonel from 24 December 1847. When the regiment was next embodied, in 1852, the position of colonel had become an honorary post.

==Scientific studies==
During the 1840s, he had the Leviathan of Parsonstown built, a 72-inch (6 feet/1.83 m) telescope at Birr Castle, Parsonstown, County Offaly. The telescope replaced a telescope that he had built previously.
He had to invent many of the techniques he used for constructing the Leviathan, both because its size was without precedent and because earlier telescope builders had guarded their secrets or had not published their methods. Details of the metal, casting, grinding and polishing of the 3-ton &#x27;speculum&#x27; were presented in 1844 at the Belfast Natural History Society. Rosse&#x27;s telescope was considered a marvellous technical and architectural achievement, and images of it were circulated widely within the British Commonwealth. Building of the Leviathan began in 1842 and it was first used in 1845; regular use waited another two years, due to the Great Irish Famine. It was the world&#x27;s largest telescope, in terms of aperture size, until the early 20th century. Using this telescope Rosse saw and catalogued a large number of nebulae (including a number that would later be recognised as galaxies).
Lord Rosse performed astronomical studies and discovered the spiral nature of some nebulae, today known to be spiral galaxies. Rosse&#x27;s telescope Leviathan was the first to reveal the spiral structure of M51, a galaxy nicknamed later as the &quot;Whirlpool Galaxy&quot;, and his drawings of it closely resemble modern photographs.

The Crab Nebula received its name based on a drawing made by Rosse in the early 1840s with his older 36-inch (91 cm) telescope in which it resembled a crab. A few years later, when the 72-inch (183 cm) telescope was in service, he (or one of his assistants) produced an improved drawing of a considerably different appearance, but the original name continued to be used.
A main component of Rosse&#x27;s nebular research was his attempt to resolve the nebular hypothesis, which posited that planets and stars were formed by gravity acting on gaseous nebulae. Rosse himself did not believe that nebulas were truly gaseous, arguing rather that they were made of such an amount of fine stars that most telescopes could not resolve them individually (that is, he considered nebulas to be stellar in nature). In 1845 Rosse and his technicians claimed to have resolved the Orion nebula into its individual stars using the Leviathan, a claim which had considerable cosmological and even philosophical implications, as at the time there was considerable debate over whether or not the universe was &quot;evolved&quot; (in a pre-Darwinian sense), a concept which the nebular hypothesis supported and with which Rosse disagreed strongly. Rosse&#x27;s primary opponent in this was John Herschel, who used his own instruments to claim that the Orion nebula was a &quot;true&quot; nebula (i.e. gaseous, not stellar), and discounted Rosse&#x27;s instruments as flawed (a criticism Rosse returned about Herschel&#x27;s own). Eventually, neither man (nor telescope) could establish sufficiently scientific results to resolve the question (the convincing evidence for the gaseous nature of the nebula would be developed later from William Huggins&#x27;s spectroscopic evidence, though it would not immediately resolve the philosophical issues).
One of Rosse&#x27;s telescope admirers was Thomas Langlois Lefroy, a fellow Irish MP, who said, &quot;The planet Jupiter, which through an ordinary glass is no larger than a good star, is seen twice as large as the moon appears to the naked eye... But the genius displayed in all the contrivances for wielding this mighty monster even surpasses the design and execution of it. The telescope weighs sixteen tons, and yet Lord Rosse raised it single-handed off its resting place, and two men with ease raised it to any height.&quot;

Lord Rosse&#x27;s son published his father&#x27;s findings, including the discovery of 226 NGC objects in the publication &quot;Observations of Nebulae and Clusters of Stars Made With the Six-foot and Three-foot Reflectors at Birr Castle From the Year 1848 up to the Year 1878&quot;, Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society Vol. II, 1878.
==Lord Rosse&#x27;s telescopes==
Lord Rosse had a variety of optical reflecting telescopes built. Rosse&#x27;s telescopes used cast speculum metal ground parabolically and polished.

*15-inch (38 cm)
*24-inch (61 cm)
*36-inch (91 cm) (aka Rosse 3-foot telescope)
*72-inch (180 cm) (aka Rosse 6-foot telescope or &quot;Leviathan of Parsonstown&quot;), started in 1842 and completed in 1845.

<doc id="587642" wikidata="Q7293303" url="?curid=587642" title="Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom">
<text>Three national rankings of universities in the United Kingdom are published annually by &quot;The Complete University Guide&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and jointly by &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Rankings have also been produced in the past by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Financial Times&quot;. UK Universities also rank highly in global university rankings with 8 UK Universities ranking in the top 100 of all three major global rankings as of 2023/24: &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;, &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; and &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot;.

The primary aim of the rankings is to inform potential undergraduate applicants about UK universities based on a range of criteria, including entry standards, student satisfaction, staff/student ratio, academic services and facilities expenditure per student, research quality, proportion of Firsts and 2:1s, completion rates and student destinations. All of the league tables also rank universities on their strength in individual subjects.

Each year since 2008, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; has compiled a &quot;Table of Tables&quot; to combine the results of the 3 mainstream league tables. In the 2022 table, the top 5 universities were the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, the University of St Andrews, the London School of Economics and Imperial College.

== Rankings ==

The following rankings of British universities are produced annually:

===&quot;The Complete University Guide&quot;===

&quot;The Complete University Guide&quot; is compiled by Mayfield University Consultants and was published for the first time in 2007.

The ranking uses ten criteria, with a statistical technique called the Z-score applied to the results of each. The effect of this is to ensure that the weighting given to each criterion is not distorted by the choice of scale used to score that criterion. The ten Z-scores are then weighted (as given below) and summed to give a total score for each university. These total scores are then transformed to a scale where the top score is set at 1,000, with the remainder being a proportion of the top score. The ten criteria are:
The most recent league table (2025) ranked the top 40 (out of 130) British universities as follows:

=== &quot;The Guardian&quot; ===

&quot;The Guardian&quot; ranking uses nine different criteria, each weighted between 5 and 15 per cent. Unlike other annual rankings of British universities, the criteria do not include a measure of research output. A &quot;value-added&quot; factor is included which compares students&#x27; degree results with their entry qualifications, described by the newspaper as being &quot;[b]ased upon a sophisticated indexing methodology that tracks students from enrolment to graduation, qualifications upon entry are compared with the award that a student receives at the end of their studies&quot;. Tables are drawn up for subjects, with the overall ranking being based on an average across the subjects rather than on institutional level statistics. The nine criteria are:

*&quot;Entry scores&quot; (15%);
*&quot;Assessment and feedback&quot; (10%) – as rated by graduates of the course (data source: National Student Survey);
*&quot;Career prospects&quot; (15%) (data source: Destination of Leavers from Higher Education);
*&quot;Overall satisfaction&quot; (5%) – final-year students&#x27; opinions about the overall quality of their course (data source: National Student Survey);
*&quot;Expenditure per student&quot; (5%);
*&quot;Student-staff ratio&quot; (15%);
*&quot;Teaching&quot; (10%) – as rated by graduates of the course (data source: the National Student Survey);
*&quot;Value added&quot; (15%);
*&quot;Continuation&quot; (10%).

The most recent league table (2025) ranked the top 40 (out of 122) British universities as follows:

=== &quot;The Times/The Sunday Times&quot; ===
&quot;The Times/The Sunday Times&quot; university league table, known as the Good University Guide, is published in both electronic and print format. Since 1999, the guide also recognises one university annually as &quot;University of the Year&quot;. It ranks institutions using the following eight criteria:

* &quot;Student satisfaction (+50 to −55 points)&quot; – the results of national student surveys are scored taking a theoretical minimum and maximum score of 50% and 90% respectively (data source: the National Student Survey);
* &quot;Teaching excellence (250)&quot; – defined as: subjects scoring at least 22/24 points, those ranked excellent, or those undertaken more recently in which there is confidence in academic standards and in which teaching and learning, student progression and learning resources have all been ranked commendable (data source: Quality Assurance Agency; Scottish Higher Education Funding Council; Higher Education Funding Council for Wales);
* &quot;Heads&#x27;/peer assessments (100)&quot; – school heads are asked to identify the highest-quality undergraduate provision (data source: &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; heads&#x27; survey and peer assessment);
* &quot;Research quality (200)&quot; – based upon the most recent Research Assessment Exercise (data source: Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce));
* &quot;A-level/Higher points (250)&quot; – nationally audited data for the subsequent academic year are used for league table calculations (data source: HESA);
* &quot;Unemployment (100)&quot; – the number of students assume to be unemployed six months after graduation is calculated as a percentage of the total number of known desbefore completing their courses is compared with the number expected to do so (the benchmark figure shown in brackets) (data source: Hefce, Performance Indicators in Higher Education).

Other criteria considered are:

*&quot;Completion&quot; – the percentage of students who manage to complete their degree;
*&quot;Entry standards&quot; – the average UCAS tariff score (data source: HESA);
*&quot;Facilities spending&quot; – the average expenditure per student on sports, careers services, health and counselling;
*&quot;Good honours&quot; – the percentage of students graduating with a first or 2.1;
*&quot;Graduate prospects&quot; – the percentage of UK graduates in graduate employment or further study (data source: HESA&#x27;s survey of Destination of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE));
*&quot;Library and computing spending&quot; – the average expenditure on library and computer services per student (data source: HESA);
*&quot;Research&quot; (data source: 2021 Research Excellence Framework);
*&quot;Student satisfaction&quot; (data source: National Student Survey); and
*&quot;Student-staff ratio&quot; (data source: HESA).

===Summary of national rankings===

The following universities rank in the top 10 in at least two of the most recent national rankings (the three discussed above: the Complete, Guardian and Times/Sunday Times). The table is ordered according to the average rank in the tables for that year. The last column gives the number of league tables (not including the Table of Tables) which include that university in their top ten.

== Disparity with global rankings ==
It has been commented by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that a number of universities which regularly feature in the top ten of British university league tables, such as St Andrews, Durham and LSE (in the case of LSE 3rd to 4th nationally whilst only 101–150th in the &quot;ARWU Rankings&quot; / 56th in the &quot;QS Rankings&quot; / 37th in the &quot;THE Rankings&quot;), &quot;inhabit surprisingly low ranks in the worldwide tables&quot;, whilst other universities such as Manchester, Edinburgh and KCL &quot;that failed to do well in the domestic rankings have shone much brighter on the international stage&quot;. The considerable disparity in rankings has been attributed to the different methodology and purpose of global university rankings such as the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot;, &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;, and &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;. International university rankings primarily use criteria such as academic and employer surveys, the number of citations per faculty, the proportion of international staff and students and faculty and alumni prize winners. 
When size is taken into account, LSE ranks second in the world out of all small to medium-sized specialist institutions (after ENS Paris) and St Andrews ranks second in the world out of all small to medium-sized fully comprehensive universities (after Brown University) using metrics from the QS Intelligence Unit in 2015. The national rankings, on the other hand, give most weighting to the undergraduate student experience, taking account of teaching quality and learning resources, together with the quality of a university&#x27;s intake, employment prospects, research quality and drop-out rates.

The disparity between national and international league tables has caused some institutions to offer public explanations for the difference. LSE for example states on its website that &#x27;we remain concerned that all of the global rankings – by some way the most important for us, given our highly international orientation – suffer from inbuilt biases in favour of large multi-faculty universities with full STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) offerings, and against small, specialist, mainly non-STEM universities such as LSE.&#x27;

Research by the UK&#x27;s Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) in 2016 found that global rankings fundamentally measure research performance, with research-related measures accounting for over 85 percent of the weighting for both the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; and &quot;QS&quot; rankings and 100 percent of the weighting for the &quot;ARWU&quot; ranking. HEPI also found that &quot;ARWU&quot; made no correction for the size of an institution. There were also concerns about the data quality and the reliability of reputation surveys. National rankings, while said to be &quot;of varying validity&quot;, have more robust data and are &quot;more highly regarded than international rankings&quot;.

===British Universities in global rankings===

The following universities rank in the top 100 in at least two global rankings:

==Criticism==

===Accuracy and neutrality===
There has been criticism of attempts to combine different rankings on for example research quality, quality of teaching, drop out rates and student satisfaction. Sir Alan Wilson, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Leeds, argues that the final average has little significance and is like trying to &quot;combine apples and oranges&quot;. He also criticised the varying weights given to different factors, the need for universities to &quot;chase&quot; the rankings, the often fluctuating nature of a university&#x27;s ranking, and the catch-22 that the government&#x27;s desire to increase access can have negative effects on league table rankings. Further worries have been expressed regarding marketing strategies and propaganda used to chase tables, thus undermining universities&#x27; values.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; suggests that league tables may affect the nature of undergraduate admissions in an attempt to improve a university&#x27;s league table position.

Roger Brown, the former Vice-Chancellor of Southampton Solent University, highlights perceived limitations in comparative data between Universities.

Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Professor Geoffrey Alderman makes the point that including the percentage of &#x27;good honours&#x27; can encourage grade inflation so that league table position can be maintained.

The rankings are also criticised for not giving a full picture of higher education in the United Kingdom. There are institutions which focus on research and enjoy a prestigious reputation but are not shown in the table for various reasons. For example, the Institute of Education, University of London (now part of UCL), was not usually listed in the undergraduate rankings despite the fact that it offered an undergraduate BEd and was generally recognised as one of the best institutions offering teacher training and Education studies (for example, being given joint first place, alongside Oxford University, in the 2008 Research Assessment &#x27;Education&#x27; subject rankings, according to both Times Higher Education and The Guardian).

The INORMS Research Evaluation Group have developed an initiative called More Than Our Rank which allows universities to describe in a narrative format their activities, achievements and ambitions not captured by any university ranking.

===Full-time bias===
League tables, which usually focus on the &quot;full-time&quot; undergraduate student experience, commonly omit reference to Birkbeck, University of London, and the Open University, both of which specialise in teaching part-time students. These universities, however, often make a strong showing in specialist league tables looking at research, teaching quality, and student satisfaction. In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, according to the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, Birkbeck was placed equal 33rd, and the Open University 43rd, out of 132 institutions. The 2009 student satisfaction survey placed the Open University 3rd and Birkbeck 13th out of 153 universities and higher education institutions (1st and 6th, respectively, among multi-faculty universities). In 2018, Birkbeck announced that it would withdraw from UK university rankings because their methodologies unfairly penalise it, since &quot;despite having highly-rated teaching and research, other factors caused by its unique teaching model and unrelated to its performance push it significantly down the ratings&quot;.
