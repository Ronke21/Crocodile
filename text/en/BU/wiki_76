<text>A splatter film is a subgenre of horror films that deliberately focuses on graphic portrayals of and graphic violence. These films, usually through the use of special effects, display a fascination with the vulnerability of the human body and the theatricality of its mutilation. The term &quot;splatter cinema&quot; was coined by George A. Romero to describe his film &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, though &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is generally considered by critics to have higher aspirations, such as social commentary, than to be simply exploitative for its own sake.

The term was popularized by John McCarty&#x27;s 1981 book &quot;Splatter Movies&quot;, subtitled: &quot;Breaking The Last Taboo: A Critical Survey of the Wildly Demented Sub Genre of the Horror Film that Is Changing the Face of Film Realism Forever&quot;. The first significant publication to attempt to define and analyse the &#x27;splatter film&#x27;, McCarty suggests that splatter is indicative of broader trends in film production. Though splatter is associated with fairly extreme horror films, and such works form the main focus of the book, a relatively diverse range of titles dating mainly from the 1960s to late 1970s are also included, for example John Waters&#x27; &quot;Female Trouble&quot;, Ted Post&#x27;s &quot;Magnum Force&quot;, Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, and Walter Hill&#x27;s Western &quot;The Long Riders&quot;. This filmography implies that the influence of film-makers such as Sam Peckinpah or Andy Warhol, to name two, is as significant to the development of the form as Grand Guignol, Hammer Films or Herschell Gordon Lewis.

During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the use of graphic violence in cinema has been labeled &quot;torture porn&quot; or &quot;gorno&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;gore&quot; and &quot;porno&quot;). By contrast, films such as &quot;Braindead&quot;, &quot;Evil Dead II&quot;, &quot;Idle Hands&quot;, and to some extent &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, all of which feature over-the-top gore, can be construed as comedic, and fall into the category of splatstick.

==Characteristics==
Splatter films, according to film critic Michael Arnzen, &quot;self-consciously revel in the special effects of gore as an artform.&quot; Where typical horror films deal with such fears as that of the unknown, the supernatural and the dark, the impetus for fear in a splatter film comes from physical destruction of the body and the pain accompanying it. There is also an emphasis on visuals, style and technique, including hyperactive camerawork. Where most horror films have a tendency to re-establish the social and moral order with good triumphing over evil, splatter films thrive on a lack of order. Arnzen argues that &quot;the spectacle of violence replaces any pretensions to narrative structure, because gore is the only part of the film that is reliably consistent.&quot; These films also often feature fragmented narratives and direction, including &quot;manic montages full of subject camera movement ... cross-cuttings from hunted to hunter, and ominous juxtapositions and contrasts.&quot;

==Origins==
The splatter film has its aesthetic roots in French Grand Guignol theatre, which endeavored to stage realistic scenes of blood and carnage for its patrons. In 1908, Grand Guignol made its first appearance in England, although the gore was downplayed in favor of a more Gothic tone, owing to the greater censorship of the arts in Britain.

The first appearance of gore—the realistic mutilation of the human body—in cinema can be traced to D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916), which features numerous Guignol-esque touches, including two onscreen decapitations, and a scene in which a spear is slowly driven through a soldier&#x27;s naked abdomen as blood wells from the wound. Several of Griffith&#x27;s subsequent films, and those of his contemporary Cecil B. DeMille, featured similarly realistic carnage.

===Modern era===
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the public was reintroduced to splatter themes and motifs by groundbreaking films such as Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) and the output of Hammer Film Productions (an artistic outgrowth of the English Grand Guignol style) such as &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; (1957) and &quot;Horror of Dracula&quot; (1958). Perhaps the most explicitly violent film of this era was Nobuo Nakagawa&#x27;s &quot;Jigoku&quot; (1960), which included numerous scenes of flaying and dismemberment in its depiction of the Buddhist underworld Naraka.

Splatter came into its own as a distinct subgenre of horror in the early 1960s with the films of Herschell Gordon Lewis in the United States. Eager to maintain a profitable niche, Lewis turned to something that mainstream cinema still rarely featured: scenes of visceral, explicit gore. In 1963, he directed &quot;Blood Feast&quot;, widely considered the first splatter film. In the 15 years following its release, &quot;Blood Feast&quot; took in an estimated $7 million. It was made for an estimated $24,500. &quot;Blood Feast&quot; was followed by two more gore films by Herschell Gordon Lewis, &quot;Two Thousand Maniacs!&quot; (1964) and &quot;Color Me Blood Red&quot; (1965).

The popularity of the splatter film in the 1970s was met with strong reactions in the US and the U.K. Roger Ebert in the U.S., and Member of Parliament Graham Bright in the U.K., led the charge to censor splatter films on home video with the film critic going after &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; while the politician sponsored the Video Recordings Act, a system of censorship and certification for home video in the U.K. This resulted in the outright banning of many splatter films, which were deemed &quot;video nasties&quot; in the British press.

Some splatter directors have gone on to produce mainstream hits. Peter Jackson started his career in New Zealand by directing the splatter movies &quot;Bad Taste&quot; (1987) and &quot;Braindead&quot; (1992). These films featured such over-the-top gore that it became a comedic device. These comedic gore films have been dubbed &quot;splatstick&quot;, defined as physical comedy that involves dismemberment. Splatstick seems to be more common in Japan, with the examples of &quot;Robogeisha&quot;, &quot;Tokyo Gore Police&quot;, and &quot;The Machine Girl&quot;.

Splatter films have pioneered techniques used in other genres. For example, the popular 1999 film &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; is similar to the 1980 film &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot;. The story in &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; is told through footage from a group of people making a documentary about a portion of the Amazon which is said to be populated by cannibals. Although the &quot;Blair Witch&quot; directors had not seen &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; at the time of filming, this &quot;mockumentary&quot; format was later used in their film.

One of the more recent examples of a splatter film is &quot;Terrifier&quot; (2016), and its sequels &quot;Terrifier 2&quot; (2022) and &quot;Terrifier 3&quot; (2024). All three films are infamous for their gore, two main examples being Dawn&#x27;s hacksaw kill in &quot;Terrifier&quot;, where Art the Clown saws Dawn in half, and Allie&#x27;s bedroom kill in &quot;Terrifier 2&quot;, where Art theatrically mutilates Allie to death. &quot;Terrifier 2&quot; was said to be so gory and so violent that audience members have reported to be vomiting and fainting.

===Torture porn===
In the 2000s—particularly 2003–2009—a body of films was produced that combined elements of the splatter and slasher film genres. The films were dubbed &quot;torture porn&quot; by critics and detractors, most notably by David Edelstein, who is thought to have coined the term. Like their splatter forerunners, torture porn films reputedly emphasize depictions of violence, gore, nudity, torture, mutilation and sadism. Also like splatter films, the extent to which torture porn lives up to its sensational reputation has been disputed.

Filmmaker Eli Roth&#x27;s &quot;Hostel&quot; (2005), released in January 2006, was the first to be called torture porn by critic Edelstein, but the classification has since been applied to &quot;Saw&quot; and its sequels (though its creators disagree with the classification), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; (2005), &quot;Wolf Creek&quot; (2005), and the earlier films &quot;Baise-moi&quot; (2000) and &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot; (2001). A difference between this group of films and earlier splatter films is that they are often mainstream Hollywood films that receive a wide release, and have comparatively high production values.

The torture porn subgenre has proven to be very profitable: &quot;Saw&quot;, made for $1.2 million, grossed over $100 million worldwide, while &quot;Hostel&quot;, which cost less than $5 million to produce, grossed over $80 million. Lionsgate, the studio behind the films, made considerable gains in its stock price from the box office showing. The financial success led the way for the release of similar films: &quot;Turistas&quot; in 2006, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Borderland&quot;, and &quot;Captivity&quot;, starring Elisha Cuthbert and Daniel Gillies, in 2007. Indeed, in 2009 the &quot;Saw&quot; series became the most profitable horror film series of all time,
prompting the release of &quot;The Collector&quot; starring Josh Stewart and Juan Fernández within that year.
Despite these financial successes, torture porn is perceived as a pejorative label by many press critics, filmmakers, and fans. &quot;Torture porn&#x27;s&quot; pejorative connotations were anchored by high-profile salacious advertising campaigns. Billboards and posters used in the marketing of &quot;Hostel: Part II&quot; and &quot;Captivity&quot; drew criticism for their graphic imagery, causing them to be taken down in many locations. Director Eli Roth sought to defend the subgenre, claiming that critics&#x27; uses of torture porn &quot;genuinely says more about the critic&#x27;s limited understanding of what horror movies can do than about the film itself&quot;, and that &quot;they&#x27;re out of touch.&quot; Horror author Stephen King defended &quot;Hostel: Part II&quot; and torture porn stating, &quot;sure it makes you uncomfortable, but good art should make you uncomfortable.&quot; Influential director George A. Romero stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t get the torture porn films ... they&#x27;re lacking metaphor.&quot;

The success of torture porn, and its boom during the mid to late 2000s, led to a crossover into genres other than horror. This became evident with the release of many crime thrillers, particularly the 2007 film &quot;I Know Who Killed Me&quot; starring Lindsay Lohan, and the 2008 film &quot;Untraceable&quot;, starring Diane Lane and Billy Burke. The British film &quot;WΔZ&quot;, starring Stellan Skarsgård and Selma Blair, and its US counterpart &quot;Scar&quot;, starring Angela Bettis and Ben Cotton, continued to facilitate this hybrid form of torture porn, which was also, to a lesser degree, evident in films such as &quot;Rendition&quot; (2007) starring Jake Gyllenhaal, &quot;Law Abiding Citizen&quot; (2009), and &quot;Unthinkable&quot; (2010) starring Samuel L. Jackson.

In the mid-2000s, the splatter film was given a major boost within the horror industry by a new wave of French films—commonly referred to as the New French Extremity—which became internationally known for their extremely brutal nature: &quot;Martyrs&quot; (2008), directed by Pascal Laugier, &quot;Frontier(s)&quot; (2007), directed by Xavier Gens, and &quot;Inside&quot; (2007), directed by Alexandre Bustillo and Julien Maury. Rapper Eminem explored the genre in his music video for the single &quot;3 a.m.&quot; that year. Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Antichrist&quot;, starring Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, was labeled torture porn by critics when it premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival due to scenes of extreme violence, graphic sex, and genital self-mutilation.

By 2009, the box office draw of torture porn films had mostly been replaced in the U.S. by the profitable trend of remaking or rebooting earlier horror films from decades past, with the modernization of films such as &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (2005), &quot;House of Wax&quot; (2005), &quot;Black Christmas&quot; (2006), &quot;Halloween&quot; (2007), &quot;My Bloody Valentine 3D&quot; (2009), &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (2009), &quot;The Wolfman&quot; (2010), &quot;The Crazies&quot; (2010), and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (2010). A number of these remakes, such as &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003), &quot;The Hills Have Eyes&quot; (2006) (and its sequel in 2007), &quot;Funny Games&quot; (2008), &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; (2009), and &quot;I Spit on Your Grave&quot; (2010) were referred to as torture porn in press reviews.

At the close of the decade, &quot;The Human Centipede (First Sequence)&quot; (2009) and &quot;A Serbian Film&quot; (2010) were among the most notable torture porn releases. Although not as financially successful as &quot;Saw&quot; or &quot;Hostel&quot;, &quot;A Serbian Film&quot; and &quot;The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)&quot; (2011) gained attention in the press for their graphic depictions of forced fecal consumption and necrophilia, and both films were censored in order to attain release in the U.K. Other torture porn films such as &quot;Murder-Set-Pieces&quot;, &quot;Grotesque&quot; and &quot;The Bunny Game&quot; were banned outright by the BBFC.

Subsequently, torture porn has increasingly become a DVD-oriented subgenre. For example, &quot;&quot; (2011) was released direct to DVD, unlike the previous films in the series. The film received less negative attention in the press as a result of its lower-profile release. Other recent torture porn films include &quot;Would You Rather&quot; (2012), &quot;The Collection&quot; (2012), &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; (2013), &quot;Who&#x27;s Watching Oliver&quot; (2018), &quot;Don&#x27;t Click&quot; (2020), &quot;Hacksaw&quot; (2020), and &quot;The Host&quot; (2020). As fewer and fewer high-profile cinematic torture porn films are being released, however, the subgenre is slowly dying out, as many journalists have proposed.

The genre elements were also used in episodes of many popular American television shows, including Fox&#x27;s &quot;24&quot;, CBS&#x27;s &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Dexter&quot;, The CW&#x27;s &quot;Supernatural&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Blindspot&quot; and FX&#x27;s &quot;American Horror Story&quot;.

Some scholars have published analyses of torture porn films. For example, a book chronicling the torture porn phenomenon and the surrounding controversy—Steve Jones&#x27; &quot;Torture Porn: Popular Horror after Saw&quot;—was published in 2013.

<doc id="604033" wikidata="Q316353" url="?curid=604033" title="Strato of Lampsacus">
<text>Strato of Lampsacus (; , – ) was a Peripatetic philosopher, and the third director (scholarch) of the Lyceum after the death of Theophrastus. He devoted himself especially to the study of natural science, and increased the naturalistic elements in Aristotle&#x27;s thought to such an extent, that he denied the need for an active god to construct the universe, preferring to place the government of the universe in the unconscious force of nature alone.

==Life==
Strato, son of Arcesilaus or Arcesius, was born in Lampsacus between 340 and 330 BCE. He might have known Epicurus during his period of teaching in Lampsacus between 310 and 306 BCE. He attended Aristotle&#x27;s school in Athens, after which he went to Egypt as tutor to Ptolemy II, where he also taught Aristarchus of Samos. He returned to Athens after the death of Theophrastus (c. 287 BCE), succeeding him as head of the Lyceum. He died sometime between 270 and 268 BCE.

Strato devoted himself especially to the study of natural science, whence he obtained the name of &quot;Physicus&quot; (). Cicero, while speaking highly of his talents, blames him for neglecting the most important part of philosophy, that which concerns virtue and morals, and giving himself up to the investigation of nature. In the long list of his works, given by Diogenes Laërtius, several of the titles are upon subjects of moral philosophy, but the great majority belong to the department of physical science. None of his writings survive, his views are known only from the fragmentary reports preserved by later writers.

==Philosophy==

Strato emphasized the need for exact research, and, as an example of this, he made use of the observation of how water pouring from a spout breaks into separate droplets as evidence that falling bodies accelerate.

Whereas Aristotle defined time as the numbered aspect of motion, Strato argued that because motion and time are continuous whereas number is discrete, time has an existence independent of motion, or simply that time was the quantitative aspect of motion, rather than its numerical aspect. Simplicius preserves the following quotation in his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot;: 

For we say we that we go abroad or sail or go on a military campaign or wage war for much time or for little time, and similarly, that we sit and sleep and do nothing for much time and for little time: for much time in the cases where the quantity is much, for little where it is little. For time is the quantitative in each of these. And this is why some people say that one and the same [thing] came slowly, others quickly, according to how the quantitative in this seems to each group. For we saw that that is quick in which the quantity from when it began to when it stopped is small, but much happened in this [interval]. Slow is the opposite, when the quantity in it is much, but what has been done is little. And for this reason, there is no quick and slow in rest, for all is equal to its own quantity, and neither much in a small quantity, or short in a large one. And this is why we speak of more and less time, but not of quicker or slower time. For an action and a motion can be quicker or slower, but the quantity in which the action is, is not quicker and slower, but more and less, like the time. Day and night, and month and year are not time or parts of time, but the former are light and dark, the latter the circuit of the moon and sun, while time is the quantity in which these are.

He was critical of Aristotle&#x27;s concept of place as a surrounding surface, preferring to see it as the space which a thing occupies. He also rejected the existence of Aristotle&#x27;s fifth element.

He emphasized the role of pneuma (&#x27;breath&#x27; or &#x27;spirit&#x27;) in the functioning of the soul; soul-activities were explained by pneuma extending throughout the body from the &#x27;ruling part&#x27; located in the head. All sensation is felt in the ruling-part of the soul, rather than in the extremities of the body; all sensation involves thought, and there is no thought not derived from sensation. He denied that the soul was immortal, and attacked the &#x27;proofs&#x27; put forward by Plato in his &quot;Phaedo&quot;.

Strato believed all matter consisted of tiny particles, but he rejected Democritus&#x27; theory of empty space. In Strato&#x27;s view, void does exist, but only in the empty spaces between imperfectly fitting particles; Space is always filled with some kind of matter. Such a theory permitted phenomena such as compression, and allowed the penetration of light and heat through apparently solid bodies.

He seems to have denied the existence of any god outside of the material universe, and to have held that every particle of matter has a plastic and seminal power, but without sensation or intelligence; and that life, sensation, and intellect, are but forms, accidents, and affections of matter. Cicero took exception to this:
Nor does his pupil Strato, who is called the natural philosopher, deserve to be listened to; he holds that all divine force is resident in nature, which contains, he says, the principles of birth, increase, and decay, but which lacks, as we could remind him, all sensation and form.

Like the atomists (Leucippus and Democritus) before him, Strato of Lampsacus was a materialist and believed that everything in the universe was composed of matter and energy. Strato was one of the first philosophers to formulate a secular worldview, in which God is merely the unconscious force of nature.

You deny that without God there can be anything: but here you yourself seem to go contrary to Strato of Lampsacus, who concedes to God a pardon from a great task. If the priests of God were on vacation, it is much more just that the Gods would also be on vacation; in fact he denies the need to appreciate the work of the Gods in order to construct the world. All the things that exist he teaches have been produced by nature; not hence, as he says, according to that philosophy which claims these things are made of rough and smooth corpuscles, indented and hooked, the void interfering; these, he upholds, are dreams of Democritus which are not to be taught but dreamt. Strato, in fact, investigating the individual parts of the world, teaches that all that which is or is produced, is or has been produced, by weight and motion. Thus he liberates God from a big job and me from fear.

Strato endeavoured to replace the Aristotelian teleology by a purely physical explanation of phenomena, the underlying elements of which he found in heat and cold, with especially heat as the active principle. Although Strato&#x27;s view of the universe can be seen as secular, he may have accepted the existence of gods within the universe, in the context of ancient Greek religion; it is unlikely that he would have regarded himself as an atheist.

==Geology==
As quoted from &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;:

Strabo passes on to the hypothesis of Strato, the natural philosopher, who had observed that the quantity of mud brought down by rivers into the Euxine was so great, that its bed must be gradually raised, while the rivers still continued to pour in an undiminished quantity of water. He therefore conceived that, originally, when the Euxine was an inland sea, its level had by this means become so much elevated that it burst its barrier near Byzantium, and formed a communication with the Propontis, and this partial drainage had already, he supposed, converted the left side into marshy ground, and that, at last, the whole would be choked up with soil. So, it was argued, the Mediterranean had once opened a passage for itself by the Columns of Hercules into the Atlantic, and perhaps the abundance of sea-shells in Africa, near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, might also be the deposit of some former inland sea, which had at length forced a passage and escaped.
Also following the reference of Georgius Agricola Strato of Lampsacus, the successor of Theophrastus, wrote a book on the subject of metallic arts called &quot;De Machinis Metallicis&quot;.

==Modern influence==
Strato&#x27;s name meant little in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. However, in the 17th century, his name suddenly became famous due to the supposed similarities between his system and the pantheistic views of Spinoza. In his 1678 attack on atheism, Ralph Cudworth designated Strato&#x27;s system as one of four types of atheism and in doing so, coined the term hylozoism to describe any system where primitive matter is endowed with a life force. These ideas reached Pierre Bayle, who adopted Strato and &#x27;Stratonism&#x27; as key components of his own philosophy. In his &quot;Continuation des Pensées diverses&quot;, published in 1705, Stratonism became the most important ancient equivalent of Spinozism. For Bayle, Strato had made everything to follow a fixed order of necessity, with no innate good or bad in the universe; the universe was not regarded as a living thing with intelligence or intent, and there is no other divine power but nature. As the third head of the Peripatetic School in Greece, Strato also taught Aristarchus of Samos, who went on to present the first known heliocentric model as an alternative hypothesis to the then-acknowledged model of geocentrism. The heliocentric model situated the Sun at the center of the universe, unlike geocentrism which placed the Earth at the center of the universe. This Aristarchus had a significant impact on philosophers and scientists during the Hellenistic era of philosophy and science, and also later scholars, namely Copernicus and Kepler.

<doc id="604034" wikidata="Q3052630" url="?curid=604034" title="Gauche caviar">
<text>Gauche caviar (&quot;Caviar left&quot;) is a pejorative French term to describe someone who claims to be a socialist while living in a way that contradicts socialist values. The expression is a political neologism dating from the 1980s and implies a degree of hypocrisy. The dictionary &quot;Petit Larousse&quot; defines &quot;left caviar&quot; as a pejorative expression for a &quot;Progressivism combined with a taste for society life and its accoutrements&quot;. One description referred to it as &quot;the free-thinking, authority-hating, individualistic, tolerant, socialist position... which shaded into a bohemian, existential, communitarian, fairly depressed&quot; worldview espoused by people with money and good clothes.

The concept is broadly similar to the English &quot;Champagne socialist&quot;, the American &quot;Limousine liberal&quot; or &quot;latte liberal&quot;, the German &quot;Salonkommunist&quot; or &quot;Champagnersozialist&quot;, the Dutch &quot;salonsocialist&quot;, the Italian &quot;Radical chic&quot;, the Polish &quot;kawiorowa lewica&quot;, the Portuguese &quot;esquerda caviar&quot;, the Spanish &quot;pijoprogre&quot;, the Argentinian Spanish &quot;zurdo con osde&quot;, the Chilean Spanish &quot;red set&quot;, the Peruvian Spanish &quot; Izquierda Caviar&quot; and the Danish &quot;Kystbanesocialist&quot;, referring to well-off coastal neighborhoods north of Copenhagen. Other similar terms in English include &quot;Hampstead liberal, liberal elite, chardonnay socialist,&quot; &quot;smoked salmon socialist&quot;, and &quot;Bollinger Bolshevik&quot;.

== Usage ==
The term was once prevalent in Parisian circles, applied deprecatingly to those who professed allegiance to the Socialist Party, but who maintained a far from proletarian lifestyle that distinguished them from the working-class base of the French Socialist Party. A more explicit reference identified this group as left-wingers who speak with great passion about the plight of the poor while eating caviar in their spectacular Parisian duplex apartment.

The label was also employed by detractors to describe François Mitterrand. This was further reinforced by the fact that several members of his administration were identified as part of the gauche caviar such as Jack Lang, who was the culture minister.

In early 2007, Ségolène Royal was identified with the &quot;gauche caviar&quot; when it was revealed that she had been avoiding paying taxes. The description damaged her campaign for the French presidency. Similarly French politician Bernard Kouchner and his wife Christine Ockrent have been labelled with the term. However, his appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs was not hampered by the label. Other supposed members of this &quot;gauche caviar&quot; include Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former IMF managing director, and his wife, the journalist Anne Sinclair, heiress to much of the fortune of her maternal grandfather, the art dealer Paul Rosenberg. It is said that around 2015, the &quot;gauche caviar&quot; supported also the Greek government of SYRIZA and PM Tsipras, &quot;desperate for a new &#x27;anti-imperialist hero&#x27; after Hugo Chavez&#x27;s death&quot;.

The weekly news magazine, &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot;, has been described as the &quot;quasi-official organ of France&#x27;s &#x27;gauche caviar&#x27;&quot;.

Regardless of whether &quot;gauche caviar&quot; is accepted by those given such label, politicians who fit this classification wield power in the French polity. For instance, during the administration of Mitterrand, a number of policies were adopted to avoid offending this group, which included the &quot;Gais pour la liberte&quot; (Gays for freedom).

<text>Scott Cain (born 2 April 1981) is an Australian singer and TV presenter. In 2002 he won the third Australian &quot;Popstars&quot; TV talent competition. His debut solo album, &quot;Controlled Folly&quot; (October 2002), peaked in the ARIA Albums Chart top 50. Its lead single, &quot;I&#x27;m Moving On&quot; (May 2002), reached number one on the related ARIA Singles Chart. While competing on &quot;Popstars&quot;, the Final 7 contestants released a compilation single with each providing a cover version of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Superstition&quot;, which peaked at number seven. His wife, Danielle Stearman, was a fellow contestant on &quot;Popstars&quot;, the couple have three children together. In 2024 they formed a local cover band together called MixTape Trio with another local musician.

== Biography ==

Scott Cain was born on 2 April 1981 and grew up in Port Macquarie. He attended Port Macquarie Primary School – where he was school captain in his final year – and then Port Macquarie High School where he completed Year 10. He also competed as a skateboarder.

By 2000 Cain was living in Perth where he worked as a furniture polisher and was also lead vocalist in a band, Funkapation. They released an album, &quot;Peanut Butter Brick&quot;, in 2000 and competed in the Hastings Valley Battle of the Bands earning Cain the award for Best Vocalist. Late in 2001 Cain auditioned for the Australian TV talent competition, &quot;Popstars&quot; third season. In March 2002 he entered the ARIA Singles Chart with his version of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Superstition&quot;, which was featured on a &quot;Popstars&quot; 3 The Final 7 compilation single – each contestant provided their own version of the track. It peaked at number seven and was certified gold for shipment of 35,000 copies by the end of the year. His first solo single, after winning the competition, was &quot;I&#x27;m Moving On&quot;, which debuted at number one in May and was also certified gold. His manager was Sloane Howard, the mother of The Kid Laroi.

Despite protest from Cain, his label, Warner Music Australasia, released his second single as &quot;Crazy People Rock&quot;, which peaked at number 39. Both of his initial singles were written by Gregg Alexander of the New Radicals. Cain had intended to release &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, co-written by himself with Nick Howard, as his second solo single but he was prevented by Warner. His debut album, &quot;Controlled Folly&quot;, reached number 49. He also released the non-album single &quot;Oceans in Between&quot;, a song based upon the events of 11 September 2001. This was a collaboration with Vents limited to 1,000 copies and released only through his website. Scott also performed this song at various charity events.

In 2003, he began hosting the &quot;AMTV&quot; show on the Disney Channel, and released the song &quot;Step into My World&quot; on a Roadshow compilation. He won Best New Talent at the 2004 ASTRA awards, beating out other finalists including James Mathieson and Andrew G ~ a public vote saw Scott Cain again win the public support for his role on AMTV Disney Channel take him home the award. The following year, Cain signed with ABC Kids and released his second album, &quot;Roller Coaster&quot; (October 2004). &quot;Perfect Day&quot; appeared on this album. Another album track, &quot;Hilary Duff&quot;, received radio airplay and later that year Cain supported the subject of the song, Hilary Duff, on her national Australian tour.

== Personal life ==

In 2002 Scott Cain started dating a fellow &quot;Popstars&quot; contestant, Danielle Stearman. Stearman also provided her version of &quot;Superstition&quot; for the compilation single and finished second in the contest. Stearman, as Danielle, released a solo single, &quot;Tell Me if You Like It&quot; (July 2002), which reached number 20 on the ARIA Singles chart. Cain and Stearman featured in a music video for the Australian band, The Millionaires, on their track, &quot;Wrong Guy&quot;, which Stearman co-wrote with their lead singer, Jordan Cade. Cain and Stearman issued a duet album, &quot;Spero&quot;, in 2009. In 2011, they got engaged and had a son. In 2015, they were married in Las Vegas and in 2017 had a daughter. In 2022 they welcomed another daughter. Cain now has four children – the first was born when he was 19. In 2024 they formed a local cover band called MixTape Trio with another local musician.

<doc id="604046" wikidata="Q424771" url="?curid=604046" title="Rosiglitazone">
<text>Rosiglitazone (trade name Avandia) is an antidiabetic drug in the thiazolidinedione class. It works as an insulin sensitizer, by binding to the PPAR in fat cells and making the cells more responsive to insulin. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a stand-alone drug or for use in combination with metformin or with glimepiride. First released in 1999, annual sales peaked at approximately $2.5-billion in 2006; however, following a meta-analysis in 2007 that linked the drug&#x27;s use to an increased risk of heart attack, sales plummeted to just $9.5-million in 2012. The drug&#x27;s patent expired in 2012.

It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 1999. Despite rosiglitazone&#x27;s effectiveness at decreasing blood sugar in type 2 diabetes mellitus, its use decreased dramatically as studies showed apparent associations with increased risks of heart attacks and death. Adverse effects alleged to be caused by rosiglitazone were the subject of over 13,000 lawsuits against GSK; as of July 2010, GSK had agreed to settlements on more than 11,500 of these suits.

Some reviewers recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market, but an FDA panel disagreed, and it remains available in the U.S. From November 2011 until November 2013, the federal government did not allow Avandia to be sold without a prescription from a certified doctor; moreover, patients were required to be informed of the risks associated with its use, and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies. In 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of a 2009 trial which failed to show increased heart attack risk.

In Europe, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended in September 2010 that the drug be suspended because the benefits no longer outweighed the risks. It was withdrawn from the market in the UK, Spain and India in 2010, and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011. 
==Medical uses==
Rosiglitazone was approved for glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes, as measured by glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as a surrogate endpoint, similar to that of other oral antidiabetic drugs. The controversy over adverse effects has dramatically reduced the use of rosiglitazone.

Published studies did not provide evidence that outcomes like mortality, morbidity, adverse effects, costs and health-related quality of life are positively influenced by rosiglitazone.

== Adverse effects ==

===Heart failure===
One of the safety concerns identified before approval was fluid retention. Moreover, the combination of rosiglitazone with insulin resulted in a higher rate of congestive heart failure. In Europe there were contraindications for use in heart failure and combination with insulin.

A meta analysis of all trials from 2010 and 2019 confirmed a higher risk of heart failure and a double risk when rosiglitazone was administered as add-on therapy to insulin. Two meta-analyses of real life cohort studies found a higher risk of heart failure compared to pioglitazone. There were 649 excess cases of heart failure every 100,000 patients who received rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone.

===Heart attacks===
The relative risk of ischemic cardiac events seen in pre-approval trials of rosiglitazone was similar to that of comparable drugs, but there was increased LDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides and weight.

In 2005, at the insistence of the World Health Organization, GSK performed a meta-analysis of all 37 trials involving use of rosiglitazone, finding a hazard ratio of 1.29 (0.99 to 1.89). 
In 2006 the GSK updated the analysis, now including 42 trials and showing a hazard ratio of 1.31 (1.01 to 1.70). A large observational study comparing patients treated with rosiglitizone with patients treated with other diabetes therapies was performed at the same time and found a relative risk of 0.93 (95% C.I. 0.8 to 1.1) for those treated with rosiglitazone. The information was passed to the FDA and posted on the company website, but not otherwise published. GSK provided these analyses to the FDA, but neither the company nor the FDA warned prescribers or patients of the hazard. According to the FDA, the Agency did not issue a safety bulletin because the results of the meta analysis conflicted with those of the observational study and with the results of the ADOPT trial.

A meta-analysis in May 2007 reported the use of rosiglitazone was associated with a 1.4 fold increased risk of heart attack and a numerically higher (but non-significant) increase in risk of death from all cardiovascular diseases against control. It contained 42 trials of which 27 were unpublished. Another meta analysis of 4 trials with follow-up longer than 1 year found similar results. Nissen&#x27;s meta analysis was criticized in a 2007 article by George Diamond &quot;et al.&quot; in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The authors concluded that Nissens&#x27; analysis had excluded trials with important data on the cardiovascular profile of rosiglitazone, had inappropriately combined trials of greatly differing design, and had inappropriately excluded trials with no cardiovascular events. The authors concluded that no firm conclusion could be drawn regarding whether rosiglitazone increased or decreased cardiovascular risk. Investigators from the Cochrane Collaboration published a meta-analysis of their own on the use of rosiglitazone in Type II diabetes, concluding there was not sufficient evidence to show any health benefit for rosiglitazone. Noting the recent publication by Nissen, they repeated their meta analysis including only the trials included in the Nissen study that dealt with Type II diabetics. (The Nissen study included some trials in people with other disorders.) They did not find a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events, but noted that all of the cardiovascular endpoints they analyzed showed a non-significant trend toward worse outcomes in the rosiglitazone arms.

In July 2007 the FDA held a joint meeting of the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. FDA scientist Joy Mele presented a meta analysis examining the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone in completed clinical trials. The study found an overall 1.4 fold increase in risk of cardiovascular ischemic events relative to the control arms. The results were heterogenous, with clear evidence of increased risk relative to placebo but not relative to other diabetes treatments and higher risk associated with combinations of rosiglitazone with insulin or metformin. Based on the 1.4 fold increased risk relative to control groups, FDA scientist David Graham presented an analysis suggesting that rosiglitazone had caused 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007. The advisory panel voted 20 : 3 that the evidence available indicated that rosiglitazone increased the risk of cardiovascular events and 22 : 1 that the overall risk:benefit ratio of rosiglitazone justified its continued marketing in the United States. The FDA placed restrictions on the drug, including adding a boxed warning about heart attacks, but did not withdraw it.

In 2000 a study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). GSK agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed that rosiglitazone was non-inferior to treatment with metformin or a sulfonylurea with respect to the rate of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death. European regulators concluded that due in part to design limitations, the results neither proved nor eliminated concerns of excess cardiovascular risk.

In February 2010, the FDA&#x27;s associate director of drug safety, recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market. In June 2010, they published a retrospective study comparing roziglitazone to pioglitazone, the other thiazolidinedione marketed in the United States and concluded rosiglitazone was associated with &quot;an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality and an increased risk of the composite of AMI, stroke, heart failure, or all-cause mortality in patients 65 years or older&quot;. The number needed to harm with roziglitazone was sixty. Graham argued rosiglitazone caused 500 more heart attacks and 300 more heart failures than its main competitor.

Two meta analyses released in 2010, one incorporating 56 trials and a second incorporating 164 trials reached conflicting conclusions. Nissen et al. found again an increased risk for heart infarction against control, but no increased risk for cardiovascular death. Mannucci et al. found no statistically significant increase in cardiac events but a significant increase in heart failure. A 2011 drug class review found an increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events.

A meta-analysis of 16 observational studies released in March, 2011, compared rosiglitazone to pioglitazone, finding support for greater cardiovascular safety for pioglitazone. The meta-analysis involved 810 000 patients taking rosiglitazone or pioglitazone. The study suggests 170 excess myocardial infarctions, 649 excess cases of heart failure, and 431 excess deaths for every 100 000 patients who receive rosiglitazone rather than pioglitazone. This was confirmed by another meta-analysis involving 945 286 patients in 8 retrospective cohort studies, most in the US.

In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for withholding the results of two studies of the cardiovascular safety of Avandia between 2001 and 2007.

===Death===
There was no difference in all cause and vascular death in a meta-analysis of 4 trials against controls. Two meta-analyses of cohort studies found excess deaths against pioglitazone.

===Stroke===
A retrospective observational study performed using Medicare data found that patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 27% higher risk of stroke compared to those treated with pioglitazone.

===Bone fractures===
GlaxoSmithKline reported a greater incidence of fractures of the upper arms, hands and feet in female diabetics given rosiglitazone compared with those given metformin or glyburide. 
The information was based on data from the ADOPT trial The same increase has been found with pioglitazone (Actos), another thiazolidinedione.

A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs, involving 13,715 patients and including both rosiglitazone- and pioglitazone-treated patients, showed an overall 45% increased risk of fracture with thiazolidone use compared with placebo or active comparator. It doubled the risk of fractures among women with type 2 diabetes, without a significant increase in risk of fractures among men with type 2 diabetes.

===Hypoglycaemia===
The risk of hypoglycaemia is reduced with thiazolidinediones when compared with sulfonylureas; the risk is similar to the risk with metformin (high strength of evidence).

===Weight gain===
Both thiazolidinediones cause a similar degree of weight gain to that caused by sulfonylureas (moderate strength of evidence).

===Eye damage===
Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been suspected of causing macular edema, which damages the retina of the eye and causes partial blindness. Blindness is also a possible effect of diabetes, which rosiglitazone is intended to treat. One report documented several occurrences and recommended discontinuation at the first sign of vision problems. A retrospective cohort study showed an association between the use of thiazolidinediones and the incidence of diabetic macular edema (DME). Both use was associated with a 2,3 higher risk at 1 year and at 10 year follow-up, rising to 3 if associated with insulin.

===Hepatotoxicity===
Moderate to severe acute hepatitis has occurred in several adults who had been taking the drug at the recommended dose for two to four weeks. Plasma rosiglitazone concentrations may be increased in people with existing liver problems.

===Contraindications===
Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are contraindicated in people with NYHA Class III and IV heart failure. They are not recommended for use in heart failure.

In Europe rosiglitazone was contraindicated for heart failure or history of heart failure with regard to all NYHA stages, for combined use with insulin and for acute coronary syndrome. The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market.

==Pharmacology==

Rosiglitazone is a member of the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. Thiazolidinediones act as insulin sensitizers. They reduce glucose, fatty acid, and insulin blood concentrations. They work by binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). PPARs are transcription factors that reside in the nucleus and become activated by ligands such as thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones enter the cell, bind to the nuclear receptors, and alter the expression of genes. The several PPARs include PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ. Thiazolidinediones bind to PPARγ.

PPARs are expressed in fat cells, cells of the liver, muscle, heart, and inner wall (endothelium) and smooth muscle of blood vessels. PPARγ is expressed mainly in fat tissue, where it regulates genes involved in fat cell (adipocyte) differentiation, fatty acid uptake and storage, and glucose uptake. It is also found in pancreatic beta cells, vascular endothelium, and macrophages Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ and has no PPARα-binding action. Other drugs bind to PPARα.

Rosiglitazone also appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect in addition to its effect on insulin resistance. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), a signaling molecule, stimulates the inflammatory pathways. NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) downregulates the inflammatory pathways. When patients take rosiglitazone, NF-κB levels fall and IκB levels increase.

==History==
Rosiglitazone was approved by the US FDA in 1999 and by the EMA in 2000; the EMA however required two postmarketing studies on longterm adverse effects, one for chronic heart failure and the other for cardiovascular effects.

==Society and culture==

===Sales===
US sales of the drug were of $2.2 billion in 2006. Sales in 2Q 2007 down 22% compared to 2006. 4Q 2007 sales down to $252 million.

Though sales have gone down since 2007 due to safety concerns, Avandia sales for 2009 totalled $1.2 billion worldwide.

===Lawsuits===
According to analysts from UBS, 13,000 suits had been filed by March 2010. Included among those suing: Santa Clara County, California, which claims to have spent $2 million on rosiglitazone between 1999 and 2007 at its public hospital and is asking for &quot;triple damages&quot;.
In May 2010, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) reached settlement agreements for some of the cases against the company, agreeing to pay $60 million to resolve 700 suits. In July 2010, GSK reached settlement agreements to close another 10,000 of the lawsuits against it, agreeing to pay about $460 million to settle these suits. 
In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department announced GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $3 billion fine, in part for withholding the results of two studies of the cardiovascular safety of Avandia between 2001 and 2007. The settlement stems from claims made by four employees of GlaxoSmithKline, including a former senior marketing development manager for the company and a regional vice president, who tipped off the government about a range of improper practices from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s.

====United States investigations====

GlaxoSmithKline was being investigated by the FDA and the US Congress regarding Avandia.

Senators Democrat Max Baucus and Republican Charles Grassley filed a report urging GSK to withdraw Avandia in 2008 due to the side effects. The report noted the drug caused 500 avoidable heart attacks a month, and Glaxo officials sought to intimidate doctors who criticized the drug. It also said GSK continued to sell and promote the drug despite knowing the increased risk of heart attacks and stroke.

The Senate Finance Committee, in a panel investigation, revealed emails from GSK company officials that suggest the company downplayed scientific findings about safety risks dating back to 2000. It was also alleged by the committee that the company initiated a &quot;ghostwriting campaign&quot;, whereby GSK sought outside companies to write positive articles about Avandia to submit to medical journals. GSK defended itself by presenting data that its own tests found Avandia to be safe, although an FDA staff report showed the conclusions were flawed.

On July 14, 2010, after two days of extensive deliberations, the FDA panel investigating Avandia came to a mixed vote. Twelve members of the panel voted to take the drug off the market, 17 recommended to leave it on but with a more revised warning label, and three voted to keep it on the market with the current warning label. The panel has come to some controversy, however; on July 20, 2010, one of the panelists was discovered to have been a paid speaker for GlaxoSmithKline, arousing questions of a conflict of interest. This panel member was one of the three who voted to keep Avandia on the market with no additional warning labels.

In 2011 the FDA has decided on revising its prescribing information and medication guides for all rosilitazone containing medicines. The US label for rosiglitazone (Avandia, GlaxoSmithKline) and all rosiglitazone-containing medications (Avandamet and Avandaryl) now include the additional safety information and restrictions. The revised labels restrict use to patients already taking a rosiglitazone-containing medicine or to new patients who are unable to achieve adequate glycemic control on other diabetes medications and to those, who in consultation with their healthcare provider, have decided not to take Actos (pioglitazone) or other pioglitazone-containing medicines for medical reasons.

In June 2013 an FDA Advisory Committee reviewed all available data, including a re-adjudicated RECORD trial, found no evidence of increased cardiovascular risk with Avandia, and voted to remove the restrictions on Avandia marketing in the United States. In November 2013, the US FDA removed these marketing restrictions on the product. Under the FDA&#x27;s instruction, Avandia&#x27;s maker, GlaxoSmithKline, had funded the Duke Clinical Research Institute to re-analyze the raw data from the study. At the 2010 panel, three panelists voted that the existing warnings were good enough; two were back in 2013. Seven voted to make those warnings more onerous, and five of them returned. But of the 10 who voted to restrict Avandia&#x27;s use, only four returned. And of the 12 who voted in 2010 to withdraw Avandia from the market, only three came back.

====European investigations====
In 2000 a study to address the concerns regarding cardiovascular safety was requested by the EMA, and the makers agreed to perform post-marketing a long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality study in patients on rosiglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea or metformin: the RECORD study. The results as published in 2009 showed non-inferiority with regard to cardiovascular events and cardiovascular death when the treatment with rosiglitazone was compared with metformin or a sulfonylurea. For myocardial infarction, there was a non-statistically significant increase in risk. In their assessment, the European regulators acknowledged weaknesses of the study, such as an unexpectedly low rate of cardiovascular events and the open-label design, which may lead to reporting bias. They found that the results were inconclusive. The European Medicines Agency recommended on 23 September 2010 that Avandia be suspended from the European market.

According to a probe by the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in September 2010, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Commission on Human Medicines recommended to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) back in July 2010, to withdraw Avandia sale because its &quot;risks outweigh its benefits&quot;. Additionally, the probe revealed that in 2000, members of the European panel in charge of reviewing Avandia prior to its approval had concerns about the long-term risks of the drug.

====New Zealand ====
Rosiglitazone was withdrawn from the New Zealand market April 2011 because Medsafe concluded the suspected cardiovascular risks of the medicine for patients with type 2 diabetes outweigh its benefits.

====South Africa====
A notice issued by the Medicines Control Council of South Africa on July 5, 2011, stated that it had resolved on July 3, 2011, to withdraw all rosiglitazone-containing medicines from the South African market due to safety risks. It disallowed all new prescriptions of Avandia.

===Controversy and response===
Following the reports in 2007 that Avandia can significantly increase the risk of heart attacks, the drug has been controversial. A 2010 article in &quot;Time&quot; uses the Avandia case as evidence of a broken FDA regulatory system that &quot;may prove criminal as well as fatal&quot;. It details the disclosure failures, adding, &quot;Congressional reports revealed that GSK sat on early evidence of the heart risks of its drug, and that the FDA knew of the dangers months before it informed the public.&quot; It reports, &quot;the FDA is investigating whether GSK broke the law by failing to fully inform the agency of Avandia&#x27;s heart risks&quot;, according to deputy FDA commissioner Dr. Joshua Sharfstein. GSK threatened academics who reported adverse research results, and received multiple warning letters from the FDA for deceptive marketing and failure to report clinical data. The maker of the drug, GlaxoSmithKline, has dealt with serious backlash against the company for the drug&#x27;s controversy. Sales on the drug dropped significantly after the story first broke in 2007, dropping from $2.5 billion in 2006 to less than $408 million in 2009 in the US.
In response to the rise in risk of heart attacks, the Indian government ordered GSK to suspend its research study, called TIDE, in 2010. The FDA also halted the TIDE study in the United States.

Three doctors&#x27; groups, the Endocrine Society, the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, urged patients to continue to take the drug as it would be much worse to stop all treatment, despite any associated risk, but that patients could consult their doctors and begin a switch to a different drug if they or their doctors find concern. The American Heart Association said in a statement in June 2010: &quot; ...the reports deserves serious consideration, and patients with diabetes who are 65 years of age or older and being treated with rosiglitazone should discuss the findings with their prescribing physician...&quot;. 
&quot;For patients with diabetes, the most serious consequences are heart disease and stroke, and the risk of suffering from them is significantly increased when diabetes is present. As in most situations, patients should not change or stop medications without consulting their healthcare provider.&quot;

==Research==
Rosiglitazone was thought to be able to benefit patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease who do not express the ApoE4 allele, but the phase III trial designed to test this showed that rosiglitazone was ineffective in all patients, including ApoE4-negative patients.

Rosiglitazone may also treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, due to its anti-inflammatory properties as a PPAR ligand.

Rosiglitazone has been investigated as an agent that may expedite body fat redistribution into a more feminine shape in trans women who have had little fat redistribution from hormone replacement therapy, due to thiozolidinediones&#x27; effects on body fat metabolism.

<doc id="604052" wikidata="Q137885" url="?curid=604052" title="Schinzel's hypothesis H">
<text>In mathematics, Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis H is one of the most famous open problems in the topic of number theory. It is a very broad generalization of widely open conjectures such as the twin prime conjecture. The hypothesis is named after Andrzej Schinzel. 
==Statement==
The hypothesis claims that for every finite collection formula_1 of nonconstant irreducible polynomials over the integers with positive leading coefficients, one of the following conditions holds:

# There are infinitely many positive integers formula_2 such that all of formula_3 are simultaneously prime numbers, or
# There is an integer formula_4 (called a &quot;fixed divisor&quot;), which depends on the polynomials, which always divides the product formula_5. (Or, equivalently: There exists a prime formula_6 such that for every formula_2 there is an formula_8 such that formula_6 divides formula_10.)

The second condition is satisfied by sets such as formula_11, since formula_12 is always divisible by 2. It is easy to see that this condition prevents the first condition from being true. Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis essentially claims that condition 2 is the only way condition 1 can fail to hold.

No effective technique is known for determining whether the first condition holds for a given set of polynomials, but the second one is straightforward to check: Let formula_13 and compute the greatest common divisor of formula_14 successive values of formula_15. One can see by extrapolating with finite differences that this divisor will also divide all other values of formula_15 too.

Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis builds on the earlier Bunyakovsky conjecture, for a single polynomial, and on the Hardy–Littlewood conjectures and Dickson&#x27;s conjecture for multiple linear polynomials. It is in turn extended by the Bateman–Horn conjecture.

===Examples===
As a simple example with formula_17,

:formula_18

has no fixed prime divisor. We therefore expect that there are infinitely many primes

:formula_19

This has not been proved, though. It was one of Landau&#x27;s conjectures and goes back to Euler, who observed in a letter to Goldbach in 1752 that formula_19 is often prime for formula_21 up to 1500.

As another example, take formula_22 with formula_23 and formula_24. The hypothesis then implies the existence of infinitely many twin primes, a basic and notorious open problem.

===Variants===
As proved by Schinzel and Sierpiński 
it is equivalent to the following: if condition 2 does not hold, then there exists at least one positive integer formula_21 such that all formula_26 will be simultaneously prime, for any choice of irreducible integral polynomials formula_27 with positive leading coefficients.

If the leading coefficients were negative, we could expect negative prime values; this is a harmless restriction.

There is probably no real reason to restrict polynomials with integer coefficients, rather than integer-valued polynomials (such as formula_28, which takes integer values for all integers formula_29 even though the coefficients are not integers).

==Previous results==
The special case of a single linear
polynomial is Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions, one of the most important results of
number theory. In fact, this special case is the only known instance of Schinzel&#x27;s Hypothesis H. We do not
know the hypothesis to hold for any given polynomial of degree greater than formula_30, nor for any system of
more than one polynomial.

Almost prime approximations to Schinzel&#x27;s Hypothesis have been attempted by many mathematicians; among them, most notably,
Chen&#x27;s theorem states that there exist infinitely many prime numbers formula_2 such that formula_32 is either a prime or a semiprime 
and Iwaniec proved that there exist infinitely many integers formula_2 for which formula_34 is either a prime or a semiprime. Skorobogatov and Sofos have proved that almost all polynomials of any fixed degree satisfy Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis H. 

Let formula_35 be an integer-valued polynomial with common factor formula_36, and let formula_37. Then formula_38 is an primitive integer-valued polynomial. Ronald Joseph Miech proved using Brun sieve that formula_39 infinitely often and therefore formula_40 infinitely often, where formula_2 runs over positive integers. The numbers formula_42 and formula_43 don&#x27;t depend on formula_2, and formula_45, where formula_46 is the degree of the polynomial formula_38. This theorem is also known as Miech&#x27;s theorem. The proof of the Miech&#x27;s theorem uses Brun sieve.

If there is a hypothetical probabilistic density sieve, using the Miech&#x27;s theorem can prove the Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis H in all cases by mathematical induction.

==Prospects and applications==

The hypothesis is probably not accessible with current methods in analytic number theory, but is now quite often used to prove conditional results, for example in Diophantine geometry. This connection is due to Jean-Louis Colliot-Thélène and Jean-Jacques Sansuc. For further explanations and references on this connection
see the notes of Swinnerton-Dyer. 
The conjectural result being so strong in nature, it is possible that it could be shown to be too much to expect.

==Extension to include the Goldbach conjecture==

The hypothesis does not cover Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture, but a closely related version (hypothesis HN) does. That requires an extra polynomial formula_48, which in the Goldbach problem would just be formula_49, for which

:&quot;N&quot; − &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)

is required to be a prime number, also. This is cited in Halberstam and Richert, &quot;Sieve Methods&quot;. The conjecture here takes the form of a statement &quot;when N is sufficiently large&quot;, and subject to the condition that 

:formula_50

has no fixed divisor &gt; 1. Then we should be able to require the existence of &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;N&quot; − &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is both positive and a prime number; and with all the &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) prime numbers.

Not many cases of these conjectures are known; but there is a detailed quantitative theory (see Bateman–Horn conjecture).

==Local analysis==

The condition of having no fixed prime divisor is purely local (depending just on primes, that is). In other words, a finite set of irreducible integer-valued polynomials 
with no local obstruction to taking infinitely many prime values is conjectured to take infinitely many prime values.

==An analogue that fails==

The analogous conjecture with the integers replaced by the one-variable polynomial ring over a finite field is false. For example, Swan noted in 1962 (for reasons unrelated to Hypothesis H) that the polynomial

:formula_51

over the ring &quot;F&quot;2[&quot;u&quot;] is irreducible and has no fixed prime polynomial divisor (after all, its values at &quot;x&quot; = 0 and &quot;x&quot; = 1 are relatively prime polynomials) but all of its values as &quot;x&quot; runs over &quot;F&quot;2[&quot;u&quot;] are composite. Similar examples can be found with &quot;F&quot;2 replaced by any finite field; the obstructions in a proper formulation of Hypothesis H over &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;], where &quot;F&quot; is a finite field, are no longer just local but a new global obstruction occurs with no classical parallel, assuming hypothesis H is in fact correct.

<text>Richard Lee Rudd (born September 12, 1956), nicknamed &quot;the Rooster&quot;, is an American former racing driver and racing team owner. He is the uncle of actor Skeet Ulrich and former NASCAR Busch Series driver Jason Rudd. He retired in 2007 with 23 career wins; twenty were done in a span from 1983 to 1998, where he won at least one race in sixteen consecutive seasons, a mark only surpassed by three other drivers. He was named the 2006 Virginian of the Year and was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. In October 2010, he was selected to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame, which honors those who have contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia.

==Career==

===Early life===
Rudd was born in South Norfolk, Virginia (now Chesapeake), the son of Margaret (née McMannen) and Alvin R. Rudd Sr., the president of Al Rudd Auto Parts. He began racing as a teenager in karting and motocross, but did not attempt stock car racing until he was eighteen years old, when he made his NASCAR debut at North Carolina Speedway in 1975, driving the No. 10 Ford for family friend Bill Champion.

Qualifying 26th, he finished in 11th place despite running 46 laps down. He then ran an additional three races for Champion, his best finish being a tenth at Bristol Motor Speedway. He drove another four races in 1976 for his father, posting another tenth finish at the Firecracker 400. He went full-time in 1977, again driving the No. 22 for his father. He had ten Top 10 finishes and was named Rookie of the Year. Rudd ran part-time the following season. Despite the abbreviated schedule, he earned four top-tens and finished 31st in points. In 1979, he signed with Junie Donlavey to pilot the No. 90 Truxmore-sponsored car, garnering four Top 5’s and a ninth-place finish in the final points standings.

He did not return to Donlavey in 1980, and started out in a part-time run for his dad and D. K. Ulrich. He finished season in the No. 7 Sanyo-sponsored car for Nelson Malloch, for whom he had one tenth-place finish.

===1981–1987===
In 1981, Rudd signed with DiGard Motorsports to drive the No. 88 car. Although he had no victories, he won his first three pole positions, and began his lengthy streak of consecutive race starts. In 1982 Rudd stepped into the No. 3 Pontiac for Richard Childress Racing. Rudd had six Top 5s but dropped down to ninth in the points standings. In the 1983 Daytona 500, Rudd became the youngest pole winner in Daytona 500 history at the age of 26 and would hold that record until 2014 when it was broken by a 23 year old Austin Dillon. He was able to get his first two career wins in 1983 at Riverside and Martinsville respectively, but he again finished ninth in points. He also ran the only three Busch Series races of his career that season, winning in his debut event at Dover Downs.

In 1984, Rudd and Dale Earnhardt swapped rides, with Rudd moving over to the No. 15 Ford for Bud Moore. The move came after Earnhardt signed with Childress, leaving Rudd disappointed and out of a ride until he drove for Moore. Rudd was involved in a horrific crash in the Busch Clash at Daytona, in which his car went airborne (in a crash that Ned Jarrett described as something like a &quot;bucking horse&quot;) before suffering a concussion and a torn cartilage in his rib cage. His eyes were swollen so badly he taped his eyes open to be able to race in the Daytona 500, as well as a flak jacket for his rib injury. After learning of this long after the fact, NASCAR instituted the policy of examining all drivers involved in wrecks to ensure that they will be able to race safely the next week. He won his first race for this team in only his second start at Richmond and improved to seventh in points. He moved up one spot in points in the following season, and then a career-best 5th-place finish in 1986. Despite an additional 2 victories in 1987, Rudd left Moore Engineering at the end of the season.

===1988–1993===

Rudd joined King Racing beginning in 1988 in the No. 26 Buick Regal owned by drag racing legend Kenny Bernstein. He struggled with engine failures all season long and finished 11th in the point standings, his worst points finish in eight years. In addition, Rudd suffered a knee injury in a crash at The Winston. At North Wilkesboro, Rudd was fined $10,000 for actions detrimental to stock car racing after spinning Dale Earnhardt late in the race. After his only win of 1989, which came at the inaugural Sears Point event, Rudd departed the operation. He tangled with Earnhardt again at North Wilkesboro, as a last-lap altercation while fighting for the lead handed the win to Geoff Bodine. In 1990, Rudd signed with Hendrick Motorsports to drive the No. 5 Chevrolet Lumina. He was able to win The Bud at the Glen and finished seventh in the point standings. However, he was involved in a fatal pit road accident in the season-finale Atlanta Journal 500, in which he spun into Bill Elliott&#x27;s pit and accidentally crushed Elliott&#x27;s tire changer Mike Rich, who died hours later in surgery. That fatal incident caused NASCAR to implement pit road speed limits at every NASCAR track, for all of the series.

In 1991, Rudd won his only race of the year at Darlington Raceway. Later in the year at Sonoma, Rudd was the center of controversy in one of the most bizarre finishes in NASCAR. Rudd started on pole at the race, and was offered a bonus paycheck with the winning money if he won the race. Rudd took the second spot with 3 laps left, and when the white flag was waved Rudd tapped Davey Allison to take the lead. When Rudd came back around to the finish line he waved to his pit crew but was shown a black flag for the tap. His win was taken away and given to Allison who refired to end up in second place. Rudd ended up in second place; Rick Hendrick, and crew chief Waddell Wilson unsuccessfully tried to appeal the penalties.

He finished the year a career-best 2nd-place finish in points. The following season, he won the Peak Antifreeze 500, but dropped to seventh in points. After finishing another three spots lower in points in 1993, he left Hendrick to start his own racing corporation Rudd Performance Motorsports.

===1994–1999===

Rudd took Tide and formed his own race team in 1994, Rudd Performance Motorsports, and drove the No. 10 Ford Thunderbird that season. His first win as an owner/driver came at New Hampshire International Speedway, which led to a fifth-place points finish. 1995 saw his consecutive winning streak almost end before he won the Dura Lube 500 at Phoenix, the second-to-last race of the season. He had another near miss in 1996, but won late in the year at North Carolina Speedway.

In 1997, Rudd had two wins, one in the Brickyard 400 and the other at Dover International Speedway, making this his highest win total since 1987, but he dropped to 17th in the points standings, making this the first time he finished outside of the Top 10 in nine years. His only win in 1998 came at Martinsville Speedway, dealing with high air temperatures and a faulty cooling system. As a result, Rudd suffered burns and blisters over most of his body, and gave his victory lane interview lying on the ground breathing from an oxygen mask. This was the last win of his consecutive victory streak, as he struggled with mechanical failures and wrecks throughout the season. With 16 winning seasons in a row, he nonetheless broke a new record that still stands today, though Jimmie Johnson managed to tie it in 2017. The following year, Rudd failed to win a race, snapping a 16-season streak with at least one victory. When Tide left his team, Rudd chose to liquidate his equipment and close his team.

===2000–2005===
After many rumors and speculation, Rudd was hired to pilot the No. 28 Texaco/Havoline-sponsored Ford Taurus for Robert Yates Racing in 2000. Although he still did not win any races that season, he did have two poles and moved to fifth in the points standings, a 26-spot improvement over the previous season. In 2001, Rudd got his first win in three years at Pocono, followed by another win at Richmond late in the season. He also matched a career-high 14 top-five finishes. Rudd scored his final win at Sonoma in 2002, but dropped to 10th in points. Following the fall Richmond race, Rudd had a heated argument with RYR engine specialist Larry Lackey on pit road, with Lackey punching Rudd in the face and Rudd retaliating with a water bottle. Rudd was fined 5,000 and placed on probation while Lackey was fined 10,000 before resigning from his position at RYR. Rudd left RYR at the end of the 2002 season.

In 2003, Rudd signed to drive the No. 21 Ford for Wood Brothers Racing, replacing Elliott Sadler, who took over Rudd&#x27;s seat at RYR. Rudd scored four top-fives and a 23rd-place finish in points that year. The following year, he won his final career pole at Talladega, but fell a spot in the standings. He was able to recover to earn nine top 10s in 2005 and improved to 21st in points. The closest he came to winning a race between 2003 and 2005 was at Sonoma in 2005, when he led several laps and finished second to Tony Stewart after being passed by him with nine laps to go.

At the end of the 2005 season, Rudd left the No. 21 team and announced he would &quot;take a break from racing&quot;, although he was not retiring. At the time he was known as NASCAR&#x27;s &quot;ironman&quot;, or record holder for most consecutive starts, ending at 788, and holding the record until it was surpassed by Jeff Gordon in 2015.

===2006–2007===

Rudd spent most of 2006 out of racing, racing only at Dover, where he filled in for an ailing Tony Stewart. He made an appearance to meet and sign autographs for fans at the 2006 Carl Casper&#x27;s Custom Auto Show at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky and meanwhile, he also raced in a karting event called the RoboPong 200 in Newcastle, Indiana in a race full of IndyCar stars, and eventually etching his name on the Dan Wheldon Cup, the trophy that since 2012 has become that event&#x27;s signature trophy. Late in the season, his return to Yates was announced, to drive the No. 88 Ford full-time. His best finish since his return to the sport was seventh in the Coca-Cola 600. Since he missed the Chevy Rock &amp; Roll 400, it was the first time in his career where he did not make a start due to an injury. Kenny Wallace drove the No. 88 on an interim basis until Rudd healed, except at Talladega, where Mike Wallace drove the car. Rudd made his return at Charlotte, where he finished 11th. He finished his career with a 21st-place finish at the Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami.

==After racing==
After the 2007 season, and a 32-year career, Rudd resides at his home in Cornelius, North Carolina. In 2007, Rudd was inducted into the 2007 Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and in 2010, he was selected to the Hampton Roads Sports Hall of Fame that honors those who have contributed to sports in southeastern Virginia. Rudd now lives what he calls &quot;a very simple lifestyle&quot; with his family. On February 7, 2012, Rudd signed to be an analyst for Speed Channel&#x27;s weekend motor sports news program, &quot;SPEED Center&quot;. Following the announcement he said, &quot;I&#x27;m really looking forward to the next chapter. It’s going to be a lot of fun working with the gang at SPEED.&quot; In 2013, Rudd made appearances in Series Two of the TV show &quot;Dallas&quot; in scenes filmed at Texas Motor Speedway as the hired driver for Christopher Ewing&#x27;s methane-powered race car.

On February 17, 2014, Rudd was inducted into the Daytona Beach Stock car Hall of Fame by Rotary International.

Even though he retired from professional racing, Rudd still races go-karts at GoPro Motorplex in the Charlotte area.

<text>The endocardium (: endocardia) is the innermost layer of tissue that lines the chambers of the heart. Its cells are embryologically and biologically similar to the endothelial cells that line blood vessels. The endocardium also provides protection to the valves and heart chambers.

The endocardium underlies the much more voluminous myocardium, the muscular tissue responsible for the contraction of the heart. The outer layer of the heart is termed epicardium and the heart is surrounded by a small amount of fluid enclosed by a fibrous sac called the pericardium.

==Function== 
The endocardium, which is primarily made up of endothelial cells, controls myocardial function. This modulating role is separate from the homeometric and heterometric regulatory mechanisms that control myocardial contractility. Moreover, the endothelium of the myocardial (heart muscle) capillaries, which is also closely appositioned to the cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), is involved in this modulatory role. Thus, the cardiac endothelium (both the endocardial endothelium and the endothelium of the myocardial capillaries) controls the development of the heart in the embryo as well as in the adult, for example during hypertrophy. Additionally, the contractility and electrophysiological environment of the cardiomyocyte are regulated by the cardiac endothelium.

The endocardial endothelium may also act as a kind of blood–heart barrier (analogous to the blood–brain barrier), thus controlling the ionic composition of the extracellular fluid in which the cardiomyocytes bathe.

==Clinical significance==
In myocardial infarction, ischemia of the myocardium starts at the endocardium and might extend up to the epicardium, disrupting the entire heart wall (&quot;transmural&quot; infarction). Less extensive infarctions are often &quot;subendocardial&quot; and do not affect the epicardium. In the acute setting, subendocardial infarctions are more dangerous than transmural infarctions because they create an area of dead tissue surrounded by a boundary region of damaged myocytes. This damaged region will conduct impulses more slowly, resulting in irregular rhythms. The damaged region may enlarge or extend and become more life-threatening. In the chronic setting, transmural infarctions are more dangerous due to the greater amount of muscular damage and the development of scar tissue leading to impaired systolic contractility, impaired diastolic relaxation, and increased risk for rupture and thrombus formation.
During depolarization the impulse is carried from endocardium to epicardium, and during repolarization the impulse moves from epicardium to endocardium.
In infective endocarditis, the &quot;endocardium&quot; (especially the endocardium lining the heart valves) is affected by bacteria.

<text>Bjarte Flem (born 30 March 1958) is a former Norwegian football goalkeeper. He played for the Norwegian football club Tromsø, as well as Lillestrøm and Fyllingen.

He was immortalized for his mistake during a match against Sogndal in 1988, which was shown live on the only television station at the time. As Flem was about to throw the ball to a defender on his own team, he threw the ball into his own goal instead. While he was swinging his arm to throw the ball, he changed his mind when he figured out that his teammate was man-marked, resulting in that he let the ball go when he was aiming towards his own goal. The incident made the front pages of national newspapers the next day, and was shown on television in countries across the globe. In Norway, the name Bjarte Flem has become eponymous for a goalkeeper making a huge mistake.

Even though Bjarte Flem mainly will be remembered for his huge mistake, he was also a good goalkeeper, who enjoyed many good seasons in Tromsø before he retired. Two years before the incident, Tromsø played in the Norwegian Cup Final and won their second Norwegian Cup Championship, with Flem as their goalkeeper.

Before his footballing career he worked as a fisherman, and returned to this job later.

<text>Verbal Behavior is a 1957 book by psychologist B. F. Skinner, in which he describes what he calls verbal behavior, or what was traditionally called linguistics. Skinner&#x27;s work describes the controlling elements of verbal behavior with terminology invented for the analysis - &quot;echoics, mands, tacts, autoclitics&quot; and others - as well as carefully defined uses of ordinary terms such as &quot;audience&quot;.

== Origins ==
The origin of &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; was an outgrowth of a series of lectures first presented at the University of Minnesota in the early 1940s and developed further in his summer lectures at Columbia and William James lectures at Harvard in the decade before the book&#x27;s publication.

== Research ==
Skinner&#x27;s analysis of verbal behavior drew heavily on methods of literary analysis. This tradition has continued. The book &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; is almost entirely theoretical, involving little experimental research in the work itself. Many research papers and applied extensions based on &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; have been done since its publication.
==Functional analysis==
Skinner&#x27;s &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; also introduced the autoclitic and six elementary operants: mand, tact, audience relation, echoic, textual, and intraverbal. For Skinner, the proper object of study is &quot;behavior itself&quot;, analyzed without reference to hypothetical (mental) structures, but rather with reference to the functional relationships of the behavior in the environment in which it occurs. This analysis extends Ernst Mach&#x27;s pragmatic inductive position in physics, and extends even further a disinclination towards hypothesis-making and testing. &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; is divided into 5 parts with 19 chapters. The first chapter sets the stage for this work, a functional analysis of verbal behavior. Skinner presents verbal behavior as a function of controlling consequences and stimuli, not as the product of a special inherent capacity. Neither does he ask us to be satisfied with simply describing the structure, or patterns, of behavior. Skinner deals with some alternative, traditional formulations, and moves on to his own functional position.

==General problems==
In the ascertaining of the strength of a response Skinner suggests some criteria for &quot;strength&quot; (probability): emission, energy-level, speed, and repetition. He notes that these are all very limited means for inferring the strength of a response as they do not always vary together and they may come under the control of other factors. Emission is a yes/no measure, however the other three—energy-level, speed, repetition—comprise &quot;possible indications of relative strength&quot;.
* Emission – If a response is emitted it may tend to be interpreted as having some strength. Unusual or difficult conditions would tend to lend evidence to the inference of strength. Under typical conditions it becomes a less compelling basis for inferring strength. This is an inference that is either there or not, and has no gradation of value.
* Energy-level – Unlike emission as a basis for inference, energy-level (response magnitude) provides a basis for inferring the response has a strength with a high range of varying strength. Energy level is a basis from which we can infer a high tendency to respond. An energetic and strong &quot;Water!&quot; forms the basis for inferring the strength of the response as opposed to a weak, brief &quot;Water&quot;.
* Speed – Speed is the speed of the response itself, or the latency from the time in which it could have occurred to the time in which it occurs. A response given quickly when prompted forms the basis for inferring a high strength.
* Repetition – &quot;Water! Water! Water!&quot; may be emitted and used as an indication of relative strength compared to the speedy and/or energetic emission of &quot;Water!&quot;. In this way repetition can be used as a way to infer strength.

==Mands==

Chapter Three of Skinner&#x27;s work &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; discusses a functional relationship called the &quot;mand&quot;. Mand is verbal behavior under functional control of satiation or deprivation (that is, motivating operations) followed by characteristic reinforcement often specified by the response. A &quot;mand&quot; is typically a demand, command, or request. The mand is often said to &quot;describe its own reinforcer&quot; although this is not always the case, especially as Skinner&#x27;s definition of verbal behavior does not require that mands be vocal. A loud knock at the door, may be a mand &quot;open the door&quot; and a servant may be called by a hand clap as much as a child might &quot;ask for milk&quot;.

Lamarre &amp; Holland (1985) study on mands demonstrated the role of motivating operations. The authors contrived motivating operations for objects by training behavior chains that could not be completed without certain objects. The participants learned to mand for these missing objects, which they had previously only been able to tact...

==Behavior under the control of verbal stimuli==

===Textual===
In Chapter Four Skinner notes forms of control by verbal stimuli. One form is textual behavior which refers to the type of behavior we might typically call reading or writing. A vocal response is controlled by a verbal stimulus that is not heard. There are two different modalities involved (&quot;reading&quot;). If they are the same they become &quot;copying text&quot; (see Jack Michael on copying text), if they are heard, then written, it becomes &quot;taking dictation&quot;, and so on.

===Echoic===
Skinner was one of the first to seriously consider the role of imitation in language learning. He introduced this concept into his book &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; with the concept of the echoic. It is a behavior under the functional control of a verbal stimulus. The verbal response and the verbal stimulus share what is called point to point correspondence (a formal similarity.) The speaker repeats what is said. In echoic behavior, the stimulus is auditory and response is vocal. It is often seen in early shaping behavior. For example, in learning a new language, a teacher might say &quot;parsimonious&quot; and then say &quot;can you say it?&quot; to induce an echoic response. Winokur (1978) is one example of research about echoic relations.

==Tacts==

Chapter Five of &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot; discusses the tact in depth. A tact is said to &quot;make contact with&quot; the world, and refers to behavior that is under functional control of a non-verbal stimulus and generalized conditioned reinforcement. The controlling stimulus is nonverbal, &quot;the whole of the physical environment&quot;. In linguistic terms, the tact might be regarded as &quot;expressive labelling&quot;. Tact is the most useful form of verbal behaviour to other listeners, as it extends the listeners contact with the environment. In contrast, the tact is the most useful form of verbal behaviour to the speaker as it allows to contact tangible reinforcement. 
Tacts can undergo many extensions: generic, metaphoric, metonymical, solecistic, nomination, and &quot;guessing&quot;. It can also be involved in abstraction. Lowe, Horne, Harris &amp; Randle (2002) would be one example of recent work in tacts.

==Intraverbal==
&quot;Intraverbals&quot; are verbal behavior under the control of other verbal behavior. Intraverbals are often studied by the use of classic association techniques.

==Audiences==
Audience control is developed through long histories of reinforcement and punishment. Skinner&#x27;s three-term contingency can be used to analyze how this works: the first term, the antecedent, refers to the audience, in whose presence the verbal response (the second term) occurs. The consequences of the response are the third term, and whether or not those consequences strengthen or weaken the response will affect whether that response will occur again in the presence of that audience. Through this process, audience control, or the probability that certain responses will occur in the presence of certain audiences, develops. Skinner notes that while audience control is developed due to histories with certain audiences, we do not have to have a long history with every listener in order to effectively engage in verbal behavior in their presence (p. 176). We can respond to new audiences (new stimuli) as we would to similar audiences with whom we have a history.

===Negative audiences===
An audience that has punished certain kinds of verbal behavior is called a negative audience (p. 178): in the presence of this audience, the punished verbal behavior is less likely to occur. Skinner gives examples of adults punishing certain verbal behavior of children, and a king punishing the verbal behavior of his subjects.

==Summary of verbal operants==
The following table summarizes the new verbal operants in the analysis of verbal behavior.

==Verbal operants as a unit of analysis==
Skinner notes his categories of verbal behavior: &quot;mand, textual, intraverbal, tact, audience relations&quot;, and notes how behavior might be classified. He notes that form alone is not sufficient (he uses the example of &quot;fire!&quot; having multiple possible relationships depending on the circumstances). Classification depends on knowing the circumstances under which the behavior is emitted. Skinner then notes that the &quot;same response&quot; may be emitted under different operant conditions. Skinner states:
That is, classification alone does little to further the analysis—the functional relations controlling the operants outlined must be analyzed consistent with the general approach of a scientific analysis of behavior.

==Multiple causation==
Skinner notes in this chapter how any given response is likely to be the result of multiple variables. Secondly, that any given variable usually affects multiple responses. The issue of multiple audiences is also addressed, as each audience is, as already noted, an occasion for strong and successful responding. Combining audiences produces differing tendencies to respond.

==Supplementary stimulation==
Supplementary stimulation is a discussion to practical matters of controlling verbal behavior given the context of material which has been presented thus far. Issues of multiple control, and involving many of the elementary operants stated in previous chapters are discussed.

==New combinations of fragmentary responses==
A special case of where multiple causation comes into play creating new verbal forms is in what Skinner describes as fragmentary responses. Such combinations are typically vocal, although this may be due to different conditions of self-editing rather than any special property. Such mutations may be &quot;nonsense&quot; and may not further the verbal interchange in which it occurs. Freudian slips may be one special case of fragmentary responses which tend to be given reinforcement and may discourage self-editing. This phenomenon appears to be more common in children, and in adults learning a second language. Fatigue, illness and insobriety may tend to produce fragmentary responding.

==Autoclitics==

An &quot;autoclitic&quot; is a form of verbal behavior which modifies the functions of other forms of verbal behavior. For example, &quot;I think it is raining&quot; possesses the autoclitic &quot;I think&quot; which moderates the strength of the statement &quot;it is raining&quot;. An example of research that involved autoclitics would be Lodhi &amp; Greer (1989).

==Self-strengthening==
Here Skinner draws a parallel to his position on self-control and notes: &quot;A person controls his own behavior, verbal or otherwise, as he controls the behavior of others.&quot; Appropriate verbal behavior may be weak, as in forgetting a name, and in need of strengthening. It may have been inadequately learned, as in a foreign language. Repeating a formula, reciting a poem, and so on. The techniques are manipulating stimuli, changing the level of editing, the mechanical production of verbal behavior, changing motivational and emotional variables, incubation, and so on. Skinner gives an example of the use of some of these techniques provided by an author.

==Logical and scientific==
The special audience in this case is one concerned with &quot;successful action&quot;. Special methods of stimulus control are encouraged that will allow for maximum effectiveness. Skinner notes that &quot;graphs, models, tables&quot; are forms of text that allow for this kind of development. The logical and scientific community also sharpens responses to assure accuracy and avoid distortion. Little progress in the area of science has been made from a verbal behavior perspective; however, suggestions of a research agenda have been laid out.

==Tacting private events==
Private events are events accessible to only the speaker. Public events are events that occur outside of an organism&#x27;s skin that are observed by more than one individual. A headache is an example of a private event and a car accident is an example of a public event.

The tacting of private events by an organism is shaped by the verbal community who differentially reinforce a variety of behaviors and responses to the private events that occur (Catania, 2007, p. 9). For example, if a child verbally states, &quot;a circle&quot; when a circle is in the immediate environment, it may be a tact. If a child verbally states, &quot;I have a toothache&quot;, she/he may be tacting a private event, whereas the stimulus is present to the speaker, but not the rest of the verbal community.

The verbal community shapes the original development and the maintenance or discontinuation of the tacts for private events (Catania, 2007, p. 232). An organism responds similarly to both private stimuli and public stimuli (Skinner, 1957, p. 130). However, it is harder for the verbal community to shape the verbal behavior associated with private events (Catania, 2007, p. 403). It may be more difficult to shape private events, but there are critical things that occur within an organism&#x27;s skin that should not be excluded from our understanding of verbal behavior (Catania, 2007, p. 9).

Several concerns are associated with tacting private events. Skinner (1957) acknowledged two major dilemmas. First, he acknowledges our difficulty with predicting and controlling the stimuli associated with tacting private events (p. 130). Catania (2007) describes this as the unavailability of the stimulus to the members of the verbal community (p. 253). The second problem Skinner (1957) describes is our current inability to understand how the verbal behavior associated with private events is developed (p. 131).

Skinner (1957) continues to describe four potential ways a verbal community can encourage verbal behavior with no access to the stimuli of the speaker. He suggests the most frequent method is via &quot;a common public accompaniment&quot;. An example might be that when a kid falls and starts bleeding, the caregiver tells them statements like, &quot;you got hurt&quot;. Another method is the &quot;collateral response&quot; associated with the private stimulus. An example would be when a kid comes running and is crying and holding their hands over their knee, the caregiver might make a statement like, &quot;you got hurt&quot;. The third way is when the verbal community provides reinforcement contingent on the overt behavior and the organism generalizes that to the private event that is occurring. Skinner refers to this as a &quot;metaphorical or metonymical extension&quot;. The final method that Skinner suggests may help form our verbal behavior is when the behavior is initially at a low level and then turns into a private event (Skinner, 1957, p. 134). This notion can be summarized by understanding that the verbal behavior of private events can be shaped through the verbal community by extending the language of tacts (Catania, 2007, p. 263).

Private events are limited and should not serve as &quot;explanations of behavior&quot; (Skinner, 1957, p. 254). Skinner (1957) continues to caution that, &quot;the language of private events can easily distract us from the public causes of behavior&quot; (see functions of behavior).

==Chomsky&#x27;s review and replies==
In 1959, Noam Chomsky published an influential critique of &quot;Verbal Behavior&quot;. Chomsky pointed out that children acquire their first language without being explicitly or overtly &quot;taught&quot; in a way that would be consistent with behaviorist theory (see Language acquisition and Poverty of the stimulus), and that Skinner&#x27;s theories of &quot;operants&quot; and behavioral reinforcements are not able to account for the fact that people can speak and understand sentences that they have never heard before.

According to Frederick J. Newmeyer:

Chomsky&#x27;s review has come to be regarded as one of the foundational documents of the discipline of cognitive psychology, and even after the passage of twenty-five years it is considered the most important refutation of behaviorism. Of all his writings, it was the Skinner review which contributed most to spreading his reputation beyond the small circle of professional linguists.

Chomsky&#x27;s 1959 review, amongst his other work of the period, is generally thought to have been influential in the decline of behaviorism&#x27;s influence within linguistics, philosophy and cognitive science. One reply to it was Kenneth MacCorquodale&#x27;s 1970 paper &quot;On Chomsky&#x27;s Review of Skinner&#x27;s Verbal Behavior&quot;. MacCorquodale argued that Chomsky did not possess an adequate understanding of either behavioral psychology in general, or the differences between Skinner&#x27;s behaviorism and other varieties. As a consequence, he argued, Chomsky made several serious errors of logic. On account of these problems, MacCorquodale maintains that the review failed to demonstrate what it has often been cited as doing, implying that those most influenced by Chomsky&#x27;s paper probably already substantially agreed with him. Chomsky&#x27;s review has been further argued to misrepresent the work of Skinner and others, including by taking quotes out of context. Chomsky has maintained that the review was directed at the way Skinner&#x27;s variant of behavioral psychology &quot;was being used in Quinean empiricism and naturalization of philosophy&quot;.

== Current research ==

Current research in verbal behavior is published in &quot;The Analysis of Verbal Behavior&quot; (TAVB), and other Behavior Analytic journals such as &quot;The Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior&quot; (JEAB) and the &quot;Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis&quot; (JABA). Also research is presented at poster sessions and conferences, such as at regional Behavior Analysis conventions or Association for Behavior Analysis (ABA) conventions nationally or internationally. There is also a Verbal Behavior Special Interest Group (SIG) of the Association for Behavior Analysis (ABA) which has a mailing list.

&quot;Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention&quot; and the &quot;Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis&quot; both publish clinical articles on interventions based on verbal behavior.

Skinner has argued that his account of verbal behavior might have a strong evolutionary parallel. In Skinner&#x27;s essay, &quot;Selection by Consequences&quot; he argued that operant conditioning was a part of a three-level process involving genetic evolution, cultural evolution and operant conditioning. All three processes, he argued, were examples of parallel processes of selection by consequences. David L. Hull, Rodney E. Langman and Sigrid S. Glenn have developed this parallel in detail. This topic continues to be a focus for behavior analysts. Behavior analysts have been working on developing ideas based on Verbal Behaviour for fifty years, and despite this, experience difficulty explaining generative verbal behavior.

<text>Annie Chancel (born 16 August 1945), known as Sheila, is a French pop singer who became successful as a solo artist in the 1960s and 1970s, and was also part of the duo Sheila &amp; Ringo with her husband singer Ringo. She also fronted a disco act called Sheila and B. Devotion. Her stage name came from the title of her first release, a French cover version of &quot;Sheila&quot;, a hit by Tommy Roe.

Throughout her career, Sheila has sold more than 85 million records worldwide.

==Career==
Sheila started her musical career in 1962, after being noticed by Claude Carrère, a French record producer and songwriter. Her parents signed a contract with Carrère for her, when she was 16; the contract led to an artistic collaboration which lasted for more than 20 years. In 1995, a lawsuit put an end to this life-time deal. She entered into a long royalties battle against her former producer, which she won.

Sheila had numerous hits in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, playing the typical &#x27;girl next door&#x27;. Her first hit was &quot;L&#x27;école est finie&quot; (&quot;School is over&quot;), in 1962 (1 million copies). It reached the #1 position in France. In 1964, she recorded and released &quot;Vous Les Copains, Je Ne Vous Oublierai Jamais&quot;, her French adaptation of the international hit, &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot;
as popularized by Manfred Mann, also charted. Notably, the original pop song was sung by The Exciters from a year earlier in 1963.

In the movie, &quot;Eight Women&quot;, Ludivine Sagnier sang her 1963 hit &quot;Papa t&#x27;es plus dans l&#x27;coup&quot; (&quot;Daddy, you are not in on it anymore&quot;). Sheila&#x27;s music also featured in the 1996 François Ozon film &quot;Une robe d&#x27;été&quot; (&quot;A Summer Dress&quot;). The character Sébastien is a fan of Sheila, and Sheila&#x27;s version of Cher&#x27;s &quot;Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)&quot; was on the soundtrack. &quot;Les rois mages&quot; also featured in &quot;Ma vie en rose&quot;, a 1997 gender-bender film, &quot;Love me baby&quot;, in 1978, &quot;Attention les enfants regardent&quot;, with Alain Delon, &quot;Spacer&quot; in &quot;Podium&quot; (2004).

After more than a decade of targeting the French teen music audience, mainly in French but also in Spanish, German and Italian, Sheila made a change in her career by releasing &quot;Les Femmes (Qu&#x27;y a-t-il dans le cœur des femmes)&quot;, a song by Christine Charbonneau in 1976. &quot;Les Femmes&quot; climbed to number one and stayed in the chart for three months. &quot;Les Femmes&quot; brought to Sheila a revolution of modernity, making her one of the idols of the French pop music.

In 1977, she started singing in English as Sheila and B. Devotion (in some countries records were under the name &quot;Sheila B. Devotion&quot;) and changed her style to disco music. Sheila was accompanied by three male dancers who made up the &quot;Black Devotion&quot; in her routine. She enjoyed international success with hits such as &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Love Me Baby&quot;, &quot;You Light my Fire&quot; and &quot;Spacer&quot; (from the album &quot;King of the World&quot;, produced by Chic). &quot;Spacer&quot; is one of her biggest hits with more than 5 million copies sold worldwide.
According to different interviews, she often said her experience with Chic completely changed her way of working and singing. It was the beginning of a deep artistic disagreement with her French manager Carrère, which made Sheila leave France, move to New York &quot;to start all over again&quot; and studied at the Actors Studio.

After her disco period, in 1981, Sheila (without the &quot;B. Devotion&quot; gimmick) recorded the pop rock album &quot;Little Darlin&quot;&#x27;, produced by Keith Olsen, and was back in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The title song became her only U.S. Billboard Hot 100 hit, reaching #49 in early 1982.

She put an end to her artistic collaboration with her manager Carrère at the beginning of the 1980s, then took a brand new musical direction in 1983 when she met Yves Martin, a composer and producer who later became her husband. She recorded three albums under his direction between 1983 and 1988, and her new songs were critically acclaimed. Becoming disillusioned with the music business and record industry, she abandoned her music career between 1989 and 1998. During this break, she wrote three successful books, had her own regular TV show, played in a TV series and started making sculptures.

However Sheila had a successful comeback in music in 1998 with a new CD compiling re-recordings of some of her hits, along with new songs. It went gold within one month. Thanks to this unexpected success, another studio album called &quot;Dense&quot; was released a year later with brand new songs.

Sheila is still widely popular today, performing concerts in 1998 and 2002 at the Olympia, in 2006 at the Cabaret Sauvage with an unplugged concert or on tour with &quot;La Tournée des Idoles&quot; in 2009 and 2010. In 2005 she signed a deal with Warner Music France after many years of negotiation. All of her recordings, including her self-produced albums, can now be released on CD under the same label. Following this agreement, her complete recordings were issued in an 18 CD box set in 2006. It included more than 400 songs, unknown recordings, demos, alternative takes, duets, TV performances and German, Italian, Spanish and English versions of her hits.

In 2007, Warner Music France decided to release separately each of her albums on CD with its original artwork and bonus tracks. Most of them are also re-issued on vinyl LP format.

Her album &quot;Little Darlin&quot;&#x27; was remastered and released in Japan in January 2011 on SHM-CD. This reissue is the replica of the original LP with its Japanese cover. The pictures and artwork are completely different from other international pressings. It also contains the title &quot;Prisoner&quot; as on the first Japanese release in 1981 (it remained unknown on other markets until 1996).

She was one of the contestants during the Second season of &quot;Danse avec les stars&quot; (Dancing with the Stars).

Sheila celebrated her 50 years in the music industry with a show at the Paris Olympia music hall in September 2012. A brand new album &quot;Solide&quot; with 10 new songs was released in November 2012.
In February 2013 she received a &quot;Victoire de la Musique&quot; award celebrating her 50-year career anniversary.

Late 2019, Sheila took part in the French version of the famous Masked Singer TV franchise, under the Squirrel costume. She was eliminated in the second episode, and unmasked to overall surprise since none of the show&#x27;s panelists guessed her successfully.

==Personal life==
She married French singer Guy Bayle known by the name Ringo or Ringo Willy Cat on 13 February 1973 in Paris at the church Notre-Dame de la Gare. The two also formed a musical duo Sheila &amp; Ringo most famous for their hit &quot;Les Gondoles à Venise&quot;.

In 1975, she gave birth to a son, Ludovic, who died of a tragic overdose in 2017. She described him as &quot;the love of my life&quot;.

<text>Nemetschek Group is a vendor of software for architects, engineers and the construction industry. The company develops and distributes software for planning, designing, building and managing buildings and real estate, as well as for media and entertainment.

== History ==
===20th century===
The company was founded by Prof. Georg Nemetschek in 1963, and initially went by the name of Ingenieurbüro für das Bauwesen (engineering firm for the construction industry), focusing on structural design. It was one of the first companies in the industry to use computers and developed software for engineers, initially for its own requirements. In 1977, Nemetschek started distributing its program &quot;Statik 97/77&quot; for civil engineering.

At the Hanover Fair in 1980, Nemetschek presented a software package for integrated calculation and design of standard components for solid construction. This was the first software enabling computer-aided engineering (CAE) on microcomputers, and the product remained unique on the market for many years.


In 1989, Nemetschek Programmsystem GmbH was founded and was responsible for software distribution; Georg Nemetschek&#x27;s engineering firm continued to be in charge of program development. The main product, Allplan – a CAD system for architects and engineers, was launched in 1984. This allowed designers to model buildings in three dimensions. Nemetschek began to expand internationally in the 1980s. By 1996, the company had subsidiaries in eight European countries and distribution partners in nine European countries; since 1992, it has also had a development site in Bratislava, Slovakia.

The first acquisitions were made at the end of the 1990s, including the structural design program vendor Friedrich + Lochner. The company, operating as Nemetschek AG since 1994, went public in 1999 (it has been listed in the Prime Standard market segment and the TecDAX in Frankfurt ever since).

===21st century===
Two major company takeovers followed in 2000: the American firm Diehl Graphsoft (now Vectorworks) and Maxon Computer GmbH, with its Cinema 4D software for visualization and animation. In 2006, Nemetschek acquired Hungary&#x27;s Graphisoft (for its key product ArchiCAD), and Belgium&#x27;s SCIA International.

In November 2013, Nemetschek acquired the MEP software provider Data Design System (DDS). On 31 October 2014, the acquisition of Bluebeam Software, Inc. was concluded. At the end of 2015, Solibri was acquired.

Since 2016, the company has operated as Nemetschek SE. Later that year, SDS/2 was acquired. In 2017, it acquired dRofus and RISA. MCS Solutions was acquired in 2018, closely followed by the acquisition of Axxerion B.V and Plandatis and subsequently rebranded to Spacewell. Other acquisitions have been completed at a brand level (for example, Redshift Rendering Technologies, Red Giant and Pixologic were acquired by Maxon, DEXMA by Spacewell).

Since 18 September 2018, Nemetschek is listed in the MDAX in addition to its TecDAX listing.

Among others, Nemetschek is a member of the BuildingSMART e.V. and the &quot;Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen&quot; (DGNB) (German Sustainable Building Council), actively advocating for open building information modeling (BIM) standards (&quot;open BIM&quot;) in the AEC/O industry.

== Business units ==
Since 2008, Nemetschek has acted as a holding company with four business units:

* Planning &amp; Design (Architecture and Civil Engineering)
* Build &amp; Construct
* Manage &amp; Operate
* Media &amp; Entertainment.

The holding company maintains 13 product brands, covering the whole building lifecycle, from planning to operations.

<text>Varpa is an outdoor game of physical skill that allegedly dates back to the Viking Age and survived in Gotland. It is similar to boules and horseshoes but is played with a flat and heavy object called a &quot;varpa&quot; instead of balls. Varpas used to be well-shaped stones, but nowadays, aluminium is more popular. A varpa can weigh between . The object of the game is to throw the varpa as close to a stick as possible. The stick is away for women and away for men. The game can be played individually or in teams.

No official nationally sponsored varpa teams exist; however, unofficial leagues are growing in popularity among youth in suburban areas of Sweden and Norway.

&quot;Varpa&quot; is an old word which simply means &quot;to throw&quot;.

Varpa is one of the disciplines at the annual Stånga Games (&quot;Stångaspelen&quot;).

<text>Christopher Smart (11 April 1722 – 20 May 1771) was an English poet. He was a major contributor to two popular magazines, &quot;The Midwife&quot; and &quot;The Student&quot;, and a friend to influential cultural icons like Samuel Johnson and Henry Fielding. Smart, a high church Anglican, was widely known throughout London.

Smart was infamous as the pseudonymous midwife &quot;Mrs. Mary Midnight&quot; and for widespread accounts of his father-in-law, John Newbery, locking him away in a mental asylum for many years over Smart&#x27;s supposed religious &quot;mania&quot;. Even after Smart&#x27;s eventual release, a negative reputation continued to pursue him as he was known for incurring more debt than he could repay; this ultimately led to his confinement in debtors&#x27; prison until his death.

His two most widely known works are &quot;A Song to David&quot; and &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;, which are believed to have been written during his confinement in St. Luke&#x27;s Asylum, although this is still debated by scholars as there is no record of when they were written. It is even more unclear when the works were written, as &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; was not published until 1939 when it was found in a library archive, and &quot;A Song to David&quot; received mixed reviews until the 19th century. To his contemporaries, Smart was known mainly for his many contributions in the journals &quot;The Midwife&quot; and &quot;The Student&quot;, along with his famous &quot;Seaton Prize poems&quot; and his mock epic &quot;The Hilliad&quot;. Although he is recognized primarily as a religious poet, his poetry includes various other themes, such as his theories on nature and his promotion of English nationalism.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Christopher Smart was born in Shipbourne in Kent, England on the Fairlawne estate of William, Viscount Vane, younger son of Lord Barnard of Barnard Castle. He was, according to his nephew, &quot;of a delicate constitution having been born earlier than the natural period&quot;. He was baptized in Wrotham parish on 11 May 1722. His father was Peter Smart, steward or bailiff of Fairlawne. His mother, Winifred (née Griffiths) was from Radnorshire, Wales. Before giving birth to Christopher, Winifred had two daughters, Margaret and Mary Anne.

During his younger years, Fairlawne was the residence of Christopher Vane, 1st Baron Barnard and Lady Barnard, who bequeathed £200 to Smart. He supposedly received this sum due to his father&#x27;s closeness to the Vane family, Smart being named after Christopher Vane, and the young boy being considered &quot;the pride of Fairlawn&quot;. In 1726, three years after Christopher Vane died, Peter Smart purchased Hall-Place in East Barming, which included a mansion house, fields, orchards, gardens, and woodland, a property that was influential throughout Smart&#x27;s later life. From the age of four until eleven, he spent much time around the farms, but did not participate, leading to speculation that he had had asthma attacks. However, not all scholars agree that he was a &quot;sickly youth&quot;. The only written record of events during his childhood comes from his writing of a short poem, at the age of four, in which he challenges a rival to the affections of a twelve-year-old girl.

While at Hall-Place, Smart was sent to the local Maidstone Grammar School where he was taught by Charles Walwyn, a scholar from Eton College who had received an MA from King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1696. It was here that Smart received an intensive education in Latin and Greek. He did not complete his education at Maidstone however, as his father died on 3 February 1733, and his mother took Smart and his siblings to live near relatives in Durham after selling off a large portion of the estate to pay off Peter Smart&#x27;s debts.

Smart then attended Durham School, where the Reverend Mr. Richard Dongworth was headmaster; it is not known whether he lived with his uncle, John Smart, or with a school master. He spent vacations at Raby Castle, which was owned by Henry Vane, 1st Earl of Darlington, the grandson of Christopher Vane. Henry Vane and his wife Grace, sister to William and Henrietta Fitzroy the Duke and Duchess of Cleveland, had four children, Henry, Frederick, Anne, and Mary. They were only a few years younger than Smart and became playmates, with Anne and Henry &quot;pairing off&quot; with Christopher and his sister Margaret respectively. Although nothing resulted from the match, Anne has been traditionally described as being his &quot;first love&quot;. During his time with the Vane family, Smart dedicated many poems to Henrietta, the Duchess of Cleveland. It was his closeness with the Vane family along with his skill for learning that encouraged Henrietta to allow him a pension of 40 pounds yearly, continued by her husband after her death in 1742. This allowed Smart to attend Pembroke College, Cambridge.

===College===

Smart was admitted to Pembroke College on 20 October 1739 as a sizar under Leonard Addison. Although it is unclear why he chose Pembroke College, Addison was named in Peter Smart&#x27;s trust deed (1729). As a sizar, he occasionally had to wait on the &quot;Fellows&#x27; table&quot; and perform other menial tasks. On 12 July 1740, he was awarded the &quot;Dr. Watt&#x27;s Foundation scholarship&quot;, which granted him six pounds a year until he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree. In addition to this income, he was also granted four pounds a year for scholarship. Although he was successful academically, he began to run up debt in order to pay for his extravagant lifestyle while at the college.

During his time at Pembroke, Smart borrowed numerous books spanning the fields of literature, religion, and science. These works helped when he wrote the three &quot;Tripos Verse&quot; at the end of each year. These poems were written in Latin and they, along with his other Latin poems like his translation of Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Ode on St. Cecilia&#x27;s Day&quot;, led to him being awarded the Craven scholarship for classics on 10 June 1742, which paid £25 a year for 14 years. These scholarships, combined with his becoming a fellow in 1743, justified Smart calling himself &quot;Scholar of the University&quot;.

In 1743, Smart published his translation of Pope&#x27;s &quot;Ode on St. Cecilia&#x27;s Day&quot; as &quot;Carmen Cl. Alexandri Pope in S. Caeciliam Latine Redditum&quot; and paid for the publication himself. With this translation, he wanted to win Pope&#x27;s favor and translate Pope&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Man&quot;, but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Criticism&quot; (&quot;De Arte Critica&quot;) instead. The initial letter sent from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart. In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding the letter from Pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke&#x27;s 400th year in 1744.

In October 1745, Smart was elected Praelector of Philosophy, which paid one pound a year, and made one of three Keepers of the Common Chest. The next year, on 11 February 1746, he became a Master of Arts and was later elected on 10 October 1746, to Praelector of Philosophy, Praelector of Rhetoric, and Keeper of the Common Chest. However, he had run up more debt of over twice his annual income, and he was not re-elected in 1747 to the Praelectorship and was denied his control over the Common Chest accounts. However, he was made a &quot;Preacher before the Mayor of Cambridge&quot; at the college under the title &quot;Concionatori Coram Praetore oppidano&quot;, and his modest living during this year allowed him to regain Praelectorship in Philosophy along with being made a catechist, which suggests that he was ordained in the Anglican church.

In 1746, Smart became tutor to John Hussey Delaval, but this was abruptly cancelled because Delaval was removed from Pembroke after a variation of broken rules and mischief. After recovering from this, Smart returned to studying. In April 1747, a comedy he wrote just months before, &quot;A Trip to Cambridge&quot;, or &quot;The Grateful Fair&quot;, was performed in Pembroke College Hall, with many parts, including female roles, played by Smart himself. The prologue was printed in &quot;The Cambridge Journal Weekly Flying-Post&quot;, which claimed that the play received &quot;Universal Applause&quot;.

During his final years at Pembroke, Smart was writing and publishing many poems. On 9 January 1748, there were three proposals for &quot;A Collection of Original Poems, By Christopher Smart, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke Hall, in the University of Cambridge&quot; that would include &quot;The Hop Garden&quot;, &quot;The Judgment of Midas, a Masque&quot;, his odes, his translations into Latin, and some original Latin poems. Thomas Gray, on 17 March 1747, referred to this work as Smart&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Odes&quot;. This collection was not printed in 1748 but was delayed until 1752, and was re-titled &quot;Poems on Several Occasions&quot;.

Between 1740 and 1746, he was introduced to Harriot Pratt, and he began to write poetry about her. By 1749, he was in love with her and wrote to his friend Charles Burney (father of Fanny Burney), &quot;I am situated within a mile of my Harriote &amp; Love has robd Friendship of her just dues ... There was a great musical crash at Cambridge, which was greatly admired, but I was not there, being much better pleased with hearing my Harriote on her spinnet &amp; organ at her ancient mansion&quot;, suggesting that he was living permanently in Market Downham, London. Although he wrote many poems dedicated to Harriot, his poem &quot;The Lass with the Golden Locks&quot; (1752) claims that he was done with both Harriot, Polly, and other women. The &quot;lass with the golden locks&quot; who replaced Smart&#x27;s previous fancies was Anna Maria Carnan. Anna would be Smart&#x27;s future wife and she was the stepdaughter of John Newbery, Smart&#x27;s future publisher.

=== Influence ===
While Smart was prolific in his own right, he was influenced by many of his contemporaries, as well as those that came before him. His primary influences being Alexander Pope, Virgil and Horace. Pope&#x27;s influence can especially be seen in Smart&#x27;s poem &quot;The Hilliad,&quot; a play on Pope&#x27;s poem &quot;The Dunciad.&quot;

Smart also left his mark on writers after him. In his book &quot;Poor Kit Smart,&quot; Christopher Devlin writes of Smart&#x27;s influence &quot;Robert Browning, however, D. G. Rossetti and Sir Francis Palgrave proclaimed aloud that this madman&#x27;s &quot;Song to David&quot; was along the masterpieces of the English language.&quot;

===London===
Although Smart seemed to turn his life around at Pembroke, he slowly abandoned the college for London. During 1749, he listed himself on Pembroke&#x27;s &quot;Liber Absentiae&quot; and would occasionally return to Pembroke throughout 1749 and 1750. Because of his relationship with those at Pembroke, he was allowed to keep his name in the college&#x27;s records, which allowed him to participate and be charged as a member of the college. By 1750 he was living near St. James&#x27;s Park and was busy familiarising himself with Grub Street. It was this year that Smart developed a business relationship with John Newbery. He worked for Newbery and married his stepdaughter in 1752. It is unknown how Smart and Newbery met, but Smart&#x27;s daughter claimed Charles Burney introduced the two. Newbery was looking for a contributory to his &quot;The Midwife&quot; and &quot;The Student&quot; magazines, and it is possible that Smart&#x27;s winning of Cambridge&#x27;s Seatonian Prize on 25 March 1750 brought his poetic abilities to Newbery&#x27;s attention.

The Seatonian Prize was a contest for one English poem each year on the topic of &quot;the Perfections or Attributes of the Supreme Being&quot; and the prize would be the &quot;Rent of the [Kislingbury, Northamptonshire] estate&quot; It was established by the will of Thomas Seaton, an &quot;Anglican divine and hymn writer&quot;. Smart wrote in the &quot;poetical essay&quot; tradition using Miltonic blank verse. In 1750, the poem he won the prize with was &quot;On the Eternity of the Supreme Being&quot;. The prize was only worth 17 pounds each year before 7 pounds were deducted for the publication of the poem. However, after the publication of the poem, Smart became a regular contributor in &quot;The Student&quot;.

&quot;The Student&quot;, before Smart&#x27;s work, was a serious magazine that included a few poems and critical essays. However, once he joined and began writing under many pseudonyms, the magazine became filled with satire, parody, and humorous essays and poems. Along with him composing 15 of the essays and the majority of the poems published in the two volumes of the magazine, he decided to append three of &quot;The Inspector&quot;, a &quot;humorous news report&quot;, to the second of the volumes. These reports included many &quot;puff pieces&quot; promoting Smart&#x27;s works along with various stories written by his friends and associates, including the famous writers/poets Henry Fielding, Samuel Johnson, William Collins, and Tobias Smollett. However, this was not the only important publication produced by him during this time.

During his time in London, Smart&#x27;s work included &quot;Mother Midnight&#x27;s Oratory&quot;, a series of &quot;wild tavern entertainments&quot; to which Smart acted as writer and performer.

===&quot;The Midwife&quot;===

&quot;The Midwife&quot;, first published on 16 October 1751 and lasting until April 1753, was produced primarily by Smart while he worked on &quot;The Student&quot;. This magazine was popular enough to be published in four editions. To hide his identity for practical and humorous reasons, he adopted the persona of a midwife, also known as a &quot;Mrs. Midwife&quot; in slang, and called this persona &quot;Mrs. Mary Midnight&quot;.

When his poem &quot;Night Piece&quot; was attacked by William Kenrick in &quot;Kapelion, or Poetical Ordinary&quot;, possibly out of a prearranged publicity stunt, Smart used &quot;The Midwife&quot; in December 1750, to attack back at Kenrick and promised an &quot;Old Woman&#x27;s Dunciad&quot; to be written against the other poet. However, Kenrick beat Smart to the use of the title and printed his own in January 1751. This feud lasted as attacks published in a few issues of &quot;The Midwife&quot;, but it soon died out when Smart focused his attention to writing a prologue and epilogue for a production of &quot;Othello&quot; and using the magazine to promote it.

His attention slowly shifted away from &quot;The Midwife&quot; when he wrote for, and won, the &quot;Seatonian Prize&quot; for his &quot;On the Immensity of the Supreme Being&quot; and when he began working with Newbery&#x27;s children&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Lilliputian Magazine&quot;. However, Smart returned to this character full force when he established &quot;The Old Woman&#x27;s Oratory; or Henley in Petticoats&quot; in December 1751. The &quot;Oratory&quot; included Smart playing as Mrs. Midnight, various songs and dances, animal acts, and &quot;miscellany&quot; acts. The &quot;Oratory&quot; was successful, and was completely redone on 21 January 1752. However, not everyone enjoyed the show, and Horace Walpole described the performance as &quot;the lowest buffoonery in the world even to me who am used to my uncle Horace.&quot; Late in 1752, Smart finished and published a collection of his works as &quot;Poems on Several Occasions&quot;, which resulted in the end of the &quot;Oratory&quot; and &quot;The Midwife&quot;.

===Later career===

In 1752, Christopher Smart was slowly dragged into a large &quot;paper war&quot; that involved many of London&#x27;s writers. After the publication of &quot;Poems on Several Occasions&quot;, including &quot;The Hop-Garden&quot;, in June 1752, John Hill launched a major attack upon Smart&#x27;s poetry. Smart responded with his mock-epic &quot;The Hilliad&quot;. Before the release of Smart&#x27;s poem, Hill was engaged in a large literary battle between various members of Grub Street&#x27;s and London&#x27;s writing community, especially Henry Fielding. This battle may have been for publicity only and lasted over many months before Smart involved himself. However, even with such a late entry, his &quot;Hilliad&quot; was the &quot;loudest broadside&quot; of the war.

Smart was incurring numerous debts, and started publishing as much as possible during this time to support his family. He is said to have married Anna-Maria Carnan around 1752 or 1753, although the exact date is unknown; they initially kept their marriage a secret so Smart could continue to get money from his Cambridge fellowship, which ended shortly thereafter. By 1754, the pair already had two daughters, Marianne (3 May 1753) and Elizabeth Anne (27 October 1754). As a married man, he could no longer remain enrolled at Pembroke and collect his scholarship money when his marriage and children were made apparent to the heads of the college. Newbery allowed Smart, along with his wife and their children, to live at Canonbury House, Islington. Although Newbery had a strong reputation for charity, he was determined to have complete control over his writers. It is likely that such an attitude combined with monetary problems led to a rift forming between the two by 1753.

Between 1753 and 1755, Smart published or republished at least 79 works. However, even if he received money from each of these publications, they were unable to provide enough of an income to support a family, especially to his standard of living. While he was producing a poem each year for the &quot;Seatonian Prize&quot;, this amounted to very little of his writing; he was forced into a life of &quot;hack work&quot;, which was described by his contemporary, Arthur Murphy, as &quot;a bookseller is his only friend, but for that bookseller, however liberal, he must toil and drudge.&quot; In December 1755, he finished &quot;The Works of Horace, Translated Literally into English Prose&quot;, a translation of Horace, which was widely used but brought him little profit.

He signed a 99-year contract in November 1755 to produce a weekly paper entitled &quot;The Universal Visitor or Monthly Memorialist&quot; for Thomas Gardner and Edmund Allen. However, the strain of publishing caused Smart to have a seizure, and he was unable to keep up with the publishing of the paper. Allen was a friend of Samuel Johnson, and it was Samuel Johnson, along with many other friends of Smart, who contributed to the magazine in order to help Smart keep up with his contract. In March 1756, Newbery published, without Smart&#x27;s authority, his final &quot;Seatonian Prize&quot; poem, &quot;On the Goodness of the Supreme Being&quot;, and later, on 5 June, he published, again without Smart&#x27;s authority, his &quot;Hymn to the Supreme Being&quot;, a poem which thanked God for recovery from an illness of some kind, possibly a &quot;disturbed mental state&quot;. The &quot;Hymn to the Supreme Being&quot; marks the time in Smart&#x27;s life after the mysterious &quot;fit&quot; was resolved and the beginning of his obsession with religion and his praying &quot;without ceasing&quot;.

===Asylum confinement===

A &quot;Commission of Lunacy&quot; was taken out against Smart, and he was admitted to St Luke&#x27;s Hospital for Lunatics on 6 May 1757 as a &quot;Curable Patient&quot;. It is possible that Smart was confined by Newbery over old debts and a poor relationship between the two; Newbery had previously mocked Smart and his immorality in his &quot;A Collection of Pretty Poems for the Amusement of Children six Foot High.&quot; Regardless of the exact reasons, there is evidence suggesting that Newbery&#x27;s admittance of Smart into the mental asylum was not based on &quot;madness&quot;. However, there is also evidence that an incident of some kind took place in St. James&#x27;s Park in which Smart started to pray loudly in public until he had &quot;routed all the company&quot; (&quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; B89).

It is not known what exactly happened during his confinement, but Smart did work on two of his most famous poems, &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; and &quot;A Song to David&quot;. What is known is that he may have been in a private madhouse before St Luke&#x27;s and that he was later moved from St Luke&#x27;s to Mr. Potter&#x27;s asylum until his release. At St Luke&#x27;s, he transitioned from being &quot;curable&quot; to &quot;incurable&quot;, and was moved to Mr. Potter&#x27;s asylum for monetary reasons. During this time, Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland. His isolation led him into writing religious poetry, although he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;. Although it is debated as to whether his turning inward to examine himself in his poetry represents an evangelical type of Christianity, his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for &quot;unmediated revelation&quot;. There is an &quot;inner light&quot; that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during this time, and that inner light connects him to the Christian God.

Smart was left alone, except for his cat Jeoffry and the occasional gawker. It is very possible that he felt &quot;homeless&quot; during this time and surely felt that he was in a &quot;limbo … between public and private space&quot;. In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart&#x27;s &quot;madness&quot; as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning remarked that &quot;A Song to David&quot; was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats.

He was discharged from St. Luke&#x27;s asylum uncured after one year. He was thought to be confined elsewhere for the following seven years, during which time he wrote &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;. Elizabeth, his daughter, claimed: &quot;He grew better, and some misjudging friends who misconstrued Mr Newbery&#x27;s great kindness in placing him under necessary &amp; salutary restriction which might possibly have eventually wrought a cure, invited him to dinner and he returned to his confinement no more.&quot; Although this may be a misstatement of the events, Smart did leave the asylum on 30 January 1763.

===Final years===
&quot;A Song to David&quot; was printed on 6 April 1763 along with a proposal for a new translation of the &quot;Psalms&quot;. It is said that Smart composed the poem during his second period of confinement to an asylum during an episode of religious mania The poem was received harshly, which was possibly just thinly veiled personal attacks over Smart being freed from the asylum just weeks before. However, Kenrick, Smart&#x27;s former rival, praised the poem in one of his own printed on 25 May 1763. Also, John Lockman followed on 21 June 1763, with his own poem in praise of Smart&#x27;s and Samuel Boyce followed this on 15 July 1763 with another. Along with this support, Smart responded to his critics at the &quot;Critical Review&quot;; in regards to Smart&#x27;s response, the &quot;Critical Review&quot; claimed that they would &quot;say no more of Mr. Smart&quot;.

After &quot;A Song to David&quot;, he tried to publish a collection of his &quot;Psalms&quot; translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations. Newbery then hired Smart&#x27;s new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced Smart to find a new publisher, delaying the printing of his &quot;Psalms&quot;. Finally, on 12 August 1765, he printed &quot;A Translation of the Psalms of David&quot;, which included &quot;Hymns and Spiritual Songs&quot; and a second edition of &quot;A Song to David&quot;. This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery&#x27;s edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart&#x27;s. However, modern criticism has received Smart&#x27;s version in a more favourable light. While working on this project, he was also working on a translation of the &quot;Phaedrus&quot; and a verse translation of &quot;Horace&quot;. His verse &quot;Horace&quot; was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.

On 20 April 1770, Smart was arrested for debt. On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, the gentleman who originally introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the King&#x27;s Bench Prison. Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the &quot;Rules&quot; (allowing him some freedom), and Smart&#x27;s final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: &quot;Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, I beg you to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, in two or three days.&quot; On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, &quot;Hymns, for the Amusement of Children&quot;.

===Death===
In response to his uncle&#x27;s death, Christopher Hunter wrote, &quot;I trust he is now at peace; it was not his portion here.&quot; Fanny Burney, in her journal, wrote:

On 22 May 1771, a jury of twelve fellow inmates of the King&#x27;s Bench Prison declared that Smart &quot;upon the Twentieth day of May Instant died a Natural Death within the Rules of the Prison.&quot; He was buried on 26 May in St Paul&#x27;s Covent Garden.

==Literary themes and styles==
Christopher Smart received occasional mentions by critics and scholars after his death, especially by Robert Browning, but analysis and commentary on his works increased dramatically with the &quot;discovery&quot; of &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; in 1939. Many recent critics approach Smart from a religious perspective (Neil Curry, Harriet Guest, Clement Hawes, Chris Mounsey). However, some also favour a psychology/sexual analysis of his works (Lance Bertelsen, Clemet Hawes, Alan Liu).

===Religion===
Although Smart wrote the &quot;Seatonian Prize&quot; poems early on, there is a contrast between the mimicked Miltonic blank verse and the intense exploration of religion found in his later works. His first &quot;Seatonian Prize&quot; poem, &quot;On the Eternity of the Supreme Being&quot; is part of two traditional types of religious writing: &quot;authoritative discourse of religious poetry&quot; and &quot;tentative and self-critical discourse of an apparently more personal devotion&quot; In connecting the two, he redefines &quot;the role of the religious poet.&quot; By establishing a debate between these two forms, Harriet Guest claims that Smart creates &quot;a poetic space which allows the poet to make provisional, even questionable statements&quot;, which are important to his later works. To Guest, Smart, in his religious poems, &quot;is not concerned to offer instruction in Christian conduct.&quot; Besides the greater theological debate, the poems are also the origins of Smart&#x27;s belief that all of creation is constantly praising God, and that a poet must &quot;give voice to mute nature&#x27;s praise of God.&quot;

&quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; reflects an abandonment of traditional poetic structures in order to explore complex religious thought. His &quot;Let&quot; verses join creation together as he seemingly writes his own version of Biblical poetry. Smart, in &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;, plays on words and the meaning behind words in order to participate with the divine that exists within language. Although the original manuscript divided the &quot;Let&quot; and &quot;For&quot; verses onto opposing sides of the manuscript, Karina Williams claims that &quot;Dr W. H. Bond then discovered that some of the LET and FOR folios were numbered and dated concurrently, and that these chronologically parallel texts were further connected by verbal links.&quot; This justified her combining the two sides to follow each other. Using this as a model, Guest claims that the &quot;For&quot; verses explore religion with a &quot;personal tone&quot; and the &quot;Let&quot; are &quot;unambiguous&quot; and deal with public matters. Jeanne Walker goes further than Guest and claims that the &quot;Let &quot; and &quot;For&quot; sections are united with the Hebrew tradition and &quot;iterate both present and future simultaneously, that is, they redeem time.&quot;

Words and language connect the poet to divine revelation, and God is the &quot;great poet&quot; who used language in order to create the universe. Through words and language, Smart attempted to capture the creative power of those words. By relying on the power of words, Smart is, according to Clement Hawes, subverting &quot;Anglican control over religious functions and services.&quot; In essence, Smart&#x27;s approach to religion in &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; is comparable to John Wesley&#x27;s theological dictum and to the writings of John Perro and William Bowling. He also creates his own natural philosophy and criticizes science, like that established by Isaac Newton, for their ignoring &quot;the glory of Almighty God.&quot;

To Smart, each piece of matter is alive because it is connected to God, and matter cannot be described in a cold manner that disconnects it from this reality. However, Smart accomplished his new science by relying on Newtonian empiricism. As part of his desire to bring back the divine language to poetry and science, he creates an &quot;Ark of Salvation&quot; in order to describe a prophetic and apocalyptic future which emphasises the importance of Christ and England. Along with being prophetic, the poem itself is modelled after the canticles and follows the form of the Benedicite. The Benedicite is not the only model however, and there is a strong link between &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; and the psalm tradition.

Smart&#x27;s &quot;A Song to David&quot; is an attempt to bridge poetry written by humans and Biblical poetry. The Biblical David plays an important role in this poem just as he played an important role in &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; However, David in &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; is an image of the creative power of poetry whereas he becomes a fully realized model of the religious poet. By focusing on David, Smart is able to tap into the &quot;heavenly language.&quot; Many critics have focused on the role of David as planner of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and his possible role with the Freemasons. However, the true life of the poem comes later when Christ is introduced as the major subject. After Christ is introduced, Smart attempts to &quot;reach to heaven&quot; and the final passages, to Neil Curry, represent a &quot;final rush for glory.&quot;

According to Mounsey, &quot;A Song to David&quot; and Smart&#x27;s &quot;Psalms&quot; is an attempt to &quot;Christianize&quot; the Old Testament through writing an 18th-century psalter. However, the &quot;Psalms&quot; perform a secondary function: they allow Smart to relate to the suffering of David and to reinforce his own religious convictions by following his Biblical model. As part of Smart&#x27;s &quot;Christianizing&quot; of the &quot;Psalms&quot;, Jesus becomes a divine form of suffering, and Smart becomes further juxtaposed with his Biblical model as both praise God for Jesus&#x27;s ultimate sacrifice and for the beauty of all creation. The &quot;Hymns&quot; and &quot;Psalms&quot; form their own sort of liturgy and attempt to reform Anglican liturgy by emphasizing God&#x27;s place in nature.

Smart&#x27;s &quot;Hymns&quot; are modelled after a tradition exemplified by Robert Nelson. They are steeped in Anglican tradition and also emphasize English patriotism and England&#x27;s divine favour. The &quot;Hymns&quot;, according to Guest, &quot;[express] a delight in creation that is largely absent from the work of other hymn-writers of the century, unless they are paraphrasing the words of David.&quot; To Hawes, the &quot;Hymns&quot; exemplify an evangelical spirit that separates Smart from the traditional Anglican church. Although he wrote his second set of hymns, &quot;Hymns for the Amusement of Children&quot;, for a younger audience, Smart cares more about emphasizing the need for children to be moral instead of &quot;innocent&quot;. These works have been seen as possibly too complicated for &quot;amusement&quot; because they employ ambiguities and complicated theological concepts. In essence, the &quot;Hymns for the Amusement of Children&quot; is intended to teach children the specific virtues that make up the subject matter of the work. Like the &quot;Hymns for the Amusement of Children&quot;, Smart&#x27;s &quot;The Parables of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ&quot; were designed to teach morals. However, these &quot;Parables&quot; alter the original Biblical parables in order to simplify them and help them &quot;make sense&quot; As such, Todd Parker claims that the &quot;Parables&quot;, and the other religious works of Smart, are part of his final push for the &quot;evangelization of London&#x27;s reading public.&quot;

===Language===
The language and commentary on language is of particular emphasis in &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;. To Alan Jacobs, Smart&#x27;s use of language represents his attempt to connect to the &quot;Ur language&quot;, allowing Smart to connect to &quot;the Word calling forth the world.&quot; This is similar to David and Orpheus&#x27;s ability as poets to create through their song. In his constant emphasis on the force of poetry, &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; takes on the qualities of the &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; tradition. As such, Smart is attempting to develop a poetic language that will connect him to the &quot;one true, eternal poem.&quot; The poetic language that he creates is related to Adam&#x27;s &quot;onomathetic&quot; tradition, or the idea that names hold significant weight in the universe and that Adam was able to join in with creation by naming objects.

In &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;, he describes his writing as creating &quot;impressions&quot;. To accomplish this task, he incorporated puns and onomatopoeia in order to emphasize the theological significance of his poetic language. In addition to these techniques, he relied on repeated language and allusions to traditional works and to scripture for a source of authority in various works, especially in his &quot;Hymns&quot;. Along with scriptural authority, he relies on prophetic rhetoric to gain his audience&#x27;s sympathy.

During the 18th century, there was a debate over poetic language and the translations of Smart, especially of Horace, positioned him as one who sought to redeem traditional forms and understanding of language. However, some critics, like Alan Liu, believe that translations are effectively forced to compete against the original works, and that Smart&#x27;s language, at least in his translations, must constantly seek to undermine the original authors, like Horace. Not all critics agree with Liu, and those like Donald Davie believe that the Smart&#x27;s translations cannot be compared to the original works, but are part of a system of Smart competing against the language of his contemporaries. Thomas Keymer further verified this point about Smart&#x27;s translations by revealing that the poet claims, in William Toldervy&#x27;s &quot;The History of Two Orphans&quot;, &quot;But what heaven-exciting harmony might we not expect from that exalted genius, who can produce such lines as these following!&quot; in anticipation of replacing the previous flawed translations of the &quot;Psalms&quot;.

Regardless of where he stood on the specific issue of translation Smart believed that there was an importance to language, which carried over to his constant revising of his poems to slowly correct them. Many of Smart&#x27;s poems served a dual purpose, and when put to music were altered to meet various standards. By constantly revising, he ensured that his poems were always the &quot;authentic&quot; version.

===Gender===
Smart&#x27;s role as Mrs. Midnight along with his gendered comments in &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; form the focal point for analysing his understanding of sexuality and gender. With Mrs. Midnight, Smart challenges the traditional social order found in 18th-century England. However, some, like Lance Bertelsen, argue that the Mrs. Midnight persona reveals a split personality torn between masculine and feminine roles. Fraser Easton say the existence of Mrs. Midnight proves that Smart identified a female connection to poetry and her character was used to defy popular 18th-century notions of who is able to attain knowledge. This role allowed Smart to focus on &quot;social and sexual dimensions&quot; in his satire. However, there is a potentially darker side to Mrs. Midnight, and she could represent his feelings that he was &quot;emasculated by economic pressures.&quot;

The image of &quot;horns&quot; in &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; is commonly viewed as a sexual image. Easton puts particular emphasis on the image of horns as a phallic image and contends that there are masculine and feminine horns throughout Smart&#x27;s poem. Hawes picks up this theme and goes on to claims that the poem shows &quot;that [Smart] had been &#x27;feminized&#x27; as a cuckold.&quot; In response to this possible cuckolding, &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; predicts a misogynistic future while simultaneously undermining this effort with his constant associations to female creation.

===Environmental===
Smart had a reputation for being a &quot;dedicated gardener&quot;. His poem &quot;The Hop-Garden&quot; helped to further this reputation, and even during his stay in a mental asylum he convinced others of his bond with nature. Johnson witnessed Smart&#x27;s time in asylum and stated, &quot;he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden.&quot; Gardening, to Smart, was a way in which humans could interact with nature and actually &quot;improve&quot; on the natural landscape.

However, Smart did not only write about gardens and vegetation, and his focus on his cat Jeoffry is widely known and his focus on nature connects him to those mistreated and neglected by 18th-century society. The first fragment of &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; is a poetic &quot;Ark&quot; that pairs humans with animals in order to purify all of creation. The whole work relies on his extensive background in botany and his knowledge of taxonomy. He actively participated in the 18th-century taxonomy systems established by Carl Linnaeus; however, Smart is mythologising his view of nature and creation when he adds information from Pliny the Elder into his work.

By using this knowledge, Smart was able to give a &quot;voice&quot; to nature; he believed that nature, like his cat Jeoffry, is always praising God but needs a poet in order to bring out that voice. As such, themes of animals and language are merged in &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;, and Jeoffry is transformed into a manifestation of the &quot;Ars Poetica&quot; tradition.

===Freemasonry===
Many critics have focused on the role of David as planner of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and his possible role with the Freemasons. Although it is not known for sure whether Smart was a Freemason or not, there is evidence suggesting that he was either part of the organization or had a strong knowledge of its belief system. Based on personal admittance to contributing to &quot;A Defence of Freemasonry&quot;, contemporary verification of his participation in the volume and with Masonic meetings, there is enough to confirm &quot;his participation in Masonic affairs.&quot; Furthermore, there are accounts of Smart attending meetings at the Bell Tavern in Westminster. The information available has led Marie Roberts to declare in her 1986 book &quot;British Poets and Secret Societies&quot;, &quot;It has been universally accepted by scholars that Christopher Smart ... was a Freemason yet no record of his membership has been traced.&quot; However, in the notes to Chris Mounsey&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;Christopher Smart: Clown of God&quot;, Marie Roberts&#x27; 1986 book is referred to as &quot;an account of Smart&#x27;s work which accepts his association with the Freemasons,&quot; but in Mounsey&#x27;s view, &quot;Since neither Smart&#x27;s name nor his pseudonyms appear in the records of the Freemasons, it is highly unlikely he was ever one of their number.&quot;

Smart&#x27;s involvement with Masonry can be traced through his poems, including &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot; and &quot;A Song to David&quot;, with his constant references to Masonic ideas and his praise of Freemasonry in general. In &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;, Smart declares &quot;I am the Lord&#x27;s builder and free and accepted MASON in CHRIST JESUS&quot; (B 109). This declaration of being a &quot;free and accepted MASON&quot; has been interpreted to define his connection to speculative Masonry. The &quot;in Christ Jesus&quot; declaration places Smart within a Christian version of Masonry. He also declares himself to be &quot;the Lord&#x27;s builder&quot; and this connects his life with the building of King Solomon&#x27;s Temple, an important Masonic idea. In &quot;A Song to David&quot;, Smart returns to the building of Solomon&#x27;s Temple and incorporates many of the Masonic images that he uses in &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;.

It was this detail that encouraged many critics to try to decode the &quot;seven pillar&quot; section of &quot;A Song of David&quot; along the lines of Masonic imagery. The poem follows two traditional sets of motions common to Freemason writing that mimic the image of Jacob&#x27;s Ladder: movement from earth to heaven and movement from heaven to earth. This image further connects Freemason belief surrounding the relationship of David to Solomon&#x27;s Temple. While these images, and further images in &quot;A Song to David&quot; are related also to depictions of the Temple in Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended&quot; (1728), the John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Temple Spiritualiz&#x27;d&quot; (1688), and to the Geneva Bible, these works were relied on by the Freemasons.

Based on this theory, the first pillar, the Greek alpha, represents the mason&#x27;s compass and &quot;God as the Architect of the Universe.&quot; The second, the Greek gamma, represents the mason&#x27;s square. In addition, the square represents the &quot;vault of heaven.&quot; The third, the Greek eta, represents Jacob&#x27;s ladder itself and is connected to the complete idea of seven pillars. The fourth, the Greek theta, is either &quot;the all-seeing eye or the point within a circle.&quot; The fifth letter, the Greek iota, represents a pillar and the temple. The sixth letter, the Greek sigma, is an incomplete hexagram, otherwise known as &quot;the blazing star or hexalpha&quot; to the Freemasons. The last, the Greek omega, represents a lyre and David as a poet.

One of his most famous poems, &quot;Jubilate Agno&quot;, was not published until 1939, by William Force Stead. In 1943, lines from this poem were set to music by Benjamin Britten with the translated title &quot;Rejoice in the Lamb&quot;.

He is also credited with the writing of &quot;A Defence of Freemasonry&quot; (1765), also known as &quot;A Defence of Freemasonry as practised in the regular lodges, both foreign and domestic, under the Constitution of the English Grand Master, in which is contained a refutation of Mr. Dermott&#x27;s absurd and ridiculous account of Freemasonry, in his book entitled &#x27;Ahiman Rezon&#x27; and the several queries therein reflecting on the regular Masons, briefly considered and answered&quot;, that response to Laurence Dermott&#x27;s &quot;Ahiman Rezon&quot;. Although there is no direct attribution on the text&#x27;s title page, it was established as his work since its publication, and it includes a poem directly attributed to him.

A two-volume edition of the &quot; Complete Poems of Christopher Smart &quot; was published in 1949 by Norman Callan, Professor of English at Queen Mary College, London (now University). There have been numerous reprints. Penguin published &quot;Selected Poems&quot; in 1990.

<text>Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an inherited heart disease.

ACM is caused by genetic defects of parts of the cardiac muscle known as desmosomes, areas on the surface of muscle cells which link them together. The desmosomes are composed of several proteins, and many of those proteins can have harmful mutations.

ARVC can also develop in intense endurance athletes in the absence of desmosomal abnormalities. Exercise-induced ARVC is possibly a result of excessive right ventricular wall stress during high intensity exercise.

The disease is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy that primarily involves the right ventricle, though cases of exclusive left ventricular disease have been reported. It is characterized by hypokinetic areas involving the free wall of the ventricle, with fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, with associated arrhythmias often originating in the right ventricle. The nomenclature ARVD is currently thought to be inappropriate and misleading as ACM does not involve dysplasia of the ventricular wall. Cases of ACM originating from the left ventricle led to the abandonment of the name ARVC.

ACM can be found in association with diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair, in an autosomal recessive condition called Naxos disease, because this genetic abnormality can also affect the integrity of the superficial layers of the skin most exposed to pressure stress.

ACM is an important cause of ventricular arrhythmias in children and young adults. It is seen predominantly in males, and 30–50% of cases have a familial distribution.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Those affected by arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy may not have any symptoms at all despite having significant abnormalities in the structure of their hearts. If symptoms do occur, the initial presentation is often due to abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) which in arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy may take the form of palpitations, or blackouts. Sudden death may be the first presentation of ACM without any preceding symptoms. These symptoms often occur during adolescence and early adulthood, but signs of ACM may rarely be seen in infants.

As ACM progresses, the muscle tissue within the ventricles may dilate and weaken. The right ventricle typically weakens first, leading to fatigue and ankle swelling. In the later stages of the disease in which both ventricles are involved shortness of breath may develop, especially when lying flat.

== Causes ==

=== Genetics ===
ACM is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with variable expression. Only 30% to 50% of individuals affected by ACM will test positive to one of the known genetic mutations in chromosomal loci associated with the disease. Novel studies showed that mutations (point mutations) in genes encoding for desmosomal proteins (see intercalated disc) are the main causatives for the development of this disease. Recently it has been shown, that mutations in the desmin DES gene could cause ACM. Desmin is an intermediate filament protein, which is linked to the desmosomes. Different &quot;DES&quot; mutations cause an abnormal aggregation of desmin and associated proteins. The penetrance is 20–35% in general, but significantly higher in Italy. Seven gene loci have been implicated in ACM. It is unclear whether the pathogenesis varies with the different loci involved. Standard genetic screening test are currently tested and evaluated in different state of the art cardiovascular research centres and hospitals. Types include:

=== Exercise-induced ARVC ===
In recent years, several studies have found that excessive long-term sports activity can cause exercise-induced arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (EIARVC). For some athletes ARVC might develop due to high-endurance exercise and it most often develops without an underlying desmosomal abnormalities. This could possibly be a result of excessive right ventricular (RV) wall stress during very high volumes of training, which is known to be causing a disproportionate remodeling of RV.

In a 2003 study, 46 endurance athletes, mostly cyclists, presented with various symptoms suggestive of arrhythmia of RV origin. 59% of participants tested met the criteria for ARVC, and another 30% for possible ARVC. Only 1 athlete of the group had a family history of hereditary ARVC.

Exercise-induced ARVC and athlete&#x27;s heart have overlapping features.

== Pathogenesis ==
The pathogenesis of ACM is largely unknown. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) appears to play a large role. It was previously thought that only the right ventricle is involved, but recent cohorts have shown many cases of left ventricular disease and biventricular disease. The disease process starts in the subepicardial region and works its way towards the endocardial surface, leading to transmural involvement (possibly accounting for the aneurysmal dilatation of the ventricles). Residual myocardium is confined to the subendocardial region and the trabeculae of the ventricles. These trabeculae may become hypertrophied.

Aneurysmal dilatation is seen in 50% of cases at autopsy. It usually occurs in the diaphragmatic, apical, and infundibular regions (known as the triangle of dysplasia). The left ventricle is involved in 50–67% of individuals. If the left ventricle is involved, it is usually late in the course of disease, and confers a poor prognosis.

There are two pathological patterns seen in ACM, Fatty infiltration and fibro-fatty infiltration.

=== Fatty infiltration ===
At first, fatty infiltration, is confined to the right ventricle. This involves a partial or near-complete substitution of myocardium with fatty tissue &quot;without&quot; wall thinning. It involves predominantly the apical and infundibular regions of the RV. The left ventricle and ventricular septum are usually spared. No inflammatory infiltrates are seen in fatty infiltration. There is evidence of myocyte (myocardial cell) degeneration and death seen in 50% of cases of fatty infiltration.

=== Fibro-fatty infiltration ===
The second, fibro-fatty infiltration, involves replacement of myocytes with fibrofatty tissue. A patchy myocarditis is involved in up to 2/3 of cases, with inflammatory infiltrates (mostly T cells) seen on microscopy. Myocardial atrophy is due to injury and apoptosis. This leads to thinning of the RV free wall (to &lt; 3 mm thickness) Myocytes are replaced with fibrofatty tissue. The regions preferentially involved include the RV inflow tract, the RV outflow tract, and the RV apex. However, the LV free wall may be involved in some cases. Involvement of the ventricular septum is rare. The areas involved are prone to aneurysm formation.

=== The Role of Exercise ===
Recently, some studies have identified strenuous exercise as a novel risk for accelerated progression of the disease. One retrospective study on 301 patients conclusively demonstrated that the subpopulations participating in strenuous physical activity (professional athletes for example) had an earlier onset of symptoms and earlier mortality compared to other populations.

== Ventricular arrhythmias ==
Ventricular arrhythmias due to ACM typically arise from the diseased right ventricle. The type of arrhythmia ranges from frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) to ventricular tachycardia (VT) to ventricular fibrillation (VF).

While the initiating factor of the ventricular arrhythmias is unclear, it may be due to triggered activity or reentry.

Ventricular arrhythmias are usually exercise-related, suggesting that they are sensitive to catecholamines. The ventricular beats typically have a right axis deviation. Multiple morphologies of ventricular tachycardia may be present in the same individual, suggesting multiple arrhythmogenic foci or pathways.

Right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) tachycardia is the most common VT seen in individuals with ACM. In this case, the EKG shows a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology with an inferior axis.

== Diagnosis ==
The differential diagnosis for the ventricular tachycardia due to ACM include:
* Congenital heart disease
** Repaired tetralogy of Fallot
** Ebstein&#x27;s anomaly
** Uhl&#x27;s anomaly
** Atrial septal defect
** Partial anomalous venous return
* Acquired heart disease
** Tricuspid valve disease
** Pulmonary hypertension
** Right ventricular infarction
** Bundle-branch re-entrant tachycardia
* Miscellaneous
** Pre-excited AV re-entry tachycardia
** Idiopathic RVOT tachycardia
** Sarcoidosis

In order to make the diagnosis of ACM, a number of clinical tests are employed, including the electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiography, right ventricular angiography, cardiac MRI, and genetic testing.

=== Electrocardiogram ===
90% of individuals with ARVD have some EKG abnormality. The most common EKG abnormality seen in ACM is T wave inversion in leads V1 to V3. However, this is a non-specific finding, and may be considered a normal variant in right bundle branch block (RBBB), women, and children under 12 years old.

RBBB itself is seen frequently in individuals with ACM. This may be due to delayed activation of the right ventricle, rather than any intrinsic abnormality in the right bundle branch.

The epsilon wave is found in about 50% of those with ACM. This is described as a terminal notch in the QRS complex. It is due to slowed intraventricular conduction. The epsilon wave may be seen on a surface EKG; however, it is more commonly seen on signal averaged EKGs.

Ventricular ectopy seen on a surface EKG in the setting of ACM is typically of left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology, with a QRS axis of −90 to +110 degrees. The origin of the ectopic beats is usually from one of the three regions of fatty degeneration (the &quot;triangle of dysplasia&quot;): the RV outflow tract, the RV inflow tract, and the RV apex.

Signal averaged ECG (SAECG) is used to detect late potentials and epsilon waves in individuals with ACM.

=== Echocardiography ===
Echocardiography may reveal an enlarged, hypokinetic right ventricle with a paper-thin RV free wall. The dilatation of the RV will cause dilatation of the tricuspid valve annulus, with subsequent tricuspid regurgitation. Paradoxical septal motion may also be present.

=== Magnetic resonance imaging ===
Fatty infiltration of the RV free wall can be visible on cardiac MRI. Fat has increased intensity in T1-weighted images. However, it may be difficult to differentiate intramyocardial fat and the epicardial fat that is commonly seen adjacent to the normal heart. Also, the sub-tricuspid region may be difficult to distinguish from the atrioventricular sulcus, which is rich in fat.

Cardiac MRI can visualize the extreme thinning and akinesis of the RV free wall. However, the normal RV free wall may be about 3 mm thick, making the test less sensitive.

=== Angiography ===
Right ventricular angiography is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of ACM. Findings consistent with ACM are an akinetic or dyskinetic bulging localized to the infundibular, apical, and subtricuspid regions of the RV. The specificity is 90%; however, the test is observer dependent.

=== Biopsy ===
Transvenous biopsy of the right ventricle can be highly specific for ACM, but it has low sensitivity. False positives include other conditions with fatty infiltration of the ventricle, such as long-term excessive alcohol use and Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy.

False negatives are common, however, because the disease progresses typically from the epicardium to the endocardium (with the biopsy sample coming from the endocardium), and the segmental nature of the disease. Also, due to the paper-thin right ventricular free wall that is common in this disease process, most biopsy samples are taken from the ventricular septum, which is commonly &quot;not&quot; involved in the disease process.

A biopsy sample that is consistent with ACM would have &gt; 3% fat, &gt;40% fibrous tissue, and &lt;45% myocytes.

A post mortem histological demonstration of full thickness substitution of the RV myocardium by fatty or fibro-fatty tissue is consistent with ACM.

=== Genetic testing ===
ACM is an autosomal dominant trait with reduced penetrance. Approximately 40–50% of ACM patients have a mutation identified in one of several genes encoding components of the desmosome, which can help confirm a diagnosis of ACM. Since ACM is an autosomal dominant trait, children of an ACM patient have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease-causing mutation. Whenever a mutation is identified by genetic testing, family-specific genetic testing can be used to differentiate between relatives who are at-risk for the disease and those who are not. ACM genetic testing is clinically available.

=== Diagnostic criteria ===
There is no pathognomonic feature of ACM. The diagnosis of ACM is based on a combination of major and minor criteria. To make a diagnosis of ACM requires either 2 major criteria &quot;or&quot; 1 major and 2 minor criteria &quot;or&quot; 4 minor criteria.

Major criteria
* Right ventricular dysfunction
** Severe dilatation and reduction of RV ejection fraction with little or no LV impairment
** Localized RV aneurysms
** Severe segmental dilatation of the RV
* Tissue characterization
** Fibrofatty replacement of myocardium on endomyocardial biopsy
* Electrocardiographical abnormalities
** Epsilon waves in V1 – V3
** Localized prolongation (&gt;110 ms) of QRS in V1 – V3
** Inverted T waves in V1 -V3 in an individual over 12 years old, in the absence of a right bundle branch block (RBBB)
** Ventricular tachycardia with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology, with superior axis
* Family history
** Familial disease confirmed either clinically or on autopsy or surgery

Minor criteria
* Right ventricular dysfunction
** Mild global RV dilatation and/or reduced ejection fraction with normal LV.
** Mild segmental dilatation of the RV
** Regional RV hypokinesis
* Tissue characterization
* Electrocardiographical abnormalities
** Late potentials on signal averaged EKG.
** Ventricular tachycardia with a left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology, with inferior or unknown axis
** Frequent PVCs (&gt; 500 PVCs / 24 hours)

== Management ==
The goal of management of ACM is to decrease the incidence of sudden cardiac death. This raises a clinical dilemma: How to prophylactically treat the asymptomatic patient who was diagnosed during family screening.

A certain subgroup of individuals with ACM are considered at high risk for sudden cardiac death. Associated characteristics include:
* Young age
* Competitive sports activity
* Malignant familial history
* Extensive RV disease with decreased right ventricular ejection fraction.
* Left ventricular involvement
* Syncope
* Episode of ventricular arrhythmia

Management options include pharmacological, surgical, catheter ablation, and placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

Prior to the decision of the treatment option, programmed electrical stimulation in the electrophysiology laboratory may be performed for additional prognostic information. Goals of programmed stimulation include:
* Assessment of the disease&#x27;s arrhythmogenic potential
* Evaluate the hemodynamic consequences of sustained VT
* Determine whether the VT can be interrupted via antitachycardia pacing (ATP).

Regardless of the management option chosen, the individual is typically advised to undergo lifestyle modification, including avoidance of strenuous exercise, cardiac stimulants (i.e.: caffeine, nicotine, pseudoephedrine) and alcohol.

Regarding physical activity and exercise, ARVC patients, as well as gene carriers of pathogenic ARVC-associated desmosomal mutations, should not participate in competitive sports. These patients should be advised to limit their exercise programmes to leisure-time activities and remain under clinical surveillance.

=== Medication ===
Pharmacologic management of ACM involves arrhythmia suppression and prevention of thrombus formation.

Sotalol, a beta blocker and a class III antiarrhythmic agent, is the most effective antiarrhythmic agent in ACM. Other antiarrhythmic agents used include amiodarone and conventional beta blockers (i.e.: metoprolol). If antiarrhythmic agents are used, their efficacy should be guided by series ambulatory Holter monitoring, to show a reduction in arrhythmic events.

While angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE Inhibitors) are well known for slowing progression in other cardiomyopathies, they have not been proven to be helpful in ACM.

Individuals with decreased RV ejection fraction with dyskinetic portions of the right ventricle may benefit from long term anticoagulation with warfarin to prevent thrombus formation and subsequent pulmonary embolism.

=== Catheter ablation ===
Catheter ablation may be used to treat intractable ventricular tachycardia.
It has a 60–90% success rate. Unfortunately, due to the progressive nature of the disease, recurrence is common (60% recurrence rate), with the creation of new arrhythmogenic foci. Indications for catheter ablation include drug-refractory VT and frequent recurrence of VT after ICD placement, causing frequent discharges of the ICD.

=== Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ===
An ICD is the most effective prevention against sudden cardiac death. Due to the prohibitive cost of ICDs, they are not routinely placed in all individuals with ACM.

Indications for ICD placement in the setting of ACM include:
* Cardiac arrest due to VT or VF
* Symptomatic VT that is not inducible during programmed stimulation
* Failed programmed stimulation-guided drug therapy
* Severe RV involvement with poor tolerance of VT
* Sudden death of immediate family member

Since ICDs are typically placed via a transvenous approach into the right ventricle, there are complications associated with ICD placement and follow-up.

Due to the extreme thinning of the RV free wall, it is possible to perforate the RV during implantation, potentially causing pericardial tamponade. Because of this, every attempt is made at placing the defibrillator lead on the ventricular septum.

After a successful implantation, the progressive nature of the disease may lead to fibro-fatty replacement of the myocardium at the site of lead placement. This may lead to undersensing of the individual&#x27;s electrical activity (potentially causing inability to sense VT or VF), and inability to pace the ventricle.

=== Heart transplant ===
Heart transplant may be performed in ACM. It may be indicated if the arrhythmias associated with the disease are uncontrollable or if there is severe bi-ventricular heart failure that is not manageable with pharmacological therapy.

=== Family screening ===
All first degree family members of the affected individual should be screened for ACM. This is used to establish the pattern of inheritance. Screening should begin during the teenage years unless otherwise indicated. Screening tests include:
* Echocardiogram
* EKG
* Signal averaged EKG
* Holter monitoring
* Cardiac MRI
* Exercise stress test

== Prognosis ==
There is a long asymptomatic lead-time in individuals with ACM. While this is a genetically transmitted disease, individuals in their teens may not have any characteristics of ACM on screening tests.

Many individuals have symptoms associated with ventricular tachycardia, such as palpitations, light-headedness, or syncope. Others may have symptoms and signs related to right ventricular failure, such as lower extremity edema, or liver congestion with elevated hepatic enzymes.

ACM is a progressive disease. Over time, the right ventricle becomes more involved, leading to right ventricular failure. The right ventricle will fail before there is left ventricular dysfunction. However, by the time the individual has signs of overt right ventricular failure, there will be histological involvement of the left ventricle. Eventually, the left ventricle will also become involved, leading to bi-ventricular failure. Signs and symptoms of left ventricular failure may become evident, including congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and an increased incidence of thromboembolic events.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of ACM is about 1/10,000 in the general population in the United States, although some studies have suggested that it may be as common as 1/1,000. Recently, 1/200 were found to be carriers of mutations that predispose to ACM. Based on these findings and other evidence, it is thought that in most patients, additional factors such as other genes, athletic lifestyle, exposure to certain viruses, etc. may be required for a patient to eventually develop signs and symptoms of ACM. It accounts for up to 17% of all sudden cardiac deaths in the young. In Italy, the prevalence is 40/10,000, making it the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young population.

=== Notable cases ===
* Columbus Crew midfielder Kirk Urso collapsed out with friends on August 5, 2012, and was pronounced dead an hour later. An autopsy later revealed the disease to be the likely culprit.
* Sevilla FC and Spanish international left wing-back Antonio Puerta died from the condition, at the age of 22, on 28 August 2007, three days after suffering several cardiac arrests, while disputing a La Liga game against Getafe CF.
* Englishman Matt Gadsby also died from the condition after collapsing on the pitch on 9 September 2006, while playing for Hinckley United in a Conference North game against Harrogate Town.
* Suzanne Crough, an American child actress best known for her role on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, died suddenly from the condition in 2015 at age 52.
* James Taylor English international cricketer, retired April 2016.
* Krissy Taylor, an American model, died at the age of 17 on July 2, 1995, in the family home in Florida. Her official cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia and severe asthma, the latter of which she had never been diagnosed with. Her family had independent experts examine tissue samples of her heart muscle and they concluded that the most likely cause of death was a missed diagnosis of ACM.
* Jordan Boyd (1997–2013), Canadian junior hockey player. He was posthumously diagnosed with the ailment after passing away from a collapse from training camp in 2013.

<text>Archie Franklin Williams (May 1, 1915 – June 24, 1993) was an American U.S. Air Force officer, athlete, and teacher. He was the winner of the 400 meter run at the 1936 Summer Olympics.

==Biography==

Archie Williams was born in Oakland, California, to a family that was active in promoting Black civil rights. He attended University High School in Oakland, then San Mateo Junior College (now College of San Mateo). His coach, Dr. Oliver Byrd, was instrumental in preparing him for future achievements. Soon Williams transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, to become a mechanical engineer and he continued to run track.
w gold medalist Jesse Owens, Williams replied, &quot;Hitler wouldn&#x27;t shake my hand either.&quot; In 2016, the 1936 Olympic journey of the eighteen Black American athletes, including Williams, was documented in the film &quot;Olympic Pride, American Prejudice&quot;.

After graduating from UC Berkeley with a degree in mechanical engineering, Williams was in the first Civilian Pilot Training class in 1939 at Oakland, California. After earning his private pilot&#x27;s license, he earned his instructor rating and was later a civilian instructor at Tuskegee. Entering the service in late 1942, he was one of only 14 African-Americans who were commissioned during World War II in the aviation meteorological cadet program; he graduated from the UCLA program on 6 September 1943. By September 1944, he was in the first Service Pilot training class at Tuskegee and, after graduation, instructed flight cadets in instrument flying as well as teaching meteorology. After the war, he earned qualification as a line pilot and then attended the Air Force Institute of Technology in 1948–1950 earning a B.S. in engineering sciences; he and fellow Tuskegee meteorologist Milton Hopkins were the 3rd and 4th black AF officers to attend this prestigious program. Williams remained a weather officer and rated pilot his entire career, earning his command pilot rating and commanding several weather detachments before retirement from the air force in 1964.

A serious leg injury at a meet in Sweden in 1936 ended his running career, but he became a commercial pilot. During World War II, which Williams once whimsically referred to as his &quot;return to the Olympics—in the Pacific,&quot; Williams was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and retired from the military 22 years later as a lieutenant colonel. A flight instructor while in the air force, Williams remained in education following his military retirement and taught mathematics and computers in California high schools. Archie Williams was a teacher for 21 years until his retirement at age 72 in Sir Francis Drake High School in San Anselmo. He was noted for his love for teaching and helping students, including future author Konrad Dryden. Sir Francis Drake High School was renamed Archie Williams High School in 2021, after the George Floyd protests spurred a worldwide reexamination of place names and monuments connected to racism.

Williams was a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He died in Fairfax, California aged 78.

&quot;Quotation&quot;:
&quot;When I came home, somebody asked me, &#x27;How did those dirty Nazis treat you?&#x27; I replied that I didn&#x27;t see any dirty Nazis, just a lot of nice German people. And I didn&#x27;t have to ride in the back of the bus over there.&quot;

<text>Mary Gladys Webb (25 March 1881 – 8 October 1927) was an English romance novelist and poet of the early 20th century, whose work is set chiefly in the Shropshire countryside and among Shropshire characters and people whom she knew. Her novels have been successfully dramatized, most notably the film &quot;Gone to Earth&quot; in 1950 by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger based on the novel of the same title. The novels are thought to have inspired the famous parody &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; (1932) by Stella Gibbons.

==Life==
She was born Mary Gladys Meredith in 1881 at Leighton Lodge in the Shropshire village of Leighton, where she was baptised at St Mary&#x27;s parish church, 8 miles (13 km) southeast of Shrewsbury. Her father, George Edward Meredith, a private schoolteacher, inspired his daughter with his own love of literature and the local countryside. Her mother, Sarah Alice, was descended from a family related to Scottish author and poet Sir Walter Scott. Mary explored the countryside around her childhood home and developed a sense of detailed observation and description, of both people and places, which later infused her poetry and prose.

At the age of one year, she moved with her parents to Much Wenlock, where they lived at a house called The Grange outside the town. Mary was taught by her father, then sent to a finishing school for girls at Southport in 1895. Webb became a vegetarian as a child and loathed the slaughter of animals. Her parents moved the family again in Shropshire, north to Stanton upon Hine Heath in 1896, before settling in 1902 at Meole Brace, now on the outskirts of Shrewsbury. It was at Stanton she began writing poems and articles for the local parish magazine.

At the age of 20, she developed symptoms of Graves&#x27; disease, a thyroid disorder that resulted in bulging protuberant eyes and throat goitre. It caused ill health throughout her life and probably contributed to her early death. This affliction resulted in her being empathic with the suffering. She is considered to have created a fictional counterpart in the disfiguring harelip of Prue Sarn, the heroine of &quot;Precious Bane&quot;.

Webb&#x27;s first published writing was a five-verse poem, written on hearing news of the Shrewsbury rail accident in October 1907. Her brother, Kenneth Meredith, so liked the poem and thought it potentially comforting for those affected by the disaster that, without her knowledge, he took it to the newspaper offices of the &quot;Shrewsbury Chronicle&quot;, which printed the poem anonymously. Mary, who usually burnt her early poems, was appalled before learning that the newspaper had received appreciative letters from its readers.

On 12 June 1912, Webb married Henry Bertram Law Webb (1885-1939), a teacher, at Meole Brace&#x27;s Holy Trinity parish church. At first, he supported her literary interests. They lived for a time in Weston-super-Mare, before moving back to Mary&#x27;s beloved Shropshire, where they worked as market gardeners until Henry secured a job as a teacher, first at Chester, then at the Priory Grammar School for Boys in Shrewsbury.
The couple lived briefly in Rose Cottage in Hinton Lane and then at The Nills in the village of Pontesbury between the years 1914 and 1916, during which time she wrote &quot;The Golden Arrow&quot;. Her time in the village is celebrated by the eponymously named Mary Webb School and Science College.

The publication of &quot;The Golden Arrow&quot; in 1917 enabled them to move to Lyth Hill, Bayston Hill, a place she loved, where they bought a plot of land and built Spring Cottage.

In 1921, they bought a second property at Hampstead Grove in London, in the hope that by being in the city, she could achieve greater literary recognition. This, however, did not happen, although she won the Prix Femina Vie Heureuse for &quot;Precious Bane&quot; in 1926. By 1927, she was suffering increasingly bad health, her marriage was failing, and she returned to Spring Cottage alone. She died at St Leonards-on-Sea, aged 46. She was buried in Shrewsbury, at the General Cemetery in Longden Road.

==Legacy==
Her writing in general was reviewed as notable for poetic descriptions of nature. Another aspect throughout her work was a close and fatalistic view on human psychology.

After her death, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin brought about her commercial success when, at a dinner of the Royal Literary Fund in 1928, he referred to her as a neglected genius. Consequently, her collected works were republished in a standard edition by Jonathan Cape, becoming best sellers in the 1930s and running into many editions.

Stella Gibbons&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; was a parody of Webb&#x27;s work, as well as of other &quot;loam and lovechild&quot; writers like Sheila Kaye-Smith and Mary E. Mann and, further back, Thomas Hardy. In a 1966 &quot;Punch&quot; article, Gibbons observed:

The large agonised faces in Mary Webb&#x27;s book annoyed me ... I did not believe people were any more despairing in Herefordshire &quot;[sic]&quot; than in Camden Town. 
 Literary critic John Sutherland refers to the genre as the &quot;soil and gloom romance&quot; and credits Webb as its pioneer.

The museum at the Tourist Information Centre in Much Wenlock includes much information on Mary Webb, including a display of photographs of the filming of her novel &quot;Gone to Earth&quot; in 1950.

Her cottage on Lyth Hill (not open to the public) can still be seen. In September 2013, plans were submitted for its demolition.

Three of Webb&#x27;s novels have been reprinted by Virago Press.

<text>In mathematics, Stone&#x27;s representation theorem for Boolean algebras states that every Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a certain field of sets. The theorem is fundamental to the deeper understanding of Boolean algebra that emerged in the first half of the 20th century. The theorem was first proved by Marshall H. Stone. Stone was led to it by his study of the spectral theory of operators on a Hilbert space.

==Stone spaces==

Each Boolean algebra &quot;B&quot; has an associated topological space, denoted here &quot;S&quot;(&quot;B&quot;), called its Stone space. The points in &quot;S&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) are the ultrafilters on &quot;B&quot;, or equivalently the homomorphisms from &quot;B&quot; to the two-element Boolean algebra. The topology on &quot;S&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) is generated by a basis consisting of all sets of the form
formula_1
where &quot;b&quot; is an element of &quot;B&quot;. These sets are also closed and so are clopen (both closed and open). This is the topology of pointwise convergence of nets of homomorphisms into the two-element Boolean algebra.

For every Boolean algebra &quot;B&quot;, &quot;S&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) is a compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space; such spaces are called Stone spaces (also &quot;profinite spaces&quot;). Conversely, given any topological space &quot;X&quot;, the collection of subsets of &quot;X&quot; that are clopen is a Boolean algebra.

==Representation theorem==

A simple version of Stone&#x27;s representation theorem states that every Boolean algebra &quot;B&quot; is isomorphic to the algebra of clopen subsets of its Stone space &quot;S&quot;(&quot;B&quot;). The isomorphism sends an element formula_2 to the set of all ultrafilters that contain &quot;b&quot;. This is a clopen set because of the choice of topology on &quot;S&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) and because &quot;B&quot; is a Boolean algebra.

Restating the theorem using the language of category theory; the theorem states that there is a duality between the category of Boolean algebras and the category of Stone spaces. This duality means that in addition to the correspondence between Boolean algebras and their Stone spaces, each homomorphism from a Boolean algebra &quot;A&quot; to a Boolean algebra &quot;B&quot; corresponds in a natural way to a continuous function from &quot;S&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) to &quot;S&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). In other words, there is a contravariant functor that gives an equivalence between the categories. This was an early example of a nontrivial duality of categories.

The theorem is a special case of Stone duality, a more general framework for dualities between topological spaces and partially ordered sets.

The proof requires either the axiom of choice or a weakened form of it. Specifically, the theorem is equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem, a weakened choice principle that states that every Boolean algebra has a prime ideal.

An extension of the classical Stone duality to the category of Boolean spaces (that is, zero-dimensional locally compact Hausdorff spaces) and continuous maps (respectively, perfect maps) was obtained by G. D. Dimov (respectively, by H. P. Doctor).

<doc id="604117" wikidata="Q159409" url="?curid=604117" title="Louise Bourgeois">
<text>Louise Joséphine Bourgeois (; 25 December 191131 May 2010) was a French-American artist. Although she is best known for her large-scale sculpture and installation art, Bourgeois was also a prolific painter and printmaker. She explored a variety of themes over the course of her long career including domesticity and the family, sexuality and the body, as well as death and the unconscious. These themes connect to events from her childhood which she considered to be a therapeutic process. Although Bourgeois exhibited with the abstract expressionists and her work has a lot in common with Surrealism and feminist art, she was not formally affiliated with a particular artistic movement.

==Life==
=== Early life === 
Bourgeois was born on 25 December 1911 in Paris, France. She was the middle child of three born to parents Joséphine Fauriaux and Louis Bourgeois. Her parents owned a gallery that dealt primarily in antique tapestries. A few years after her birth, her family moved out of Paris and set up a workshop for tapestry restoration below their apartment in Choisy-le-Roi, for which Bourgeois filled in the designs where they had become worn.

In 1930, Bourgeois entered the Sorbonne to study mathematics and geometry, subjects that she valued for their stability, saying &quot;I got peace of mind, only through the study of rules nobody could change.&quot;

Her mother died in 1932, while Bourgeois was studying mathematics. Her mother&#x27;s death inspired her to abandon mathematics and to begin studying art. She continued to study art by joining classes where translators were needed for English-speaking students, especially because translators were not charged tuition. In one such class, Fernand Léger saw her work and told her she was a sculptor, not a painter. Bourgeois took a job as a docent, leading tours at the Musée du Louvre.

Bourgeois graduated from the Sorbonne in 1935. She began studying art in Paris, first at the École des Beaux-Arts and École du Louvre, and after 1932 in the independent academies of Montparnasse and Montmartre such as Académie Colarossi, Académie Ranson, Académie Julian, Académie de la Grande Chaumière and with André Lhote, Fernand Léger, Paul Colin and Cassandre. Bourgeois had a desire for first-hand experience and frequently visited studios in Paris, learning techniques from the artists and assisting with exhibitions. From 1934 to 1938, she is said to have apprenticed herself to some of the so-called &quot;masters&quot; of the time, including Fernand Léger, Paul Colin, and André Lhote. Later, however, Bourgeois became disillusioned with the conception of patriarchal genius which dominated the art world, a change motivated in part by these masters&#x27; refusal to recognize women artists.

In 1938, she opened her own gallery in a space next door to her father&#x27;s tapestry gallery where she showed the work of artists such as Eugène Delacroix, Henri Matisse and Suzanne Valadon, and where she met visiting American art professor Robert Goldwater as a customer. They married and moved to the United States (where he taught at New York University). They had three sons; one was adopted. The marriage lasted until Goldwater&#x27;s death in 1973.

Bourgeois settled in New York City with her husband in 1938. She continued her education at the Art Students League of New York, studying painting under Vaclav Vytlacil, and also producing sculptures and prints. &quot;The first painting had a grid: the grid is a very peaceful thing because nothing can go wrong ... everything is complete. There is no room for anxiety ... everything has a place, everything is welcome.&quot;

Bourgeois incorporated those autobiographical references to her sculpture &quot;Quarantania I&quot;, on display in the Cullen Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.

===Middle years===
For Bourgeois, the early 1940s represented the difficulties of a transition to a new country and the struggle to enter the exhibition world of New York City. Her work during this time was constructed from junkyard scraps and driftwood which she used to carve upright wood sculptures. The impurities of the wood were then camouflaged with paint, after which nails were employed to invent holes and scratches in the endeavor to portray some emotion. The &quot;Sleeping Figure&quot; is one such example which depicts a war figure that is unable to face the real world due to vulnerability. Throughout her life, Bourgeois&#x27;s work was created from revisiting her own troubled past as she found inspiration and temporary catharsis from her childhood years and the abuse she suffered from her father. Slowly she developed more artistic confidence, although her middle years are more opaque, which might be due to the fact that she received very little attention from the art world despite having her first solo show in 1945. Bourgeois father died in 1951 and she then became an American citizen.

In 1945, Bourgeois was featured in an exhibition of fourteen women artists at Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s Art of This Century, titled &quot;The Women&quot;. While this exhibition stimulated debate about the place of women artists in the art world, it also defined them as separate from their canonized male counterparts and reinforced the damaging notion of a universally feminine experience. Commenting on her reception as a woman artist in the 1940s, Bourgeois said that she doesn&#x27;t &quot;know what art made by a woman is...There is no feminine experience in art, at least not in my case, because not just by being a woman does one have a different experience.&quot;

In 1954, Bourgeois joined the American Abstract Artists Group, with several contemporaries, among them Barnett Newman and Ad Reinhardt. At this time she also befriended the artists Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, and Jackson Pollock. As part of the American Abstract Artists Group, Bourgeois made the transition from wood and upright structures to marble, plaster, and bronze as she investigated concerns like fear, vulnerability, and loss of control. This transition was a turning point. She referred to her art as a series or sequence closely related to days and circumstances, describing her early work as the fear of falling which later transformed into the art of falling and the final evolution as the art of hanging in there. Her conflicts in real life empowered her to authenticate her experiences and struggles through a unique art form. In 1958, Bourgeois and her husband moved into a terraced house at West 20th Street, in Chelsea, Manhattan, where she lived and worked for the rest of her life.

Despite the fact that she rejected the idea that her art was feminist, Bourgeois&#x27;s subject was the feminine. Works such as Femme Maison (1946–1947), Torso self-portrait (1963–1964), and Arch of Hysteria (1993), all depict the feminine body. In the late 1960s, her imagery became more explicitly sexual as she explored the relationship between men and women and the emotional impact of her troubled childhood. Sexually explicit sculptures such as Janus Fleuri (1968) show she was not afraid to use the female form in new ways. She stated, &quot;My work deals with problems that are pre-gender&quot;, she wrote. &quot;For example, jealousy is not male or female.&quot; Despite this assertion, in 1976 &quot;Femme Maison&quot; was featured on the cover of Lucy Lippard&#x27;s book &quot;From the Center: Feminist Essays on Women&#x27;s Art&quot; and became an icon of the feminist art movement. With the rise of feminism, her work found a wider audience.

=== Later life ===

In 1973, Bourgeois started teaching at the Pratt Institute, Cooper Union, Brooklyn College and the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture. From 1974 until 1977, Bourgeois worked at the School of Visual Arts in New York where she taught printmaking and sculpture. She also taught for many years in the public schools in Great Neck, Long Island.

In the early 1970s, Bourgeois held gatherings called &quot;Sunday, bloody Sundays&quot; at her home in Chelsea. These salons would be filled with young artists and students whose work would be critiqued by Bourgeois. Bourgeois&#x27;s ruthlessness in critique and her dry sense of humor led to the naming of these meetings. Bourgeois inspired many young students to make art that was feminist in nature. However, Bourgeois&#x27; long-time friend and assistant, Jerry Gorovoy, has stated that Bourgeois considered her own work &quot;pre-gender&quot;.

Bourgeois aligned herself with activists and became a member of the Fight Censorship Group, a feminist anti-censorship collective founded by fellow artist Anita Steckel. In the 1970s, the group defended the use of sexual imagery in artwork. Steckel argued, &quot;If the erect penis is not wholesome enough to go into museums, it should not be considered wholesome enough to go into women.&quot;

In 1978 Bourgeois was commissioned by the General Services Administration to create &quot;Facets of the Sun&quot;, her first public sculpture. The work was installed outside of a federal building in Manchester, New Hampshire. Bourgeois received her first retrospective in 1982, by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Until then, she had been a peripheral figure in art whose work was more admired than acclaimed. In an interview with &quot;Artforum&quot;, timed to coincide with the opening of her retrospective, she revealed that the imagery in her sculptures was wholly autobiographical. She shared with the world that she obsessively relived through her art the trauma of discovering, as a child, that her English governess was also her father&#x27;s mistress.

Between the years of 1984 and 1986, Bourgeois created a series of sculptures all under the title &quot;Nature Study&quot; which continued her lifetime commitment of challenging patriarchal standards and traditional methods of femininity in art.

In the later stages of her career, Bourgeois continued her exploration of the use of less traditional materials, such as stuffed fabric, for her sculptures, thus challenging the accepted elevation of hard-wearing materials such as bronze or stone.

In 1989, Bourgeois made a drypoint etching, &quot;Mud Lane&quot;, of the home she maintained in Stapleton, Staten Island, which she treated as a sculptural environment rather than a living space.

Bourgeois had another retrospective in 1989 at Documenta 9 in Kassel, Germany. In 1993, when the Royal Academy of Arts staged its comprehensive survey of American art in the 20th century, the organizers did not consider Bourgeois&#x27;s work of significant importance to include in the survey. However, this survey was criticized for many omissions, with one critic writing that &quot;whole sections of the best American art have been wiped out&quot; and pointing out that very few women were included. In 2000 her works were selected to be shown at the opening of the Tate Modern in London. In 2001, she showed at the Hermitage Museum.

In 2010, the last year of her life, Bourgeois used her art to speak up for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equality. She created the piece &quot;I Do&quot;, depicting two flowers growing from one stem, to benefit the nonprofit organization Freedom to Marry. Bourgeois has said &quot;Everyone should have the right to marry. To make a commitment to love someone forever is a beautiful thing.&quot; Bourgeois had a history of activism on behalf of LGBT equality, having created artwork for the AIDS activist organization ACT UP in 1993.

=== Death ===

Bourgeois died of heart failure on 31 May 2010, at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. Wendy Williams, the managing director of the Louise Bourgeois Studio, announced her death. She had continued to create artwork until her death, her last pieces being finished the week before.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said that her work &quot;shared a set of repeated themes, centered on the human body and its need for nurture and protection in a frightening world&quot;.

Her husband, Robert Goldwater, died in 1973. She was survived by two sons, Alain Bourgeois and Jean-Louis Bourgeois. Her first son, Michel, died in 1990.

==Work==

===&quot;Femme Maison&quot;===

&quot;Femme Maison&quot; (1946–47) is a series of paintings in which Bourgeois explores the relationship of a woman and the home. In the works, women&#x27;s heads have been replaced with houses, isolating their bodies from the outside world and keeping their minds domestic. This theme goes along with the dehumanization of modern art.

===&quot;Destruction of the Father&quot;===
&quot;Destruction of the Father&quot; (1974) is a biographical and a psychological exploration of the power dominance of father and his offspring. The piece is a flesh-toned installation in a soft and womb-like room. Made of plaster, latex, wood, fabric, and red light, &quot;Destruction of the Father&quot; was the first piece in which she used soft materials on a large scale. Upon entering the installation, the viewer stands in the aftermath of a crime. Set in a stylized dining room (with the dual impact of a bedroom), the abstract blob-like children of an overbearing father have rebelled, murdered, and eaten him.

=== Exorcism in art ===

In 1982, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City featured the unknown artist Louise Bourgeois&#x27; work. She was 70 years old and a mixed media artist who worked on paper and with metal, marble and animal skeletal bones. Childhood family traumas &quot;bred an exorcism in art&quot;, and she desperately attempted to purge her unrest through her work. She felt she could get in touch with issues of female identity, the body, and the fractured family long before the art world and society considered them as subjects to be expressed in art. This was Bourgeois&#x27; way to find her center and stabilize her emotional unrest. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said at the time that &quot;her work is charged with tenderness and violence, acceptance and defiance, ambivalence and conviction&quot;.

===&quot;Cells&quot;===
While in her eighties, Bourgeois produced two series of enclosed installation works she referred to as &quot;Cells&quot;. Many are small enclosures into which the viewer is prompted to peer inward at arrangements of symbolic objects; others are small rooms into which the viewer is invited to enter. In the cell pieces, Bourgeois uses earlier sculptural forms, found objects as well as personal items that carried strong personal emotional charge for the artist.

The cells enclose psychological and intellectual states, primarily feelings of fear and pain. Bourgeois stated that the &quot;Cells&quot; represent &quot;different types of pain; physical, emotional and psychological, mental and intellectual ... Each Cell deals with a fear. Fear is pain ... Each Cell deals with the pleasure of the voyeur, the thrill of looking and being looked at.&quot;

===&quot;Maman&quot;===

In the late 1990s, Bourgeois began using the spider as a central image in her art. &quot;Maman&quot;, which stands more than nine metres high, is a steel and marble sculpture from which an edition of six bronzes were subsequently cast. It first made an appearance as part of Bourgeois&#x27;s commission for The Unilever Series for Tate Modern&#x27;s Turbine Hall in 2000, and recently, the sculpture was installed at the Qatar National Convention Centre in Doha, Qatar. Her largest spider sculpture titled &quot;Maman&quot; stands at over and has been installed in numerous locations around the world.
It is the largest Spider sculpture ever made by Bourgeois.
Moreover, &quot;Maman&quot; alludes to the strength of her mother, with metaphors of spinning, weaving, nurture and protection. The prevalence of the spider motif in her work has given rise to her nickname as &quot;Spiderwoman&quot;.

=== &quot;Maisons fragiles / Empty Houses&quot; ===
Bourgeois&#x27;s &quot;Maisons fragiles / Empty Houses&quot; sculptures are parallel, high metallic structures supporting a simple tray. One must see them in person to feel their impact. They are not threatening or protecting, but bring out the depths of anxiety within you. Bachelard&#x27;s findings from psychologists&#x27; tests show that an anxious child will draw a tall narrow house with no base. Bourgeois had a rocky/traumatic childhood and this could support the reason behind why these pieces were constructed.

===Printmaking===
Bourgeois&#x27;s printmaking flourished during the early and late phases of her career: in the 1930s and 1940s, when she first came to New York from Paris, and then again starting in the 1980s, when her work began to receive wide recognition. Early on, she made prints at home on a small press, or at the renowned workshop Atelier 17. That period was followed by a long hiatus, as Bourgeois turned her attention fully to sculpture. It was not until she was in her seventies that she began to make prints again, encouraged first by print publishers. She set up her old press, and added a second, while also working closely with printers who came to her house to collaborate. A very active phase of printmaking followed, lasting until the artist&#x27;s death. Over the course of her life, Bourgeois created approximately 1,500 printed compositions.

In 1990, Bourgeois decided to donate the complete archive of her printed work to the Museum of Modern Art. In 2013, the museum launched the online catalogue raisonné. The site focuses on the artist&#x27;s creative process and places Bourgeois&#x27;s prints and illustrated books within the context of her overall production by including related works in other mediums that deal with the same themes and imagery.

===Themes and critique===
One theme of Bourgeois&#x27;s work is that of childhood trauma and hidden emotion. After Louise&#x27;s mother became sick with influenza, Louise&#x27;s father began having affairs with other women, most notably with Sadie, Louise&#x27;s English tutor. He would bring mistresses back home and be unfaithful in front of his whole family. Louise was extremely watchful and aware of the situation. This was the beginning of the artist&#x27;s engagement with double standards related to gender and sexuality, which was expressed in much of her work. She recalls her father saying &quot;I love you&quot; repeatedly to her mother, despite infidelity. &quot;He was the wolf, and she was the rational hare, forgiving and accepting him as he was.&quot;

Motherhood is another recurrent theme of Bourgeois&#x27;s work. It was her mother who encouraged Bourgeois to draw and who involved her in the tapestry business. Bourgeois considered her mother to be intellectual and methodical; the continued motif of the spider in her work often represents her mother. The notion of a spider that spins and weaves its web is a direct reference to her parents&#x27; tapestry business and can also be seen as a metaphor for her mother, who repairs things.

Bourgeois has explored the concept of femininity through challenging the patriarchal standards and making artwork about motherhood rather than showing women as muses or ideals. She has been described as the &#x27;reluctant hero of feminist art&#x27;. Bourgeois had a feminist approach to her work similar to fellow artists such as Agnes Martin and Eva Hesse, less driven by the political but rather made work that drew on their experiences of gender and sexuality, naturally engaging with women&#x27;s issues.

Architecture and memory are important components of Bourgeois&#x27;s work. Bourgeois&#x27;s work are very organic, biological, reproductive feel to them; they draw attention to the work itself. Bourgeois describes architecture as a visual expression of memory, or memory as a type of architecture. The memory which is featured in much of her work is an invented memory – about the death or exorcism of her father. The imagined memory is interwoven with her real memories including living across from a slaughterhouse and her father&#x27;s affair. To Louise her father represented injury and war, aggrandizement of himself and belittlement of others and most importantly a man who represented betrayal.

Bourgeois&#x27;s work is powered by confessions, self-portraits, memories, fantasies of a restless being who is seeking through her sculpture a peace and an order which were missing throughout her childhood.

The art critic Christopher Allen described Bourgeois in &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper in 2024 as &quot;chronically overrated&quot; and as &quot;a mediocre artist raised by the institutional demand for a &#x27;modern master&#x27; to a level at which her weakness and inadequacy are inescapably apparent.&quot;

=== Collaboration ===

==== &quot;Do Not Abandon Me&quot; ====
This collaboration took place over a span of two years with British artist Tracey Emin. The work was exhibited in London months after Bourgeois&#x27;s death in 2010. The subject matter consists of male and female images. Although they appear sexual, it portrays a tiny female figure paying homage to a giant male figure, like a God. Bourgeois did the water colors and Tracey Emin did the drawing on top. It took Emin two years to decide how to figure out what she would contribute in the collaboration. When she knew what to do, she finished all of the drawings in a day and believes every single one worked out perfectly. &quot;I Lost You&quot; is about losing children, losing life. Bourgeois had to bury her son as a parent. Abandonment for her is not only about losing her mother but her son as well. Despite the age gap between the two artists and differences in their work, the collaboration worked out gently and easily.

== Notable exhibitions and site-specific projects (selection) ==
Bourgeois&#x27; work continues to be exhibited in museums and public spaces through the shape of site-specific installations around the world. For example, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA), North Adams, has presented a collection of the artist&#x27;s pieces in marble and other materials for nearly a decade.

The large-scale sculpture &quot;Maman&quot;, acquired by the Itaú Cultural Institute in 1996 and lent to the São Paulo Museum of Modern Art, Brazil, was sent on a multi-city tour to institutions and public areas such as the Inhotim Institute in Minas Gerais, the Iberê Camargo Foundation in Porto Alegre, and then to the Oscar Niemeyer Museum in Curitiba.

In 2020, Bourgeois work was featured in a major group show at the Pérez Art Museum Miami, Florida. &quot;My Body, My Rules&quot;, presented an investigating about the diverse artistic practices of 23 female-identified artists in the 21st-century. Carolee Schneemann, Cindy Sherman, Lorna Simpson, Ana Mendieta, Wanguechi Mutu, Mickalene Thomas, and Francesca Woodman, were among them.

Bourgeois was among those notable women artists. This image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became &quot;one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement&quot;.
*1977: Honorary doctorate from Yale University
*1981: Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
*1990: Elected into National Academy of Design

<text>Langtry is an unincorporated community in Val Verde County, Texas, United States. The community is notable as the place where Judge Roy Bean, the &quot;Law West of the Pecos&quot;, had his saloon and practiced law.

==History==
Langtry was originally established in 1882 by the Southern Pacific Railroad as a grading camp called Eagle Nest. It was later renamed for George Langtry, an engineer and foreman, who supervised the immigrant Chinese work crews building the railroad in the area.

Roy Bean arrived soon after completion of the railroad, and set up a tent saloon on company land. He later built a wooden structure for his saloon, which he called The Jersey Lilly after the well-known British actress Lillie Langtry. She was a native of the island of Jersey. (Née Le Breton, Langtry was her married name, and she was not related to George Langtry.) Bean used the saloon as his headquarters when authorized as a justice of the peace and notary public. He called himself the &quot;Law West of the Pecos&quot;. After a notable career as justice of the peace, Bean died in 1903.

In 1884, the town was authorized a post office. In 1892, it had a general store, a railroad depot, and two saloons. Langtry began to decline after the highway was moved slightly north in the early 1900s for a more direct east-west route. Once bypassed, the town&#x27;s businesses lost revenue and jobs. In the 1920s, Southern Pacific moved its facilities away, more jobs were lost, and the town population dwindled to 50.

By the 1970s, its population dipped as low as 40. Tourism to the Judge Roy Bean Visitor Center continues to keep the town alive.

==Transportation==

Langtry is located along US 90. 

There are no transportation services that directly serve Langtry. The nearest transportation option is served by Amtrak’s Sunset Limited, which passes through the town on Union Pacific tracks on the Sanderson Subdivision, but makes no stop. A stop is located 60 miles (96 km) northwest in Sanderson, or 60 miles (96 km) southeast in Del Rio.

==Education==
It was formerly in the Langtry Common School District, but sometime prior to 1976 the Langtry district merged into the Comstock Independent School District. In 1964 Langtry&#x27;s student count exceeded 60.

The whole county is served by Southwest Texas Junior College according to the Texas Education Code.

==Archeology==

Found on Mile Canyon right near Langtry is Bonfire Shelter, an archeological site that has yielded bones from butchered animals, including bison, driven to their deaths over the cliff by Native Americans thousands of years ago.

<doc id="604123" wikidata="Q1068734" url="?curid=604123" title="HAL Laboratory">
<text>formerly shortened as HALKEN, is a Japanese video game developer founded on February 21, 1980, in Chiyoda, Tokyo by Mitsuhiro Ikeda. The company started out developing games for home computers of the era, but has since established a strong relationship with Nintendo, and is often referred to as a second-party developer. In 1991, a second office in Kai, Yamanashi was established. The company is best known for its work on the &quot;Kirby&quot; and &quot;Mother&quot; series, and the first two &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; games.

Its logo, which depicts a dog incubating eggs, is meant to represent &quot;an unexpected bond [...] one that brings the birth of something new.&quot;

==History==
HAL Laboratory was founded on February 21, 1980, and originally developed games for home computers, such as the MSX and VIC-20. There have been conflicting claims on the origin of the company&#x27;s name. During a GDC 2005 keynote, Satoru Iwata stated that HAL was named after the computer from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. However, in a 2012 Iwata Asks interview, he said the company was named HAL because &quot;each letter put [them] one step ahead of IBM.&quot;

In 1984, the company began its business relationship with Nintendo. HAL assisted in the development of first-party Famicom games such as &quot;Pinball&quot; and &quot;Golf&quot;, while also creating original titles such as &quot;F1 Race&quot;. In the west, some titles were published under HAL America Inc. (HAI), a North American subsidiary of the company led by Yash Terakura and based in Beaverton, Oregon, USA.

In 1992, following the protracted development of &quot;Metal Slader Glory&quot;, the company was on the verge of bankruptcy. Nintendo offered to rescue HAL on the condition that Satoru Iwata were to be appointed its president, a role he took from 1993 to 2000.

The company&#x27;s current logo, Inutamago, was created in 1998 by Shigesato Itoi. The imagery is meant to represent &quot;an unexpected bond [...] one that brings the birth of something new&quot;. Reception was reportedly lukewarm at first.

In August 2001, HAL Laboratory and Nintendo jointly established Warpstar, Inc., a company created to oversee &quot;Kirby&quot; merchandising and outside media, such as the &quot;&quot; anime series.

In 2017, HAL Laboratory announced that the company would start developing games for mobile devices under the brand name HAL Egg, in order to clearly differentiate them from the company&#x27;s usual output. The first title released under the brand name was &quot;Part Time UFO&quot;. The company released miniature versions of the MZ-80C and PC-8001 computers in October 2017 and October 2019, respectively.

<doc id="604125" wikidata="Q855618" url="?curid=604125" title="Speckled pigeon">
<text>The speckled pigeon (Columba guinea), also African rock pigeon or Guinea pigeon, is a pigeon that is a resident breeding bird in much of Africa south of the Sahara. It is a common and widespread species in open habitats over much of its range, although there are sizable gaps in its distribution. It is sometimes referred to as the Guinea pigeon due to its similar coloring to some species of guineafowl.

==Taxonomy==
In 1747 the English naturalist George Edwards included a description and an illustration of the speckled pigeon in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. His hand-coloured etching was made from two live birds at the home of the Duke of Richmond in London. Edwards was told that the pigeons had been brought from the inland region of Guinea in West Africa. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the speckled pigeon with all the other pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Columba guinea&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work.

There are two recognised subspecies:
* &quot;C. g. guinea&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 – Mauritania to Ethiopia south to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and northern Malawi
* &quot;C. g. phaeonota&quot; Gray, G.R., 1856 – southwestern Angola to Zimbabwe and South Africa

==Description==
This is a large pigeon at 41 cm in length. Its back and wings are rufous, the latter heavily speckled with white spots. The rest of the upperparts and underparts are blue-grey, and the head is grey with red patches around the eye. The neck is brownish, streaked with white, and the legs are red. Sexes are similar, but immatures are browner than adults and lack the red eye patches. The call is a loud &quot;doo-doo-doo&quot;.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The speckled pigeon is frequently seen around human habitation and cultivation. Most of its food is vegetable, and it gathers in large numbers where grain or groundnuts are available. This species builds a large stick nest on protected rocky outcrops and in urban areas often atop covered pergola pillars and on flat roofs under deep eaves and lays two white eggs. Its flight is quick, with regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings that are characteristic of pigeons in general.

<text>Richard Zedník (born 6 January 1976) is a Slovak former professional ice hockey winger. He had a 15-year career in the National Hockey League (NHL), playing for the Washington Capitals, Montreal Canadiens, New York Islanders and Florida Panthers.

In February 2008, Zedník sustained a life-threatening injury during an NHL game when the skate of his teammate Olli Jokinen accidentally sliced his common carotid artery.

== Playing career ==
Zedník was drafted in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the Washington Capitals, in the tenth round, 249th overall, after playing junior hockey for the Portland Winter Hawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL).

Zedník scored 35 goals in his rookie year with the Winter Hawks during the 1994–95 season. In his second year with the major junior team, he scored 44 goals which earned him Second Team All-Star honours. Zedník made his professional debut at the end of the 1995–96 season, playing in a single game with the Capitals before joining their minor league affiliate, the Portland Pirates of the American Hockey League (AHL), for their Calder Cup finals playoff run. Zedník made the Capitals&#x27; roster out of training camp in 1996 and scored his first career NHL goal in the season opener on October 5 against Ed Belfour of the Chicago Blackhawks. After one goal in nine games, Zedník was sent down to Portland before being recalled briefly in March 1997.

Zedník played his first full NHL season in 1997–98, playing in 65 games with the Capitals and recording 17 goals. Zedník scored the first Capitals goal in Capital One Arena (then MCI Center) history.

On October 31, 2000, a local Washington, D.C., radio station, DC101, had a promotion in which they offered fans a free ticket and Zedník jersey if they dyed their hair blond as Zedník had in the off-season. Two hundred fans with dyed hair attended the game, at which Zedník scored his first career hat-trick against the Detroit Red Wings, who had not lost in Washington in ten years.

After spending six seasons with the Capitals, Zedník was traded during the 2000–01 season, along with Jan Bulis and a first-round draft pick (used to select Alexander Perezhogin), to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Trevor Linden, Dainius Zubrus and a second-round draft pick (later traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning) on March 13, 2001.

On April 26, 2002, during a playoff game in Montreal against the Boston Bruins, Zedník was elbowed in the face by Bruins defenceman Kyle McLaren. Zedník suffered a fractured cheekbone, broken nose and a concussion. Despite the Canadiens losing the game 5–2 and Zedník for the remainder of the playoffs, they would win the series 4–2.

After playing the next three years in Montreal, Zedník was traded back to the Capitals on July 12, 2006, in exchange for a third-round draft pick. Zedník&#x27;s second stint back with the Capitals was short as he was dealt at the trade deadline to the New York Islanders for a second-round draft pick on February 26, 2007.

At the conclusion of the 2006–07 season, Zedník, a free agent, signed a two-year contract with the Florida Panthers on July 1, 2007.

On April 30, 2009, Zedník was announced as a Masterton Trophy finalist for the 2008–09 season. His nomination coincided with an official announcement that Zedník signed to play for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) for the 2009–10 season. Zedník&#x27;s contract with Lokomotiv Yaroslaval was terminated &quot;by mutual agreement&quot; in the summer of 2010.

Zedník then played two games with HC 05 Banská Bystrica of the Slovak Extraliga. On January 10, 2011, he signed a contract with AIK IF, which expired after the 2010–11 Elitserien season.

=== Neck injury ===
On February 10, 2008, in a game where the Florida Panthers were playing the Buffalo Sabres, Zedník suffered a severe and life-threatening injury. Teammate Olli Jokinen was tangled up with Sabre Clarke MacArthur and lost his balance in front of Zedník. Zedník was skating past as Jokinen fell, and his skate blade accidentally made contact with Zedník&#x27;s neck, slicing his common carotid artery open and causing it to expel a trail of blood onto the ice as Zedník reacted quickly and skated to the Panthers&#x27; bench. He was immediately attended to by Florida trainer Dave Zenobi, who took him to the locker room for treatment. Paramedics, who are on standby at every NHL game, stabilized Zedník while the home team doctor Les Bisson controlled the bleeding. Bisson noted that Zedník appeared to be in shock but was not near death, as he was alert and responsive. Zedník lost five pints of blood (2.3 L). He was transported to hospital on emergency run, his status being published as stable after leaving the arena. The game was delayed for more than 20 minutes as the Zamboni was needed to help remove the blood from the ice. The announcement over the public address speakers at HSBC Arena that Zedník was in stable condition and &quot;en route&quot; to a Buffalo, New York, hospital sparked a prolonged standing ovation from the Buffalo fans as the game went on as planned.

Emergency surgery was performed to repair the artery, but according to doctors at Buffalo General Hospital, Zedník&#x27;s life was not in jeopardy. The artery was not severed; had it been, it would have recessed into the neck, requiring more extensive surgery to repair. Zedník was in the intensive care unit through February 12, then released from hospital on February 16, but missed the rest of the season recovering from the injury. He returned to play in the 2008–09 season.

Zedník&#x27;s injury drew comparisons with a similar injury suffered in 1989 by Clint Malarchuk, who was a goalkeeper for the Buffalo Sabres. Both injuries prompted discussion about neck guards and player safety in the NHL. At present, team doctors (practitioners of sports medicine) are trained in trauma care and are required to be seated behind the home team bench at every game.

== Personal life ==
Zedník married French-Canadian actress Jessica Welch in 2005. They divorced in 2009 and have one daughter.

<doc id="604133" wikidata="Q1418483" url="?curid=604133" title="Geraint Howells">
<text>Geraint Wyn Howells, Baron Geraint (15 April 1925 – 17 April 2004) was a Welsh politician of the Liberal Party and its successor, the Liberal Democrats. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardigan from 1974 to 1983 and Ceredigion and Pembroke North from 1983 to 1992.

==Early life and education==
Howells was born in Ponterwyd, Cardiganshire, in 1925. He was the son of David John and Mary Blodwen Howells, both farmers. He was educated at Ponterwyd Primary School and Ardwyn Grammar School, Aberystwyth. 

==Pre-parliamentary career==

Howells&#x27; main living was as a hill farmer in Glennydd, Ponterwyd in Ceredgion. He held some 750 acres there with around 3,000 sheep. The majority were prize winning Speckled Faces. Howells was also a champion sheep shearer. He held senior positions in the British Wool Marketing Board and was also chairman of the Wool Producers of Wales, 1977–1983. Politically, Howells was elected to Cardiganshire County Council as an Independent in 1952, defeating the sitting member by twelve votes. At this time it was normal practice in Welsh rural counties for Liberal members to stand as independents.

However, in 1958 he was briefly appointed as agent for the prospective Labour candidate for Cardiganshire, Loti Rees Hughes.

==Parliamentary career==
Howells was selected as the parliamentary candidate for Brecon and Radnor in 1968. He was the first Liberal to contest the seat in the post-war period. He came third with 18.9 per cent of the vote. During this period Howells became one of the central players in the Welsh Liberal Party.

In 1972 Howells was selected as the parliamentary candidate for Cardiganshire, a seat with a longstanding Liberal tradition. It had been held by the Liberal MP, Roderic Bowen, until his defeat by Labour&#x27;s Elystan Morgan in 1966. In the February 1974 general election Howells defeated Morgan and retained the constituency in several different forms until 1992. Thus he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Cardigan (1974–1983) and Ceredigion and Pembroke North (1983–1992) after boundary changes. Howells was the Liberal Party&#x27;s spokesman on Welsh Affairs (1979–1987) and agriculture (1987–92). His Westminster secretary and agent was Judi Lewis (Welsh Liberal Democrat chief executive 1992–1997) whilst one of his researchers was Mark Williams who would later win the seat for the Liberal Democrats in 2005.

In 1992, Howells unexpectedly lost his seat to Plaid Cymru (which moved from fourth place to first). Plaid Cymru had formed an alliance with the Wales Green Party which attracted considerable support from non-Welsh speakers in the constituency. Howells was made a life peer as Baron Geraint, of Ponterwyd in the County of Dyfed. Howells was a close friend of both Richard Livsey and Emlyn Hooson, both of whom he served with at Westminster in the House of Commons and the House of Lords.

Howells was passionately pro-devolution. He played a lead role in the 1979 devolution campaign in Wales. He was also able to get the Farmers Union of Wales (FUW) recognition as one of the official unions for government negotiations during the Lib-Lab pact on the 1970s.

==Personal life==
Geraint Howells married Mary Olwen Griffiths on 7 September 1957. They had two children: Gaenor, a newsreader with the BBC World Service, born in 1961 and Mari born in 1965.

Howells died in Aberystwyth on 17 April 2004, two days after his 79th birthday.

<text>MTV Select was an interactive music television program airing on MTV channels across Europe and later on MTV Japan, MTV Canada, and MTV India. The show was hosted by a VJ, and viewers were able to contact the programme (using technologies like SMS) to request a music video from a list of songs chosen by the show&#x27;s producers.

==History==
&quot;MTV Select&quot; launched in 1997 after a similar series &quot;Dial MTV&quot; aired between 1996 and 1997 on MTV Europe. Upon launch &quot;MTV Select&quot; was available across Europe on MTV Europe. As MTV began to regionalize the channel across Europe it launched regional versions of the program including &quot;MTV Select&quot; German, Italian, UK, and pan-European versions that aired on local MTV channels: MTV Germany, MTV UK and Ireland, MTV Italy and the original European channel MTV Europe. The program was created during a transitional period in MTV&#x27;s history when it was moving away from music videos into other kinds of programming, and it was said that the channel is &quot;in search of a new identity&quot;. Shows were increasingly being centered around recognizable personalities—UK version of &quot;MTV Select&quot; was led by Richard Blackwood, described as MTV&#x27;s &quot;current brightest star&quot;, and Donna Air. However only a marginal increase in viewership, from 0.9% to 1.1%, was recorded in 1998 in the UK. Regardless, toward the end of its runtime it was described in Digital Spy as &quot;UK and Ireland&#x27;s favourite music request show&quot;.

&quot;MTV Select&quot; would later launch regional versions in Spain, France, Poland, and Romania. MTV Networks Europe eventually replaced &quot;MTV Select&quot; with the US version of &quot;MTV TRL&quot;. Prior to MTV Select finishing MTV channels in Italy, Germany, UK and Romania already had their own versions of &quot;MTV TRL&quot;.

&quot;MTV Select&quot; appeared on MTV Japan in 2000 and was later replaced. The show was reportedly a big hit on MTV India, where the show format was to telecast live user requests, received through phone calls or e-mails. For several years since its launch it was hosted by Rahul Khanna.

With the launch of MTV Canada, a Canadian version of &quot;MTV Select&quot; aired on A-Channel, MTV Canada, and Toronto One. Hosted by Amanda MacKay and Brian Adler and taped in Vancouver, British Columbia, the show featured interviews with bands and singers, video requests, and a countdown of the ten songs that received the most votes at the &quot;Select&quot; website, starting at Number 10 on Monday and ending at Number 1 on Friday. When MTV Canada was rebranded as &quot;Razer&quot;, the show was renamed &quot;969&quot;.

MTV was one of the early adopters of SMS use during live shows. In 2001, the program was noted as one of the ways MTV hoped to capitalize on the &quot;text messaging mania&quot;. It was said that the benefit of the interactive format, compared to the internet, is that viewers aren&#x27;t dragged away from the TV.

Today, most European MTVs no longer have live studio-based interactive request shows.

<text>Laughlin Air Force Base is a facility of the United States Air Force located east of Del Rio, Texas. 

==Overview==
Laughlin AFB, the largest pilot training base in the US Air Force, is home to the 47th Flying Training Wing of the Air Education and Training Command and the 96th Flying Training Squadron of the Air Force Reserve Command. On weekdays, the airfield sees more takeoffs and landings than any other airport in the country.

==History==

=== Laughlin Army Air Field ===
Laughlin AFB was originally named Laughlin Army Air Field on March 3, 1943, after Jack T. Laughlin, a B-17E Flying Fortress pilot. He was trained as a pilot and was actually co-pilot of B-17E, tail number 41-2476. On the day of his first bombing mission, he was bumped by the Group Commander Major Stanley K. Robinson (Robinson was co-pilot next to pilot Capt. Walter W. Sparks). Major Robinson brought along his own combat-experienced navigator, Lt. Richard Cease. Laughlin had no assigned position on the plane for the mission. He became Del Rio&#x27;s first World War II casualty when the plane he was flying in (most likely as a waist gunner for the mission) was lost at sea, having succumbed to damage received over the Makassar Strait on 29 (or 28) January 1942. The damage occurred during two bombing runs against Japanese warships and transports in the Makassar Strait off the coast of Balikpapan, Borneo. The field became simply Laughlin Field on November 11, 1943, and later an U.S. Army Air Forces Auxiliary Field. During World War II, Laughlin&#x27;s primary mission was the training of B-26 Marauder pilots and aircrews. It was closed in October 1945.

=== Laughlin Air Force Base ===
Laughlin Air Force Base reopened on May 1, 1952. In October 1952, ATC transferred the base to Crew Training Air Force (CREWTAF) and activated the 3645th Flying Training Wing (Fighter), as a combat crew replacement training facility for pilots headed for Korea. Training provided new pilots with basic bombing and gunnery combat skills in the F-80 Shooting Star, F-84 Thunderjet, and T-33 jet aircraft, but within short time crews used only the T-33. In September 1955, Laughlin came under the control of the Flying Training Air Force and switched missions with Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. Laughlin undertook single-engine pilot training, still using the T-33.

==== Strategic Air Command ====
The U.S. Air Force transferred jurisdiction of the base to the Strategic Air Command on April 1, 1957, and the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (Light) moved there from Turner Air Force Base, Georgia. Following the graduation of the last class in March 1957, ATC inactivated the 3645th FTW. The 4080th Wing provided high-altitude reconnaissance and air sampling using the Lockheed U-2A and the RB-57D Canberra. The 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing was redesignated as the 4080th Strategic Wing on June 15, 1960, and the RB-57 mission was phased out.

Laughlin U-2s were among the first to provide photographic evidence of Soviet missile installations in Cuba in 1962 when 4080th U-2 pilot major Steve Heyser flew his U-2C over Cuba after taking off from Edwards AFB, California. Heyser landed at McCoy AFB, Florida, following the mission, with McCoy becoming a U-2 operating location for the duration of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The film from Major Heyser&#x27;s mission was developed, analyzed and the photos were shown to the United Nations Security Council on October 22, 1962, proving to the world, that offensive missiles were on the island of Cuba.
Another 4080th pilot, Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., perished when his U-2 was hit by shrapnel from a Soviet-made SA-2 surface-to-air missile on October 22, 1962, while overflying Cuba from McCoy AFB. While the U-2 did not suffer a direct hit, Anderson was struck by fragments from the proximity fused warhead&#x27;s explosion which penetrated and compromised his pressure suit (at altitude, unconsciousness and death came very quickly). His body was returned to the U.S. following the crisis, still clad in its pressure suit. Major Anderson posthumously became the first recipient of the Air Force Cross. Laughlin&#x27;s primary operations training complex, Anderson Hall, is named in his honor.

==== Air Training Command ====
In 1961, Headquarters U.S. Air Force notified Laughlin officials their mission would expand to again include an Air Training Command undergraduate pilot training program. Plans called to transfer in about half the student load from Laredo Air Force Base, Texas. ATC reactivated the 3645th Pilot Training Wing (later redesignated 3646th Pilot Training Wing) at Laughlin in October 1961 to prepare for the phase-in of students and T-37 and T-33 trainers. The 4080th SW continued at Laughlin as a tenant organization until 1963.

Today, aircraft flown at Laughlin include the T-6A Texan II, the T-38C Talon and T-1A Jayhawk. Fifteen classes of approximately 20–25 pilots graduate annually.

<text>Infarction is tissue death (necrosis) due to inadequate blood supply to the affected area. It may be caused by artery blockages, rupture, mechanical compression, or vasoconstriction. The resulting lesion is referred to as an infarct
(from the Latin &quot;infarctus&quot;, &quot;stuffed into&quot;).

==Causes==

Infarction occurs as a result of prolonged ischemia, which is the insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrition to an area of tissue due to a disruption in blood supply. The blood vessel supplying the affected area of tissue may be blocked due to an obstruction in the vessel (e.g., an arterial embolus, thrombus, or atherosclerotic plaque), compressed by something outside of the vessel causing it to narrow (e.g., tumor, volvulus, or hernia), ruptured by trauma causing a loss of blood pressure downstream of the rupture, or vasoconstricted, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel by contraction of the muscle wall rather than an external force (e.g., cocaine vasoconstriction leading to myocardial infarction).

Hypertension and atherosclerosis are risk factors for both atherosclerotic plaques and thromboembolism. In atherosclerotic formations, a plaque develops under a fibrous cap. When the fibrous cap is degraded by metalloproteinases released from macrophages or by intravascular shear force from blood flow, subendothelial thrombogenic material (extracellular matrix) is exposed to circulating platelets and thrombus formation occurs on the vessel wall occluding blood flow. Occasionally, the plaque may rupture and form an embolus which travels with the blood-flow downstream to where the vessel narrows and eventually clogs the vessel lumen.

==Classification==
===By histopathology===

Infarctions are divided into two types according to the amount of blood present:
# White infarctions (anemic infarcts) affect solid organs such as the spleen, heart and kidneys wherein the solidity of the tissue substantially limits the amount of nutrients (blood/oxygen/glucose/fuel) that can flow into the area of ischaemic necrosis. Similar occlusion to blood flow and consequent necrosis can occur as a result of severe vasoconstriction as illustrated in severe Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon that can lead to irreversible gangrene.
# Red infarctions (hemorrhagic infarcts) generally affect the lungs or other loose organs (testis, ovary, small intestines). The occlusion consists more of red blood cells and fibrin strands. Characteristics of red infarcts include:
#* occlusion of a vein
#* loose tissues that allow blood to collect in the infarcted zone
#* tissues with a dual circulatory system (lung, small intestines)
#* tissues previously congested from sluggish venous outflow
#* reperfusion (injury) of previously ischemic tissue that is associated with reperfusion-related diseases, such as myocardial infarction, stroke (cerebral infarction), shock-resuscitation, replantation surgery, frostbite, burns, and organ transplantation.
===By localization===
* Heart: Myocardial infarction (&quot;MI&quot;), commonly known as a &quot;heart attack&quot;, is an infarction of the heart, causing some heart cells to die. This is most commonly due to occlusion (blockage) of a coronary artery following the rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which is an unstable collection of lipids (fatty acids) and white blood cells (especially macrophages) in the wall of an artery. The resulting ischemia (restriction in blood supply) and oxygen shortage, if left untreated for a sufficient period of time, can cause damage or kill heart muscle tissue (&quot;myocardium&quot;).

* Brain: Cerebral infarction is the ischemic kind of stroke due to a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain. It can be atherothrombotic or embolic. Stroke caused by cerebral infarction should be distinguished from two other kinds of stroke: cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cerebral infarctions vary in their severity with one third of the cases resulting in death. In response to ischemia, the brain degenerates by the process of liquefactive necrosis.
* Lung: Pulmonary infarction or lung infarction
* Spleen: Splenic infarction occurs when the splenic artery or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a blood clot. Although it can occur asymptomatically, the typical symptom is severe pain in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, sometimes radiating to the left shoulder. Fever and chills develop in some cases. It has to be differentiated from other causes of acute abdomen.
* Limb: Limb infarction is an infarction of an arm or leg. Causes include arterial embolisms and &quot;skeletal muscle infarction&quot; as a rare complication of long standing, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. A major presentation is painful thigh or leg swelling.
* Bone: Infarction of bone results in avascular necrosis. Without blood, the bone tissue dies and the bone collapses. If avascular necrosis involves the bones of a joint, it often leads to destruction of the joint articular surfaces (see osteochondritis dissecans).
* Testicle: an infarction of a testicle is commonly caused by testicular torsion and may require removal of the affected testicle(s) if not undone by surgery quickly enough.

* Eye: an infarction can occur to the central retinal artery which supplies the retina causing sudden visual loss.
*Bowel: Bowel infarction is generally caused by mesenteric ischemia due to blockages in the arteries or veins that supply the bowel.

==Associated diseases==

Diseases commonly associated with infarctions include:

* Peripheral artery occlusive disease (the most severe form of which is gangrene)
* Antiphospholipid syndrome
* Sepsis
* Giant-cell arteritis (GCA)
* Hernia
* Volvulus
* Sickle-cell disease

== First aid ==
Each type of infarction requires its own care.

Infarction in the heart requires first aid for myocardial infarction (due to acute coronary syndrome).

Infarction in the brain requires first aid for stroke (using a protocol named F.A.S.T.).

<text>Thomas Ollive Mabbott (July 6, 1898 – May 15, 1968) was an American professor and scholar of literature, perhaps best known for his research on writer Edgar Allan Poe. He has also done studies on John Milton, Walt Whitman, Thomas Chatterton, and Edward Coote Pinkney.

==Biography==
Mabbott was born and raised in New York City. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Columbia University, earning his AB (1920), AM (1921), and Ph.D. (1923) in English. After graduating from Columbia, Mabbott taught English literature and composition at Northwestern University. In 1928, he left Northwestern to teach at Brown. He was there for one year before accepting a position at Hunter College in New York City. Mabbott remained at Hunter as a professor of English and research scholar until 1966. His final two years were spent as a visiting professor at St. John&#x27;s University.

He may be best remembered as an expert on Edgar Allan Poe, whose works he was in the process of compiling when he died on May 15, 1968, at the age of 69. During his studies, he identified some poetry of Poe originally published anonymously as well as never published manuscripts. His wife took over the project after his death and saw it through to completion.

In 1967, during research for &quot;The Complete Works of Poe&quot;, Mabbott discovered a lost Walt Whitman poem titled &quot;No Turning Back&quot;, one of only four he is known to have written in 1842.

Mabbott also appreciated the horror writing of H. P. Lovecraft. One of his essays on Lovecraft can be found in &quot;Lovecraft Remembered&quot;.

<text>The Doors is a 1991 American biographical film directed by Oliver Stone and written by Stone and Randall Jahnson. It is based on the history of American rock band the Doors and their influence on music and counterculture. The film stars Val Kilmer as singer Jim Morrison, Meg Ryan as Morrison&#x27;s girlfriend Pamela Courson, Kyle MacLachlan as keyboardist Ray Manzarek, Frank Whaley as lead guitarist Robby Krieger, Kevin Dillon as drummer John Densmore, Billy Idol as Cat, and Kathleen Quinlan as journalist Patricia Kennealy.

The film portrays Morrison as a larger-than-life icon of 1960s rock and roll and counterculture, including portrayals of Morrison&#x27;s recreational drug use, free love, hippie lifestyle, alcoholism, interest in hallucinogenic drugs as entheogens, and his growing obsession with death, presented as threads which weave in and out of the film.

Released by Tri-Star Pictures on March 1, 1991, &quot;The Doors&quot; grossed $34 million in the United States and Canada on a $32 million production budget. The film received mixed reviews from critics; while Kilmer&#x27;s performance, the supporting cast, the cinematography, the production design and Stone&#x27;s directing were praised, criticism was centered on its historical inaccuracy and depiction of Morrison.

== Plot ==

In 1949, young Jim Morrison and his family are traveling on a desert highway in New Mexico where they encounter an auto wreck and see an elderly Native American dying by the roadside. In 1965, Jim arrives in California and is assimilated into the Venice Beach culture. During his tenure studying at UCLA, he meets Pamela Courson and they fall in love, becoming a couple. He also meets Ray Manzarek for the first time, as well as Robby Krieger and John Densmore, who form the Doors with Morrison.

Jim convinces his bandmates to travel to Death Valley and experience the effects of psychedelic drugs. Returning to Los Angeles, they play several shows at the famous Whisky a Go Go nightclub and develop a rabid fanbase. Jim&#x27;s onstage antics and lewd performance of the group&#x27;s song &quot;The End&quot; upset the club&#x27;s owners, and the band is ejected from the venue. After the show, they are approached by producer Paul A. Rothchild and Jac Holzman of Elektra Records and are offered a deal to record their first album. The Doors are soon invited to perform on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, only to be told by one of the producers that they must change the lyric &quot;girl we couldn&#x27;t get much higher&quot; in the song &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, due to a reference to drugs. Despite this, Morrison performs the original lyric during the live broadcast and the band is not allowed to perform on the show again.

As the Doors&#x27; success continues, Jim becomes increasingly infatuated with his own image as &quot;The Lizard King&quot; and develops an addiction to alcohol and drugs. Jim becomes intimate with rock journalist Patricia Kennealy, who involves him in her witchcraft activities, participating in a mystical handfasting ceremony. Meanwhile, an elder spirit watches these events.

The rest of the band grows weary of Jim&#x27;s missed recording sessions and absences at concerts. Jim arrives late and intoxicated to a Miami, Florida concert, becoming increasingly confrontational towards the audience and threatening to expose himself onstage. The incident is a low point for the band, resulting in criminal charges against Jim, cancellations of shows, breakdowns in Jim&#x27;s personal relationships, and resentment from the other band members.

In 1970, following a lengthy trial, Jim is found guilty of indecent exposure and ordered to serve time in prison. However, he is allowed to remain free on bail, pending the results of an appeal. Patricia tells Jim that she is pregnant with his child, but Jim convinces her to have an abortion. Jim visits his bandmates for the final time, attending a birthday party hosted by Ray where he wishes the band luck in their future endeavors and gives each of them a copy of his poetry book &quot;An American Prayer&quot;. As Jim plays in the front garden with the children, he sees that one of them is his childhood self and comments, &quot;This is the strangest life I&#x27;ve ever known&quot; (a lyric from the Doors song &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;), before passing out.

In 1971, Jim and Pam move to Paris, France, to escape the pressures of the L.A. lifestyle. On the evening of July 3, Pam finds Jim dead in the bathtub of their apartment. He is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery, besides other famous figures as Oscar Wilde, Marcel Proust and Moliere. Pam also dies three years later at the age of 27.

== Cast ==
Additionally Jennifer Tilly played the part of Okie girl but her scenes were deleted from the final film.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

Film directors Quentin Tarantino, Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin had all flirted with making a Doors biopic over the years. In 1985, Columbia Pictures acquired the rights from the Doors and the Morrison estate to make a film. Producer Sasha Harari wanted filmmaker Oliver Stone to write the screenplay but never heard back from his agent. After two unsatisfactory scripts were produced, Imagine Films replaced Columbia. Harari contacted Stone again and the director met with the surviving band members, telling them he wanted to keep a particularly wild scene from one of the early drafts. The group was offended by this and exercised their right of approval over the director, rejecting Stone.

By 1989, Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna, who owned Carolco Pictures, had acquired the rights to the project and wanted Stone to direct it. The Doors had seen Stone&#x27;s film &quot;Platoon&quot; (1986) and were impressed with what he had done, and Stone agreed to make the film after his next project, &quot;Evita&quot;. After spending years working on &quot;Evita&quot; and courting both Madonna and Meryl Streep to play the titular role, the film fell apart over salary negotiations with Streep and Stone quickly moved into pre-production for &quot;The Doors&quot;.

Guitarist Robby Krieger had always opposed a Doors biopic until Stone signed on to direct. Conversely, keyboardist Ray Manzarek had traditionally been the biggest advocate of immortalizing the band on film but opposed Stone&#x27;s involvement. He was not happy with the direction that Stone was going to take with the film and refused to give his approval. According to actor Kyle MacLachlan, &quot;I know that he and Oliver weren&#x27;t speaking. I think it was hard for Ray, he being the keeper of the Doors myth for so long&quot;. According to Krieger, &quot;when the Doors broke up Ray had his idea of how the band should be portrayed and John and I had ours&quot;. Manzarek stated that he was not asked to consult on the film and wanted it to be about all four band members equally, rather than the focus being on Morrison. Conversely, Stone stated that he repeatedly tried to get Manzarek involved, but &quot;all he did was rave and shout. He went on for three hours about his point of view... I didn&#x27;t want Ray to be dominant, but Ray thought he knew better than anybody else&quot;. Krieger claimed in his book &quot;Set the Night on Fire&quot; that Manzarek was also jealous of Stone because he wanted to direct the film himself.

=== Screenplay ===
Stone first heard the Doors in 1967, when he was a 21-year-old soldier in Vietnam. Before filming started, Stone and his producers had to negotiate with the three surviving band members and their label, Elektra Records, as well as the parents of both Morrison and his girlfriend Pamela Courson. Morrison&#x27;s parents would only allow themselves to be depicted in a dream-like flashback sequence at the beginning of the film. The Coursons wanted there to be no suggestion in any way that Pamela caused Morrison&#x27;s death. Stone found the Coursons the most difficult to deal with because they wanted Pamela to be portrayed as &quot;an angel&quot;. While researching the film, Stone read through transcripts of interviews with over 100 people. Stone finally penned the film script in the summer of 1989, later stating that &quot;&quot;The Doors&quot; script was always problematic. Even when we shot, but the music helped fuse it together&quot;. Stone first picked the songs he wanted to use and then wrote &quot;each piece of the movie as a mood to fit that song&quot;. The Coursons did not like Stone&#x27;s script and tried to slow the production down by refusing to allow any of Morrison&#x27;s later poetry to be used in the film. (When Morrison died, Courson acquired the rights to Morrison&#x27;s poetry; when she died, her parents got the rights.)

=== Casting ===
For nearly 10 years prior to production, the project went through development hell after being considered by many studios and directors. Several actors, including Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, John Travolta and Richard Gere, were each considered for the role of Morrison when the project was still in development in the 1980s, with Bono of U2 and Michael Hutchence of INXS also expressing interest in the role. Stone initially offered the role to Ian Astbury of the Cult, who declined the role because he was not happy with the way Morrison was going to be represented in the film.

When Stone began talking about the project in 1988, he had Val Kilmer in mind to play Morrison, after seeing him in the Ron Howard fantasy film &quot;Willow&quot;. Kilmer had the same kind of singing voice as Morrison and, to convince Stone that he was right for the role, spent several thousand dollars of his own money and made his own eight-minute audition video, singing and looking like Morrison at various stages of his life. To prepare for the role, Kilmer lost weight and spent six months rehearsing Doors songs every day; the actor learned 50 songs, 15 of which are actually performed in the film. Kilmer also spent hundreds of hours with the Doors&#x27; producer Paul A. Rothchild, who related &quot;anecdotes, stories, tragic moments, humorous moments, how Jim thought... interpretation of Jim&#x27;s lyrics&quot;. Rothchild also took Kilmer into the studio and helped him with &quot;some pronunciations, idiomatic things that Jim would do that made the song sound like Jim&quot;. Kilmer also met with Krieger and Densmore but Manzarek refused to talk to him. When the Doors heard Kilmer singing they could not tell whether the voice was Kilmer&#x27;s or Morrison&#x27;s.

Stone auditioned approximately 60 actresses for the role of Pamela Courson. The role required nudity and the script featured sex scenes, which generated a fair amount of controversy. Casting director Risa Bramon felt that Patricia Arquette auditioned very well and should have gotten the role. To prepare for the role, Meg Ryan talked to the Coursons and people that knew Pamela. Before doing the film, she was not familiar with Morrison and &quot;liked a few songs&quot;, adding, &quot;I had to reexamine all my beliefs about [the 1960s] in order to do this movie&quot;. In doing research, she also encountered several conflicting views of Pamela.

Krieger acted as a technical advisor on the film, chiefly to show his cinematic alter ego, Frank Whaley, where to put his fingers on the guitar fretboard during the mimed performance sequences. Similarly, Densmore also acted as a consultant on the film, tutoring Kevin Dillon.

=== Principal photography ===
With a budget set at $32 million, &quot;The Doors&quot; was filmed over 13 weeks, predominantly in and around Los Angeles, California; Paris, France; New York City, New York; and the Mojave Desert. Stone originally hired Paula Abdul to choreograph the film&#x27;s concert scenes. She dropped out of the project because she did not understand Morrison&#x27;s on-stage actions and was not familiar with the time period. Abdul recommended Bill and Jacqui Landrum, who watched hours of concert footage before working with Kilmer and got him to do dance exercises to loosen up his upper body and jumping routines to develop his stamina.

During the concert scenes, Kilmer did his own singing, performing over the Doors&#x27; master tapes without Morrison&#x27;s lead vocals, avoiding lip-synching. Kilmer&#x27;s endurance was put to the test during the concert sequences, which took several days to film, with Stone stating, &quot;His voice would start to deteriorate after two or three takes. We had to take that into consideration.&quot; One sequence, filmed inside the Whisky a Go Go, proved to be more difficult than others due to all the smoke and sweat, a result of the body heat and intense camera lights. &quot;The End&quot; sequence took five days to shoot, after which Kilmer was completely exhausted.

Controversy arose during filming when a memo linked to Kilmer circulated among cast and crew members, listing rules of how the actor was to be treated for the duration of principal photography. These provisions forbade people to approach him on set without good reason, address him by his own name while he was in character or stare at him on set. An upset Stone contacted Kilmer&#x27;s agent and the actor claimed it was a misunderstanding and that the memo was for his own people and not the film crew.

=== Soundtrack ===

The film contains over two dozen of the Doors&#x27; songs, although only half of these appear on the accompanying soundtrack album. In the film, original recordings of the band are combined with vocal performances by Kilmer himself, although none of Kilmer&#x27;s performances appear on the soundtrack album. In addition, two songs by the Velvet Underground (&quot;Heroin&quot; and &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;) are heard throughout the film, with the former appearing on the soundtrack.

== Historicity ==

The film is based mostly on real people and actual events, with some segments reflecting Stone&#x27;s vision and dramatization of those people and events. For example, when Morrison is asked to change the lyric in &quot;Light My Fire&quot; for his appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, he is depicted as blatantly ignoring the request, defiantly shouting &quot;higher! Yeah!&quot; into the television camera. However, during the actual broadcast, Morrison simply sang the vocal with the same emphasis as on the record. Morrison later said the inclusion of &quot;higher&quot; in the live version was an accident, and that he had meant to change the lyric but was so nervous about performing on live television that he forgot. Conversely, Ray Manzarek said the Doors only pretended to agree to the changing of words and deliberately played the song as they always had, albeit without any added emphasis on the offending words.

Several acts of violence portrayed in the film are disputed: Morrison is depicted as locking Pamela Courson in a closet and setting it on fire; having an argument with Courson at a Thanksgiving celebration, where they both threaten each other with a knife; and angrily throwing a television set at Manzarek for licensing the use of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; in a Buick television commercial. Even though Manzarek was frank about Morrison&#x27;s tendency to go into senseless rages, participants in the film agree that none of these specific incidents occurred. Stone acknowledges in the DVD director&#x27;s commentary that the Thanksgiving scene never actually took place, nor the scene when the band members travel to a desert where Morrison encourages them to take psychedelic drugs.

Dialogue that took place between Morrison and Patricia Kennealy is misrepresented in scenes between Morrison and Pam Courson, with Courson speaking Kennealy&#x27;s words. Courson is also depicted as saying hostile things to Kennealy, when by Kennealy&#x27;s reports the interactions between the two women were polite. Kennealy is also portrayed as being the girl Morrison was with in the shower stall backstage before the December 9, 1967 New Haven concert (not 1968 as inscribed in the film), when in fact he was with a local teenage co-ed from Southern Connecticut State University. Additionally, the New Haven venue is presented in the film as an amphitheater with a large balcony and a packed audience, when in reality it was a rather decrepit, half-empty hockey rink with audience members sitting on folding wooden chairs. In the scene at a press conference set in New York City in 1967, when Kennealy is first introduced to Morrison, the singer is asked a question regarding &quot;the dreadful reviews your new poetry book has got&quot;; at that time, Morrison had not yet published any volumes of his poetry.

John Densmore is portrayed as hating Morrison when the singer&#x27;s personal and drug problems begin to dominate his behavior. However, Densmore states in his biography &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; that he never directly confronted Morrison about his drunken behavior.

In the concert sequences naked women are shown prancing around onstage, which Densmore said did not happen at any of the Doors&#x27; concerts. Krieger said that he did not take acid prior to the concert at the Dinner Key Auditorium in Miami on March 1, 1969 as depicted in the film.

The surviving Doors members were all, to one degree or another, unhappy with the final film. In a 1991 interview with Gary James, Manzarek criticized Stone for exaggerating Morrison&#x27;s alcohol consumption: &quot;Jim with a bottle all the time. It was ridiculous... It was not about Jim Morrison. It was about Jimbo Morrison, the drunk. God, where was the sensitive poet and the funny guy? The guy I knew was not on that screen.&quot; In the afterword of his book &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, Densmore says that the movie is based on &quot;the myth of Jim Morrison&quot; and criticizes the film for portraying Morrison&#x27;s ideas as &quot;muddled through the haze of the drink [alcohol]&quot;. In a 1994 interview, Krieger said that the film does not give the viewer &quot;any kind of understanding of what made Jim Morrison tick&quot;. Krieger added, &quot;They left a lot of stuff out. Some of it was overblown, but a lot of the stuff was very well done, I thought.&quot;

In Manzarek&#x27;s biography of the Doors, &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, he often criticizes Stone and his account of Morrison. For example, in Stone&#x27;s re-creation of Morrison&#x27;s student film at UCLA, Morrison watches a D-Day sequence on television and shouts profanities in German, with a near-nude German exchange student dancing on top of the television sporting a swastika armband. According to Manzarek, the only similarity between Stone&#x27;s version and Morrison&#x27;s was that the girl in question was German. Manzarek described Stone&#x27;s version as a &quot;grotesque exaggeration&quot;, and recalled that Morrison&#x27;s film was a &quot;much lighter, much friendlier, much funnier kind of thing&quot;.

As the credits point out and as Stone emphasizes in his DVD commentary, some characters, names, and incidents in the film are fictitious or amalgamations of real people. In the 1997 documentary, &quot;The Road of Excess&quot;, Stone states that Quinlan&#x27;s character, Patricia Kennealy, is a composite, and in retrospect should have been given a fictitious name. Kennealy was hurt by her portrayal in the film and objected to a scene where Morrison states that he did not take their handfasting ceremony seriously. Kennealy is credited as a &quot;Wiccan priestess&quot; for her cameo role as the priestess who married the real Jim and Patricia, but the real priestess was a Celtic pagan.

The former Doors said the depiction of Pamela Courson is not accurate at all, as their book &quot;The Doors&quot; describes this version of Courson as &quot;a cartoon of a girlfriend&quot;. Courson&#x27;s parents had inherited Morrison&#x27;s poems when their daughter died, and Stone had to agree to restrictions about his portrayal of her in exchange for the rights to use the poetry. In particular, Stone agreed to avoid any suggestion that Courson may have been responsible for Morrison&#x27;s death. However, Alain Ronay and Courson herself had both said that she was responsible. In &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, Densmore says Courson said she felt terribly guilty because she had obtained drugs that she believed had either caused or contributed to Morrison&#x27;s death.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;The Doors&quot; was entered into the 17th Moscow International Film Festival. In April 2019, a restored version of the film was selected to be shown in the Cannes Classics section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival.

In a contemporary review, Roger Ebert gave &quot;The Doors&quot; two-and-a-half out of four stars. Ebert wrote that he couldn&#x27;t be invested too much to the film&#x27;s story, but praised the acting performances, particularly Kilmer&#x27;s. Contrarily, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote a glowing review, rating it with four out of four stars. In a 2010 piece for &quot;Q&quot; magazine, Keith Cameron stated that &quot;few people emerged from seeing the film having raised their opinions of that band and especially its singer Jim Morrison.&quot; The problem, as critic Cameron put it, was not so much that &quot;Stone dwelled upon Morrison the inebriate, the philanderer, or the pretentious Lizard King&quot;, but rather the &quot;clichéd Hollywood devices for sucking the wonder from the pioneering band: actors with fake hair saying silly things...&quot; and &quot;a self-important director&#x27;s turgid attempts to make grand statements about America.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 56% approval rating based on 61 reviews and an average rating of 5.90/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Val Kilmer delivers a powerhouse performance as one of rock&#x27;s most incendiary figures, but unfortunately, Oliver Stone is unable to shed much light on the circus surrounding the star.&quot; Metacritic reports a 62 out of 100 rating, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

== Home media and &quot;The Final Cut&quot;==
&quot;The Doors&quot; was released on DVD in 1997 and again on August 14, 2001 and was later released on Blu-ray on August 12, 2008. The film was released on 4K Blu-ray on July 23, 2019, with a new version of the film dubbed &quot;The Final Cut&quot;. Supervised by Stone, it features remastered sound and removes a scene where Morrison, following his trial, almost commits suicide. Stone later noted that he had cut 3 minutes for &quot;The Final Cut&quot; as he initially felt the film was too long but shortly after realised he had made a mistake as it left unanswered questions. He has said he prefers the theatrical version and wanted to ensure that version is available on home media.

<text>The Nicobar pigeon or Nicobar dove (Caloenas nicobarica, Car: &quot;&quot;) is a bird found on small islands and in coastal regions from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, east through the Indonesian Archipelago, to the Solomons and Palau. It is the only living member of the genus &quot;Caloenas&quot; alongside the extinct spotted green pigeon and Kanaka pigeon, and is the closest living relative of the extinct dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.

==Taxonomy==
In 1738, the English naturalist Eleazar Albin included a description and two illustrations of the Nicobar pigeon in his &quot;A Natural History of Birds&quot;. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the Nicobar pigeon with all the other pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Columba nicobarica&quot; and cited Albin&#x27;s work. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Caloenas&quot; erected by English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840 with the Nicobar pigeon as the type species.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. n. nicobarica&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Malay Archipelago to New Guinea, Philippines and Solomon Islands
* &quot;C. n. pelewensis&quot; Finsch, 1875 – Palau Island

Based on cladistic analysis of mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and 12S rRNA sequences, the Nicobar pigeon is sometimes called the closest living relative of the extinct didines (Raphinae), which include the famous dodo (&quot;Raphus cucullatus&quot;). However, the study&#x27;s results showed this as one weak possibility from a limited sample of taxa. In any case, nDNA β-fibrinogen intron 7 sequence data agrees with the idea of the Raphinae as a subfamily of pigeons (and not an independent family, as was previously believed due to their bizarre apomorphies) that was part of a diverse Indopacific radiation, to which the Nicobar pigeon also belongs.

The following cladogram, from Shapiro and colleagues (2002), shows the Nicobar pigeon&#x27;s closest relationships within Columbidae, a clade consisting of generally ground-dwelling island endemics.

A similar cladogram was published in 2007, differing only in the inverted placement of &quot;Goura&quot; and &quot;Didunculus&quot;, as well as in the inclusion of the pheasant pigeon and the thick-billed ground pigeon at the base of the clade.

&quot;C. nicobarica&quot; is a quite singular columbiform (though less autapomorphic than the flightless Raphinae), as are for example the tooth-billed pigeon (&quot;Didunculus strigirostris&quot;) and the crowned pigeons (&quot;Goura&quot;), which are typically considered distinct subfamilies. Hence, the Nicobar pigeon may well constitute another now-monotypic subfamily. And while any of the semi-terrestrial pigeons of Southeast Asia and the Wallacea cannot be excluded as possible closest living relative of the Raphinae, the Nicobar pigeon makes a more plausible candidate than for example the group of imperial-pigeons and fruit-doves, which seems to be part of the same radiation.

Whether it is possible to clarify such deep-time phylogenies without a comprehensive study of all major lineages of living Columbidae remains to be seen. The primitive molecular clock used to infer the date the ancestors of the Nicobar pigeon and the didines diverged has since turned out to be both unreliable and miscalibrated. But what little evidence is available still suggests that the Nicobar pigeon is distinct from all other living lifeforms since the Paleogene – most likely some time between 56-34 million years ago during the Eocene, which makes up the bulk of the Paleogene period.

From subfossil bones found on New Caledonia and Tonga, an extinct species of &quot;Caloenas&quot;, the Kanaka pigeon (&quot;C. canacorum&quot;) was described. It was about one-quarter larger than the Nicobar pigeon. Considering that it must have been a good source of food, it was most likely hunted to extinction by the first human settlers of its home islands. It probably was extinct by 500 BC. The Spotted green pigeon (&quot;C. maculata&quot;) is a more recently extinct species from an unknown Pacific locality; it probably disappeared in the 19th century and most likely succumbed to introduced European rats. It is placed in &quot;Caloenas&quot; as the least awkward possibility; its true affinities are presently indeterminate and it is perhaps more likely to represent a distinct genus of the Indopacific radiation of Columbidae.

==Description==

It is a large pigeon, measuring in length. The head is grey, like the upper neck plumage, which turns into green and copper hackles. The tail is very short and pure white. The rest of its plumage is metallic green. The cere of the dark bill forms a small blackish knob; the strong legs and feet are dull red. The irises are dark.

Females are slightly smaller than males; they have a smaller bill knob, shorter hackles and browner underparts. Immature birds have a black tail and lack almost all iridescence. There is hardly any variation across the birds&#x27; wide range. Even the Palau subspecies &quot;C. n. pelewensis&quot; has merely shorter neck hackles, but is otherwise almost identical.

It is a very vocal species, giving a low-pitched repetitive call.

==Distribution and habitat==

On the Nicobar Islands (which are referred to in its common and scientific names), the most significant colony of Nicobar pigeons in modern times was found on Batti Malv, a remote wildlife sanctuary between Car Nicobar and Teressa. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused massive damage on the Nicobar Islands, and to what extent Batti Malv was affected is still not clear. But while everything on some islets in the Great Nicobar Biosphere Reserve was destroyed, Batti Malv lighthouse – a skeletal tower a dozen metres high, standing a few metres ASL at the highest point of the low-lying island – was little-damaged and put back in operation by the survey ship INS &quot;Sandhayak&quot; less than one month after the disaster. An April 2007 survey by the Indian Coast Guard vessel ICGS &quot;Vikram&quot; found the lighthouse tower &quot;totally covered&quot; in vines, indicating rampant regeneration of vegetation – but perhaps also that damage to the island&#x27;s forest was severe, as a cover of creeping plants is typical of early succession stages, while a photo of the lighthouse taken before the tsunami shows rather mature forest.

===Found in Australia===
A Nicobar pigeon was found by the Bardi Jawi Indigenous rangers on the Dampier Peninsula in the western Kimberley region of Australia in May 2017. As part of biosecurity measures, it was reported to quarantine services and was removed by Australian Department of Agriculture officials. In 2023, another individual was found on Green Island, off the coast of Cairns. Green Island Resort&#x27;s environmental manager contacted authorities, but there are currently no plans to relocate the pigeon.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Nicobar pigeon&#x27;s breeding range encompasses the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India, the Mergui Archipelago of Myanmar, offshore islands of south-western Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, southern Cambodia and Vietnam, and many of the small islands between Sumatra, the Philippines and the Solomon Islands. On Palau, the only distinct subspecies &quot;C. n. pelewensis&quot; is found.

The Nicobar pigeon roams in flocks from island to island, usually sleeping on offshore islets where no predators occur and spends the day in areas with better food availability, not shying away from areas inhabited by humans. Its food consists of seeds, fruit and buds, and it is attracted to areas where grain is available. A gizzard stone helps to grind up hard food items. Its flight is quick, with regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings, as is characteristic of pigeons in general. Unlike other pigeons, groups tend to fly in columns or single file, not in a loose flock. The white tail is prominent in flight when seen from behind and may serve as a sort of &quot;taillight&quot;, keeping flocks together when crossing the sea at dawn or dusk. The young birds&#x27; lack of a white tail is a signal of their immaturity clearly visible to conspecifics – to an adult Nicobar pigeon, it is obvious at a glance which flockmembers are neither potential mates, nor potential competitors for mates, nor old enough to safely guide a flock from one island to another.

This species nests in dense forest on offshore islets, often in large colonies. It builds a loose stick nest in a tree. It lays one elliptical faintly blue-tinged white egg.

In 2017, several individual &quot;Caloenas nicobarica&quot; were sighted in the Kimberley region of Western Australia with a juvenile captured at Ardyaloon (One Arm Point), near Broome - the first time the bird has been sighted on the Australian mainland.

==Conservation==

Nicobar pigeons are hunted in considerable numbers for food, and also for their gizzard stone which is used in jewellery. The species is also trapped for the local pet market, but as it is on CITES Appendix I, commercial international trade is prohibited. Internationally, captive breeding is able to supply the birds demanded by zoos, where this attractive and unusual bird is often seen. Direct exploitation of the species, even including the illegal trade, might be sustainable on its own; however, its available nesting habitat is decreasing. The offshore islets which it requires are often logged for plantations, destroyed by construction activity, or polluted by nearby industry or harbours. Also, increased travel introduces predators to more and more of the breeding sites, and colonies of the Nicobar pigeon may be driven to desert such locations or be destroyed outright. Though the bird is widely distributed and in some locations very common --even on small Palau it is still reasonably plentiful, with an estimated 1,000 adult birds remaining—its long-term future is increasingly jeopardized. For these reasons, the IUCN considers &quot;C. nicobarica&quot; a near threatened species.

<text>HMS &quot;Dido&quot; was a Royal Navy (RN) frigate. Entering service in 1961, &quot;Dido&quot; was involved in the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, served with NATO&#x27;s Standing Naval Force Atlantic on several occasions, and was one of the frigates used for the filming of the drama series &quot;Warship&quot;.

Following a defence review at the start of the 1980s, the ship was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN), and was recommissioned as HMNZS &quot;Southland&quot;. &quot;Southland&quot; remained in service until 1995. After decommissioning the frigate was towed to the Philippines where her boilers were removed, and then sent to India for scrapping.

==Construction==
&quot;Dido&quot; was built by Yarrow of Glasgow. She was laid down as a to be called &quot;Hastings&quot; on 2 December 1959, but in 1960, it was decided to complete the ship as one of the new &quot;Leander&quot; class, with the new name &quot;Dido&quot;. The naming ceremony for &quot;Dido&quot; took place on 21 December 1961, but her launch was delayed until the next day because of fog. &quot;Dido&quot; was commissioned on 18 September 1963. Total construction cost was £4,600,000.

The ship was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. While the &quot;Leander&quot;-class was planned to be fitted with the Sea Cat surface-to-air missile, &quot;Dido&quot; was completed with two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns as a temporary substitute until Sea Cat could be fitted. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

As built, &quot;Dido&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar, together with a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS).

==Royal Navy Service==
The ship was assigned to the Far East, joining the 22nd Escort Group in 1964 and took part in the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, and became leader of the 21st Escort Group the following year.

&quot;Dido&quot; was reassigned to the NATO Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) in 1969 and also took part in a fleet review at Spithead on 16 May 1969 as part of the celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the formation of NATO.

The ship was one of four used as the fictional frigate HMS &quot;Hero&quot; in the 1970s BBC television drama series &quot;Warship&quot;.

&quot;Dido&quot; was extensively refitted at Devonport between July 1975 and October 1978, as a Batch 1B Ikara conversion (and the last to be completed), at a cost of £23,000,000. An Ikara ASW missile launcher replaced the 4.5-inch turret, while two Sea Cat launchers were fitted to the hangar roof. The two Bofors guns were retained but moved forward to abreast the ship&#x27;s mainmast. The Limbo anti-submarine mortar and Wasp helicopter was retained. The long-range Type 965 radar was removed, with improved navigation and target indicating radars fitted, and the ADAWS 5 computer aided combat direction system added to direct Ikara operations. The ship&#x27;s sonar suite remained unchanged.

After working up following the refit, &quot;Dido&quot; joined the 3rd Frigate Squadron. In 1983 the ship was briefly assigned again to the Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT).

==Royal New Zealand Navy Service==
As a result of the 1981 Defence Review, which had recommended the disposal of some older frigates, the ship was sold to the RNZN, along with sister ship . The already 18-year-old &quot;Southland&quot; was selected mainly to train RNZN personnel on computerised command and control systems, even though the ADWAS 5 system was dated with only 4 screens and talley and a quarter of the processing capacity and screens of the later Leander and T21, C4 CAAIS. It is seen as a dubious purchase, in retrospect, and by some at the time, as an ageing, if recently refitted, &#x27;over specialised anti submarine frigate&#x27; without any real surface armament or surveillance radar. The acquisition of the second hand frigate was also in direct conflict with the 1978 NZ Defence Review that decided that future frigates would be gas turbine powered and steam abandoned as a prime mover for RNZ combat ships.

Diesel powered long range frigates were also, offered in 1981, HMS Lynx and HMS Lincoln were rejected on account of age and lack of helicopter capability, the partly gas turbine powered HMS Zulu and HMS Norfolk which at least started and could leave port immediately, without 6/8 hours to flash up the steam boilers were rejected on the basis &#x27;that they were already almost in the scrapyard&#x27; (they were later sold to Indonesia and Chile) and excessive manning requirements, although all had 4.5 guns and 965AW radar and in the case of HMS Norfolk, full Link 10/11 USN compatible communications, high range and Exocet missiles. The option of purchasing a second Ikara &quot;Leander&quot; was available in the general offer after the UK 1981 Defence Review, with , and in particular , completed in March 1965, also offered. Given the extremely specialised nature of the Ikara &quot;Leander&quot;s and their incompatibility with the rather different Ikara systems in the Australian Type 12 frigates and guided missile destroyers, the acquisition of two Ikara &quot;Leander&quot;s would actually have given a real capability, able to test and practice, joint computer age anti-submarine operations. As UK experience and UK Treasury costing already indicated that the 13-year-old &quot;Bacchante&quot; was too old for cost-containable structural modernisation, a view also held by the former captain of ,

&quot;Southland&quot; received a five-month, $15 million refit at Vosper Thornycroft after recommissioning on 18 July 1983 as HMNZS &quot;Southland&quot;. During the refit the Limbo mortar and VDS were removed as were the associated 170 and 199 sonars, while US Mk 32 torpedo tubes for anti-submarine torpedoes were fitted. The refit was completed in late December 1983 and over the following months, &quot;Southland&quot; had several workups at Portland and participated in a number of Royal Navy and NATO exercises before sailing for New Zealand in mid-1984. An earlier already had historical links with Southland.

==Decommissioning and fate==
Around 1986 extensive plans were drawn up for a major refit of &quot;Southland&quot; which would have allowed its Ikara capability to remain operational until the mid-1990s. The RN had significantly modernised one of its remaining Ikara &quot;Leander&quot;s, at the time with long range 2031 towed array capable of passive detection in the 160 km + range zone. The Royal Australian Navy planned to continue with its similar, but incompatible, Ikara system for a while. However quotes for refitting &quot;Southland&quot; in UK yards or at Lyttleton proved high, the Cold War effectively ended in 1989 and with the RN and USN withdrawing its stock of nuclear depth charges, (the intended warhead option for RN Ikara &quot;Leander&quot;s to attack Soviet submarines at range, where two directional sound transmission times were probably too great for accurate proximity direction of Ikara carrying MK 46 torpedoes) meant Ikara was no longer useful to the Royal Navy. As a result, the Ikara system was withdrawn from RNZN use in 1989 with space found for a low cost refit at the RNZN dockyard for it to continue as a General Purpose frigate until 1993.

Decommissioned in 1995, &quot;Southland&quot; was towed away by two patrol craft to the Philippines where her boilers were removed for a rubber plantation. She was then towed to Singapore where she was sold to an Indian tug company who took her to Goa beach in India. She was pulled up on the beach and her parts were sold.

<text>Caloenas is a genus of pigeons. The only living species is the Nicobar pigeon (&quot;C. nicobarica&quot;).

One or two extinct species are known: the Kanaka pigeon was a large species from New Caledonia and Tonga. It is only known by subfossil remains and was probably hunted to extinction by the early settlers. The spotted green pigeon, another extinct species from an unknown locality, has only a slight similarity to the Nicobar pigeon due to its neck feathers. Ornithologists place it in this genus, but there is not a unanimous agreement. One surviving specimen exists in the Liverpool Museum.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Caloenas&quot; was introduced by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840 to accommodate the Nicobar pigeon. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;kalos&quot; meaning &quot;beautiful&quot; with &quot;oinas&quot; meaning &quot;dove&quot;.

The genus contains two species:
* Nicobar pigeon (&quot;Caloenas nicobarica&quot;)
* † Spotted green pigeon (&quot;Caloenas maculata&quot;)

Sometimes included in the genus is a species that probably became extinct 2,500 years ago:
* † Kanaka pigeon (&quot;Caloenas canacorum&quot;)

<text>Paul Eugène Pelliot (28 May 187826 October 1945) was a French sinologist and Orientalist best known for his explorations of Central Asia and the Silk Road regions, and for his acquisition of many important Tibetan Empire-era manuscripts and Chinese texts at the Sachu printing center storage caves (Dunhuang), known as the Dunhuang manuscripts.

==Early life and career==
Paul Pelliot was born on 28 May 1878 in Paris, France, and initially intended to pursue a career as a foreign diplomat. Accordingly, he studied English as a secondary school student at La Sorbonne, then studied Mandarin Chinese at the École des Langues Orientales Vivantes (School of Living Oriental Languages). Pelliot was a gifted student, and completed the school&#x27;s three-year Mandarin course in only two years. His rapid progress and accomplishments attracted the attention of the Sinologist Édouard Chavannes, the chair of Chinese at the Collège de France, who befriended Pelliot and began mentoring him. Chavannes also introduced Pelliot to the Collège&#x27;s Sanskrit chair, Sylvain Lévi. Pelliot began studying under the two men, who encouraged him to pursue a scholarly career instead of a diplomatic one.

In early 1900, Pelliot moved to Hanoi to take up a position as a research scholar at the École Française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient (EFEO, &quot;French School of the Far East&quot;). In February of that year, Pelliot was sent to Peking (modern Beijing) to locate and buy Chinese books for the school&#x27;s library. Between July and August 1900, Pelliot was caught up in the siege of the foreign legations during the Boxer Rebellion. At one point, during a ceasefire, Pelliot made a daring one-man foray to the rebels&#x27; headquarters, where he used his boldness and fluency in Mandarin to impress the besiegers into giving him fresh fruit for those inside the legation. For his conduct during the siege, as well as for capturing an enemy flag during the fighting, he was awarded the Légion d&#x27;Honneur upon his return to Hanoi. In 1901, when only 23 years old, Pelliot was made a professor of Chinese at the EFEO.

Pelliot stayed in Hanoi until 1904, when he returned to France in preparation for representing the EFEO at the 1905 International Conference of Orientalists in Algiers. While in France, Pelliot was chosen to direct a government-sponsored archaeological mission to Chinese Turkestan (modern Xinjiang). The group departed in June 1906 and spent several years in the field (see below). By the time the expedition reached Dunhuang, Pelliot had learned Mongolian, Arabic, Persian, the Turkic languages, Tibetan, and Sanskrit, among others, which proved invaluable while examining the many non-Chinese items among the Dunhuang manuscripts inside the Mogao caves.

==Central Asia expedition==

Pelliot&#x27;s expedition left Paris on 17 June 1906. His three-man team included Dr. Louis Vaillant, an Army medical officer, and Charles Nouette, a photographer. Aboard the train in Samarkand, the Frenchmen met Baron Gustaf Mannerheim, a colonel in the Russian Imperial Army and the last Tsarist agent in the Great Game. Pelliot had agreed to allow the army officer, disguised as an ethnographic collector, to travel with his expedition. Mannerheim was actually carrying out a secret mission for Tsar Nicholas II to collect intelligence on the reform and modernization of the Qing Dynasty. The Tsar was assessing the possibility of a Russian invasion of Western China. Pelliot fully endorsed Mannerheim&#x27;s participation, and even offered himself as an informant to the Russian General Staff. In return, the Frenchman demanded free passage on the Trans-Caspian Railway, a personal and confidential payment of ten thousand francs and a Cossack escort. These were granted, and the payment even doubled.
The expedition traveled to Chinese Turkestan by rail through Moscow and Tashkent to Andijan, where they mounted horses and carts to Osh. From here, they travelled across the Alai Mountains of southern Kyrgyzstan over the Taldyk Pass and Irkeshtam Pass to China. Near the town of Gulcha, the expedition met Kurmanjan Datka, the famed Muslim Queen of Alai and posed for a photograph with her. Mannerheim and Pelliot did not get along, and parted ways two days after leaving Irkeshtam Pass. The French team arrived in Kashgar at the end of August, staying with the Russian consul-general (the successor to Nikolai Petrovsky). Pelliot amazed the local Chinese officials with his fluent Chinese (only one of the 13 languages he spoke). His efforts were to pay off shortly, when his team began obtaining supplies (like a yurt) previously considered unobtainable.

His first stop after leaving Kashgar was Tumxuk. From there, he proceeded to Kucha, where he found documents in the lost language of Kuchean. These documents were later translated by Sylvain Lévi, Pelliot&#x27;s former teacher. After Kucha, Pelliot went to Ürümqi, where they encountered Duke Lan, whose brother had been a leader of the Boxer Rebellion. Duke Lan, who was the deputy chief of the Peking gendarmerie and participated in the siege, was in permanent exile in Ürümqi.

In Ürümqi, Pelliot heard about a find of manuscripts at the Silk Road oasis of Dunhuang from Duke Lan. The two had a bittersweet reunion. Pelliot had been in the French legation in Peking while Duke Lan and his soldiers were besieging the foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion. They reminisced about old times and drank champagne. Duke Lan also presented Pelliot with a sample Dunhuang manuscript. Recognizing its antiquity and archaeological value, Pelliot quickly set off for Dunhuang, but arrived there months after the Hungarian-British explorer Aurel Stein had already visited the site.

At Dunhuang, Pelliot managed to gain access to Abbot Wang&#x27;s secret chamber, which contained a massive hoard of medieval manuscripts. Stein had first seen the manuscripts in 1907 and had purchased a large number of them. However, Stein had no knowledge of the Chinese language, and had no way to be selective in which documents he purchased and took back to Britain. Pelliot, on the other hand, had an extensive command of Classical Chinese and numerous other Central Asian languages, and spent three weeks during April 1908 examining manuscripts at breakneck speed. Pelliot selected what he felt were the most valuable of the manuscripts, and Wang, who was interested in continuing the refurbishment of his monastery, agreed to sell them to Pelliot for a price of 500 taels (roughly equivalent to US$11,000 in 2014).

==Return and later years==

Pelliot returned to Paris on 24 October 1909 to a vicious smear campaign mounted against himself and Édouard Chavannes. While at Dunhuang, Pelliot had written a detailed account of some of the most valuable documents he had found and mailed it back to Europe, where it was published upon its arrival. In the report, Pelliot included extensive biographical and textual data and precise dates from many of the manuscripts, which he had examined for only a few minutes each and then later recalled their details from memory while writing his report. That intellectual feat was so astonishing that many who were unfamiliar with Pelliot and his prodigious memory believed he had faked all the manuscripts and written his report from a library full of reference books. Pelliot was publicly accused of wasting public money and returning with forged manuscripts. The campaign came to a head with a December 1910 article in &quot;La Revue Indigène&quot; by Fernand Farjenel (d. 1918) of the Collège libre des sciences sociales. At a banquet on 3 July 1911, Pelliot struck Farjenel, and a court case followed. The charges were not proven false until the Hungarian-British explorer Aurel Stein&#x27;s book, &quot;Ruins of Desert Cathay&quot;, appeared in 1912. In his book, Stein supported Pelliot&#x27;s accounts and made it clear that he had left manuscripts behind in Dunhuang after his visit, which vindicated Pelliot and silenced his critics.

In 1911, as recognition of Pelliot&#x27;s broad and unique scholarship, the Collège de France made him a professor and created a special chair for him: the Chair of the Languages, History, and Archaeology of Central Asia. The chair was never filled after Pelliot&#x27;s death, leaving him the only person to have ever held it. In 1920, Pelliot joined Henri Cordier as co-editor of the preeminent sinological journal &quot;T&#x27;oung Pao&quot;, serving until 1942. After Cordier&#x27;s death in 1924, Pelliot edited &quot;T&#x27;oung Pao&quot; alone until he was joined by Dutch sinologist J. J. L. Duyvendak in 1932.

Pelliot served as French military attaché in Peking during World War I. He died of cancer in 1945. Upon his death, it was said &quot;Without him, sinology is left like an orphan&quot;.

The Guimet Museum in Paris has a gallery named after him.

<text>Franz Ulrich Theodor Aepinus (13 December 172410 August 1802) was a German mathematician, scientist, and natural philosopher residing in the Russian Empire. Aepinus is best known for his researches, theoretical and experimental, in electricity and magnetism.

==Early life==

He was born at Rostock in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was descended from Johannes Aepinus (1499–1553), the first to adopt the Greek form (αἰπεινός) of the family name Hugk or Huck, and a leading theologian and controversialist at the time of the Protestant Reformation.

== Career ==
After studying medicine for a time, Franz Aepinus devoted himself to the physical and mathematical sciences, in which he soon gained such distinction that he was admitted a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In 1755, he was briefly the director of the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut. In 1757, he settled in St Petersburg as member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and professor of physics, and remained there till his retirement in 1798.

The rest of his life was spent at Dorpat. He enjoyed the favor of Empress Catherine II of Russia, who appointed him tutor to her son Paul,
and endeavored, without success, to establish normal schools throughout the empire under his direction. In 1760, Aepinus was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

==Works==

His principal work, &quot;Tentamen Theoriae Electricitatis et Magnetismi&quot; (An Attempt at a Theory of Electricity and Magnetism), published at St. Petersburg in 1759, was the first systematic attempt to apply mathematical reasoning to these subjects. He also published a treatise, in 1761, &quot;De Distributione Caloris per Tellurem&quot; (On the Distribution of Heat in the Earth), and he was the author of memoirs on different subjects in astronomy, mechanics, optics and pure mathematics, contained in the journals of the learned societies of St. Petersburg and Berlin.

His discussion of the effects of parallax in the transit of a planet over the sun&#x27;s disc excited great interest, having appeared (in 1764) between the dates of the two transits of Venus that took place in the 18th century.

==Electrical theories==

Aepinus was the first to show that a theory of action at a distance for electricity provides simple explanation for experimental findings now known as electrostatic induction, laying the foundations for electrostatics His theory resembled Newton&#x27;s approach to gravity in that it relied on unexplained action at a distance; also like Newton Aepinus believed that the transmission of force required contact. These seeming contradictions reflect the modern scientific concept of approximate models of physical phenomena.
Henry Cavendish devised theories of electricity which were essentially the same, yet had been framed without any communication between these two philosophers. Aepinus published his theory about ten years before that of Cavendish. These are theories which eventually put to rest the idea of two fluids.

<doc id="604177" wikidata="Q332242" url="?curid=604177" title="Buraq">
<text>The Buraq ( &quot;lightning&quot;) is a supernatural equine-esque creature in Islamic tradition that served as the mount of the Islamic prophet Muhammad during his Isra and Mi&#x27;raj journey from Mecca to Jerusalem and up through the heavens and back by night. Although never stated to have wings, it is almost always depicted as a pegasus-like being. The Buraq is also said to have transported certain prophets such as Abraham over long distances within a moment&#x27;s duration.

== Etymology ==

The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Islam&quot;, referring to the writings of Al-Damiri (d.1405), considers &quot;al-burāq&quot; to be a derivative and adjective of &quot;barq&quot; &quot;lightning/emitted lightning&quot; or various general meanings stemming from the verb: &quot;to beam, flash, gleam, glimmer, glisten, glitter, radiate, shimmer, shine, sparkle, twinkle&quot;. The name is thought to refer to the creature&#x27;s lightning-like speed. According to &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, &quot;Boraq&quot; is the Arabized form of &quot;Middle Persian *&quot;barāg&quot; or *&quot;bārag&quot;, &#x27;a riding beast, mount&#x27; (New Pers. &quot;bāra&quot;)&quot;. According to Emran El-Badawi, the word can be etymologically associated both with a &quot;riding animal&quot; and the &quot;morning star&quot;.

== Journey to the Seventh Heaven ==
According to Islamic tradition, the Night Journey took place in 621 CE - ten years after Muhammad announced his prophethood. Muhammad had been in Mecca at the home of his cousin, Fakhitah bint Abi Talib, when he went to the Masjid al-Haram. While he was resting at the Kaaba, the Archangel Jibrīl (Gabriel) appeared to him bringing the Buraq, which carried Muhammad, in the archangel&#x27;s company, to &quot;al-masjid al-aqṣá&quot; (&quot;the furthest mosque&quot;) - traditionally held to be at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and identified with the al-Aqsa Mosque.

After reaching Jerusalem, Muhammad descended from the Buraq and prayed on the site of the Temple. He mounted the Buraq again as the creature ascended to the seven heavens, where he successively met Adam, Jesus and his cousin John, Enoch, Aaron, Moses, and Abraham one by one until he reached the throne of God. God communicated with him, giving him words and instructions, and most importantly the commandment to Muslims to offer prayers, initially fifty times a day. At the urging of Moses, Muhammad returned to God several times before eventually reducing the number of prayer-sessions to five.

==Abraham==
According to Ibn Ishaq, the Buraq transported Abraham when he visited Hagar and Ishmael. Tradition states that Abraham lived with Sarah in Canaan but the Buraq would transport him in the morning to Mecca to see his family there and take him back in the evening.

== Hadith ==

Although the Hadith do not explicitly refer to the Buraq as having a human face, Near East and Persian art almost always portrays it so - a portrayal that found its way into Indian, Deccan art. This may have originated from an interpretation of the creature being described with a &quot;beautiful face&quot; as the face being human instead of bestial.

An excerpt from a translation of Sahih al-Bukhari describes Buraq:
Another excerpt describes the Buraq in greater detail:
In the earlier descriptions there is no agreement as to the sex of the Buraq. It is typically male, yet Ibn Sa&#x27;d has Gabriel address the creature as a female, and it was often rendered by painters and sculptors with a woman&#x27;s head. The idea that &quot;al-Buraq&quot; is simply a divine mare is also noted in the book &quot;The Dome of the Rock&quot;, in the chapter &quot;The Open Court&quot;, and in the title-page vignette of Georg Ebers&#x27;s &quot;Palestine in Picture and Word&quot;.

===Western Wall===

Various scholars and writers, such as ibn al-Faqih, ibn Abd Rabbih, and Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi, have suggested places where Buraq was supposedly tethered in stories, mostly locations near the southwest corner of the Haram. However, for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq Mosque, just inside the wall at the south end of the Western Wall Plaza. The mosque sits above an ancient passageway that once came out through the long-sealed Barclay&#x27;s Gate whose huge lintel remains visible below the Maghrebi gate. Because of the proximity to the Western Wall, the area next to the wall has been associated with Buraq at least since the 19th century.

When a British Jew asked the Egyptian authorities in 1840 for permission to re-pave the ground in front of the Western Wall, the governor of Syria wrote:
 Carl Sandreczki, charged with compiling a list of place names for Charles William Wilson&#x27;s Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1865, reported that the street leading to the Western Wall, including the part alongside the wall, belonged to the &quot;Hosh&quot; (court/enclosure) of &quot;al Burâk&quot;, &quot;not &quot;Obrâk&quot;, nor &quot;Obrat&quot;&quot;. In 1866, the Prussian Consul and Orientalist Georg Rosen wrote: &quot;The Arabs call Obrâk the entire length of the wall at the wailing place of the Jews, southwards down to the house of Abu Su&#x27;ud and northwards up to the substructure of the Mechkemeh [Shariah court]. Obrâk is not, as was formerly claimed, a corruption of the word Ibri (Hebrews), but simply the neo-Arabic pronunciation of Bōrâk, ... which, whilst (Muhammad) was at prayer at the holy rock, is said to have been tethered by him inside the wall location mentioned above.&quot;

The name Hosh al Buraq appeared on the maps of Wilson&#x27;s 1865 survey, its revised editions in 1876 and 1900, and other maps in the early 20th century. In 1922, the official Pro-Jerusalem Council specified it as a street name.

The association of the Western Wall area with Buraq has played an important role in disputes over the holy places since the British mandate.

For Muslims, the Wailing Wall (or Western Wall) is known as &quot;Ḥā’iṭu ’l-Burāq&quot; () - &quot;the Buraq Wall&quot;, for on the other side (the Muslim side of the Wailing Wall on the Temple Mount) is where it is believed Muhammad tied the Buraq, the riding animal upon which he rode during the Night of Ascension (Arabic: &quot;Mi‘rāj&quot;). The wall links to the structure of the Al-Buraq Mosque.

== Cultural impact ==

* In Turkey, Pakistan and other Muslim countries, Burak is a common male name.
* Al-Boraq (Arabic: البُراق) is a 323-kilometre-long (201 mi) high-speed rail service between Casablanca and Tangier operated by ONCF in Morocco. The first of its kind on the African continent, and the fastest.
* Two airlines have been named after Buraq: Buraq Air of Libya and the defunct Bouraq Indonesia Airlines of Indonesia, which ceased operations in 2006.
* &quot;El-Borak&quot; is a pirate in Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot;; &quot;El Borak&quot; is a character in short stories by Robert E. Howard. Both are named for their speed and reflexes.
* The Iranian Boragh armoured personnel carrier is named after it.
* Pakistan&#x27;s NESCOM Burraq was named after the Buraq.
* A Bangladeshi Transport company is named Boraq Paribahan (বোরাক পরিবহন).
* A Malaysian petrol company is named Buraq Oil.
* Aceh, Indonesia has adopted the image of a Buraq on the rampant in the proposed Aceh official seal.

<doc id="604179" wikidata="Q682447" url="?curid=604179" title="Testament of Adam">
<text>The Testament of Adam is a Christian work of Old Testament pseudepigrapha that dates from the 2nd to 5th centuries AD in origin, perhaps composed within the Christian communities of Syria. It purports to relate the final words of Adam to his son Seth; Seth records the Testament and then buries the account in the legendary Cave of Treasures. Adam speaks of prayer and which parts of Creation praise God each hour of the day; he then prophesies both the coming of the Messiah and the Great Flood; and finally, a description of the celestial hierarchy of angels is given.

The work was likely originally written in Syriac. Manuscripts are extant in Syriac, Arabic, Karshuni, Ethiopic, Armenian, Georgian, and Greek. The earliest surviving manuscript is dated to the 9th century, and there appear to be three major recensions of the text.

==Authorship and date==
The author of the work is unknown. The date of composition was likely somewhere between the 2nd century to the 5th century; S. E. Robinson hypothesizes that the mid-to-late third century as the best guess. They probably were a Syrian or Palestinian Christian, as certain wordplay and puns seem unique to Syriac in the oldest versions, along with a quote of Zechariah 1:8 that matches the Syriac Peshitta version rather than the Greek Septuagint version. There appears to be a quotation of the work in the Syriac version of the &quot;Transitus Mariae&quot;, generally thought to date to the late 4th century. The third section of the work, the celestial hierarchy, does not appear closely linked to the rest of the work; it is thus possible it was composed independently before being combined with the work at some point in the 5th–7th centuries.

The author was likely compiling and modifying an existing piece of Jewish apocrypha. What was originally a Jewish midrash on the story of Creation was expanded to include a defense of Christianity&#x27;s claim that Jesus was the promised Jewish Messiah. This suggests a community that was admiring of Judaism, as contrasted to other branches of Christianity which strongly rejected Judaism in the era of the late Roman Empire; for this author, Jesus was a continuation of a grand Jewish tradition.

==Content==
The text is pseudepigraphically attributed to Adam&#x27;s son Seth, who wrote the Testament then sealed it in the Cave of Treasures. The first section, called the Horarium by S. E. Robinson, consists of describing which creatures praise God at each hour, and how they do so. It is notably a unitary view of God&#x27;s dominion over creation rather than a dualist one: all, from demons to the fire to grass to humans to angels, serve God.

In the second section, called the Prophecy by Robinson, Adam reveals hidden information to Seth. He tells of the creation and fall of man, speaks of the coming Great Flood, prophecies of the Passion of Jesus Christ, and the final end of the world. God also promises to make Adam a god, but &quot;not right now&quot;; the delay is due to Adam&#x27;s sin in eating the forbidden fruit, identified here as a fig. God says he will deify Adam after God&#x27;s (Jesus&#x27;s) resurrection, and Adam will sit at the right hand of God.

The third section, called the Hierarchy by Robinson, includes a detailed angelology that describes all nine orders of angels and their functions. In order from lowest to highest, angels act as guardian angels, with one for each human. Archangels care for non-humans such as animals and birds. Archons control the weather. Authorities govern the sources of light in the sky above: the Sun, the Moon, and the stars. Powers stop demons from destroying the world in their jealousy of humanity. Dominions rule over political kingdoms and control victory and defeat in battle. The text describes one as riding a red horse and killing thousands under the Assyrian king, along with a reference to the 2 Maccabees version of the Battle of Beth Zur where an angel armed with a golden weapon helped send the Seleucid army to flight. Thrones guard the gate of the holy of holies and stand before the throne of God. Cherubim carry the throne of the Lord and are keepers of the divine seals. Seraphim serve in the inner chamber.

==Similar works==
The first section of the story is similar to Psalm 148, another account of how all creation praises God. Similar apocryphal works include the Gnostic Apocalypse of Adam, the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, and the Life of Adam and Eve. The work (along with the Syriac version of Cave of Treasures) seems to have influenced the Arabic Apocalypse of Peter, another pseudepigraphical text popular in Syrian Christianity dated to the 9th–10th centuries. The angelology of the third section may have influenced the Book of the Bee, a 13th-century Syriac work.

<doc id="604184" wikidata="Q772197" url="?curid=604184" title="Population Registration Act, 1950">
<text>The Population Registration Act of 1950 required that each inhabitant of South Africa be classified and registered in accordance with their racial characteristics as part of the system of apartheid.
Social rights, political rights, educational opportunities, and economic status were largely determined by the group to which an individual belonged. There were three basic racial classifications under the law: Black, White and Coloured (mixed). Indians (that is, South Asians from the former British India, and their descendants) were later added as a separate classification as they were seen as having &quot;no historical right to the country&quot;.

An &quot;Office for Race Classification&quot; was set up to overview the classification process. Classification into groups was carried out using criteria such as outer appearance, general acceptance and social standing. For example, it defined a &quot;white person&quot; as one who &quot;in appearance is obviously a white person who is generally not accepted as a coloured person, or is generally accepted as a white person and is not in appearance obviously a white person.&quot; Because some aspects of the profile were of a social nature, reclassification was not uncommon, and a board was established to conduct that process. The following criteria were used for separating the coloured people from the white people:

* Characteristics of the person&#x27;s head hair
* Characteristics of the person&#x27;s other hair
* Skin colour
* Facial features
* Home language and especially the knowledge of Afrikaans
* Area where the person lives, the person&#x27;s friends and acquaintances
* Employment
* Socioeconomic status
* Eating and drinking habits

This law worked in tandem with other laws passed as part of the apartheid system. Under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act of 1949, it was illegal for a white person to marry a person of another race. With the enactment of the Immorality Amendment Act of 1950, it also became a crime for a white person and a person of another race to have sexual intercourse.

Under the act, as amended, Coloureds and Indians were formally classified into various subgroups, including Cape Coloured, Malay, Griqua, Chinese, Indian, &quot;Other Asian&quot; and &quot;Other Coloured&quot;.

The South African Parliament repealed the act on 17 June 1991. However, the racial categories defined in the act remain ingrained in South African culture and they still form the basis of some official policies and statistics aimed at redressing past economic imbalances (Black Economic Empowerment and Employment Equity).

<text>The Flemish Community Commission () is the local representative of the Flemish authorities in the Brussels-Capital Region, one of the three regions of Belgium. The VGC depends on the Flemish Parliament, and its council is made up by the members of the Dutch linguistic group of the Brussels Parliament, whereas its executive is made up of the two Flemish ministers and the Flemish secretary of the Brussels-Capital Government.

The VGC was established by the special (constitutional) law of 12 January 1989.

The VGC has competencies for cultural, educational, well-being and health for Flemings in Brussels. It reaches an estimated 200,000 inhabitants of Brussels with its services, mostly Dutch-speakers, and a significant number of migrants. However, several of these competencies are rather limited in practice, e.g. it has not the slightest authority for hospitals.

Strictly legally speaking, the VGC is only competent for institutions depending on the Flemish government, and not for individual citizens. This was a consequence of the fact that no formal Flemish citizenship was established.
The VGC is the successor of the &quot;Nederlandse Commissie voor de Cultuur van de Brusselse agglomeratie (NCC)&quot; (in Dutch), established in 1971. The VGC also assumed all Flemish community-specific responsibilities in Brussels of the former province of Brabant when it was split up.

It does not have legislative power contrary to the other two community commissions. The French equivalent may adopt decrees and the Common Community Commission may adopt ordinances, which both have force of law.

<text>Walther Penck (30 August 1888 – 29 September 1923) was a geologist and geomorphologist known for his theories on landscape evolution. Penck is noted for criticizing key elements of the Davisian cycle of erosion, concluding that the process of uplift and denudation occur simultaneously, at gradual and continuous rates. Penck&#x27;s idea of parallel slope retreat led to revisions of Davis&#x27;s cycle of erosion.

==Biography==

Walther Penck was born in Vienna as the son of German geographer Albrecht Penck. He obtained a PhD by studying petrology at the Heidelberg University. Between 1912 and 1915 he worked in Dirección General de Minas in Buenos Aires before moving to the University of Constantinople where he was named professor of mineralogy and geology. He finally settled as professor in the University of Leipzig in 1918. The areas he studied in detail and based his theories on include the Black Forest in Germany, Puna de Atacama in Argentina and Anatolia in modern Turkey.

During the 1920s Penck, with Siegfried Passarge, Alfred Hettner and his father, was the foremost figure in a broad German opposition to the &quot;geographical cycle&quot; theory of William Morris Davis. It was characteristic of Davis to react violently and disdainfully to criticism, particularly to this German criticism; it was also his characteristic to choose to attack the most vulnerable points of that criticism. Regarding Walther Penck&#x27;s objections to the Davisian geographic cycle Davis commented to Albrecht Penck in 1921:

It is pleasant news that your son, Walther, is established as professor in Leipzig where his father long ago studied. As he may have told you, I have enjoyed reading parts of his Argentine monograph, an able piece of work, and I have written asking him to specify the difficulties he finds in accepting the cycle theory. I am inclined to believe that he really does not know what that theory is...

Walther Penck died of oral cancer in September 1923. His book, &quot;Morphological Analysis of Landforms&quot;, was published posthumously in 1924 by his father as was also his paper (The piedmont-flats of the southern Black Forest).

==Geomorphological theory==

===Concepts===
In his analysis Penck utilized the following concepts:
#: A low-angle landscape with concave slopes. It is the final stage of erosion that follows after inselbergs and pediments are eroded.
#: A series of folds and synclines analogous to orogenic folding. It is usual type of folds created by lateral compression in the crust. As the develops it narrows at the same time they become higher. Can be translated as &#x27;great fold&#x27; in English. Davis translated it into &#x27;broad fold&#x27;. Penck himself was unhappy with the term . 
#: Can be translated into English as &#x27;piedmont flat&#x27;, &#x27;piedmont bench&#x27; or &#x27;piedmont step&#x27;.
#Piedmonttreppen: descending erosional benches on an uplifted area. Their shape is more or less concentric. Penck interpreted the as the result of doming. Benches he thought originated as in the periphery of the dome before they were uplifted. It can be translated into English as &#x27;piedmont benchland&#x27;, &#x27;piedmont stairway&#x27; or &#x27;piedmont treppe&#x27;.
#: A more or less plain and subtly convex slope. The form is given by the very slow waxing of erosion. Erosion cycles should begin from a . Can be formed at the base of a dome.

===Landform and landscape evolution according to uplift rate===
Walther Penck thought landform development depended on uplift rate. He saw three main types of landform and landscape development all of which begun with or and ended with . The differences between them depended on their rate of uplift: peneplains developed in places with a low rate of uplift, intermediate forms developed in places of moderate uplift, and Alpine forms developed on places of rapid uplift. In Penck&#x27;s valley development model the steepness of valley slopes depended on the rate of uplift; this view contrasts with the Davis&#x27;s erosion cycle, in which valley slope steepness depends on its relative age or stage of development.

===Landform associations===

Penck thought earths surface could be divided into three types of regions each with an own landform association. First there were regions of and general doming, then there were regions of pure doming, and at last there were regions of stability.

==Criticism and legacy==
William Morris Davis, a friend of Penck&#x27;s father, criticized the theories Walther Penck outlined in . Geographer Martin Simons claimed in 1962 that Davis misunderstood and mis-translated parts of the paper leaving a distorted view of Penck&#x27;s ideas among later workers. Simons therefore does not consider Davis an adequate critic of Penck&#x27;s work. Other factors detrimental to an understanding of Penck&#x27;s ideas include his early death and his confusing writing style. Albrecht Penck did is not known to have publicly taken any stance for or against his son&#x27;s theory. Douglas Wilson Johnson, a coastal geomorphologist and staunch supporter of Davis, criticized Penck&#x27;s theory harshly as:
:&quot;Penck’s conception that slope profiles are convex, plane, or concave according to the circumstances of the uplifting action, [as] one of the most fantastic errors ever introduced into geomorphology&quot;

Penck&#x27;s theories had a much more limited influence in Germany compared to the English-speaking world where they gained notoriety for their contrasts to Davis&#x27;. As of 1983 it was noted that albeit Penck&#x27;s theories were ignored in the discussion of the geomorphology of Central European massifs, the theories were often discussed in English-language Geomorphological textbooks.

Julius Büdel, a German geomorphologist working in the same areas as Penck in Southern Germany, provided alternative explanations in 1935 for some of the landforms Penck had dealt with.

Geographer Allaoua Saadi remarks by 2013 that Penck&#x27;s and Davis&#x27; ideas have become more compatible and even complementary since the advent of modern tectonic theory. This author claims that Davis&#x27; ideas are more applicable near active margins where tectonics are &quot;cataclysmic&quot; and Penck&#x27;s ideas fit better in passive margins and continental platforms.

Walther Penck has a volcano named after him in northwestern Argentina.

<text>Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB) is one of the five major ballet companies of the United Kingdom, alongside The Royal Ballet, the English National Ballet, Northern Ballet and Scottish Ballet. Founded as the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Ballet, the company was established in 1946 as a sister company to the earlier Sadler&#x27;s Wells company, which moved to the Royal Opera House that same year, subsequently becoming known as The Royal Ballet.

The new company was formed under the direction of John Field and remained at Sadler&#x27;s Wells for many years, becoming known as the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Royal Ballet in 1977. It also toured the UK and abroad, before relocating to Birmingham in 1990, where it uses the Birmingham Hippodrome stage when performing in the city. Birmingham Royal Ballet has extensive custom-built facilities, including a suite of dance studios, the &quot;Jerwood Centre for the Prevention and Treatment of Dance Injuries&quot; and a studio theatre known as the &quot;Patrick Centre&quot;. In 1997, the Birmingham Royal Ballet became independent of The Royal Ballet in London.

==History==
In 1926, the Irish-born dancer Ninette de Valois founded the &quot;Academy of Choreographic Art&quot;, a dance school for girls. Her intention was to form a repertory ballet company and school, leading her to collaborate with the English theatrical producer and theatre owner Lilian Baylis. Baylis owned the Old Vic and Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatres, and in 1925, she engaged de Valois to stage dance performances at both venues.

Sadler&#x27;s Wells reopened in 1931, and the &quot;Vic-Wells Ballet&quot; and &quot;Vic-Wells Ballet School&quot; were established in premises at the theatre. These would become the predecessors of today&#x27;s &quot;Royal Ballet&quot;, &quot;Birmingham Royal Ballet&quot; and &quot;Royal Ballet School&quot;.

In 1939, the company lost its link with the Old Vic theatre, and in 1940, Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre was bombed during World War II. These events forced the company to begin touring the country, becoming known as the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Ballet. The company did return to Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre, where it stayed until 1946, when the company was invited to become the resident ballet company of the newly re-opened Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. The company relocated to the opera house the same year in 1946, with their first production at the venue being Ninette de Valois&#x27; staging of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;.
Following the relocation of the company, the school was relocated to its own premises in 1947, and a sister company was established to continue performances at Sadler&#x27;s Wells, called &quot;Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Ballet&quot;. This sister company would become the predecessor of today&#x27;s Birmingham Royal Ballet. The first Artistic Director of the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Ballet was John Field, who was later made co-director of the Royal Ballet and also worked as artistic director of La Scala Theatre Ballet and English National Ballet.

In 1955, &quot;Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre Ballet&quot; temporarily lost its link with Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre and relocated to the Royal Opera House as a touring unit of the main company.

In 1956, a royal charter was granted for both companies and the school, and they were subsequently renamed the &quot;Royal Ballet&quot;, &quot;Sadler&#x27;s Wells Royal Ballet&quot; and the &quot;Royal Ballet School&quot;.

The &quot;Sadler&#x27;s Wells Royal Ballet&quot; returned to Sadler&#x27;s Wells theatre in 1970, whilst continuing to tour the country. The first indication that the company would leave London came in 1987, when the company was invited to become the resident ballet company at the Birmingham Hippodrome theatre. Consequently, the company relocated to Birmingham in 1990, being given its current name &quot;Birmingham Royal Ballet&quot;.

Sir Peter Wright was the company&#x27;s Artistic Director from 1977 until his retirement in 1995, when David Bintley was appointed Artistic Director. In 1997, Birmingham Royal Ballet was made independent of the Royal Ballet and ceased to be managed by the Royal Opera House. In January 2019 it was announced that acclaimed Cuban dancer Carlos Acosta would succeed Bintley as artistic director in January 2020.

<text>The Catholic University of America (CUA) is a private Catholic research university in Washington, D.C., United States. It is one of two pontifical universities of the Catholic Church in the United States - the only one that is not primarily a seminary - and the only institution of higher education founded by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Established in 1887 as a graduate and research center following approval by Pope Leo XIII, the university began offering undergraduate education in 1904. In the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, it is classified as &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;.

Its campus is adjacent to the Brookland neighborhood, known as &quot;Little Rome,&quot; which contains 60 Catholic institutions, including Trinity Washington University, the Dominican House of Studies, Archbishop Carroll High School, and the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.

CUA&#x27;s programs emphasize the liberal arts, professional education, and personal development. The school stays closely connected with the Catholic Church and Catholic organizations. The residential U.S. cardinals put on the American Cardinals Dinner each year to raise scholarship funds. The university also has a long history of working with the Knights of Columbus; its law school has dedications to the involvement and support of the Knights.

==History==
===Founding===

At the Second Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1866, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops first discussed the need for a national Catholic university. At the Third Plenary Council on January 26, 1885, bishops chose the name &quot;The Catholic University of America&quot; for the institution.

In 1882, Bishop John Lancaster Spalding went to Rome to obtain Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s support for the university, also persuading his family friend Mary Gwendoline Caldwell to pledge $300,000 to establish it. On April 10, 1887, Pope Leo XIII sent James Cardinal Gibbons a letter granting permission to establish the university. On March 7, 1889, the Pope issued the encyclical &quot;Magni Nobis&quot;, granting the university its charter and establishing its mission as the instruction of Catholicism and human nature together at the graduate level. By developing new leaders and new knowledge, the university was intended to strengthen and enrich Catholicism in the United States.

The university was incorporated in 1887 on of land next to the Old Soldiers Home. President Grover Cleveland was in attendance for the laying of the cornerstone of Divinity Hall, now known as Caldwell Hall, on May 24, 1888, as were members of Congress and the U.S. Cabinet.

When the university first opened on November 13, 1889, the curriculum consisted of lectures in mental and moral philosophy, English literature, the sacred scriptures, and the various branches of theology. At the end of the second term, lectures on canon law were added. The first students were graduated in 1889. By 1900, CUA was one of the 14 colleges that offered doctorate programs which formed the Association of American Universities.

===20th century===
In 1904, the university added an undergraduate program. The president of the first undergraduate class was Frank Kuntz, whose memoir of that period was published by The Catholic University of America Press. The university gives an annual award named for Kuntz.

Bishop and Rector Thomas J. Shahan gave a speech to the Ancient Order of Hibernians in 1894 in which he advocated for Irish independence in language, culture, and politics. This resulted in the Hibernians endowing a chair of Gaelic Languages and Literature at the university. Only Harvard University had a similar position at the time, and this attracted the attention of William Butler Yeats. During a trip to the United States, Yeats spoke to students in McMahon Hall on February 21, 1904. In a follow-up letter to Shahan, he said: &quot;you have surely a great university and I wish we had its like in Ireland.&quot;

Despite Washington, D.C., being a Southern and segregated city when the university was founded, it admitted black Catholic men as students. At the time, the only other college in the District to do so was Howard University, founded for African-American education after the Civil War. In 1895, Catholic University had three black students, all from DC. &quot;They were simply tested as to their previous education, and this being found satisfactory, no notice whatever was taken of their color. They stand on exactly the same footing as other students of equal intellectual calibre and acquirements&quot;, according to Keane. Conaty, speaking to President William McKinley during a visit on June 1, 1900, said that the university, &quot;like the Catholic Church ... knows no race line and no color line.&quot; The policy was reversed in 1914, with CUA kowtowing to segregationist policies and commencing denial of admissions to Black students.

In 1935, the university&#x27;s coat of arms was designed by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose.

A victory parade for the 1936 Orange Bowl champions went up Pennsylvania Avenue on its circular route from Union Station to campus. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, &quot;on his way to church, became an unwitting parader, when the march de triumph jammed traffic in front of the White House.&quot;

In 1938, due to the rise of the antisemitic priest Charles Coughlin and not long after Kristallnacht, CUA officials asked CBS and NBC to broadcast an event live from the university campus. The broadcast had little effect, participating clerics did not mention Coughlin, and barely mentioned Nazi conduct by name, while offering general support for Jews.

The university began admitting Black students again in 1936, following protests from Thomas Wyatt Turner, the Federated Colored Catholics and NAACP (both of which Turner co-founded), and the Catholic Interracial Council. Forty Black students were enrolled by 1939 with most in the School of Arts and Sciences. However, Black students continued to experience discrimination at the university with segregation practiced in many parts of the campus until the mid-1940s.

The presence of CUA attracted other Catholic institutions to the area, including colleges, religious orders, and national service organizations. Between 1900 and 1940, more than 50 international Catholic institutions rented or owned property in neighboring Brookland. Following World War II, Catholic University had a dramatic expansion in enrollment, thanks to veterans making use of the G.I. Bill to complete college educations.

===Law school===
In 1954, Columbus University merged with the law program of CUA to become the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University of America, after the American Bar Association in 1951 challenged law schools not affiliated with a university. The CUA law school was the first professional school of the university.

===21st century===

By the early 21st century, the university has over 6,000 students from all 50 states and around the world. In 2018, the university experienced some challenges as administrators worked to reduce a $3.5 million deficit. Some faculty objected to the draft plan and voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in the president and provost.

On September 22, 2021, it was announced that John Garvey would be stepping down as President of Catholic University on June 30, 2022.

==Knights of Columbus==
The Knights of Columbus and Catholic University of America have a history of &quot;a close and supportive relationship&quot; that dates almost to the founding of the university.

In 1899, the National Council of the K of C established a Knights of Columbus Chair of American History at the university. More than 10,000 Knights were on hand on April 13, 1904, to present a $55,633.79 check ($1,399,831.80 in 2012 dollars) to endow the chair.

In December 1904, Cardinal Gibbons appealed to the Knights for more financial aid to help meet operating costs after some investments went sour. The Order gave nearly $25,000. By 1907 the financial situation of Catholic University had improved but was still shaky. Every Knight was asked to contribute $1 a year for a five-year period, and in December 1913, a $500,000 endowment was established.

In 1920, the order contributed $60,000 toward the Catholic University gymnasium and drill hall, which later was adapted for use as the Crough Building housing the School of Architecture. In 2006, the Knights announced an $8,000,000 gift to the university to renovate Keane Hall and rename it as McGivney Hall, after the Knights&#x27; founder, Michael J. McGivney. The building, which was vacant, now houses the Washington session of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family, which was funded by the Knights and established at the Dominican House of Studies adjacent to the CUA campus in 1988.

In August 1965, a $1 million was established to fund the Pro Deo and Pro Patria Scholarship, providing twelve undergraduate scholarships annually to the university. In 1989 the Knights voted a $2,000,000 birthday gift to the U.S. bishops on their bicentennial, to be given to Catholic University and used to fund special projects jointly chosen by the university and the Knights. Part of it was used to build the Columbus School of Law.

==Papal visits==
CUA is the only American university to have been visited by three popes and is one of only two universities to have any visits by a pontiff. Pope John Paul II visited on October 7, 1979. On April 16, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI gave an address at the campus about Catholic education and academic freedom. Pope Francis visited on September 23, 2015, during his trip to the United States, where he celebrated Mass on the east portico of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.

==Campus==


CUA&#x27;s campus is in the residential community of Brookland in Northeast Washington; its main entrance is 620 Michigan Ave., NE. The campus is bound by Michigan Avenue to the south, North Capitol Street to the west, Hawaii Avenue to the north, and John McCormick Road to the east. It is three miles (5 km) north of the Capitol building.

The tree-lined campus is . Romanesque and modern design dominate among the university&#x27;s 48 major buildings. Between McMahon and Gibbons halls and alongside the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception runs The Mall, a large strip of grass often used by Ultimate Frisbee players and sunbathers. Conte Circle is in the middle of Centennial Village, a cluster of eight residential houses.

The Edward J. Pryzbyla University Center opened in the spring of 2003, bringing student dining services, the campus bookstore, student organization offices, an 800-person ballroom, a convenience store, and more student services under one roof. The John K. Mullen Library completed a $6,000,000 renovation in 2004.

Columbus School of Law is on the main campus and has a building with mock courtrooms, a library, chapel, classrooms, and offices.

Theological College, the United States&#x27; national Catholic seminary, is affiliated with CUA, sending students there for their studies. Also located near campus is the St. John Paul II Seminary, a minor seminary for the Archdiocese of Washington but also serving nearby dioceses and hosting seminarians from dioceses around the country. Students from the minor seminary study for their undergraduate philosophy degrees at the university. Several organizations of religious life also have seminaries nearby—including the Josephites, Carmelites, Franciscans, Oblates of Mary Immaculate, and Paulist Fathers, each of which send students to CUA.

In April 2004, CUA purchased of land from the Armed Forces Retirement Home. It is the largest plot of open space in the District and makes CUA the largest university in D.C. by area. There are no plans for the parcel other than to secure it for future growth.

In 2007, CUA unveiled plans to expand its campus by adding three new dormitories to the north side of campus. The first of these, the seven-story Opus Hall, was completed in 2009 in the university&#x27;s traditional Collegiate Gothic style. It houses 420 upper-class students and is Washington&#x27;s first LEED-certified dormitory. Opus Hall is the first residential community to house both male and female students since the 2007 adoption of a single-sex dormitory policy.

In 2022, Welcome Plaza, located between Fr. O’Connell and Gibbons halls, was built to house the 4 ton sculpture &quot;Angels Unawares&quot; by Canadian artist Timothy Schmalz. A fountain was installed below the sculpture, creating an illusion that the boat is sailing forward within Welcome Plaza.

CUA demolished Conaty and Spellman dormitories, which allowed for the development of Monroe Street by Bozzuto contracting. In partnership with the university, Monroe Street Market and the Brookland Arts Walk opened in 2014. A CUA Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore opened on Monroe. New apartments in the development allow older students the opportunity to reside off campus within walking distance of the university.

The campus is served by the Brookland-CUA station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro. Near the campus are the offices of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America.

===Green initiatives and sustainability===
CUA has environmental sustainability programs, including participation in Earth Day, Casey Trees tree planting, and Campus Beautification Day. CUA&#x27;s newest building, Opus Hall, is LEED-compliant, and the school buys 30% of its electricity from green sources. CUA participated in the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card rating.

In 2009, the School of Architecture and Planning introduced a Master of Science program in sustainable design.

==Satellite campuses==
===Rome===

In 2015, CUA began a partnership with the Australian Catholic University to effectively own and operate a second campus in Rome, Italy. It is housed in a former convent and includes a chapel. Before being sent home during the COVID-19 pandemic, 35 students were at the campus.

===Tucson===
By 2015, Catholic University officials had recognized that most Hispanics in the United States are Catholics but historically have not had access to Catholic higher education in their areas. According to a university press release, an analysis by Catholic University found that of &quot;the 25 U.S. cities with the largest total increases in the Hispanic population, nine have no Catholic college or university in close proximity.&quot;

Given this demographic reality, in 2017 Catholic University began exploring partnerships with existing institutions in the Southwest. Several cities with large populations of Hispanics and Catholics were considered when then-Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild heard of Catholic University&#x27;s desire to open a satellite campus and facilitated meetings between University leadership and then-Bishop of Tucson Gerald Kicanas.

In 2019, a partnership with Pima Community College was announced under which students could earn an associate degree from Pima and a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business management from Catholic University&#x27;s Metropolitan School of Professional Studies. Between 20 and 25 students were initially be admitted to the program, with 14 eventually enrolling for their studies at Catholic University Tucson.

Over the course of the program, two-thirds of courses are taken remotely and one-third are taken on the Pima campus. Local business leaders as well as faculty and staff at the Catholic University of America main campus in Washington, DC serve as adjunct professors.

The first class of four students graduated in 2024, and the program has grown from 14 to 65 students, with the further goal to double their enrollment by fall 2026.

===Alexandria===
In 2021, a new site in Alexandria, Virginia, occupying on the second floor of Catholic Charities USA&#x27;s headquarters building, was opened to offer a number of noncredit certificate programs. On May 31, 2024, the University closed the Alexandria facility due to lack of demand for the programs offered there.

==Academics==

Catholic University has 12 schools:
*School of Architecture and Planning
*School of Arts and Sciences
*Tim and Steph Busch School of Business
*School of Canon Law
*School of Engineering
*Columbus School of Law
*Benjamin T. Rome School of Music, Drama, and Art
*Conway School of Nursing

*School of Theology and Religious Studies
It also has 21 research centers and facilities as well as serving as home to the Catholic University of America Press, established in 1939. The 12 schools offer Doctor of Philosophy degrees (or appropriate professional degrees) in 66 programs and Master&#x27;s Degrees in 103 programs. Undergraduate degrees are awarded in 72 programs by six schools: architecture and planning, arts and sciences, engineering, music, nursing, and philosophy.

Undergraduates combine a liberal arts curriculum in arts and sciences with courses in a major field of study. The Metropolitan School provides programs for adults who wish to earn baccalaureate degrees or participate in continuing education and certificate programs on a part-time basis. Catholic University is the only U.S. university with an ecclesiastical faculty of canon law (established by the Holy See in 1923) and is one of the few U.S. universities with ecclesiastical faculties of philosophy and sacred theology. Theological College, the university seminary, prepares men for the priesthood. The School of Theology and Religious Studies is a member of the Washington Theological Consortium.

The Catholic University of America announced on January 8, 2013, the creation of a School of Business and Economics. Previously housed in the School of Arts and Sciences as &quot;Department of Business and Economics&quot;, the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted in December 2012 to confirm the creation of the school commencing January 1, 2013, after a three-year process of discernment, evaluation, and planning. In fall 2013, the School of Library and Information Science became a department of the School of Arts and Sciences, giving the university its present composition.

Ninety-eight percent of full-time faculty have doctoral or terminal degrees and 68% teach undergraduates. Of the full-time faculty, 59% are Catholic. In 2018, every tenured and tenure track professor of biology received funding from the National Institutes of Health, which is &quot;quite rare in any university&quot;.

CUA was one of the fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities, although it withdrew its membership in 2002, citing a conflict with its mission. In addition, it has been recommended by the Cardinal Newman Society in &quot;The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College&quot;. It was described as one of the 25 most underrated colleges in the United States.

===Research centers and facilities===

According to the National Science Foundation, CUA spent $25.5 million on research and development in 2018.

Over time, several national Catholic scholarly associations became based at the university, including the Catholic Biblical Association of America, publisher of the &quot;Catholic Biblical Quarterly&quot;, and (for many years) the American Catholic Philosophical Association. The university is also home to the Catholic University of America Press.

Research institutes located here include:
*Center for Advanced Training in Cell and Molecular Biology
*Center for Advancement of Catholic Education
*Center for American Catholic Studies
*Center for Catalan Studies
*Center for Irish Studies
*Center for Medieval and Byzantine Studies
*Center for Pastoral Studies
*Center for the Study of Culture and Values
*Center for the Study of Early Christianity
*Center for the Study of Energy and Environmental Stewardship
*Center for Ward Method Studies
*Homecare and Telerehabilitation Technology Center
*Institute for Astrophysics and Computational Sciences
*Institute for Biomolecular Studies
*Institute for Christian Oriental Research
*Institute for Communications Law Studies
*Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies (formerly the Life Cycle Institute)
*Institute for Sacred Music
*Institute for Social Justice
*Institute of Musical Arts

*Vitreous State Laboratory

===Libraries===
The main library on campus is the John K. Mullen of Denver Memorial Library. The library system houses more than 1.3 million books and print volumes and provides access to tens of thousands of electronic journals and books. The University is also a partner in the Washington Research Library Consortium. The special collections of the university support advanced research and preserve University records, manuscript collections, and audiovisual materials which document the history of Catholics in America and the history of Catholic University. Rare books collections contain materials ranging from medieval manuscripts to modern first editions. The Semitics/Institute of Christian Oriental Research (ICOR) library supports research on the languages of the Bible and the ancient Near East. A special autonomous library, the Oliveira Lima Library, sometimes referred to as the Ibero-American Library, houses one of the largest collections of rare books on history and literature of Portuguese Brazilian culture outside of Brazil.

===Academic freedom===
====Dismissal of Professor Charles Curran====
In 1967, a tenured professor of theology, Reverend Charles E. Curran, was fired for his views on birth control but was reinstated after a five-day faculty-led strike. In 1986, the Vatican declared that Curran could no longer teach theology at Catholic University after the Curia department in charge of promulgating Catholic doctrine, headed by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, decided he was unfit. The areas of dispute included publishing articles that debated theological and ethical views regarding divorce, artificial contraception, masturbation, pre-marital intercourse, and homosexual acts.

A report American Association of University Professors noted, &quot;Had it not been for the intervention of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Professor Curran would undoubtedly still be active in the university&#x27;s Department of Theology, a popular teacher, honored theologian, and respected colleague.&quot; Curran&#x27;s attorneys argued that CUA did not follow proper procedures or its policy statements in handling the case. In response, CUA claimed that the Vatican&#x27;s actions against Curran trumped any campus-based policy or tenure rules. In 1989, Curran filed suit against Catholic University, claiming unlawful termination. Curran&#x27;s case was ultimately dismissed; the court found Catholic University had the right to fire Curran for teaching theology from a viewpoint that contradicted the school&#x27;s religion.

In 1990, the AAUP defended Curran and censured Catholic University&#x27;s administration for failing to adhere to the AAUP&#x27;s Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure. The AAUP found that &quot;unsatisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure have been found to prevail&quot; at The Catholic University of America. , the administration of Catholic University remains on the list of censured institutions. AAUP censure is a purely symbolic designation that does not effect an institution&#x27;s accreditation or the standing of AAUP members and prospective members on the faculty at a school whose administration remains under censure.

The administration of Catholic University has consistently reached out to the AAUP to explore lifting the censure. The two conditions for having the censure removed are inviting Curran, whose license to teach Catholic theology had been suspended by the Vatican, back to campus and changing the university&#x27;s &quot;Statement on Academic Freedom&quot;. President David M. O&#x27;Connell refused to do either, saying, &quot;every American university has a right to govern itself according to its own identity, mission, standards, and procedures.&quot; The Vatican&#x27;s decision regarding Curran&#x27;s qualifications to teach Catholic theology was made unilaterally and is unlikely to change unless Curran&#x27;s stances come into compliance with church teachings. The Catholic University of America&#x27;s bylaws require the school to comply with relevant Vatican policies and designates that the Archbishop of Washington D.C., who is chosen by the Vatican, is &quot;ex officio&quot; the school&#x27;s chancellor. This system makes it extremely unlikely Catholic University will amend the school&#x27;s charter and come into compliance with the current conditions expressed by the AAUP for lifting their censure of the school&#x27;s administration.

====Speaker policy====
The university as a policy does not allow outside guests to speak on campus to any audience if they have previously expressed an opinion on abortion or other serious issues conflicting with the Catholic Church&#x27;s teaching. Applying this policy in 2004, CUA was criticized for rescinding Stanley Tucci&#x27;s invitation for a seminar about Italian cinema, because he had lent past support for Planned Parenthood.

The next year, in 2005, the school was criticized for initially rejecting an application for recognition of a student chapter of the NAACP; one of the reasons officials cited in its rejection was the national organization&#x27;s pro-choice stance. In 2006 the CUA administration barred a student-run on-campus performance of Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;.

In 2009, the school made its speaker policy more stringent, prohibiting all candidates for political office from speaking on campus. Representatives of both Democratic and Republican clubs on campus have criticized the decision.

In January 2024, the university terminated a psychology lecturer who had invited a guest speaker whose &quot;views on life issues and on the anthropology of the human person were not consistent with our mission and identity as a faithful Catholic university.&quot;

==Demographics==
The student population in 2019 was 5,059. Approximately 91% of undergraduates receive some form of financial aid. There are slightly more female students at 53%, and a 1:7 faculty to student ratio. 83.8% of full-time faculty have a terminal degree.

==Student life==
There are over 100 registered student clubs and organizations at CUA for a wide variety of interests including athletics, academics, social, Greek life, service, political and religious. Annual events include week-long Homecoming celebrations, the Mr. CUA competition, and several dances including the Beaux Arts Ball, the Mistletoe Ball, and the Athletes Ball. In addition to radio station WCUA, other campus media outlets include &quot;The Crosier&quot;, a scholarly publication concerning Catholic social teaching, &quot;The Tower&quot;, the campus&#x27; independent weekly newspaper, and &quot;CRUX&quot;, a literary magazine. Although Catholic University states that it does not have any Greek life on campus, it has three Greek social organizations and one Greek service organization. Catholic University Greek life includes Alpha Delta Gamma, the national Catholic social fraternity–Kappa chapter, and Kappa Tau Gamma, the local Christian social-service sorority. Although not officially recognized by the university, the Sigma-Psi chapter of Kappa Sigma fraternity received an official charter in 2014. The members are all students of the university and are active on and around the campus. Alpha Phi Omega, a national service fraternity, has Zeta Mu chapter first chartered in 1950.

===Music and drama===
The music and drama programs, as part of a class, stage productions each semester, performances ranging from Broadway productions to plays and operas. Catholic University students also participate in a symphony orchestra and choral groups, including a cappella groups Take Note, RedLine, and the Washingtones.

There have been several songs associated with the university over the years. The most recent fight song, written by Steve Schatz, was adopted in 2002. The original fight song, &quot;The Flying Cardinals&quot;, dates back to before the 1930s. There are two alma maters, considered to be the university&#x27;s official songs. The first, &quot;Hail CUA&quot; was set to music composed by Victor Herbert and was adopted in 1920. The other, &quot;Guardians of Truth&quot; by Fr. Thomas McLean, actually came in 2nd place in the 1920 competition but was widely adopted in the ensuing years.

Albert Von Tilzer, composer of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;, wrote two songs for the university, &quot;We&#x27;re Rooting For You&quot; and &quot;CU Will Shine Tonight&quot;. The earliest sports song, &quot;Through the Town&quot;, dates from 1916. &quot;Drink a Highball&quot; was a popular song during Prohibition. In honor of the university&#x27;s 125th anniversary, an hour-long nostalgic musical revue was performed.

===Campus ministry and religious life===
84% of undergraduates and 59% of graduate students self-identify as Catholic. The campus ministry has two groups of student ministers: the resident ministers, who live in residence halls and focus primarily on upperclassmen, and the house members, who focus on first year freshmen.

The Friday Night Planning Committee works with the house members to plan activities for Friday nights that are alcohol-free. Campus ministry also coordinates university liturgies, plans and runs retreats, and operates the online Prayernet.

==Athletics==
Catholic University of America&#x27;s athletic teams are the Catholic University Cardinals. The university is a member of the Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Landmark Conference for most of its sports since the 2007–08 academic year. They are associate members of the Mid-Atlantic Rowing Conference for rowing. The team colors are red (PMS 1805) and black. The first recorded football game was played against Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s College on November 28, 1895, but records indicate earlier track and field events.

The university beat the University of Mississippi at the second Orange Bowl in 1936, 20–19. They also tied the Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe (now Arizona State University) in the 1940 Sun Bowl. The basketball Cardinals played in the 1944 NCAA basketball tournament, finishing as the Eastern Fourth Place team in the eight-team era of the tournament. They lost to runner-up Dartmouth College 63-38 in the regional semifinals, and Temple University 55-35 in the regional consolation game.

CUA competes in 25 NCAA Division III intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, rowing, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

===Non-varsity sports===
Students field club teams in sports including cheerleading, ice hockey, rugby, sailing, and lacrosse.

*The ice hockey team competes in the Delaware Valley Collegiate Hockey Conference (DVCHC) of the ACHA and plays at the Fort Dupont Ice Arena in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="604201" wikidata="Q2437020" url="?curid=604201" title="Florent Carton (Dancourt)">
<text>Florent Carton aka Dancourt (1 November 16617 December 1725), French dramatist and actor, was born at Fontainebleau. He belonged to a family of rank, and his parents entrusted his education to Pere de la Rue, a Jesuit, who made earnest efforts to induce him to join the order. But he had no religious vocation and proceeded to study law.

He practised at the bar for some time, but his marriage to the daughter of the comedian Francois Lenoir de la Thorilliere led him to become an actor, and in 1685, in spite of the strong opposition of his family, he appeared at the Theatre Francais. His gifts as a comedian gave him immediate and marked success, both with the public and with his fellow actors. He was the spokesman of his company on occasions of state, and in this capacity he frequently appeared before Louis XIV., who treated him with great favour.

One of his most famous impersonations was Alceste in Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;. His first play, &quot;Le Notaire obligeant&quot;, produced in 1685, was well received. &quot;La Désolation des joueuses&quot; (1687) was still more successful. &quot;Le Chevalier à la mode&quot; (1687) is generally regarded as his best work, though his claim to original authorship in this and some other cases has been disputed. In &quot;Le Chevalier à la mode&quot; appears the bourgeoise infatuated with the desire to be an aristocrat. The type is developed in &quot;Les Bourgeoises de la mode&quot; (1692) and &quot;Les Bourgeoises de qualité&quot; (1700). Dancourt was a prolific author, and produced some sixty plays in all, including &quot;Le Diable boiteux&quot; (1707, an adaptation of the eponymous novel from Lesage).

Some years before his death he terminated his career both as an actor and as an author by retiring to his chateau at Courcelles le Roi, in Berry, where he employed himself in making a poetical translation of the Psalms and in writing a sacred tragedy.

The plays of Dancourt are faithful descriptions of the manners of the time, and as such have real historical value. The characters are drawn with a realistic touch that led to his being styled by Charles Palissot the Teniers of comedy. He is very successful in his delineation of low life, and especially of the peasantry. The dialogue is sparkling, witty and natural. Many of the incidents of his plots were derived from actual occurrences in the fast and scandalous life of the period, and several of his characters were drawn from well-known personages of the day. Most of the plays incline to the type of farce rather than of pure comedy. Voltaire defined his talent in the words: &quot;What Regnard was in respect to Moliere in the high comedy, Dancourt was in the farce.&quot; ()

His two daughters, Manon and Marie-Anne (Mimi), both obtained success on the stage of the Théâtre Francais.

<text>The Decemberists are an American indie rock band from Portland, Oregon, formed in 2000. The band consists of Colin Meloy (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Funk (guitar, multi-instrumentalist), Jenny Conlee (piano, keyboards, accordion, backing vocals), Nate Query (bass), and John Moen (drums).

, the band has released nine studio albums with their lyrics often focusing on historical incidents and folklore. Audience participation is a part of their live performances, typically during encores. The band stages whimsical reenactments of sea battles and other centuries-old events, typically of regional interest, or acts out songs with members of the crowd.

In 2011, the track &quot;Down by the Water&quot; from their album &quot;The King Is Dead&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards.

==History==

===2000: Formation===
The Decemberists formed in 2000 when Colin Meloy left his band Tarkio in Montana and moved to Portland, Oregon. There he met Nate Query, who introduced Meloy to Jenny Conlee (they had played together in the band Calobo) and the three scored a silent film together. Playing a solo show prior to meeting Query, Meloy met Chris Funk. Funk was a fan of Tarkio and played pedal steel on the first two Decemberists releases, not &quot;officially&quot; becoming a member until the third effort. The band&#x27;s first drummer, Ezra Holbrook, was replaced by Rachel Blumberg after &quot;Castaways and Cutouts&quot;, who in turn was replaced by John Moen after &quot;Picaresque&quot;. The band&#x27;s name refers to the Decembrist revolt, an 1825 insurrection in Imperial Russia. Meloy has stated that the name is also meant to invoke the &quot;drama and melancholy&quot; of the month of December. &quot;5 Songs&quot;, the band&#x27;s debut extended play, was self-released in 2001. The members at that time played for several hours in a McMenamins hotel the night before to raise the money needed to record in the studio the next day. This originally served as a demo tape and the five songs on it (minus &quot;Apology Song&quot;) were recorded in under two hours.

===2003–2005: Kill Rock Stars===
After releasing its first full record, &quot;Castaways and Cutouts&quot;, on Hush Records, the group moved onto the Kill Rock Stars recording label. After the re-release of &quot;Castaways&quot;, &quot;Her Majesty the Decemberists&quot; was released in 2003. In 2004, the band released &quot;The Tain&quot;, an eighteen-and-a-half minute single track based on the Irish mythological epic . The band&#x27;s final album with Kill Rock Stars was &quot;Picaresque&quot;, which was recorded in a former church.

In March 2005, the band distributed a music video via BitTorrent, the self-produced &quot;16 Military Wives&quot; (from &quot;Picaresque&quot;). In the same month, the band&#x27;s equipment trailer was stolen; fans contributed to a replacement fund, and another fundraiser was organized via an eBay auction, with buyers bidding for copies of &quot;Colin Meloy Sings Morrissey&quot; and original artwork by Carson Ellis. The band also received help from Lee Kruger, the Shins, The Dandy Warhols, and other musicians. C.F. Martin &amp; Company offered 6- and 12-string guitars on permanent loan. In early April, police discovered the trailer and a portion of the band&#x27;s merchandise in Clackamas, Oregon, but the instruments and equipment were not recovered.

===2005–2006: Capitol Records debut and &quot;The Crane Wife&quot;===
On December 12, 2005, Meloy revealed to Pitchfork Media that the band had signed to Capitol Records, and planned to begin recording their major label debut with producers Tucker Martine and Chris Walla (of Death Cab for Cutie) in April 2006. The band&#x27;s first album on Capitol, &quot;The Crane Wife&quot;, was released on October 3, 2006. The release was accompanied by an appearance the same day on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, during which the band performed &quot;O Valencia!&quot;. The supporting tour (called &quot;The Rout of the Patagons Tour&quot;) began on October 17, 2006, at Portland, Oregon&#x27;s Crystal Ballroom. The opening act was Lavender Diamond. Later in the tour, Alasdair Roberts opened for the band. In 2006, &quot;The Crane Wife&quot; was voted NPR listeners&#x27; favorite album of the year, as announced on the December 5 episode of &quot;All Songs Considered&quot;, and it remains one of the Decemberists&#x27; most critically acclaimed records.

In November 2006, the band encouraged fans to create a music video for the single &quot;O Valencia!&quot; using footage of the band in front of a green screen. On his Comedy Central program, Stephen Colbert started a mock feud with the band, claiming his &quot;green screen challenge&quot; came first; the band countered that its 2005 on-stage lightsaber fight in San Francisco preceded Colbert&#x27;s idea.
The feud culminated in a December 20 guitar solo competition on Colbert&#x27;s show, with lead guitarist Funk representing the band. After Colbert feigned a hand injury, Peter Frampton took over for Colbert and won an audience vote. Show guests got involved, with New York Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer and Dr. Henry Kissinger declaring, &quot;Tonight, I think the American people won.&quot; The prize for winning the challenge was revealed to be a copy of &quot;The Crane Wife&quot;. According to Meloy, the Colbert challenge was not scripted, though the band was told that Frampton would step in for Colbert. The song &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; was performed by characters in the ninth season of the American comedy television series &quot;The Office&quot;. It originally aired on NBC on March 14, 2013. 

===2007: &quot;A Bit of Grass-Stain Does Not a Ruined Pair of Jeans Make&quot; tour===
In July 2007, the band embarked on a five-date tour with a full orchestral accompaniment. On July 7, the tour put the band on the stage of the historic Hollywood Bowl for the first time, pairing them with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. On July 15, the band performed with The Mann Festival Orchestra at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they debuted a new song. On July 23 with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra at the legendary Chastain Park Amphitheater in Atlanta, Georgia. The band then played a free concert in Chicago at the Millennium Park with the Grant Park Symphony Orchestra.

On October 6, 2007, the band announced the cancellation of the remainder of their European tour, citing the ill health of a band member. On November 1, 2007, the band further canceled the remaining 28 shows of their &quot;Long and Short of It&quot; tour.

===2008: &quot;Always the Bridesmaid&quot;===
The members of The Decemberists appeared, individually billed (as &quot;Colin Meloy, Chris Funk, Jenny Conlee, Nate Query, and John Moen&quot;), to perform in support of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama at a rally at the Tom McCall Waterfront Park in Portland, Oregon, on May 18, 2008. On October 14, 2008 the band began releasing a series of singles called &quot;Always the Bridesmaid&quot;; a volume was released every month until the end of the year. The band also took up a limited tour in support of the singles, including an appearance on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

===2009: &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot;===
&quot;The Hazards of Love&quot; was released on March 24, 2009 on Capitol Records, under Red Light Management (Jason Colton and Ron Laffitte). It was made available for download on iTunes one week earlier, on March 17, 2009. The track &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Song&quot; was put up for download on The Decemberists website in advance of the album&#x27;s release. During Meloy&#x27;s 2008 U.S. tour, he played several new songs that were included on the album. The album was produced by Tucker Martine.

In a post on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Daily&quot; blog, the band revealed more details about the album. The original plan was for &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot; to be a staged musical. However, it seems that the story was &quot;unstageable&quot; in such a format. Instead the band played the entire album start to finish at each concert on the spring tour. A press release read: &quot;The album began when Meloy – long fascinated by the British folk revival of the 1960s – found a copy of revered vocalist Anne Briggs&#x27;s 1966 EP, titled &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot;. Since there was no actual song with the album&#x27;s title, he set out to write one, but was soon immersed in something much larger. &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot; tells the tale of a woman named Margaret; her shape-shifting lover, William; his fey forest queen mother; and a cold-blooded, lascivious rake, who recounts with spine-chilling ease how he came &quot;to be living so easy and free&quot; in &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Song&quot;. Lavender Diamond&#x27;s Becky Stark and My Brightest Diamond&#x27;s Shara Nova deliver the lead vocals for the female characters, while My Morning Jacket&#x27;s Jim James, Robyn Hitchcock and The Spinanes&#x27; Rebecca Gates appear in supporting roles. The range of sounds reflects the characters&#x27; arcs, from the accordion&#x27;s singsong lilt in &quot;Isn&#x27;t it a Lovely Night?&quot; to the heavy metal thunder of &#x27;The Queen&#x27;s Rebuke/The Crossing.

On February 9, 2009, the Decemberists announced in a newsletter to fans that they would be embarking on the first leg of the &quot;A Short Fazed Hovel&quot; Tour 2009 starting on May 19 in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Palladium. The newsletter included a complete list of dates for the first leg of the tour ending on June 14 at the Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. On Monday April 27, the band performed a shortened version of &quot;The Wanting Comes in Waves/Repaid&quot; on The Colbert Report.

On August 14, 2009, the Decemberists played in Pittsburgh at the Benedum Center. During the show, the band members performed a skit where they ran up and down the aisles participating in a fictitious battle at Fort Pitt.

On September 19, 2009, The Decemberists played a &quot;lottery show&quot;, originally billed as a &quot;by request&quot; show, at Terminal 5 in New York City. The setlist was composed of songs drawn from a large bingo turner kept on stage. The master of ceremonies for the evening was singer/songwriter John Wesley Harding and the opening act was Laura Veirs and the Hall of Flames. The randomized setlist included &quot;July, July!&quot;, &quot;Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)&quot;, &quot;The Tain I-V&quot;, &quot;Annan Water&quot;, &quot;The Crane Wife 3&quot; and &quot;The Island/Come and See/The Landlord&#x27;s Daughter/You&#x27;ll Not Feel the Drowning&quot;, and an original song, as a bingo ball suggested, called &quot;Miracle on the Hudson&quot;.

In 2009, The Decemberists also contributed the song &quot;Sleepless&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot;, which was produced by the Red Hot Organization.

During their European tour in the winter of 2010, the band performed &quot;The Mariner&#x27;s Revenge Song&quot; at the conclusion of each date. The audience was encouraged to scream as if they were being consumed by a whale mentioned in the track&#x27;s narrative while the band pretended to die on stage.

===2010–2011: &quot;The King Is Dead&quot; and hiatus===
The Decemberists remained off tour as they embarked on a new studio album. On September 4, 2010, the band opened for Neko Case and the headliner, Bob Dylan, the first day of the Bumbershoot Arts and Music Festival in Seattle, WA. There, they announced that they were wrapping up recording of a new album and debuted three of its tracks. &quot;The King Is Dead&quot; was released on January 14, 2011, with Peter Buck of R.E.M. contributing instrumentation to three of its songs. Colin Meloy later affirmed that R.E.M. had been an inspiration during the writing and recording of some of the album&#x27;s material. &quot;Down by the Water&quot;, a track from the new album, was released via the band&#x27;s official site on November 2, and was immediately available on iTunes as a free download. The song would later be nominated for Best Rock Song at the 54th Grammy Awards. &quot;The King Is Dead&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States upon its release, the first time a Decemberists album would achieve this. As compared to the band&#x27;s previous work, which was influenced by the music of the British folk revival, &quot;The King Is Dead&quot; was more influenced by traditionally American genres including country, blues, and Americana.

The Decemberists&#x27; &quot;Popes of Pendarvia World Tour&quot; in support of &quot;The King Is Dead&quot; began with a show on January 25, 2011 at Beacon Theatre in New York City. The tour, which included engagements throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe, ended on August 26 at the McMenamins Edgefield in Troutdale, Oregon. During the tour, on May 3, it was announced on The Decemberists&#x27; official site that Jenny Conlee had been diagnosed with breast cancer and would miss most of the band&#x27;s remaining tour dates while receiving treatment and recovering. In support of their bandmate, the band designed a &#x27;Team Jenny&#x27; charity t-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money for Planned Parenthood. Conlee would later make a full recovery after her cancer went into remission.

Meanwhile, on April 7, 2011, the band released a music video for their song &quot;This Is Why We Fight&quot;. Directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, the video depicts a band of teenagers living in a bleak, post-apocalyptic society. Disgusted with the tyrannical rule of their &quot;king&quot;, one boy and one girl lead a splinter group away from the camp. Outraged, the king and his forces attack, but the video cuts to black before any resolution can be seen. In August, an eight-song set was released on iTunes featuring six previously released tracks and two new covers: Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hey, That&#x27;s No Way To Say Goodbye&quot; and the Fruit Bats&#x27; &quot;When U Love Somebody&quot;. Later that month, a new music video was debuted for the track entitled &quot;Calamity Song&quot;. The video depicts a game, played on a tennis court by children, of simulated thermonuclear war as described in the &quot;Eschaton&quot; scene of David Foster Wallace&#x27;s novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;.

Meloy announced during the &quot;Popes of Pendarvia&quot; tour that the group would take a multi-year hiatus once the touring cycle was over. To cap off this period of activity, the band released the follow-up outtake EP &quot;Long Live the King&quot; on November 1, 2011, as well as a live album from their tour for &quot;The King is Dead&quot; titled &quot;We All Raise Our Voices to the Air (Live Songs 04.11–08.11)&quot; on March 13, 2012. In addition, the band recorded a song for &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; soundtrack, called &quot;One Engine&quot;. The soundtrack, &quot;The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond&quot;, was released on March 20, 2012.

While on hiatus, the group&#x27;s only activity as The Decemberists was a cameo appearance on the 7th episode in the 24th season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in which the band was rendered in the show&#x27;s traditional style of animation and presented as the hip, new music teachers of Springfield Elementary. As well, the episode&#x27;s theme music was performed with the signature folk flair of The Decemberists.

===2014–2015: &quot;What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World&quot; ===
During a solo tour in 2013, Meloy announced that The Decemberists would end their hiatus and begin working on a new album within the next year. The hiatus officially concluded on March 5, 2014, with the announcement of two headlining shows at Portland&#x27;s Crystal Ballroom, the band&#x27;s first shows in three years, where they played their debut album, &quot;Castaways and Cutouts&quot;, in its entirety. On April 24, further establishing their return, the band performed on the Season 6 finale of the NBC comedy series &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. Additionally, The Decemberists were the mystery band for the 2014 Boston Calling Music Festival, where they played on Saturday, May 24.

On November 3, 2014, &quot;Make You Better&quot;, The Decemberists&#x27; first single off the new album, was released, and on January 20, 2015, the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World&quot;, was released. To commemorate both the release of the new album and the Decemberists&#x27; success as a whole, January 20 was officially declared &quot;Decemberists Day&quot; in the group&#x27;s hometown of Portland, Oregon, by mayor Charlie Hales.

In support of the album, The Decemberists made late-night appearances on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and &quot;Conan&quot;, and on February 11, embarked on a European tour which included dates in Ireland, the UK, The Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. A North American tour began on March 21, 2015, in the band&#x27;s hometown of Portland, Oregon.

On October 9, 2015, The Decemberists released a five-track EP compiled from leftover tracks recorded during the &quot;What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World&quot; sessions entitled &quot;florasongs&quot;.

===2017–2018: &quot;Offa Rex&quot;===
A collaborative album titled &quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot; with UK folk artist Olivia Chaney was released under the name &quot;Offa Rex&quot; on Nonesuch Records on July 14, 2017. The album is composed mainly of versions of traditional and British folk revival songs from the 1970s. U.S. tour dates were announced for July and August 2017. In late 2017, the band contributed &quot;Ben Franklin&#x27;s Song&quot;, with lyrics by &quot;Hamilton&quot; creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, to Miranda&#x27;s monthly &quot;Hamildrops&quot;.

===2018–present: &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Girl&quot; and &quot;As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again&quot;===
On January 17, 2018, the band announced the new album &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Girl&quot;, released on March 16. The album is produced by John Congleton and was accompanied by a tour. On August 14, the band&#x27;s concert at Prospect Park Bandshell (part of the BRIC Celebrate Brooklyn Festival) was broadcast live on WFUV. Along with newer material, the band performed &quot;The Crane Wife&quot; in its entirety. On December 14 of that year, they released an EP, &quot;Traveling On&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; highlighted that the band had planned a 2020 tour for their twentieth anniversary; however, it &quot;was bumped to 2021 before being canceled outright&quot;. The group celebrated their twentieth anniversary with a series of streamed concerts in April 2021. Their North American tour in August 2022 was titled &quot;Arise From The Bunkers&quot;.

In September 2023, the band began work on their ninth studio album. On February 6, 2024, the band announced the release of new song &quot;Burial Ground&quot; and a forthcoming North American tour. On March 19, they released the song &quot;Joan in the Garden&quot; and announced their album would be called &quot;As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again&quot;. The album was released on June 14, 2024, on YABB Records.

==Musical style==

The group&#x27;s songs range from upbeat pop to instrumentally lush ballads, and often employ instruments like the accordion, keyboards, and upright bass. In its lyrics, the band eschews the introspection common to modern rock, instead favoring a storytelling approach, as evidenced in songs such as &quot;My Mother Was a Chinese Trapeze Artist&quot; from the &quot;5 Songs&quot; EP and &quot;The Mariner&#x27;s Revenge Song&quot; on &quot;Picaresque&quot;. The band&#x27;s songs convey tales ranging from whimsical (&quot;The Sporting Life&quot;, &quot;Apology Song&quot;) to epic (&quot;The Tain&quot;) to dark (&quot;Odalisque&quot;, &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Song&quot;) to political (&quot;16 Military Wives&quot;, &quot;Valerie Plame&quot;), and often invoke historical events and themes from around the world (&quot;Yankee Bayonet&quot;, &quot;Shankill Butchers&quot;).

Their musical style has been described as indie rock, baroque pop, indie pop, indie folk, alternative rock, folk rock, and orchestral pop. The band&#x27;s 2009 release, &quot;The Hazards of Love&quot;, supplemented their usual folk and alternative style with progressive rock and metal.

===Influences and character===
Meloy confessed a &quot;slavish love&quot; for Morrissey, one of his principal influences, to whom he has a tattoo dedicated, and has made &quot;a sort of pilgrimage&quot; to the site of the cover photograph for The Waterboys&#x27; &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Blues&quot;, an album he “wore out from obsessively repeated listens.&quot; The band has also cited their liking for Siouxsie and the Banshees, and the pop tunes of R.E.M. and XTC. The band also draws inspiration from British and Irish folk music.

<doc id="604206" wikidata="Q1187907" url="?curid=604206" title="Think and Grow Rich">
<text>Think and Grow Rich is a book written by Napoleon Hill and Rosa Lee Beeland released in 1937 and promoted as a personal development and self-improvement book. He claimed to be inspired by a suggestion from business magnate and later-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.

The book is considered a classic in the personal development genre and has been widely influential in shaping the way people think about success and wealth.

== History ==
In 1935, Napoleon Hill&#x27;s second wife Florence filed for and received a divorce. In 1936, Napoleon met Rosa Lee Beeland when she attended one of his lectures. He proposed the next day and they were soon married. Unable to afford a place of their own, they moved in with Hill and Florence&#x27;s son, Blair, in New York City. Following a few months of this living arrangement, Blair&#x27;s wife, Vera, left due to Hill&#x27;s harassment and abuse. Blair left shortly thereafter. Before leaving, however, Blair gave his father and Rosa a loan to continue work on their new book, &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;.

&quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; was published in 1937 and became a major commercial success. Beeland contributed substantially to the authoring and editing of &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;. Hill and Beeland divorced in 1940, with the latter retaining the royalties from the book, given that they had been put in her name to protect them from any claims made by Hill&#x27;s second wife, Florence, and her children. Hill and Beeland reportedly never repaid Blair for the $300 loan with Rosa taunting Blair about the matter.

==Summary==
&quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; is based on Hill&#x27;s earlier work &quot;The Law of Success&quot;, claims to be the result of more than twenty years of study of many individuals who had amassed personal fortunes. Hill studied their habits and drew some 16 &quot;laws&quot; to be applied to achieve success. &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; condenses them, providing the reader with 14 principles in the form of a &quot;Philosophy of Achievement&quot;.

The main theme of the book is that anyone can achieve success and wealth by following a certain set of principles. Hill identified these principles as the &quot;13 Steps to Riches,&quot; which included developing a positive mental attitude, setting clear and specific goals, developing a plan to achieve those goals, taking action, and maintaining a strong belief in oneself and one&#x27;s capabilities. The 13 &quot;steps&quot; were:
* 1. Desire: Start with a strong desire or burning ambition to achieve a specific goal or outcome.
* 2. Faith: Have unwavering faith in yourself and your ability to achieve your goal.
* 3. Autosuggestion: Use positive self-talk and affirmations to reinforce your beliefs and goals.
* 4. Specialized knowledge: Acquire the knowledge and skills needed to achieve your goal.
* 5. Imagination: Use your imagination to visualize your goal and see yourself achieving it.
* 6. Organized planning: Develop a detailed plan of action to achieve your goal.
* 7. Decision: Make a firm decision to follow through on your plan and never give up.
* 8. Persistence: Keep working towards your goal, even when faced with obstacles or setbacks.
* 9. Power of the Master Mind: Surround yourself with like-minded people who support and encourage you.
* 10. The Mystery of Sex Transmutation: Use the power of your sexual energy to fuel your desire and drive.
* 11. The Subconscious Mind: Tap into the power of your subconscious mind to help you achieve your goals.
* 12. The Brain: Use your brain to analyze and plan, and to make decisions and take action.
* 13. The Sixth Sense: Trust your intuition and inner guidance to help you make the right decisions and achieve your goals.

== Accuracy ==
Although Hill claims to have had a pivotal conversation with Andrew Carnegie in 1908, there is no record of the two having met. Hill spent much of the year on the run from the authorities for committing lumber fraud in Alabama. Hill did not claim to have met Carnegie until after Carnegie&#x27;s death in 1918. Aside from Hill&#x27;s writings, there are no accounts of the meeting taking place. Carnegie biographer David Nasaw stated that he &quot;found no evidence of any sort that Carnegie and Hill ever met&quot; or &quot;that the book was authentic.&quot;

There are no known records of Hill meeting the famous men he claimed to have interviewed; that is, besides a brief encounter with Thomas Edison.

== Influence ==
First published during the Great Depression, it remains the biggest seller of Napoleon Hill&#x27;s books. &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; magazine&#x27;s Best-Seller List ranked it the sixth best-selling paperback business book 70 years after it was published. &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; is listed in John C. Maxwell&#x27;s &quot;A Lifetime &quot;Must Read&quot; Books List.&quot;

Hill&#x27;s biographers would later say this book sold 20 million copies over 50 years, although as Richard Lingeman remarks in his brief biography, &quot;Alice Payne Hackett&#x27;s &#x27;70 Years of Best Sellers&#x27; suggests the amount was considerably less.&quot;

<text>José de Mora (1642–1724) was a Spanish sculptor.

José de Mora was born in Baza. He was the oldest son of the sculptor Bernardo de Mora and pupil of Alonso Cano in Granada and of Sebastián de Herrera in Madrid. In 1669, two years after the death of Cano, he moved to Madrid and worked with Sebastián de Herrera Barnuevo who also had been pupil of Cano. In 1672, he became a sculptor for the king Charles II and later left Madrid in 1680 and returned to Granada. He died in Granada in 1724 and was buried in the Convent of St. Anthony of the Discalced Franciscan Friars. His work can be usefully studied in the eight statues in the Chapel of Cardinal Salazar in the Mosque-Cathedral in Córdoba, and in the statues of Saint Bruno and Saint Joseph in the Charterhouse near Granada.

However, his main masterpiece was the sculpture of the &quot;Christ of Salvation&quot; (currently, &quot;Christ of Mercy&quot;), made for a funerary chapel in the Church of St. Gregory Baeticus in Granada. The origins of this great sculpture were unknown until the year 2018, when Dr. José Antonio Díaz (Art historian from the University of Granada), discovered and published the documents which reveal all the information about this relevant sculpture of the Spanish Baroque. Furthermore, the sculpture of &quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot; made for the Oratory of St. Philip Neri of Granada (currently, in the Church of St. Anne) is known as the second best work carved by José de Mora.

<doc id="604221" wikidata="Q7348050" url="?curid=604221" title="Robert Nixon (comics)">
<text>Robert Nixon (7 July 1939 – 22 October 2002) was an artist who worked on several British comics.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Nixon was born in South Bank, Middlesbrough, in North Yorkshire on 7 July 1939. He was the fifth of six children born to Arthur Nixon and Phylis Thompson. Robert&#x27;s mother Phylis worked as a housewife while his father worked locally as a steelworker.

As a child, Nixon spent much of his time drawing and sketching, and his artistic skills were recognised when he was seven years old by teachers at Cromwell Road School which he attended in South Bank. During his early years as an artist, and supported by teachers at the Central Secondary Modern School (Victoria Street, Southbank), Nixon won several art competitions and a scholarship to Middlesbrough Art College in 1955 when he was sixteen.
Although his time at art college was cut short by the death of his father, Nixon gained employment locally as a lithographic artist and left in 1965 to pursue his career as a full-time cartoonist, initially for DC Thomson of Dundee.

During this transition, Nixon met and married Rita Kelly and after living in Middlesbrough for several years they moved to Guisborough, North Yorkshire, where they raised their four children Paul, Tony, Wendy and Catherine.

=== Career ===
In &quot;The Beano&quot;, he started out drawing &quot;Little Plum&quot; in the early 1960s after Leo Baxendale left DC Thomson. He later took over &quot;Roger the Dodger&quot; from Ken Reid and &quot;Lord Snooty&quot; from Dudley D. Watkins, and revived &quot;Grandpa&quot;, another Ken Reid creation, in the early 1970s in the same comic, as well as &quot;Captain Cutler&quot; and &quot;His Butler and Esky Mo&quot; in &quot;Sparky&quot;. He left DC Thomson shortly afterwards, and started to work at IPC Magazines (Fleetway), drawing such characters as &quot;Kid Kong&quot;, &quot;Frankie Stein&quot; (not to be confused with the &quot;Monster High&quot; character of the same name) and &quot;Gums&quot;.

Nixon drew &quot;The 12½p Buytonic Boy&quot; for &quot;Krazy&quot;, although Brian Walker frequently deputised when Nixon was on leave. The strip first appeared in issue 1, dated 16 October 1976.

Nixon returned to DC Thomson in 1984 after being asked to by new &quot;Beano&quot; editor Euan Kerr, and began drawing &quot;Roger the Dodger&quot; again, as well as creating &quot;Ivy the Terrible&quot; in 1985. Later his friend Trevor Metcalfe drew this strip.

Nixon&#x27;s strips are still being reprinted in &quot;The Beano&quot;, appearing regularly as recently as 2011.

He would go on to draw &quot;Beryl the Peril&quot; in &quot;The Topper&quot; and Korky the Cat in &quot;The Dandy&quot; later on in the decade, and continue drawing them throughout the 1990s.

== Death ==
On 22 October 2002, Nixon died from a heart attack, aged 63.

<doc id="604223" wikidata="Q2214059" url="?curid=604223" title="Motorcycle Emptiness">
<text>&quot;Motorcycle Emptiness&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 1 June 1992 through Columbia Records. It was the fifth single to be released from their debut album, &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot;. The song reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart on 13 June 1992.

== Meaning ==

The track is inspired by S.E. Hinton&#x27;s book &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, about biker gang culture. According to the band, the lyrics are an attack on the hollowness of a lifestyle centred around the consumerism which is offered by capitalism, describing how society expects young people to conform. The line &quot;From feudal serf to spender&quot; draws a direct parallel between slavery of peasants to the lord of their manor under the Feudal system in medieval times and the brand loyalty of people in modern capitalist societies, which the companies use to their advantage in pursuit of profit.

== Background ==
The song was derived from the early Manic Street Preachers songs &quot;Go, Buzz Baby, Go&quot; (with which it shares the chord structure and the phrase &quot;Motorcycle Emptiness&quot; late in the song over the verse chords) and &quot;Behave Yourself Baby&quot;, a rough demo with a similar structure, that has the lines &quot;All we want from you is the skin you live within&quot;, similar to &quot;All we want from you are the kicks you&#x27;ve given us&quot; in this song.

Nicky Wire said of the song&#x27;s creative process &quot;A real amalgam. Part of a song called &quot;Go Buzz Baby Go&quot;, and before that was a song called &quot;Behave Yourself Baby&quot; which was the bridge. The lyric took a long time. We crammed so many words in there, and it is bizarre, so busy. It was the first time we looked at each other as a band and thought perhaps we can actually do something.&quot;

Sean Moore said &quot;It&#x27;s something like four songs put together. The main guitar part was the producer, Steve Brown, telling James that we needed a riff going through the song&quot;, while James Dean Bradfield recalled &quot;We&#x27;d had the demo for that since we were about 17, but played in more of a New Order style then. Steve Brown said it needed a solo, and he just left me in the studio and gave me an hour. He came back and went: &quot;You&#x27;re a guitar god now!&quot; It sounds corny, but he made this white-trash Taff feel good. He told me I had to find my Slash moment. That’s good production, as far as I’m concerned.&quot;

Some of the lyrics are taken from the poem &quot;Neon Loneliness&quot; (the first line of the chorus, &quot;Under neon loneliness&quot;, is a direct lift) by Welsh poet Patrick Jones, the brother of Manics bass guitarist and lyricist Nicky Wire. &quot;Motorcycle Emptiness&quot; was also included on &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;, the Manics&#x27; greatest hits album, in October 2002, and released as a reissued single from the compilation in February 2003.

== Release and reception ==

&quot;Motorcycle Emptiness&quot; was released on 1 June 1992 by record label Columbia. The song reached number 17 in the UK Singles Chart on 13 June 1992. It remained there for another week and spent a total of six weeks in the top 75, a fortnight longer than any other &quot;Generation Terrorists&quot; single, and a record not surpassed by the Manics until 1996&#x27;s &quot;A Design for Life&quot;.

In 2003, a re-issue CD containing the title track, &quot;4 Ever Delayed&quot; and &quot;Little Baby Nothing (Acoustic)&quot; was released in Europe as promotion for the band&#x27;s &quot;Forever Delayed&quot; greatest hits compilation.

Awarding it &#x27;Best New Single&#x27; in &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Tom Doyle wrote: &quot;Stripped of their punky backing, the Manics take a bit of a breather with this rousing classic of a tune which even features plucked violins!&quot; He added: &quot;[The single] proves that the Manics are much more than simply a punk parody and that they are capable of occasional brilliance.&quot;

== Music video ==

The video was filmed during a promotional visit to Japan in various locations, including the Shibuya Crossing and Cosmo Clock 21. It features the whole band, but with Bradfield appearing most, standing stationary and performing the song as crowds surge around him. The band appear in non-sequential shots, exploring the sites of Japan. At one point, Edwards appears trying to gain the attention of a tortoise.

== Remix ==

The song was remixed by Apollo-440 under their alternative name Stealth Sonic Orchestra as a piece of classical-style music. This remix was available as a track on the single &quot;Australia&quot; (taken from their 1996 album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;), and was also used by T-Mobile for an advertising campaign in 2003.

A contestant, David Martin, performed an acoustic version in 2002 during the knockout stages of the first series of the reality show, Fame Academy.

== Legacy ==

In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted the song as the 88th best song ever.

<doc id="604224" wikidata="Q422579" url="?curid=604224" title="Insulin receptor">
<text>The insulin receptor (IR) is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II and belongs to the large class of receptor tyrosine kinase. Metabolically, the insulin receptor plays a key role in the regulation of glucose homeostasis; a functional process that under degenerate conditions may result in a range of clinical manifestations including diabetes and cancer. Insulin signalling controls access to blood glucose in body cells. When insulin falls, especially in those with high insulin sensitivity, body cells begin only to have access to lipids that do not require transport across the membrane. So, in this way, insulin is the key regulator of fat metabolism as well. Biochemically, the insulin receptor is encoded by a single gene , from which alternate splicing during transcription results in either IR-A or IR-B isoforms. Downstream post-translational events of either isoform result in the formation of a proteolytically cleaved α and β subunit, which upon combination are ultimately capable of homo or hetero-dimerisation to produce the ≈320 kDa disulfide-linked transmembrane insulin receptor.

== Structure ==
Initially, transcription of alternative splice variants derived from the &quot;INSR&quot; gene are translated to form one of two monomeric isomers; IR-A in which exon 11 is excluded, and IR-B in which exon 11 is included. Inclusion of exon 11 results in the addition of 12 amino acids upstream of the intrinsic furin proteolytic cleavage site. 

Upon receptor dimerisation, after proteolytic cleavage into the α- and β-chains, the additional 12 amino acids remain present at the C-terminus of the α-chain (designated αCT) where they are predicted to influence receptor–ligand interaction.

Each isometric monomer is structurally organized into 8 distinct domains consists of; a leucine-rich repeat domain (L1, residues 1–157), a cysteine-rich region (CR, residues 158–310), an additional leucine rich repeat domain (L2, residues 311–470), three fibronectin type III domains; FnIII-1 (residues 471–595), FnIII-2 (residues 596–808) and FnIII-3 (residues 809–906). Additionally, an insert domain (ID, residues 638–756) resides within FnIII-2, containing the α/β furin cleavage site, from which proteolysis results in both IDα and IDβ domains. Within the β-chain, downstream of the FnIII-3 domain lies a transmembrane helix (TH) and intracellular juxtamembrane (JM) region, just upstream of the intracellular tyrosine kinase (TK) catalytic domain, responsible for subsequent intracellular signaling pathways.

Upon cleavage of the monomer to its respective α- and β-chains, receptor hetero or homo-dimerisation is maintained covalently between chains by a single disulphide link and between monomers in the dimer by two disulphide links extending from each α-chain. The overall 3D ectodomain structure, possessing four ligand binding sites, resembles an inverted &#x27;V&#x27;, with the each monomer rotated approximately 2-fold about an axis running parallel to the inverted &#x27;V&#x27; and L2 and FnIII-1 domains from each monomer forming the inverted &#x27;V&#x27;s apex.

== Ligand binding ==
The insulin receptor&#x27;s endogenous ligands include insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II. Using a cryo-EM, structural insight into conformational changes upon insulin binding was provided. Binding of ligand to the α-chains of the IR dimeric ectodomain shifts it from an inverted V-shape to a T-shaped conformation, and this change is propagated structurally to the transmembrane domains, which get closer, eventually leading to autophosphorylation of various tyrosine residues within the intracellular TK domain of the β-chain. These changes facilitate the recruitment of specific adapter proteins such as the insulin receptor substrate proteins (IRS) in addition to SH2-B (Src Homology 2 - B ), APS and protein phosphatases, such as PTP1B, eventually promoting downstream processes involving blood glucose homeostasis.

Strictly speaking the relationship between IR and ligand shows complex allosteric properties. This was indicated with the use of a Scatchard plots which identified that the measurement of the ratio of IR bound ligand to unbound ligand does not follow a linear relationship with respect to changes in the concentration of IR bound ligand, suggesting that the IR and its respective ligand share a relationship of cooperative binding. Furthermore, the observation that the rate of IR-ligand dissociation is accelerated upon addition of unbound ligand implies that the nature of this cooperation is negative; said differently, that the initial binding of ligand to the IR inhibits further binding to its second active site - exhibition of allosteric inhibition.

These models state that each IR monomer possesses 2 insulin binding sites; site 1, which binds to the &#x27;classical&#x27; binding surface of insulin: consisting of L1 plus αCT domains and site 2, consisting of loops at the junction of FnIII-1 and FnIII-2 predicted to bind to the &#x27;novel&#x27; hexamer face binding site of insulin. As each monomer contributing to the IR ectodomain exhibits 3D &#x27;mirrored&#x27; complementarity, N-terminal site 1 of one monomer ultimately faces C-terminal site 2 of the second monomer, where this is also true for each monomers mirrored complement (the opposite side of the ectodomain structure). Current literature distinguishes the complement binding sites by designating the second monomer&#x27;s site 1 and site 2 nomenclature as either site 3 and site 4 or as site 1&#x27; and site 2&#x27; respectively.
As such, these models state that each IR may bind to an insulin molecule (which has two binding surfaces) via 4 locations, being site 1, 2, (3/1&#x27;) or (4/2&#x27;). As each site 1 proximally faces site 2, upon insulin binding to a specific site, &#x27;crosslinking&#x27; via ligand between monomers is predicted to occur (i.e. as [monomer 1 Site 1 - Insulin - monomer 2 Site (4/2&#x27;)] or as [monomer 1 Site 2 - Insulin - monomer 2 site (3/1&#x27;)]). In accordance with current mathematical modelling of IR-insulin kinetics, there are two important consequences to the events of insulin crosslinking; 1. that by the aforementioned observation of negative cooperation between IR and its ligand that subsequent binding of ligand to the IR is reduced and 2. that the physical action of crosslinking brings the ectodomain into such a conformation that is required for intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation events to ensue (i.e. these events serve as the requirements for receptor activation and eventual maintenance of blood glucose homeostasis).

Applying cryo-EM and molecular dynamics simulations of receptor reconstituted in nanodiscs, the structure of the entire dimeric insulin receptor ectodomain with four insulin molecules bound was visualized, therefore confirming and directly showing biochemically predicted 4 binding locations.

* Insulin
* Insulin-like growth factor 1
* Mecasermin

A number of small-molecule insulin receptor agonists have been identified.

== Signal transduction pathway ==
The insulin receptor is a type of tyrosine kinase receptor, in which the binding of an agonistic ligand triggers autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues, with each subunit phosphorylating its partner. The addition of the phosphate groups generates a binding site for the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1), which is subsequently activated via phosphorylation. The activated IRS-1 initiates the signal transduction pathway and binds to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), in turn causing its activation. This then catalyses the conversion of Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 acts as a secondary messenger and induces the activation of phosphatidylinositol dependent protein kinase, which then activates several other kinases – most notably protein kinase B, (PKB, also known as Akt). PKB triggers the translocation of glucose transporter (GLUT4) containing vesicles to the cell membrane, via the activation of SNARE proteins, to facilitate the diffusion of glucose into the cell. PKB also phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase, which is an enzyme that inhibits glycogen synthase. Therefore, PKB acts to start the process of glycogenesis, which ultimately reduces blood-glucose concentration.

== Function ==

=== Regulation of gene expression ===
The activated IRS-1 acts as a secondary messenger within the cell to stimulate the transcription of insulin-regulated genes. First, the protein Grb2 binds the P-Tyr residue of IRS-1 in its SH2 domain. Grb2 is then able to bind SOS, which in turn catalyzes the replacement of bound GDP with GTP on Ras, a G protein. This protein then begins a phosphorylation cascade, culminating in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which enters the nucleus and phosphorylates various nuclear transcription factors (such as Elk1).

=== Stimulation of glycogen synthesis ===
Glycogen synthesis is also stimulated by the insulin receptor via IRS-1. In this case, it is the SH2 domain of PI-3 kinase (PI-3K) that binds the P-Tyr of IRS-1. Now activated, PI-3K can convert the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). This indirectly activates a protein kinase, PKB (Akt), via phosphorylation. PKB then phosphorylates several target proteins, including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3). GSK-3 is responsible for phosphorylating (and thus deactivating) glycogen synthase. When GSK-3 is phosphorylated, it is deactivated, and prevented from deactivating glycogen synthase. In this roundabout manner, insulin increases glycogen synthesis.

=== Degradation of insulin ===
Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment or it may be degraded by the cell. Degradation normally involves endocytosis of the insulin-receptor complex followed by the action of insulin degrading enzyme. Most insulin molecules are degraded by liver cells. It has been estimated that a typical insulin molecule is finally degraded about 71 minutes after its initial release into circulation.

=== Immune system ===
Besides the metabolic function, insulin receptors are also expressed on immune cells, such as macrophages, B cells, and T cells. On T cells, the expression of insulin receptors is undetectable during the resting state but up-regulated upon T-cell receptor (TCR) activation. Indeed, insulin has been shown when supplied exogenously to promote &quot;in vitro&quot; T cell proliferation in animal models. Insulin receptor signalling is important for maximizing the potential effect of T cells during acute infection and inflammation.

== Pathology ==
The main activity of activation of the insulin receptor is inducing glucose uptake. For this reason &quot;insulin insensitivity&quot;, or a decrease in insulin receptor signaling, leads to diabetes mellitus type 2 – the cells are unable to take up glucose, and the result is hyperglycemia (an increase in circulating glucose), and all the sequelae that result from diabetes.

Patients with insulin resistance may display acanthosis nigricans.

A few patients with homozygous mutations in the &quot;INSR&quot; gene have been described, which causes Donohue syndrome or Leprechaunism. This autosomal recessive disorder results in a totally non-functional insulin receptor. These patients have low-set, often protuberant, ears, flared nostrils, thickened lips, and severe growth retardation. In most cases, the outlook for these patients is extremely poor, with death occurring within the first year of life. Other mutations of the same gene cause the less severe Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, in which patients have characteristically abnormal teeth, hypertrophic gingiva (gums), and enlargement of the pineal gland. Both diseases present with fluctuations of the glucose level: After a meal the glucose is initially very high, and then falls rapidly to abnormally low levels. Other genetic mutations to the insulin receptor gene can cause Severe Insulin Resistance.

=== Roman Rite ===
In the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite, Easter is one of two solemnities with octaves; the other is Christmas. The days of the octave are given the second-highest rank in the calendar (second only to the Paschal Triduum and Easter itself), ranking even above normal solemnities. The paschal sequence may be sung before the gospel reading on each of these days.

The Gospel readings for each of middle days within the octave are taken from the various Scriptural accounts of the Resurrection of Jesus.

<doc id="604229" wikidata="Q5153498" url="?curid=604229" title="Common Time">
<text>&quot;Common Time&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer James Blish. It first appeared in the August 1953 issue of &quot;Science Fiction Quarterly&quot; and has been reprinted several times: in the 1959 short-story collection &quot;Galactic Cluster&quot;; in &quot;The Testament of Andros&quot; (1965); in &quot;The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus&quot; (1973); and in &quot;Isaac Asimov Presents the Great SF Stories&quot;.

The story is considered to be an archetype of symbolism in science fiction.

== Synopsis ==
A man named Garrard is a test pilot for an experimental space ship bound for Alpha Centauri. Previous attempts to make the trip have failed. Garrard is put in the ship in suspended animation and wakes up after the ship has gone into &quot;over-drive&quot;. The first thing he remembers is the injunction: &quot;Don&#x27;t move&quot;. Garrard realizes that ship time seems to be almost stopped relative to his conscious time; he is not breathing, and his muscles respond slowly to mental directions. He calculates that 6000 years of subjective time will pass before the ship reaches its goal. Suddenly, he realizes that ship time is speeding up, until it equals, then exceeds, his subjective time. As the differential time rates increase, he again loses control of his body and goes into &quot;pseudo-death&quot;.

Garrard awakes as the ship comes out of overdrive near Alpha Centauri. Around him in the space ship is a group of dreamlike beings that call themselves &quot;the clinesterton beademungen&quot; and speak to him in dream-language, which he understands perfectly. The story&#x27;s narrative also becomes dreamlike at this point, suggesting that Garrard&#x27;s experiences are indescribable. As the ship&#x27;s automatic mechanism is about to start the journey back to Earth, Garrard again goes into pseudo-death, and remains in that state until the ship nears Earth. He lands safely. He can no longer remember what the &quot;beademung&quot; was like or even if it was real, but he has a haunting sense of loss.

==Symbolism==
In &quot;In Search of Wonder&quot;, Damon Knight argues that the story is a symbolic representation of fertilization of a female ovum by a sperm, and that the protagonist Garrard is the sperm. The Earth represents the testes; Alpha Centauri is the uterus; and the beademung is the ovum. Furthermore, Knight argues, the first part of the story, which contains all the intercourse symbolism, is told backwards. Even the title, Knight argues, is an unintentional pun for &quot;Come on time&quot;.

==Author&#x27;s commentary==
James Blish (quoted by Damon Knight ) said about Knight&#x27;s interpretation of his story:

The reference to the Alpha Centauri stars as &#x27;the twin radioceles&#x27; obviously comes from &quot;varicocele&quot;, a common form of hernia involving the testicles, and I think now that the whole thing was suggested by the Earth-Moon balls on the cover around which I wrote the story. The main Alpha Centauri star and Proxima Centauri stand in about the same relationship as the Earth and the Moon, and both pairs might be described as one-hung-low. Also, the story &quot;is&quot; about love-and-death; it says it is. But I&#x27;m just now beginning to believe it. Writing frightens me.

<text>Felix Salten (; 6 September 1869 – 8 October 1945) was an Austrian author and literary critic. His most famous work is &quot;Bambi, a Life in the Woods&quot;, which was adapted into an animated feature film, &quot;Bambi&quot;, by Walt Disney Productions in 1942.

==Early life==
Salten was born Siegmund Salzmann on 6 September 1869 in Pest, Austria-Hungary. His father was Fülöp Salzmann, the telegraph office&#x27;s clerk in Pest; his mother was Maria Singer. He was the grandson of an Orthodox rabbi. When he was four weeks old, his family relocated to Vienna, as many Jews did after the Imperial government had granted full citizenship rights to Jews in 1867. 

As a teen, Felix changed his name to Salten in order to appear less Jewish, and considered converting to Catholicism due to the antisemitism he experienced from his Austrian neighbors and schoolmates. When his father went bankrupt, the sixteen-year-old Salten quit school and began working for an insurance agency.

==Literary career==
Salten then became part of the &quot;Young Vienna&quot; movement (&quot;Jung-Wien&quot;) and soon received work as a full-time art and theater critic for Vienna&#x27;s press (&quot;Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Zeit&quot;). In 1900, he published his first collection of short stories. In 1901, he initiated Vienna&#x27;s first, short-lived literary cabaret &quot;Jung-Wiener Theater Zum lieben Augustin&quot;.

He was soon publishing, on an average, one book a year, of plays, short stories, novels, travel books, and essay collections. He also wrote for nearly all the major newspapers of Vienna. In 1906, Salten went to Ullstein as an editor in chief of the &quot;B.Z. am Mittag&quot; and the &quot;Berliner Morgenpost&quot;, but relocated to Vienna some months later. He wrote also film scripts and librettos for operettas. In 1927 he became president of the Austrian P.E.N. club as successor of Arthur Schnitzler.

His best remembered work is &quot;Bambi&quot; (1923). A translation in English was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1928, and became a Book-of-the-Month Club success. In 1933, he sold the film rights to the American director Sidney Franklin for only $1,000, and Franklin later transferred the rights to the Walt Disney Studios, which formed the basis of the animated film &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942).

Life in Austria became perilous for Jews during the 1930s. In Germany, Adolf Hitler had Salten&#x27;s books banned in 1936. Two years later, after Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria, Salten moved to Zürich, Switzerland, with his wife, and spent his final years there. Felix Salten died on 8 October 1945, at the age of 76. He is buried at Israelitischer Friedhof Unterer Friesenberg.

Salten is now considered the probable author of a successful erotic novel, &quot;Josephine Mutzenbacher: The Life Story of a Viennese Whore, as Told by Herself&quot; published anonymously in 1906, filled with social criticism.

==Zionism==
Inspired by fellow Austrian Jew Theodor Herzl, Salten became an outspoken advocate for the Zionist movement, which appealed to Salten&#x27;s sense of self-empowerment. Salten anonymously wrote a column for Herzl&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Die Welt,&quot; published a lengthy profile of Herzl after his 1904 death, and spoke at events sponsored by the Bar Kochba Society alongside Martin Buber.

==Personal life==
Salten married actress Ottilie Metzl (1868–1942) in 1902, and had two children: Paul (1903–1937) and Anna Katharina (1904–1977), who married Swiss actor Hans Rehmann. He composed another book based on the character of Bambi, titled &quot;Bambi’s Children: The Story of a Forest Family&quot; (1939). His stories &quot;Perri&quot; and &quot;The Hound of Florence&quot; inspired the Disney films &quot;Perri&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (1959), respectively.

Salten was an avid hunter.

<doc id="604235" wikidata="Q7987948" url="?curid=604235" title="Western Independence Party">
<text>The Western Independence Party (WIP) was a Canadian political party that advocated the separation of Western Canada from Canada to form a new country from the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and the Yukon and Northwest Territories.

The WIP ran eleven candidates in the 1988 federal election - one candidate in British Columbia, seven in Alberta, and three in Manitoba (although one of the Manitoba candidates appears to have withdrawn before election day). All the candidates were soundly defeated, with none garnering even 1% of the popular vote in any riding.

The party also had provincial branches in each of the four provinces. The federal wing of the Western Independence Party fell dormant and did not run any candidates in any federal elections after 1988. The party was resurrected in April 2005 at a founding convention in Strathmore, Alberta under the new name &quot;Western Canada Party&quot;.

The WIP should not be confused with the Confederation of Regions Party, which sought greater autonomy for western Canada, but not full independence.

==Founding==
The party was founded by a group of 150 people from across the western provinces. The WIP was formed because the group had grown dissatisfied with the direction of another western separatist party, the federal Western Canada Concept (WCC), led by a lawyer Douglas Christie of Victoria, B.C. At the party&#x27;s founding convention in October 1987 in Edmonton, Fred Marshall was elected interim leader. Marshall had run for the leadership of the provincial WCC in 1984, losing to future Reform Party Member of Parliament Jack Ramsay of Camrose, Alberta. Also at the founding convention, the party adopted the &quot;West Canada Flag&quot; which was designed by Dexter Dombro and was chosen from a field of eight other entries.

==WIP in Alberta / Alberta Independence Party==
Bob Lefurgey attempted to collect enough signatures to form official party status of the WIP as a provincially registered party in Alberta, but failed to obtain enough signatures. Lefurgey described his mission as separation. &quot;It&#x27;s basically to remove Alberta from confederation,&quot; said Lefurgey. &quot;There&#x27;s been an accumulation of things over time and we&#x27;re in a perfect storm for separatists right now, with all the things going on – everything from immigration, gun control, equalization.&quot;

The Alberta Independence Party never achieved party status when it ran candidates in 2001 election. The AIP is experiencing a revival and strives to run candidates in the 2019 provincial election and form party status. The Separation Party of Alberta, which nominated candidates in the 2004 provincial election, promoted the cause of separation in the province but renamed itself the Alberta First Party in 2013.

In July 2018, MLA Derek Fildebrandt became leader of the party, which rebranded itself as the Freedom Conservative Party of Alberta. As a result, separatism has been removed from the platform, and instead adopting Albertan autonomism as part of the party&#x27;s transformation. Lefurgey remains listed as President of the party by Elections Alberta.

The SPA issued a statement of support when the WIP of Saskatchewan was formed in 2003.

==WIP of Saskatchewan==
The Saskatchewan branch of the party nominated candidates in the 2003 provincial election, and the 2007 provincial election, but none were elected. It continues to be an active party under the leadership of Dana Arnason, but does not intend to nominate candidates in federal elections.

==Party program==

Party policy was adopted at the founding convention and was expanded at a policy convention in Saskatoon in April 1988.

The party&#x27;s basic policy statements were the following:
# independence as the only way Westerners could get political and economic justice;
# the constitutional right to private property;
# the citizen&#x27;s right to a referendum on major issues including the constitution and constitutional amendments;
# English as the official language; and
# an elected, equal and effective Senate.

===The party&#x27;s vision of an independent Western Canada===
# A prosperous low tax economy.
# Direct democracy.
# Separation of executive powers to end Prime Ministerial dictatorship.
# An elected accountable judiciary.
# Equality of treatment and opportunity for all people.
# An elected senate balancing popular representation with regional representation.
# English as the official language.
# A world-class medical system.
# A justice system that stresses accountability.
# No gun registry.
# No Kyoto Accord.
# Property rights guaranteed in the constitution.

<doc id="604238" wikidata="Q1172237" url="?curid=604238" title="Data Protection Act 1998">
<text>The Data Protection Act 1998 (c. 29) (DPA) was an act of Parliament of the United Kingdom designed to protect personal data stored on computers or in an organised paper filing system. It enacted provisions from the European Union (EU) Data Protection Directive 1995 on the protection, processing, and movement of data.

Under the 1998 DPA, individuals had legal rights to control information about themselves. Most of the Act did not apply to domestic use, such as keeping a personal address book. Anyone holding personal data for other purposes was legally obliged to comply with this Act, subject to some exemptions. The Act defined eight data protection principles to ensure that information was processed lawfully.

It was superseded by the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) on 23 May 2018. The DPA 2018 supplements the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on 25 May 2018. The GDPR regulates the collection, storage, and use of personal data significantly more strictly.

==Background==
The 1998 act replaced the &#x27; (c. 35) and the &#x27; (c. 37). Additionally, the 1998 act implemented the EU Data Protection Directive 1995.

The Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 altered the consent requirement for most electronic marketing to &quot;positive consent&quot; such as an opt-in box. Exemptions remain for the marketing of &quot;similar products and services&quot; to existing customers and enquirers, which can still be permitted on an opt-out basis.

The Jersey data protection law, the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2005 was modelled on the United Kingdom&#x27;s law.

==Contents==
===Scope of protection===
Section 1 of DPA 1998 defined &quot;personal data&quot; as any data that could have been used to identify a living individual. Anonymised or aggregated data was less regulated by the Act, provided the anonymisation or aggregation had not been done reversibly. Individuals could have been identified by various means including name and address, telephone number, or email address. The Act applied only to data which was held, or was intended to be held, on computers (&quot;equipment operating automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose&quot;), or held in a &quot;relevant filing system&quot;.

In some cases, paper records could have been classified as a relevant filing system, such as an address book or a salesperson&#x27;s diary used to support commercial activities.

The Freedom of Information Act 2000 modified the act for public bodies and authorities, and the &quot;Durant&quot; case modified the interpretation of the act by providing case law and precedent.

A person who had their data processed had the following rights:
*under section 7, to view the data on them held by an organisation for a reasonable fee: the maximum fee was £2 for requests to credit reference agencies, £50 for health and educational request, and £10 per individual otherwise,
*under section 14, to request that incorrect information be corrected. If the company ignored the request, a court could have ordered the data to be corrected or destroyed, and in some cases compensation could have been awarded.
*under section 10, to require that their data was not used in any way that potentially could have caused damage or distress.
*under section 11, to require that their data was not used for direct marketing.

===Data protection principles===
Schedule 1 listed eight &quot;data protection principles&quot;:
# Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be processed unless:
## at least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and
## in the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 is also met.
# Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.
# Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.
# Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
# Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
# About the rights of individuals e.g. personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects (individuals).
# Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.
# Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.

Broadly speaking, these eight principles were similar to the six principles set out in the GDPR of 2016.

;Conditions relevant to the first principle
Personal data should only be processed fairly and lawfully. In order for data to be classed as &#x27;fairly processed&#x27;, at least one of these six conditions had to be applicable to that data (Schedule 2).
# The data subject (the person whose data is stored) has consented (&quot;given their permission&quot;) to the processing;
# Processing is necessary for the performance of, or commencing, a contract;
# Processing is required under a legal obligation (other than one stated in the contract);
# Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject;
# Processing is necessary to carry out any public functions;
# Processing is necessary in order to pursue the legitimate interests of the &quot;data controller&quot; or &quot;third parties&quot; (unless it could unjustifiably prejudice the interests of the data subject).

;Consent
Except under the exceptions mentioned below, the individual had to consent to the collection of their personal information and its use in the purpose(s) in question. The European Data Protection Directive defined consent as “…any freely given specific and informed indication of his wishes by which the data subject signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed&quot;, meaning the individual could have &quot;signified&quot; agreement other than in writing. However, non-communication should not have been interpreted as consent.

Additionally, consent should have been appropriate to the age and capacity of the individual and other circumstances of the case. If an organisation &quot;intends to continue to hold or use personal data after the relationship with the individual ends, then the consent should cover this.&quot; When consent was given, it was not assumed to last forever, though in most cases, consent lasted for as long as the personal data needed to be processed, and individuals may have been able to withdraw their consent, depending on the nature of the consent and the circumstances in which the personal information was collected and used.

The Data Protection Act also specified that sensitive personal data must have been processed according to a stricter set of conditions, in particular, any consent must have been explicit.

===Exceptions===
The Act was structured such that all processing of personal data was covered by the act while providing a number of exceptions in Part IV. Notable exceptions were:
* Section 28 – National security. Any processing for the purpose of safeguarding national security is exempt from all the data protection principles, as well as Part II (subject access rights), Part III (notification), Part V (enforcement), and Section 55 (Unlawful obtaining of personal data).
* Section 29 – Crime and taxation. Data processed for the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders, or the assessment or collection of taxes are exempt from the first data protection principle.
* Section 36 – Domestic purposes. Processing by an individual only for the purposes of that individual&#x27;s personal, family or household affairs is exempt from all the data protection principles, as well as Part II (subject access rights) and Part III (notification).

===Police and court powers===
The Act granted or acknowledged various police and court powers.
* Section 29 – Consent of the data subject was not required when processing personal data to prevent or detect crime, apprehend or prosecute offenders, the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and discharge a statutory function.
* Section 35 – Disclosures required by law or made in connection with legal proceedings. This included obeying court orders and other laws, and were part of legal proceedings.

===Offences===
The Act detailed a number of civil and criminal offences for which data controllers may have been liable if a data controller failed to gain appropriate consent from a data subject. However, consent was not specifically defined in the Act and so was a common law matter.
* Section 21(1) made it an offence to process personal information without registration.
* Section 21(2) made it an offence to fail to comply with the notification regulations made by the Secretary of State (proposed by the Information Commissioner under section 25 of the Act).
* Section 55 made the acquisition of personal data unlawful, and made the acquisition of unauthorised access to personal data an offence for people (other parties), such as hackers and impersonators, outside the organisation.
* Section 56 made it a criminal offence to require an individual to make a Subject Access Request relating to cautions or convictions for the purposes of recruitment, continued employment, or the provision of services. This section was enforced on 10 March 2015.

===Complexity===
The UK Data Protection Act was a large Act that had a reputation for complexity. While the basic principles were honored for protecting privacy, interpreting the act was not always simple. Many companies, organisations, and individuals seemed very unsure of the aims, content, and principles of the Act. Some refused to provide even very basic, publicly available material, quoting the Act as a restriction. The Act also impacted the way in which organisations conducted business in terms of who should have been contacted for marketing purposes, not only by telephone and direct mail, but also electronically. This has led to the development of permission-based marketing strategies.

===Definition of personal data===
The definition of personal data was data relating to a living individual who can be identified
* from that data; or
* from that data plus other information that was in the possession, or likely to come into the possession, of the data controller.

Sensitive personal data concerned the subject&#x27;s race, ethnicity, politics, religion, trade union status, health, sexual history, or criminal record.

===Subject access requests===
The Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office website stated regarding subject access requests: &quot;You have the right to find out if an organisation is using or storing your personal data. This is called the right of access. You exercise this right by asking for a copy of the data, which is commonly known as making a &#x27;subject access request.&#x27;&quot;

Before the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on 25 May 2018, organisations could have charged a specified fee for responding to a SAR of up to £10 for most requests. Following GDPR: &quot;A copy of your personal data should be provided free. An organisation may charge for additional copies. It can only charge a fee if it thinks the request is &#x27;manifestly unfounded or excessive&#x27;. If so, it may ask for a reasonable fee for administrative costs associated with the request.&quot;

===Information Commissioner===

Compliance with the Act was regulated and enforced by an independent authority, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office, which maintained guidance relating to the Act.

=== EU’s Article 29 Working Party ===
In January 2017, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office invited public comments on the EU&#x27;s Article 29 Working Party&#x27;s proposed changes to data protection law and the anticipated introduction of extensions to the interpretation of the Act, the Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation.

<doc id="604244" wikidata="Q36301" url="?curid=604244" title="Anne Hathaway">
<text>Anne Jacqueline Hathaway (born November 12, 1982) is an American actress. Her accolades include an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award. Her films have grossed over $6.8 billion worldwide, and she appeared on the &quot;Forbes&quot; Celebrity 100 list in 2009. She was among the world&#x27;s highest-paid actresses in 2015.

Hathaway performed in several plays in high school. As a teenager, she was cast in the television series &quot;Get Real&quot; (1999–2000) and made her breakthrough by playing the lead role in the Disney comedy &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; (2001). After starring in a string of family films, including &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; (2004), Hathaway made a transition to mature roles with the 2005 drama &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;. The comedy-drama &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (2006), in which she played an assistant to a fashion magazine editor, was her biggest commercial success to that point. She played a recovering addict in the drama &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot; (2008), which earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

Hathaway had further commercial success in the comedy &quot;Get Smart&quot; (2008), the romances &quot;Bride Wars&quot; (2009), &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010), and &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot; (2010), and the fantasy film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010). In 2012, she starred as Catwoman in her highest-grossing film, &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, and played Fantine, a prostitute dying of tuberculosis, in the musical &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the latter. She has since played a scientist in the science fiction film &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014), the owner of a fashion website in the comedy &quot;The Intern&quot; (2015), a haughty actress in the heist film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot; (2018), a con artist in the comedy &quot;The Hustle&quot; (2019), Rebekah Neumann in the miniseries &quot;WeCrashed&quot; (2022), and an older woman dating a young pop star in the romantic comedy &quot;The Idea of You&quot; (2024).

Hathaway has won a Primetime Emmy Award for her voice role in the sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, sung for soundtracks, appeared on stage, and hosted events. She supports several charitable causes. She is a board member of the Lollipop Theatre Network, an organization that brings films to children in hospitals, and advocates for gender equality as a UN Women goodwill ambassador.

==Early life and background==
Anne Jacqueline &quot;Annie&quot; Hathaway was born on November 12, 1982, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. Her father, Gerald, was a labor attorney, and her mother, Kate (née McCauley), is a former actress. Hathaway&#x27;s maternal grandfather was WIP (AM) Philadelphia radio personality Joe McCauley. According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, she was named after Shakespeare&#x27;s wife. She has an older brother, Michael, and a younger brother, Thomas. When Hathaway was six, the family moved to Millburn, New Jersey, where she was raised.

At age eight, when Hathaway watched her mother perform in the first national tour of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; as Fantine, she instantly became fascinated with the stage, but her parents were not keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career. After this, Kate quit acting to raise Hathaway and her brothers. Hathaway was raised as Roman Catholic with what she considers to be &quot;really strong values&quot; and wished to be a nun during her childhood, but acting was always a high priority for her. Her relationship with the Catholic Church changed at age fifteen, after learning that her older brother was gay. Her family left the church, joining the Episcopal Church because of its acceptance of homosexuality, but they eventually left that too. In 2009, Hathaway described her religious beliefs as &quot;a work in progress&quot;.

Hathaway attended Brooklyn Heights Montessori School and Wyoming Elementary School in Millburn. She graduated from Millburn High School, where she played soccer and took part in many plays, including &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;, in which she portrayed Winnifred. Later, she appeared in the plays &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and &quot;Gigi&quot;, at New Jersey&#x27;s Paper Mill Playhouse. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1993 and became the first teenager admitted into the Barrow Group Theater Company&#x27;s acting program. She spent several semesters studying as an English major and political science minor at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, before transferring to New York University&#x27;s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.

Between 1998 and 1999, Hathaway sang soprano with the All-Eastern U.S. High School Honors Chorus at Carnegie Hall and in plays at Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey. Early in her film career, her acting style and appearance would be likened to Judy Garland—whom she cites as one of her favorite actresses—and Audrey Hepburn. Three days after her performance at Carnegie Hall, Hathaway was cast in the short-lived Fox television series &quot;Get Real&quot;. She played the teenager Meghan Green, alongside Jon Tenney, Debrah Farentino and Jesse Eisenberg. Despite her early success, Hathaway suffered from depression and anxiety as a teenager. However, she said in 2008 that she had since grown from it. She missed her first college semester for the filming of her cinematic debut, &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; (2001). According to Hathaway, she never regretted not completing her degree, as she enjoyed being with others who &quot;were trying to grow up&quot;.

==Career==
===2001–2004: Early roles and breakthrough===
In 2001, Hathaway starred in the Disney comedy &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, based on Meg Cabot&#x27;s novel of the same name. Hathaway portrayed teenager Mia Thermopolis, who discovers that she is the heiress to the throne of the fictional Kingdom of Genovia. Hathaway auditioned for the role during a flight layover on the way to New Zealand. Director Garry Marshall initially considered Liv Tyler for the role, but cast Hathaway after his granddaughters suggested that she had the best &quot;princess&quot; hair. The film became a major commercial success, grossing $165 million worldwide. Many critics lauded Hathaway&#x27;s performance; a BBC critic noted that &quot;Hathaway shines in the title role and generates great chemistry&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Elvis Mitchell found her to be &quot;royalty in the making, a young comic talent with a scramble of features&quot;. She earned an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female Performance nomination for the role. The same year, Hathaway starred with Christopher Gorham in Mitch Davis&#x27;s &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot;, which was also distributed by Disney. Inspired by John H. Groberg&#x27;s memoir &quot;In the Eye of the Storm&quot;, the film met with mostly negative reviews and was a box-office failure.

Owing to the success of &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, &quot;People&quot; magazine named Hathaway one of its breakthrough stars of 2001. In February 2002, Hathaway starred in the City Center Encores! concert production of &quot;Carnival!&quot; in her New York City stage debut; she was cast as Lili, an optimistic orphan who falls in love with a magician. Before rehearsing with the full cast, Hathaway trained with a vocal coach for two weeks. She memorized almost all her lines and songs at the first read-through. Critics generally praised her for holding her own against well-known actors and heralded her as a new star. In a positive review of the musical, Charles Isherwood of &quot;Variety&quot; called Hathaway the highlight of the show and &quot;remarkably unaffected and winning&quot;, praising her convincing performance. She won a Clarence Derwent Award for Most Promising Female. Later, Hathaway voiced the audiobook release of the first three books in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; novels.

Hathaway portrayed princesses and appeared in family-oriented films over the next three years, subsequently becoming known in mainstream media as a children&#x27;s role model. After voicing Haru Yoshioka for the English version of &quot;The Cat Returns&quot; (2002), she starred in Douglas McGrath&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (2002), which opened to positive reviews. However, the film did not enter wide release and failed at the North American box office, totaling less than $4 million in ticket sales. The fantasy romantic comedy &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; (2004), in which Hathaway played the titular character, also performed poorly at the box office. She had first read the book on which the film is based when she was 16, and stated that the script was originally much closer to the source material but did not work as a film, and therefore preferred the picture the way it turned out. It opened to mostly mixed reviews. Hathaway sang three songs on the film&#x27;s soundtrack, including a duet with singer Jesse McCartney.

In 2003, Hathaway turned down the role of Christine Daaé for Joel Schumacher&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (2004), because the production schedule of the film overlapped with &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; (2004). She was initially hesitant and nervous about starring in the sequel, but agreed to it after Marshall convinced her that she was not repeating anything. The film was released in August 2004 to negative reviews, but made $95.1 million against a $40 million budget.

===2005–2008: Transition to adult roles and critical recognition===
Hathaway began taking on adult roles to avoid typecasting, remarking that &quot;anybody who was a role model for children needs a reprieve&quot;, but noted that &quot;it&#x27;s lovely to think that my audience is growing up with me&quot;. After replacing Tara Strong for the voice role of Red Puckett in &quot;Hoodwinked!&quot;, she starred in the drama &quot;Havoc&quot; (2005) as a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. While the film was thematically different from her previous releases, Hathaway denied that her role was an attempt to be seen as a more mature actress, citing her belief that performing nudity in certain films is merely a part of what her chosen form of art demands of her; because of this belief she does not consider appearing nude in appropriate films to be morally objectionable. The film was not released in theaters in the United States due to unfavorable critical reception.

In the 2005 drama &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot;, which depicts the emotional and sexual relationship between two men married to women, Ennis Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), Hathaway played Lureen, the wife of Jack. The actress was originally sent the script with the part of Ennis&#x27; wife in mind, but decided to audition for Lureen instead after she read it. She lied during the audition about her knowledge of riding so that the director Ang Lee would cast her, but did subsequently take lessons. The film received critical acclaim and several Academy Award nominations. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that Hathaway &quot;excels at showing Lureen&#x27;s journey from cutie-pie to hard case&quot;, and Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; credited her for &quot;provid[ing] an entertaining contrast in wifely disappointment&quot;. Hathaway stated that the content of &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; was more important than its award count, and that making the film made her more aware of the kind of stories she wanted to tell as an actor. At this point, she realized that she wanted to play roles to move audiences or otherwise entertain them so much that they forget about their own lives.

Hathaway starred in the comedy-drama &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (2006), based on Lauren Weisberger&#x27;s novel of the same name, as a college graduate who becomes an assistant to a powerful fashion magazine editor (played by Meryl Streep). She was &quot;the ninth choice&quot; for the part, citing this later as an inspiration for people to never give up, and in preparation she volunteered for a few weeks as an assistant at an auction house. She also followed a weight-loss regimen, along with co-star Emily Blunt, which made them hungry and led to crying. Hathaway stated that working on the film made her respect the fashion industry a great deal more than she did previously, though she admitted that her personal style was something she &quot;still can&#x27;t get right&quot;. &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; received positive reviews; Roger Ebert called Hathaway &quot;a great beauty [...] who makes a convincing career girl&quot; and Rotten Tomatoes found &quot;Streep in top form and Anne Hathaway more than holding her own&quot;. It proved to be her most widely seen film to that point, with a worldwide gross of over $326.5 million.

Originally cast in &quot;Knocked Up&quot;, Hathaway dropped out before production and was replaced with Katherine Heigl. This happened because, according to writer-director Judd Apatow, the actress was uncomfortable with the use of real footage of a woman in labor; she believed it did not contribute to the film&#x27;s story. Her sole release in 2007 was the biographical romantic drama &quot;Becoming Jane&quot;, as the titular English author Jane Austen. A fan of Austen since age 14, Hathaway prepared for the role by rereading Austen&#x27;s books and conducting historical research, such as perusing the author&#x27;s letters; she also learned sign language, calligraphy, dance choreography, and the piano. She moved to England a month before filming to improve her English accent. She received a British Independent Film Award for Best Actress nomination for the film, although some critics negatively focused on her accent and performance.

In October 2008, Hathaway hosted an episode of the NBC late-night sketch comedy &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. She also starred in Peter Segal&#x27;s film adaptation of Mel Brooks&#x27; television series &quot;Get Smart,&quot; in which she played Agent 99. Calling the role &quot;a childhood dream come true&quot;, Hathaway learned martial arts and dancing techniques in preparation. While filming an action sequence, she split the flesh of her shin to the bone, which led to her receiving 15 stitches. The film, centering on an analyst who dreams of becoming a real field agent and a better spy, was a financial success. Hathaway&#x27;s two other releases of 2008 were the drama &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot; and the mystery thriller &quot;Passengers&quot;, the latter of which was a critical and commercial failure. In Jonathan Demme&#x27;s &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot;, she starred as a young woman who, after being released from drug rehabilitation, returns home for her sister&#x27;s wedding. Portraying a character she described as &quot;narcissistic—downright selfish,&quot; Hathaway garnered critical acclaim for her performance. Peter Travers found her to be &quot;raw and riveting&quot; in the role, adding that she &quot;acts the hell out of it, achieving a state of sorrowful grace&quot;. She received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress.

===2009–2011: Romantic comedies and hosting events===
Hathaway starred in &quot;Bride Wars&quot; (2009), which she described as &quot;hideously commercial—gloriously so&quot;. The romantic comedy, in which she and Kate Hudson played two best friends who become rivals after their weddings are scheduled on the same day, was a critical failure; it was named among the ten worst chick flicks in history by &quot;Time&quot; in 2010. Despite this, the film was successful financially and earned Hathaway an MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance nomination. She played the heroine Viola in a summer 2009 production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the Delacorte Theater in New York City. Charles Isherwood opined that Hathaway &quot;dives smoothly and with obvious pleasure into the embrace of a cohesive ensemble cast&quot;. For her portrayal of the role, she garnered a nomination for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play. In 2010, she also won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for providing her voice for the episode &quot;Once Upon a Time in Springfield&quot; in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Hathaway voiced different characters in &quot;Family Guy&quot; in 2010 and 2011.

In 2010, Hathaway appeared as a receptionist who dates a clerk (played by Topher Grace) in the ensemble romantic comedy &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, directed by Garry Marshall. The film was a commercial success, grossing more than $215 million worldwide against a budget of $52 million. Hathaway played the White Queen in Tim Burton&#x27;s 2010 adaptation of the fantasy novels &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; alongside Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp. She summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of Happy Bunny holding a knife; &quot;Cute but psycho. Things even out.&quot; Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as &quot;a punk-rock vegan pacifist&quot;, drawing inspiration from Debbie Harry and the artwork of Dan Flavin. &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film&#x27;s visuals but criticized the lack of narrative coherence. Commercially, it grossed $1 billion to become the second-highest-grossing film of 2010.

Hathaway reunited with Jake Gyllenhaal as a free-spirited artist with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in Edward Zwick&#x27;s erotic romantic comedy-drama &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot;, based on the nonfiction book &quot;Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman&quot; by Jamie Reidy. For the role, she spent time with a Parkinson&#x27;s patient to research the disease, and in preparation for its nude scenes, she watched films of Kate Winslet and Penélope Cruz who, in Hathaway&#x27;s view, had performed nudity with sensitivity and dignity. She believed these scenes would not discourage socially conservative people from watching the film. Critics generally praised the film&#x27;s adult romance, but were unenthusiastic about its plot elements. Hathaway&#x27;s performance, which Ebert called &quot;warm, lovable&quot;, earned her a Satellite Award and a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Comedy or Musical. Together with actor Denzel Washington, Hathaway hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway in December 2010. Two months later, she and James Franco hosted the 83rd Academy Awards. Critics were unenthusiastic about their chemistry, but thought Hathaway gave her best and did a better job than Franco, who they felt seemed uninterested. At the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, she garnered an Outstanding Variety Special (Live) nomination.

In 2011, Hathaway voiced Jewel, a female Spix&#x27;s macaw from Rio de Janeiro, in the animated film &quot;Rio&quot;, produced by 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios. It received generally positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music. A commercial success, it grossed more than $484 million worldwide against a budget of $90 million. Later, Hathaway starred alongside Jim Sturgess in Lone Scherfig&#x27;s &quot;One Day&quot;, based on David Nicholls&#x27; novel of the same name. The film tells the story of two young people who meet annually for twenty years after they shared a platonic one-night stand together. Hathaway was clandestinely given the script, as &quot;One Day&quot; was set in Britain, and Scherfig was not looking for any American actresses for the part. After a nonproductive meeting with Scherfig, Hathaway left a list of songs for the director, who after listening to them, cast the actress for the part. Hathaway later expressed regret that she might have unwittingly held misogyny during production, as she came to feel that she had not trusted Scherfig as a director because of her gender. Her Yorkshire accent in the film was considered subpar. Columnist Suzanne Moore, reviewing the film on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Front Row&quot;, said Hathaway&#x27;s accents were &quot;all over the shop&quot;, adding, &quot;Sometimes she&#x27;s from Scotland, sometimes she&#x27;s from New York, you just can&#x27;t tell&quot;. The film itself received polarizing reviews from critics, but became a moderate box office success.

===2012–2014: &quot;Les Misérables&quot; and films with Christopher Nolan===
In 2012, Hathaway&#x27;s audiobook recording of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s 1900 novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; was released at Audible.com and garnered her an Audie Award nomination for Best Solo Narration – Female. She then played the sly, morally ambiguous cat burglar Selina Kyle / Catwoman in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, the final installment in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy. Hathaway auditioned not knowing what part she was being considered for, admitting that she had Harley Quinn in mind but only learned her role after talking with Nolan for an hour. She described it as her most physically demanding assignment to that point, as she had to redouble her efforts in the gym to keep up with the requirements of the role. She trained extensively in martial arts, and looked to Hedy Lamarr in developing her performance as Catwoman. &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; was critically successful and grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2012. &quot;IGN&quot; reviewer Jim Vejvoda labeled Hathaway &quot;a magnetic presence whenever she&#x27;s onscreen&quot; and added, &quot;Selina may be the proverbial good bad girl, the thief with a heart of gold, but Hathaway imbues her with a wounded spirit and a survivor&#x27;s edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic even when she&#x27;s being naughty.&quot; She won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.

Hathaway portrayed Fantine, a prostitute dying of tuberculosis, in Tom Hooper&#x27;s &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, an adaptation of the stage musical of the same name. Footage of the actress singing &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot;, a song from the film, was shown at the 2012 CinemaCon, where Hooper described her singing as &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;real&quot;. In preparation for the role, Hathaway consumed fewer than 500 calories a day to lose , researched prostitution, and cut her hair. To adopt her character&#x27;s mental space alone during production in London, she sent her husband back to the United States; this resulted in her becoming increasingly temperamental. Ann Hornaday of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; asserted that &quot;the centerpiece of a movie composed entirely of centerpieces belongs to Anne Hathaway, who as the tragic heroine Fantine sings another of the memorable numbers&quot;. She won the Academy Award, Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. Asked if she was pleased with her performance in the film, Hathaway expressed doubts, replying with &quot;Eh&quot;. In January 2013, Hathaway&#x27;s rendition of &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot; reached number 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

After briefly appearing in the romantic comedy &quot;Don Jon&quot; (2013), Hathaway starred in and co-produced (with her husband and others) &quot;Song One&quot;. In the drama film, she played an anthropology student who returns home to see her injured brother, Henry (played by Ben Rosenfield), and soon begins a romantic relationship with his favorite musician, James Forester (played by Johnny Flynn). Her character was originally written as a 19-year-old, but Kate Barker-Froyland, the film&#x27;s writer and director, changed the part to that of an older woman after casting Hathaway. The actress said the reason she decided to produce the film was because of its depiction of the healing power of music and second chances. For the film&#x27;s soundtrack, she provided her voice for the song &quot;Afraid of Heights&quot;. &quot;Song One&quot; premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the 30th Sundance Film Festival in January 2014, and released in theaters the following year to mixed reviews from critics. Commercially, the film failed to recoup its $6 million investment.

Hathaway reprised her role as Jewel in the animated film &quot;Rio 2&quot;—her third film with Jamie Foxx—which was released in 2014. It grossed nearly five times more than its $103 million budget. Her sole live-action release of 2014 was Christopher Nolan&#x27;s epic science fiction film &quot;Interstellar&quot;. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, it follows a crew of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for mankind. Hathaway was drawn to the part of NASA scientist Amelia Brand due to the character&#x27;s growth from an arrogant to a humbler person. With a budget of $165 million, the high-profile production co-starring Matthew McConaughey was filmed mostly using IMAX cameras. Hathaway nearly experienced hypothermia while filming a water scene in Iceland, as the dry suit she was wearing had not been properly secured. Reviewers for &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; found her to be &quot;affecting&quot; in the part of a scientist unable to decide between her personal feelings and professional responsibilities, and took notice of the &quot;soulful nuance&quot; in her performance. &quot;Interstellar&quot; grossed over $701 million worldwide, and earned Hathaway a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actress.

===2015–2021: Comedic roles and career fluctuations===
Hathaway began 2015 with an appearance in the first season of the musical reality show &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;. In the episode, she competed against her &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; co-star Emily Blunt; she lip synced &quot;Love&quot; by Mary J. Blige and &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; by Miley Cyrus. Nancy Meyers&#x27; &quot;The Intern&quot; was Hathaway&#x27;s sole film release of 2015. It tells the story of Ben Whittaker (played by Robert De Niro), a 70-year-old widower who becomes a senior intern at an online fashion site run by Jules Ostin (Hathaway). She had aspired to work with De Niro and Meyers, her favorite actor and director, respectively; impressed with the film&#x27;s story, she auditioned for the third time for a Meyers film. Reviews of the film were generally positive; one in Roger Ebert&#x27;s website found her to be &quot;extremely appealing&quot; and a reviewer for &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;&quot;The Intern&quot; gets off on De Niro&#x27;s amiability and Hathaway&#x27;s sweet energy&quot;. The film grossed $194 million worldwide against a $35 million budget. The 2015 found footage horror film &quot;Be My Cat: A Film for Anne&quot;, about an aspiring Romanian filmmaker who goes to shocking extremes to convince Hathaway to star in his film, was officially selected and had its North American premiere at the 2016 Nashville Film Festival.

Hathaway reprised the role of the White Queen in &quot;Alice Through the Looking Glass&quot;, the 2016 sequel to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. That March, it was reported that she would reprise her role for &quot;The Princess Diaries 3&quot;; the project was shelved after the death of Garry Marshall, who was set to direct the film. Hathaway is one of several actors featured on Barbra Streisand&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;&quot;. Along with Daisy Ridley, Hathaway and Streisand performed the song &quot;At The Ballet&quot; from &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;; she played the role of Maggie, one of a trio of dancers hoping to be cast in an upcoming show. Her final film that year was alongside Jason Sudeikis in Nacho Vigalondo&#x27;s science fiction black comedy &quot;Colossal&quot; (2016). Playing an unemployed young writer, Hathaway was the first actress to sign on at a time when the project had no financial backing. She was drawn to the genre-hopping nature of the script, later comparing it to &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; (1999), one of her favorite films. The film received positive reviews from critics, but earned only $4 million at the box office.

After a two-year absence from the screen, Hathaway starred as a famous actress in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot;, an all-female spin-off of the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; franchise from director Gary Ross. Co-starring Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett, it follows a group of criminals who plan to rob the Met Gala. Hathaway was drawn to the idea of playing someone with an immense ego and saw the part as an opportunity &quot;to lean into all the ridiculous fame nonsense that I&#x27;ve been trying to side-step for all of these years.&quot; She hoped the film would be profitable so that it could debunk claims that female-led films do not succeed commercially. Critics generally considered Hathaway to be a scene-stealer among the cast, with ABC Online&#x27;s Jason Di Rosso writing, &quot;The film&#x27;s best moments belong to Hathaway as the anxiety-ridden, vain and capricious starlet. She&#x27;s the only successful meld of comedy and pathos—a victim of the celebrity treadmill who is also capable of outsmarting it.&quot; &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot; was a box office success, grossing over $297 million worldwide against a $70 million budget.

Hathaway&#x27;s first two films of 2019—the thriller &quot;Serenity&quot; and the comedy &quot;The Hustle&quot;—were poorly received by critics. In the former, she starred alongside her &quot;Interstellar&quot; costar Matthew McConaughey as a woman who tasks her ex-husband to kill her new abusive husband, a role for which she dyed her hair blonde. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; dismissed her performance as &quot;cartoonish&quot;, adding that her femme fatale character was reminiscent of &quot;a kind of live-action Jessica Rabbit&quot;. The latter film was a remake of the 1988 film &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;, co-starring Rebel Wilson, which emerged as a sleeper hit. Hathaway next played a woman with bipolar disorder in an episode of the Amazon Prime Video romantic anthology series &quot;Modern Love&quot;. She then played the wife of Mark Ruffalo&#x27;s character in Todd Haynes&#x27; legal drama &quot;Dark Waters&quot;, about environmental poisoning committed by the chemical company DuPont. Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Owen Gleiberman termed her supporting performance &quot;a piercing dance of agony and loyalty&quot;.

Hathaway began the new decade with the political thriller &quot;The Last Thing He Wanted&quot; (2020), based on the book of the same name by Joan Didion. She considered herself to be an unlikely choice for the part of a headstrong journalist, as it differed from her own &quot;puppy dog&quot; personality. It received negative reviews from critics. She then starred in &quot;The Witches&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name from director Robert Zemeckis, in which she played an evil witch. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who deemed it inferior to the 1990 adaptation. Hathaway&#x27;s performances in both films earned her nominations for Worst Actress at the 41st Golden Raspberry Awards. In 2021, she starred in the heist film &quot;Locked Down&quot;, directed by Doug Liman, which premiered on HBO Max. Set during the COVID-19 pandemic, it co-starred Chiwetel Ejiofor. The film was shot over the course of 18 days with limited resources. She next took on a role in one episode of the Amazon Prime Video anthology series &quot;Solos&quot;.

===2022–present: Critical resurgence===
Hathaway executive produced and starred opposite Jared Leto in the Apple TV+ miniseries &quot;WeCrashed&quot;, about the company WeWork. It received favorable reviews, with particular praise for Hathaway&#x27;s portrayal of Rebekah Neumann. Angie Han of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commended her for resisting &quot;the temptation to turn Rebekah into an exaggerated caricature of an entitled woo-woo type, which ultimately only makes Rebekah funnier&quot;. Hathaway starred in James Gray&#x27;s semi-autobiographical period drama &quot;Armageddon Time&quot;, portraying a character inspired by Gray&#x27;s mother. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; considered it her best performance since &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot;, while Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; praised Hathaway for making her character &quot;at once affectionate and blinkered&quot;.

In her two film releases of 2023—&quot;Eileen&quot; and &quot;She Came to Me&quot;—Hathaway played emotionally troubled psychiatrists. &quot;Eileen&quot;, based on Ottessa Moshfegh&#x27;s thriller novel of the same name, starred Thomasin McKenzie in the title role and premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. Hathaway described the project as &quot;&quot;Carol&quot; meets &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;&quot;. Terming the film a &quot;perverse folie à deux&quot;, Ryan Lattanzio of IndieWire believed that &quot;Hathaway has never been better in a role that feels [...] tailor-made for her&quot;. At that year&#x27;s Berlin International Film Festival, Rebecca Miller&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;She Came to Me&quot;, was released.

Hathaway&#x27;s first release of 2024 was as a grieving mother coping with the loss of her son in the thriller &quot;Mothers&#x27; Instinct&quot;. A remake of the 2018 Belgian film, she co-starred with Jessica Chastain. Hathaway created a &quot;protective layer&quot; between herself and her character, requesting for cast and crew members to refer to her by her character&#x27;s name as she deemed the loss of a child her &quot;worst fear&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw thought that her performance was overshadowed by that of Chastain. She next led the romantic comedy &quot;The Idea of You&quot;, based on Robinne Lee&#x27;s novel of the same name, playing a divorced mother who begins a romance with a younger pop star. Alissa Wilkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; believed that the film &quot;succeeds mostly because of Hathaway&#x27;s performance&quot;, and praised her chemistry with co-star Nicholas Galitzine. 

As of March 2023, Hathaway will next star alongside Michaela Coel in David Lowery&#x27;s &quot;Mother Mary&quot; and will lead David Robert Mitchell&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Flowervale Street&quot;. She will also reunite with Christopher Nolan on &quot;The Odyssey&quot; (2026).

==Public image==
Describing her off-screen persona, John Hiscock of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote in 2014 that Hathaway is a &quot;well-grounded, friendly young woman with a good sense of humour, a wide smile and an easy-going attitude&quot;. Hiscock further opines that, despite considerable success, she has never &quot;gone Hollywood&quot;, remaining close with her friends. The authors of the book &quot;365 Style&quot; noted Hathaway&#x27;s girl next door image, and her &quot;The Intern&quot; director Nancy Meyers says she is &quot;wise beyond her years&quot;. The journalist Laura Brown found her to be a &quot;sincere&quot;, &quot;warm and funny&quot; woman. After her 2013 awards acceptance speeches for &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; noted that several media commentators accused her of being &quot;annoying&quot; and making &quot;awkward&quot; jokes. Discussing this, Hathaway explained that she feels anxious when public speaking but has since grown from it and become a more compassionate person. She said regarding her perceived image: &quot;People have this idea of me as just being a very prim, professional girl, which I suppose I am, but I do cut loose and have fun in my life&quot;.

Remarking on her performance in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Charles Isherwood wrote, &quot;on screen or onstage Ms. Hathaway possesses the unmistakable glow of a natural star&quot;. An &quot;Esquire&quot; writer wrote in 2018 that many of her good performances had been overlooked, describing her career as &quot;subtle brilliance that has largely gone unnoticed&quot;. Discussing her career in 2015, Hathaway said that, after her breakthrough in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, she struggled to find roles that were serious - or were not about princesses. According to Judi Gugliemli of &quot;People&quot;, Hathaway used that fear of being typecast as motivation to build a versatile body of work. Gugliemli believed that her ability to extensively research her roles is the key to her success. A writer for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commended her willingness to appear in different genres, ranging from action comedies to dramas. Hathaway aspires to appear in many different films, work with different directors and play diverse roles. She said she would be &quot;lost&quot; without acting and feels lucky to have found it as her profession. A trained stage actress, she prefers performing on stage to film roles and claims to be terrified of acting on camera. &quot;I always assume that every film is my last, and I always assume that I have to go out and convince everybody why they have to hire me. I still audition,&quot; she said in 2015.

&quot;Forbes&quot; reported that Hathaway was one of the world&#x27;s highest-paid actresses in 2015, and since 2017, she has been among the highest-grossing actresses of the 21st century. In 2009, she was included on &quot;Forbes&quot;″ annual Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $7 million, and was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. , her films had grossed $6.7 billion worldwide. Profiled as among the world&#x27;s leading actresses by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Hathaway, according to Catherine Elsworth of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, is pursued both by directors and by cosmetics companies. In January 2008, she joined French luxury perfumes and cosmetics house Lancôme as the face of their fragrance &quot;Magnifique&quot;. In 2011, she became the new face of the Italian company Tod&#x27;s.

Hathaway&#x27;s beauty and sex appeal have been picked up by several media outlets; &quot;FHM&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; have included her on their yearly listings of sexiest women. In 2011, &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot; listed her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful Women in Film. Elsworth called her in 2008 &quot;the hottest young actress in Hollywood&quot;. Hathaway disagreed, insisting that she has a &quot;good girl&quot; image and no sex appeal. She has refused to undergo treatment with Botox, saying she is comfortable in her own skin.

==Activism==
Hathaway has served as a long-term advocate for the Nike Foundation to raise awareness against child marriage. In July 2006, she spent a week in Nicaragua to help vaccinate children against hepatitis A. She has also traveled to other countries to promote the rights of women and girls, including Kenya and Ethiopia. In 2008, she was honored at &quot;Elle&quot;″s Women in Hollywood tribute and won an award from the Human Rights Campaign for her philanthropy; she was also honored for her work with Step Up Women&#x27;s Network in 2008. She then teamed up in 2010 with World Bank in a two-year development program &quot;The Girl Effect&quot; whose mission focuses on helping empower girls in developing and developed nations where one-third of young women are not employed and not in school. In 2013, she provided the narration for &quot;Girl Rising&quot;, a CNN documentary film, which focused on the power of female education as it followed seven girls around the world who sought to overcome obstacles and follow their dreams.

Hathaway serves on the board of the Lollipop Theatre Network and is involved with charities Creative Coalition, St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital and the Human Rights Campaign. In 2016, Hathaway was appointed UN Women Goodwill ambassador based on her advocacy for gender equality.

To promote an increased awareness of systemic sexism in the entertainment industry, Hathaway has advocated for greater professional opportunities for women and criticized Hollywood as not being a place of equality. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time&#x27;s Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Hathaway began a romantic relationship with Italian real estate developer Raffaello Follieri. Follieri&#x27;s Manhattan-based foundation focused on efforts such as providing vaccinations for children in poor countries. In June 2008, it was investigated by the IRS for failure to file required nonprofit information forms. In June 2008, Follieri was arrested on charges of defrauding investors out of millions of dollars in a scheme in which he posed as the Vatican&#x27;s real-estate agent. The FBI confiscated Hathaway&#x27;s private journals from Follieri&#x27;s New York City apartment as part of their ongoing investigation into Follieri&#x27;s activities. Hathaway was not charged with any crime. In October 2008, after earlier pleading guilty, Follieri was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.

In early 2007, Hathaway spoke of her experiences with depression during her teens, saying that she eventually overcame the disorder without medication. In 2008, she began smoking after a stressful summer and the end of her relationship with Follieri. She has credited quitting smoking for the subsequent decline in her stress level and returned to being a vegetarian. Hathaway became a vegan in early 2012, but she quit in 2014.

<text>The greater siren (Siren lacertina) is an amphibian and one of the five members of the genus &quot;Siren&quot;. The largest of the sirens and one of the largest amphibians in North America, the greater siren resides in the coastal plains of the southeastern United States.

== Description ==
The greater siren is the third longest salamander in the Western Hemisphere. &quot;S. lacertina&quot; is paedomorphic, as are all sirens. They lack hindlimbs as well as a pelvic girdle, and have external gills all throughout their lives along with small lungs. They lack eyelids, and have an unfused pectoral girdle. Greater sirens measure around in length upon hatching and then grow to lengths ranging from . Weight can range from . Coloration varies throughout their range, but they are generally an olive or gray color with small yellow or green dots on their sides. They have about 36 to 40 costal grooves between their armpits and their cloaca. Younger sirens also have a light stripe along their sides, which fades with age. The front legs, each with four toes, are so small that they can be hidden in the gills. 

In terms of sensory organs, greater sirens rely on both a modified Jacobson&#x27;s organ and a lateral line system over their small eyes. It is possible that they are capable of sensing disturbances in electrical fields.

== Diet ==
 Greater sirens are carnivorous and prey upon invertebrates (such as insects, crustaceans, gastropods, bivalves, spiders, molluscs, and crayfish) and aquatic vertebrates (such as small fish) with a possible preference for molluscs (such as snails and freshwater clams), although they have been observed to eat vegetation such as algae. In addition, materials that are non-animal were found in their digestive tract added to amounts of 75% or greater. The oral morphology of the greater siren contribute little to the mastication of food and does not rupture or grind ingested invertebrates, algae, or plants requiring prior fermentation in the gut. 

== Ecology and behavior ==
Greater sirens play a crucial role in aquatic food webs and have been described as midlevel predators. Sirens swallow molluscs whole and will pass the shell as waste. They are nocturnal and spend the day in dense vegetation. Their lifespan in the wild is unknown, but in captivity they can live up to 25 years. Greater sirens can vocalize, producing clicks or yelps sounding similar to the call of the American green tree frog. They are able to aestivate for multiple years if necessary, burrowing into mud and exuding a cocoon of dead skin cells. This has been seen during times of drought and hydroperiod fluctuations and might last as long as three years in large individuals with high lipid content. Known predators include the American alligator and the mud snake. Other predators of this species are poorly documented. However, on June 19, 2008 a greater siren was consumed by a two-toed amphiuma, indicating that this species could be an additional predator of the greater siren.

== Breeding ==
Their spermatozoa possess a pair of flagella, and their courtship behavior is unknown. Mating occurs in February and March. After the eggs have been laid, the father will continuously fan its tail back and forth over or through the nest. The father will aggressively guard the nest from potential threats, including other sirens, and even the mother of the clutch. After 2 months, the eggs hatch, and the fathers depart from the nest. Youth live in shallower water than adults, often among the roots of water hyacinths.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Greater sirens inhabit the coastal plain from Washington, D.C., to Florida and Alabama. A population of sirens in the Rio Grande around Texas and Tamaulipas in Mexico was tentatively determined to be &quot;S. lacertina&quot;; however, recent studies have refuted this claim. Greater sirens live in wetlands, preferring those with a slow or nonexistent current and a thick layer of organic material. They are capable of inhabiting seasonal and permanent wetlands given their ability to aestivate, and will burrow into mud if their wetland dries up. They are predominately found in the deep benthic zone where aquatic insects are most abundant. Associated habitat for greater sirens includes vegetative ditches, and various other forms of slow, or stagnant bodies of water. Often during the day, they seek refuges from predators and are found under logs and various other structures.

==Interaction with humans==
=== Trapping techniques ===
&quot;S. lacertina&quot; is difficult to capture because of their preference for areas with thick vegetation. Standard methods such as dip-netting, seining, and dredges are ineffective in such habitats. The use of aquatic funnel traps, commercially produced to capture crayfish, has been found effective for use on Siren and Amphiuma species and there is no risk of drowning the animals. Each trap consists of the trap body, three funnels, and a neck with a lid at the top.

=== Conservation ===
Greater sirens are classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, although they have been extirpated from some of their former range due to habitat loss. They are protected under Mexican law and are assigned to the &quot;Special Protection&quot; category.

<doc id="604255" wikidata="Q418897" url="?curid=604255" title="Elastase">
<text>In molecular biology, elastase is an enzyme from the class of proteases (peptidases) that break down proteins, specifically one that can break down elastin. In other words, the name only refers to the substrate specificity (i.e. what proteins it can digest), not to any kind of evolutionary grouping.

==Forms and classification==
Eight human genes exist for elastase:

The four &quot;pancreatic elastases&quot;, chymotrypsin, and neutrophil elastase are serine proteases. The &quot;macrophage elastase&quot; is a matrix metallopeptidase.

Chymotrypsin is weaker at digesting elastin than the architypical pancreatic elastase.

Some bacteria (including &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;) also produce elastase; bacterial elestases work in many ways and include serine proteases, aspartic proteases, thiol proteases, and metalloenzymes.

== Function ==
The fact that elastase can break down elastin in test tubes (while other proteases cannot) does not imply that there is a unifying function for all elastases in the living body. Instead, they each have their own role:

* The pancreatic elastase (as well as chymotrypsin) is responsible for digesting proteins in food. Note that &quot;pancreatic elastase 1&quot; is, in fact, not found in the pancreas, but produced in the skin.
* &quot;Pancreatic elastase 1&quot; (CELA1) is expressed in skin keratinocytes.
* Neutrophil elastase breaks down the &quot;Outer membrane protein A&quot; (OmpA) of &quot;E. coli&quot; and other Gram-negative bacteria, killing the bacterium carrying the protein. It also very effectively breaks down &quot;Shigella&quot; virulence factors.
* In bacteria, secreted elastase breaks down host connective tissue proteins, causing tissue damage and inflammation. As a result, it&#x27;s considered a virulence factor.

Elastases of the serine protease type preferentially break down peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of small, hydrophobic amino acids such as glycine, alanine, and valine.

== Role of human elastase in disease ==

=== A1AT ===
Elastase is inhibited by the acute-phase protein α1-antitrypsin (A1AT), which binds almost irreversibly to the active site of elastase and trypsin. A1AT is normally secreted by the liver cells into the serum. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) leads to uninhibited destruction of elastic fibre by elastase; the main result is emphysema.

=== Cyclic neutropenia ===
The rare disease cyclic neutropenia (also called &quot;cyclic hematopoeiesis&quot;) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterised by fluctuating neutrophil granulocyte counts over 21-day periods. During neutropenia, patients are at risk for infections. In 1999, this disease was linked to disorders in the ELA-2 / ELANE gene. Other forms of congenital neutropenia also appear to be linked to ELA-2 mutations.

=== Other diseases ===
Neutrophil elastase is responsible for the blistering in bullous pemphigoid, a skin condition, in the presence of antibodies. It may also play a role in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

== Role of bacterial elastase in disease ==
Elastase has been shown to disrupt tight junctions, cause proteolytic damage to tissue, break down cytokines and alpha proteinase inhibitor, cleave immunoglobulin A and G (IgA, IgG), and cleave both C3bi, a component of the complement system, and CR1, a receptor on neutrophils for another complement molecule involved in phagocytosis. The cleavage of IgA, IgG, C3bi, and CR1 contributes to a decrease of the ability of neutrophils to kill bacteria by phagocytosis. Together, all these factors contribute to human pathology.

<text>The genus Petaurus () contains flying phalangers or wrist-winged gliders, a group of arboreal possums native to Australia, New Guinea, and surrounding islands. There are eight species: the sugar glider, savanna glider, Krefft&#x27;s glider, squirrel glider, mahogany glider, northern glider, yellow-bellied glider and Biak glider.

Flying phalangers are typically nocturnal, most being small (sometimes around , counting the tail), and have folds of loose skin (patagia) running from the wrists to the ankles. They use the patagia to glide from tree to tree by jumping and holding out their limbs spread-eagle. They are able to glide for distances over . Beside the distinctive skin folds, flying phalangers also have large, forward-facing eyes, short (though pointed) faces, and long flat tails which are used as rudders while gliding.

All are omnivores, and eat tree sap, gum, nectar, pollen, and insects, along with manna and honeydew. Most flying phalangers appear to be solitary, though the yellow-bellied glider and sugar glider are both known to live in groups.

==Conservation status==

While Biak and Krefft&#x27;s gliders are relatively common, most of the other species are rare. The mahogany glider is the most threatened species in Australia and is listed as endangered. They are so uncommon that they were not seen for more than a hundred years after their original discovery in 1883. Nearly a month after they were rediscovered in 1989, their habitat was cleared for plantations, and another population was not found until 1991. The reasons for the endangered status of the mahogany glider include habitat degradation or loss, limited distribution, and the lack of habitat protection. Along with mahogany gliders, the squirrel gliders (&quot;Petaurus norfolcensis&quot;) are also somewhat threatened as well. A 2020 study found that the true sugar glider (&quot;P. breviceps&quot;) also has a restricted range in Australia, making it far more threatened than initially thought.

<doc id="604259" wikidata="Q2038634" url="?curid=604259" title="U. Srinivas">
<text>Uppalapu Srinivas (28 February 1969 – 19 September 2014) was an Indian mandolin player in Carnatic classical music and composer. U. Srinivas was called the Mozart of classical Indian music and he was a child prodigy.

He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1998, by the Government of India. He was also awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 2009 given by Sangeet Natak Akademi, which is the National Academy of Music, Dance &amp; Drama, in India.

==Early life and background==
Srinivas was born 28 February 1969, in Palakollu in Andhra Pradesh. At the age of five, he picked up his father U. Satyanarayana&#x27;s mandolin, after he heard it being played at a concert he attended with his father. Upon realizing the talent of his son, his father, who had studied classical music, bought him a new mandolin, and started teaching him. Guitarist Vasu Rao, introduced seven-year-old Srinivas to western music in 1976. Soon, Satyanarayana&#x27;s guru, Rudraraju Subbaraju, (disciple of Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar) who had also taught Srinivas&#x27; father and Vasu Rao, recognized the potential of the young Srinivas and started teaching him. Since Rudraraju Subbaraju did not know how to play the mandolin, he would just sing pieces from the Carnatic classical repertoire, and U. Srinivas, all of six, would play them on the mandolin, thus developing a phenomenal style of playing entirely his own, and astonishingly, on an instrument that had never been played in the rigorous and difficult Carnatic style before. Soon, the family moved to Chennai, the hotspot of Carnatic music, where most Carnatic musicians live. When Srinivas gave his first performance it led to him being compared to the world&#x27;s greatest prodigies: &quot;Some of you have heard or read about exceptionally gifted children, our own Mandolin Srinivas, Sir Yehudi Menuhin, Beethoven, Sir Isaac Newton, Picasso, Madam Curie, the list is endless.&quot;

At a young age he was internationally viewed as the successor to Pandit Ravi Shankar.

==Career==
He made his debut public Carnatic concert performance in 1978 during the Thyagaraja Aradhana festival at Gudivada in Andhra Pradesh. Thereafter, at age eleven, in 1981, he gave his first public concert in Chennai at the Indian Fine Arts Society during the December Music Season, and never looked back. He started off playing the acoustic mandolin, but he later switched to the electric mandolin as he felt it allowed the playing of lengthy, sustained notes - the quintessential component in classical Indian music - in addition to making them clearly audible. George Harrison&#x27;s favorite piece of Indian music was Mandolin Ecstasy. &quot;It was, like, my dad&#x27;s favourite album of all time,&quot; says (Dhani) Harrison. &quot;U Srinivas is 27 now and still making music. He plays an electric five-string mandolin, he&#x27;s fantastic...&quot;

Over his career, he toured across the world, and collaborated with John McLaughlin, Michael Nyman, and Michael Brook.

He was the first musician to use the electric mandolin in Carnatic music: he modified the electric western instrument, using five single strings instead of the traditional four doubled strings to suit the Carnatic pitch, raga system, and especially gamakas, or nuanced oscillations. Starting in 1982, he performed regularly during the December season of the prestigious Madras Music Academy, performing there every year except in 2002 - December 23 of each year was a reserved slot for U. Srinivas - the highest accolade. Srinivas performed at age thirteen at the Berlin Jazz Festival. Initially booked to play a half-hour concert after Miles Davis, Srinivas won a standing ovation, and had to play for another hour. &quot;He&#x27;s got it in him. He&#x27;s fantastic,&quot; said the legendary Don Cherry at the time. Guitarist John McLaughlin first heard a tape of this concert by the thirteen-year-old prodigy, and was left very impressed. He played at the Olympic Arts Festival, Barcelona in 1992 and in 1995 recorded a successful fusion album with Michael Brook. When John McLaughlin revived his group Shakti, and renamed it Remember Shakti, in 1997, he asked Srinivas to join the group and tour the world with it, along with other Indian musicians Zakir Hussain, Shankar Mahadevan, and V. Selvaganesh. Srinivas was a leading player of the group. Srinivas toured extensively across the world, in his own right - he played in Australia, Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, and extensively and frequently across the United States and Canada.


His gifted younger brother, U. Rajesh studied with Srinivas for some 27 years and is also an accomplished mandolin player who often accompanied him at concerts during the last 20 years of his life. He also plays jazz and western music, and played the mandolin in the John Mclaughlin album &#x27;Floating Point&#x27; which received a Grammy nomination in the Best Contemporary Jazz Album Category in 2008. Srinivas and Rajesh have together composed music as well, and, besides Carnatic music, they have extensively worked on the fusion of Carnatic and western music. They also played with the Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra, with French electric bass player Dominique Di Piazza, pianist Anil Srinivasan and Stephen Devassy, a pianist from Kerala. In 2008, they collaborated again with John Mclaughlin for the album &quot;Samjanitha&quot;, which also featured Zakir Hussain, Sivamani, and George Brook. Srinivas compared Carnatic music to the Sanskrit language, &quot;It&#x27;s the basis, from which spring so many other languages. Carnatic music is here to stay with us and all other music that we play is based on that.&quot;

Over the years, Srinivas recorded over 137 albums, in diverse genres from Carnatic music solos to jugalbandis with Hindustani musicians, and world music. He performed with Western artists such as John McLaughlin, Michael Brook, Trey Gunn, Nigel Kennedy, Nana Vasconcelos, and Michael Nyman, as well as with Hindustani music artists such as Hariprasad Chaurasia and Zakir Hussain, besides Carnatic artists like Vikku Vinayakram and V. Selvaganesh. U. Srinivas started a music school called the Srinivas Institute of World Music (SIOWM) in Chennai, where, since he was barely eighteen, he taught a number of students gratis. Srinivas has trained almost a hundred students worldwide, many of whom have studied with him and U. Rajesh for as long as ten years. U. Rajesh continues teaching their students at the SIOWM.

==Instrument==
Srinivas&#x27; first mandolin belonged to his father, a clarinetist. That instrument was a &#x27;standard&#x27; Western mandolin; however, he made modifications to suit his playing style over the course of his musical career.

Srinivas started out on the acoustic mandolin, but neither the size nor plucking required of the acoustic mandolin was suited for long, sustained notes. He then switched to the electric mandolin, which was better suited for sustained notes and musical ornamentations.
In 1999, he credited American player Tiny Moore with the invention of the five-string electric mandolin. Five-strings are often tuned C-G-D-A-E, adding a mandola&#x27;s low string to the mandolin, but Srinivas said his tuning at the time was E-A-D-G-G
He later tuned his five strings to CGCGC. (He sometimes played an instrument built with a sixth tuner, which he did not use.) Copies of his style of mandolin are available in India, and several other Indian mandolin players have used instruments like it (including his brother, U.Rajesh).

==Personal life==
Srinivas married U. Sree, daughter of a vigilance officer from Andhra Pradesh, and veena player, in 1994. The couple had a son, Sai Krishna (also known as Naani Krissh, a director who made his directorial debut with Opperah in 2017), and were divorced in 2012. After their divorce U. Sree received custody of their son.

U. Srinivas was an ardent devotee of the Paramacharya of Kanchi. He was also a follower and devotee of Sri Sathya Sai Baba and had performed in front of him on several occasions.

==Illness and death==
Srinivas (also known as Mandolin Shrinivas) was undergoing treatment for a liver condition and had undergone a liver transplant on 11 September 2014. While recovering, he died at Apollo Hospital at 9:30 AM on 19 September 2014 after experiencing complications.

<text>Behzad Nabavi () (born 1941) is an Iranian reformist politician. He served as Deputy Speaker of the Parliament of Iran and was one of the founders of the Reformist party Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization. Before his career as a democratic reformist, Nabavi was considered an ideologue of the Iranian Islamic left until conservatives in the 1990s sidelined that force.

==Early life==
Nabavi was born in Tehran in 1941. His father was a historian, He graduated from Amir Kabir University of Technology with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in the mid-1960s. He received a master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1964.

==Career and activities==
Nabavi started his political activity as a guerrilla fighter against the Pahlavi government and served a prison term as a result. He had personally confirmed that when he was arrested in 1972, he had tried suicide by swallowing a cyanide pill, which &quot;fortunately or unfortunately&quot; did not work.

During the Islamic Revolution he was among the founders of the Islamic Revolution Committees (known as &quot;komite&quot; or &quot;komiteh&quot; in Iran), which served as a security force mainly working against armed opposition parties and militia, the early years of the Islamic Republic. Nabavi was also a founder of the intelligence office under the Presidency, which later became the ministry of intelligence.

Nabavi acted as the chief negotiator of Iran during the discussions with United States officials in the Iran hostage crisis, where he has been described as a &quot;radical&quot; who gained influence at the expense of &quot;moderates&quot; as a result of the crisis.

Nabavi served in different posts in the government of Iran, including a member of the Central Committee of the Islamic Revolution, the head of the &quot;Setad-e Basij-e Eghtesadi-e Keshvar&quot; (the body that introduced government-issued coupons because of economical difficulties of the Iran–Iraq War), which made the conservatives call him a &quot;couponist&quot; (which rhymes with communist in Persian), minister of heavy industries under Mir-Hossein Mousavi, and a representative of Tehran to the parliament (39% of ballots in 2000).

He also worked in some state-owned petroleum companies. He acted as the chairman of the board in Petropars and a consultant to the CEO in Mapna, a company working on the expansion of oil refineries in Iran.

As a member of the parliament, Nabavi has been one of the major critics of the Council of Guardians, the body which both vets candidates for political office and can veto legislation passed by parliament. In turn, the council banned him from running for re-election for parliamental in 2004 along with 80 other incumbents. On 1 February 2004, Nabavi resigned from parliament with more than 100 MPs, and his resignation was accepted by a 154/22/7 (for/against/absentation) vote by the parliament on 18 April 2004. In his resignation speech, he mentioned the &quot;violation of public rights&quot; as his main reason for resignation.

Nabavi was also prohibited from running for office in other elections and summoned by the judiciary for libel and &quot;disturbing the public mind&quot;, when he was serving as an MP and hence certain restrictions applied for such summoning.

Behzad Nabavi and Ali Akbar Mohtashami were among those who prevented by the Guardian council from taking part in the elections of Majlis.

==Arrest==
Nabavi was arrested after the 2009 Iran Presidential Election. He was sentenced to six years in prison by the court in February 2010.

<text>Multi-index notation is a mathematical notation that simplifies formulas used in multivariable calculus, partial differential equations and the theory of distributions, by generalising the concept of an integer index to an ordered tuple of indices.

==Definition and basic properties==

An &quot;n&quot;-dimensional multi-index is an formula_1-tuple

:formula_2

of non-negative integers (i.e. an element of the &quot;formula_1&quot;-dimensional set of natural numbers, denoted formula_4).

For multi-indices formula_5 and formula_6, one defines:

;Componentwise sum and difference
:formula_7
;Partial order
:formula_8
;Sum of components (absolute value) 
:formula_9
;Factorial
:formula_10
;Binomial coefficient
:formula_11
;Multinomial coefficient
:formula_12 where formula_13.
;Power
:formula_14.
;Higher-order partial derivative
:formula_15 where formula_16 (see also 4-gradient). Sometimes the notation formula_17 is also used.

==Some applications==
The multi-index notation allows the extension of many formulae from elementary calculus to the corresponding multi-variable case. Below are some examples. In all the following, formula_18 (or formula_19), formula_20, and formula_21 (or formula_22).

;Multinomial theorem
:formula_23 This formula is used for the definition of distributions and weak derivatives.

==An example theorem==
If formula_24 are multi-indices and formula_25, then
formula_26

===Proof===
The proof follows from the power rule for the ordinary derivative; if &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; are in formula_27, then
Suppose formula_28, formula_29, and formula_25. Then we have that
formula_31

For each formula_32 in formula_33, the function formula_34 only depends on formula_35. In the above, each partial differentiation formula_36 therefore reduces to the corresponding ordinary differentiation formula_37. Hence, from equation (), it follows that formula_38 vanishes if formula_39 for at least one formula_32 in formula_33. If this is not the case, i.e., if formula_42 as multi-indices, then
formula_43
for each formula_44 and the theorem follows. Q.E.D.

<doc id="604270" wikidata="Q7247820" url="?curid=604270" title="Production code number">
<text>A production code number, also known as the production code (PC) or episode code, is an alphanumeric designation used to uniquely identify episodes within a television series. As each studio can freely generate its own PC format, it cannot be used universally to identify the show and episode.

While, in general, television episodes are filmed in the order they are intended to be aired in, there are circumstances in which this is not the case. In these instances, the production codes can be useful in determining the writers&#x27; original intentions.

Some &quot;stand-alone&quot; shows, such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; or &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, may air episodes in radically different order to how they are produced, because character development and continuity are not major aspects of production. The airing order may in the end be decided by the network, based on ratings, sweeps months, or other networks&#x27; competition.

Other, more serialized series, like &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, will air all of their episodes in order.

In some rare cases, shows will film episodes out of order to accommodate guest stars&#x27; schedules, or to work around main stars&#x27; movie schedules. A good example of this is &quot;The X-Files&quot;, which filmed episodes out of order in its fifth and sixth seasons to accommodate the shooting schedules of main stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny.

==Format examples==
* General format for network and cable shows produced by both CBS Studios and Universal Television is SYEE, where S is the variable-letter show identifier, Y is the season number and E is a two-digit episode number during that season. The production code is only used on both CBS and NBC.
* 20th Television format for free-to-air network produced shows is YSSSEE, where Y is the season identifier from 1 to Z, S is the three-letter show identifier and E is a two-digit episode number during that season. Off-network produced shows after May 2011 is SSSYEE, previous codes were only numerical values in the form of S-Y-E. These are burned in on the end copyright slate; the letters I, O, Q, and U are not allowed to be used in the production code; however, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; defeated this rule in late 2020 as its 32nd season predominantly uses the letter Q, because it has already cycled through every other digit.
* Warner Bros. format for picked up weekly produced shows is SSSSEE, where S is the combined four-character alphanumeric show and season identifier and E is a two-digit episode number. Daily produced shows use YYYEEE, where Y is a three-digit yearly count and E is a three-digit episode count during that year. Pilots use a six-digit episode number. These are burned in on the end copyright slate. During 2016, the weekly produced and pilot formats were retired from the end slate for just the tape/reel location format of [T|U]SS.SSSEE, where S is numeric only.
* Paramount Pictures format for weekly produced shows is SSSSS-EEE, where S is a five-digit show number and E is a three-digit episode number. Daily produced shows use SE, where S is the variable-letter show identifier and E is a variable sequential-digit episode count. Only the episode portion is used on internal marketing material and feed slates.
* A number of Canadian, Australian, French, Korean, Italian, Irish, Singaporean, Indonesian, Malay and Middle East produced shows use the ISAN format, which is burned in on the end copyright slate.
* A variables and numbers of British, Filipino, Japanese, German, Spanish, Swiss, Thai, Indian, Chinese and Taiwanese produced shows use the ITU and ISAN format, which is burned in on the end copyright slate.

<text>The Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) is a non-profit organization that promotes the teaching and research of classical liberalism in higher education in the United States. IHS offers funding opportunities, programs, and events for faculty and graduate students seeking careers in academia as well as various fellowships.

Founded by F. A. &quot;Baldy&quot; Harper in 1961, the organization later began an association with George Mason University and in 1985 moved to Fairfax, Virginia. The institute is currently located at 3434 Washington Blvd. on the Arlington campus of George Mason University. It is partially funded by the Charles Koch Foundation.

==History==

The Institute for Humane Studies was founded in 1961 in Menlo Park, California, by F. A. Harper in order to promote peace, prosperity, and social harmony by fostering a greater understanding of human affairs and freedom. Initially serving as the secretary and treasurer, Harper became the institute&#x27;s president in 1966, a position he held until his death in 1973. Murray Rothbard played a key role as speaker at IHS conferences in the 1970s, promoting Austrian economics. On May 18, the 100th anniversary of the birth of Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich A. Hayek, who had been &quot;instrumental in helping F.A. &quot;Baldy&quot; Harper found the Institute in 1961&quot;, IHS staff and friends gathered to honor Hayek. Following Harper in the role of president were Louis M. Spadaro and Leonard Liggio, who served as president from 1980 to 1989. From 1998 to 2000 Stanford graduate David C. Nott, now with the Reason Foundation, led the organization as president. The current president and CEO, Emily Chamlee-Wright, served as provost and dean at Washington College from 2012 to 2016 and was previously the Elbert H. Neese Professor of Economics and associate dean at Beloit College. Her predecessor, Marty Zupan, served as president and CEO from 2001 to 2016 after serving as editor of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine.

After beginning an association with George Mason University, Liggio, Walter Grinder, and John Blundell moved the institute to Fairfax, Virginia in 1985. The organization is currently located on the George Mason University Arlington campus, along with sister organization the Mercatus Center.

==Organization and funding==

The institute&#x27;s board of directors includes Scott Beaulier, Christopher Coyne, Tyler Cowen, David Humphreys, Charles G. Koch (Chairman Emeritus), Brian Hooks, Art Pope (Chairman), Chris Rufer, Virgil Storr, Ryan Stowers, and Todd Zywicki.

IHS has received funding from a number of foundations, including the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, the F.M. Kirby Foundation, the Marcus Foundation, the John William Pope Foundation, the Ed Uihlein Family Foundation, the Ralph Smeed Private Memorial Foundation, the Koch Family Foundations, the Searle Freedom Trust, the E.L. Craig Foundation, and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.

In March 2012, in the midst of a legal dispute between Charles Koch and the Cato Institute that caused renewed scrutiny of Koch&#x27;s political philanthropy, IHS&#x27;s chief financial officer told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that Koch is &quot;a longtime and generous supporter of ours, but we&#x27;re not involved as a political organization.&quot; Charles Koch donated a total of $12.4 million to the organization from 2008 to 2012. The John William Pope Foundation has donated $2.1 million to the Institute since 1986.

IHS fundraising appeals have been targeted to specific projects in the past. In 2011, Rand Paul signed a 10-page fundraising letter seeking gifts for the institute&#x27;s Learn Liberty project, which IHS describes as a &quot;resource for exploring the ideas of a free society.&quot; Learn Liberty was acquired by Students for Liberty in 2019.

==Programs==

===Seminars===
Each summer, IHS runs several free, weekend-long summer seminars for university students from around the world. Seminars are interdisciplinary and include lectures on history, economics, philosophy, law, and political science. Seminar themes include the value of property rights, limited government, peace, natural rights, free trade, individual autonomy, and free markets. There are introductory and advanced seminars. IHS also runs weekend on-campus seminars during the academic year. IHS and Liberty Fund co-sponsor the Advanced Topics in Liberty program, which is an invitation-only, discussion-based weekend conference series.

For graduate students pursuing academic careers, IHS sponsors an annual research colloquium, policy research seminars and invitation-only Career Development Seminars designed to help students &quot;land a job in academia, gain tenure, and contribute to the academic and intellectual conversation.&quot;

===Scholarships and grants===

Each year IHS awards over $1 million in scholarships to students from universities around the world. Through its Humane Studies Fellowship program, IHS awards up to $15,000 in scholarships to graduate students embarking on &quot;liberty-advancing careers in ideas.&quot; Each summer, through the Summer Graduate Research Fellowship, IHS gives $5,000 stipends to young academics &quot;to refine and complete a publishable scholarly article or thesis chapter that engages ideas within the classical liberal tradition.&quot; The IHS PhD Scholarship awards $1,500 to &quot;students dedicated to developing, teaching, and applying the principles of a free society.&quot; Other various grants are awarded to graduate students and junior faculty to aid in their ability to present research or interview at academic or professional conferences.

===Online projects===

In 2010, IHS launched LearnLiberty.org, a website producing educational videos on libertarian ideas. The site&#x27;s stated goals are &quot;to provide a starting point for conversations on important questions: What is the nature of man and society? What are the best ways to organize human society? What is the proper role for government?&quot; Notable guest lecturers featured on Learn Liberty include David Schmidtz of the University of Arizona and Jeffrey Miron of Harvard University.

===Internships===

Each summer, for more than 20 years, IHS hosted the Charles G. Koch Summer Fellow Program. The program is now hosted by the Charles Koch Institute. The program ran for 10 weeks, and included a paid public policy internship with two career and policy seminars. Fellows were placed at one partner think tanks and policy organizations across the United States. IHS also ran a year-round journalism internship program that placed aspiring journalists at media companies and non-profit newsrooms, but both the journalism and policy internship programs have been discontinued.

In 2019, it was reported that John Elliott, who had directed IHS&#x27;s journalism internship program from 2008 to 2013, had ties to the alt-right movement. IHS issued a statement which said &quot;After careful review, we have uncovered no incident during his tenure at IHS in which Elliott exhibited anti-Semitic or bigoted views.&quot;

===Awards===

Each year, IHS awards an alumnus of its programs with the Charles G. Koch Outstanding IHS Alum Award. The award is given in recognition of &quot;significant contributions to advancing liberty.&quot; Past award winners include libertarian legal theorist and law professor Randy Barnett; Kris Mauren, co-founder of the Acton Institute; law professor Todd Zywicki; Kristina Kendall, executive producer for John Stossel; political science professor John Tomasi; Scott Bullock, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice; economist Peter Boettke; John Hood, president of the John Locke Foundation; and David Schmidtz, a professor of philosophy and economics.
