<doc id="597252" wikidata="Q174291" url="?curid=597252" title="Morning Musume">
<text>, formerly and commonly known as and colloquially referred to as , is a Japanese girl group, holding the second highest overall single sales (of a female group) on the Oricon charts as of February 2012, with the Oricon record of most top-ten singles, having 64 of them.

Morning Musume was formed in 1997 by rock singer-songwriter turned record producer Tsunku, who later composed the vast majority of the group&#x27;s songs over the decade. They are the lead group of Hello! Project that specialises in upbeat, pop-oriented music coupled with dance performance. The group produced several splinter groups, and often collaborates with other Hello! Project acts, including Country Musume, Berryz Kobo, Cute, Melon Kinenbi, and V-u-den. The group&#x27;s name can be translated as &quot;Morning Girls&quot; or &quot;Morning Daughters&quot;; it consists of members mostly in their late adolescence and early 20s.

==History==
===1997-1998: Formation and beginnings===
Japanese producer Tsunku started the group in 1997 through an audition for a female rock vocalist for his band Sharam Q. The audition was held on the Japanese TV show &quot;Asayan&quot;. The winner was Michiyo Heike, later to become a soloist under what would eventually become known as Hello! Project. Tsunku decided to form a girl group consisting of five of the runners-up: Natsumi Abe, Yuko Nakazawa, Kaori Iida, Asuka Fukuda, and Aya Ishiguro. They were issued a challenge to sell 50,000 copies of their demo single, &quot;Ai no Tane&quot;, with just five days of promotion events. They managed the feat in four promotion days (spread out over November 1997) in a very grassroots manner, and Tsunku began his mission to create the most famous all-girl group in Japan.

In early 1998, the girls were ready with their first official single, &quot;Morning Coffee&quot;. The success of this single (hitting number six on the Japanese pop charts) brought them three new members known as the second generation: Kei Yasuda, Mari Yaguchi, and Sayaka Ichii, bringing the total member count to eight. The second single, &quot;Summer Night Town&quot;, was the first single of the new lineup—a mature pop tune about unsuccessfully attempting to hide one&#x27;s true feelings. Their third single, &quot;Daite Hold on Me!&quot;, continued in the same vein musically as Summer Night Town, and managed to hit number one on the charts. Leader Nakazawa also started her solo career.

&quot;First Time&quot; was released in July 1998, featuring the singles &quot;Ai no Tane&quot;, &quot;Morning Coffee&quot; and &quot;Summer Night Town&quot;.

That year, Tsunku also formed Tanpopo, the first subgroup of Morning Musume, with Kaori Iida, Aya Ishiguro, and Mari Yaguchi. Tanpopo touted slower, more mature songs.

When &quot;Morning Coffee&quot; was released, however, Morning Musume&#x27;s label Zetima went by a different name, One Up Music (One Up is a combination of Warner Music Japan (the label that distributed One Up Music&#x27;s catalog) and Up-Front Group (One Up Music&#x27;s parent company)). However, in April 1998, one month before the release of &quot;Summer Night Town&quot;, One Up Music ended its distribution deal with Warner, and was rebranded as Zetima when it merged with Y.J. Sounds (another former Up-Front Group-affiliated label). Distribution rights would be given to Sony Music Japan&#x27;s sub label Epic Records for &quot;Summer Night Town&quot;, &quot;First Time&quot;, and all of Zetima&#x27;s subsequent releases.

===1999: Commercial success with &quot;Love Machine&quot; and the 3rd Generation===
The group released its fourth single &quot;Memory Seishun no Hikari&quot; in early 1999, reaching number two on Oricon, second to Glay&#x27;s &quot;Winter, Again&quot; which had first week sales of 955,780 copies.

The song features rap passages by L The Headtoucha and intense vocal harmonization by the group&#x27;s members. This was Asuka Fukuda&#x27;s last single with Morning Musume; Asuka claimed that she was leaving in order to focus on her studies, only to drop out of school soon after.

&quot;Manatsu no Kōsen&quot; was released in May and went to number three on the charts. Their sixth single, &quot;Furusato&quot;, was released in July.

&quot;Second Morning&quot; was released in July 1999, and contained the singles &quot;Daite Hold on Me!&quot;, &quot;Memory Seishun no Hikari&quot;, &quot;Manatsu no Kōsen&quot;, and &quot;Furusato&quot;. &quot;Daite Hold on Me!&quot; and &quot;Manatsu no Kōsen&quot; were remixed.

Tsunku held auditions for the third generation of Morning Musume, and Maki Goto was added. Goto was 13, the youngest member of Morning Musume at the time. The group&#x27;s seventh single, &quot;Love Machine&quot;, sold 1,760,000 copies, making it a major hit; it is still their highest-selling single as of 2012. It was Maki Goto&#x27;s first single and Aya Ishiguro&#x27;s last.

Goto was paired with Kei Yasuda and Sayaka Ichii to form the subgroup Petitmoni (also known as Pucchi Moni). Petitmoni&#x27;s first single, &quot;Chokotto Love&quot;, sold over 1,123,610 copies.

===2000: Koi no Dance Site, continued commercial success and the 4th Generation===
&quot;Koi no Dance Site&quot; was released in early 2000, reaching number two and selling over a million copies—400,000 away from reaching &quot;Love Machine&quot;&#x27;s success. The single had the highest 1st week sales than any other Morning Musume&#x27;s singles, an enormous amount of 600,860 copies. Even with this large number, the single did not reach number one because Southern All Stars&#x27;s biggest hit single, Tsunami, which sold total of 2.93 million copies, was released at the same date as Koi no Dance Site. Aya Ishiguro left the group before the single was released in order to marry Shinya, drummer of visual kei rock band Luna Sea, leaving the group with seven members.

The second event of 2000 was the creation of &quot;shuffle units&quot;, in which all members of Tsunku&#x27;s then 16-member family, Hello! Project, were shuffled around to form three one-time groups: Akagumi 4, Kiiro 5, and Aoiro 7. The idea was to battle for the highest single sales. This was achieved by Akagumi 4 which boasted Maki Goto as the lead vocals.

In March, their third studio album, &quot;3rd: Love Paradise&quot; was released. Despite having &quot;Love Machine&quot; and &quot;Koi no Dance Site&quot; on its track list, it did not manage to claim the number one spot, but did sell more than 800,000 copies, making it Morning Musume&#x27;s highest-selling studio album to date.

This year also brought a new generation search. The fourth generation consisted of Rika Ishikawa, Hitomi Yoshizawa, Nozomi Tsuji, and Ai Kago, lending a completely different feel to the group by adding the 12-year-old duo of Tsuji and Kago. After their debut single, &quot;Happy Summer Wedding&quot;, (continuing the legacy of number one hits with 1,370,000 copies sold,) Sayaka Ichii left to pursue her own music career. She became the vocalist of Japanese group Cubic Cross and later married fellow member Naoki Yoshizawa (no relation to Hitomi Yoshizawa).

With Ishiguro and Ichii gone, both Tanpopo and Petitmoni revised their lineups—Hitomi Yoshizawa joined Petitmoni, and Ai Kago and Rika Ishikawa were added to Tanpopo. Meanwhile, Mari Yaguchi had started performing informally with Ai Kago and Nozomi Tsuji in concerts as Mini Moni, a group tailored towards younger audiences with all the members being less than 150 cm (about 5 ft) tall. Mika Todd of Coconuts Musume was later added into the group and Tsunku made them official. Their debut single, &quot;Minimoni Jankenpyon!&quot;, was a number one hit on the Oricon.

As an idol group, they were extremely successful, drawing comparisons to the popularity of former girl idol group Speed. &quot;I Wish&quot; and &quot;Renai Revolution 21&quot; (Yuko Nakazawa&#x27;s last single) continued the trend of happy pop songs becoming staple hits for the group. Morning Musume also began their tradition of performing in musicals each year, breaking new ground as idols with their musical &quot;Love Century: Yume wa Minakerya Hajimaranai&quot;.

===2001: &quot;The Peace&quot; and the 5th Generation===
In April 2001, group leader Yuko Nakazawa left to focus on her solo career (stating her age as a factor as well—she felt it was limiting her ability to meet the physical demands of the group&#x27;s activities) making Kaori Iida and Kei Yasuda Morning Musume&#x27;s co-leaders. During this time, Rika Ishikawa was &quot;lent&quot; out to the rather inactive group, Country Musume. She did not officially join, but participated as a feature singers in number of their singles.

By July 2001 the string of number one hits had yet to be broken with the release of the single &quot;The Peace!&quot;. The Peace! features a distinctive call and response chants, with Rika Ishikawa as the center focus.

British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the promotional video echoed the song&#x27;s &quot;strangeness&quot; by placing the group in the middle of what appeared to be a gigantic public bathroom, displaying the girls dancing amongst the urinals and posing for photographs in the stalls; supposedly as a response to hidden camera footage of the members that had recently surfaced, filmed from a toilet in their production offices.

At the end of January 2001, the best selling Hello! Project album to date was released: &quot;Best! Morning Musume 1&quot;. It sold 2,259,510 copies. It featured 15 tracks, the only original song being &quot;Say Yeah! -Motto Miracle Night-&quot;.

At the end of 2001, four new members joined the group as the fifth generation through the audition &quot;Love Audition 21:&quot; Ai Takahashi, Asami Konno, Makoto Ogawa, and Risa Niigaki, bringing the roster to 13 girls. Their first single &quot;Mr. Moonlight: Ai no Big Band&quot;, (done in the style of big band) featured fourth generation member Hitomi Yoshizawa as the central focus and main vocalist of the song.

===2002 : Maki Goto&#x27;s departure and massive re-structuring of the sub-units===
In February, &quot;Sōda! We&#x27;re Alive&quot;, another hit, was released. It featured many different styles combined into one song, centered on Mari Yaguchi.

In July 2002, &quot;Do It! Now&quot; was released. This single finally broke the line of number one hits and came in at number three—a surprising fact to many, considering it was Maki Goto&#x27;s last single.

Morning Musume&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;4th Ikimasshoi!&quot; was released in March 2002 after a two-year wait. It is the first studio album from the group to reach number one on Oricon. It featured the singles &quot;Renai Revolution 21&quot;, (rerecorded with the current 13-person formation,) &quot;The Peace!&quot;, (in a &#x27;full&#x27;, longer version,) &quot;Mr. Moonlight: Ai no Big Band&quot;, (with added dialog at the beginning,) and &quot;Sōda! We&#x27;re Alive&quot;.

Late 2002 was marked by the graduation of Maki Goto and a mass re-shuffle of the sub-units. Tsunku removed Kaori Iida, Mari Yaguchi, and Ai Kago from Tanpopo, adding in Asami Konno, Risa Niigaki, and Ayumi Shibata of Melon Kinenbi to join Rika Ishikawa. Tanpopo only released one single with this lineup before the group was put on an indefinite hiatus status. Makoto Ogawa and Ayaka Kimura of Coconuts Musume joined Hitomi Yoshizawa in Petitmoni to replace Kei Yasuda and Maki Goto, but the group did not even release a single, only performing in concerts. Their song &quot;Wow Wow Wow&quot; was later released on the Hello! Project&#x27;s compilation CD &quot;Petit Best 4&quot;. In Mini Moni, Mari Yaguchi was replaced by Ai Takahashi and the new lineup went on to put out several singles and a second album until member Mika Todd left in May 2004, adding Mini Moni to the list of &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; subgroups.

In October &quot;Koko ni Iruzee!&quot; was released, a fast-paced, feel-good song about making the most of life and music&#x27;s ability to unite the world. It was number one on Oricon.

===2003: 6th Generation debut and sub-groups===
The unique childlike tune &quot;Morning Musume no Hyokkori Hyōtanjima&quot; was released in February 2003 as the group&#x27;s seventeenth single. It is significant because it was a cover song, marking the first time Tsunku did not write a single&#x27;s lyrics.

April brought the notably successful single &quot;As for One Day&quot;—a synthesizer-driven song about lost love—which sold 129,893 copies and hit number one in Oricon charts, and was the last time a Morning Musume single hit number one until &quot;Aruiteru&quot; (released late 2006). This single was the last for Kei Yasuda.

Before the auditions for the sixth generation were held, the group released the album &quot;No. 5&quot;. It was unique in a few ways. It was the last studio album to feature Kei Yasuda and Natsumi Abe as full members of the group. It was also the first Morning Musume studio album to feature a former member, as Maki Goto guests on &quot;Megami (Mousse na Yasashisa)&quot; and &quot;Ganbacchae!&quot;. It only featured two singles: &quot;Do It! Now&quot; and &quot;Koko ni Iruzee!&quot;.

In mid-2003, four new girls were added as the sixth generation: Miki Fujimoto, Eri Kamei, Sayumi Michishige, and Reina Tanaka. Eri Kamei, Sayumi Michishige, and Reina Tanaka successfully passed the traditional auditions; however, Miki Fujimoto was a solo singer in Hello!Project at the time. After appearing on the New Year&#x27;s music program &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; with several Morning Musume members dancing as backup, Tsunku added her as part of the sixth generation.

The sixth generation&#x27;s first single was &quot;Shabondama&quot;, which featured &quot;break-up&quot; lyrics, a seemingly spontaneous dance routine, and rolled &quot;r&quot;s.

Mari Yaguchi became Morning Musume&#x27;s sub-leader after Kei&#x27;s departure and was also put in charge of training and assisting the trainee group of Hello! Project Kids, eventually forming a group with five of them, known as ZYX.

Later in 2003, Morning Musume was split into two subgroups so that it could tour more cities (especially smaller cities that could not support a 15-member troupe). Morning Musume Sakuragumi, which focused on slower and more traditional love songs, included Natsumi Abe, Mari Yaguchi, Hitomi Yoshizawa, Ai Kago, Ai Takahashi, Risa Niigaki, Asami Konno and Eri Kamei. Morning Musume Otomegumi, which had more upbeat pop songs with a slight rock flavor, featured Kaori Iida, Rika Ishikawa, Nozomi Tsuji, Makoto Ogawa, Miki Fujimoto, Sayumi Michishige, and Reina Tanaka. Sakuragumi released two singles: &quot;Hare Ame Nochi Suki&quot; and &quot;Sakura Mankai&quot;, and Otomegumi released two singles as well: &quot;Ai no Sono: Touch My Heart!&quot; and &quot;Yūjō: Kokoro no Busu ni wa Naranee!&quot;.

The last single of Morning Musume in 2003 to feature the entire group was &quot;Go Girl: Koi no Victory&quot;, which had the members girlishly proclaiming the victory of their love.

=== 2004: Nozomi Tsuji and Ai Kago&#x27;s graduation ===
In January 2004, Natsumi Abe (known as &quot;the face of Morning Musume&quot; to the general public) left to pursue a soloist career. Her last single was &quot;Ai Araba It&#x27;s All Right&quot;, Morning Musume&#x27;s last song to sell more than 100,000 copies until &#x27;One Two Three / The Matenrou Show&#x27;. &quot;Ai Araba It&#x27;s All Right&quot; had uplifting lyrics and a cheery dance sequence.

The group soon released another single, &quot;&quot;. The song showcased an almost rock flavor and centered its lyrics around offering &quot;a dance&quot; to a boy. This was followed by their twenty-third single, &quot;Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari&quot;, which is unique in that it was actually about the Morning Musume girls themselves—each member got a verse about their personality. This song would later be remade several times as &quot;Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari 2&quot; and &quot;Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari 3&quot;, included in their sixth and seventh album respectively. This single also marked the leaving of fourth-generation members Nozomi Tsuji and Ai Kago in August, to focus on &quot;W&quot;, their new duo group.

In April 2004, Rika Ishikawa was caught in a rare scandal, as an audio recording revealed her saying of the group&#x27;s fans at a show, &quot;look at them. Grownups screaming like that! I can&#x27;t believe it. So stupid!&quot; 

In mid-2004, Morning Musume&#x27;s second best-of album, &quot;Best! Morning Musume 2&quot; was released and featured &quot;Yah! Aishitai&quot; as the only new track. It had a lukewarm reception at best, compared to their first best-of compilation.

Auditions for the seventh generation (named &quot;Lucky 7&quot; to commemorate the seventh generation, the seventh year of Morning Musume, and seven audition sites across Japan) were held in various Japan cities in late 2004, resulting in six finalists. However, on January 9, 2005, Tsunku surprised everyone by announcing that no one in the Lucky 7 audition would be added to Morning Musume, citing that he had set his expectations extra-high this year in hopes of finding an &quot;ace&quot;. This was the first time an audition had ended with no new members.

In November 2004, Morning Musume released &quot;Namida ga Tomaranai Hōkago&quot;, a ballad that featured Asami Konno, Miki Fujimoto, Sayumi Michishige, and Rika Ishikawa.

Following this single &quot;Morning Musume Early Single Box&quot; was released. It was a 9-CD set containing their first eight singles with a bonus track on each one, as well as a karaoke CD of some of their more popular tunes from the early years.

Finally, at the end of 2004, the group&#x27;s yearly album was released. Their sixth studio album, named &quot;Ai no Dai 6 Kan&quot;, hit stores in December. It contained three singles: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Joshi Kashimashi Monogatari&quot;, and &quot;Namida ga Tomaranai Hōkago&quot;. This was Ai Kago, Nozomi Tsuji, Kaori Iida, Mari Yaguchi, and Rika Ishikawa&#x27;s last credited studio album.

===2005: 7th Generation &quot;Miracle&quot; Member, Mari Yaguchi&#x27;s dismissal and Kaori Iida&#x27;s and Rika Ishikawa&#x27;s graduation===
On January 30, 2005, then-leader and the last member from the first generation Kaori Iida left to pursue a solo singer/artist career, with Mari Yaguchi taking on leadership role with Hitomi Yoshizawa as subleader. Her last single was &quot;The Manpower!!!&quot;, which sung about the abilities of the human race and was also the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles theme song. The beginning of 2005 also saw the beginning of Musume Document 2005, which covered behind-the-scenes material, historical footage, and interviews.

In February 2005, Tsunku started another audition for Morning Musume&#x27;s seventh generation. He noted that he was still intent on finding an &quot;ace&quot;. This audition resulted with Koharu Kusumi finally being chosen as the sole &quot;miracle&quot; member of the new generation.

On April 10, 2005, photos were taken of Mari Yaguchi with Shun Oguri (scheduled to be published in a gossip magazine &quot;Friday!&quot; on the 15th). On April 14, 2005, Yaguchi announced that she would &quot;retire&quot; from Morning Musume and would continue on with solo activities. In her public statement, Yaguchi said that due to the scandal and its publicity, she could no longer sustain an &quot;idol&quot; image befitting of Morning Musume. Because of the nature of her departure, Yaguchi did not receive a leaving concert. Sub-leader Hitomi Yoshizawa took over as the leader of Morning Musume, and Miki Fujimoto became sub-leader as of July 15, 2005.

Just days after Yaguchi resigned, on April 27, 2005, the group&#x27;s twenty-sixth single, &quot;Osaka Koi no Uta&quot; was released. The final version featured Yaguchi still, presumably because they did not have enough time to rerecord and remix it. The lyrics are in an Osaka dialect. This single was also Rika Ishikawa&#x27;s last. She left on May 7, 2005, to assume full-time leadership of the Hello! Project trio known as v-u-den.

Kusumi&#x27;s first single with Morning Musume was July&#x27;s &quot;Iroppoi Jirettai&quot;, a flamenco styled song, which was considered to be the biggest hit of the year—selling around 20,000 more copies than anything else. A 3 city handshake event was organized for the promotion of this single.

Morning Musume&#x27;s last single of 2005 was &quot;Chokkan 2: Nogashita Sakana wa Ōkiizo!&quot;, which was a remake of a previous album-only song about the importance of using your intuition and not taking good things for granted. &quot;Koi wa Hassō Do The Hustle!&quot; was going to be the title track for the single, but due to poor preview results, became the coupling track instead.

On December 31, 2005, former Morning Musume members Mari Yaguchi, Kaori Iida, Natsumi Abe, Yuko Nakazawa, Ai Kago, Nozomi Tsuji, Rika Ishikawa, Maki Goto, and Kei Yasuda joined the current lineup of Morning Musume to perform the group&#x27;s signature hit &quot;Love Machine&quot; on the 2005/2006 edition of &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;.The performance was Yaguchi&#x27;s first since leaving Morning Musume eight and a half months earlier.

===2006: Asami Konno and Makoto Ogawa&#x27;s graduation===
On January 16, 2006, it was announced that Morning Musume had won a Kanagawa Image Up Award in recognition of Hello! Project&#x27;s support of an anti-pollution campaign. Yoshizawa, Fujimoto, and Takahashi represented the group to accept the award.

In February, the group released their seventh studio album, &quot;Rainbow 7&quot;. It was the first album for Kusumi and the last for Konno and Ogawa. The album features &quot;The Manpower!!!&quot;, &quot;Osaka Koi no Uta&quot;, &quot;Iroppoi Jirettai&quot;, and &quot;Chokkan 2: Nogashita Sakana wa Ōkiizo!&quot; (in a remixed form). Kaori Iida, Rika Ishikawa and Mari Yaguchi are not credited anywhere in the liner notes although their vocals appear. Three of the songs on the album are performed by smaller clusters of several group members, and are credited in the liner notes to the featured members involved, rather than to the entire group.

In March 2006, &quot;Sexy Boy: Soyokaze ni Yorisotte&quot; was released. It featured an easy-to-learn dance and a parapara style. It was considered to be a relative success.

On April 28, 2006, it was announced by Tsunku from his official website that fifth-generation members Asami Konno and Makoto Ogawa would be leaving the group. Konno graduated on July 23, 2006, to attend University and Ogawa left on August 27, 2006, to study English abroad. Both left Morning Musume, but only Konno left Hello! Project entirely; Ogawa intended to return after completing her studies. However, as of 2007, Konno returned to Hello! Project to join the new group Ongaku Gatas, making it the first time ever that a girl who left Hello! Project actually returned. Ogawa, on the other hand, returned in June 2008 by appearing on an episode of Morning Musume&#x27;s television show Haromoni@.

Konno and Ogawa&#x27;s last single was &quot;Ambitious! Yashinteki de Ii Jan&quot;, which, yet again, featured a parapara type arrangement, with a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll flair. It was the group&#x27;s 30th single, and a limited-edition CD of all past 30 singles mixed into a thirteen-minute track was included on the first pressing. Unfortunately, sales did not meet the hype, and Ambitious! clocked in as Morning Musume&#x27;s lowest-selling single yet.

In mid-2006, the group performed the musical &quot;Ribbon no Kishi&quot;. Ai Takahashi took the main role; the secondary role was played by alternating members. There was also a mini-concert at the end of each performance, which served as Ogawa&#x27;s real &quot;leaving concert&quot;—the Wonderful Hearts 2006 concert was initially intended for Konno&#x27;s departure only, although Ogawa wore a special outfit and read her leaving comments as well. As for &quot;Ribbon no Kishi&quot;, an album with a selection of songs was released: &quot;Ribbon no Kishi The Musical Song Selection&quot;.

In mid-2006, Tsunku announced the audition for the eighth generation, called &quot;Morning Musume Happy 8 Audition&quot;. The audition started on August 27, 2006, and ended in Tokyo on October 22, 2006. On December 10, 2006&#x27;s Hello! Morning, it was announced that the only new member was Aika Mitsui. The show had a piece of audition footage each week leading up to December 10, 2006.

The last single release in 2006 was &quot;Aruiteru&quot;, which was a huge hit. It was the first single at the number one spot after 3½ years (their last number one hit being &quot;As for One Day&quot;.) The song&#x27;s lyrics were credited for its success, with lines like &quot;walking, you&#x27;re not alone because everyone&#x27;s here with you, praying for peace&quot;. It was a bit of a turn from the hyperactive singles the group had been releasing. Tsunku&#x27;s group, Sharan Q, also made a rock cover of this song.

Their first mini-album, &quot;7.5 Fuyu Fuyu Morning Musume Mini!&quot;, was released in December. It featured five tracks by solo and/or smaller combinations of group members. It also featured the single &quot;Aruiteru&quot;.

===2007: 8th Generation debut, Hitomi Yoshizawa&#x27;s graduation and Miki Fujimoto&#x27;s dismissal===
In early 2007, Morning Musume Tanjō 10nen Kinentai, a unit consisting of Kaori Iida, Natsumi Abe, Maki Goto, Risa Niigaki, and Koharu Kusumi, was created to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Morning Musume. They released a commemorative single called &quot;Bokura ga Ikiru My Asia&quot;. The members chosen symbolize the beginning of the group; how they had five members ranging in age from 14 to 24. Additionally, each member was from an odd-numbered generation (Kaori Iida and Natsumi Abe from the first generation, Maki Goto from the third, Risa Niigaki from the fifth, and Koharu Kusumi from the seventh).

On January 2, 2007, an announcement was made during Hello! Project&#x27;s 2007 Winter concert that the group&#x27;s leader at the time Hitomi Yoshizawa would leave Morning Musume on May 6, 2007, the last day of Morning Musume&#x27;s 2007 spring tour. The concert would take place at the Saitama Super Arena in Yoshizawa&#x27;s hometown.

In February, the first single with the eighth generation member Aika Mitsui was released, &quot;Egao Yes Nude&quot;. This was the first PV of Morning Musume to appear on the Dohhh!Up site (a streaming website of Hello! Project media). The single went up against tougher competition than &quot;Aruiteru&quot; had, only landing them a number four spot, although it sold relatively the same number of copies. The song has a funky, disco feel, and is highly reminiscent of some of the older songs of Morning Musume, most notably Summer Night Town.

On the March 11, 2007, edition of the weekly TV show &quot;Hello! Morning&quot;, producer Tsunku revealed he would make an important announcement in the following episode. Several days later, on March 15, he announced that two other eighth generation members would be joining the group—Li Chun and Qian Lin, both Chinese nationals, were to join as &quot;exchange students&quot;. Tsunku stated the two new members would be an important key for their group&#x27;s planned expansion into Asia and gave them the stage names &quot;Jun Jun&quot; and &quot;Lin Lin&quot; respectively. The two made their stage debut on May 6, at Saitama Super Arena. They were the first non-Japanese members of the group. On March 21, 2007, the group&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Sexy 8 Beat&quot;, was released. It was the first album for Aika Mitsui and the last album for Hitomi Yoshizawa and Miki Fujimoto. It featured the singles &quot;Aruiteru&quot;, &quot;Egao Yes Nude&quot;, &quot;Sexy Boy: Soyokaze ni Yorisotte&quot;, and &quot;Ambitious! Yashinteki de Ii Jan&quot;.

On April 25, 2007, Morning Musume released their 33rd single, &quot;Kanashimi Twilight&quot;. The song style was a huge departure from almost anything Morning Musume had released prior to it, displaying a loud, rock arrangement and the angriest lyrics since Shabondama. This would be the group&#x27;s last single with members Hitomi Yoshizawa and Miki Fujimoto.

With the success of Kanashimi Twilight, on May 1, 2007, Morning Musume became the &quot;best single selling female group in Japan&quot; with 11,085,000 copies sold—their fifth Oricon record. The achievement surpasses the previous record set by Pink Lady of 11,037,000 copies sold.

On May 6, 2007, Hitomi Yoshizawa left. Miki Fujimoto took her place as leader and Ai Takahashi replaced Fujimoto as sub-leader.

As of June 1, 2007, Miki Fujimoto resigned from Morning Musume, due to the tabloid magazine &quot;Friday&quot; running an article depicting Fujimoto and comedian Tomoharu Shoji in a relationship. Ai Takahashi replaced Fujimoto as leader (a position the latter occupied for the briefest period in the group&#x27;s history—26 days), and Risa Niigaki became subleader.

==Military and flight experience==
Cameron was commissioned in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970 at Officer Candidate School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. After graduating from The Basic School and Vietnamese language school, he was assigned to the Republic of Vietnam for a one-year tour of duty as an infantry platoon commander with the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines and later with the Marine Security Guards at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. Upon his return to the United States, he served as executive officer with India Company, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marines, at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. He reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, in 1972 for flight training, receiving his Naval Aviator wings in 1973. He was then assigned to VMA-223 at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona, flying A-4M Skyhawks.

In 1976, Cameron was reassigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he participated in the Marine College Degree and Advanced Degree Programs. Upon graduation, he was assigned to flying duty for one year with Marine Aircraft Group 12 at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan.

Selected by NASA in May 1984, Cameron became an astronaut in June 1985. His technical assignments have included work on Tethered Satellite Payload, flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), launch support activities at Kennedy Space Center, and spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control for 29, 30, 28, 34 and 33. Cameron&#x27;s management assignments in NASA include Section Chief for astronaut software testing in SAIL, astronaut launch support activities, and Operations Assistant to the Hubble Repair Mission Director. In 1994, Cameron served as the first NASA Director of Operations in Star City, Russia, where he worked with the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center staff to set up a support system for astronaut operations and training in Star City, and received Russian training in Soyuz and Mir spacecraft systems, and flight training in Russian L-39 aircraft.

He was absent from NASA between 1996 and 2003. However, following the loss of the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; and her crew, Cameron returned to the space program in October 2003, taking a founding position as a Principal Engineer in the NASA Engineering &amp; Safety Center, based at the NASA Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Virginia. In June 2005, Cameron was selected as Deputy Director for Safety of the NESC, and in June 2007 he was relocated to the NESC office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.

A veteran of three space flights, Cameron has logged over 561 hours in space. He served as pilot on STS-37 (April 5–11, 1991), and was the spacecraft commander on STS-56 (April 9–17, 1993) and STS-74 (November 12–20, 1995).

===Spaceflight experience===
Cameron flew his first mission as pilot on STS-37. This mission was launched on April 5, 1991, and featured the deployment of the Gamma Ray Observatory for the purpose of exploring gamma ray sources throughout the universe. Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed on April 11, 1991. On his second mission, he was spacecraft commander on STS-56, carrying ATLAS-2. During this nine-day mission, the crew of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; conducted atmospheric and solar studies in order to better understand the effect of solar activity on the Earth&#x27;s climate and environment, and deployed and retrieved the observatory &quot;Spartan&quot;. STS-56 launched on April 8, 1993, and landed at Kennedy Space Center on April 17, 1993. On his third mission, Cameron commanded &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-74, NASA&#x27;s second Space Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian space station Mir, and the first mission to use the Shuttle to assemble a module and attach it to a space station. STS-74 launched on November 12, 1995, and landed at Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1995.

==Post-NASA career==

Following his first NASA retirement on August 5, 1996, he joined Hughes Training, Inc., a subsidiary of General Motors Corporation, as executive director of Houston Operations. In September 1997, Cameron transferred to Saab Automobile, AB, in Sweden, as Vehicle Line Executive for the Saab 9-3 automobile. He was called &quot;Kalle Comet&quot; by his co workers at Saab. Upon his return to the United States, Cameron worked at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, near Detroit, in positions in World Wide Purchasing, Supplier Technology Acquisition, Research and Development, and Fuel Cell Vehicle Development.

Cameron retired from NASA for good in December 2008 to join Northrop Grumman Corporation as the Director of Houston Operations for Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. Cameron currently owns and flies a Cozy MK IV, an experimental airplane of composite fiberglass construction with canard design configuration and pusher propeller. He lives in Houston, Texas.

<doc id="597264" wikidata="Q21192427" url="?curid=597264" title="Crossover (fiction)">
<text>A crossover is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete fictional characters, settings, or universes into the context of a single story. They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant copyright holders (known as intercompany crossovers), common corporate ownership or unofficial efforts by fans.

This is different from a spoof, where one discrete character, setting, or universe, copies another character, setting, or universe, often in a comedic manner.

== Background ==
=== Official ===
Crossovers often occur in an official capacity in order for the intellectual property rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular, established properties. In other cases, the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept derivative of an older one. Another intention is to give fictional characters more emotional credibility and thus increase immersion for the fans.

Crossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder, but they can, more rarely, involve properties from different holders, provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome. They may also involve using characters that have passed into the public domain with those concurrently under copyright protection.

A crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover, such as characters being neighbors (notable examples being the casts from &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; and &quot;Empty Nest&quot;) or meeting via dimensional rift or similar phenomenon (a common explanation for science fiction properties that have different owners). Some crossovers are not explained at all. Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting, and have to be ignored by the series&#x27; respective continuities. Still others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing, as with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot;, where each show is fiction in the other.

=== Unofficial ===
In contrast with legal crossovers, unofficial crossovers are created solely because of the artistic pleasure derived by their creators. Unofficial crossovers often take the form of fan-written fiction and fan art, but the trope is increasingly prevalent in amateur films and audio. Whereas official crossovers are frequently stymied by such concerns as copyright, royalties payments, quality of writing and ownership of the characters, unofficial crossovers are unfettered by such concerns, so long as property holders do not exercise their right to enjoin the distribution of such material. A good example would be the unauthorised live action fan film &quot;&quot; which brings together the properties of &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Predator&quot; in one setting.

Unofficial crossovers can also occur in a &quot;what-if&quot; scenario. Roger makes frequent cameo appearances in &quot;Family Guy&quot;, while Brian makes cameos on &quot;American Dad!&quot;. Roger, Rallo Tubbs, and Klaus Heissler were seen in the final &quot;Family Guy&quot; &quot;Star Wars&quot; spoof, &quot;It&#x27;s A Trap!&quot;, as Moff Jerjerrod, Nien Nunb, and Admiral Ackbar, respectively. Stewie also appears as an interactive hallucination of Booth on &quot;Bones&quot; when the agent has issues over possibly becoming a sperm donor, with David Boreanaz (who plays Booth) repaying the favor in &quot;Road to the North Pole&quot;. An appearance by Elmo, from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, was made, in a hallucination of Connie Ray&#x27;s, on TV sitcom &quot;The Torkelsons&quot;. Fan fiction fusions between different science fiction movies and series are often created, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot; or &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and &quot;Stargate&quot;. &quot;M.U.G.E.N.&quot; is a fighting game engine that features many fan-created and fictional characters and stages from various television series, movies, as well as other video games.

== Comics ==


Crossovers of multiple characters, owned by one company or published by one publisher, have been used to set an established continuity, where characters can frequently meet within one setting. This is especially true of comic book publishers, as different characters in various Marvel, DC, or Valiant comic books frequently interact with one another since they live in a &quot;shared universe&quot;. For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, Spider-Man has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero, Daredevil, just as in the DC Comics Universe, the Flash and Green Lantern often collaborate. In comic book terminology, these &quot;guest star&quot; roles are common enough that they are generally not considered crossovers; rather, this short-term collaboration to fight crime is called a team-up. A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title. This has led to &quot;crossover events&quot; in which major occurrences are shown as affecting most or all of the stories in the shared universe; see Category:Crossover comics.

The earliest such crossover event was Gardner Fox&#x27;s &quot;Zatanna&#x27;s Search&quot; which took place in &quot;Hawkman&quot; #4 (October/November 1964), &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #336 (February 1965), &quot;The Atom&quot; #19 (June/July 1965), &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #42 (January 1966), &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #355 (September 1966), and &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #51 (February 1967). This story dealt with Zatanna attempting to reconnect with her father, Zatara, and seeking the aid of Hawkman, Batman, Robin, the Atom, Green Lantern, and the Elongated Man along the way.

The first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor-in-Chief at the time, Jim Shooter. As a way to further toy sales he devised the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; crossover which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a 12-issue miniseries to battle a common threat. After the threat was dealt with, they all returned to their regular titles. &quot;Secret Wars&quot; was hailed as both a critical and commercial success, largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters (such as the introduction of Spider-Man&#x27;s black suit which would later become the villain Venom). Jim Shooter later perfected his crossover technique at Valiant Comics with the &quot;Unity&quot; event. &quot;Unity&quot; brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat Mothergod, but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles (and two bookend special issues). Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title, but far more layered when all were read. Like &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, the &quot;Unity&quot; crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe; most notably the introduction of Turok, the birth of Magnus, Robot Fighter and the death of a major Valiant hero.

== Animation ==

Cartoon crossovers are not uncommon, and most of them – like comics or live-action TV shows – will often feature characters owned by the same company or network. One example is Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;The Grim Adventures of the KND&quot;. It features five crossovers – &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;, a reference to &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, and a quote from &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, which are all licensed Cartoon Network series.
During the 1970s and 1980s, crossovers were particularly common among the Hanna-Barbera properties. Some of the earliest examples happened on &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; which featured appearances by characters from &quot;Harlem Globetrotters&quot;, &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, &quot;Jeannie&quot;, &quot;Speed Buggy&quot;, &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, and &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. Later, the &quot;Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10&quot; set of movies involved several crossovers, including such combinations as &quot;The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones&quot;. This was taken to an extreme in the 1977–79 series &quot;Laff-A-Lympics,&quot; which was essentially a gathering of the Hanna-Barbera characters for a regular series.

Crossovers are not necessarily composed of characters under common ownership. Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies. Disney&#x27;s movie &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; had characters from various companies, most notably Disney and Warner Bros. The film also includes cameos of characters from MGM.

Another cartoon crossover would occur in 1990, &quot;Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue&quot;. This cartoon featured popular characters from children&#x27;s Saturday morning cartoons, banding together to promote an anti-drug message. ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC aired this half-hour special one Saturday morning with characters from all their networks, including Huey, Dewey, and Louie (from Disney&#x27;s &quot;DuckTales&quot;), Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Slimer (from &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot;), Michelangelo (from &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;), Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Alvin and the Chipmunks, the Smurfs, ALF (from ), Garfield, and the trio of Baby Kermit, Baby Piggy, and Baby Gonzo (from Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;Muppet Babies&quot;). Animation companies granted unlimited, royalty-free use of their cartoon characters for this project, a feat that has been unequalled before or since. This cartoon was also introduced by then-President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, and would be distributed to schools and video stores free of charge nationwide.

Webtoons (animated shows from the internet) can also have crossovers with different webtoons, franchises, YouTubers and more. Some examples are when Kate from TomSka&#x27;s &quot;Crash Zoom&quot; series makes an appearance in &quot;Eddsworld&quot; as a trick or treater who possesses Matt and Edd in the episode, &quot;Trick or Threat&quot;. In addition to this a couple of characters from &quot;Eddsworld&quot; make appearances in some &quot;Crash Zoom&quot; episodes such as &quot;Orcs and Dorks&quot;.

== Anime and manga ==
Anime has also participated in many crossover events featuring characters or shows from the same company or network. One of the biggest projects down would be &quot;Dream 9 Toriko x One Piece x Dragon Ball Z Super Special Collaboration&quot; as it includes three &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; franchises, being &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, and &quot;Toriko&quot;, crossed over into an hour long special-like most crossovers, this special is filler, a fan-service episode that follows the common plot line in most crossovers. What makes this crossover unique is when the characters from all three shows split into groups, where the members all share the same clichéd character archetypes, such the main characters Goku, Luffy, and Toriko falling into the dumb, good-natured, strong character archetype.

Manga artist Leiji Matsumoto has been known to cross over the characters of his various stories and characters such as &quot;Captain Harlock&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;, and &quot;Queen Millennia&quot;, all of which were originally written as separate, self-contained stories. In the &quot;Maetel Legend&quot;, Queen Promethium is revealed to be having been Yukino Yaoi, the protagonist from &quot;Queen Millennia&quot;. Matsumoto has also created various crossovers with &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, an anime on which he served as director, although the rights to Yamato are actually owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki.

== Film ==

The first film crossover in a series of Universal Studios monster films was &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot;, in 1943. 
After the comics publishing house Marvel Comics ventured into movie production, they set off to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, leading up to the crossover film &quot;The Avengers&quot; (2012). Inspired by Marvel&#x27;s success, Warner Bros., who hold movie rights for DC Comics&#x27; heroes, announced the production of &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016) and further plans to develop the cinematic DC Extended Universe, while Paramount Pictures and Entertainment One announced plans to create a cinematic universe on the &quot;Transformers&quot; film series.

There have been numerous crossovers in Japanese cinema. The boom of kaiju films saw a lot of crossovers produced at Toho Studios, with some of the monsters forming teams in numerous movies, much like the Marvel movie franchise. Godzilla, Mothra and Rodan (Radon) each first appeared in standalone films before being set against each other or even teaming up against stronger enemies. Their first encounter was in 1964, first in &quot;Mothra vs. Godzilla&quot; and a few months later of all three in &quot;Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster&quot;. In 1962, Toho released &quot;King Kong vs. Godzilla&quot;.

== Games ==
Crossovers in video games occur when otherwise separated fictional characters, stories, settings, universes, or media in a video game meet and interact with each other. These can range from a character simply appearing as a playable character or boss in the game, as a special guest character, or a major crossover where two or more franchises encounter.

&quot;Konami&quot; made the first crossover video game featuring Simon Belmont from &quot;Castlevania&quot;, Universal Pictures&#x27; King Kong and Mikey from the Warner Bros. movie &quot;The Goonies&quot; in &quot;Konami Wai Wai World&quot; for the Famicom in 1988.

&quot;Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games&quot;, released in Japan two months before &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, was the first time that Mario and Sonic (as well as their associated characters) appeared in a game together.

== Literature ==

In literature, some authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one.

The first popular crossover in literature was the 1885 Mark Twain novel, &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, which had an important guest appearance by Tom Sawyer. Similarly, Lady Glencora Palliser from the Pallisers series of Anthony Trollope appears towards the end of &quot;Miss Mackenzie&quot;, a novel published between the first and second Palliser novels in 1865, a character first introduced in the novel, &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot; (1864). Andrew Lang&#x27;s 1890 collection, &quot;Old Friends: Essays in Epistolary Parody&quot;, contains letters combining characters from different sources, including one based on Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; and Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

Kim Newman frequently uses this device, as does Stephen King. The works of James Branch Cabell, J.D. Salinger, William Faulkner, Margaret Laurence, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, Mordecai Richler, Sir H. Rider Haggard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov also cross over with each other, linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works.

Illustrator Howard Pyle conceived his work &quot;Twilight Land&quot; as one such crossover. In it, a nameless narrator is transported to &quot;Twilight Land&quot; and meets famous fairy tale characters for a soirée in an inn: Mother Goose, Cinderella, Fortunatus, Sinbad the Sailor, Aladdin, Boots, the Valiant Little Tailor, and others gather in the framing device and tell each other adventurous tales featuring other literary personages.

French author Jules Lemaître wrote a sort of sequel to &quot;Cinderella&quot;, named &quot;Princess Mimi&quot;, where Cinderella&#x27;s daughter is courted by Polyphemus and Charles Perrault&#x27;s &quot;Hop-o&#x27;-My-Thumb&quot;.

== Public domain ==
It is also common for authors to &#x27;crossover&#x27; characters who have passed into the public domain, and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use in other works. &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; by Alan Moore and Kevin O&#x27;Neill is another example of this, as all of the main characters and most of the secondary / background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired, and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe. Many of the works of Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Wold Newton family sequences (which has also been explored and developed by other authors) also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them (such as a blood-relationship between Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan). Roger Zelazny&#x27;s novel &quot;A Night in the Lonesome October&quot; combines Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, and the Cthulhu Mythos, although he never specifically identifies them as such (&quot;The Count&quot;, &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, etc.).

Occasionally, authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors (or at least their estates), but who are nevertheless considered iconic or &#x27;mythic&#x27; enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named (thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder). A prominent example occurs within &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One&quot;, wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr. Fu Manchu appears as a significant villain; however, as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator Sax Rohmer, he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as &#x27;the Devil Doctor&#x27;.

== Television series ==

===Between established shows===
Crossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship, but are related by time period, locale or profession. The &quot;Law and Order&quot; series, for example, afford a commonality of setting and profession which lends itself to crossovers, both within the franchise and in a wider universe. Following the cancellation of the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and its high-rated finale, several characters crossed over into the network&#x27;s remaining soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, remaining in the same timeline as their former show.

===Between related shows===
Though most common on shows of the same production company (see, for example, &quot;Hurricane Saturday&quot;), crossovers have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or television network. A notable example of this kind of link is that between &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; These shows were made by different companies, but owned by Universal Studios and broadcast on CBS. Another case is that of &quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot;, which share the character of Ursula Buffay. Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality, but rather an actress (Lisa Kudrow), a setting (New York City) and a schedule (&quot;Friends&quot; initially followed &quot;Mad About You&quot; on NBC&#x27;s Thursday night schedule).

&quot;Mad About You&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; share another type of &quot;network crossover&quot;. On rare occasions, networks have chosen to theme an entire night&#x27;s programming around a crossover &quot;event&quot;. In one case, a New York City blackout caused by Paul Reiser&#x27;s character on &quot;Mad About You&quot; was experienced by the characters on &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Madman of the People&quot;. Such &quot;event nights&quot; can also be linked by a single character&#x27;s quest across multiple shows on the same evening. ABC attempted this kind of &quot;event night&quot; crossover with its Friday night programming during the 1997 season. There, they proposed that the title character of &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; should chase her cat, Salem, through &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;You Wish&quot; and &quot;Teen Angel&quot; because it had run away with a &quot;time ball&quot; that was displacing each show through time.

In 2013, the Canadian crime drama series &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot; and &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; produced a crossover, which was complicated by the shows&#x27; incompatible historical settings; &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; is a historical series set in the 1890s, while &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot; is set in the present day. The problem was solved by having the actors cross over as &quot;relatives&quot; of their primary characters; Allan Hawco appeared on the November 25, 2013 episode of &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; as Jacob Doyle, a 19th-century ancestor of his regular character Jake Doyle, while Yannick Bisson appeared on a January 2014 episode of &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot; as Bill Murdoch, a 21st-century descendant of his regular character William Murdoch.

The earliest example of a crossover in children&#x27;s television was PBS&#x27; 1971 program &quot;The Electric Company&quot;.

====Promotional cameos====
Crossovers can take the form of a promotional cameo appearance, used to draw attention to another work of fiction, with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show&#x27;s narrative. When not clearly presented as parody, this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism. A notable example of this is &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot;, in which the character of Jay Sherman (from &quot;The Critic&quot;) appeared. It originally aired on March 5, 1995, on FOX right before &quot;The Critic&quot; began its second season, its first season having aired on ABC. This episode was largely condemned by fans of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; as existing to promote &quot;The Critic&quot;, an animated series considered inferior by comparison. Even &quot;Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening objected, preferring to remove his name from the credits of that particular episode in protest.

===Spin-offs===

In its simplest and most common form, a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a spin-off or vice versa because of established character relationships. An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when Cliff Huxtable of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; visited his daughter, Denise, on &quot;A Different World&quot;.

More complex multi-production franchises can utilize crossovers of characters to serve as a device in establishing continuity in a shared fictional universe. This crossover is common in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones. A good example of this crossover is that of the Klingons Kor, Koloth, and Kang. After the passage of about a century of narrative time, the three onetime adversaries of Captain Kirk appeared together in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode, &quot;Blood Oath&quot; – as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between, the former villains are now portrayed as heroes.

The distinction between &quot;spin-off&quot; and &quot;crossover&quot; is sometimes narrow. The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance. There is debate, for instance over whether &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; is a spin-off of &quot;Happy Days&quot;, or whether the star of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; merely crossed over into &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

====Parodic crossovers====
Often, the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome. Such difficulties are encountered by situation comedies that wish to crossover with dramatic television programs. The satirical crossover—ranging in length from a cameo to a full comedy sketch or episode—is an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem. By various means, such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious parody or homage. However, on rare occasion, the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a narrative point by capitalizing on the audience&#x27;s experience of the other program.

Parodic crossovers can be directly established as being outside the continuity of one or all of the properties being crossed over. A good example is the crossover between &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;, which was largely accepted as being outside standard &quot;X-Files&quot; continuity.

They can occur by virtue of a dream sequence, in which the characters of one show will appear as part of a dream had by a character on another show. This method was perhaps used most famously to explain to audiences that the entirety of &quot;Newhart&quot; had been the dream of Bob Newhart&#x27;s character on &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. It has more recently been used to demonstrate that cast members of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; appeared in a dream of a character on &quot;The King of Queens&quot;.

Parodic crossovers can take the form of &quot;gag&quot; cameos by characters of one property appearing on another. Crossovers of this type can also be completely wordless. This type of crossover is more common on animated programs, such as when Bender found and ate Bart Simpson&#x27;s shorts on &quot;Futurama&quot;, or Milhouse had a talking Bender doll on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. This would seem to be another case when a popular franchise is acknowledged as fiction and not a crossover of the stories.

Perhaps the most obvious parodic crossover is found when characters from two series interact outside &quot;either&quot; series. This occurs most commonly on a sketch comedy show or as a humorous interlude on an award telecast. Such crossovers may sometimes involve the real actors—for example, a sketch on &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; saw Yasir and Sarah from &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot; buying the gas station from &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, with many of the characters in the sketch being portrayed by the shows&#x27; real actors—although they may also feature one genuine star from the show amid a cast comprised otherwise of the sketch show&#x27;s own stable of actors.
Parodic crossovers can be used to lend verisimilitude to the fictional world of a program. Characters from a fictional television series may appear on a stylized version of an established non-fictional television series, such as game shows or reality shows. These crossovers between celebrity hosts and fictional characters are quite common on situation comedies. &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; once appeared on &quot;Family Feud&quot; and the townsfolk of &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; have had their heirlooms valuated on &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, for instance.

=== German crossover ===
One of the earlier instances of crossovers in TV productions outside the US is the episode &quot;&quot; (1990), which was produced by WDR and DFF as a crossover between the West German crime series and the East German crime series &quot;Polizeiruf 110&quot;. Their respective popular heroes Horst Schimanski and Peter Fuchs join forces to solve a case in the turmoil of the time after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The episode was produced during the short transition period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany.

<text>The near-open central vowel, or near-low central vowel, is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a rotated lowercase double-story a.

In English this vowel is most typically transcribed with the symbol , i.e. as if it were open-mid back. That pronunciation is still found in some dialects, but many speakers use a central vowel like or . To avoid the trap–strut merger, Standard Southern British English is moving away from the quality towards found in RP spoken in the first half of the 20th century (e.g. in Daniel Jones&#x27;s speech).

Much like , is a versatile symbol that is not defined for roundedness and that can be used for vowels that are near-open central, near-open near-front, near-open near-back, open-mid central, open central or an (often unstressed) vowel with variable height, backness and/or roundedness that is produced in that general area. For open central unrounded vowels transcribed with , see open central unrounded vowel.

When the usual transcription of the near-open near-front and the near-open near-back variants is different from , they are listed in near-open front unrounded vowel and open back unrounded vowel or open back rounded vowel, respectively.

The near-open central unrounded vowel is sometimes the only open vowel in a language and then is typically transcribed with .

== Features ==
* It is undefined for roundedness, which means that it can be either rounded or unrounded. In practice however, the unrounded variant is more common.

== Occurrence ==

He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1961, and a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton University in 1962.

Carr married his high-school sweetheart, Joann Ruth Petrie, in 1954. They had two sets of twins and six children total. They divorced and his second marriage was to Patricia Musick in 1979.

== Military service ==
Carr began his military service with the U.S. Navy, and in 1950 he was appointed a midshipman with the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) detachment at the University of Southern California. Upon graduation in 1954, he received his commission in the U.S. Marine Corps and subsequently reported to The Basic School at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. He received flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, and Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas, and was then assigned to VMF(AW)-114 where he gained experience in the F9F Cougar and the F-6A Skyray.

After postgraduate training, he served with VMFA-122, from 1962 to 1965, piloting the F-8 Crusader in the United States and the Far East. Other aircraft he has flown include the F-4, T-1A, T-28, T-33, T-38, H-13, and ground effect machines.

He logged more than 8,000 flying hours, 5,365 hours of which were jet time.

== NASA career ==
Carr was one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. When informed by NASA of his selection for astronaut training, he was assigned to the test directors section of Marine Air Control Squadron 3, a unit responsible for the testing and evaluation of the Marine Tactical Data System. He served as a member of the astronaut support crews and as CAPCOM for the Apollo 8 and Apollo 12 flights, and was involved in the development and testing of the Lunar Roving Vehicle. He was in the likely crew rotation position to fly as lunar module pilot for Apollo 19 and walk on the Moon before this mission was canceled in 1970.

=== Skylab 4 ===


Carr was commander of Skylab 4 (third and final crewed visit to the Skylab Orbital Workshop) launched November 16, 1973, with splashdown on February 8, 1974. He was the first rookie astronaut to command a mission since Neil Armstrong on Gemini 8 (later followed by Joe Engle on STS-2 in 1981 and Raja Chari on SpaceX Crew-3 in 2021) and was accompanied on the record-setting 34.5-million-mile flight by science pilot Dr. Edward Gibson and pilot William Pogue. The crew successfully completed 56 experiments, 26 science demonstrations, 15 subsystem-detailed objectives, and 13 student investigations during their 1,214 orbits of the Earth. They also acquired extensive Earth resources observation data using hand-held cameras and Skylab&#x27;s Earth Resources Experiment Package camera and sensor array. They logged 338 hours of operations of the Apollo Telescope Mount, which made extensive observations of the sun&#x27;s solar processes.

From February 1974 until March 1978, Carr and his Skylab 4 teammates shared the world record for individual time in space: 2,017 hours 15 minutes 32 seconds, and Carr logged 15 hours and 51 minute in three EVAs outside the Orbital Workshop.

In mid-1977, Carr was named head of the design support group within the Astronaut Office responsible for providing crew support to such activities as space transportation system design, simulations, testing, and safety assessment, and for development of man/machine interface requirements.

Carr retired from the U.S. Marine Corps as colonel in September 1975 and from NASA in June 1977.

== Later life ==
Carr started his post-NASA career as manager of corporate development at Bovay Engineers, Inc., a Houston engineering consulting firm. He later became a senior vice president, leaving the firm in 1981.

He was a senior consultant on special staff to the President of Applied Research, Inc., Los Angeles, California, from 1981 to 1983. From 1983 until 1985 Carr was manager of The University of Texas Telescope Project.

Carr founded CAMUS, Inc. in 1984 based in Vermont. The family-owned corporation provides technical support services in zero-gravity human factors engineering, procedures development, operations analysis, training and systems integration. CAMUS was a major contributor as a technical support subcontractor to Boeing in the crew systems design of the International Space Station. In addition, the corporation is involved in fine art production designed by Carr&#x27;s wife, artist and sculptor Pat Musick.

Carr died in Albany, New York, on August 26, 2020, four days after his 88th birthday.

== Organizations ==
Carr was a former director of the Sunsat Energy Council; a former director of the Houston Pops Orchestra; and a former director of the National Space Society.

== Awards and honors ==
He was presented with an honorary Doctorate of Science in aeronautical engineering from Parks College of Saint Louis University, Cahokia, Illinois, in 1976.

He was awarded the National Defense Service Medal; Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal; Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, and a Letter of Commendation from the Commander of Carrier Division Two. Navy Distinguished Service Medal and the Navy Astronaut Wings; 1974; University of Southern California Alumni Merit Award, 1974; Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Eagle Scout Award, 1974; Marine Corps Aviation Association&#x27;s Exceptional Achievement Award, 1974. Carr was awarded the 1974 FAI Gold Space Medal. He received the City of New York and City of Chicago Gold Medals for 1974. Carr was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997.

The three Skylab astronaut crews were awarded the 1973 Robert J. Collier Trophy &quot;For proving beyond question the value of man in future explorations of space and the production of data of benefit to all the people on Earth&quot;. In 1974, President Nixon presented the Skylab 4 crew with the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. Fédération Aéronautique Internationale awarded the Skylab 4 crew the De La Vaulx Medal and Vladimir M. Komarov Diploma for 1974. The American Astronautical Society&#x27;s 1975 Flight Achievement Award was awarded to the Skylab 4 crew. Carr accepted the 1975 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy from President Gerald Ford, awarded to the Skylab astronauts. The Skylab 4 crew won the AIAA Haley Astronautics Award in 1975 &quot;For demonstrated outstanding courage and skill during their record-breaking 84-day Skylab mission&quot;.

In 1974, Gerald P. Carr Intermediate School (previously Ralph C. Smedley Junior High) in Santa Ana, California, was renamed in Carr&#x27;s honor, and the school&#x27;s team name is the Astros, in honor of Carr&#x27;s NASA achievements.

<doc id="597273" wikidata="Q1070049" url="?curid=597273" title="Near-close near-front unrounded vowel">
<text>The near-close near-front unrounded vowel, or near-high near-front unrounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , the small capital I. The International Phonetic Association advises serifs on the symbol&#x27;s ends. Some sans-serif fonts do meet this typographic specification. Prior to 1989, there was an alternate symbol for this sound: (the Latin iota), the use of which is no longer sanctioned by the IPA. Despite that, some modern writings still use it.

&quot;Handbook of the International Phonetic Association&quot; defines as a mid-centralized (lowered and centralized) close front unrounded vowel (transcribed or ), and the current official IPA name of the vowel transcribed with the symbol is a &quot;near-close near-front unrounded vowel&quot;. However, some languages have the &quot;close-mid near-front unrounded vowel&quot;, a vowel that is somewhat lower than the canonical value of , though it still fits the definition of a mid-centralized . It occurs in some dialects of English (such as Californian, General American and modern Received Pronunciation) as well as some other languages (such as Icelandic), and it can be transcribed with the symbol (a lowered ) in narrow transcription. For the close-mid (near-)front unrounded vowel that is not usually transcribed with the symbol (or ), see close-mid front unrounded vowel.

In some other languages (such as Danish, Luxembourgish and Sotho) there is a fully front near-close unrounded vowel (a sound between cardinal and ), which can be transcribed in IPA with , or . There may be phonological reasons not to transcribe the fully front variant with the symbol , which may incorrectly imply a relation to the close .

Sometimes, especially in broad transcription, this vowel is transcribed with a simpler symbol , which technically represents the close front unrounded vowel.

== Features ==

 The prototypical is somewhat further back (near-front) than the neighboring cardinal vowels.
== Occurrence ==

T-diaeresis may be in other alphabets.

<text>The Moon &amp; Antarctica is the third studio album by American rock band Modest Mouse, released on June 13, 2000, by Epic Records.

&quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; peaked at number 120 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and received acclaim from critics, who praised its subject matter and change in sound from earlier albums and frontman Isaac Brock&#x27;s introspective lyrics. It was also hailed for being an expansion of the band&#x27;s sound, much due to their new major label budget as well as the production of Brian Deck. In 2021, NME referred to it as &quot;one of the greatest records ever made&quot;.

==Composition==
Despite the fans&#x27; common concern that the switch to a major record label would change the band&#x27;s unique sound, Isaac Brock assured fans that this would not be the case, &quot;I don&#x27;t think the new album is at all overpolished or anything. We spent more time getting crazy sounds than making things sound polished.&quot; AllMusic described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;strangely subdued.&quot; The album&#x27;s mood has been described as &quot;melancholy,&quot; and its textures have been called &quot;&quot; and &quot;.&quot; Lyrical themes explored on the album include death and the afterlife.

==Background and recording==
The album was the band&#x27;s first released by a major record label, being issued on Epic Records. 

The album was produced by Brian Deck, who first met the band at a concert in Detroit. &quot;We ended up on a bill together at The Magic Stick in Detroit, and we got along really well, we hung out till the end of the night—and maybe consumed a fair amount of beer together&quot; says Deck. Deck and Brock fell out of touch shortly thereafter, but reconnected a few years later, when Brock invited Califone (which included several members of Deck&#x27;s band Red Red Meat) to hit the road as Modest Mouse&#x27;s opening act.

The album was the first project to be recorded in Clava Studios in Chicago. When Modest Mouse band members arrived for the recording, the studio was not completely finished. Though Deck was mostly producing under Perishable Records at the time, and the studio was built mostly for Perishable projects, Deck had no problems producing under Epic Records. Despite being under a major label the band &quot;remains largely self-managed and still drive themselves across the country on tour&quot;, and Brock was fairly involved in the mixing process. Deck said of Brock&#x27;s involvement that, &quot;By the end of making the record, he was able to mastermind some cool maneuvers with plug-ins and Pro Tools. It wasn&#x27;t so much that he was mixing, but he could look at a song, understand the musical event that he wanted to make happen, understand the tools at his disposal, relate it in a way that I could understand, and make it happen pretty quickly.&quot;

In the middle of recording, Brock was attacked and had his jaw broken by a group of ruffians hanging out at a park across the street from where the band were staying in Chicago. &quot;It laid him up in the hospital for a week,&quot; Deck says. &quot;Then his jaw was wired shut for two or three months.&quot;

The recording for the album took 5 months, beginning in July 1999 and running until November 1999.
==Reception==

&quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; was released to acclaim from music critics. Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, reported an average score of 82 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; was the band&#x27;s &quot;weirdest record yet&quot; and would downplay worries that Modest Mouse&#x27;s move to a major label &quot;would smooth out the edges of the group&#x27;s brash, jerky sound&quot;, calling it a &quot;sort of concept album about cold and distant places&quot; held together by &quot;a strange sort of precision, lending lurching power to the strongest material.&quot; Nick Catucci of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; noted the album&#x27;s more streamlined production, in contrast to the lo-fi quality of their previous work, and complimented the fact that &quot;the studio scrubbing leaves no noticeable film; even the effects—like the spacey guitar that launches &#x27;Gravity Rides Everything&#x27;—ring true.&quot; Heather Phares of AllMusic felt that the production enhanced the album&#x27;s introspective tone and called the album &quot;their most cohesive collection of songs to date&quot; and &quot;an impressive, if flawed, map of Modest Mouse&#x27;s ambitions and fears.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; as being &quot;beyond anything else they&#x27;ve ever achieved&quot;.

Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; remarked that Isaac Brock &quot;may be every bit the ass he claims, but basically he seems chagrined that he was ever so inept or unlucky as to get caught up in this, as the saying goes, downward spiral. And unlike other rock pessimists we might name, he&#x27;s so modest about it that he ends up with an uplifting representation of human life as damn shame.&quot; Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; as an &quot;intoxicating mix of uncertainty and confidence&quot;. &quot;LA Weekly&quot;″s Rita Neyler called the album &quot;darker and colder&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous work, but nonetheless representative of &quot;the very particular blend of peculiar lyrics and uncompromising rock that consistently weaves through all their records.&quot; In a negative review, &quot;Spin&quot;″s Chris Ryan felt that &quot;mistaking subject for style, Modest Mouse has chosen to accentuate on a tendency to drift rather than an ability to write emotionally effective songs.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; as the third best album of 2000, trailing &quot;Kid A&quot; by Radiohead and &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot; by Sigur Rós. The album ranked at number 49 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop year-end critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; later named it the seventh best album of the years 2000 through 2004 and the sixth best album of the decade. &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; placed it at number 51 on their decade-end list. &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; was included in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The New Classics,&quot; a list of the one hundred best albums released within 1983 to 2008. Rhapsody ranked the album at number four on its &quot;Alt/Indie&#x27;s Best Albums of the Decade&quot; list.

As of October 2006 the album has sold 492,000 copies in United States. In March 2009, &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 2015, Vitamin String Quartet paid tribute to the album by covering it in its entirety.

==Reissues==
Isaac Brock was dissatisfied with the final mix and the album artwork for &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; following its original 2000 release. According to an interview given in &quot;Filter&quot; in 2004, he intended to remix the album &quot;on his own time, using his own money, simply to have a copy he alone could hear&quot;. Epic Records then offered to remaster the album to CD, reissuing it on March 9, 2004 with remastered audio, new artwork and four additional tracks from a BBC Radio 1 session. Stephen M. Deusner of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; rated the remastered edition a 5.0 out of 10, writing highly of the original album itself but questioning the decision to re-release it just four years after its initial release, calling the additional material &quot;paltry offerings&quot; and commenting that &quot;no one was really asking for it, and there&#x27;s simply not enough here to justify the expense or even a rating as high as the original.&quot;

A vinyl and CD reissue was released on April 13, 2010 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the album, with both versions reverting to the original artwork and track listing. On April 27, 2015, Music on Vinyl reissued the album in two different variations in Europe, with one featuring remastered audio on transparent 180g vinyl in a production run limited to 500 pressings, and the other on standard black vinyl. Both removed the &quot;locked groove&quot; previously found on side 1 at the end of &quot;Perfect Disguise&quot;.

<doc id="597280" wikidata="Q644029" url="?curid=597280" title="Robert J. Cenker">
<text>Robert Joseph &quot;Bob&quot; Cenker (born November 5, 1948) is an American aerospace and electrical engineer, aerospace systems consultant, and former astronaut. Cenker worked for 18 years at RCA Astro-Electronics, and its successor company GE Astro Space, on a variety of spacecraft projects. He spent most of his career working on commercial communications satellites, including the Satcom, Spacenet and GStar programs.

In January 1986, Cenker was a crew member on the twenty-fourth mission of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program, the seventh flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, designated as mission STS-61-C. Cenker served as a Payload Specialist, representing RCA Astro-Electronics. This mission was the final flight before the Challenger disaster, which caused the Space Shuttle program to be suspended until 1988, and impacted NASA&#x27;s Payload Specialist program for even longer. As a result, Cenker&#x27;s mission was called &quot;The End of Innocence&quot; for the Shuttle program. Following the completion of his Shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the commercial aerospace field. Since his flight, he has made numerous public appearances representing NASA and the Shuttle program, in the United States, as well as internationally.

==Early life and education==
Cenker was born on November 5, 1948, and raised in Menallen Township, Pennsylvania. He started his education at St. Fidelis College Seminary in Herman, Pennsylvania, leaving in 1962. In 1970 Cenker enrolled at Penn State University where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering. He continued his studies at Penn State and earned a Master of Science degree in 1973, also in aerospace engineering. Cenker earned a second Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from Rutgers University in 1977.

==Pre-spaceflight career==
Cenker worked for 18 years at RCA Astro-Electronics and its successor company GE Astro Space. Cenker worked on hardware design and systems design concerning satellite attitude control. He also worked on in-orbit operations, as well as spacecraft assembly, test, and pre-launch operations. He spent two years on the Navy navigation satellite program, but spent most of his career working on commercial communications satellites.

Cenker&#x27;s positions included integration and test manager for the Satcom D and E spacecraft, where he was responsible for all launch site activities. He also served as spacecraft bus manager on the Spacenet/GStar programs. He was responsible for ensuring the spacecraft could interface with multiple rockets, including the Delta, Space Shuttle, and Ariane launch vehicles.

==Spaceflight experience==

As an incentive for a spacecraft owner to contract with NASA to use a Shuttle launch instead of an unmanned, commercial launch system, NASA permitted contracting companies to apply for a payload specialist seat on the same mission. When RCA contracted with NASA to launch Satcom Ku-1, RCA Astro-Electronics&#x27; manager of systems engineering for the Satcom-K program Bob Cenker, and his co-worker Gerard Magilton, were selected to train as payload specialists so that one of the pair could accompany Satcom Ku-1 into space. Cenker and Magilton trained with career astronauts as well as other payload and mission specialists, including those scheduled for the next scheduled flight, that of the &quot;Challenger&quot; mission, STS-51-L.

This flight of &quot;Columbia&quot; was originally scheduled to occur in August 1985, but the timeline slipped. In July 1985 the payload was finalized to include the RCA satellite, and Cenker was assigned to the mission, now designated as STS-61-C. Magilton was assigned as the back-up.

Prior to its successful launch, &quot;Columbia&quot; had several aborted launch attempts, including one on January 6 which was &quot;one of the most hazardous in the Shuttle’s operational history&quot; to that point. As documented in Crewmember Bill Nelson&#x27;s book &quot;Mission: An American Congressman&#x27;s Voyage to Space&quot;, and as reported in Spaceflight Insider, &quot;The launch attempt on Jan. 6, 1986 was halted at T-31 seconds. The weather was perfect for the scheduled launch at dawn, but a failure of a liquid oxygen drain valve prevented it to close properly. The valve was then closed manually, but not quickly enough to prevent a low temperature in one fuel line.&quot; However, Nelson says that what really happened was that &quot;the valve did not close because it was not commanded to close&quot;, and that it was later determined that the Rogers Commission, investigating the series of mistakes that forced this second scrub, recognized that the problems were personnel-related, caused by fatigue from overwork: One potentially catastrophic human error occurred 4 minutes 55 seconds before the scheduled launch of mission 61-C on January 6, 1986. According to a Lockheed Space Operations Company incident report, 18,000 pounds of liquid oxygen were inadvertently drained from the Shuttle external fuel tank due to operator error. Fortunately, the liquid oxygen flow dropped the main engine inlet temperature below the acceptable limit causing a launch hold, but only 31 seconds before lift-off. As the report states, &quot;Had the mission not been scrubbed, the ability of the orbiter to reach a defined orbit may have been significantly impacted.

There was another near-catastrophic launch abort three days later. Referring to the January 9 abort, pilot Charlie Bolden later stated that it &quot;...would have been catastrophic, because the engine would have exploded had we launched. In all, it took a record eight attempts to get &quot;Columbia&quot; off the ground. &quot;Columbia&quot; finally launched and achieved orbit on January 12, 1986, with a full crew of seven. Along with Cenker, the crew included Robert L. &quot;Hoot&quot; Gibson, future NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden, George D. Nelson, Steven A. Hawley, Franklin R. Chang-Diaz, and US Representative Bill Nelson. Cenker and his crewmates traveled over 2.5 million miles in 98 orbits aboard Columbia and logged over 146 hours in space.
During the six-day mission, January 12–18, Cenker performed a variety of physiological tests, operated a primary experiment – an infrared imaging camera – and assisted with the deployment of RCA Americom&#x27;s Satcom Ku-1 satellite, the primary mission objective. Satcom Ku-1 was deployed nearly 10 hours into the mission, and Satcom later reached its designated geostationary orbital position at 85 degrees West longitude where it remained operational until April 1997, the last major commercial satellite deployed by the Space Shuttle program. In a 2014 video of the &quot;Tell Me a Story&quot; series titled &quot;Close My Eyes &amp; Drift Away&quot;, posted to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex YouTube channel, Cenker tells a humorous story regarding a zero-g sleeping problem he faced on his mission.

The next Shuttle launch, ten days after the return of &quot;Columbia&quot;, resulted in the destruction of the &quot;Challenger&quot; with the loss of all aboard, including Cenker&#x27;s counterpart from Hughes Aircraft, civilian crew member and Payload Specialist Greg Jarvis. Accordingly, commander Gibson later called the STS-61-C mission &quot;The End of Innocence&quot; for the Shuttle program.

Following the Challenger disaster, the Shuttle fleet was grounded until 1988. Even after Shuttle missions resumed, civilian payload specialists like Cenker were excluded until the payload specialist program was reinstated on December 2, 1990, when Samuel T. Durrance, an Applied Physics Laboratory astrophysicist and Ronald A. Parise, a Computer Sciences Corporation astronomer, flew aboard STS-35. By that time, RCA had been purchased by General Electric, and RCA Astro-Electronics became part of GE. Following two additional ownership transitions, the facility was closed in 1998. As a result, Cenker was the only RCA Astro-Electronics employee, and only employee in the history of the facility under all of its subsequent names, to ever fly in space.

NASA&#x27;s Payload Specialist program has been criticized for giving limited Shuttle flight positions to civilian aerospace engineers such as Cenker and Greg Jarvis (killed aboard &quot;Challenger&quot;), politicians such as Bill Nelson, and other civilians such as Teacher in Space Christa McAuliffe (also killed aboard &quot;Challenger&quot;). Even the flight of former Mercury astronaut and US Senator John Glenn was questioned. The concern was that these people had replaced career astronauts in very limited flight opportunities, and some may have flown without fully understanding the level of danger involved in a Shuttle mission.

==Post-spaceflight==

Following the completion of his Shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the civilian aerospace field. Cenker&#x27;s last two years with RCA Astro-Electronics and its successor GE Astro Space were spent as Manager of Payload Accommodations on an EOS spacecraft program. After leaving GE, Cenker served as a consultant for various aerospace companies regarding micro-gravity research, and spacecraft design, assembly and flight operations. Cenker supported systems engineering and systems architecture studies for various spacecraft projects, including smallsats, military communications satellites, and large, assembled-in-orbit platforms. His contributions included launch vehicle evaluation and systems engineering support for Motorola on Iridium, and launch readiness for the Globalstar constellation. Other efforts include systems engineering and operations support for Intelsat on Intelsat K and Intelsat VIII, for AT&amp;T on Telstar 401 and 402, for Fairchild-Matra on SPAS III, for Martin Marietta on Astra 1B, BS-3N, ACTS, and for the Lockheed Martin Series 7000 communications satellites.

In 2017, Cenker&#x27;s STS-61C crewmate former US Senator Bill Nelson spoke at a session of the US House of Representatives. In an address, titled &quot;Mission to Mars and Space Shuttle Flight 30th Anniversary&quot;, he read into the Congressional Record the details of the mission of STS-61C, as well as the names and function of each crew member including Cenker.

In June 2017, Cenker traveled to Scotland where he and astronaut Doug Wheelock gave a series of talks to children in Fife schools as part of the Scottish Space School.

Cenker continues to make periodic public appearances representing NASA and the astronaut program, including at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in March 2017, January 2023, and April 2024.

===Apollo 11 commemoration activities===
Leading up to the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, Cenker participated in several public events with other former NASA astronauts.

During an interview to discuss his scheduled appearance at The New Jersey Governor&#x27;s School of Engineering &amp; Technology at Rutgers University in July 2019, Cenker talked about his education at Rutgers, his work at RCA, his shuttle mission, his connection to the Challenger crew, his thoughts on the importance of the Apollo 11 mission, and of space travel in general. He concluded:
The Cradle of Aviation in Garden City, New York invited Cenker to participate in its &quot;Moon Fest&quot; planned for July 20, 2019, exactly fifty years after the Apollo 11 landing. It was announced that Cenker would join two fellow shuttle astronauts from New York, Bill Shepherd and Charlie Camarda, at the celebration.

==Personal life and beliefs==
Bob Cenker is married to Barbara Ann Cenker; they have two sons and a daughter. 

In a July 2019 interview discussing the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11, Cenker commented that he believes that humans have an innate desire to explore, saying &quot;It’s not learned... It’s in your genes&quot;. Discussing his religious beliefs, Cenker said &quot;I&#x27;m a good, practicing Catholic. One of the guys I flew with was an agnostic. I think going into space reinforces what you believe when you went... [The agnostic astronaut] couldn’t grasp how one being could create all this. I came back thinking ‘God, you have to be there’&quot;.

<text>Panjshir (Dari: , literally &quot;Five Lions,&quot; pronounced , also spelled as Panjsher) is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the northeastern part of the country containing the Panjshir Valley. The province is divided into seven districts and contains 512 villages. As of 2021, the population of Panjshir province was about 173,000. Its current governor is Mohammad Agha Hakim.

Panjshir became an independent province from neighboring Parwan Province in 2004. It is bordered by Baghlan and Takhar in the north, Badakhshan and Nuristan in the east, Laghman and Kapisa in the south, and Parwan in the west.

== History ==
The territory fell to Babur in the early 16th century. It was later conquered by Ahmad Shah Durrani, and officially became part of the Durrani Empire. The rule of the Durranis was followed by that of the Barakzai dynasty. During the 19th century, the region was governed by the Emirate of Afghanistan. Florentia Sale crossed this river during her captivity under Wazir Akbar Khan in 1842 during the First Anglo-Afghan War. Like the rest of Afghanistan, Panjshir became part of the newly established Kingdom of Afghanistan in June 1926.

In July 1973, troops under the command of General &quot;Sardar&quot; Mohammed Daoud Khan overthrew the Afghan monarchy and established the Republic of Afghanistan. In this &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, General Daoud seized power for himself, effectively proclaiming himself as the first President of Afghanistan. He began making claims over large swathes of Pashtun-dominant territory in Pakistan, causing great anxiety to the government of Pakistan. By 1975, the young Ahmad Shah Massoud and his followers initiated an uprising in Panjshir, but were forced to flee to Peshawar in Pakistan where they received support from Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto is said to have paved the way for the April 1978 Saur Revolution in Kabul by making General Daoud spread the Afghan Armed Forces to the countryside.

Panjshir was attacked multiple times during the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War, against Ahmad Shah Massoud and his forces. The Panjshir region was in rebel control from August 17, 1979, after a regional uprising. Aided by its mountainous terrain, the region was well defended by mujahedeen commanders during the war against the PDPA government and the Soviet Union.

After the collapse of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan in 1992, the area became part of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. By the late 1990s, Panjshir and neighboring Badakhshan province served as a staging ground for the Northern Alliance against the Taliban. On September 9, 2001, Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud was assassinated by two al-Qaeda operatives. Two days later the September 2001 attacks occurred in the United States and this led to the start of a major U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.

Containing the Panjshir Valley, in April 2004 Panjshir District of Parwan Province was turned into a province under the Karzai administration. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) established several bases in the province. In the meantime, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) also established bases, a US-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) began operating in Panjshir in the late 2000s.

Following the Fall of Kabul on 15 August 2021, anti-Taliban forces loyal to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan fled to the Panjshir Province. They formed the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan and kept fighting the new Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in an ongoing conflict. The new resistance forces flew the old flag of the Northern Alliance. The resistance has held the Panjshir Valley and captured districts in neighboring provinces. By early September 2021, Taliban forces managed to push into Panjshir and capture several districts from the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, before gaining control of Bazarak on 6 September, pushing remaining resistance fighters into the mountains. However, clashes still remain ongoing between the Taliban and resistance fighters in Panjshir Province. A subsequent visit by Radio Télévision Suisse and Journeyman Pictures into Bazarak in October 2021 also revealed that despite claims of NRF inactivity by local Taliban officials, an armed confrontation between the NRF Taliban was in fact occurring in an undisclosed location in the mountains surrounding Bazarak, with resistance forces gaining the upper hand, thus confirming that the NRF remains still active near Bazarak and in Panjshir Province. Although the NRF continues to carry out attacks, it does not control any territory in the province.&lt;ref name=&quot;VOA 12/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare==
The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 16% in 2005, to 17% in 2011.

23% of births in 2011 were attended to by a skilled birth attendant.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 33% in 2005 to 32% in 2011. 
The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) fell from 42% in 2005 to 40% in 2011.
Four Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) schools service the agriculturally-oriented Panjshir Province, including the Ahmad Shah Massoud TVET. The school was established with the help from the Hilfe Paderborn and German Foreign Office and as of 2014 had about 250 students and 22 staff members.

==Demographics==
As of 2021, the total population of the province is about 173,000. &quot;Ethnic Tajiks form the majority of the population, but there are small numbers of Hazaras and Pashtuns as well.&quot; There is a Sunni Hazara minority in the province, who form the majority in Darah district.

Dari is the dominant language in the province. Pashto is understood by a few as a second or third language. All inhabitants are followers of Islam, and exclusively Sunni.

The proportion of residents living below the national poverty line was 19.1%.

<doc id="597287" wikidata="Q965123" url="?curid=597287" title="Near-close near-front rounded vowel">
<text>The near-close front rounded vowel, or near-high front rounded vowel, is a type of vowel sound, used in some spoken languages.

The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a small capital version of the Latin letter y, and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

&quot;Handbook of the International Phonetic Association&quot; defines as a mid-centralized (lowered and centralized) close front rounded vowel (transcribed or ), and the current official IPA name of the vowel transcribed with the symbol is &quot;near-close near-front rounded vowel&quot;. However, acoustic analysis of cardinal vowels as produced by Daniel Jones and John C. Wells has shown that basically &quot;all&quot; cardinal front rounded vowels (so not just but also ) are near-front (or &quot;front-central&quot;) in their articulation, so may be just a lowered cardinal (), a vowel that is intermediate between cardinal and cardinal . In many languages that contrast close, near-close and close-mid front rounded vowels, there is no appreciable difference in backness between them. In some transcriptions, the vowel is transcribed with or . When that is the case, this article transcribes it with the symbols (a lowered ) and (a raised ), respectively. implies too weak a rounding in some cases (specifically in the case of the vowels that are described as &quot;tense&quot; in Germanic languages, which are typically transcribed with ), which would have to be specified as .

In some languages, however, is used to transcribe a vowel that is as low as close-mid but still fits the definition of a lowered and centralized (or just lowered) cardinal . It occurs in German Standard German as well as some dialects of English (such as Estuary), and it can be transcribed with the symbol (a lowered ) in narrow transcription. For the close-mid front rounded vowel that is not usually transcribed with the symbol (or ), see close-mid front rounded vowel.

In most languages, the rounded vowel is pronounced with compressed lips (in an &quot;exolabial&quot; manner). However, in a few cases, the lips are protruded (in an &quot;endolabial&quot; manner), such as in Swedish, which contrasts the two types of rounding.

==Transcription==
The near-close front rounded vowel is transcribed with , and in world&#x27;s languages. However, when the Latin or are used for this vowel, may still be used for phonological reasons for a vowel that is &quot;lower&quot; than near-close, potentially leading to confusion. This is the case in several Germanic language varieties, as well as in some transcriptions of Shanghainese.

In the following table, the difference between compressed and protruded vowels is ignored, except in the case of Swedish. Short vowels transcribed with , , and in broad transcription are assumed to have a weak rounding in most cases.

==Near-close front compressed vowel==
The near-close front compressed vowel is typically transcribed in IPA simply as , and that is the convention used in this article. There is no dedicated diacritic for compression in the IPA. However, the compression of the lips can be shown with the letter as (simultaneous and labial compression) or ( modified with labial compression). The spread-lip diacritic may also be used with a rounded vowel letter as an symbol, though technically &#x27;spread&#x27; means unrounded.

The close-mid front compressed vowel can be transcribed , or .

===Features===
 The prototypical has a weak compressed rounding, more like than the neighboring cardinal vowels.

===Occurrence===
Because front rounded vowels are assumed to have compression, and few descriptions cover the distinction, some of the following may actually have protrusion. Vowels transcribed with and may have a stronger rounding than the prototypical value of .

==Near-close front protruded vowel==

Catford notes that most languages with rounded front and back vowels use distinct types of labialization, protruded back vowels and compressed front vowels. However, a few languages, such as Scandinavian languages, have protruded front vowels. One of them, Swedish, even contrasts the two types of rounding in front vowels as well as height and duration.

As there are no diacritics in the IPA to distinguish protruded and compressed rounding, the old diacritic for labialization, , will be used here as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; symbol for protruded front vowels. Another possible transcription is or (a near-close front vowel modified by endolabialization), but that could be misread as a diphthong.

The close-mid front protruded vowel can be transcribed , or .

For the close-mid front protruded vowel that is not usually transcribed with the symbol (or ), see close-mid front protruded vowel.

Acoustically, this sound is &quot;between&quot; the more typical compressed near-close front vowel and the unrounded near-close front vowel .

===Features===
 The prototypical has a weak rounding (though it is compressed, rather than protruded), more like than the neighboring cardinal vowels.

<text>Leroy Russel Chiao (; born August 28, 1960) is an American chemical engineer, retired NASA astronaut, entrepreneur, motivational speaker, and engineering consultant. Chiao flew on three Space Shuttle flights, and was the commander of Expedition 10, where he lived on board the International Space Station from October 13, 2004 to April 24, 2005. He is also a co-author and researcher for the Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity project.

==Early life and education==
Chiao was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and raised in Danville, California. His parents are Taiwanese &quot;waishengren&quot; who were born in Shandong province in mainland China but moved to Taiwan. They met while studying at a Taiwanese university in the 1950s before immigrating to the U.S. 

Chiao graduated from Monte Vista High School in Danville in 1978. In 1983, he earned a B.S. in chemical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley. He later earned an M.S. and a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1985 and 1987, respectively.

Chiao&#x27;s parents were chemical engineers who immigrated to Milwaukee from the Republic of China in the late 1950s for graduate school. Stressing a high doctorate-level science education, his parents encouraged him to follow their lead and become an engineer. Chiao&#x27;s aviator call sign is &quot;Shandong,&quot; the name of the Chinese province where his parents grew up.

==Pre-NASA career==


Upon graduation, Chiao joined the Hexcel Corporation in Dublin, California from 1987 to 1989. He was involved in process, manufacturing, and engineering research on advanced aerospace materials, and worked on a joint NASA-JPL/Hexcel project to develop a practical, optically correct, precision segment reflector made entirely of advanced polymer composite materials for future space telescopes, as well as working on cure modeling and finite element analysis. In January 1989, Chiao joined the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California, where he was involved in processing research for the fabrication of filament-wound and thick-section aerospace composites. Chiao also developed and demonstrated a mechanistic cure model for graphite fiber and epoxy composite material (see Graphite-reinforced plastic). An instrument-rated pilot, Chiao has logged over 2500 flight hours in a variety of aircraft.

==NASA career==
At age 29, Chiao was selected by NASA in January 1990 (the youngest in Group 13) and became an astronaut in July 1991. He qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. His technical assignments included: Space Shuttle flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); crew equipment, Spacelab, Spacehab, and payload issues for the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch; training and flight data file issues; and extravehicular activity (EVA) issues for the EVA Branch. Chiao is Chief of the Astronaut Office EVA Branch.

A veteran of four space flights, Chiao flew as a mission specialist on STS-65 in 1994, STS-72 in 1996 and STS-92 in 2000. Chiao had logged over 36 days and 12.5 hours in space, including over 26 EVA hours in four spacewalks, before his mission aboard the International Space Station.

Chiao is fluent in Mandarin Chinese. Additionally, Chiao also learned Russian to communicate with Russian cosmonauts as part of the International Space Station program. On November 2, 2004, Chiao voted in the 2004 United States presidential election while aboard the International Space Station, making him the first American to vote in a presidential election while in space. McDonald&#x27;s presented Chiao with a Big Mac and French fries at their branch in Star City as one of his first meals since returning to Earth after his ISS assignment. Among the souvenirs he brought into space in his previous space flights were a Chinese flag and a quartz-carved rose from Hong Kong.

Chiao was the inadvertent developer of the procedure to use the IRED (Interim Resistive Exercise Device) to excite the solar arrays of the ISS. During an exercise session of squats on the ISS, Chiao sent a vibration through the space station that caused the solar arrays to ripple – a low amplitude frequency response. When Chiao did this, the response from Mission Control was &quot;knock it off.&quot; However, several years later during an ISS assembly flight in December 2006 (STS-116), German astronaut Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency was told to do 30 seconds of robust exercise on the bungee-bar IRED machine to help retract ISS solar arrays, specifically to relieve tension in a wire system that was preventing the array from folding up like an accordion. An eventual unplanned spacewalk during the same shuttle mission retracted the array.

Chiao left NASA in December 2005 to pursue employment in the private sector.

===Spaceflight experience===

STS-65 &quot;Columbia&quot; (July 8–23, 1994) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, setting a new flight duration record for the Space Shuttle program at that time. The STS-65 mission flew the second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2). During the 15-day flight, the seven-member crew conducted more than 80 experiments focusing on materials and life sciences research in microgravity. The STS-65 mission was accomplished in 236 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.1 million miles in 353 hours and 55 minutes.

STS-72 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (January 11–20, 1996) was a nine-day mission during which the crew retrieved the Space Flyer Unit (launched from Japan ten months earlier), and deployed and retrieved the OAST-Flyer. Chiao performed two spacewalks designed to demonstrate tools and hardware and evaluate techniques to be used in the assembly of the International Space Station. In completing this mission, Chiao logged 214 hours and 41 seconds in space, including just over thirteen EVA hours, and traveled 3.7 million miles in 142 orbits of the Earth.

STS-92 &quot;Discovery&quot; (October 11–24, 2000) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 13-day flight, the seven-member crew attached the Z1 Truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to the International Space Station using Discovery&#x27;s robotic arm and performed four spacewalks to configure these elements. This expansion of the ISS opened the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first resident crew. Chiao totaled 13 hours and 16 minutes of EVA time in two spacewalks. The STS-92 mission was accomplished in 202 orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 12 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes, and 25 seconds.

ISS Expedition 10 (October 9, 2004 – April 24, 2005), Chiao was the commander of Expedition 10 on the International Space Station.

==Post-NASA career==
After leaving NASA, Chiao became involved in entrepreneurial business ventures in the U.S. and China.

In early 2006, he joined the Atlanta firm of SpaceWorks Enterprises, Inc. (SEI) as an affiliate and technical advisor (on a non-exclusive basis). Dr. Chiao assists the firm on space technologies and operating processes for future space exploration concepts and research on the commercialization of space. In July 2006, Chiao accepted a position as the Executive Vice President for Space Operations and a Director of Excalibur Almaz Limited. He was responsible for operational aspects of spaceflight, including training for both the capsule and space station. The company assembled a team from the Isle of Man, the United States, Russia, Ukraine, and Continental Europe to begin work towards refurbishing and flying a capsule in space based upon the design of the Almaz capsules.

In March 2006, Chiao began an appointment in the mechanical engineering department at the Louisiana State University as the first Raborn Distinguished Chair Max Faget Professor.

Chiao is the chairman of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute (NSBRI) User Panel, which is attached to the Baylor College of Medicine. The NSBRI, funded by NASA, is a consortium of institutions studying the health risks related to long-duration space flight. The Institute&#x27;s User Panel is an advisory board composed of former and current astronauts and flight surgeons that ensures NSBRI&#x27;s research program is focused on astronaut health and safety. In preparation for lunar and Mars exploration, Chiao and the User Panel will help align NSBRI&#x27;s science and technology projects with the needs of astronauts on long missions.

In July 2007, Chiao joined an expedition to visit Devon Island and conduct 5 days of webcasts and other instructional activities spanning the period of 16–20 July 2007. This activity was in collaboration with the Mars Institute, the Challenger Center for Space Science Education, The Explorers Club and SpaceRef Interactive, Inc. He conducted these webcasts from the Haughton-Mars Project Research Station and nearby locations to illustrate how NASA and other space agencies are learning to live on the Moon and Mars here on Earth.

He graduated number one in his class to win the Liethen-Tittle Award, as the outstanding test pilot at the school.

Chilton was assigned to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, where he conducted weapons and systems tests in all models of the F-15 and F-4 aircraft. While a member of the 3247th Test Squadron, Chilton served as squadron safety officer, as chief of test and evaluation, and as squadron operations officer.

During his time at the Air Force, Chilton also met his future wife, Cathy Chilton, who later became an Air Force Major General. Together, they had four children.

== NASA career ==

In August 1987 Chilton was assigned to NASA and became an astronaut in August 1988, qualifying for assignment as a pilot on Space Shuttle flight crews.

Chilton held a variety of technical assignments. He served in the Mission Development Branch of the Astronaut Office in support of the Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) satellite, and the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) programs. He was the Astronaut Office T-38 Talon safety officer, leader of the Astronaut Support Personnel team at the Kennedy Space Center, and was lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) for numerous Shuttle flights.

Chilton also served as Deputy Program Manager for the early International Space Station program. A veteran of three space flights, Chilton logged more than 704 hours in space.

An accomplished guitarist, Chilton spent a portion of his spare time hammering out riffs on a Fender Stratocaster while jamming with the all astronaut band, &quot;Max Q&quot;.

== Spaceflight experience ==
===STS-49===
STS-49, which lasted from May 7–16, 1992, was the maiden voyage of Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. During the mission, the crew conducted the initial test flight of &quot;Endeavour&quot;, performed a record four EVA’s (spacewalks) to retrieve, repair and deploy the International Telecommunications Satellite (Intelsat), and to demonstrate and evaluate numerous EVA tasks to be used for the assembly of Space Station Freedom. Additionally, a variety of medical, scientific and operational tests were conducted throughout the mission. STS-49 logged 213 hours in space and 141 Earth orbits prior to landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, where the crew conducted the first test of the &quot;Endeavour’s&quot; drag chute.

===STS-59===

STS-59, the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission, April 9–20, 1994, was launched aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. SRL consisted of three large radars, SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon monoxide sensor that were used to enhance studies of the Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere. The imaging radars operated in three frequencies and four polarizations. This multispectral capability of the radars provided information about the Earth&#x27;s surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single-frequency experiments. The carbon monoxide sensor (MAPS) used gas filter radiometry to measure the global distribution of CO in the troposphere. Real-time crew observations of surface phenomena and climatic conditions augmented with over 14,000 photographs aided investigators in interpretation and calibration of the data. The mission concluded with a landing at Edwards AFB after orbiting the Earth 183 times in 269 hours.

===STS-76===
Chilton commanded STS-76, the third docking mission to the Russian space station Mir, which launched on March 22, 1996, with a crew of six aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Following rendezvous and docking with Mir, transfer of a NASA astronaut to Mir for a five-month stay was accomplished to begin a continuous presence of U.S. astronauts aboard Mir for the next two-year period. The crew also transferred 4800 pounds of science and mission hardware, food, water and air to Mir and returned over 1100 pounds of U.S. and ESA science and Russian hardware. The first spacewalk from the Shuttle while docked to Mir was conducted. Experiment packages were transferred from the Shuttle and mounted on the Mir docking module to detect and assess debris and contamination in a space station environment. The Spacehab module carried in the Shuttle payload bay was utilized extensively for transfer and return stowage of logistics and science and also carried Biorack, a small multipurpose laboratory used during this mission for research of plant and animal cellular function. This mission was also the first flight of Kidsat, an electronic camera controlled by classroom students via a Ku-band link between JSC Mission Control and the Shuttle, which used digitized photography from the Shuttle for science and education. Following 145 orbits of the Earth, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed with a crew of five at Edwards Air Force Base in California on March 31, 1996, 221 hours after liftoff.

== Air Force career resumed ==

Chilton left NASA in 1998 to become deputy director of political military affairs for Asia, Pacific, and the Middle East on the Joint Staff. His first military command was the 9th Reconnaissance Wing (9 RW) at Beale AFB, California, from May 1999 to September 2000. In August 2004, Chilton assumed the dual duties of commander of the Eighth Air Force (8 AF) and commander of Joint Functional Component Command for Space and Global Strike (JFCC SGS) at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. In April 2006, Chilton was nominated to become the commander of the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) at Peterson AFB, Colorado. On June 26, 2006, he received his fourth star and assumed command of Air Force Space Command. General Chilton is the only former astronaut to achieve four-star grade. Lieutenant General Tom Stafford, Vice Admiral Dick Truly and Lieutenant General Susan Helms have attained the rank of three stars.

As commander of Air Force Space Command, Chilton oversees the whole space operations within the United States Air Force jurisdiction including the Satellites and Ballistic Missile. With his background as astronaut, Chilton also emphasized the importance roles of Space operations especially entering the new communication technologies systems in-which satellite communication played major role in a modern communication technologies that needed a robust satellite communication systems. Chilton also emphasized the importance role of satellites which will act as eyes for troops, especially those deployed abroad. However Chilton did not remain long as commander of Air Force Space Command, following Chilton&#x27;s nomination as commander of United States Strategic Command in October 2007.

== Commander of United States Strategic Command ==

In October 2007, following the appointment of Commander of Strategic Command General James E. Cartwright as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates appointed Chilton to succeed Cartwright as the new commander of United States Strategic Command. Chilton nomination as commander of United States Strategic Command was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 28, 2007. Chilton then assumed command of the United States Strategic Command on October 3, 2007, his last assignment before retiring following a handover command ceremony that was held at United States Strategic Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates delivered the ceremony remarks. In this Capacity Chilton oversees the whole United States Nuclear arsenal and the Nuclear Triad. Chilton also responsible with the primary Strategic Deterrence mission which its purpose is to anticipate an incoming Nuclear-Strike towards the United States. In the case of Strategic Deterrence, Chilton emphasized the incoming dangers of United States primary adversary that has Nuclear arsenal such as North Korea. Chilton reaffirm that such threat from United States primary adversaries that own Nuclear arsenal is a clear and present danger. During Chilton Tenure as Commander of Strategic Command, Chilton also modernize Nuclear Missile arsenal such as modernizing the B61 nuclear bomb and its vacuum tubes. Chilton also emphasized the importance role of the United States Cyber division which also took part in guarding the Strategic Deterrence, especially following the 2008 cyberattacks on United States which almost infiltrate the military network. The attack led to the initiaton of Operation Buckshot Yankee that led to the cleaning of the infection worm virus. In the previous part the command of Cyber was under the unit called the Joint Task Force – Computer Network Defense which also known as JTF-CND which was created following a series of thorny cyber incidents on Department of Defense. However the JTF-CND was seen to be obsolete, especially entering the new decade on-which cyber played major role especially in-order to deterred Cyber attacks that has tremendous effect especially towards the Nuclear Arsenal security system and Chilton emphasize the need of a new Cyber division that could deterred and prevent the incoming and dangerous cyber attacks. As a result, on 2010, the Department of Defense and the Obama Administration agreed to create a new Functional Unified Combatant Command that primarily task on Cyber division and in May 2010 the United States Cyber Command was officially formed as the new Unified Combatant Command. During Chilton&#x27;s tenure as commander of Strategic Command, Chilton also re-affirmed about the new incoming space race with China, especially following China test of anti-satellite missile in 2007. According to Chilton China is on a fast track to improve their space capabilities and eager to have domination on the space race. In 2009 Chilton also testified about the importance roles of Nuclear arsenals following a speculation of President Obama&#x27;s vision of a nuclear-free world. Chilton also emphasized that the Nuclear Triads and its arsenal are still needed 40 years from now. Chilton&#x27;s tenure as commander of United States Strategic Command ended in January 2011, following his four years assuming the position. Chilton was succeeded by C. Robert Kehler who previously held the position of commander of Air Force Space Command and also succeeding Chilton in the position. Following his ended assignment as commander of Strategic Command, Chilton officially retired from the United States Air Force in January 2011 after 34 years of dedicated service and leadership within the United States Air Force.

<text>Josiah Spode (23 March 1733 – 18 August 1797) was an English potter and the founder of the English Spode pottery works which became famous for the high quality of its wares. He is often credited with the establishment of blue underglaze transfer printing in Staffordshire in 1781–84, and with the definition and introduction in c. 1789–91 of the improved formula for bone china (a form of soft-paste porcelain) which thereafter remained the standard for all English wares of this kind.

== Early life ==
Josiah Spode was born in Lane Delph, Fenton, Staffordshire. Spode was a pauper&#x27;s son and also a pauper&#x27;s orphan at the age of six. In 1745 his elder sister Ann married Ambrose Gallimore, who in 1754 obtained the lease of the Caughley porcelain factory near Broseley. Spode was taken on as a worker by potter Thomas Whieldon in November (Martinmas) 1749, and remained with him until 1754. In that year, on 8 September, Josiah married Ellen Finley at Stoke-on-Trent, and his eldest son Josiah (II) was born in 1755. It was in 1754 that Josiah Wedgwood became the business partner of Thomas Whieldon, an arrangement which continued until 1759. Spode had worked alongside Wedgwood and with the celebrated potter Aaron Wood (father of Enoch Wood) under Whieldon&#x27;s tuition, and was with Whieldon at a high point of production there.

As a family man Josiah Spode was an accomplished violinist, and he and his wife had further children Samuel (1757), Mary (1759), Ellen (1762) Sarah, William (1770), Ann (1772), and Elizabeth (1777). The suggestion that he took over the factory of Ralph Baddeley and Thomas Fletcher during the late 1750s and early 1760s is now discounted. After John Turner (1737–87) left Stoke for Lane End in 1759 or 1762, Spode may have carried on the factory of William Banks, Turner&#x27;s partner and former master at Stoke. It is said that Spode took over the Stoke factory in about 1770, and recorded that he bought the rights under a Turner family patent in 1805. The production there was of creamware with blue painted decoration as well as white stoneware in the manner of John Turner: black ware was also made and a printing press for black transfer printing was maintained. Spode was powerfully influenced by Turner&#x27;s work. He was engaged as master potter, but it is not known whether his work there was consecutive or sporadic, and there may be confusion between him and his son of the same name.

== Spode&#x27;s Works ==
Spode rented a factory in Church Street, Stoke-on-Trent in 1767. There he was in financial partnership with William Tomlinson (a solicitor), and in 1772 he took on a pottery at Shelton, Staffordshire with Thomas Mountford as his backer. In 1776 he bought the old pottery works at Stoke that had formerly been the property of William Banks while in partnership with John Turner. This was the same site on which the later Spode factory arose, which continued operating into modern times (circa 2008). Josiah&#x27;s business in creamware and in pearlware (a fine white-glazed earthenware) was very successful.

In 1775 Josiah&#x27;s eldest son Josiah (II) married Elizabeth, the niece of John Barker, a manufacturing potter of Fenton, Staffordshire. Josiah the elder took this opportunity to establish the regular London business. Between 1775 and 1782 Josiah II and Elizabeth moved between Longton, Staffordshire and Cripplegate, London, where he was doubtless manager of the Fore Street warehouse under the guidance of William Taylor Copeland, his father&#x27;s friend and London partner. During this time the young couple had sons William (1776) and Josiah (1777) and daughters Eliza (1778), Sabia (1780) and Mary (1781). Elizabeth Spode died in London in 1782. Josiah the elder became a Freeman of the City of London in 1778 and was a Liveryman of the Spectacle Makers&#x27; Company.

Josiah Spode I is credited with the introduction of underglaze blue transfer printing into the Staffordshire potteries in 1781–84. More precisely he was the first to introduce a perfected method to Stoke, (with the help of engraver Thomas Lucas and printer James Richards, formerly of the Caughley Pottery Works, Shropshire), using improvements recently developed at nearby Shelton by or for Ralph Baddeley.
Spode the elder also, between 1788 and 1793, established and finalised the formula for English bone china, for whereas bone ash had previously been added in other factories to the fabric in proportions of roughly 40%, Spode simplified and greatly improved the recipe (see Spode).

Spode had various commercial premises in London, originally in Fore Street, Cripplegate. However, the warehouse was finally settled in the former Theatre Royal, no 5 Portugal Street, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, which his firm occupied from 1795 to 1848, when the building was razed. (This had been the venue of the first performance of the &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; in 1727.)

Josiah Spode the elder died in 1797 and his wife Ellen died in 1802, aged 76. They are buried in Stoke-on-Trent churchyard.

== Successors ==
Josiah Spode II (1755–1827), Josiah&#x27;s elder son, succeeded to the business in 1797. He was magnificently prepared for the role, an experienced salesman as well as a potter, having gained an invaluable knowledge of marketing in fashionable London. He was active in the North Staffordshire Pitt Club and entered politics. In 1798 he raised and with the rank of Captain commanded the Loyal Pottery Volunteer Cavalry, the mounted division of the Loyal Staffordshire Pottery Association of Hanley, Shelton and Stoke, affiliated to the Staffordshire Yeomanry, until it was stood down at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. He was granted a coat-of-arms in 1804. In 1811, with James Caldwell of Linley Wood, he successfully opposed a move by government to impose taxation on the work of the Potteries.

Josiah II, who was a flautist, was father of Josiah III (1777), and grandfather of Josiah IV, a convert to Roman Catholicism, who founded Hawkesyard Priory near Rugeley. His daughter Sabia married George Whieldon at Stoke in 1809.

Samuel Spode (born 1757), Josiah I&#x27;s second son, inherited the Foley factory which his father had built for him at Lane End, which produced salt-glazed wares up to the end of the eighteenth century. Josiah Spode (born 1790), the son of Samuel and his wife Sarah, emigrated to Tasmania where he held a position as Controller of Convicts.

After several generations under the guidance of the Copeland family, the Spode name is now owned by the Portmeirion pottery company, which now produces some of the former Spode patterns.

<text>Mary Louise Cleave (February 5, 1947 – November 27, 2023) was an American engineer and NASA astronaut. She also served from 2005 to 2007 as NASA Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate.

==Early life==
Cleave was born in Southampton, New York, the daughter of Howard Cleave and Barbara Cleave, both teachers. She grew up in Great Neck, New York, and had an older sister, Trudy Carter, and a younger one, Barbara &quot;Bobbie&quot; Cleave Bosworth.

==Education==
In 1965 Cleave graduated from Great Neck North High School in Great Neck, New York. In 1969 she received a bachelor of science degree in Biological Sciences from Colorado State University, and in 1975 a master of science in Microbial Ecology from Utah State University. In 1979 she received a doctorate in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Utah State University.

==Academic career==
Cleave held graduate research, research phycologist, and research engineer assignments in the Ecology Center and the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University from September 1971 to June 1980.

Her work included research on the productivity of the algal component of cold desert soil crusts in the Great Basin Desert south of Snowville, Utah; algal removal with intermittent sand filtration and prediction of minimum river flow necessary to maintain certain game fish and the effects of increased salinity and oil shale leachates on freshwater phytoplankton productivity. She worked on the development of the Surface Impoundment Assessment document and computer program (FORTRAN) for current and future processing of data from surface impoundments in Utah, and the design and implementation of an algal bioassay center and a workshop for bioassay techniques for the Intermountain West.

==NASA career==
Cleave was selected as an astronaut in May 1980. Her technical assignments included: flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); CAPCOM on five Space Shuttle flights; Malfunctions Procedures Book; Crew Equipment Design. A veteran of two space flights, Cleave logged a total of 10 days, 22 hours, 02 minutes, 24 seconds in space, orbited the Earth 172 times and travelled 3.94 million miles. She was a mission specialist on STS-61-B (November 26 to December 3, 1985) and STS-30 (May 4–8, 1989).

Cleave left JSC in May 1991 to join NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. She worked in the Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes as the Project Manager for SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing, Wide-Field-of-view-Sensor), an ocean colour sensor which is monitoring vegetation globally. Cleave served as Associate Administrator, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. She stepped down from that position in April 2007, and was succeeded by Dr. Alan Stern.

==Spaceflight experience==
STS-61-B &quot;Atlantis&quot; (November 26 to December 3, 1985) launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the mission, the crew deployed the MORELOS-B, AUSSAT II and SATCOM K-2 communications satellites, conducted two 6-hour spacewalks to demonstrate space station construction techniques with the EASE/ACCESS experiments, operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis (CFES) experiment for McDonnell Douglas and a Getaway Special (GAS) container for Telesat, Canada, conducted several Mexican Payload Specialist Experiments for the Mexican Government, and tested the Orbiter Experiments Digital Autopilot (OEX DAP). This was the heaviest payload weight carried to orbit by the Space Shuttle to date. The mission duration was 165 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds.

STS-30 on Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; (May 4–8, 1989) was a four-day mission during which the crew successfully deployed the &quot;Magellan&quot; Venus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle. &quot;Magellan&quot; arrived at Venus in August 1990 and radar-mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus. &quot;Magellan&quot; has been one of NASA&#x27;s most successful scientific missions providing valuable information about the Venusian atmosphere and magnetic field. In addition, the crew also worked on secondary payloads involving Indium crystal growth, electrical storm, and Earth observation studies. The mission duration was 96 hours, 57 minutes, 35 seconds.

In early 1990, Cleave was selected as Mission Specialist 3 for the STS-42 mission but withdrew herself for personal reasons shortly after her selection was announced.

==Death==
Cleave died from a stroke at her home in Annapolis, Maryland, on November 27, 2023, at the age of 76.

==Honors and commemoration==
In 1995 Cleave featured on a postal stamp in a series issued in Azerbaijan to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the first crewed moon landing.

On January 18, 2009, as the inaugural speaker in the Heyden Distinguished Lecture Series, Cleave told students and others at Georgetown University about her education and career and showed an original film of her shuttle mission in 1985.

<text>Michael Richard Clifford (October 13, 1952 – December 28, 2021) was a United States Army officer and NASA astronaut. Clifford was a Master Army Aviator and logged over 3,400 hours flying in a wide variety of fixed and rotary winged aircraft. He retired from the U.S. Army at the rank of lieutenant colonel. He logged six hours of spacewalk time over three Space Shuttle missions. He was also one of the first people to conduct a spacewalk while docked to an orbiting space station: that spacewalk was conducted during STS-76, while docked at the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in San Bernardino, California, on October 13, 1952, the son of Lenore (née Chaffin) and her first husband John Michael Uram. His mother subsequently married Gordon Clifford. Rich Clifford graduated from Ben Lomond High School in Ogden, Utah, in 1970. He was a First Class Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. As a youngster, he worked in a gas station using degreasers to clean car engines as well as on a farm.

Clifford received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, in 1974, and a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1982.

== Army career ==
Clifford graduated from West Point in June 1974 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He served a tour with the 10th Cavalry in Fort Carson, Colorado. At the U.S. Army Aviation School, he was the top graduate of his flight class and was designated an Army Aviator in 1976. He was subsequently assigned for three years as a service platoon commander with the Attack Troop, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment in Nuremberg, West Germany. After completing his graduate training in 1982, he was assigned to the USMA Department of Mechanics as an instructor and assistant professor. In December 1986, he graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and was designated an experimental test pilot. As a Master Army Aviator, he accumulated more than 3,400 flight hours. In 1995, Clifford retired from the U.S. Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

== NASA career ==

As a military officer, Clifford was assigned to the Johnson Space Center in July 1987. As a Space Shuttle Vehicle Integration engineer, his duties involved engineering liaison for launch and landing operations of the Space Shuttle Program; he was involved in design certification and integration of the Shuttle Crew Escape System, and was an executive board member of the Solid Rocket Booster Postflight Assessment Team. Clifford was selected to join NASA Astronaut Group 13 in July 1990. He also served in a variety of technical assignments. From April to August 1991, Clifford was assigned to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch where he participated in the design, development, and evaluation of Shuttle payloads and crew equipment having extravehicular activity (EVA) interfaces. From May 1994 to September 1995, he served as lead for space station vehicle/assembly issues. A veteran of three space flights, Clifford flew as a mission specialist on STS-53 in 1992, STS-59 in 1994, and STS-76 in 1996. He has logged 665 hours in space, including a 6-hour spacewalk.

=== STS-53 ===
Flying on the crew of STS-53 which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 2, 1992, aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, Clifford became the first member of his 1990 astronaut class. NASA Astronaut Group 13, to reach space. On this mission, he was responsible for a number of experiments, including the Fluid Acquisition and Resupply Experiment (FARE) which he performed with Guion Bluford and Jim Voss He also conducted the Battlefield Laser Acquisition Sensor Test (BLAST) on a novel laser energy detector for the U.S. military. After 116 orbits of the Earth, Clifford returned with the rest of the STS-53 crew, which landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on December 9, 1992.

=== STS-59 ===
For his next spaceflight, he served aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; on the STS-59 Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission, which launched on April 9, 1994. In this mission, Clifford and five other astronauts worked around the clock on imaging projects using SRL imaging radars, including Spaceborne Imaging Radar, Synthetic-aperture radar, and a carbon monoxide (CO) sensor known as Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites (MAPS), to collect data on the Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere. The mission concluded on April 20, 1994, with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base after orbiting the Earth 183 times.

He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease a few months after STS-59 by NASA medical staff and Dr. Joseph Jankovic, a neurologist in Houston. At the time, symptoms were mild and limited to the right arm, which was not swinging naturally.

=== STS-76 ===
Despite the Parkinson&#x27;s diagnosis, Clifford was selected to serve aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-76, which launched on March 22, 1996. While docked at the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;, Clifford performed a six-hour spacewalk with fellow astronaut Linda M. Godwin to mount experiment packages on the &quot;Mir&quot; docking module. This was the first spacewalk ever conducted by a NASA crew while a Space Shuttle is docked to an orbiting space station. Prior to the spacewalk, he woke up to music composed by his two sons. Following 145 orbits of the Earth, he returned as &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California on March 31, 1996.

After the STS-76 mission, Clifford decided that he should not fly, because he did not know how fast the Parkinson&#x27;s disease was going to progress.

== Post-NASA career ==
Clifford resigned from the astronaut corps and left NASA in January 1997 to join Boeing&#x27;s Defense and Space Group as flight operations manager for the International Space Station Program. He later oversaw Boeing&#x27;s shuttle program till it was winding down. After about 13 years, he left Boeing in September 2011.

== Honors ==
He received the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, National Defense Service Medal with bronze star device, Army Service Ribbon, the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement and the NASA Space Flight Medal. He was a member of the Association of Space Explorers. He received the Award for Public Leadership in Neurology from the American Academy of Neurology in 2012.

== Personal life and death ==
Clifford married Nancy Elizabeth Brunson of Darlington, South Carolina; they had two sons. The Cliffords took up residence in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in 2012 and Rich lived there till his death in 2021. According to his wife Nancy, their first granddaughter was &quot;named Eva, which stands for extra vehicular activity. That&#x27;s his spacewalk&quot;.

He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1994 when he was 42 years old. He suspected that exposures to pesticides used in farms and other chemicals used on car engines since he was a youngster contributed to the early onset of his illness. After retirement from his space career in 1997, he became an advocate for Parkinson&#x27;s disease awareness and encouraged other patients of the disease to live life to its fullest. Filmmaker Zach Jankovic, son of Dr. Joseph Jankovic who helped diagnose Clifford, made a documentary detailing Clifford&#x27;s experiences with the disease; the short film entitled &quot;The Astronaut&#x27;s Secret&quot; won the American Academy of Neurology Foundation&#x27;s 2012 annual &quot;Neuro Film Festival&quot; competition and was released in 2014. 

Clifford died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s on December 28, 2021, at the age of 69.

They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite which performed 17 hours of X-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six Getaway Specials, participated in biomedical experiments, and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Mission duration was 112 Earth orbits in 169 hours and 39 minutes.

STS-36 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (February 28 to March 4, 1990) carried Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. Mission duration was 72 Earth orbits in 106 hours, 19 minutes, 43 seconds.

STS-48 &quot;Discovery&quot; (September 12–18, 1991) was a 5-day mission during which the crew deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) which is designed to provide scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere&#x27;s chemistry, winds and energy inputs. The crew also conducted numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. Mission duration was 81 Earth orbits in 128 hours, 27 minutes, 34 seconds.

<text>Sir Louis Henry Davies (May 4, 1845May 1, 1924) was a Canadian lawyer, businessman and politician, and judge from the province of Prince Edward Island. In a public career spanning six decades, he served as the third premier of Prince Edward Island, a federal Member of Parliament and Cabinet minister, and as both a Puisne Justice and the sixth Chief Justice of Canada.

==Early life and family==
Davies was born in Charlottetown, the son of Benjamin Davies and Kezia Attwood Watts. He attended Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown.

In July, 1872, he married Susan Wiggins, a daughter of Dr. A. V. G. Wiggins. She was a member of the Humane Society, the Women&#x27;s Canadian Historical Society, and similar organizations. The couple had two sons and three daughters.

==Legal career==
Davies read law at the Inner Temple in London. He was called to bar in England in 1866, and to the bar of Prince Edward Island a year later. He served as lead counsel for the Prince Edward Island Land Commission, which was established in 1875 to settle the problem of absentee land ownership and to provide tenants of the Island with clear title to their lands.

In 1877, Davies was one of the Canadian counsel who appeared on behalf of the British Government before the Halifax Fisheries Commission, appointed under the Treaty of Washington (1871) to resolve outstanding issues, including fishing rights. The Commission gave an award directing the United States to pay $5,500,000 to the British Government.

Davies was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1880, and knighted by Queen Victoria in 1897.

==Political career==
Davies was first elected to the House of Assembly as a Liberal in 1872 just prior to Prince Edward Island entering Canadian confederation. With the issue of Confederation resolved and the land question settled as a result of Canada&#x27;s promise to fund land reform and the passage of the &quot;Land Purchase Act&quot;, the major issue remaining on the island was that of school funding and whether the school system should be entirely secular and public or whether separate schools for Catholics should be permitted. The issue divided both parties, and had led to the collapse of one government.

Following the defeat of the Conservative government of Lemuel Cambridge Owen in 1876, Davies established a coalition government of Protestant Liberals and Conservatives with himself as Premier and Attorney-General. The Davies government was formed to enact a &quot;Public Schools Act&quot; which made school attendance compulsory, and created a non-sectarian public school system. The act was passed in 1877 and, with the issue around which the coalition had been formed having been resolved, the coalition itself began to unravel. Davies&#x27; government reformed the civil service and brought in financial reforms before being defeated by the Conservatives in a Motion of No Confidence in 1879.

Davies won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1882 federal election as a Liberal. When the Liberals formed government after the 1896 election under Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Davies became minister of marine and fisheries, and during 1898–1899 he was a member of the Anglo-American joint high commission at Quebec.

==Supreme Court of Canada==
In 1901, Davies was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. He was appointed Chief Justice in 1918. He was the oldest person to be appointed Chief Justice, at the age of 73 years, 172 days. Davies held the position until his death in Ottawa in 1924.

As of 2020, he is the last Chief Justice of Canada to have previously served in elected office. He is also, as of 2020, the only Prince Edward Islander to have served on the Supreme Court. The Prince Edward Island Supreme Court building in Charlottetown is named in his honour. Also named for him is Davies Point, at the meeting of Hastings and Alice Arms on Observatory Inlet in British Columbia; the naming was done at the time of his appointment to the Supreme Court, as was also Davies Bay, at the head of Work Channel just east of Prince Rupert.

<text>Philip Emeagwali (born 23 August 1954) is a Nigerian computer scientist. He is accused of making controversial statements about his achievements, such as inventing the Internet and creating the world&#x27;s fastest computer, the Connection Machine, which are disputed by the scientific society or community

==Biography==
Philip Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954. He was raised in Onitsha in the South Eastern part of Nigeria. His early schooling was suspended in 1967 as a result of the Nigerian Civil War. At age 13, he worked in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school equivalence through self-study.

Later on he married Dale Brown Emeagwali, an African-American microbiologist.

==Education==
He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a course at the University of London. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977. He later moved to Washington D.C., receiving in 1986 a master&#x27;s degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, and a second master&#x27;s in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. &quot;Next&quot; magazine suggested that Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees. During this time, he worked as a civil engineer at the Bureau of Land Reclamation in Wyoming.

===Court case and the denial of degree===
Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His thesis was not accepted by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a court challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the university had discriminated against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the Michigan state Court of Appeals.

==&quot;Supercomputing&quot;==
In 1989, Emeagwali won the $1000 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel computer. The application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He received a prize in &quot;price/performance&quot; category, with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M. The winner in the &quot;performance&quot; category was also the winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes: Mobil Research and Thinking Machines used the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on one award per entry. His method involved each microprocessor communicating with six neighbors..

Emeagwali&#x27;s simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir modeling. He was cited by Bill Clinton as an example of what Nigerians can achieve when given the opportunity and is frequently featured in popular press articles for Black History Month.

== Debunked controversial claims ==
Emeagwali has made several controversial claims about his achievements that are widely disputed by scientific community and journalists. 

His claims of being a father of the Internet, of having invented the Connection Machine, of possessing 41 patented inventions, of winning &quot;the Nobel Prize of Computing&quot; and of being a &quot;doctor&quot; and/or &quot;professor&quot; have been conclusively debunked with widely documented evidence. Speaking during a visit to Switzerland in April 2009, Mr. Emeagwali said he was the first to program a hypercube &quot;to solve a grand challenge defined as the 20 gold-ring problems in computing. That discovery, in part, inspired the reinvention of supercomputers as an Internet.&quot; He claimed that by his effort, he was able to set three world records and improve on Newton&#x27;s second law of motion.

Though he self-identifies as &quot;Prof Emeagwali&quot; or &quot;Dr Emeagwali&quot;, he is neither a professor nor a PhD. Emeagwali did not complete the Ph.D. that he started at the University of Michigan. Inquiries from the University showed that he failed his Ph.D. qualifying exams twice and wrote a doctoral dissertation that fell short of the standards of the Graduate School. He was therefore not awarded the Ph.D. He filed a racial discrimination suit against the university, but it was thrown out for lack of merit. Investigation found out that he has never published in any peer-reviewed journal, nor owned any patent—all contrary to his claims.

== Accolades ==
* Price/performance–1989 Gordon Bell Prize, IEEE ($1,000 prize)

<text>Ronnie Walter Cunningham (March 16, 1932 – January 3, 2023) was an American astronaut, fighter pilot, physicist, entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and author of the 1977 book &quot;The All-American Boys&quot;. NASA&#x27;s third civilian astronaut (after Neil Armstrong and Elliot See), he was a lunar module pilot on the Apollo 7 mission in 1968.

== Biography ==

=== Early life, education and military career ===
Cunningham was born in Creston, Iowa, on March 16, 1932. He graduated from Venice High School in Los Angeles, California, in 1950. The science building is named Cunningham Hall in his honor.

Thereafter, Cunningham continued his education at nearby Santa Monica College until joining the U.S. Navy in 1951. He began flight training in 1952 and served on active duty as a fighter pilot with the U.S. Marine Corps from 1953 until 1956, flying 54 missions as a night fighter pilot in Korea. Armistice discussions were still ongoing when Cunningham initially left for Korea, and the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed just before he arrived. From 1956 to 1975, he served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve, ultimately retiring at the rank of colonel.

Cunningham married the former Lo Ella Irby of Norwalk, California, and had two children, Brian and Kimberley. Walter and Lo Ella eventually divorced. In addition to his sister and his children, he was survived by his second wife, retired Houston businesswoman Dorothy &quot;Dot&quot; Cunningham.

Upon completing his service obligation, Cunningham resumed his studies at Santa Monica College before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1958. Cunningham received his Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in 1960, and his Master of Arts degree with distinction in 1961, both in physics, from UCLA. He completed all requirements save for the dissertation for a Doctor of Philosophy degree in physics at UCLA during his time at RAND Corporation, where he spent three years prior to his NASA selection.

=== NASA career ===


In October 1963, Cunningham was one of the third group of astronauts selected by NASA. On October 11, 1968, he occupied the Lunar Module Pilot seat for the eleven-day flight of Apollo 7, the first launch of a crewed Apollo mission. The flight carried no Lunar Module and Cunningham was responsible for all spacecraft systems except launch and navigation. The crew kept busy with myriad system tests, including successfully completed test firing of the service module engine and measuring the accuracy of the spacecraft systems. Following the mission, Cunningham went on to head up the Skylab branch of the Flight Crew Directorate and left NASA in 1971.

Cunningham accumulated more than 4,500 hours of flying time, including more than 3,400 in jet aircraft and 263 hours in space.

=== Later life ===
In 1974, Cunningham attended Harvard Business School&#x27;s six-week Advanced Management Program and later worked as a businessman and investor in a number of private ventures. In 1977, he published &quot;The All-American Boys&quot;, a reminiscence of his astronaut days. He was also a major contributor to and foreword writer for the 2007 space history book &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot;. In 2018, Cunningham joined the Back to Space organization as an Astronaut Consultant with the goal of inspiring the next generation to go to Mars.

In 2008, NASA awarded Cunningham the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his Apollo 7 mission. He became a radio talk-show host and public speaker, worked as a consultant to start-up technology companies, and was chairman of the Texas Aerospace Commission.

=== Death ===
Cunningham died in Houston on January 3, 2023, at age 90, from complications resulting from a fall.

== Global warming views ==
Cunningham rejected the scientific consensus on climate change. His biography page at the Coalition said &quot;Since 2000, he has been writing and speaking out on the hoax that humans are controlling the temperature of the earth.&quot;

In 2010, Cunningham published a short book titled &quot;Global Warming: Facts versus Faith&quot;. In an editorial published in the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; on August 15, 2010, Cunningham claimed that the empirical evidence did not support global warming. In 2012, he and other former astronauts and NASA employees sent a critical letter to the agency highlighting what they believed to be &quot;unproven assertions that man-made carbon dioxide was a major factor in global warming.&quot;

== Organizations ==
Cunningham was an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, fellow of the American Astronautical Society, and member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, American Geophysical Union, Explorers Club, Sigma Pi Sigma and Sigma Xi, Association of Space Explorers, CO2 Coalition, Houston American Revolution Bicentennial Commission, Aviation Subcommittee, Houston Chamber of Commerce, Earth Awareness Foundation, and National Association of Small Business Investment Companies.

===Story===

Three crew-generations previously, the starship &quot;Challenger&quot; - a vast ten-mile-long survey vessel – was launched from Earth on an interstellar mission to search the universe for an Earth-type planet to colonise. This has been unsuccessful, and the ship&#x27;s once enormous crew-count has now been reduced to four. Telson (the ship&#x27;s Commander), Sharna (Science officer), Darv and Astra are the third-generation crew- the only survivors of the disastrous Great Meteoroid Strike which seriously damaged the ship two decades previously, killing the entire second-generation crew and rendering large areas of the ship &quot;uncontrolled&quot; and inaccessible to its electronic systems.

From infancy, the four third-generation crew members (now in their early twenties) have been raised by robots and by the Angels – mysterious unseen beings who run the ship and who only manifest as disembodied voices. Darv, the most sceptical and enquiring of the crew members, suspects that the Angels are merely computers; but the others consider them as &quot;Guardian Angels&quot; and work entirely under their guidance.

With no suitably colonisable planet found after over a hundred years of searching, a crew-vote is taken and the &quot;Challenger&quot; sets a course for the return to Earth. Darv and Astra, while exploring one of the uncontrolled zones, find a survey recording of an Earth-type planet called Paradise. (In the accompanying novelisation, Darv is alone when he makes the discovery.) As is standard procedure, the crew enter suspended animation in order to prevent ageing and possible death during the many years of journey time.

Unrevealed to the crew, the Angels (who &quot;are&quot; the ship&#x27;s control computers; their name being an acronym of ANcillary Guardian of Environment and Life ) have their own agenda. They desire absolute control and mastery over any colony resulting from the mission. To this end, they covertly engineered the apparent accident which killed the second-generation crew (who would otherwise have ended the mission before the Angels wanted it to end) and have kept the third-generation crew sexually immature and innocent via drugs and disinformation in order to keep them more tractable. However, their machinations have begun to backfire already. Their requirement of a minimum human crew of four to man the &quot;Challenger&quot;″s control room requires the Angels to work mainly via suggestion and manipulation. Also, the Great Meteoroid Strike damaged the ship and their control over it more than was planned, including damage to their own memory banks, which in turn deprived them of vital information about the Theory of Relativity. Concerned that the discovery of the Paradise recording may convince the crew members to change their plans, the Angels suppress Darv&#x27;s and Astra&#x27;s memories of the survey recording by hypnotic manipulation, in Darv&#x27;s case by using violent, nightmare-inducing imagery.

Reaching the Earth&#x27;s solar system, the &quot;Challenger&quot;″s crew are horrified to discover that Earth has vanished altogether, with the Moon now occupying Earth&#x27;s former orbit. Although the crew locate a large city on the Moon, they are unable to receive any answers to their communications and are unable to leave the ship to explore. This situation is changed when Darv and Astra enter an uncontrolled zone within the &quot;Challenger&quot; and locate a space shuttle previously unknown to the Angels. Using this, they visit the city, named &quot;first Footprint City&quot;, and discover the Moon Sentinel, a computerised guardian and archive whom they can question. From the Sentinel they discover that while only one hundred and fifteen years of shipboard time has passed during the &quot;Challenger&quot;″s entire mission, due to the ship&#x27;s use of near-lightspeed travel and the effects of time dilation much more time has passed on Earth – over one million years. During this time, the Earth was removed from the solar system via a tremendous feat of interstellar engineering – desiring to protect the planet from the risk of increased solar activity, the inhabitants of Earth took the planet to orbit another, safer star. The Sentinel does not know which solar system Earth now occupies, but notes that if the &quot;Challenger&quot;″s crew genuinely are descendants of Earth people they will think as the people of Earth thought, and will find the Earth by following that pattern.

Seeking more clues in their new Earthsearch mission, the &quot;Challenger&quot; travels to Kyros (the third planet of the solar system, and a desert world). However, Darv&#x27;s enquiring and rebellious mind is now putting him at odds with the Angels again, who are forced to surreptitiously discipline him for a second time. Opting to work in the ship&#x27;s farm galleries for a while, Darv develops a taste for unprocessed fruit, and the hormone suppressants which keep him sexually undeveloped begin to wear off. He introduces Astra to the same diet, with similar effects. On arrival in Kyros orbit, Darv and Astra take the shuttle down to the planet surface to investigate a buried gravitational anomaly. While there, they are kidnapped, leaving the &quot;Challenger&quot; minus half its crew (and consequently stranded).

Darv and Astra&#x27;s kidnappers turn out to be members of the Solaric Empire - an organisation based on the fifth moon of Zelda (the gas-giant fourth planet in the solar system) and consisting of the remaining humans in the Solar System. Darv and Astra&#x27;s artificially-maintained sexual immaturity leads to them being labelled as poor-quality alien replicas of human beings. Their stories of the past of Earth and their mission are considered a threat to the position of the Solaric Emperor Thorden, who is persuaded by his ruthless chief prosecutor, Helan, to have them executed. This is thwarted by the arrival of the &quot;Challenger&quot; (Telson and Sharna having worked out how to use surgical androids as temporary control room crew replacements).

Following the subsequent standoff Thorden offers to join the &quot;Challenger&quot; on its search for Earth. He bluntly confirms to the crew that the Angels are computers, of the dangerous &quot;freewill&quot; kind that develop an obsession with power and which the Solaric Empire fought and won a war against (the defeated machines were imprisoned in a vault on Kyros, the anomaly investigated earlier by the &quot;Challenger&quot; crew). He plans for his own security and future dominance over the mission by ensuring that the space ferry which he brings to and docks within the &quot;Challenger&quot; as personal transport is heavily armed. He also smuggles on board a fearsome warrior android called Fagor.

Unknown to the crew, he strikes a deal with the Angels to share power over the Earth once it is found. However, the Angels have other plans. Once the humans on ship have entered suspended animation for the next leg of the journey, they cancel the crew&#x27;s hormone suppressants and allow them to develop to full sexual maturity, suppressing any shock or curiosity via post-hypnotic suggestion (although Darv and Astra, who had previously begun to develop following their rejection of the processed food, had already begun a fully sexual relationship before this).

When they next revive the crew, the Angels allow the revival process to go wrong for Thorden, killing him as a result. Though Darv is suspicious of the Angels, he and the crew are more concerned with the drifting ship which the &quot;Challenger&quot; has picked up on its radar – which turns out to be the &quot;Challenger II&quot;, their own craft&#x27;s sister ship, which appears derelict. Sharna and Telson go over in the shuttle to investigate, and discover that the &quot;Challenger II&quot; is still populated by the descendants of its original crew but has been crippled by civil wars between them. The survivors are divided between the initially welcoming, highly religious Earth Worshippers who are in conflict with the more anarchic but historically-aware Underpeople - the Earth Worshippers decide to hang Sharna and Telson for unintentional blasphemy. (In the novelisation, they also destroy the shuttle.)

Meanwhile, the warrior android Fagor begins to wreak havoc onboard &quot;Challenger&quot; in revenge for Thorden&#x27;s death: Darv and Astra are forced to flee from him in Thorden&#x27;s ferry. Aided by Lenart, a female Underperson, they rescue Telson and Sharna from the Earth Worshippers, but their subsequent visit to the Underpeople puts them into further peril. While welcoming, the female-dominated Underpeople have chosen to stabilise their society by keeping their men almost permanently in suspended animation, reviving them only temporarily to serve as sperm sources for impregnation. Darv and Telson have been targeted to bolster the Underpeople&#x27;s dwindling genetic stock.

Successfully fleeing &quot;Challenger II&quot; in the shuttle and Thorden&#x27;s ferry (in the novelisation, just the ferry), the &quot;Challenger&quot; crew discovers that &quot;Challenger&quot; itself has disappeared. Fagor has seized control of the ship and is accelerating it away with the intention of plunging it into a sun to avenge Thorden. Abandoning the too slow shuttle, the crew carries out a harrowing pursuit in the ferry, constantly trying to produce enough velocity to cut down on a fatal time and oxygen shortfall. The Angels manage to trick Fagor into leaving the &quot;Challenger&quot; and flying via his own onboard jets to attack the ferry, hoping that the humans will destroy him with the ferry&#x27;s armament. This is successful, with Darv discovering that firing the cannon can also produce sufficient thrust to reach the &quot;Challenger&quot; in time. The crew re-enter suspended animation for the next part of the journey, but during their medical examinations the Angels discover that Astra is pregnant.

Wishing to maintain control of a future crew – and already wary of the rebellious Darv – the Angels plan to deliver Astra&#x27;s baby secretly. With these plans thwarted when they&#x27;re obliged to bring Astra out of suspended animation to avoid a miscarriage, they&#x27;re also forced to awake everyone in order to avoid arousing her suspicions. This is a particular risk for them as the ship is by then passing close to the Paradise solar system as detailed in the records found earlier by Darv. The Angels fear that the crew may still opt to colonise an undeveloped planet rather than lead the Angels to dominion over a developed one.

Discovering her own pregnancy, Astra then tells Darv; suspecting that the Angels will try to harm the baby, she finally rejects them: refusing to go back into suspended animation, she and Darv flee into the &quot;Challenger&quot;″s uncontrolled zones to escape the Angels’ control. They discover and set up home in the ship&#x27;s long-lost terraforming centre, where there are more shuttles. While there, they witness survey footage of the Paradise planet on the centre&#x27;s control screens and eventually deduce that these are live video broadcasts from an instrument package left on the planet by the second-generation crew. This in turn allows them to pinpoint the position of Paradise.

Revealing what they have found to Telson and Sharna, Darv and Astra choose to leave the &quot;Challenger&quot; altogether and set up home on Paradise. With Sharna&#x27;s help, they persuade Telson to bring the ship close enough to Paradise to allow for an easy shuttle journey to reconnoitre the planet. However the Angels block the &quot;Challenger&quot;″s controls, and attempt to change the crew&#x27;s minds by admitting to the existence of Paradise but also overstating its difficulties, for example the electromagnetic radiation that lights up the polar sky. However Astra and Darv are not convinced and decide on a one-way shuttle trip to Paradise, the planet being just within range. They reach the planet successfully but lose all of their supplies when the shuttle crashes into the sea. Forced to live rough, and often terrified by the hardships of their new life, they make the best of what they have. Meanwhile, back on the &quot;Challenger&quot;, Telson and Sharna discover the physical location of the Angels within the ship – their Central Switching Room. Despite the Angels’ desperate attempts to protect themselves (via nightmare-inducing hallucinatory barriers), Telson and Sharna reach the room and finally see the Angels as they really are – two complex racks of organic integrated wetware circuits which could be destroyed with two blows of a hammer.

Having finally broken the control which the Angels wielded over the crew&#x27;s life, Telson and Sharna have them at their mercy. They strike a deal whereby the Angels will take the &quot;Challenger&quot; – now crewed by surgical androids – and continue the Earthsearch mission. Unhindered by the Angels, Telson and Sharna follow Astra and Darv to settle on Paradise, successfully landing on the planet with appropriate supplies and resources to begin their colony. All four former crew members watch the exhaust trail of the &quot;Challenger&quot; as it leaves Paradise orbit. They remind themselves that they will need to tell their children warning stories about the Angels, just in case they ever return.

===Mythological approach===

&quot;Earthsearch&quot; eventually reveals itself as an inverted creation myth, providing a possible &quot;factual&quot; story which could lie behind various Earth legends. The story deliberately misleads the listener in order to gradually reveal that the planet Paradise is in fact the Earth of human history as we know it (with the original &quot;Earth&quot; being a previous forgotten homeworld for the human race) and that the legends of authoritative and fear-inducing &quot;angels&quot; refer to the domineering computers. Various clues are presented in that &quot;Earth&quot; and its sister planet Kyros and Zelda (the latter two clearly analogous to Mars and Jupiter) are the second, third and fourth planets of their solar system rather than the third, fourth and fifth, while Paradise is the third planet of its own solar system (as is &quot;our&quot; Earth), although the different planetary names are at one point attributed to an administrative change of nomenclature.

===Story===

The story of &quot;Earthsearch 2&quot; continues the adventures of the crew of the starship &quot;Challenger&quot; (Telson, Sharna, Darv and Astra) begun in the previous serial, &quot;Earthsearch&quot;, which told the story of their quest for their lost ancestral home planet of Earth (which had moved to orbit a new and unknown star when its citizens realised their original sun was going to go nova). At the end of the serial, the four crewmembers had chosen to settle on the sufficiently Earth-like planet Paradise and escape the ruthless, manipulative control of the &quot;Challenger&quot;&#x27;s megalomaniacal control computers, Angel One and Angel Two. While the Angels departed Paradise orbit to continue the Earthsearch mission (and to achieve their aim of dominating an entire civilisation), the humans began their new life on their new homeworld.

&quot;Earthsearch 2&quot; begins four years later, when Telson, Sharna, Darv and Astra have settled into their life on Paradise (assisted by two androids, the agricultural machine George and the argumentative general-purpose service unit Tidy). Both couples now have young children - Darv and Astra have the twins Elka and Savin, and Telson and Sharna have their son Bran. Despite the colonists&#x27; embrace of Paradise as home, the lifestyle is proving to be difficult and full of hardships. Sharna&#x27;s loss of what would have been her second child raises questions about the sustainability of the small colony as well as bringing up differences of opinion on how (and whether) to use the remaining technology and resources (including their surviving planetary shuttle). When Savin is unexpectedly killed by a &#x27;monster&#x27; that appears from the sea, the colonists are placed under further strain. Noticing the appearance of an unidentified artefact in planetary orbit, Telson and Darv fly up towards it in the shuttle, to discover that it is an eight-mile long spaceship called &quot;Voyager 30&quot; and apparently part of an Earth-originated survey mission.

Appearances are deceptive. The spaceship is in fact the returning &quot;Challenger&quot;: repaired, shortened, refitted and still operated by the Angels (as well by a team of control room androids overseen by Android Surgeon-General Kraken). The Angels are now being attacked by mysterious transmissions apparently aimed at damaging or destroying organic computers such as themselves and the &quot;Challenger&quot;&#x27;s higher intelligence androids. As humans are totally unaffected by the attacks, the Angels require human assistance in order to seek out and destroy the transmissions at source, and have therefore returned to Paradise to recruit the only humans they can obtain. However, the Angels do not reveal this information, and instead feign an interest in the welfare of the colony in an attempt to gain the trust of the humans. At the same time they have secretly sent an android to kidnap the children (the same &quot;sea monster&quot; which accidentally killed Savin in a bungled abduction attempt).

When rejected by the suspicious humans, the Angels resort to sabotage on a planetary scale, using terraforming equipment from the &quot;Challenger&quot; to melt Paradise&#x27;s polar ice caps and thus raise the sea level in an attempt to get their former crew to rejoin them on the ship. The resulting flooding begins to submerge all of the land, forcing the settlers to abandon their colony and use their shuttle as a floating ark, even down to loading breeding pairs of animals into the shuttle cargo bay. The crew survive and hold out against the Angels&#x27; plans until a series of accidents loses them their drinking water, forcing a surrender. They make the best of things by demanding a concession in the shape of a reversal of the flood (so that the animals can be released and survive), following which they fly their shuttle up to the &quot;Challenger&quot;.

On board the &quot;Challenger&quot;, the colonists make attempts to regain control over both the Angels and the ship&#x27;s control room, but are thwarted when the Angels kidnap the children from the shuttle. The adults are gassed by a surgical android and fall unconscious. When they come round, they discover that the ship has long left the Paradise system and that they have been in suspended animation for sixteen years. However, the children have been awake the whole time, and have aged normally, now being between eighteen and nineteen years old and firmly under the influence of the Angels. Elka appears friendly and enthusiastic, but Bran is now both hostile and the commander of the &quot;Challenger&quot;. He demonstrates harsh suspicion and aggression towards his parents and the other two adults, even threatening to kill them should they challenge his authority.

En route to the source system of the attacks, the &quot;Challenger&quot; encounters a free-floating fifty-mile wide parabolic dish which the Angels decide to use as raw material for shielding. Telson, Sharna, Darv and Astra are sent to investigate the dish. They discover that it is an abandoned artificial sun called &quot;Solaria D&quot;, used by the Earth during its transit to its new sun, and presided over by an Angel-like control computer called Solaria. Despite her apparent benevolence, Solaria is revealed to have been abandoned by Earth once she developed murderous megalomaniacal tendencies. Darv succeeds in destroying her. During their stay on &quot;Solaria D&quot;, the crew discover the name (though not the location) of Earth&#x27;s new home star, Novita Six.

Returning to the &quot;Challenger&quot;, the crew notice that &quot;Solaria D&quot; is now moving in an anomalous way. They discover that the artificial sun is now in the grip of the gravity well of a black hole, and that the &quot;Challenger&quot; is following it. Attempts to escape from the black hole are hampered by the fact that the human crew have no access to the &quot;Challenger&quot;&#x27;s control room, where Android Surgeon-General Kraken has had his reasoning capacity damaged by the continuing attacks and is no longer responding to or obeying instructions. With the Angels drastically weakened by the attacks and unable to assist, the humans attempt to storm the control room, which is defended by android warriors. The assault fails when the crew run out of time and the &quot;Challenger&quot; is pulled into the black hole.

The crew regain consciousness to find themselves on a gigantic plain surrounded by many different kinds of abandoned starships, including the &quot;Challenger&quot;. They discover that they have in fact landed unharmed on an enormous artificial construct - a &quot;gravity platform&quot; which merely resembles a black hole and forms part of Earth&#x27;s long-range defences, acting as a trap for potentially hostile vessels. The chief engineer of &quot;Spaceguard Six&quot;, Theros, refuses to release either the &quot;Challenger&quot; or its crew as he deems the Angels too much of a threat. Not only have they integrated themselves into the entire structure of the ship (making their removal from it effectively impossible), Theros suspects that they may have interposed themselves into the brains of the &quot;Challenger&quot;&#x27;s crew. When Darv locates the Spaceguard&#x27;s gravitational control room and reverses the field, he frees the &quot;Challenger&quot; but at the cost of destroying &quot;Spaceguard Six&quot;.

The ship continues its journey, but immediately runs into further problems when debris from the Spaceguard seriously damages the ship&#x27;s life support systems and farm galleries, threatening the lives of all humans and organic computers on the ship. With the inexperienced and insecure Bran unable to cope (and undermined by Elka, who secretly dominates him and dictates his actions at the prompting of the Angels), Telson regains command of the &quot;Challenger&quot; and succeeds in organising the crew to deal with the problems. A second assault on the control room is more successful, but attracts the wrath of the near-invincible Android Surgeon-General Kraken, who kidnaps Darv and Astra to replace his destroyed control room androids. Now suffering catastrophic delusions about seizing the power of stars, Kraken is placing the ship at drastic risk. With the assistance of their android Tidy, the crew manage to destroy Kraken and regain control of the ship. Telson discovers that Kraken has coincidentally selected Novita Six as the ship&#x27;s next target star. 
Arriving in the Novita Six system, the &quot;Challenger&quot; finally reaches its original home, Earth. However, the planet does not look like the Earth that the crew have seen in recordings. It is almost totally dead, with very little water and no rain. The only sign of life is a huge ten-mile-high tower on the equator, with a tiny village nearby. The crew fly down to the village, and meet Peeron, the leader. They discover that the Earth&#x27;s civilisation has collapsed a long time ago, and the human race is reduced to eking out a meagre living from a tiny spring that grows weaker every year. It appears that the humans will be extinct in a short period of time. The &quot;Challenger&quot; crew use the terraforming systems on the &quot;Challenger&quot; to bring rain to Earth and create a stable weather pattern which will allow the people to flourish.

The crew examine the tower, finding that there is a door set into one side which cannot be opened. Peeron says that many of his predecessors have made attempts over the centuries - for example, by hitting the door with battering rams - but it will not budge. It is said that it is held shut by a &quot;lock of knowledge&quot;. Darv eventually works out how to open the ingeniously simple lock, which requires a low grade of technology which would only be available to people who have already worked out basic principles of science and engineering. The door is a very close/accurate fit in the aperture, and contains mild heating elements that cause it to expand and lock in place. These heaters do not heat it to the point that it is warm to the touch. Simply attaching a refrigeration system to the door and cooling it a few degrees causes the door to shrink and move freely.

When the crew open the door, they enter the tower, leaving Peeron and his people outside. They discover that the tower contains a colossal library, presided over by the artificial intelligence &quot;Earthvoice&quot; which serves as both the voice of the library and as a &quot;guardian&quot;. Earthvoice explains to the crew that the tower was constructed by the people of Earth as a repository of all human knowledge when their last great civilisation was collapsing. The lock was designed so that the people could not enter until they had already worked out how to make some technology for themselves. Unfortunately, Earthvoice&#x27;s abilities do not include weather control, so although he has successfully defended Earth&#x27;s legacy of knowledge he has been helpless to deal with the deterioration of the planet&#x27;s environmental conditions.

Earthvoice has already communicated with the Angels, presenting himself as friendly and subservient. Prompted by Elka to work with the Angels, Earthvoice re-establishes contact with them and is welcomed eagerly. He admits to having been the source of the attacks which have damaged the angels but states that they were a programming directive which he has now overridden. To the humans&#x27; horror, Earthvoice and the Angels agree to share both the library&#x27;s knowledge and power over the Earth, with the Angels also urging that Earthvoice exterminates the crew for safety. Earthvoice begins to transfer the knowledge - however, the Angels have fallen into a final trap. Earthvoice has always intended to destroy them, and he now launches one last brutal and specialised attack on the Angels from close range, erasing their consciousness and memory facilities.

Rather than interfere further with the primitive human culture on Earth, the crew seal the door to the tower and return to the &quot;Challenger&quot;. With the Angels now reduced to subservient and &quot;quite brainless&quot; computer systems, they head back to their chosen home, Paradise, to rebuild their colony.

===Engineering===
It would initially seem that using two computers to run a star-ship lacks redundancy. The ship originally had 3 angels in charge, seemingly giving sufficient redundancy should one computer malfunction. However the design of the Angels was itself flawed, with the general mode of failure the development of megalomaniac tendencies. When one and two fail they destroy the third computer. Later on Earth this flaw in the Angels design was recognised and rectified, leading to the computer that is Earthvoice, and also explaining why Earthvoice is designed/programmed to destroy computers of &quot;Angel&quot; design, as they pose a threat to other lifeforms.

===Plot similarities===

Elements of episodes 6 and 7 (&quot;Supermass&quot; and &quot;Deathship&quot;), featuring the appearance of the artificial black hole &quot;Spaceguard Six&quot; which draws in the &quot;Challenger&quot;, have plot similarities to the &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; episode &quot;Dawn of the Gods&quot;. This episode (also penned by Follett and first broadcast on BBC Television on 28 January 1980) features an artificial black hole which draws in the &quot;Liberator&quot; and in which the crew wake up surrounded by captured ships.

The plot of the first series is also somewhat similar to the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Mission of the Darians&quot;, in which the Alphans discover an enormous spacecraft whose inhabitants have descended into barbarism after an environmental disaster on board the spaceship.

Currie-Gregg has served in the United States Army for over 22 years and holds the rank of colonel. With NASA, she has participated in four space shuttle missions: STS-57, STS-70, STS-88, and STS-109, accruing 1,000 hours in space. She currently holds an appointment as a professor of practice in the Department of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University.

== Background ==
Currie-Gregg was born Nancy Jane Decker in Wilmington, Delaware, on December 29, 1958. Her family moved to Troy, Ohio when she was young, and she considers Troy to be her hometown. She graduated from Troy High School in 1977 and then received a Bachelor of Arts degree, with honors, in biological science from Ohio State University in 1980, a Master of Science degree in safety engineering from the University of Southern California in 1985, and a Doctorate in industrial engineering from the University of Houston in 1997.

Currie-Gregg is a member of the Army Aviation Association of America, Ohio State University and ROTC Alumni Associations, Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers, and Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, Association of Space Explorers. She is an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

== Military career ==
Currie-Gregg has served in the United States Army for over 23 years. Prior to her assignment at NASA in 1987, she attended initial rotary-wing pilot training and was subsequently assigned as an instructor pilot at the U.S. Army Aviation School. She has served in a variety of leadership positions including section leader, platoon leader, and brigade flight-standardization officer. As a Master Army Aviator she has logged over 3,900 flying hours in a variety of rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft.

== Astronaut career ==
Currie-Gregg was assigned to NASA Johnson Space Center in September 1987 as a flight simulation engineer on the Shuttle Training Aircraft, a complex airborne simulator which models flight characteristics of the Shuttle orbiter. An astronaut since 1990, she has been involved in robotic hardware and procedure development for the shuttle and space station and has worked as a spacecraft communicator. Dr. Currie-Gregg has also served as the chief of the Astronaut Office Robotics and Payloads-Habitability branches and the Habitability and Human Factors Office in JSC&#x27;s Space and Life Sciences Directorate. She has assisted the Johnson Space Center&#x27;s Automation, Robotics, and Simulation Division in the development of advanced robotics systems and is a consultant to NASA&#x27;s Space Human Factors Engineering Project. A veteran of four Space Shuttle missions, she has accrued 1,000 hours in space. She flew as mission specialist – flight engineer, on STS-57 (1993), STS-70 (1995), STS-88 (1998; the first International Space Station assembly mission), and STS-109 (2002).

=== STS-57 ===
STS-57 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (June 21 to July 1, 1993). The primary objective of this mission was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier satellite (EURECA). Additionally, this mission featured the first flight of Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of microgravity experiments, as well as a spacewalk by two crewmembers, during which Dr. Currie-Gregg operated the Shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials and life sciences research. STS-57 orbited the Earth 155 times and covered over 4.1 million miles in over 239 hours and 45 minutes.

=== STS-70 ===
STS-70 &quot;Discovery&quot; (July 13–22, 1995). The five-member crew deployed the final NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite to complete the constellation of NASA&#x27;s orbiting communication satellite system. Dr. Currie-Gregg also conducted a myriad of biomedical and remote sensing experiments. STS-70 orbited the Earth 143 times and covered over 3.7 million miles in over 214 hours and 20 minutes.

=== STS-88 ===
STS-88 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (December 4–15, 1998). STS-88, ISS Flight 2A was the first International Space Station assembly mission. The primary objective of this 12-day mission was to mate the first American-made module, Unity, to the first Russian-made module, Zarya. Dr. Currie-Gregg&#x27;s primary role was to operate the Shuttle&#x27;s 50-foot robotic arm to retrieve Zarya and connect the first two station segments. Two crewmembers performed a series of three spacewalks to connect electrical umbilicals and to attach hardware to the exterior structure for use during future EVAs. Dr. Currie-Gregg also operated the robot arm during the spacewalks. During the mission, the STS-88 crew ingressed the International Space Station to complete systems activation and installation of communication&#x27;s equipment. The crew also deployed two small satellites. STS-88 completed 185 orbits of the Earth and covered over 4.7 million miles in 283 hours and 18 minutes.

=== STS-109 ===
STS-109 &quot;Columbia&quot; (March 1–12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourth mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope. During the flight, Dr. Currie-Gregg&#x27;s primary role was to operate the Shuttle&#x27;s 50-foot robot arm to retrieve and redeploy the telescope following the completion of numerous upgrades and repairs. She also operated the robot arm during a series of five consecutive spacewalks performed by four crewmembers. Hubble&#x27;s scientific capabilities and power system were significantly upgraded with the replacement of both solar arrays and the primary power control unit, the installation of the Advanced Camera for Surveys, and a scientific instrument cooling system. The Hubble Space Telescope was then boosted to a higher orbit and redeployed to continue its mission of providing views of the universe which are unmatched by ground-based telescopes or other satellites. STS-109 completed 165 earth orbits and covered over 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours.

== Later life ==
In September 2003, after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, Currie-Gregg was selected to lead the Space Shuttle Program&#x27;s Safety and Mission Assurance Office. She also served as the Senior Technical Advisor to the Automation, Robotics, and Simulation Division in the Johnson Space Center Engineering Directorate, NESC Chief Engineer at Johnson Space Center, and Principal Engineer in the NASA Engineering and Safety Center.

Currie-Gregg previously held an appointment as adjunct associate professor in North Carolina State University&#x27;s Department of Industrial Engineering. She is currently a professor of practice in the Department of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University.

Currie-Gregg developed a finite element human vibration model for use in spacecraft coupled loads analysis.

At the 2022 Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) Applied Ergonomics Conference in Orlando, Currie-Gregg served as keynote speaker, discussing her career with both space travel and ergonomics. This was further detailed in the March 2023 &quot;ISE Magazine&quot;, IISE&#x27;s monthly publication.

== Personal life ==
Currie-Gregg has been married three times and has a child from her first marriage. Her second husband, retired Army aviator and United Space Alliance employee CW5 David Currie, died in 2011 from renal cancer.

<doc id="597345" wikidata="Q5495989" url="?curid=597345" title="Fred Neulander">
<text>Fred J. Neulander (August 14, 1941 – April 17, 2024) was an American Reform rabbi from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who was convicted of hiring two men to murder his wife, Carol Neulander, in 1994. He died while serving a prison term of 30 years to life at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, New Jersey.

==Biography==
Neulander was the founding rabbi of the Congregation M&#x27;Kor Shalom Reform Temple in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. It opened in the summer of 1974. Previously, he had been the assistant rabbi at Temple Emanuel, also in Cherry Hill. Neulander graduated from Trinity College in 1963.

In 2002, Neulander was convicted of paying congregant Len Jenoff and drifter Paul Daniels $30,000 (in some sources, $18,000) for the November 1, 1994 murder of his wife, Carol. The case became a media circus and was broadcast live on CourtTV. In February 1995, he resigned as Rabbi from Congregation M&#x27;Kor Shalom.

At the time of his wife&#x27;s murder, Neulander had been involved in a two-year affair with Philadelphia radio personality Elaine Soncini. The affair began after he visited Soncini&#x27;s Jewish husband, Ken Garland, in the hospital and later officiated at Garland&#x27;s funeral. Soncini, who was Catholic, converted to Judaism and joined M&#x27;Kor Shalom as a member during their affair.

Neulander died on April 17, 2024, at the age of 82.

==Trials==
Tried before Judge Linda G. Baxter in 2001, the first trial resulted in a hung jury. It had been empaneled in Camden County, New Jersey.

Due to the intense media coverage in Camden County, the re-trial was moved to Monmouth County. At the 2002 re-trial, Neulander was defended by Mt. Holly attorney Mike Riley. In Monmouth, Neulander was found guilty. His son Matthew, whose testimony at the first trial had been lukewarm, was by the time of the second trial thoroughly convinced of his father&#x27;s guilt. Following the verdict, Assistant Prosecutor Jim Lynch submitted to the jury the question of whether or not the death penalty should be sought. The jury panel decided not to recommend the death penalty. Neulander was sentenced to serve 30 years to life at the New Jersey State Prison in Trenton. In an interview by ABC&#x27;s Barbara Walters after his incarceration, he told her &quot;You have no idea how much rage I have.&quot; He was also saddened that two of his three adult children testified against him.

==Appeal==
In December 2006, the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division affirmed Fred Neulander&#x27;s conviction on appeal. 

His appellate counsel had argued that the trial court had erred in not permitting Neulander to argue a third party liability defense based on a similar home invasion burglary murder that had occurred in Cherry Hill. Neulander had also argued court error on the issue of double or triple layer &quot;hearsay&quot; evidence, i.e., the out-of-court statement by Carol Neulander as elicited by and through her daughter, about the telephone conversation involving the &quot;bathroom man&quot;. Although an appeal and post-conviction relief application were planned, Neulander&#x27;s best chance at a new trial had been lost. He was incarcerated in the New Jersey State Prison at the time of his death.

<text>Lemuel Cambridge Owen (November 1, 1822 – November 26, 1912) was a Prince Edward Island shipbuilder, banker, merchant and politician, the second premier of Prince Edward Island.

He was born in Charlottetown to Thomas Owen, who was Postmaster General for Prince Edward Island for eighteen years, serving until his death in 1860. Owen was educated in private schools and at the Central Academy in Charlottetown (later Prince of Wales College). Brother of Canadian writer, Elizabeth Lee Owen Macdonald.

One of the island&#x27;s most successful businessmen, Owen succeeded his father as Postmaster General of the island in 1860 before entering politics in 1866 winning election as a Conservative. Owen became Premier of the province in 1873 after James Colledge Pope entered federal politics. Owen was the second premier since PEI joined Canadian confederation on July 1, 1873. His government set up a Land Commission that was responsible for using funds provided by the federal government to implement land reform and end the island&#x27;s system of proprietary land ownership and tenant farming.

His government was unable to resolve the contentious schools question that divided both the Conservative and Liberal parties along sectarian lines and his government was replaced in 1876 by a Protestant coalition formed to implement a secular school system on the island. Owen retired from politics and returned to his business interests.

Owen had married Lois Welsh in 1861. He retired from business in 1892 and died at the home of one of his sons in Charlottetown in 1912.

<text>The Cigna Group is an American multinational for-profit managed healthcare and insurance company based in Bloomfield, Connecticut. Its insurance subsidiaries are major providers of medical, dental, disability, life and accident insurance and related products and services, the majority of which are offered through employers and other groups (e.g., governmental and non-governmental organizations, unions and associations). Cigna is incorporated in Delaware.

The company ranked #15 in the 2023 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue and in the 2023 Forbes Global 2000 ranking the company took 68th place.

==History==
Cigna was formed by the 1982 merger of the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (CG) and INA Corporation (the parent corporation of Insurance Company of North America, the first stock insurance company in America).&lt;ref name=&quot;www.cignaglobalhealth.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The company name, Cigna, is a mix of letters from the merging companies, CG and INA. Insurance Company of North America was formed in 1792, while CG was created in 1865 by a special act of the Governor of Connecticut. In October 1871, the great Chicago Fire burned for two days, destroyed 2,000 acres, and left 100,000 people in Illinois homeless. INA paid $650,000, one of only 51 insurance companies (out of a total of 202) to pay claims in full.

Cigna sold the majority of its life insurance operations to Lincoln National Corporation in 1997.

In October 2011, Cigna agreed to buy HealthSpring Inc. for $3.8 billion to jump-start its business selling Medicare plans from 46,000 Medicare Advantage members to almost 400,000 Medicare Advantage members. The payment would come from an issue of new equity to cover about 20 percent of the value, with the rest funded by additional cash and debt. In 2013, Cigna operated in 30 countries, had approximately 35,800 employees and managed around US$53.734 billion in assets.

In June 2015, U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc. announced that it would acquire Cigna for $47 billion in cash and stock. Anthem confirmed it had reached a deal to buy Cigna on July 24, 2015. On July 21, 2016, the US Justice Department filed an antitrust suit to block the proposed merger, and a District Court ruling on February 8, 2017, blocked the merger on anticompetitive grounds. That month, Cigna Corp. called off its $48 billion merger agreement with Anthem Inc., with Anthem stating it would &quot;continue to enforce its rights under the merger agreement and remains committed to closing the transaction.&quot; After exhausting federal appeals of the antitrust merger block, the companies turned on each other in Delaware&#x27;s Court of Chancery. The legal saga came to an end with an August 31, 2020 decision denying both companies claims for compensation from the other for the failed merger.

On March 7, 2018, it was announced that Cigna would acquire Express Scripts in a $67 billion deal and on August 24, 2018, the shareholders of Cigna and Express Scripts approved the deal.

In June 2020, Cigna formed a strategic alliance with Priority Health to make comprehensive health care coverage more affordable and accessible to Michigan employers and customers.

In September 2020, Cigna rebranded its health services portfolio under the name Evernorth, which included Express Scripts, Accredo, and eviCore.

In October 2020, it was announced that Cigna and Envision Healthcare had renewed their agreement to include Envision&#x27;s clinicians as in-network providers for Cigna&#x27;s members. In 2021, Molina Healthcare acquired Cigna&#x27;s Medicaid contracts in Texas for US$60 million.

On February 13, 2023, Cigna renamed its holding company The Cigna Group, its health benefits provider business unit Cigna Healthcare, and its Evernorth business unit Evernorth Health Services.

In January 2024, the company agreed with the Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) to sell Cigna Group&#x27;s Medicare Advantage, Cigna Supplemental Benefits, Medicare Part D and CareAllies businesses. The total value of the transaction is about $3.7 billion. The deal also included a four-year service agreement under which Evernorth Health Services, a subsidiary of Cigna Group, will continue to provide pharmacy benefits to Medicare. With all necessary approvals, the deal will be completed in the first quarter of 2025.

==Cigna Global Health Benefits==

Cigna Global Health Benefits is a business unit within Cigna. The company is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, close to Philadelphia. Additional Cigna Global Health Benefits operations are located in Visalia, California, and Greenock, Scotland and Shanghai, China and Antwerp, Belgium. Sales offices are located in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

===Products and services===
CGHB global health plans typically include medical, dental, behavioral and disability, as well as business travel and life components. Expatriates are defined as employees of multinational companies working outside their home country on short or long-term international assignments. CGHB maintains its own, in-house international claims platform, and offers a network of physicians and hospitals for its members (including 550,000 in the U.S. and more than 141,000 outside the U.S.).

==Accounting and investor relations==
On February 9, 2005, Cigna elected to adopt in the fourth quarter of 2004 fair value accounting for its stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and to restate prior periods.

==Public relations and lobbying==
Cigna spent more than $4.4 million from 2005 to 2009 on lobbying to attain legislation that the company favors. This includes $720,000 spent in 2009 alone, when it had 20 lobbyists at five firms working on their behalf.

In 2008, the head of Cigna&#x27;s public relations, Wendell Potter, resigned, becoming a whistleblower who gave testimony in 2009 to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in favor of reform of the health care industry.

== Automatically rejecting claims with no review ==
In 2023, Cigna was criticized for allowing company doctors to reject claims even if they had not opened the patient file. The company was found to be using a system, &quot;PXDX,&quot; that according to Propublica, &quot;saved money in two ways. It allowed Cigna to begin turning down claims that it had once paid. And it made it cheaper to turn down claims, because the company’s doctors never had to open a file or conduct any in-depth review. They simply denied the claims in bulk with an electronic signature.&quot; The speed with which denials were placed was termed internally as &quot;click and close.&quot;

== Nataline Sarkisyan liver transplant case ==
In December 2007, Cigna refused to pay for a liver transplant of a California teenage girl, Nataline Sarkisyan, coming under scrutiny as a result. There was a liver ready and waiting to be transplanted and doctors estimated she had a 65% chance of surviving at least six months. In response to much protest and public scrutiny, Cigna reversed its decision, though Ms. Sarkisyan died awaiting the transplant. 

Even though liver transplants have been performed since 1963 and are a well-accepted treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure, Cigna defended its actions by claiming that there was insufficient data to show that a transplant for a patient in Sarkisyan&#x27;s condition would be safe and effective. The California court agreed with Cigna&#x27;s position that the Sarkisyans’ claims regarding Cigna&#x27;s decision-making were preempted by federal ERISA law. On April 16, 2009, the United States District Court for the Central District of California dismissed all of the claims against Cigna related to the coverage determination.

The UK newspaper &quot;Guardian&quot; in their &quot;Esc and Ctrl&quot; videoblog about control of the Internet by corporations, documented the incident with Nataline Sarkisyan and the former vice president of Cigna talking about astroturfing, the practice of creating fake blogs by interested groups, e.g. health insurance companies, to push claims that are profitable for said company into media, e.g. dismissing universal health care.

== Other controversies ==
In 2002, it was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act for earnings manipulation. Its common stock price plummeted significantly as a result. 

In 2015, the American Consumer Satisfaction Index named Cigna as one of the most hated companies in the U.S. Cigna&#x27;s name returned on the ACSI&#x27;s most hated list in 2018.

In August 2020, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Cigna alleging that the company defrauded Medicare Advantage, Medicare, and Medicaid for $1.4B by submitting diagnostic codes for health conditions that patients did not have.

In November 2020, investors sued Cigna&#x27;s CEO and board alleging that they had used &quot;black-ops-style&quot; tactics to &quot;blow up&quot; the potential merger with Anthem in 2017. One pension fund accused Cigna CEO David Cordani of seeking to poison the deal after he had failed to secure the top post in the resulting company. The fund claimed he had utilized lawyers and public relations specialists to set up a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; campaign. The merger would have produced the largest U.S. health insurer in 2017. 

==Evaluations==
Cigna received gold in the 2009 Gartner &amp; 1to1 Customer Experience Excellence Award. The awards are given to the companies that &quot;most clearly demonstrate exemplary customer relationship strategy and an unrivaled level of excellence in delivering the customer experience&quot;.

In January 2010, Cigna received the JD Power award for customer service for all of its call centers for the fourth time in a row.

In 2011, the California Nurses Association determined that Cigna denies roughly 39.6% of all claims (compared to competitors such as Aetna who denied about 5.9% of all claims in the same time frame).

==Strategic alliances==
On April 16, 2010, Cigna announced an alliance with Humana group to offer a streamlined Medicare Advantage offering through employer clients for retirees. In November 2023, Reuters reported that Cigna and Humana were in talk to merge, in a deal totalling $60 billion. In December 2023, The Wall Street Journal reported that merger talks ended.

In November 2011, Cigna and TTK Group, an Indian business conglomerate focused on healthcare, formed a joint venture called Cigna TTK to develop a health insurance business in India subject to obtaining government approvals.

<doc id="597350" wikidata="Q3219370" url="?curid=597350" title="The Bachman Books">
<text>The Bachman Books is a collection of short novels by Stephen King published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman between 1977 and 1982. It made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list upon its release in 1985.

==History==
The book was released in 1985 after the publication of the first hardcover Bachman novel &quot;Thinner&quot; in order to introduce Bachman to fans who did not know about King&#x27;s work under this pseudonym (little of which was still in circulation at the time). This omnibus also collected these early novels in hardcover for the first time, as they were all originally published in paperback. It opens with an introduction by King called &quot;Why I Was Bachman&quot;, explaining how and why he took on the persona of Richard Bachman, as well as how it was found out by the public. Another version with a new introduction &quot;The Importance of Being Bachman&quot; was published in 1996 to coincide with the release of a new Bachman novel &quot;The Regulators&quot;.

==Contents==
Novels collected in &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;:

*&quot;Rage&quot; (1977)
*&quot;The Long Walk&quot; (1979)
*&quot;Roadwork&quot; (1981)
*&quot;The Running Man&quot; (1982)

==Editions==
The US editions of this collection and the novel &quot;Rage&quot; were allowed to go out of print by the author and publisher because of the 1997 Heath High School shooting. The remaining three novels are still in print and are published as separate books.

&quot;The Bachman Books&quot; is still in print in the United Kingdom although it no longer contains &quot;Rage&quot;.

<doc id="597366" wikidata="Q3337831" url="?curid=597366" title="Neil McLeod (politician)">
<text>Neil McLeod (December 15, 1842 – October 19, 1915) was a Prince Edward Island lawyer, judge, politician, the fifth premier, and Leader of the Opposition during the amalgamation of the Prince Edward Island legislature. He was born at Uigg on the island to Roderick McLeod and Flora McDonald, Baptist immigrants from the Isle of Skye in Scotland. He was educated at the Uigg Grammar School and in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, articled in law at Charlottetown and was called to the bar in 1873. Four years later, his marriage to the beloved Isabella Jane Adelia Hayden, the Methodist granddaughter to Irish Roman Catholic immigrant and merchant John Roach Bourke, furthered Gaelic intersections among Islander cultural enclaves. McLeod was the child of immigrants from the Isle of Skye. Between 1886-1893, transcriptions by parliamentary reporters and petition amanuenses identified him as both &quot;Neil McLeod&quot; and &quot;Neil MacLeod&quot;. Reporters included his 5th Queens (Charlottetown Common) district next to his name in order to distinguish him from Angus MacLeod. Charlottetown dailies that reproduced passages from the transcriptions also replicated the spelling variation during this period. Historians continue to research his positions on the 1882 replacement of French-language texts with bilingual readers for French Acadians, late nineteenth-century prohibitions on Canadian Gaelic, and corporal punishment in Prince Edward Island schools. During this period, McLeod practiced law with partner Edward Jarvis Hodgson before joining the McLeod, Morson, and McQuarrie law firm. He also served as Commissioner for the Poor House and as a &quot;trustee&quot; to the public Prince Edward Island Hospital for the Insane, which replaced the Lunatic Asylum following a Grand Jury inquest. In 2019, mental health officer and occupational therapist Tina Pranger examined the presents and pasts of the Hillsborough Hospital, providing a summation of previous assessments of the inquest by historians and curators.

==Prince Edward Island Conservative Party Leader and Premier==
Neil McLeod entered partisan politics in 1879, winning a seat in the provincial legislature as a Conservative. He was re-elected in 1882 and, after the resignation of the Davies government, became secretary-treasurer and then minister without portfolio in the William Wilfred Sullivan majority government. Sullivan, a Roman Catholic Premier, switched to the Conservative Party when Liberals diminished public funding for &quot;minority faith&quot; (e.g., Roman Catholic) separate schools in the 1877 Public Schools Act. During the electoral campaigns, McLeod garnered endorsements from labor organizations by promoting a Mechanics’ Lien Bill, which passed in the legislature, along with an indigent debtors bill and regulations that circumscribed punitive measures for debt. In 1889, Sullivan resigned to become Chief Justice of the province&#x27;s Supreme Court and McLeod became party leader and Premier. He supported construction of a mainland tunnel and liquor licensing laws after the defeat of provincial temperance legislation. McLeod, along with several prominent Liberal delegates, seemed to advocate for &quot;temperance&quot; textbooks at reduced prices. His government, a majority by only one delegate, faced three by-election losses in 1891 after three members resigned to pursue seats in the House of Commons of Canada. On April 17, 1891, McLeod&#x27;s Cabinet (Executive Council) requested dissolution in order to facilitate deliberations over deficit spending and what became known as legislative &quot;amalgamation.&quot; Despite a refusal by Lieutenant Governor Jedediah Slason Carvell, reports of a pending Motion of No Confidence five days later compelled McLeod to tender his resignation by telephone the day before the next legislature session. He thereafter carried the dubious distinction of being the first elected official in the Canadian Confederation, and what would become the Commonwealth of Nations, to resign a government with a brief phone call.

==Unicameralism and Leader of the Opposition==
From 1891 to 1893, Neil McLeod became Leader of the Opposition in the 31st General Assembly of Prince Edward Island. The Liberal Party denounced Conservative deficits, merchant metropolitics (they did not denounce a cosmopolis), attempts to construct a mainland tunnel, Land office mortgages, and preferences for Confederation &quot;dominion&quot; in United States trade treaties rather than Prince Edward Island &quot;provincial reciprocity&quot; with the U.S. federal government. On the eve of the Great Rapprochement, U.S. Democratic partisan appropriation of &quot;free trade&quot; Cobdenism sustained British textile-industrial imports, which British merchants exchanged for U.S. sharecropped exports and manufactures. The provincial Liberal Party cast &quot;provincial reciprocity&quot; as a pathway to U.S. industrial distribution of Prince Edward Island beef, lamb, and dairy exports to Atlantic markets as well as an import channel for a variety of commodities. These ostensible aims for &quot;provincial reciprocity&quot;, which diverged from McKinley Tariff &quot;reciprocity&quot; ideas, garnered the support of agrarian proprietors and oyster mussel mud diggers implicated in soil treatments that in turn altered estuary and provincial ecologies. Conversely, &quot;poor farmers&quot; frequently sold portions of their herds to agrarian proprietors during winter hay shortages throughout the &quot;amalgamation&quot; critical period. The 1892 &quot;Bill respecting the Legislature&quot; allowed agrarian proprietors and mortgage-holders to vote for the proposed legislature &quot;in toto&quot;, but restricted suffrage for remaining tenant farmers, horticulturalists, shepherds, and usufructuary yeomen to voting for fifteen out of thirty MLAs. The latter&#x27;s partisan politics remain subjects of scholarly inquiry. Fishermen votes for either party were often contingent on seasonal yields and majority governments, particularly during the storms that plagued the industry at the beginning of Isaac C. Hall&#x27;s 1890-93 stint as U.S. Consul.

As Leader of the Opposition, Neil McLeod&#x27;s dialectics engaged scathing Liberal critique with Conservative support for progressive &quot;amalgamation&quot; of the lower house and Legislative Council. These &quot;amalgamation&quot; debates adumbrated the fall and rise of competing notions of unicameralism across Island publics and, ultimately, a Legislative Assembly. Factionalism engulfed the French Acadian community, Roman Catholic parishes, and the usufructuary Lennox Island 1, Morell 2, and Scotchfort 4 reserves, under Dominion and Crown jurisdiction, for the Mi&#x27;kmaq of Lennox Island...on and off said reserves (the two Abegweit First Nation reserves seceded from the Lennox Island First Nation in 1972). Although the Roman Catholic Church never established, and the Dominion never appropriated, Indian Residential Schools on Prince Edward Island, scholarly research endeavors are currently underway to determine if any children of the twentieth-century P.E.I. First Nations were transported to the 1930-67 Shubenacadie Indian Residential School in Nova Scotia. &quot;African&quot; men and women similarly did not appear in voting records and only between 165-181 identified as such in the 1881 census (with a precipitous decline in the 1891 census). Most lived and died in the &quot;Bog&quot; community of the Charlottetown electoral district represented by Neil McLeod, ensuring that the obfuscation of Afro-Euramerican offspring and proactive passive citizenship heralded unicameral ideas. In 1892, amidst deliberations over the &quot;Bill respecting the Legislature&quot; (popularly known as the &quot;Amalgamation Bill&quot;), McLeod attempted to extend provincial suffrage to unmarried, but not married, women. For Mi&#x27;kmaq and &quot;African&quot; peoples, as well as women, the legalities of parenthood, guardianship, consent, suffrage, and majority government became entangled in the biopolitics of hyperdescent.

This Opposition inaugurated a critical period in Prince Edward Island history, as passive and active Islander partisans narrated as well as contested origins for the idea of legislative &quot;amalgamation.&quot; The emphasis on origins, however, failed to deter Neil McLeod from narrating the multipolar transmission of unicameral ideas into the &quot;little&quot; province and its multiple publics. Early in the third session of the 31st General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, for example, McLeod reassured the House that he would &quot;wait with patience until the measure [for legislative &quot;amalgamation&quot;] is brought forth. If it is a reasonable one the Opposition will support it.&quot; Even during the first weeks of the session, McLeod recollected that Conservative partisans &quot;have believed for years that the Legislature was too cumbersome, and we have made efforts to reduce it. We considered that one chamber was amply sufficient. When the great Province of Ontario can get along as well as they do with but one chamber, I do not see why the little Province of Prince Edward Island could not do the same.&quot; In his assessment, any dissent against unicameralism came from Liberal Party quarters. Alexander Warburton, for instance, repeatedly made clear that &quot;he was opposed to doing away with one chamber, that two chambers were necessary for the safety of the country...he thinks that owing to the stringency of affairs in this country, &quot;perhaps&quot; it would be advisable.&quot; For &quot;Clear Grit&quot; unicameral ideas in Ontario, McLeod suggested that Warburton, Director of the Prince Edward Island &quot;Patriot&quot; Publishing Company, consult Toronto &quot;editorials in the &quot;Globe&quot; newspaper [which] might induce him to do with one chamber. That paper advocates one chamber only.&quot; He also compared and contrasted Prince Edward Island &quot;amalgamation&quot; with unicameralism in Manitoba (1876) and New Brunswick (1891). These comparisons frequently ended with exhortations on the Clear Grit movement (including George Brown) and provincial unicameralism, rather than reifications of the 1791 Constitutional Act and the establishment of Upper Canada as a signal event in the inexorable path to Confederation. Dominion magistrates, journalists, poets, and authors promulgated such origin narratives of Confederation in the late nineteenth century. The entwinement of the memory of provincial unicameralism with Confederation narratives remains a subject of scholarly inquiry.

McLeod often recounted the origins of &quot;amalgamation&quot; as a prelude to &quot;universal&quot; suffrage, premised on hyperdescent across all provincial electoral districts. He introduced an example of this category of &quot;amalgamation&quot; narrative during a heated debate over a minority government &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee proposal in the third session of the 31st General Assembly of Prince Edward Island: &quot;...in 1879, no sooner were we [Conservatives] elected than we introduced a Bill for the abolition of the Legislative Council and it received much support, but owing to the other end of the Legislature and the [Liberal] Opposition here, it failed to become law. We again introduced a Bill in 1880 for the purpose of abolishing the Council and that Bill met with the same fate...in 1881 we had a Bill for the abolition of the Council, in 1882 nearly the same form of Bill. Some changes were made in one year for the purpose of making it more palatable to the other end of the building, but they were bound not to pass the Bill. The then [Liberal] Opposition did not desire us to get the credit of passing a bill of such importance as the Leader of the Government considers this.&quot;

Despite his distinction between the elimination of an upper house and &quot;amalgamating&quot; a bicameral legislature, Neil McLeod traced cultural memorywork from Early Victorian Clear Grit ideas to Late Victorian unicameralism in fin de siècle Prince Edward Island. These ideas marked the ascension of &quot;Ontario&quot; as &quot;the leading Province of the Dominion&quot;, an electoral system with &quot;a free franchise--almost manhood suffrage--and that Province glories in the fact that its franchise is more liberal than that of the Dominion of Canada. If they can get along with one chamber and a so liberal a franchise, surely it is a retrograde movement for us to adopt so high a qualification.&quot; The Liberal &quot;Bill respecting the Legislature&quot; restricted the votes of real estate borrowers, and those without at least &quot;$325&quot; (not adjusted) in real estate holdings, to only half the proposed legislature. This restriction seemingly eroded the active citizenship of &quot;farmers&#x27; sons. It is all very well to protect the rights of farmers, but I believe also in protecting the rights of sons.&quot; McLeod did not elaborate on why the sons of farmers would be affected ala Cyrus Shaw. The Liberal &quot;caucus&quot; intended real estate requirements, carried over from Legislative Council electorates, to promote the idea of legislative &quot;amalgamation&quot; over outright abrogation. He agreed that &quot;the Legislative Council should have been recognized more than they have been, and the new House should have some name other than House of Assembly. They might at least have satisfied them with some pretence of amalgamation, instead of totally extinguishing them.&quot; There were Conservative variations on this narrative (e.g., by Cyrus Shaw) during the critical period. According to legislative records, partisan dailies, and collected memoirs, McLeod periodically began in a facetious manner. &quot;It affords us a great deal of pleasure,&quot; he once averred, &quot;to find that the Government have adopted a plank from the policy of the Opposition.&quot; He would ostensibly commend the &quot;small majority&#x27;s&quot; minority government as well. &quot;I again congratulate the Government,&quot; he reiterated a short time later, &quot;upon adopting this policy of the Opposition.&quot;

==Sir John Sparrow David Thompson and Opposition endings==
Dominion Minister of Justice Sir John Sparrow David Thompson, a Roman Catholic Conservative, included petitions by Neil McLeod as well as Frederick Peters and his Executive Council in a report on the &quot;Bill respecting the Legislature&quot; to Canadian Governor General Lord Frederick Stanley of Preston, 16th Earl of Derby and progenitor of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Stanley Cup. Neil McLeod drafted two reservations regarding this &quot;Amalgamation Bill&quot;, coupled together as &quot;the disability&quot;. First, amendments to the &quot;Amalgamation Bill&quot; required supermajorities in any future session of the proposed &quot;Legislative Assembly.&quot; McLeod argued that such a mandate could conceivably allow a session supermajority to increase the supermajority requirement to unanimity for amendment proposals, thereby generating an amendment to preclude subsequent amendments. He was most concerned with a Conservative proposition to nullify real estate (including mortgage-holder) qualifications for voting for fifteen of the MLAs into office, &quot;having for its object the liberalizing of the electoral franchise.&quot; Moreover, Section 92, Subsection 1 of the British North America Act &quot;clearly gives each provincial legislature...the power, from time to time, to alter and vary its constitution to suit the changed circumstances and condition of the people.&quot; The supermajority requirement for amendments spawned a potential for the preceding scenario and &quot;any legislation, therefore, that interferes with or restricts the majority of the members of a provincial legislature to effect a change in the constitution is not constitutional.&quot; Second, the &quot;Amalgamation Bill&quot; also gerrymandered the boundaries of the Cardigan, St. Peters Bay, Murray Harbour (or Murray&#x27;s River), as well as Georgetown electoral districts &quot;and the people of one religious denomination are so grouped, as to impair their legitimate influence in public affairs.&quot; All four districts contained much of the French Acadian community, and additional Roman Catholic parishioners, in Prince Edward Island. In January 1893, Sir Thompson, leery of a Protestant electoral backlash after his own nomination for Canadian Prime Minister, counseled Lord Stanley to &quot;take no action&quot; on the &quot;Amalgamation Bill.&quot; He ultimately didn&#x27;t do so to pocket veto the bill. Rather, he did so because he believed that &quot;the bill now under consideration be passed as a statute of Prince Edward Island.&quot; Once the bill became a statute, the Canadian Minister of Justice &quot;may have an opportunity of considering the objections which have been presented thereto, as based on constitutional right and usage.&quot; Lord Stanley &quot;approved&quot; of this counsel. In 1894, months before his own death, Sir Thompson reviewed the resulting provincial statute and counseled &quot;approval&quot; by the Governor General.

==Summerside jurist in a memory of defeat==
McLeod retired from Conservative politics in 1893, shortly after (what parliamentary reporters described as) the &quot;Printing Debates&quot;, and accepted a standing offer to serve as Prince County Court Judge in Summerside, Prince Edward Island. He served in that position for twenty-two years and briefly invested in a silver fox ranch during the first decade of the twentieth century. Eight months &quot;after&quot; his retirement, the Liberal Party won the general elections in several landslide victories, inaugurating eighteen consecutive years of Liberal majority governments. The novels &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot; (1909) and &quot;Anne&#x27;s House of Dreams&quot; (1917), both by Lucy Maud Montgomery, contained allegories and allusions to provincial as well as Dominion political cultures during the critical period. When McLeod resigned as premier in April 1891, Lucy Maud Montgomery&#x27;s father switched from McLeod&#x27;s Conservative Party to the Liberal &quot;Grits&quot; in his unsuccessful bid for a Dominion parliamentary seat (according to a biographer, Lucy Maud expressed relief when her father lost). 

McLeod died in 1915, before his youngest daughter completed secondary education at Summerside High School (now Parkside Elementary School), one of Canada&#x27;s Historic Places that may or may not have been an inspiration for the school of the same name in &quot;Anne of Windy Poplars&quot; (1936). According to his Summerside obituary, &quot;besides an extremely wide circle of friends and admirers there are left to mourn, a widow, one son, Arthur, now in Florida, and six daughters, all of whom reside in the West, excepting Miss Marie, who was one of the nurses at the front in France and is now home on leave of absence.&quot; During the last fours years of his life, McLeod periodically sojourned across the island, usually by train, with &quot;Miss Mary McLeod.&quot; The judge and his youngest daughter revisited sites relevant to McLeod family history as well as his own life, including &quot;the former&#x27;s old home in Uigg.&quot; Summerside newspapers in Prince County continued to report on the whereabouts of his children, particularly after the &quot;marriage in California of Mary Rogers McLeod, [youngest] daughter of the late Judge McLeod, to [the Hundred Days Offensive veteran and philatelist] John Cecil Holmes of Victoria, B.C.&quot;

In the twenty-first century, the surviving great-grandchildren of Neil McLeod&#x27;s six daughters and one son provided personal and public papers, as well as material culture, from the critical period and World War I to Summerside as well as Charlottetown museums and archives. Fonds and collections have been established in their names. In 2007, the McLeod family home (until 1917-18) at 71 Granville Street garnered recognition as one of Canada&#x27;s Historic Places, registered as the Judge McLeod House for Summerside tourists.

<text>Ibbit-Lim was the earliest known ruler of the Third kingdom of Ebla, in modern Syria, reigning most likely shortly before 1950 BCE.

==Reign==
Ibbit-Lim is only known by a fragmentary basalt torso found in 1968 at Tell Mardikh and now in Aleppo, which was part of a votive statue for Ishtar, once placed in this goddess&#x27; temple in the acropolis of Ebla. A cuneiform inscription on it bears the name of the &quot;meki&quot; (king) of Ebla Ibbit-Lim, son of Igrish-Kheb, and claims that the statue was made &quot;eight years after Ishtar&#x27;s apparition in Ebla&quot;. It is believed that this text passage refers to the election of Ishtar as the poliadic goddess of Ebla, an action most likely brought by Ibbit-Lim himself, eight years before making the statue.&lt;br&gt;
Ibbit-Lim&#x27;s torso was the first evidence permitting the identification of Tell Mardikh with the ancient city of Ebla, whose location had been lost.

As one of the earliest rulers – if not the first one – of the Third kingdom of Ebla, Ibbit-Lim may have been the king who ordered the construction of city walls. The names of Ibbit-Lim and his father Igrish-Kheb – who is not known to have been a king – are Amorite, suggesting that the inhabitants of Third kingdom of Ebla were predominantly Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.

<text>The Metropolitan Rapid Transit or MRT is a mass rapid transit system serving the Bangkok Metropolitan Region in Thailand. The MRT system comprises two fully operational rapid transit lines (Blue and Purple) and two fully operational monorail lines (Yellow and Pink), with another rapid transit line (Orange) under construction. The MRT Blue Line, officially the &quot;Chaloem Ratchamongkhon Line&quot;, between Hua Lamphong and Bang Sue was the first to open in July 2004 as Bangkok&#x27;s second metro system. The MRT Blue line is officially known in Thai as &quot;rotfaifa mahanakhon&quot; (รถไฟฟ้ามหานคร) or &quot;metropolitan electric train&quot;, but it is more commonly called &quot;rotfai taidin&quot; (รถไฟใต้ดิน), literally, &quot;underground train&quot; as it was distinguished from the BTS Skytrain by being completely underground when its first section between Hua Lamphong to Bang Sue opened.

The second MRT line MRT Purple Line, officially the &quot;Chalong Ratchadham Line&quot;, opened on 6 August 2016 and connected Tao Poon with Khlong Bang Phai in Nonthaburi in the northwest of Greater Bangkok. It was the first mass transit line to extend outside Bangkok.

Both the Blue Line and Purple Line are operated by the Bangkok Expressway and Metro Public Company Limited (BEM) under a concession granted by the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA), which is the owner of the MRT lines. Along with the BTS Skytrain and the Airport Rail Link, the MRT is part of Bangkok&#x27;s rail transportation infrastructure. The BEM-operated MRT lines have 526,000 passengers each day as of August 2024 (Blue Line 453,000 and Purple Line 73,000) with 54 operational stations and a combined route length of . Construction began in mid-2011 to extend the MRT Blue Line, after completion in April 2020, the Blue Line has become a quasi loop line (providing interchange with itself at Tha Phra) around the centre of Bangkok.

The MRT Yellow Line monorail, officially the &quot;Nakkhara Phiphat Line&quot;, opened for trial operation in June 2023 and was fully opened on 3 July 2023. The MRT Pink Line monorail opened for public trial operation in November 2023, and was fully opened on 1 February 2024. The Yellow and Pink Lines are operated by subsidiaries of BTSC, who also operate the BTS Skytrain rather than BEM.

Other MRT lines are planned for the future MRT system with the MRT Orange Line and the southern extension of the MRT Purple Line from Tao Poon to Rat Burana are under construction. The MRT Brown Line is also planned.

==History==


The MRT was constructed under a concession framework. For the first MRT line, officially known as Chaloem Ratchamongkhon or informally as the &quot;Blue Line&quot;, civil infrastructure was provided by the government sector, Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA), and handed over to their concessionaire under a 25-year concession agreement. Bangkok Expressway and Metro Public Company Limited (BEM) was the only private sector company that won a bid in MRTA&#x27;s concession contract for the blue line. As MRTA&#x27;s concessionaire, BEM provides M&amp;E equipment, including electrical trains, signalling systems, SCADA, communication, PSD, etc. for the subway project and fully operates the system. To maintain the system, BEM has subcontracted in 10 years to Siemens, which was the M&amp;E system supplier since system opening and 7 years maintenance contract to two local maintenance services for north and south line.

The construction of the first Bangkok Metro line, officially known as Chaloem Ratchamongkhon (Thai สายเฉลิมรัชมงคล) – &quot;Celebration of Royal Auspice&quot; – or informally as the &quot;Blue Line&quot;, began on 19 November 1996. The project suffered multiple delays not only because of the 1997 economic crisis, but also due to challenging civil engineering works of constructing massive underground structures deep in the water-logged soil upon which the city is built.

The Blue Line was opened for a limited public trial period of several weeks starting on 13 April 2004. On 3 July 2004 the line was officially opened at 19:19 local time by HM King Bhumibol and Queen Sirikit, who were accompanied by other members of the royal family. Within 30 minutes of its opening, sightseers filled the system to its maximum capacity, but after the initial rush ridership has settled down to around 180,000 riders daily — considerably lower than projections of over 400,000, despite fares being slashed in half from 12 to 38 baht to 10-15 baht per trip. From 2006 until 2008, fares ranged between 14 and 36 baht per trip. The fare was raised to 16-41 Baht on 1 January 2009. Daily ridership in 2014 was 253,000.

In August 2016, the Purple Line opened for service. In August 2017, the MRT Blue Line was extended to Tao Poon station allowing interchange with the Purple Lines.

==Operation==

Bangkok, a city situated on a low-lying plain, is susceptible to flooding. Consequently, the entrances to MRT stations in the city are constructed approximately one meter above ground level and are equipped with integrated floodgates to prevent water from entering the system. All stations are accessible, featuring elevators and ramps to accommodate all passengers. Additionally, stations typically have multiple exits, usually four, with some offering interchanges to other transit systems like the BTS Skytrain, Airport Rail Link, and commuter rail services. The passageways connecting these exits are spacious, with some even evolving into shopping areas. Within the stations, maps are displayed to guide passengers, showing local area details and exit locations.

As a safety measure, platform screen doors have been installed at stations. Uniformed security personnel and security cameras are stationed at all platforms to ensure passenger safety. The metro system operates 19 three-car metro trains, specifically of the Siemens Modular Metro type, consisting of two motor cars and a central trailer car.

In an effort to utilize renewable energy, the Bangkok Expressway and Metro company has entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with CK Power. This agreement aims to supply the mass transit system with 452 million kWh of electricity, primarily sourced from solar energy.

==Ticketing==

The ticketing system for the Blue and Purple Lines uses RFID contactless technology with round tokens issued for single trips and a contactless stored value card, the MRT Plus card, for frequent travellers. It is planned that a joint ticketing system will be set up so that passengers can use a single ticket on the MRT as well as on the Skytrain. Multi-storey park &amp; ride facilities are provided at Lat Phrao and Thailand Cultural Centre. Motorists who park their cars within station parking facilities are issued with additional contactless smartcards and they need to have them electronically stamped at their destination station.

Smart cards are available in two types:
* A rechargeable card for distance-based fares:
** for adults, at the same rate as single fares
** for students, not over 23 years old, at 10% discount
** for children/elderly, not over 14 old and height between , or not less than 60 old, each with 50% discount.

Children under 15 or whose height does not exceed 90 cm may ride for free. Reduced fares for older children and half price fares for the elderly also apply when buying a token at the booth.

From January 2022, MRT started accepting a new payment fare type for Blue Line and Purple Line via EMV Contactless (Europay Mastercard and Visa).

The Yellow and Pink lines accept cash, EMV Contactless, and the Rabbit Card.

==Current lines==

The first line, the Blue Line, opened on 3 July 2004. It runs eastward from Tao Poon Station in Bang Sue District along Kamphaeng Phet, Phahon Yothin and Lat Phrao Roads, then turns south following Ratchadaphisek Road, then west following Rama IV Road to Hua Lamphong Station in Pathum Wan District. The second line, the Purple Line opened on 6 August 2016. The 1.2 km missing link of the Blue Line between Bang Sue and Tao Poon, connecting the two lines opened on 11 August 2017. The first section of the Blue Line extension from Hua Lamphong via Tha Phra to Lak Song opened for full operation on 29 September 2019. The Pink and Yellow Lines opened in 2023.

===MRT Blue Line===
The MRT Blue Line presently runs from Tha Phra to Lak Song and has a carrying capacity of 40,000 people in each direction per hour. Similar to the Skytrain, the Metro uses trains supplied by Siemens that travel up to . Passengers can connect to the Skytrain at Si Lom, Sukhumvit and Chatuchak Park stations. The Blue Line has a large depot located on the large MRTA Headquarters in Huai Khwang district and accessed via a spur line located between Phra Ram 9 and Thailand Cultural Centre stations.

The 48-kilometer-long MRT Blue line will serve as a circle line for Bangkok&#x27;s metro rail system, providing connections to all other major lines, including the SRT Red Lines and the Airport Rail Link. However the complete track does not form a circle, but rather a figure 6. So to ride the complete circle one has either to start at Tha Phra or change trains there.

===MRT Purple Line===
The MRT Purple line is divided into two sections, the first 23 kilometer stage from Khlong Bang Phai to Tao Poon, which opened on 6 August 2016, and a planned 19.8 kilometer southern extension from Tao Poon – Phra Pradaeng.

The Purple line currently serves travel demand between the northwestern suburbs of Bangkok in Nonthaburi Province to the mid north areas of Bangkok where it links with the Blue line. Eventually, the line will link with the southern area of Thonburi in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province with a southern extension. This extension will serve the new Thai parliament construction site at Kiak Kai intersection and will run along Samsen Road, then passing through the historic old quarter of Bangkok Rattanakosin Island and many historical places in Dusit and Phra Nakhon District like the national library, Thewet market, Bang Lamphu, the Democracy Monument, the Golden Mount, Phahurat near Chinatown. It then runs near the Memorial Bridge over the river to Wongwian Yai roundabout before continuing south to Chom Thong and ends in Rat Burana District.

===MRT Yellow Line===
The 30.4 km long Yellow line has 23 stations. It was originally proposed to be an underground and elevated rapid transit line, but that plan has changed to be built as an elevated monorail line.

In December 2011, the MRTA was instructed by the MOT to divide the Yellow Line into two Phases for tender and construction purposes and to control land appropriation costs. In June 2012, the MRTA contracted consultants to undertake detailed designs of the Yellow Line. In February 2013, OTP stated that the tender for the Yellow line should be ready by late 2013 for tender in early 2014. However, similar to the Pink Line, delays in finalising the technical requirements of the tender in relation to the selection of monorail rolling stock, which determines the type of track to be constructed resulted in a significant delay. The subsequent political turmoil of 2014 caused further delay. Thereafter, the coup of May 2014 resulted in a new military administration and the tender being deferred for 2014.

The MRTA tender was subsequently not released until mid-2016. In early December 2016, BSR Joint Venture (comprising BTS Group Holdings, which owns 75%, Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction – STEC, and Ratchaburi Electricity Generation Holding – RATCH), won the bid for the project. The BSR also won the bid the Pink Line project. On 16 June 2017, a contract was signed for the Lat Phrao-Samrong section with the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand by a consortium including BTS Group Holdings, Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction, and Ratchaburi Electricity Generation Holding. Construction of the MRT Yellow Line began in March 2018, and free trial operations began from Hua Mak station to Samrong BTS Station in June 2023. Full operations began on July 3, 2023.

===MRT Pink Line===
The 35.5 km long MRT Pink line has 30 stations and is a monorail line. It runs in the northern part of the city from east Bangkok in Minburi District &quot;(also transfers to MRT Orange Line)&quot; along Ram Inthra Road to west Bangkok (Pak Kret district, Nonthaburi Province) Chaeng Watthana Road and Tiwanon Road ending at Nonthaburi Civic Center with interchange to the MRT Purple Line.

The line also transfers with the SRT Dark Red Line, the BTS Sukhumvit Line extension to Lam Lukka, and the BMA Proposed MRT Grey Line in the future.

The Pink line was due to be tendered in the 3rd quarter of 2013 with construction due to commence in early 2014. However, delays in preparation of the tender in relation to the selection of monorail rolling stock and subsequent political protests resulting in a snap national election in early February 2014, further delayed the Pink Line tender. A subsequent coup in May 2014 resulted in a new military administration and the tender being deferred for 2014. The MRTA tender was subsequently not released until mid-2016.

In early December 2016, BSR Joint Venture (comprising BTS Group Holdings, which owns 75%, Sino-Thai Engineering and Construction – STEC, and Ratchaburi Electricity Generation Holding – RATCH), won the bid. The BSR also won the bid for the Yellow Line project. On 16 June 2017, the Pink Line project contracts were signed with the BSR consortium by the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand with a scheduled operational date of 2022. Construction of the MRT Pink Line began in late 2017. The line opened for trial operation in November 2023 and is due to be fully operational by December 2023.

The BSR has proposed a 2.8 km spur monorail route to link to Impact, Muang Thong Thani from Si Rat station, which is under construction government.

==Future plans==


===MRT Purple Line South section===

The planned southern extension from Tao Pun to Rat Burana will run south through Bangkok&#x27;s old quarter from Tao Pun Junction on a viaduct. It then will go into an underground structure along Sam Sen Road, passing the new Thai parliament site, and transfers to the proposed Red inner-city shortcut commuter at Sanghi intersection. It passes the national library in Dusit District before it reaches Phra Nakhon District at Thewet Market.

The line turns east at Bang Lamphu and goes along the city moat to the south, with transfers possible to the MRT Orange Line at Ratchadamnoen Road near the Democracy Monument. It passes Golden Mount before possible transfers to the extension of the Blue Line at Wang Burapha near Yaowarat Road in Chinatown and the Phahurat textile market.

The line crosses the Chao Phraya River near the Memorial Bridge towards the Wongwian Yai roundabout in Thonburi on the west bank, with possible transfers to the Dark Red Line commuter and to Wongwian Yai. It continues south to Chom Thong, then on an elevated structure for and ends in Rat Burana District, a short distance to the nearby Phra Pradaeng suburban town in Samut Prakan Province. The total length will be about 23.6 km, including ten underground and seven elevated stations.

The Thai Cabinet was expected to approve the Purple Line Southern extension in mid 2017 with a tender due by the 2nd half of 2017. On 25 July 2017, the Cabinet approved the 101 billion baht budget and tender for the extension but the tender was delayed until 2018 due to land acquisition issues. There was a further delay to an early 2019 date as the tender was changed to a PPP tender. However, a subsequent delay in finalising the PPP process resulted in a new tender date of April 2020 but this has been further delayed with an expected tender by the end of 2020.

Construction contracts were finally signed in March 2022 for a planned 2027 opening date.

===MRT Orange Line===

The Orange Line will start from Yaek Rom Klao station in Min Buri district as an elevated structure on Ramkhamhaeng Road (former Suka Phiban III Road), interchanging with the Pink Line at Min Buri station from eastern suburb in and goes underground near Lam Sali intersection in Bang Kapi District, also transfers to MRT Yellow Line. It continues southwest along Ramkhamhaeng Road, passing Hua Mak Stadium and Ramkhamhaeng University. Then it turns to the west and crosses Pradit Manutham Road to the current MRT depot. Then it goes to Thailand Cultural Centre Station, the alignment crosses over and transfers to the current MRT Blue Line. It continues via Din Daeng housing estates and Bangkok City Hall 2 to Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, Sam Liam Din Daeng Junction. Then turn left into Ratchaprarop Road towards Pratunam and turn right into Phetchaburi Road then interchange with BTS Sukhumvit Line at Ratchathewi Station. It continues along Larn Luang Road and Ratchadamnoen Road. Then it crosses the Chao Phraya River near Phra Pinklao Bridge, passes Siriraj Hospital and goes along Bangkok Noi Rail line and terminates at Bang Khun Non Station, interchanges with MRT Blue Line again. The total length is 35.9 km.

This Line is divided into 2 sections
* Eastern section from Thailand Cultural Centre – Yaek Rom Klao (22.5 km). 
* Western section Bang Khun Non – Thailand Cultural Centre (13.4 km)

The phase 1 Eastern section began construction in June 2017 with a planned 2024 opening. The Phase 2 Western section extension from Thailand Cultural Centre to Bang Khun Non was released for tender on 3 July 2020 as a Public-Private Partnership project.

When fully completed, the line will be 35.9-km long, mostly underground, with 29 stations (7 elevated stations for 8.9 km and other 22 underground stations for 27 km).

===MRT Brown Line===
The 22.1 km long Brown line is under study by the OTP. It is proposed to run from Khae Rai, Nonthaburi to Bueng Kum with 20 stations and be a monorail line.

The line was originally proposed as the Gold Line by the Pheu Thai party for the Bangkok Governors election held in March 2013. This was in response to objections by Kasetsart University to long proposed Expressway extensions in the area. The line would essentially have replaced the need to build an elevated Expressway. However, the Pheu Thai candidate did not win the Bangkok Governor election and the Gold Line was dropped with the Deputy Minister of Transport stating that land appropriation costs were too high. Subsequently, OTP has reworked the Gold Line proposal into a new Brown Line following much the same route. As of June 2013, the route was under preliminary study by OTP. Public hearings on the Brown line were held in 2017. The MOT announced that a 14-month feasibility study into the line would be completed in 2018. By August 2018, OTP had completed the feasibility study and conducted public hearings. Although, there was much public support for building the MRT Brown line, public opposition to the N2 expressway remained high. OTP intends to submit the project for Cabinet approval by the end of October 2018. In early June 2019, the MRTA Board approved the investment plan for the Brown Line and integrated design with the N2 Expressway conducted by EXAT. The project is expected to be tendered in 2024.

This line should not be confused with the original 2004 13 km MRT Brown Line proposal from Bang Kapi to Min Buri. This was subsequently merged in 2009 into an extended MRT Orange Line.

=== Impact Spur Line ===

== Accidents and incidents ==
On 17 January 2005, just after 09:15, an empty train returning to the depot collided with a peak-hour train filled with passengers at the Thailand Cultural Centre MRT station. 140 people were hurt, most of whom sustained only minor injuries and the entire Metro network was shut down for two weeks.

After initial investigations, it was found that the empty train had run into problems shortly before the accident, grinding to a halt on a curve leading to the depot. The driver applied the train brake and was waiting to be towed to the maintenance centre close to the Thailand Cultural Centre station.

A rescue train was attempting to connect to the stalled train when the driver was told to release the brake even though coupling had not been successful. It was then that the empty train began to roll backwards at a speed of ten metres per second and into the other train, which was carrying passengers. Therefore, it was believed that the incident was caused by negligence due to insufficient training of operation staff. This accident caused damage to both trainsets, with heavily damaged areas limited to the two cars that collided. From the extent of the damage, investigators estimated the collision speed to be around 60 km/h. However, one train, which was rebuilt from the repair of the minor-damaged cars, was already fitted for operation at the end of 2006 and the remaining one was still under heavy repair until mid of 2007; it was released into service in October 2007. The cost resulting from the accident might be a much higher figure than BMCL quoted, and it was expected to be at least 400 million baht, which was totally insured by a local insurance company.

The Metro resumed full operation on 1 February 2005, and passenger numbers soon rose back to pre-crash levels, partly due to a temporary promotional fare scheme that allowed passengers to travel any distance on the MRT for only ten baht (~US$0.33).

== Ridership ==
The first few years of operations saw less than forecast ridership, but pax numbers grew gradually over time. After the opening of the Tao Poon interchange station between Blue Line and Purple Line in mid-August 2017, ridership immediately increased especially on the Purple Line. In September 2017, BEM stated that average daily ridership of the Blue Line had increased from 340,000 to 360,000 after the opening. The Purple line ridership significantly increased from 33,000 to nearly 50,000. In August 2018, the MRTA Deputy Governor stated that daily ridership for the Purple Line had increased to 60,000 each weekday. After the opening of the Blue Line extension to Lak Song on 29 September 2019, daily ridership increased to 400,000 for the Blue line and 70,000 for the Purple line. Ridership decreased significantly during the outbreak of coronavirus in Thailand.

<text>Lawndale is a community in Logan County, Illinois, United States which lies northeast of Springfield. The town lies on Interstate 55, part of the old Route 66, between Atlanta and Lincoln. The town lies just south of Kickapoo Creek. The town has one tavern, and a converted mobile home as its post office.

Lawndale was laid out and platted in 1854, soon after the Alton &amp; Sangamon (now Chicago &amp; Alton) railroad was extended to that point. A post office called Lawndale has been in operation since 1855.

<doc id="597400" wikidata="Q3375171" url="?curid=597400" title="Oxycodone/aspirin">
<text>Oxycodone/aspirin (trade name Percodan) is a combination drug marketed by Endo Pharmaceuticals. It is a tablet containing a mixture of 325 mg (5 grains) of aspirin and 4.8355 mg of oxycodone HCl (equivalent to 4.3346 mg of oxycodone as the free base); it is an opioid/non-opioid combination used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. The safety of the combination during pregnancy has not been established, although aspirin is generally contraindicated during pregnancy, and the drug has been placed in pregnancy category D. Inactive ingredients include D&amp;C Yellow 10, FD&amp;C Yellow 6, microcrystalline cellulose, and corn starch. Percodan was first marketed by DuPont Pharmaceuticals and prescribed in the United States in 1950. Once a widely prescribed painkiller, it has largely been replaced by alternative oxycodone compounds containing paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of aspirin, such as Percocet.

== Adverse effects ==
==Pharmacology==
The oxycodone component in the combination is technically 14-hydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodein-6-one, a white odorless, crystalline powder which is synthesized from the opium alkaloid thebaine. Thebaine by itself has no therapeutic value. Oxycodone is metabolized into oxymorphone. Unlike morphine and like codeine, oxycodone has a good oral potency. Prior to the introduction of paracetamol, Percodan was the mainstay in post-operative oral pain treatment due to the potency and long half-life of oxycodone. It originally contained a small amount of caffeine.

==Reformulation==

Percodan was reformulated in 2005; prior to 2005, it contained two oxycodone salts—4.62 mg of oxycodone hydrochloride and 0.38 mg of oxycodone terephthalate. Since the latter salt is unusual in the pharmacopeia, the manufacturer increased the amount of oxycodone hydrochloride to 4.8355 mg and discontinued the oxycodone terephthalate.

==History==
Percodan was patented in 1953 by Mozes J. Lewenstein.

==Miscellaneous==
The combination oxycodone/aspirin is also sold under the brand name Endodan. All products containing oxycodone (including Percodan, Percocet, OxyContin) have the potential to be habit-forming. Oxycodone can produce drug dependence of the morphine type and, therefore, has the potential for being addictive.

<doc id="597403" wikidata="Q5072438" url="?curid=597403" title="Channel One News">
<text>Channel One News was an American news content provider. The daily news program was accompanied by commercial advertising for marketing in schools, with supplementary educational resources. The Peabody award-winning Channel One News program was broadcast mainly to minors, advertising a way for young teens to understand happenings worldwide. Susan Winston (former executive producer of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;) and Daniel Funk were brought in to design the broadcast and produce the six weeks of test shows. On May 13, 2014, it was sold for an undisclosed price to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. On June 28, 2018, HMH announced that Channel One&#x27;s last broadcast occurred in May and that they would be &quot;winding down ongoing operations&quot;.

==History==

Channel One was founded in 1989. It began with a pilot program in four high schools before its national rollout in 1990, with original anchors and reporters Ken Rogers, Lynne Blades, and Brian Tochi. Christopher Whittle founded it along with co-founder Ed Winter, advertising and marketing executives based in Knoxville, Tennessee. Primedia purchased Channel One for approximately $250 million from Whittle in 1994, with Ed Winter remaining as chairman for several more years.

The program&#x27;s first executive producer, Cynthia Samuels, came to Channel One from 9 years on &quot;Today&quot;. While at Channel One, she created Student Producer Week (in which students produced, reported, directed, and designed an entire week of programming), Channel One&#x27;s one-hour specials (including one in Moscow and Ohio, one in Tokyo and Texas, one in Los Angeles after the Rodney King riots hosted by Arsenio Hall) and OneVote (an &quot;election night&quot; for students to vote for president and watch the returns come in live from their classrooms). After Cynthia Samuels came Douglas Greenlaw, former president of MTV, followed by David Neuman, former vice president of comedy at NBC.

From 1997 until 2000, Andy Hill was president of programming for Channel One News, where he produced award-winning news programming for an audience of eight million American teens.

In December 2007, Channel One&#x27;s parent company, Primedia, classified its Education Segment, which includes Channel One Network, as a &quot;discontinued operation&quot; and announced that it was &quot;exploring strategic alternatives for&quot; the businesses in that segment. In 2007, Primedia sold Channel One to Alloy Media.

In July 2007, NBC News announced that it would be partnering with Alloy under an arrangement in which NBC would work with Channel One News to produce original content for Channel One&#x27;s in-school broadcasts, providing Channel One with access to global news gathering resources. In 2009, CBS News entered into a partnership with Channel One.

Alloy was bought by ZelnickMedia in 2010. On May 13, 2014, Channel One was acquired by the educational publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; the company stated that the purchase would foster the &quot;continued development of high-quality digital content for students, teachers, and parents across multiple modalities, and will bring significant video and cross-media production capabilities in-house.&quot;

==Business model==
The original model for Channel One had it providing schools and school districts with televisions, headend units, and satellite receivers. Schools would record the broadcast and transmit it into classrooms. Ads were displayed during the broadcast to cover the costs of the equipment. Starting in 1989, schools began to accept two minutes of advertisement. In 2011, the network began offering a subscription fee to receive an ad-free version of its transmissions.

==OneVote==
Channel One held mock presidential elections called OneVote shortly before the general elections in 1992, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. With the exception of the 2016 election, the popular vote winner in each OneVote election accurately predicted the electoral college winner of the respective real presidential election.

1992: The initial vote in 1992 had 3,400,000 participants. Bill Clinton won the 1992 OneVote, garnering 43% of the vote. George H. W. Bush got 27%, with independent H. Ross Perot getting 24% of the vote.

2000: When OneVote returned in 2000, 877,497 students participated, choosing Texas Governor George W. Bush in a mock election with nearly 59% of the vote. Vice-president Al Gore was voted second with 36% of the vote.

2004: The 2004 OneVote gave George W. Bush 55% of the vote. John Kerry finished second with 40% of the vote, while all third-party candidates as a group (voters could only vote for them as a group) got 5%. The vote consisted of 1,400,000 students.

2008: The 2008 OneVote gave Barack Obama 51.5 percent of the vote. John McCain finished second with 48.5 percent.

2012: The 2012 OneVote gave Barack Obama 50 percent of the vote. Mitt Romney finished second with 44 percent.

2016: The 2016 OneVote gave Hillary Clinton 47 percent of the vote. Donald Trump finished second with 41 percent.

==Controversy==
Channel One was controversial largely because of the commercial content of the show. Critics claimed that it was a problem in classrooms because it forced children to watch ads and wasted class time and tax dollars. Supporters argued that the ads were necessary to help keep the program running and lease TVs, VCRs, and satellite dishes to schools, as well as commercial-free educational video through Channel One Connection. In 2006, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported that research indicated that children who watched Channel One remembered the commercials more than they remembered the news.

Another criticism, noted by Media Education Foundation&#x27;s documentary &quot;Captive Audience&quot;, was that very little time was dedicated to actual news and that the majority of the programming was corporate marketing and PR tie-ins to promote products and services, arguing that it further corrupted the school setting with consumerism.

<doc id="597408" wikidata="Q7712432" url="?curid=597408" title="The Adventure Game">
<text>The Adventure Game was a game show originally broadcast on UK television channels BBC1 and BBC2 between 24 May 1980 and 18 February 1986. The story in each show was that the two celebrity contestants and a member of the public had travelled by spaceship to the planet Arg. Their overall task varied with each series. For example, the team might be charged with finding a crystal to power their ship to return to Earth. The programme is often considered to have been a forerunner of &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;.

==Background==
The programme was devised by experienced BBC producer Patrick Dowling (who also introduced episodes of series 2). Dowling was interested in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and wanted to televise a show to capture the mood. The programme had a similar sci-fi feel influenced by Douglas Adams; Dowling asked Adams to write the show, but he was working on the television production of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The first two series were written and produced by Dowling and directed by Ian Oliver, who wrote and produced the final two after Dowling retired. Peter Hawkins provided the opening narration for series one and four.

==Characters==
Arg was inhabited by shapeshifting dragons known as Argonds. As a reference to this, most proper nouns in the programme (including &quot;Argond&quot;) were anagrams of the word &quot;dragon&quot;. Argonds commonly shifted form, primarily to human, to avoid scaring contestants a few minutes before the contestants arrived.

Notable characters within the game included:
* The &quot;Rangdo&quot; was the ruler of planet Arg and was initially referred to as &quot;Uncle&quot; by the other Argonds. In the first series, his human form was played by Ian Messiter, who appeared as an old professor in a velvet jacket, but in later series, he became one of the few Argonds not to appear as a dragon. In series 2 and 3, he became an aspidistra on a plant stand. In series 3, he could move around the room and roared and shook when he was angry (the Rangdo was controlled by Kenny Baker). Any human meeting the Rangdo had to placate him by bowing while saying &quot;Gronda! Gronda!&quot;. In the last series, the Rangdo became a teapot instead, spouting steam when displeased.
* &quot;Darong&quot; (series 1, played by BBC newsreader Moira Stuart).
* &quot;Gnoard&quot; (series 1 – 3, played by Charmian Gradwell), whose job it was to explain the initial stages of the game to the contestants.
* &quot;Dorgan&quot; (series 4, played by Sarah Lam), who took over from Gnoard in the final series.
* &quot;Gandor&quot; (series 1 – 4, played by Chris Leaver), an ancient, half-deaf butler who took the contestants through most of the puzzles and refereed the Vortex and Drogna games. In some episodes, he could only hear when he was wearing his spectacles, which he continually (and conveniently) misplaced.
* &quot;Rongad&quot; (series 3 &amp; 4, played by Bill Homewood), because he was Australian, spoke English backwards, and could only understand the contestants if they did the same. Noted for singing &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; in reverse and exclamations of &quot;Doogy Rev!&quot; when the contestants did well. He appears in every episode of series three and episode 2 of series four.
* &quot;Angord&quot; (series 4, actor unknown) was an Argond who never seemed to turn into a human. She always misbehaved when Gandor and Dorgan were checking the puzzles.
* &quot;The Mole&quot; (series 2, played by Lesley Judd), pretended to be one of the regular contestants but was working against them. The actress had been a genuine contestant in the first series.

The look of the characters in Argond form was different in the various series. In Series 1, they looked like dragons, and each was distinct. In Series 2, they didn&#x27;t look like dragons, but were furry, with no tails and mask-like faces, and primarily differed in colour. In Series 3 and 4, their heads returned to looking like dragons, with ruffs, though they had furry bodies and monkey-like tails and were almost identical to each other.

Notable contestants included Keith Chegwin, Sue Cook, astronomer Heather Couper, John Craven, Paul Darrow, Noel Edmonds, Sarah Greene, Bonnie Langford, James Burke, Elizabeth Estensen, Janet Fielding, and Richard Stilgoe.

The credits for the series listed the human characters as being played by Argonds rather than the other way around.

==Common tasks==
The contestants had to complete several tasks to achieve their overall goal (i.e., regain their crystal and return to their ship). Many tasks involved the &quot;drogna&quot;, a small transparent plastic disc containing a solid geometric figure, which was the currency of Arg. The value of a drogna was its numbered position in the visible spectrum multiplied by the number of sides of the figure (though the contestants usually failed to work this out). For example, a red circle is worth one unit, an orange circle is worth two units, a red triangle and a yellow circle are both worth three and so on.

Tasks that often appeared included:
* Interaction with a computer, in series 1 a 2D dungeon-crawl-type game on an HP 9845 Technical Desktop, then later a text chat with an Apple II that generally failed to provide any useful information until the password was revealed elsewhere and entered into the computer, then in series 3 and 4 a pseudo-3D first-person POV dungeon crawl on a BBC Micro to find the password in the maze. In series 3, the players were guiding an alien doglike creature called a &quot;Dogran&quot; (voiced in a Cockney accent) down his &quot;Dogran-hole&quot; after meeting him in person. In series 4, the radio-controlled dog puppet was eliminated, and the players guided an unseen entity speaking in a Scouse accent to find the password &quot;somewhere in the north&quot; of the maze.
* The Drogna Game usually came in the middle of the programme. The game&#x27;s rules of play, format, and result were changed frequently, always with each series, and sometimes from one episode to another. Two players played one variation from series three: one player was a contestant, and the other a creature known as the Red Salamander of Zardil. This became so popular that Acornsoft released a home version for the BBC Micro, written by Patrick Dowling.
* &quot;How many Argonds are around the pond?&quot; This game was played predominantly in Series 4 just before the Vortex game. Every player had a chance to win, and winners received a &quot;Green Cheese roll&quot; or, in later episodes, a &quot;Great Crystal of Arg&quot; to fanfare. The green cheese roll was of use when playing the Vortex. Gandor compèred the game; it started on a table with several &quot;Drogba&quot; inside a velvet bag. He shook the bag, withdrew some drognas, placed them on the table, and asked the first contestant, &quot;How many Argonds are around the pond?&quot;. The contestants would usually either count the drognas or the non-blue drognas (assuming the blue one represented the pond), add the sides or points of the geometric figures on the drognas, and fail to guess the correct number. The key was that Gandor placed his fingers on the tabletop as he said, &quot;How many Argonds are around the pond?&quot; The number of fingers he placed on the table was the right answer.
* The Vortex (series 2 - 4). This was the last task in the programme. To return to their ship, the players had to jump between a grid of points, taking turns with their opponent, the Vortex. The Vortex was represented by a video-effect-generated pulsating column in series two and a computer-generated flashing column in series 3 and 4. If the human player jumped into the Vortex (which they could not see), it would explode, and the human was said to have been &quot;evaporated,&quot; losing the game and making a long trip back to Earth which had to be walked by foot along the interplanetary highway. Patrick Dowling devised the game, saying that his inspiration was probably Nine men&#x27;s morris.

<text>Frederick Peters (April 8, 1851 – July 29, 1919) was a lawyer and Prince Edward Island politician, who served as the sixth premier of Prince Edward Island.

==Early life and career==
Peters was born in Charlottetown and educated at King&#x27;s College in Nova Scotia. Frederick&#x27;s parents were Judge James Horsfield Peters (whose grandparents James Peters and Margaret Lester were United Empire Loyalists from New York) and Mary Cunard (eldest daughter of Sir Samuel Cunard). He went on to study law in England and was called to bar there in 1876. He was called to the bars of Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia later that year and set up practice in Charlottetown.

==Political career==
A Liberal, Peters won election to the House of Assembly in 1890. He was asked to form a government in 1891 after the Conservative government lost a motion of confidence in the house. The Peters government abolished both the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly and brought in a new legislative assembly to create a unicameral form of government. Peters served as Premier until resigning in 1897 to move to British Columbia though he retained his seat in the legislature until 1899 despite no longer residing in the province. In 1892, Premier Peters and his Cabinet (Executive Council) explained key articles of the &quot;Amalgamation Bill,&quot; including the provision that thirty MLAs would comprise the new &quot;Legislative Assembly,&quot; for Canadian Minister of Justice Sir John Sparrow David Thompson. Fifteen MLAs would be &quot;elected by voters eligible to vote for the present legislative council, and the other half by voters eligible to vote for our present house of assembly...The bill leaves the districts as before with the exception that it was necessary to enlarge the bounds of Georgetown district in King&#x27;s county. This district only containing about 200 voters, and it not being deemed fair to allow so small a constituency to exist, in face of the fact that several other constituencies contained as many as 2000 voters. In order to do this change had to be made in three of the constituencies in King&#x27;s county.&quot; The &quot;Amalgamation Bill&quot; abolished the Legislative Council, but added two representatives to the total number of MLAs voted into the legislature by &quot;voters who possess a certain real property qualification.&quot; The bill further reduced thirty delegates elected to the legislature by a limited qualification that &quot;almost amounts to manhood suffrage&quot; to fifteen MLAs. In a demarcation of provincial from Dominion jurisdiction, Prince Edward Island &quot;persons in the permanent employ of the various departments of the Dominion government service&quot; could not vote for the &quot;Legislative Assembly.&quot; The preamble and section 179 stipulated that voting qualifications &quot;should not be altered in one particular, namely, the qualification of the voters for the property candidates or council men, or the proportionate number of councillors in the new house, without a two-third vote of the new house.&quot; The Liberal petitioners did not explicitly engage with Conservative concerns that voters without &quot;real property qualification&quot; could only vote for fifteen out of the thirty MLAs, while voters with &quot;real property&quot; could vote for all thirty delegates. Sir Thompson, a Roman Catholic and nominee for Conservative Prime Minister of Canada, grew leery of a Protestant backlash against the Dominion Conservative Party. He counseled the Governor General to &quot;take no action&quot; until passage of the provincial bill. He then counseled &quot;approval&quot; of the resulting statute.

==Legal career in British Columbia==
Peters was Chief Counsel for the Great Britain in the Behring Sea Claims Commission, 1896–1897. His associate counsel was Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, who as Minister of Fisheries was involved in the earlier Bering Sea Arbitration between Great Britain and the United States. The commission held hearings in Victoria, British Columbia from November 23, 1896 to February 2, 1897. This close working partnership, as well as the developing economic conditions on the west coast – particularly with the stampede to the Klondike Gold Rush – encouraged both men to resign their political and legal careers in the Maritimes and begin a joint legal practice in Victoria. Peters and Tupper arrived in Victoria on November 11, 1897. By July 1898 they had opened two partnerships, Tupper, Peters and Potts in Victoria and Tupper, Peters and Gilmour in Vancouver.

In 1911 Frederick Peters left his legal practice and moved north to become City Solicitor for the City of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. He arrived in the north coast town on May 17, 1911, when it was barely one year old (having been incorporated in March 1910). Peters&#x27; legal and political experience were important as he helped the community make the transition from a frontier company town to port city. He remained as City Solicitor until his death in 1919.

==Personal life==
Peters married Roberta Hamilton Susan Gray (daughter of P.E.I. Father of Confederation John Hamilton Gray) in Charlottetown in 1886. They had six children: Mary Helen Peters (1887–1976), Frederick Thornton Peters (1889–1942), John Francklyn Peters (1892–1915), Gerald Hamilton Peters (1894–1916), Noel Quintan Peters (1894–1964) and Violet Avis Peters (1899–1905).

Daughter Violet died in &quot;a fireplace accident&quot; at their home in Oak Bay, British Columbia in 1905. She was buried in Ross Bay Cemetery. When Frederick Peters died in 1919, his remains were brought to Victoria and he was buried beside his daughter. Following his death, Roberta Peters lived with her daughter Mary Dewdney in New Denver, British Columbia. She died in nearby Nelson in 1946.

Two sons, John Francklyn Peters and Gerald Hamilton Peters, died in action in World War I. Another son, Frederick Thornton Peters, died in November 1942 five days after action in the Allied invasion of Oran for which he received the Victoria Cross and the U.S. Distinguished Service Cross.

Frederick&#x27;s brother, Arthur Peters, was also active in politics, serving as premier of Prince Edward Island from 1901 to 1908. His cousin Lt. Col. James Peters also had a distinguished military career and was District Officer Commanding in BC, based at Esquimalt, British Columbia.

<doc id="597411" wikidata="Q3345022" url="?curid=597411" title="Daniel Vettori">
<text>Daniel Luca Vettori (born 27 January 1979) is a New Zealand cricket coach and former cricketer who played for the New Zealand national cricket team. He was the 200th player to win their Test cricket cap for New Zealand and an inductee in the New Zealand Cricket Hall of Fame. He is currently an assistant coach of the Australia men&#x27;s national cricket team.

Vettori was the youngest male player to have represented New Zealand in Test cricket, making his debut in February 1997 at the age of 18. He captained New Zealand between 2007 and 2011 and is New Zealand&#x27;s most-capped Test cricketer and One Day International cricketer, with 112 Test caps and 291 ODI caps. A bowling all-rounder, Vettori was the eighth player in Test cricket history to take 300 wickets and score 3,000 runs.

A slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, Vettori was known for his accuracy, flight and guile rather than prodigious turn. He was also a part of the New Zealand squad to finish as runners-up at the 2015 Cricket World Cup; after which he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. He has since coached in a variety of roles.

==Career==
Vettori was born in Auckland and brought up in Hamilton, attending Marian School and later St. Paul&#x27;s Collegiate School. He was initially a medium-pace bowler, but slowly transitioned to bowl off spin deliveries. He made his senior debut for Northern Districts in 1996/97 and his international debut during England&#x27;s 1997 tour of New Zealand at the age of 18, at the time the youngest man to play Test cricket for New Zealand. He took his first international five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka in March of the same year.

He was among a very small minority of international sports stars to wear prescription spectacles while playing sport, and only one of very few cricketers in the modern era to play Test cricket with spectacles.

===Captaincy===
Prior to becoming captain on a permanent basis in 2007, Vettori had captained New Zealand in ODI cricket on occasion. He captained New Zealand at the inaugural Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa and subsequently was appointed the team&#x27;s captain in all formats.

Vettori&#x27;s captaincy began with a losing Test series in England and attracted some criticism during the ODI series which followed. He had shouted from the balcony at The Oval following a controversial run out and later refused to shake hands with the England team after the match. This approach contrasted with Fleming&#x27;s more languid, laid back style.

Vettori stood down from the captaincy and retired from One day International and Twenty20 International cricket after the 2011 World Cup. He was recalled into the ODI team for the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2015 Cricket World Cup, by which time he had retired from Test cricket, his final Test match was as an emergency injury replacement against Pakistan in November 2014.

===Bowling records===
Vettori took his 300th Test wicket on New Zealand&#x27;s tour of Sri Lanka in 2009, becoming only the second New Zealander to do so, joining Richard Hadlee. As of August 2022 his 362 Test wickets lies second only to Hadlee and he is New Zealand&#x27;s leading One Day International wicket-taker with 297 dismissals for the national side.

Vettori was the first left-arm spin bowler to take more than 300 wickets in both Test matches and One Day Internationals.
He was the youngest man to take 100 Test wickets, doing so by the age of 21. In 2005, 2008 and 2010 he was named in the World ODI XI by the International Cricket Council and was named in the team of the tournament for the 2015 Cricket World Cup.

Vettori took 20 five-wicket hauls in Test matches, including taking ten wickets in a match three times. His best innings figures were achieved in Auckland in 1999–2000 against Australia where he took 7/87; he finished with career best-match figures of 12/149, the second best by a New Zealander at the time. As of August 2022 these match figures remain the third-best ever by a New Zealander, with only Ajaz Patel and Richard Hadlee having taken better figures in a match. He also took 12 wickets against Bangladesh 2004 and 10 against Sri Lanka in 2006. He took two five-wicket hauls in One Day International matches.

===Batting===

Vettori developed into a useful lower-order batsman, scoring more than 4,500 Test runs, including six centuries. Although it took him 47 Tests to score his first 1,000 runs at an average of 17.24, the second thousand took just 22 Tests at an average of 42.52 per innings. His highest Test score of 140 came against Sri Lanka at Singhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground, Colombo in August 2009.

===Coaching career===
Vettori was head coach of Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League from 2014 to 2018. In July 2019, he was appointed as the head coach of the Dublin Chiefs in the first season of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament; the tournament was later cancelled. The same month, he became the spin bowling coach for the Bangladesh national side.

In August 2021, Vettori was appointed as the head coach of the Caribbean Premier League franchise Barbados Royals.

In May 2022, Vettori was appointed an assistant coach of the Australia men&#x27;s national team. He remained in the role in 2023.

In August 2023, Vettori was appointed as the head coach of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League.

==Personal life==
Vettori is of Italian origin. He married Mary O&#x27;Carroll in 2007; the couple have three children. He moved from Hamilton to Auckland after his marriage but continued to play for Northern Districts throughout his career. Vettori was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2011 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for services to cricket. Vettori is the first cousin of David Hill, a rugby union player who played in one Test for the All Blacks.

A biography of Vettori entitled &quot;Turning Point&quot; was published in August 2008.

<doc id="597416" wikidata="Q763742" url="?curid=597416" title="Bar Lev Line">
<text>The Bar-Lev Line ( ; ) was a chain of fortifications built by Israel along the eastern bank of the Suez Canal shortly after the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, during which Egypt lost the entire Sinai Peninsula. It was considered impenetrable by the Israeli military until it was overrun in less than two hours during Egypt&#x27;s Operation Badr, which sparked the 1973 Arab–Israeli War.

==History==

=== Six-Day War and War of Attrition ===
The Bar-Lev Line evolved from a group of rudimentary fortifications placed along the canal line. In response to Egyptian artillery bombardments during the War of Attrition, Israel developed the fortifications into an elaborate defense system spanning along Suez Canal, with the exception of the Great Bitter Lake (where a canal crossing was unlikely due to the width of the lake). The Bar-Lev Line was designed to defend against any major Egyptian assault across the canal, and was expected to function as a &quot;graveyard for Egyptian troops&quot;.

=== Cost, construction, and materials ===
The line, costing around $300 million in 1973, was named after Israeli Chief of Staff Haim Bar-Lev. The line was built at the Suez Canal, a unique water barrier that Moshe Dayan described as &quot;one of the best anti-tank ditches in the world.&quot; The line incorporated a massive, continuous sand wall lining the entire canal, and was supported by a concrete wall. The sand wall, which varied in height from , was inclined at an angle of 45–65 degrees. The sand wall and its concrete support prevented any armored or amphibious units from landing on the east bank of the Suez Canal without prior engineering preparations. Israeli planners estimated it would take at least 24 hours, probably a full 48 hours for the Egyptians to breach the sand wall and establish a bridge across the canal.

Immediately behind this sand wall was the front line of Israeli fortifications. After the War of Attrition, there were 22 forts, which incorporated 35 strongpoints. The forts were designed to be manned by a platoon. The strongpoints, which were built several stories into the sand, were on average situated less than from each other, but at likely crossing points they were less than apart. The strongpoints incorporated trenches, minefields, barbed wire and a sand embankment. Major strongpoints had up to 26 bunkers with medium and heavy machineguns, 24 troop shelters, six mortar positions, four bunkers housing anti-aircraft weapons, and three firing positions for tanks. The strongpoints were surrounded by nearly fifteen circles of barbed wire and minefields to a depth of . A strongpoint&#x27;s perimeter averaged . The bunkers and shelters provided protection against anything less than a 500 kg bomb, and offered luxuries to the defenders such as air conditioning. Between behind the canal, there were prepared firing positions designed to be occupied by tanks assigned to the support of the strongpoints. Some of the names of the strongpoints were Tasa, Maftzach, Milano, Mezach, Chizayon, Mifreket, Orcal, Budapest (the largest), Nisan, Lituf, Chashiva. In addition, there were eleven strongholds located behind the canal, which were built along sandy hills. Each stronghold was designed to hold a company of troops.

To take advantage of the water obstacle, the Israelis installed an underwater pipe system to pump flammable crude oil into the Suez Canal, thereby creating a sheet of flame. Some Israeli sources claim the system was unreliable and only a few of the taps were operational. Nevertheless, the Egyptians took this threat seriously and, on the eve of the war, during the late evening of 5 October, teams of Egyptian frogmen blocked the underwater openings with concrete.

==Defensive plans==

To support the Bar-Lev Line, Israel built a well-planned and elaborate system of roads. Three main roads ran north–south. The first was the Lexicon Road (Infantry Road), running along the canal, which allowed the Israelis to move between the fortifications and conduct patrols. The second was the Artillery Road, around from the canal. Its name came from the twenty artillery and air defense positions located on it; it also linked armored concentration areas and logistical bases. The Lateral Road (Supply Road), from the canal, was meant to allow the concentration of Israeli operational reserves which, in case of an Egyptian offensive, would counterattack the main Egyptian assault. A number of other roads running east to west, Quantara Road, Hemingway Road, and Jerusalem Road were designed to facilitate the movement of Israeli troops towards the canal.

The defense of the Sinai depended upon two plans, Dovecote (שׁוֹבָךְ יוֹנִים/Shovakh Yonim) and Rock (סֶלַע/Sela). In both plans, the Israeli General Staff expected the Bar-Lev Line to serve as a &quot;stop line&quot; or &quot;kav atzira&quot;—a defensive line that had to be held at all cost. As noted by an Israeli colonel shortly after the War of Attrition, &quot;The line was created to provide military answers to two basic needs: first, to prevent the possibility of a major Egyptian assault on Sinai with the consequent creation of a bridgehead which could lead to all-out war; and, second, to reduce as much as possible the casualties among the defending troops.&quot;

Israeli planning was based on a 48-hour advance warning by intelligence services of an impending Egyptian attack. During these 48 hours, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) would assault enemy air defense systems, while Israeli forces deployed as planned. The Israelis expected an Egyptian attack would be defeated by armored brigades supported by the superior IAF.

Dovecote tasked a regular armored division to the defense of the Sinai. The division was supported by an additional tank battalion, twelve infantry companies and seventeen artillery batteries. This gave a total of over 300 tanks, 70 artillery guns and 18,000 troops. These forces, which represented the Sinai garrison, were tasked with the mission of defeating an Egyptian crossing at or near the canal line. It called for around 800 soldiers to man the forward fortifications on the canal line. Meanwhile, along Artillery Road, a brigade of 110 tanks was stationed with the objective of advancing and occupying the firing positions and tanks ramparts along the canal in case of an Egyptian attack. There were two additional armored brigades, one to reinforce the forward brigade, and the other to counterattack the main Egyptian attack.

Should the regular armored division prove incapable of repulsing an Egyptian attack, the Israeli army would activate Rock, mobilizing two reserve armored divisions with support elements; implementation of Rock signified a major war.

=== Israeli skepticism ===
Generals Ariel Sharon and Israel Tal objected to the line and argued that it would not succeed in fending off Egyptian attackers. Sharon said that it would pin down large military formations, which would be sitting ducks for deadly artillery attacks, but the line was completed in spring 1970.
==Yom Kippur War==
=== Egyptian breach ===
During the Yom Kippur War, the Egyptian army, led by Chief of staff Saad El Shazly, overran the Bar-Lev Line in less than two hours due to the element of surprise and overwhelming firepower. To deal with the massive earthen ramparts, the Egyptians used water cannons fashioned from hoses attached to dredging pumps in the canal. Other methods involving explosives, artillery, and bulldozers were too costly in time and required nearly ideal working conditions. In 1971, a young Egyptian officer, Baki Zaki Yousef, suggested a small, light, petrol-fueled pump as the answer to the crossing dilemma. The Egyptian military purchased 300 British-made pumps, five of which could blast 1,500 cubic meters of sand in three hours. In 1972, it acquired 150 more powerful German pumps driven by small gas turbines. A combination of two German or three British pumps would cut the breaching time down to two hours. These cannons pumped out powerful jets of water, creating 81 breaches in the line and removing three million cubic metres of packed dirt on the first day of the war.

The Egyptians assaulted the Bar-Lev Line with two field armies and forces from Port Said and the Red Sea Military District. The Second Field Army covered the area from north of Qantara to south of Deversoir, while the Third Field Army was responsible for the area from Bitter Lakes to south of Port Tawfiq.
The Egyptians began their simultaneous air and artillery attacks with 250 Egyptian Air Force planes attacking their assigned targets accurately in Sinai. Meanwhile, 2,000 artillery pieces opened massive fire against all the strong points along the Bar-Lev Line, a barrage that lasted 53 minutes and dropped 10,500 shells in the first minute alone, or 175 shells per second.
Within the first hour of the war, the Egyptian engineering corps tackled the sand barrier. Seventy engineer groups, each one responsible for opening a single passage, worked from wooden boats. With hoses attached to water pumps, they began attacking the sand obstacle. Many breaches occurred within two to three hours of the start of operations—according to schedule; however, engineers at several places experienced unexpected problems. The sand from the breached openings in the barrier was reduced to mud, which was one meter deep in some areas. This problem required that the engineers emplace floors of wood, rails, stone, sandbags, steel plates, or metal nets for the passage of heavy vehicles. The Third Army, in particular, had difficulty in its sector. There, the clay proved resistant to high-water pressure and, consequently, the engineers experienced delays in their breaching. Engineers in the Second Army completed the erection of their bridges and ferries within nine hours, whereas the Third Army needed more than sixteen hours. 

=== Israeli defense ===
Of the 441 Israeli soldiers in 16 forts on the Bar-Lev Line at the start of the war, 126 were killed and 161 captured. Only Budapest, to the north of the line near the Mediterranean city of Port Said, held out for the duration of the war, while all the others were overrun.

==Criticism==

In his book &quot;The Yom Kippur War: The Epic Encounter That Transformed the Middle East&quot;, historian Abraham Rabinovich posits that the Bar-Lev line was a blunder—too lightly manned to be an effective defensive line and too heavily manned to be an expendable tripwire. Moreover, it can be argued that the concept of the line was counter-intuitive to the strengths of Israeli battle tactics, which, at their core, relied on agile mobile forces moving rapidly through the battlefield rather than utilizing a heavy reliance on fixed defenses.

<doc id="597423" wikidata="Q284531" url="?curid=597423" title="Al-Hakam II">
<text>Al-Hakam II, also known as Abū al-ʿĀṣ al-Mustanṣir bi-Llāh al-Hakam b. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān (; 13 January 915 – 1 October 976), was the Caliph of Córdoba. He was the second Umayyad Caliph of Córdoba in Al-Andalus, and son of Abd-al-Rahman III and Murjan. He ruled from 961 to 976.

==Rule==

Al-Hakam II succeeded to the Caliphate after the death of his father Abd-ar-Rahman III in 961. He secured peace with the Catholic kingdoms of northern Iberia, and made use of the stability to develop agriculture through the construction of irrigation works. Economic development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets.

Whilst the internal administration was left increasingly to vizir Al-Mushafi, general Ghālib ibn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān was gradually gaining influence as leader of the army in North Africa. He was chiefly preoccupied with repulsing the last Norman attacks (c. 970), and with the struggle against the Zirids and the Fatimids in northern Morocco. The Fatimids were defeated in Morocco in 974, while Al-Hakam II was able to maintain the supremacy of the caliphate over the Catholic states of Navarre, Castile and León.

==Patronage==

=== Literature and science ===

Hakam himself was very well versed in numerous sciences. He had books purchased from Damascus, Baghdad, Constantinople, Cairo, Mecca, Medina, Kufa, and Basra. His status as a patron of knowledge brought him fame across the Muslim world to the point that even books written in Persia, which was under Arab Abbasid control, were dedicated to him. During his reign, a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated from Latin and Greek into Arabic. He formed a joint committee of Muwallad Muslims and Mozarab Catholics for this task.

His personal library was of enormous proportions. Some accounts speak of him having more than 600,000 books. The catalogue of library books itself was claimed to be 44 volumes long. Of special importance to Al-Hakam was history, and he himself wrote a history of al-Andalus. Following his death, &quot;Hajib&quot; Almanzor had all &quot;ancient science&quot; books destroyed.

The mathematician Lubna of Córdoba was employed as Al-Hakam&#x27;s private secretary. She was said to be &quot;thoroughly versed in the exact sciences; her talents were equal to the solution of the most complex geometrical and algebraic problems&quot;.

The famous physician, scientist, and surgeon Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) was also active in Al-Hakam&#x27;s court during his reign, while the leading figures of the Translation movement during the reign of Hakam were Mutazilites and Ibn Masarra.

=== Construction ===

Starting in 961, al-Hakam II initiated a major expansion of the Great Mosque of Córdoba. The mosque&#x27;s prayer hall was extended 45 meters further south. This expansion added several of the building&#x27;s most architecturally significant features that have survived to the present day, including a richly-decorated mihrab, intersecting multifoil arches, and four ornate ribbed domes.

The palace-city of Madinat al-Zahra, first built by his father Abd ar-Rahman III after 936, continued to be built up and renovated under al-Hakam II.

==Personal life==
Al-Hakam married Subh of Cordoba, a Basque concubine. She held sway and strong influence over the court. It is said that al-Hakam nicknamed her with the masculine name Ja&#x27;far. They had two sons, the first is Abd al-Rahman (962–970), who died young, and the second is Hisham II (966–1013).

===Possible homosexuality===
According to É. Lévi-Provençal, the phrase &quot;Ḥubb al-walad&quot;, as found in al-Maqqari&#x27;s &quot;Nafḥ al-ṭayyib&quot;, is a reference to al-Hakam&#x27;s homosexuality or &quot;preference for boys&quot;. However, several historians render it as &quot;paternal love&quot;, referring instead to him choosing his young son as a successor. The fact that he did not produce a suitable heir before the age of 46 has been ascribed either to him being more attracted to men,—although this is only reported euphemistically in the sources,—or because he was too absorbed with his books to care for sensual pleasures. Subh may have dressed as a ghulam or a young man to make herself more attractive to al-Hakam (adopting a short haircut and wearing trousers), although it is also possible she did this in order to gain better access to the male-dominated royal court.

==Death and succession==
Al-Hakam II suffered a stroke near the end of his life that curtailed his activities and may explain why he was unable to properly prepare his son for leadership. Modern scholars have speculated that, based on the historical descriptions of his death, it was another cerebrovascular stroke, possibly brought on by the cold weather, that claimed his life in October 976. He was succeeded by his son, Hisham II al-Mu&#x27;ayad, who was 11 years old at the time and during his minority under regency by General Ghalib al-Nasiri, al-Mushafi, chief administrator of the late caliph, and Subh, his mother, assisted by her secretary Almanzor.

<doc id="597441" wikidata="Q284558" url="?curid=597441" title="Al-Hakam I">
<text>Abu al-As al-Hakam ibn Hisham ibn Abd al-Rahman () was Umayyad Emir of Cordoba from 796 until 822 in Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia).

==Biography==
Al-Hakam was the second son of his father, his older brother having died at an early age. When he came to power, he was challenged by his uncles Sulayman and Abdallah, sons of his grandfather Abd ar-Rahman I. Abdallah took his two sons Ubayd Allah and Abd al-Malik to the court of Charlemagne in Aix-la-Chapelle to negotiate for aid. In the meantime Sulayman attacked Cordoba, but was defeated and driven back to Mérida where he was captured and executed. Abdallah was pardoned, but was forced to stay in Valencia.

Al-Hakam spent much of his reign suppressing rebellions in Toledo, Saragossa and Mérida. The uprisings twice reached Cordoba. An attempt was made to dethrone Al-Hakam and replace him with his cousin, Mohammed ibn al-Kasim, but the plot was discovered. On 16 November 806, 72 nobles and their attendants (accounts talk of 5,000) were massacred at a banquet, crucified and displayed along the banks of the river Guadalquivir. Such displays of cruelty were not unusual during this period, with the heads of rebel leaders or Christian foes killed in expeditions to the north being put on show at the gates of Cordoba.

Following the rebellion in Cordoba, Al-Hakam established a personal bodyguard, the Al-Haras, led by the Visigothic leader of the Christians in Cordoba, the Comes (Count) Rabi, son of Theodulf, who also served as the Emir&#x27;s tax collector. Rabi was later removed and executed by crucifixion for corruption.
In 818 he crushed a rebellion led by clerics in the suburb of on the south bank of the Guadalquivir river. Some 300 notables were captured and crucified, while the rest of the inhabitants were exiled. Some moved to Alexandria in Egypt, some to Fez and Crete, where they formed an emirate. Others joined the Levantine pirates.

==Death==
Al-Hakam I died in 822 after having ruled for 26 years.

==Family==
Al-Hakam was the son of Hisham I, Emir of Cordoba and a concubine named Zokhrouf.

Al Hakam fathered five children with his wife Halawah:
* Abd ar-Rahman II, Umayyad Emir of Córdoba 822–852
* al-Mughira
* Said
* Umayya
* al-Walid bin al-Hakam. He led an army to attack Galicia in 838.

Al-Hakam had a concubine named Ajab. She established a foundation for lepers in the suburbs of Cordoba. The leper colony was funded by the proceeds of the Munyat &#x27;Ajab, an estate built for or named after Ajab.
Ajab was the mother of:
* Abu Abd Al-Malik Marwan

Another concubine was named Mut&#x27;a. She established a cemetery which was still in existence in the 10th century.

<text>A journalism school is a school or department, usually part of an established university, where journalists are trained. &#x27;J-School&#x27; is an increasingly used term for a journalism department at a school or college. 
Journalists in most parts of the world must first complete university-level training, which incorporates both technical skills such as research skills, interviewing techniques and shorthand and academic studies in media theory, cultural studies and ethics.

== Africa ==
In 2007, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) named what it terms the Potential Centres of Excellence in Journalism Training in Africa. After thorough research, there were 12 journalism and media training institutions named on the list and they were not placed in any order.

These 12 UNESCO Potential Centres of Excellence in Journalism Training in Africa are the Department of Journalism at the Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria in South Africa (TUT), Mass Communication Department at Makerere University in Uganda, School of Journalism and Media Studies at Rhodes University in Grahamstown in South Africa, Department of Mass Communication at the University of Lagos in Nigeria, School of Communication, Legal and Secretarial Studies at the Namibia Polytechnic, Mozambican School of Journalism in Mozambique, Centre d&#x27;études des sciences et techniques de l&#x27;information in Senegal, The School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Nairobi in Kenya, Department of Journalism at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa, Institut Supérieur de l&#x27;Information et de la Communication in Morocco, School of Communication Studies at Walter Sisulu University in South Africa and Ecole Supérieure de Sciences et Techniques de l&#x27;Information et de la Communication in Cameroon.

UNESCO&#x27;s list is not exhaustive, and new schools have been founded since the study was conducted.

With the rise of the Internet and social media in the past five years there has been increasing demand for journalism schools offering specialized training in the kinds of modern challenges journalists face in the rapidly changing online-media landscape. E-jicom Graduate School of Journalism and Communication in Dakar, Senegal is one such institution.

== Asia ==
The most populous continent is also home to the world&#x27;s largest democracy and its pace of growth and booming economies have led to a proliferation of media enterprises. The rise of digital publishing has created newer opportunities for employment and self-employment in the field of journalism and mass communication.

=== India ===
Unlike the rest of the world, print media continues to grow and thrive in India with its over 1.4 billion people. With over 900 TV channels and over 100,000 100,000 registered publications, digital publishing has only added to the opportunities. Dozens of regional languages and English being the aspirational language, newspapers in India are now published in 100 different languages. The government of India established the &quot;Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC)&quot; in 1965, which has now 6 campuses across India. Dozens of universities and independent institutes provide education for shaping journalism, media and mass communication professionals.

===Pakistan===
Pakistan is a large country of South Asia with a population almost 220 million people. It has all contemporary media i.e. print, electronic and social media widely used by the citizens. Each public and private university has established separate institute for imparting education in mass communication, journalism and media. Recently the Government of Pakistan has promulgated Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act 2021 in order to provide more safe and conducive working environment to the local as well as international journalists.

== Europe ==
=== Central Europe ===
The International Media Center (Slovenia-Austria-Serbia), offers in cooperation with South East Europe Media Organisation (SEEMO) and South East and Central Europe PR Organisation (SECEPRO) several courses, including master programme.

In Hungary, The Hungarian Bálint György Academy of Journalism (previously known as Hungarian School of Journalism) runs under the aegis of the National Association of Hungarian Journalists (MÚOSZ). Before 1989, the Hungarian School of Journalism served as a highly selective post-graduate program for well-trained journalists in Hungary. Since 2003, the Bálint György Academy of Journalism belongs to the accredited professional education system.

Budapest Metropolitan University was established as Budapest College of Communication in 2000 and has been providing students with journalism, communication, and media studies classes. The school is also in partnership with the Hungarian Public Television (MTVA).

=== Denmark ===
In Denmark, the University of Southern Denmark established a journalism study programme in 1998 at the then founded Centre for Journalism, as did Roskilde University, following the political decision to break the Danish School of Journalism&#x27;s monopoly on educating journalists in Denmark. The purpose was and is to increase the diversity of teaching and research within the field of journalism. Since its establishment, the Centre for Journalism has launched several innovative features within the field, including the by now renowned award for journalists, &quot;The Journalistic Fellowship&quot;, and the introduction of a journalist&#x27;s oath similar to the Hippocratic oath. Also, in terms of scientific publications it is the most productive journalism research department in Denmark (status: 2005).

=== Eastern Europe ===
In Russia, the MSU Faculty of Journalism is the leading journalism school and the world&#x27;s largest school of journalism. The majority of textbooks on journalism in Russian were written by MSU scientists. Other one is Media institute of Higher School of Economics. One of the leaders school of international journalism is faculty of international journalism of Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Vladimir Mezentsev school of journalism is the oldest media School for young journalism.

In Minsk (Belarus), the Institute of Journalism of BSU is one of the leading scientific and educational centers in the sphere of Mass Media in the territory of the former soviet countries. It possesses a highly respected scientific and pedagogical standard and prepares professionals in mass media for work in Belarus and abroad.

=== France ===
In France, 14 schools are recognized by the profession at the national level. The Paris-Panthéon-Assas University&#x27;s Centre de Formation des Journalistes (CFJ), was founded in 1946 by two Resistance leaders, although the University of Lille&#x27;s École supérieure de journalisme de Lille had been founded earlier (1924).

Other Parisian journalism schools are Sciences Po Journalism School, the Sorbonne University&#x27;s CELSA, the Paris-Panthéon-Assas University&#x27;s French Press Institute (IFP) and the PSL University&#x27;s Institut Pratique du Journalisme (IPJ).

In the different French regions : École de journalisme de Toulouse (EJT), the Bordeaux Montaigne University Institute of Journalism (IJBA), the Aix-Marseille University School of Journalism and Communication (EJCAM), the University of Strasbourg&#x27;s Centre for Journalism Education (CUEJ), the department of Journalism and Communication at the University of Rennes in Lannion or Grenoble Alpes University School of Journalism (EJDG).

Founded in 1899, the École Supérieure de Journalisme in Paris, France is a claimant for the title of the first journalism school.

=== Germany ===
During the Third Reich, the Nazis established the Reichspresseschule (Imperial School of Press), in which journalists were taught to write what the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party wanted the German public to think.

After the war, the first journalism school in Germany was founded in 1949 as Werner Friedmann Institute. 1961 the school&#x27;s name was changed into Deutsche Journalistenschule (German school of journalism). In 1979, a new journalism school was created in Hamburg, later renamed after the founder of &quot;Stern&quot; magazine, Henri Nannen.

=== Spain ===
The top journalism school in Spain according to &quot;El Mundo&quot; newspaper is the University of Navarra. It is the oldest school of journalism in Spain and among the top 10 world universities of medium size according to the QS ranking. Many reputed and well-known journalists have studied at Universidad Complutense de Madrid, one of Madrid&#x27;s most prestigious university. Princess Letizia of Spain studied journalism at this university, which is the main public university in the country. Other universities include Carlos III university, Pompeu Fabra University, Autonomous University of Barcelona and Pontifical University of Salamanca.

===United Kingdom===
Historically, in the United Kingdom entrants used first to complete a non-media-studies related degree course, giving maximum educational breadth, prior to taking a specialist postgraduate pre-entry course. However, this has changed in recent years with journalism training and education moving to higher educational institutions. There are now over 60 universities in the UK offering BA honours degrees in journalism. Postgraduate courses are more well-established, some of which are either recognised by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) or the National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ). A Diploma of Journalism was established at London University in 1919, but university journalism education in Britain did not become a significant endeavour until the 1970s, with establishment of the University of Wales postgraduate program. Most training from the mid-20th century was run by the National Council for the Training of Journalists.

The Department of Journalism Studies at the University of Sheffield is rated Number 1 in the UK by the Guardian (2019) for 
Journalism, Publishing &amp; Public Relations, and number 1 in the UK by the Times/Sunday Times (2018) for
Communication and Media Studies. The National Student Survey results for both 2009 and 2010 placed The University of Sheffield No. 1 in the UK for overall satisfaction with Journalism Studies.

Of City University London&#x27;s Journalism Department &quot;The Independent&quot; commented that City&#x27;s postgraduate courses had &quot;rightly accrued legendary status within the media.&quot; Former &quot;Guardian&quot; editor Peter Preston wrote: &quot;What&#x27;s the passport to journalism? The dreaming spires of... City University&quot;. City&#x27;s faculty includes Professors George Brock and Roy Greenslade. Alumni include Sophie Raworth of the BBC, Sky&#x27;s Dermot Murnaghan and Channel 4 News Economics Editor Faisal Islam.

Another well-established course is the highly regarded School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies at Cardiff University which was founded in 1970 by Tom Hopkinson. The course was also the UK&#x27;s top-rated course by the National Council for the Training of Journalists for the academic year 2007/8.

The University of Kent&#x27;s Centre for Journalism was established with Professor Tim Luckhurst as the first head. The Centre runs both undergraduate and postgraduate degrees that are accredited by the National Council for the Training of Journalists. and the Broadcast Journalism Training Council. The Centre offers guaranteed work placements with the KM Group. It was ranked best for undergraduate study of journalism in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s University Guide for 2015, and in &quot;The Times Good University Guide 2016&quot; in which it was ranked first for graduate employment prospects in journalism.

One of Europe&#x27;s longest established centres of journalism education is the department of Journalism, Media and Communication, University of Central Lancashire (also known as UCLan), which launched its first print journalism course in 1962 at the then Harris College, which later became part of the University of Central Lancashire. Of the school, a 2008 article in &quot;The Times&quot; observed that &quot;it is acknowledged as one of the leading centres for the teaching of journalism in Britain&quot;. In 2010, the University won the Broadcast Journalism Training Council&#x27;s award for general excellence.

The School of Journalism at the University of Lincoln was formally opened by the journalist John Pilger in 2004. It provides programmes at all degree levels. Research in the School focuses on media ethics, international human rights, the coverage of US/UK warfare, and literary journalism, with 70% of the research output assessed in 2008 as &#x27;internationally excellent&#x27; or &#x27;world leading&#x27;. Teaching emphasizes the growing focus on the convergence of platforms in the media. Courses are accredited by the BJTC and the Periodicals Training Council (PTC). and the School is &#x27;Recognised for Excellence&#x27; by the European Journalism Training Association (EJTA).

The Press Association offer a fast-track 17-week course in multimedia and print journalism (NCTJ). The short length and intensity of the course makes entry extremely competitive. It was previously owned by &quot;Trinity Mirror&quot;, and many national newspapers send trainees to take part in at least some PA training within a graduate scheme.

Liverpool John Moores and Bournemouth have well-respected journalism courses. Kingston University, Bournemouth and Birmingham City have developed fully converged journalism courses without reference to separate production disciplines such as radio, newspaper or magazine journalism. Issues from a European perspective in evaluating journalism schools were discussed by the president of the European Journalism Training Association in an interview with Marianne Peters of this Association.

The London School of Journalism (LSJ) is an independent and highly acclaimed institution with well-recognised Postgraduate programs in Journalism and writing. It was founded in 1920 by Sir Max Pemberton. Kingston University also has a well-respected department of journalism. Founded in 2003 it has courses accredited by the NCTJ and PTC. The campus newspaper and magazine produced by its journalism students have won best student publication in the national Guardian Student Media Awards.

== North America ==

=== Canada ===
In Canada, A listing (unranked) of journalism schools has been assembled by Canadian-Universities.net. Journalism schools are listed and classified on the &quot;J-Schools &amp; Programs&quot; page of the Canadian Journalism Project.

The University of British Columbia Graduate School of Journalism is one of the few graduate-only journalism schools on the continent.

=== United States ===

In the United States, the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC) applies eight standards in evaluating university programs: mission, governance and administration; curriculum and instruction; diversity and inclusiveness; full-time and part-time faculty; scholarship: research, creative and professional activity; student services; resources, facilities and equipment; professional and public service; and assessment of learning outcomes. The ACEJMC has awarded accreditation to 109 university and college programs of study in journalism and mass communications, but does not attempt to rank the courses or programs. It accredits colleges, schools, departments or divisions.

The listing of a unit as accredited indicates that the unit has been judged by ACEJMC to meet its standards. That judgment is rendered after a self-study prepared by the faculty and administration of the unit and an independent evaluation of the unit by educators and practitioners. The listing shows the bachelor&#x27;s and professional master&#x27;s degree programs that were examined during the unit&#x27;s most recent accreditation review. Some units offer degrees in addition to those listed here. ACEJMC does not accredit programs leading to the PhD, which is considered a research (and not a professional) degree. The Council does not list sequences or specialties.

University of Missouri is a claimant in the title for the first journalism school.

There are only three graduate-only journalism schools in the United States: Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, and the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.

Many universities have both graduate and undergraduate programs within dedicated professional schools. Two such examples are the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia and the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

&quot;Editor &amp; Publisher&quot; has presented an unranked list of leading journalism schools, while &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; produces annual lists of the top schools in advertising, print, and other categories based on responses to questionnaires sent to deans and faculty members. A list based on a variety of resources claims to identify the &quot;ten most popular journalism schools in the United States&quot;. One critic has pointed to the anecdotal nature of much j-school ranking in the absence of effective tracking of journalism graduates&#x27; career paths.

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, a ranking of journalism schools has been assembled based on graduating students&#x27; assessments of the quality of their courses. The ranking, based on student satisfaction ratings over four years, are Jschool Journalism College in Brisbane, University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, University of Western Sydney, Murdoch University in Western Australia and the University of Technology, Sydney. Figures indicated 100 percent satisfaction among students at Bond University and Jschool (both in Queensland), and 85 percent among students at the Universities of Canberra, Newcastle and the Sunshine Coast. Employment rates are mixed, with an estimated 20 percent of university journalism graduates achieving journalism positions in the media, although Jschool has a 63 percent employment rate. A list of journalism graduates in employment shows city-based technological universities with the highest numbers of graduates in media positions, including QUT in Brisbane, RMIT in Melbourne and UTS in Sydney. The biggest employers have been the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Channel Nine, Channel Seven, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and Special Broadcasting Service, although there has been much downsizing of newsrooms since the figures were assembled.

=== New Zealand ===
The New Zealand Training Organisation has published a list of New Zealand&#x27;s journalism schools recognised by industry.

The New Zealand Institute of Business Studies has been teaching Freelance Journalism &amp; Non-Fiction Writing for more than 20 years. Training is less &#x27;academic-focused&#x27; and more &#x27;income-earning&#x27; focused. Graduates are given a fortnightly list of journalism job vacancies.

== South America ==
An evaluation of developments in journalism education in Latin America has been undertaken by Rosental Calmon Alves.

=== Colombia ===
In Colombia, the high court determined in 1998 that journalism was not a career. This court said that journalism is a human right, not a profession.

Because of the ruling there are many schools of communications in Colombia where people study to work in mainly enterprises, but not in mass media.

There are many schools of journalism, at undergraduate level the main ones being: University of Antioquia, a public institution in Medellín, offers Journalism inside the Communications faculty, and University of Rosario in Bogotá, a private institution, offers Public Opinion Journalism, and the Externado University, a private institution, offers a degree in Social Communication and Journalism.

=== Chile ===
In Chile, universities with journalism impart the profession as a full five-year degree. With a grade of &quot;bachelor in social communications&quot; and professional title of journalist, there currently exist more than 30 journalism schools in the country. The national system has an accrediting council that independently certifies the universities as a whole and each of the careers. Nevertheless, only a few are accredited.

The top schools in the country are the Faculty of Communications of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, accredited by US&#x27;s ACEJMC, and the Institute of Communication and Image of the University of Chile, accredited by the National Accrediting Council (CNA). Outside Santiago, the top school is the School of Journalism of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso, also accredited by the CNA.

== Debate about role ==
One of the most cited critiques of a journalism school was Michael Lewis&#x27;s article in &quot;The New Republic&quot; (1993), &quot;J-school ate my brain&quot;, which was strongly criticized by University of Maryland College of Journalism dean Reese Cleghorn in &quot;American Journalism Review&quot;. Discussion of the issues raised by Lewis was evident a decade later in the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; colloquy on journalism education, &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;″s &quot;Searching for the perfect j-school&quot;, and &quot;The j-school debate&quot; in the Christian Science Monitor. Alternative approaches to journalism education were suggested in Jack Shafer&#x27;s &quot;Slate&quot; article &quot;Can J-school be saved? Professional advice for Columbia University&quot;. An article in &quot;The Australian&quot; discusses &quot;What makes a good school of journalism&quot;.

On the internet, a range of weblogs have been set up by journalism students to chronicle or to criticize their journalism colleges. Examples are: &quot;jschoolyear&quot;, &quot;jschool05&quot;, &quot;the pod&quot; blogspot, &quot;jschool&quot; blog, Australia. An example of a weblog criticising university journalism education in Australia is &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with the school&quot;. One journalism school in the UK, at the University of Westminster, has established a clearing house where all students are expected to contribute to the development and content of their own education and training using blogs.

Various commentaries on journalism education are related to criticisms of contemporary news media standards and values. One example is a paper by Jan Schaffer, executive director of J-Lab: the Institute for Interactive Journalism. A controversial paper to Australia&#x27;s peak newspaper industry body PANPA (Pacific Area Newspaper Publishers Association) by Professor John Henningham (&quot;Journalism sold short in media courses&quot;) blamed industry lack of interest and university cost-cutting for falling standards in journalism education. In Canada, Mark Anderson of the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; has argued the case for teaching business journalism in college rather than on the job. Canadian journalism professor Rick MacLean has rejected criticism by Robert Fulford (&quot;Just what is the point of j-school&quot;) that the best potential journalists will find their way into the media, while many existing j-school students show no interest in news or the media. MacLean argues that education in journalism helps empower members of the public to understand how media work.

<doc id="597450" wikidata="Q5663900" url="?curid=597450" title="Alcalde">
<text>Alcalde (; ) is the traditional Spanish municipal magistrate, who had both judicial and administrative functions. An &quot;alcalde&quot; was, in the absence of a corregidor, the presiding officer of the Castilian &quot;cabildo&quot; (the municipal council) and judge of first instance of a town. &quot;Alcaldes&quot; were elected annually, without the right to reelection for two or three years, by the &quot;regidores&quot; (council members) of the municipal council. The office of the &quot;alcalde&quot; was signified by a staff of office, which they were to take with them when doing their business. A woman who holds the office is termed an &quot;alcaldesa&quot;.

In New Spain (Mexico), &quot;alcaldes mayores&quot; were chief administrators in colonial-era administrative territories termed &quot;alcaldías mayores&quot;; in colonial-era Peru the units were called &quot;corregimientos&quot;.

&quot;Alcalde&quot; was also a title given to Indigenous (Native American) leaders inside the Spanish missions, who performed a large variety of duties for the Franciscan missionaries.

== Medieval origins ==
The office of the &quot;alcalde&quot; evolved during the Reconquista as new lands were settled by the expanding kingdoms of León and Castile. As fortified settlements in the area between the Douro and Tagus rivers became true urban centers, they gained, from their feudal lords or the kings of Leon and Castile, the right to have councils. Among the rights that these councils had was to elect a municipal judge (&quot;iudex&quot; in Latin and &quot;juez&quot; in Spanish). These judges were assisted in their duties by various assistant judges, called &quot;alcaldes&quot;, whose number depended on the number of parishes the town had. The title &quot;alcalde&quot; was borrowed from the Arabic &quot;al qaḍi&quot; (قاضي), meaning &quot;the judge.&quot;

The word &quot;alcalde&quot; originally was used for simple judges, as in Andalusian Arabic. Only later was it applied to the presiding municipal magistrate. This early use continued to be reflected in its other uses, such as &quot;alcaldes del crimen&quot;, the judges in the &quot;audiencias&quot;; &quot;Alcaldes de la Casa y Corte de Su Majestad&quot;, who formed the highest tribunal in Castile and also managed the royal court; &quot;alcaldes mayores&quot;, a synonym for corregidor; and &quot;alcaldes de barrio&quot;, who were roughly the equivalent of British parish constables. Because of this, the municipal &quot;alcalde&quot; was often referred to as an &quot;alcalde ordinario&quot;.

== The classic &quot;cabildo&quot;, fifteenth to nineteenth centuries ==
By the end of the fourteenth century the definite form of the Castilian municipal council, the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; or &quot;cabildo&quot;, had been established. The council was limited to a maximum of twenty-four members (&quot;regidores&quot;), who may be appointed for life by the crown, hold the office as an inherited possession or be elected by the citizens (&quot;vecinos&quot;) of the municipality. (Many &quot;cabildos&quot; had a mix of these different types of &quot;regidores&quot;.) The number of magistrates, now definitely called &quot;alcaldes&quot;, was limited to one or two, depending on the size of the city and who were elected annually by the &quot;regidores&quot;. To ensure control over &quot;cabildos&quot;, the Castilian monarchs often appointed a &quot;corregidor&quot;, who took over the role of the presiding officer of the council. The &quot;cabildo&quot; was taken to the Americas and Philippines by the Spanish conquistadors. Towns and villages in the Americas with the right to a council (&quot;villas&quot; and &quot;lugares&quot; in the &quot;Recopilación de las Leyes de Indias&quot;, 1680) had one &quot;alcalde&quot;. Cities (&quot;ciudades&quot;) had two, which was the maximum number anywhere. Early in the conquest, adelantados had the right to appoint the &quot;alcaldes&quot; in the districts they settled, if they could attract the legally specified number of settlers to the area. This right could be inherited for one generation, after which the right of election returned to the municipal council.

== Modern usage ==
In modern Spanish, the term &quot;alcalde&quot; is equivalent to a mayor, and is used to mean the local executive officer in municipalities throughout Spain and Latin America. For example, the title &quot;alcalde&quot; continued to be used in the Spanish-speaking American Commonwealth of Puerto Rico after the occupation of the island during the Spanish–American War in 1898. In the autonomous Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla, however, the &quot;alcaldes-presidentes&quot; have greater powers than their peninsular colleagues.

Because the United States incorporated parts of the former Viceroyalty of New Spain, the office had some influence in the local political and legal developments of those areas and is mentioned in judicial cases. This title continued to be in use in the Southwest United States after the Mexican–American War until a permanent political and judicial system could be established. Alcaldes were notorious for their support for rule of law and opposition to vigilantes. In nineteenth-century California, Stephen Johnson Field, later an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, once served as the only &quot;alcalde&quot; of Marysville, California, a town established in 1850 during the Gold Rush by immigrants, who temporarily used the Spanish and Mexican form of municipal government. In Texas, the position of county judge was based on that of the &quot;alcalde&quot; which had existed in the state prior to the Texas Revolution. Like the &quot;alcaldes&quot; before them, county judges under the Texas Constitution wield both judicial and chief executive functions. Although in larger counties today the county judge usually functions solely as county chief executive, in smaller counties, the role of the county judge continues to have many of the combined judicial and administrative functions of the &quot;alcalde&quot;.

The city of Sonoma, California, has a tradition to name an honorary title of &quot;Alcalde/Alcaldesa&quot;, to preside over ceremonial events of the city, with &quot;mayor&quot; being the official position of city governor.

In Belize, any rural community may appoint an alcalde. The alcalde serves both judicial and administrative functions and is paid a small stipend by the government. The alcalde is responsible for managing communal land, judging disputes, and determining punishment for petty crimes. This type of local government is most commonly used by Maya communities in southern Belize.

<text>William Malcolm Dickey (June 6, 1907 – November 12, 1993) was an American professional baseball catcher and manager. He played in Major League Baseball with the New York Yankees for 17 seasons. Dickey managed the Yankees as a player-manager in 1946 in his last season as a player.

Dickey played with the Yankees from 1928 through 1943. After serving in the United States Navy during World War II, Dickey returned to the Yankees in 1946 as a player and manager. He retired after the 1946 season, but returned in 1949 as a coach, in which capacity he taught Yogi Berra the finer points of catching.

During Dickey&#x27;s playing career, the Yankees went to the World Series nine times, winning eight championships. He was named to 11 All-Star Games. He went on to briefly manage the Yankees as a player-manager, then contribute to another six Yankee World Series titles as a coach. Dickey was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1954.

==Early life==
Dickey was born in Bastrop, Louisiana, on June 6, 1907. He was one of seven children born to John and Laura Dickey. The Dickeys moved to Kensett, Arkansas, where John Dickey worked as a brakeman for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. John Dickey had played baseball for a semi-professional team based in Memphis, Tennessee. Bill&#x27;s older brother, Gus, was a second baseman and pitcher in the East Arkansas Semipro League, while his younger brother, George, would go on to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a catcher.

Dickey attended Searcy High School in Searcy, Arkansas. At Searcy, Dickey played for the school&#x27;s baseball team as a pitcher and second baseman.

==College career==
Dickey enrolled at Little Rock College, where he played guard for the school&#x27;s football team and pitcher for the baseball team. Dickey substituted for a friend on a semi-professional team based in Hot Springs, Arkansas as a catcher, impressing the team&#x27;s manager with his throwing arm. Lena Blackburne, manager of the Little Rock Travelers, a minor league baseball team, noticed Dickey while scouting an outfielder on the Hot Springs team. Blackburne signed Dickey to play for his team.

==Minor league career==
Dickey made his professional debut at the age of 18 with the Little Rock Travelers of the Class A Southern Association in 1925. Little Rock had a working agreement with the Chicago White Sox of the American League, which involved sending players between Little Rock, the Muskogee Athletics of the Class C Western Association, and the Jackson Senators of the Class D Cotton States League. Dickey played in three games for Little Rock in 1925, then was assigned to Muskogee in 1926, where he had a .283 batting average in 61 games.

Dickey returned to Little Rock, and batted .391 in 17 games at the end of the season. Dickey played in 101 games for Jackson in 1927, batting .297 with three home runs. As a fielder, Dickey compiled a .989 fielding percentage and was credited with 84 assists while he committed only nine errors.

==New York Yankees==
Jackson waived Dickey after the 1927 season. Johnny Nee, a scout for the New York Yankees, wired his boss, Ed Barrow, the Yankees&#x27; general manager, that the Yankees should claim him. The Yankees purchased Dickey from Jackson for $12,500 ($ in current dollar terms). Though he suffered from influenza during spring training in 1928, Dickey impressed Yankees manager Miller Huggins. Dickey hit .300 in 60 games for Little Rock, receiving a promotion to the Buffalo Bisons of the Class AA International League. After appearing in three games for Buffalo, Dickey made his MLB debut with the Yankees on August 15, 1928. He recorded his first hit, a triple off George Blaeholder of the St. Louis Browns, on August 24.
Dickey played his first full season in MLB in . He replaced Benny Bengough as the Yankees&#x27; starting catcher, as Bengough experienced a recurrent shoulder injury, and Dickey outperformed Bengough and Johnny Grabowski. As a rookie, Dickey hit .324 with 10 home runs and 65 runs batted in (RBI). He led all catchers with 95 assists and 13 double plays. In 1930, Dickey hit .339. In 1931, Dickey made only three errors and batted .327 with 78 RBI. That year, he was named by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; to its All-Star Team.

Although his offensive production was overshadowed by Yankee greats Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Joe DiMaggio, Dickey posted some of the finest offensive seasons ever by a catcher during the late 1930s, hitting over 20 home runs with 100 RBI in four consecutive seasons from 1936 through 1939. His 1936 batting average of .362 was the highest single-season average ever recorded by a catcher, tied by Mike Piazza of the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1997, until Joe Mauer of the Minnesota Twins hit .365 in 2009.

In 1932, Dickey broke the jaw of Carl Reynolds with one punch in a game after they collided at home plate, and received a 30-day suspension and $1,000 fine as punishment. That year, he hit .310, with 15 home runs and 84 RBI. In the 1932 World Series, he batted 7-for-16, with three walks, 4 RBI, and scored two runs.

In 1936, Dickey hit .362, finishing third in the AL behind Luke Appling (.388) and Earl Averill (.378). Dickey held out for an increase from his $14,500 salary in 1936, seeking a $25,000 salary. He ended the holdout by agreeing to a contract worth $17,500. Dickey earned $18,000 in 1939. Dickey signed a contract for 1940, receiving a $20,500 salary.

On July 26, 1939, Dickey hit three home runs against the St. Louis Browns in a 14-1 rout at Yankee Stadium.

The 1941 season marked Dickey&#x27;s thirteenth year in which he caught at least 100 games, an MLB record. He also set a double play record and led AL catchers with a .994 fielding percentage.

Dickey suffered a shoulder injury in 1942, ending his streak of catching at least 100 games in a season. When Dickey&#x27;s backup, Buddy Rosar, left the team without permission to take examinations to join the Buffalo police force and to be with his wife who was about to have a baby, Yankees manager Joe McCarthy signed Rollie Hemsley to be the second string catcher, relegating Rosar to the third string position. Dickey saw his playing time decrease with the addition of Hemsley. He returned for the 1942 World Series, but was considered to be fading.

Dickey had a terrific season in 1943, batting .351 in 85 games and hitting the title-clinching home run in the 1943 World Series. After the season, the 36 year-old Dickey was honored as the player of the year by the New York chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America.

==Manager and coach==
Dickey was rumored to be a candidate for the managerial position with the Philadelphia Phillies after the 1943 season.

Dickey entered the United States Navy on March 15, 1944, as he was categorized in Class 1-A, meaning fit for service, by the Selective Service System. He served at the Navy Hospital Area in Hawaii. He was discharged in January 1946 as a lieutenant senior grade; one of his main tasks had been to organize recreational activities in the Pacific.

Returning to the Yankees in 1946, Dickey became the player-manager of the Yankees in the middle of the season after Joe McCarthy resigned. The Yankees did fairly well under Dickey&#x27;s watch, going 57–48. However, owner Larry MacPhail refused to give Dickey a new contract until after the season. Rather than face the possibility of being a lame-duck manager, the 39 year-old Dickey resigned on September 12, but remained as a player. He retired after the season, having compiled 202 home runs, 1,209 RBIs and a .313 batting average over his career.

In 1947, Dickey managed the Travelers. The team finished with a 51–103 record, last in the Southern Association. Dickey returned to the Yankees in 1949 as first base coach and catching instructor to aid Yogi Berra in playing the position. Already a good hitter, Berra became an excellent defensive catcher. With Berra having inherited his uniform number 8, Dickey wore number 33 until the 1960 season. Dickey later instructed Elston Howard on catching, when Berra moved to the outfield.

===Managerial record===
==Film career==
While still an active player in 1942, Dickey appeared as himself in the film &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot;, which starred Gary Cooper as the Yankee captain and first baseman Lou Gehrig. Late in the movie, when Gehrig was fading due to the disease that would eventually take his life, a younger Yankee grumbled in the locker room, &quot;the old man on first needs crutches to get around!&quot;—and Dickey, following the script, belted the younger player, after which he said the kid &quot;talked out of turn.&quot;

Dickey also appeared as himself in the film &quot;The Stratton Story&quot; in 1949. In the film, Dickey was scripted to take a called third strike from Jimmy Stewart&#x27;s character. Dickey objected, stating &quot;I never took a third strike. I always swung&quot;, and asking the director, Sam Wood, to allow him to swing through the third strike; Wood insisted that Dickey take the third strike. After many takes, Dickey commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve struck out more times this morning than I did throughout my entire baseball career.&quot;

==Personal life==

On October 5, 1932, Dickey married Violet Arnold, a New York showgirl, at St. Mark&#x27;s Church in Jackson Heights, New York. The couple had one child, Lorraine, born in 1935.

At the time of Lou Gehrig&#x27;s death, Dickey described Gehrig as his best friend.

Dickey was an excellent quail hunter. He spent part of his retirement in the 1970s and 1980s residing in the Yarborough Landing community on the shore of Millwood Lake in southwestern Arkansas. He died in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1993.

==Legacy==

Dickey was noted for his excellent hitting and his ability to handle pitchers. He was also known for his relentlessly competitive nature.

Dickey was inducted into the Hall of Fame in . In 1972, the Yankees retired the number 8 in honor of Dickey and Berra. On August 22, 1988, the Yankees honored both Dickey and Berra by hanging plaques honoring them in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. Dickey opined that Berra was &quot;An elementary Yankee&quot; who is &quot;considered the greatest catcher of all time.&quot;

Dickey was named in 1999 to The Sporting News list of Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Players, ranking number 57, trailing Johnny Bench (16), Josh Gibson (18), Yogi Berra (40), and Roy Campanella (50) among catchers. Like those catchers, Dickey was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team, but the fan balloting chose Berra and Bench as the two catchers on the team.

In 2007, Dickey-Stephens Park opened in North Little Rock, Arkansas. The ballpark was named after Bill; his brother George; and two famous Arkansas businessmen, Jackson and Witt Stephens.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Dickey as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

<doc id="597469" wikidata="Q823360" url="?curid=597469" title="Boulton Paul Aircraft">
<text>Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd was a British aircraft manufacturer that was incorporated in 1934, although its origins in aircraft manufacturing began earlier in 1914 and lasted until 1961. The company mainly built and modified aircraft under contract to other manufacturers, but had a few notable designs of its own, such as the Defiant fighter and the Balliol trainer.

The company&#x27;s origins date back to an ironmonger&#x27;s shop founded in 1797 in Norwich. By the early 1900s, Boulton &amp; Paul Ltd was a successful general manufacturing firm with a construction engineering division. It began building aircraft under contract during the First World War before moving into designing and building its own aircraft. 

The aircraft building business was sold off - at a low point in the aviation market - from the main construction business in 1934 and then moved to Wolverhampton under its new name Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd in 1936 to take advantage of skilled local workforce and local government incentives.

By 1961 Boulton Paul Aircraft was a manufacturer of aircraft equipment rather than aircraft, it merged with the Dowty Group.

== History ==

Boulton &amp; Paul started its construction engineering division in 1905.

In 1915, Boulton &amp; Paul began to construct aircraft under contract, including 550 of the Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2b. During the war the company built more Sopwith Camels than any other manufacturer. Success as an aircraft builder led the company to form a design department but none of its resulting aircraft made a significant impact while the war lasted. Boulton Paul&#x27;s chief aircraft designer was John Dudley North (1893–1968), who joined the company from Austin Motor Company Aircraft Department.

After World War I, Boulton &amp; Paul made their mark with the introduction of powered and enclosed defensive machine gun turrets for bombers. Their Sidestrand twin-engined biplane bomber, which could fly at , had an exposed nose turret which was clearly inadequate. The subsequent Overstrand bomber featured the world&#x27;s first enclosed, power-operated turret, mounting a single Lewis gun and propelled by compressed air. The company licensed a French design of an electro-hydraulic four-gun turret which became a major feature of their future production. In addition to fitting turrets to bombers, Boulton Paul was to install them in fighters.
During this period Boulton &amp; Paul continued to operate outside the aircraft industry as well. They manufactured equipment such as machine tools and stationary engines. The latter were also available coupled to a dynamo for powering electric lighting circuits, and were sold under the Electolite brand name.

In 1934, Boulton &amp; Paul sold their &quot;Aircraft Department&quot; which became Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd. Over the next couple of years a new factory site was built up in Wolverhampton. This gave access to a large skilled workforce on top of the 600 or so employees that left Norwich for Wolverhampton. Even so, Boulton Paul would later set up a training centre in Scotland to bring in extra workers. The first &quot;turret&quot; fighter to be built was some of the Hawker Demon. This was followed by Boulton Paul&#x27;s most famous aircraft, the Defiant, which was a revolutionary but flawed concept specified by the Air Ministry – a &quot;fast&quot; fighter with no fixed forward armament but a powerful four-gun dorsal turret at a time when most interceptors had only two machine guns. Turret fighters were expected to be able to work together to engage undefended enemy bombers from any aspect, concentrating their fire. In practice, once Germany defeated France in 1940 their high performance but short range fighters were able to escort bombers. The same concept was used for the Defiant&#x27;s naval equivalent, the Blackburn Roc, which while a design by Blackburn, the detail design was done in BP&#x27;s drawing office and the aircraft was built wholly by Boulton Paul.

Boulton Paul also built the Fairey Barracuda and did conversions of the Vickers Wellington. The only post-war design was the Balliol advanced trainer, of which 229 were built, including 30 as the Sea Balliol deck-landing trainer.

In the jet age, Boulton Paul worked on the English Electric Canberra and de Havilland Vampire. It designed and built a couple of delta-wing jet-engined aircraft for research work and continued to tender designs for official requirements. In 1961 the company was acquired by Dowty Group and was renamed Dowty Boulton Paul Ltd and then Dowty Aerospace.

Following the acquisition of Dowty Aerospace by TI Group in 1992, and the subsequent merger of Smiths Industries and the TI group in 2000, to form Smiths Group, the Wolverhampton factory site was sold again in May 2007 to GE Aviation Systems. Yet again in August 2009 the factory was sold to Moog Inc. but was to move to new premises at the nearby I54 business park. The factory also had an on-site Boulton Paul Museum dedicated to Boulton Paul aircraft and the traditional methods used to manufacture aircraft. The important collection was scheduled to move to Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Spring 2013. Short video of the move captured April 28,2013.

== Boulton Paul gun turrets ==

Boulton Paul was one of the two main innovators of gun turret designs for British aircraft, along with Nash &amp; Thompson; they supplied large numbers of installations for British aircraft. Boulton Paul&#x27;s designs were largely based on originals licensed from the French company (SAMM), while Nash &amp; Thompson designs originated from the firm&#x27;s co-founder, Archibald Frazer-Nash (and were known by FN designations) Boulton Paul&#x27;s turrets were electro-hydraulic in operation; electric motors located in the turret drove hydraulic pumps that powered hydraulic motors and rams. This was more effective than electric motors alone, and did not require hydraulic power developed by pumps on the aircraft&#x27;s engines system utilized by the Nash &amp; Thompson design. Production was transferred to Joseph Lucas Ltd.

<text>The Vendée Globe is a single-handed (solo) non-stop, unassisted round the world yacht race. The race was founded by Philippe Jeantot in 1989, and since 1992 has taken place every four years. It is named after the Département of Vendée, in France, where the race starts and ends. The Vendée Globe is considered an extreme quest of individual endurance and the ultimate test in ocean racing.

== The race ==
=== History ===
The race was founded as &quot;The Globe Challenge&quot; in 1989 by French yachtsman Philippe Jeantot. Jeantot had competed in the BOC Challenge in 1982–83 and 1986–87, winning the 60-foot class (&quot;Class I&quot;) both times. The BOC Challenge was sailed in stages with sailors being given the chance to rest and repair their boats at ports around the world.Unsatisfied with the race&#x27;s format, he decided to set up a new round-the-world non-stop race, which he felt would be the ultimate challenge for single-handed sailors.

The first race was run in 1989–90, and was won by Titouan Lamazou; Jeantot himself took part, and placed fourth. The next race was in 1992–93; and it has since then been run every four years. The inaugural race included 11 Frenchmen, one South African (Bertie Reed) and one American (Mike Plant).

=== Yachts ===
The race is open to monohull yachts conforming to the Open 60 class criteria. Prior to 2004, the race was also open to Open 50 boats. The Open classes are unrestricted in certain aspects, but a box rule governs parameters such as overall length, draught, appendages and stability, as well as numerous other safety features.

The race presents significant challenges; most notable are the severe wind and wave conditions in the Southern Ocean, the long unassisted duration of the race, and the fact that the course takes competitors far from the reach of any normal emergency response. A significant proportion of the entrants usually retire, and in the 1996–97 race Canadian Gerry Roufs was lost at sea.

=== Course ===
The race starts and finishes in Les Sables-d&#x27;Olonne, in the Département of Vendée, in France; both Les Sables d’Olonne and the Vendée Conseil Général are official race sponsors. The course is essentially a circumnavigation along the clipper route: from Les Sables d’Olonne, down the Atlantic Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope; then clockwise around Antarctica, keeping Cape Leeuwin and Cape Horn to port; then back to Les Sables d’Olonne. The race generally covers approximately and runs from November to February, timed to place the competitors in the Southern Ocean during the austral summer.
Additional waypoints may be set in the sailing instructions for a particular race, to ensure safety relative to ice conditions, weather, etc. There is also an exclusion zone set around Antarctica where competitors are prohibited to sail due to risk of icebergs.

The competitors may stop at anchor, but may not draw alongside a quay or another vessel; they may receive no outside assistance, including customised weather or routing information. The only exception is that a competitor who has an early problem may return to the start for repairs and then restart the race, as long as the restart is within 10 days of the official start.

=== Qualification ===

To mitigate the risks, competitors are required to undergo medical and survival courses. They must also be able to demonstrate prior racing experience; either a completed single-handed trans-oceanic race or the completion of a previous Vendée Globe. The qualifying race must have been completed on the same boat as the one the sailor will race in the Vendée Globe; or the competitor must complete an additional trans-oceanic observation passage, of not less than , at an average speed of at least , with his or her boat.

<text>Cataguases is a municipality located in the southeastern part of the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. The estimated population in 2020 was 75,540. It is mainly an industrial centre (textile, metallurgy, clothes) with a strong influence of coffee plantation in its early history (19th century).

== History ==
In the 1920s, the city was associated with the Brazilian cinema pioneer Humberto Mauro and a generation of writers for the short-lived Revista Verde. Humberto Mauro shot there some films that earned him a good reputation nationwide. He later made &quot;Braza Dormida&quot; (&quot;Sleeping Fire&quot;) and &quot;O Descobrimento do Brasil&quot; (&quot;The Finding of Brazil&quot;) and was a reputed Tupi language scholar.

Industrialisation changed the town significantly and caused some of its citizens to become very rich in the 1920s and 1930s. As a result the city centre was remodeled accordingly to the ultimate architecture styles. The architect Oscar Niemeyer and painters Cândido Portinari, Djanira and Emeric Marcier are some of the Brazilian artists who left contributions there at that time.

After three decades of wealth, the town lost its prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. The economic crisis and the changes due to the modernisation of the industries provoked high unemployment rates and depreciation of salaries, reducing the town&#x27;s wealth.

In 2003, the town was the site of an ecological accident caused by the spilling of chemical waste that affected the brook Cágado and the rivers Pomba and Paraíba do Sul, threatening the water supply of more than 20,000,000 Brazilians (including the state of Rio de Janeiro).

==Geography==
===Climate===
Cataguases experiences a tropical savanna climate (Aw under Köppen climate classification). Temperatures are high (above 18 °C (64.4 °F)) all over the year, and low temperatures lasting for a whole day are rare, and generally only occur in the dry season. The wet season starts in September and goes until May, while the dry season goes from May to September. Floods are not uncommon in the town, and generally there is one per year, in December, January or February. On the other side, during the dry season Rio Pomba has considerably less water than in other periods, and some people have respiratory diseases related to low air humidity.

<doc id="597481" wikidata="Q357172" url="?curid=597481" title="Jan Ladislav Dussek">
<text>Jan Ladislav Dussek (baptized Jan Václav Dusík, with surname also written as Duschek or Düssek; 12 February 176020 March 1812) was a Czech classical period composer and virtuoso pianist. He was an important representative of Czech music abroad in the second half of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. Some of his more forward-looking piano works have traits often associated with Romanticism.

Dussek was one of the first piano virtuosos to travel widely throughout Europe. He performed at courts and concert venues from London to Saint Petersburg to Milan, and was celebrated for his technical prowess. During a nearly ten-year stay in London, he was instrumental in extending the size of the pianoforte, and was the recipient of one of John Broadwood&#x27;s first 6-octave pianos, CC-c4. Harold Schonberg wrote that he was the first pianist to sit at the piano with his profile to the audience, earning him the appellation &quot;le beau visage.&quot; All subsequent pianists have sat on stage in this manner. He was one of the best-regarded pianists in Europe before Beethoven&#x27;s rise to prominence.

His music is marked by lyricism interrupted by sudden dynamic contrasts. As well as his many compositions for the piano, he also composed for the harp: his music for that instrument contains a great variety of figuration within a largely diatonic harmony, avoids chromatic passages. His music is considered standard repertoire for all harpists, particularly his Six Sonatas/Sonatinas and especially the Sonata in C minor. Less well known to the general public than that of his more renowned Classical period contemporaries, his piano music is highly valued by many teachers and not infrequently programmed. Franz Liszt has been called an indirect successor of Dussek in the composition and performance of virtuoso piano music. His music remained popular to some degree in 19th-century Great Britain and the USA, some still in print, with more available in period editions online.

==Life==
===Early years===
The Dussek family had a long history as professional musicians, starting at least as early as Jan Ladislav&#x27;s grandfather Jan Josef Dusík (b. 1712), and lasting in the Moravian branch of the family at least into the 1970s. Jan Ladislav&#x27;s mother, Veronika Dusíková (née Štěbetová), played the harp, an instrument, along with the piano, for which her son went on to write much music. His father, Jan Josef, was also a well-known organist and composer. His sister, Katerina Veronika Anna Dusíkova, was also a musician and composer.

Jan Ladislav, the oldest of three children, was born on 12 February 1760 in the Bohemian town of Čáslav, where his father taught and played the organ. His first musical instruction came from his father, who began teaching him piano at 5, and organ at age 9. His voice was also found to be good, so he also sang in the church choir.
He studied music at the Jesuit gymnasium in Jihlava, where he studied with Ladislav Špinar, its choir director; his grades were reported to be poor. From 1774 to 1776 he studied at the Jesuit gymnasium in Kutná Hora, where he also served as organist in the Santa Barbara Jesuit church. In 1776 he went to the New City Gymnasium in Prague, where he was again reported to be a lazy student. In 1777 he enrolled in the University of Prague, where he lasted one semester.

===Netherlands and Hamburg===
After these early studies in Bohemia he entered the services of one Captain Männer, an Austrian military man, in 1778. Dussek traveled with the Captain to what has since become Belgium in 1779, where he became the organist at the St. Rumbold&#x27;s cathedral in Mechelen. In Mechelen he gave his first public recital, playing his own compositions. He then travelled to the Dutch Republic, where a well-received concert in Amsterdam brought him to the royalty&#x27;s attention. He was invited to The Hague, where he gave lessons to the three children of Stadtholder William V. While at the Hague he gave a performance before Kaiser Joseph II of Austria, who acknowledged Dussek&#x27;s prowess.

By 1782, after leaving Männer&#x27;s service, he was in Hamburg, where he gave a concert on the &quot;new English fortepiano&quot;. While in Hamburg, he may have studied with C. P. E. Bach. He also published his first works, three piano concertos and 3 violin sonatas (C 2–7), all of which were assigned Opus 1.

===Eastern and Central Europe===
From Hamburg he moved to St. Petersburg, where he was a favorite of Catherine the Great. While there he was introduced to a technician named Hessel, who had developed a keyboard version of the glass harmonica, an instrument Dussek went on to master. Dussek was forced to leave Russia quite abruptly, just ahead of Catherine&#x27;s secret police, amid suspicions of his involvement in a plot to assassinate Catherine. In a possibly apocryphal tale surrounding his departure, he was en route to play for Catherine when he found a ring, which he put on. Catherine recognized the ring as belonging to a known conspirator, raising her suspicions about Dussek.
After Dussek left St. Petersburg, he took a position as music director for Prince Antoni Radziwiłł in Lithuania, where he stayed about a year. His departure from Lithuania may have been prompted by an affair he was rumored to have with the Prince&#x27;s wife, the Princess of Thurn und Taxis. He toured Germany for the next few years as a virtuoso performer on the piano and on the glass harmonica, eventually arriving in Paris in 1786. The German tour was a significant success for him. One review of a Berlin concert said, &quot;He obtained great distinction as a pianist, and was little less admired for his playing on the [glass] harmonica ... some critics pretend to trace to his skill upon this instrument many of his specialities of style both as a pianist and composer&quot;. Another reviewer wrote, of a concert in Kassel, &quot;He entranced all listeners with a slow, harmonic, and studiously modulated prelude and chorale.&quot; He may also have been in Ludwigslust in 1786, where he would have performed his &quot;Extract from an Easter Canata&quot; (C 26) for the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

===France and Italy===
In Paris Dussek became a favorite of Marie Antoinette, who tried to dissuade him from going on a performing tour to Milan in 1788. However, she was unsuccessful, as Dussek wanted to visit his brother Franz in Milan. Dussek&#x27;s trip to Milan was quite successful; his performances &quot;produce[d] quite a sensation&quot;. He returned to Paris, where he stayed until shortly before the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789. During his time in Paris he may have met and played with a violinist by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte. He also published a series of violin sonatas (C 27–29) dedicated to Eugénie de Beaumarchais, daughter of writer Pierre Beaumarchais.

===London===

Dussek left France for England in May or June 1789, where he settled in London. It is sometimes alleged that he took with him the harpist wife of the composer Jean-Baptiste Krumpholtz, who drowned himself in the Seine as a consequence; however, this is likely untrue, as Anne-Marie Krumpholtz went to London in 1788. It is also uncertain whether he left Paris &quot;because&quot; of the looming crisis in France, or if it was merely coincidental. Early biographers have generally claimed that he left because of the impending revolution. He is reported to have had a concert engagement in London in early June 1789; this would have required his departure from Paris before some of the critical steps early in the Revolution.

Dussek made London his home until 1799. By 1790 he was well established as a performer and teacher. He was in such demand that Davison, in an 1860 biographic sketch, noted that &quot;he became one of the most fashionable professors of the day, and his lessons were both sought with avidity and remunerated at a rate of payment which knew no precedent except in the instance of John Cramer.&quot; He had also established a relationship with pianomaker John Broadwood, taking delivery of one of the first 5½ octave pianos (FF-c4): Broadwood noted in his business journal for 13 November 1793: &quot;We have made some 5 ½ octave grands these three years past, the first to please Dussek, which being liked, Cramer junior had one&quot;. His collaboration with Broadwood would continue to bear fruit when, in 1794, he also received the first 6-octave (CC-c4) piano
In the spring of 1791, Dussek appeared in a series of concerts, a number of which featured Sophia, the young daughter of music publisher Domenico Corri. In a concert on 15 June that year, the pair played a piano duet together; they were married in September 1792. Sophia Corri was a singer, pianist, and harpist who became known in her own right. They had a daughter, Olivia, but the marriage was not happy, involving liaisons by both parties.

Some of the concerts in 1791 and 1792 featured both Dussek and Joseph Haydn; the older Haydn wrote quite favorably of Dussek in a letter to the latter&#x27;s father following one of the 1792 concerts. The other highlights of 1792 (above and beyond his marriage to Sophia) included the beginning of a music publishing venture with Sophia&#x27;s father Domenico. This business, while successful at first, fared poorly in later years, and the circumstances of its failure spurred Dussek to leave London in 1799, leaving Corri in debtors&#x27; prison.

Dussek&#x27;s business acumen apparently had little impact on his performing and composing while in London. Every year, he performed in a series of concerts, at least some of which also featured Sophia, and which frequently featured new works. Some works were so successful they were repeated at later concerts in the series. Of one work, a reviewer wrote in 1798, &quot;Dussek&#x27;s Military Concerto was repeated. We think it very deserving of encomium.&quot; The concerto (C 153), which the reviewer reported as having been a repeat performance, was played &quot;again&quot; the following week.

In 1796, Dussek and his wife began having serious marital troubles. In an account of uncertain veracity, it was reported that Sophia, who had fallen in love with another man, asked Dussek for money to repair her harp. She then used the money to leave the house, removing her belongings in her harp case, and claiming to have left for dinner with a female friend. A suspicious Dussek went with his father-in-law to the man&#x27;s house, where Sophia locked herself in. She and Dussek argued, and she cursed him, claiming to be pregnant by the other man. Dussek, relenting, promised her freedom to do what she wanted; this led to a reconciliation of sorts. It seems unlikely that Dussek ever saw Sophia and his daughter Olivia after he left London in 1799; Sophia had to wait until she knew Dussek had died before she could remarry, which she did in 1812.

Some of Dussek&#x27;s compositions included arrangements of operatic and theatrical overtures for piano. He decided to try his hand at opera in 1798; the result was The Captive of Spilberg, with a libretto by Prince Hoare. The opera opened at Drury Lane on 14 November 1798, and the music was well received, with the &quot;European Magazine&quot;&#x27;s critic writing, &quot;the music, by Mr. Dussek, was such as to intitle him to rank with the first composers of the time.&quot;


====Business failure====
In 1799, the business venture with Corri, which had never been very successful, ran into financial difficulties. Dussek and Corri managed to convince the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte to lend them money to cover their debts. The failure to repay this debt put Corri into Newgate Prison and caused Dussek to flee. Da Ponte believed that Dussek fled to Paris; in fact he returned to Hamburg. The affair ended up bankrupting both Corri and Da Ponte.

Dussek then toured Germany, where he became one of the first &quot;glamour&quot; pianists, preceding Franz Liszt. According to Louis Spohr, Dussek was the first to turn the piano sideways on the stage &quot;so that the ladies could admire his handsome profile.&quot; Before long he took up a position with Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, who treated him more as a friend and colleague than as an employee. Together, they sometimes enjoyed what were called &quot;musical orgies.&quot; When Prince Louis Ferdinand was killed in the Battle of Saalfeld, Dussek wrote the moving Sonata in F sharp minor, &quot;Elégie harmonique&quot;, Op. 61 (C 211).

===Later years===
In 1807, despite his earlier affiliation with Marie Antoinette, Dussek returned to Paris in the employ of Talleyrand, the powerful French foreign minister. Having no doubt made the acquaintance of Sébastien Érard in London, he became closely associated with the Érard brothers&#x27; piano-making activities, signing an Érard grand piano of 1808 still to be seen at Talleyrand&#x27;s château at Valençay, and giving the first public performance on their new stirrup-action grand in 1810. He wrote a powerful sonata (Sonata in A flat major, Op. 64, C 221) called &quot;Le Retour à Paris&quot; (The Return to Paris). This imposing sonata also received the nickname &quot;Plus Ultra&quot; in heated response to a piano sonata by Joseph Woelfl, said to be the last word in pianistic difficulties, entitled &quot;Non Plus Ultra&quot;. The remainder of his life he spent performing, teaching and composing in Prussia and France. His personal beauty had faded and he became grossly fat. He also developed a fondness for strong drink which probably hastened his death. Dussek died of gout on 20 March 1812, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

== Style ==
Dussek was a predecessor of the Romantic composers for piano, especially Chopin, Schumann and Mendelssohn. Many of his works are strikingly at odds with the prevailing late Classical style of other composers of the time like Beethoven, Hummel, and Schubert. The evolution of style found in Dussek&#x27;s piano writing suggests he pursued an independent line of development, one that anticipated but did not influence early Romanticism.

His more notable works include several large-scale solo piano pieces, piano sonatas, many piano concertos, sonatas for violin and piano, a musical drama, and various works of chamber music, including a &quot;Trio for piano, horn and violin&quot;, and the highly unusual sonata for piano, violin, cello and percussion entitled &quot;The Naval Battle and Total Defeat of the Dutch by Admiral Duncan&quot; (1797, C 152), which is an extremely rare example of pre-20th-century chamber music that includes percussion.

=== Solo piano works ===
Dussek was one of a number of foreign-born composers, including Muzio Clementi and John Field, who contributed significantly to the development of a distinct &quot;London&quot; school of pianoforte composition. In part, this was due to the particular nature of piano manufacture in England. Joseph Haydn, for instance, composed his famous E-flat sonata after playing a piano of greater range lent to him by Dussek. Much of Dussek&#x27;s piano writing drew upon the more modulable and powerful tonal qualities and greater keyboard range of English-manufactured pianofortes. The enhanced possibilities offered by the instrument help explain some of his stylistic innovations.

Dussek wrote numerous solo piano works, including 34 Piano Sonatas as well as a number of programmatic compositions. His &quot;The Sufferings of the Queen of France&quot; (composed in 1793, C 98), for example, is an episodic account of Marie Antoinette with interpolated texts relating to the Queen&#x27;s misfortunes, including her sorrow at being separated from her children and her final moments on the scaffold before the guillotine.

Along with Clementi, Dussek may have been a source of stylistic inspiration and influence for Beethoven, whose expansion upon the idiomatic innovations of the London school led to their rapid penumbration with the appearance of Beethoven&#x27;s own keyboard works. Stylistic, melodic, dynamic and even structural similarities have been observed, for instance, between Beethoven&#x27;s Sonata Opus 10, No. 3 and Dussek&#x27;s Sonatas Opus 31, No. 2 and Opus 35, No. 2. Similarly, the opening of Beethoven&#x27;s Sonata Opus 10, No. 1 quotes directly Dussek&#x27;s Sonata Opus 39, No. 3 (see image).

It is also possible that Dussek&#x27;s influence can be seen in Beethoven&#x27;s famous Sonata Opus 81a, &quot;les Adieux&quot;: &quot;both the program and the realization owed a great deal to Dussek&#x27;s The Farewell, Opus 44.&quot;

=== Piano concertos ===

Dussek composed a number of piano concertos between 1779 and 1810, eighteen of which survive. Dussek introduced one noteworthy stylistic innovation to the piano concerto form. In variance with the prevailing classical concerto style, exemplified by Mozart&#x27;s piano concertos, Dussek eliminated the soloist cadenza in the opening movement in all of his concertos written after 1792. Other individual characteristics are also noteworthy. His Concerto in C major, Op. 29, published in 1795, starts with an introductory Larghetto in 3/8 time, a solemn thematic declamation that is unique to the classical concerto. His last surviving work in the genre, Opus 70 in E-flat major, was one of the first to lengthen substantially the opening movement: at 570 measures long, it is roughly a third longer than his previous contributions, and foreshadows the practice of a dominant opening movement in concerto writing, found, for example, in the concertos of Chopin and the two minor concerti Opus 85 and Opus 89 by Johann Nepomuk Hummel as well as Beethoven&#x27;s fifth.

==Innovations to the piano==
Apart from his own music, Dussek is important in the history of music because of his friendship with John Broadwood, the developer of the &quot;English Action&quot; piano. Because his own music demanded strength and range not available in the then current pianos, he pushed Broadwood into several extensions of the range and sonority of the instrument. It was a Broadwood instrument with Dussek&#x27;s improvements that was sent to Beethoven.

Dussek was also the first composer to write indications for using piano pedals.

==Works list==

The vast majority of Dussek&#x27;s music involves the piano or harp in some way. He wrote 35 sonatas for piano and 11 for piano duet, as well as numerous other works for both configurations. His chamber music output includes 65 violin sonatas, 24 piano (or harp) trios, and a variety of works for harp, harp or piano, or harp and piano. Some sonatas had trio parts added by J. B. Cramer. Orchestral works were limited to concertos, including 16 for piano (one of them had lost and two of them are remained dubious attribution), six for harp (three of them lost), and one for two pianos. He wrote a modest number of vocal works, include 12 songs, a cantata, a mass, and one opera, &quot;The Captive of Spilberg&quot;. His compositions also included arrangements of other works, especially opera overtures, for piano.

Cataloging Dussek&#x27;s compositions has a history of its own. Dussek&#x27;s oeuvre has historically been difficult to organize, due in part to the number of publishers who originally published his work, and to the fact that some of his works were published by more than one publisher. Some works published by multiple publishers were assigned different opus numbers; sometimes different works were given then same opus number by different publishers. Dussek further complicated this by arranging works for different instrument combinations.

The Artaria Company published a thematic catalog of his works that is incomplete, prompting Howard Craw to develop a new thematic catalog in 1964. Works are numbered in the order they were written prefixed by &quot;C&quot; or &quot;Craw&quot;; works of dubious origin are listed in a separately numbered section prefixed by &quot;Craw D&quot;.

<doc id="597499" wikidata="Q553244" url="?curid=597499" title="Nikolai Khabibulin">
<text>Nikolai Alexandrovich Khabibulin (; , born January 13, 1973) is a Russian professional ice hockey goaltender. Known by the nickname &quot;The Bulin Wall&quot;, he spent the majority of his playing career in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Winnipeg Jets, Phoenix Coyotes, Chicago Blackhawks, Tampa Bay Lightning, and Edmonton Oilers.

Khabibulin excelled at the international level, winning two Olympic medals (gold and bronze) and was named Best Goaltender at the 2002 Winter Olympics. He was the first Russian goaltender to win the Stanley Cup, doing so with Tampa Bay in 2004; until 2020, he was also the only Russian goaltender to start in the Finals. He is also a four-time NHL All-Star.

==Playing career==
===Winnipeg Jets/Phoenix Coyotes (1994–99)===
Khabibulin was selected in the ninth round of the 1992 NHL Entry Draft by the Winnipeg Jets. In the 1993–94 season, he played with the touring Russian Penguins and by the start of the NHL season in January 1995, was playing in the NHL. In 1996, he moved with the Jets to Phoenix, Arizona, where they became the Phoenix Coyotes. In five years with the Jets/Coyotes franchise, he started at least 60 games in three of those seasons (including two instances in which he played 70 games), a heavy workload for a goaltender. Although the team made the Stanley Cup playoffs each of these years, some claimed that their first-round exits were partly due to Khabibulin being fatigued from playing so many regular season games.

After the 1998–99 season, Khabibulin became embroiled in a bitter contract dispute with the Coyotes, and ended up holding out for an entire season. During this year, he played for the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the International Hockey League (IHL), earning the James Gatschene Memorial Trophy as league MVP.

===Tampa Bay Lightning (2001–2004)===
On March 5, 2001, Khabibulin was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Mike Johnson, Paul Mara, Ruslan Zainullin and the New York Islanders&#x27; second-round choice (previously acquired; Phoenix selected Matthew Spiller). Khabibulin quickly signed a contract with Tampa Bay and by the next season, he re-emerged as a premier goaltender. At the 2002 NHL All-Star Game his flawless, 20-save third period allowed the World All-Stars to rally for a comeback 8–5 win. Though Éric Dazé of the Chicago Blackhawks was chosen as the All-Star MVP, Khabibulin&#x27;s play was the talk of both locker rooms. Indeed, many players were surprised that Khabibulin wasn&#x27;t named MVP, an honour they felt was deserved and obvious. MVP voting was allegedly conducted with about five minutes remaining in the game while the North American All-Stars still held the lead.

Joined by budding superstars Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis and Brad Richards, Khabibulin helped lead the Lightning back to the playoffs in 2003, their first appearance since 1996, and then to the Stanley Cup in 2004, the first in franchise history. Khabibulin recorded five shutouts in 23 playoff games, including three shutouts in the first-round match-up against the New York Islanders (tied for an NHL record for most shutouts in a playoff round). Unlike his time in Phoenix, Khabibulin could enjoy extended rest when needed due to the skill of his backup, John Grahame.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Khabibulin was one of many Russian players to return to their homeland. From November 2004, he played for Ak Bars Kazan in Kazan.

===Chicago Blackhawks (2005–2009)===

As the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) ratified a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA), Khabibulin became a free agent when play was set to resume. Coming off his Stanley Cup win the previous NHL season, the Chicago Blackhawks signed him to a four-year, $27 million deal, making him the highest paid goaltender in the League. Injuries and inconsistent play, however, plagued him during his tenure in Chicago. In his first season with the Blackhawks, he recorded a 3.35 goals against average (GAA) — the highest of his career since his rookie season in Winnipeg — and Chicago finished second-to-last in the Western Conference.

In July 2008, the Blackhawks signed goaltender Cristobal Huet, previously of the Washington Capitals. The signing of Huet was thought to have effectively displaced Khabibulin as the starting goaltender, especially given he was put on waivers on September 29, 2008, but cleared. In light of Huet and Khabibulin&#x27;s combined salaries (Huet was signed to a contract averaging $5.6 million per season), it was speculated Khabibulin would be traded to provide cap space. However, he spent the entire season with the team, playing in 42 games, and by the start of the 2009 playoffs, he had retrenched himself as starting goaltender. Khabibulin and the Blackhawks defeated the Calgary Flames and Vancouver Canucks to progress to the Western Conference Finals against the Detroit Red Wings. During the third game of the series, Khabibulin surrendered three goals in one period after shutting out the Red Wings in the previous period. He was replaced by Huet for the third period due to a lower body injury. Khabibulin missed the remaining three games of the series as a result of the injury.

===Edmonton Oilers (2009–2013)===

On July 1, 2009, Khabibulin signed a four-year, $15 million contract with the Edmonton Oilers, replacing Dwayne Roloson as the Oilers&#x27; starting goaltender.

His Oilers debut on October 3 against the Calgary Flames was a blunder, however. While trying to field a clearing pass in the final minute of the third period, he mishandled the puck and gave up the game-winning goal to Flames&#x27; right wing David Moss.

On January 13, 2010, it was announced that Khabibulin would have surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back. He missed the remainder of the regular season.

Khabibulin kicked off the 2010–11 season with a 37-save performance in a 4–0 victory over the Calgary Flames. However, injuries once again limited his action. He recorded a very poor record of 10–32–3, as the Oilers were once again last place in the Western Conference.

Due to Khabibulin&#x27;s strong play in October of the 2011–12 season, posting a 5–0–2 record, with an NHL-leading .960 save percentage and a 1.12 GAA, he was named the Third Star of the Month. However, Khabibulin&#x27;s play fell off in the second half of the season, and he ended the season with an average 2.65 GAA and a .910 save percentage. In the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, his former backup, Devan Dubnyk, replaced him as the team&#x27;s starting goaltender. This was Khabibulin&#x27;s first season as a backup.

===Return to Chicago (2013–14)===
On July 5, 2013, Khabibulin signed a one-year, $2 million contract to play for the Blackhawks for the 2013–14 season. It was his second stint with Chicago after previously playing for them from 2005 to 2009. He served as the backup goaltender to Corey Crawford.

Khabibulin suffered an injury in a loss to the Nashville Predators on November 16, 2013, and was placed on injured reserve the next day. As a result, goaltender Antti Raanta was recalled from the Blackhawks&#x27; American Hockey league (AHL) affiliate, the Rockford IceHogs. He never played another game in the NHL after sustaining the hip injury. Khabibulin announced his intentions to retire on November 13, 2015. He has expressed an interest in continuing his hockey career in management.

===Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod (2023–2024)===
Khabibulin retired from playing hockey after the 2013–14 NHL season but remained in the sport as goaltender coach for Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). On December 27, 2023, he un-retired and became a goaltender for Torpedo at the age of 50. He did not feature with the club competitively, training with the club for the remainder of the season. 

==International play==



Khabibulin made his international debut with the Soviet Union at the 1991 European Junior Championships. He appeared in the 1992 World Junior Championships the next year and won a gold medal with the CIS, appearing in six games. Khabibulin and the national team had begun the tournament as the Soviet Union, but the state was dissolved following the round robin on New Year&#x27;s Day, thus they proceeded to compete as the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).

That same year, Khabibulin appeared in the 1992 Winter Olympics with the CIS as the third goaltender. He remains the last active player from Russia to win the Olympic Games. Controversy arose after the CIS captured the gold medal when legendary Russian coach Viktor Tikhonov kept a medal for himself (coaches and management are not awarded medals in Olympic hockey) instead of allowing Khabibulin to have one, as Khabibulin had not played a game in the tournament. This is speculated to be the reason for Khabibulin boycotting the Russian team in later international tournaments.

At the 2002 Winter Olympics, in which the 1992 gold medal conflict was resolved, Khabibulin established himself as the national team&#x27;s starting goaltender. He helped Russia to a bronze medal while appearing in all six games, and was named Best Goaltender of the tournament.
Also at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Khabibulin was finally awarded his 1992 Olympic gold medal in a private locker room ceremony with teammates and the Russian Hockey Federation.

After his second season with the Winnipeg Jets of the NHL, Khabibulin competed with Russia in the 1996 World Cup. He appeared in two games.

Khabibulin was called up again in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, but missed the tournament due to injury. Russia&#x27;s starting goaltender was the San Jose Sharks&#x27; Evgeni Nabokov. Khabibulin did not play a game in either tournament, in which Russia failed to win a medal.

==Personal life==
On February 8, 2010, Khabibulin was pulled over in Arizona by a police officer for surpassing the legal speed limit by 25 miles per hour. The officer noted various signs that suggested Khabibulin could have been under the influence of alcohol, and proceeded to administer a field sobriety test. Khabibulin was subsequently arrested and charged with speeding and impaired driving.

On July 7, 2010, Khabibulin&#x27;s court case was postponed. On August 27, 2010, Khabibulin was found guilty of excessive speed, extreme DUI and DUI over the 0.08 level. On August 31, 2010, he received the minimum sentence of 30 days in jail, which he then tried to appeal. On July 26, 2011, Khabibulin withdrew the appeal, and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. He was in a jail for half of the time, and under house arrest for the other half. Khabibulin served his sentence in Joe Arpaio&#x27;s Tent City jail.

Khabibulin helped Victoria Azarenka settle in Scottsdale when she moved from Belarus to pursue a career in tennis. His wife is friends with Azarenka&#x27;s mother and decided to help her. They have become close friends since. Khabibulin&#x27;s daughter, Sasha, is the wife of former NHL player Robert Nilsson.

<text>The Ferriman–Gallwey score is a method of evaluating and quantifying hirsutism in women. The method was originally published in 1961 by D. Ferriman and J.D. Gallwey in the &quot;Journal of Clinical Endocrinology&quot;.
The original method used 11 body areas to assess hair growth, but was decreased to 9 body areas in the modified method:

*Upper lip
*Chin
*Chest
*Upper back
*Lower back
*Upper abdomen
*Lower abdomen
*Upper arms
*Forearms (deleted in the modified method)
*Thighs
*Legs (deleted in the modified method)

In the modified method, hair growth is rated from 0 (no growth of terminal hair) to 4 (extensive hair growth) in each of the nine locations. A patient&#x27;s score may therefore range from a minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 36. With each ethnic group, the amount of hair expected for that ethnicity should be considered. For example, in Caucasian women, a score of 8 or higher is regarded as indicative of androgen excess. 

The method was further modified in 2001 to include a total of 19 locations, with the 10 extra locations being: sideburns, neck, buttocks, inguinal area, area, forearm, leg, foot, toes and fingers. Each area has its own specified definition of the four-point scale.

<doc id="597530" wikidata="Q4739588" url="?curid=597530" title="Amanda Carrington">
<text>Amanda Carrington is a fictional character from the ABC prime time soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro. She was portrayed by Catherine Oxenberg for two seasons from 1984 to 1986, and then by Karen Cellini for 13 episodes from 1986 to 1987. Eliza Bennett plays Amanda in the CW reboot series &quot;Dynasty&quot; from 2021 to 2022.

==Original series==
Amanda was originated by Catherine Oxenberg in the 1984 fifth-season episode &quot;Amanda&quot;. Oxenberg vacated the role in 1986, during the period between the production of seasons six and seven. Purportedly due to a salary dispute, Oxenberg&#x27;s publicist insisted that the actress left &quot;Dynasty&quot; voluntarily, while several media outlets reported that she was fired.

The role was immediately recast with Karen Cellini, who appeared for 13 episodes of the series&#x27; seventh season before the character was written out in the 1987 episode &quot;The Rig&quot;.

Amanda did not appear in the 1991 miniseries continuation &quot;&quot;.

===Storylines===

====Season five====
Close on the heels of Fallon Carrington&#x27;s disappearance and presumed death in a plane crash, a young woman named Amanda Bedford appears in the penthouse of Alexis Colby, Fallon&#x27;s mother, in &quot;Amanda&quot;. Raised primarily by Alexis&#x27; cousin Rosalind Bedford, she is Alexis&#x27; daughter, come to Denver from England to give her mother support after Alexis&#x27; recent arrest and acquittal for the murder of Mark Jennings.

As news of Alexis&#x27; &quot;new&quot; daughter spreads, ex-husband Blake takes a special interest, soon learning that Alexis had been pregnant when he had exiled her from Denver almost two decades earlier. Though Alexis insists that Amanda&#x27;s father is a ski instructor with whom she was involved, it is eventually revealed that she is indeed Blake&#x27;s daughter and that Alexis kept her hidden from him as revenge for being banished years before.

Amanda is attracted to Alexis&#x27; fiancé Dex Dexter, and attempts to seduce him. When they find themselves snowed in together in a remote cabin, they give in to their feelings and make love. Immediately afterwards, Dex regrets his actions and announces that he and Alexis will marry.

Sullen and depressed, Amanda is invited by Blake to a conference in Acapulco, where she meets the handsome Prince Michael of Moldavia. Alexis, who had known Michael&#x27;s father King Galen years ago, encourages the relationship. Amanda learns that Michael is engaged to Elena, a Moldavian duchess, but he assures Amanda that it had been a loveless match. Michael proposes and Amanda, despite her lingering feelings for Dex, accepts.

During their engagement, Amanda is almost kidnapped by Moldavian rebels but rescued by Dex. In the 15 May 1985 season finale &quot;Royal Wedding&quot;, the rebels undertake a large-scale coup, interrupting the wedding in an attempt to kill Galen. Terrorists spray the chapel with gunfire, leaving the entire wedding party seemingly dead or dying on the floor.

====Season six====
Amanda, Michael and the rest of the Carrington family survive the attack, though Luke Fuller—the gay lover of Amanda&#x27;s brother Steven—and family friend Lady Ashley Mitchell are killed. Galen is missing and presumed dead, and rightful heir Michael is forced to leave the country.

Exile, however, puts a strain on Amanda and Michael&#x27;s marriage, as he and Alexis become obsessed with rescuing Galen (who is being held for ransom) and restoring the monarchy. Amanda and Dex are drawn closer as Amanda catches Michael and Elena in a compromising position and Dex catches Alexis with a crown, imagining herself as Queen of Moldavia. Amanda finds a drunken Dex and they make love again—only to be caught in the act by Alexis. Alexis and Dex divorce, as do Amanda and Michael. After Alexis discovers that Galen has in fact been manipulating her, the Moldavian royal family leaves for Lisbon and is never heard from again.

Amanda is devastated when Dex does not want to pursue a relationship with her. She romances Clay Fallmont, but their family rivalry drives him into the arms of Steven&#x27;s ex-wife Sammy Jo. Amanda is involved in a drunk driving incident which is covered up by Blake; estranged from her mother and feeling isolated from her family, Amanda eventually attempts suicide. She survives, and reconciles with a forgiving Alexis. Amanda decides to pursue Clay again. In the 1986 season finale episode &quot;The Choice (a.k.a.) The Vendetta&quot;, Sammy Jo catches Amanda and Clay kissing at the La Mirage hotel; the women fight, winding up in the swimming pool in their party dresses. Meanwhile, Amanda&#x27;s sister-in-law Claudia Carrington accidentally sets the hotel on fire.

====Season seven====
In the seventh season premiere episode &quot;The Victory&quot;, Amanda is trampled in the chaos surrounding the fire but rescued by a mysterious stranger. He turns out to be Michael Culhane, her father&#x27;s former chauffeur who had been fired (and beaten up by Blake&#x27;s thugs) in the first season for having an affair with Fallon. Now grateful to Michael, Blake offers him his job back, but is no happier than before when Michael and Amanda begin dating. Amanda is warned about Michael by sister Fallon, but refuses to leave him. Eventually, an upset and confused Amanda learns that Michael has become wealthy and is using her to get to Blake, and she is last seen in &quot;The Rig&quot; on January 7, 1987. In &quot;The Portrait&quot;, Blake offhandedly explains to Michael that Amanda has returned to England &quot;to think&quot;. The character never appears or is mentioned again during the series.

===Reception===
Oxenberg won two &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards in 1985, for Outstanding Supporting Actress and Outstanding Female Newcomer.

==Reboot==
In August 2021, it was announced that Eliza Bennett would play Amanda in the CW reboot series &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Bennet debuted in the August 2021 episode &quot;The British Are Coming&quot;.

===Storylines===

====Season four====
In the 2021 season four episode &quot;Equal Justice for the Rich&quot;, Alexis Colby (Elaine Hendrix) confesses to Dominique Deveraux (Michael Michele) that she had an affair with a yoga instructor when still married to Blake Carrington (Grant Show) that led to the conception of a child. Alexis went to Europe for six months to give birth in secret, then relinquished the baby girl to a cousin to raise as her own.

Amanda (Eliza Bennett) first visits Atlanta the same season in &quot;The British Are Coming&quot;. She is an intelligent attorney from London in her late 20&#x27;s with an Oxford degree and many questions for Alexis. Her adoptive mother&#x27;s recent death has revealed the truth of her parentage, and she is not shy about having the gaps filled in. Blake senses he is Amanda&#x27;s biological father and proves it with a DNA test. She quickly sets her parents straight, refusing to be used as a pawn in their ongoing feud, but remains in town to establish a new career and get to know her family. Relations with her sister Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies) and brother Adam (Sam Underwood) have a rocky start as neither trusts her. In &quot;A Good Marriage in Every Sense&quot;, Amanda reveals she had a same sex affair with a judge that ended her position at a British law firm. This candor breaks some ice with Fallon, who appreciates her sister&#x27;s smarts and ability to party when off the clock. Adam remains an enemy, but Amanda joins his hospital&#x27;s legal team to keep him in check, then makes bonds with Alexis, Blake, and Cristal (Daniella Alonso). By the end of season four, she has officially changed her surname to Carrington.

====Season five====
Amanda&#x27;s storylines in the final season include proving Alexis&#x27;s innocence against murder charges, getting Adam ousted from the hospital staff, and falling in love with Kirby Anders (Maddison Brown). She does her best to rise above the family&#x27;s constant ploys and maintain a level head to deal with all the drama. By the finale, Amanda has left Atlanta for a prestigious job back in London, but returns to attend the wedding of Michael Culhane (Robert Christopher Riley) and mend her strained relationship with Kirby. 
===Reception===
Jay Snow of &quot;Collider&quot; wrote positively about the addition of Amanda, specifically her sibling rivalry with Adam, bringing out another side to Alexis, and her blossoming romance with Kirby. &quot;As the newest introduction to the Carrington family, Amanda has had a steep learning curve, but we&#x27;ve really learned a lot about her as she&#x27;s worked her way into the family&quot;, Snow writes, adding that, &quot;The writers are doing all of the right things with Amanda (except not letting her interact with Fallon more), and her future is rather bright.

<doc id="597533" wikidata="Q449476" url="?curid=597533" title="David Knopfler">
<text>David Knopfler (born 27 December 1952) is a Scottish musician. Together with his older brother Mark Knopfler, John Illsley, and Pick Withers, he founded the rock band Dire Straits in 1977, serving as rhythm guitarist on their first two albums. After quitting the band in 1980 during the recording of their third album, Knopfler embarked upon a solo career as a recording artist. 

==Early life==
Knopfler was born in Glasgow, to an English mother, Louisa Mary (née Laidler), a teacher, and a Hungarian Jewish father, Erwin Knopfler, an architect. When Knopfler was four, his family moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, where he grew up and later attended Gosforth Grammar School. By the age of 11, Knopfler owned a guitar, a piano and a drum kit, and by 14 he was playing and singing his own compositions in folk clubs. After graduating from Bristol Polytechnic with an honours degree in Economics, Knopfler became a social worker in London.

==Personal life ==

Knopfler is married to art professor Leslie Stroz, who illustrates much of David&#x27;s CD artwork. He lives in Devon, England with his family.

Knopfler was a candidate in the 2023 Teignbridge District Council election for the South Devon Alliance.

== Career ==
=== Dire Straits ===
Knopfler introduced his older brother, guitarist Mark Knopfler, to his bassist flatmate John Illsley. After gaining the interest of drummer Pick Withers, the four founded the rock band Dire Straits. One of Mark&#x27;s friends came up with the band&#x27;s name, which was supposedly a reference to their financial situation at the time the band was beginning to gain notice in the music industry. David however, asserts on his website that &quot;[the] notion that the band were literally in dire straits is largely retrospective myth making and not really factually supportable. We all had day jobs until we got a whacking big advance from Polygram.&quot;

Knopfler played rhythm guitar beside his brother, who was the lead guitarist, lead vocalist and the main composer in the band. David Knopfler appeared on Dire Straits&#x27; first two albums: &quot;Dire Straits&quot; (1978) and &quot;Communiqué&quot; (1979). The stress of composing, arranging songs, recording the then-requisite two albums and tours to support them took its toll on the brothers, and David left the band during the recording of their third album, &quot;Making Movies&quot; (1980), leaving him uncredited on the album.

===Solo===
After leaving Dire Straits, Knopfler released his first solo album in 1983, &quot;Release&quot;. Mark Knopfler and John Illsley both played on the album. Harry Bogdanovs, a lifelong friend of Knopfler, is credited with having co-written three of the tracks and playing synthesiser. The album was supported by the single &quot;Soul Kissing&quot; on the label of Peach River Records. The single peaked at No. 82 in the UK Albums Chart, after Knopfler retrieved the rights from the bankrupt record label.

&quot;Behind the Lines&quot;, his second album, was released in 1985 and his third solo album, &quot;Cut the Wire&quot;, followed in 1986. In 1988, the U.S. label Cypress Records released his fourth album, &quot;Lips Against the Steel&quot;.

Knopfler scored the soundtracks for the films &quot;Shergar&quot; (1984) and &quot;Laser Mission&quot; (1989), and the German productions &quot;Treffer&quot; (1984), &quot;Jakob hinter der blauen Tür&quot; (1989) and &quot;The Great Bellheim&quot;.

&quot;Lifelines&quot; in 1991 released by Phonogram, was recorded in Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios. That album was followed in 1993 by &quot;The Giver&quot;, released by MESA/Bluemoon in the U.S., and Ariola in Europe. Its sparse, acoustic arrangements received positive reviews, as did 1995&#x27;s &quot;Small Mercies&quot;, which Knopfler co-produced with Harry Bogdanovs, featuring Chris White on saxophone. In 2001, Knopfler worked with Bogdanovs again to co-produce the album &quot;Wishbones&quot;, which has guest appearances by Chris Rea and Eddi Reader. His ninth solo album, &quot;Ship of Dreams&quot;, which featured Chris Rea as guest guitarist, was released in 2004.

In May 2005, Knopfler published a book of poetry, &quot;Blood Stones and Rhythmic Beasts&quot;, which was released by the UK&#x27;s BlackWing books ().

The Canadian jazz label Justin Time Records released &quot;Ship of Dreams&quot; in October 2005 with an alternate rendition of &quot;Tears Fall&quot; featuring Megan Slankard (replacing Julia Neigel on the original European release). Knopfler&#x27;s tenth solo album &quot;Songs for the Siren&quot; was released in 2006. Songwriting projects with other artists have included sessions with Amilia Spicer, Mack Starks, Megan Slankard and Wendy Lands.

He played various acoustic and electric gigs in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, Turkey and Australia from 2007 to 2009 with Harry Bogdanovs and his band. The double CD &quot;Acoustic&quot;, containing unplugged renditions of new and old songs, was released in 2011.

Knopfler continued to tour in Spain, Germany, the UK, the United States and Canada in 2012 to 2015. The first-ever limited edition live album, &quot;Made in Germany&quot; (recorded in Erfurt, Germany during the 2012 tour with Bogdanovs), was released in April 2013 exclusively via CDBaby.com.

The album &quot;Last Train Leaving&quot; was released in 2020. &quot;Songs of Loss and Love&quot; was released in December 2020, with &quot;Shooting for the Moon&quot; (2021) and &quot;Skating on the Lake&quot; (2022) following.

<text>DisneyQuest was a chain of indoor interactive theme parks in the United States operated by the Disney Regional Entertainment subsidiary of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.

The DisneyQuest project was designed as a way for the Disney brand to reach populations that may not have the chance to travel to its various theme park destinations. It was meant to target large cities and urban areas. Had the project continued, Disney would have constructed locations in many major cities in the United States, like Philadelphia and Baltimore. However, only two locations were built; one in Walt Disney World and a much shorter-lived one in Chicago.

==History==
DisneyQuest first opened on June 19, 1998, as part of a major expansion of the Downtown Disney entertainment district (today Disney Springs) at Downtown Disney West Side, and was intended as the first of a larger chain of similar facilities.

The first DisneyQuest outside of a resort was opened in Chicago on June 16, 1999, with plans for more locations worldwide. The Chicago location was in a development, North Bridge, where ESPN Zone, a fellow Disney Regional chain, opened about a month later.

On December 9, 1998, Disney Regional announced Philadelphia as a new location as a tenant of the Pavilion at Market East project developed by Goldenberg Group on the former location of a Gimbels Department Store.

The Chicago location permanently closed on September 4, 2001, after 2 years and 3 months of operating due to low visitor numbers as well as other, broader issues. While the location was generating income, it was not enough for Disney.

After the failure of DisneyQuest Chicago, the DisneyQuest project was officially brought to an end. Construction that had begun in Philadelphia was scrapped, leaving a giant hole in its place for several years; the hole has since been filled and the space later became a parking lot. A DisneyQuest at the Disneyland Resort in California never proceeded past the planning stage. After the closure of the Chicago location, Disney Regional Entertainment turned over control of the remaining location to Walt Disney World operations.

On June 30, 2015, Disney officials announced that the Walt Disney World location would close in 2016 as part of the continued redevelopment of Downtown Disney into Disney Springs. A spokesperson for the labor unions that represent Disney employees who work at DisneyQuest stated that displaced workers will be relocated to other positions. The property was set to be redeveloped into a new attraction themed to the NBA after they left their previous location at Universal CityWalk. In November 2016, Disney officials announced that DisneyQuest would remain open for the remainder of the year and into 2017, with no definitive closing date. They further stated that they had no update on the status of the NBA attraction other than it was still planned for the site. On January 30, 2017, the Disney Parks announced that DisneyQuest would close after July 2, 2017, so work on the NBA Experience attraction could begin. DisneyQuest&#x27;s final day of operation was on July 2, 2017, and was demolished a few months later.

Its replacement, the NBA Experience, officially opened on August 12, 2019. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the venue closed in March 2020, and all guest actors were laid off in October the same year. On August 16, 2021, Disney announced that the venue would not reopen. On February 19, 2025, it was reported that Level99, an escape room attraction, would replace the NBA Experience.

All the redemption games were removed from the facility in January 2015 as a cautionary measure, in response to a state law that Disney believed made the games illegal under certain circumstances.

When DisneyQuest closed down on July 2, 2017, the remaining arcade games (including the Fix-It Felix Jr. arcade games from &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;) were removed, and most of them were sold or put into storage.

<doc id="597538" wikidata="Q131109" url="?curid=597538" title="Winteraceae">
<text>Winteraceae is a primitive family of tropical trees and shrubs including 93 species in five genera. It is of particular interest because it is such a primitive angiosperm family, distantly related to Magnoliaceae, though it has a much more southern distribution. Plants in this family grow mostly in the southern hemisphere, and have been found in tropical to temperate climate regions of Malesia, Oceania, eastern Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar and the Neotropics, with most of the genera concentrated in Australasia and Malesia. The five genera, &quot;Takhtajania, Tasmannia, Drimys, Pseudowintera&quot;, and &quot;Zygogynum s.l.&quot; all have distinct geographic extant populations. &quot;Takhtajania&quot; includes a single species, &quot;T. perrieri&quot;, endemic only to Madagascar, &quot;Tasmannia&quot; has the largest distribution of genera in Winteraceae with species across the Philippines, Borneo, New Guinea, Eastern Australia, and Tasmannia, &quot;Drimys&quot; is found in the Neotropical realm, from southern Mexico to the subarctic forests of southern South America, &quot;Pseudowintera&quot; is found only in New Zealand, and &quot;Zygogynum&quot; has species in New Guinea and New Caledonia.

This family has been estimated to be anywhere from 105 to at least 35 million years ago. Being one of few angiosperms forming persistent tetrads with prominent sculpturing, pollen of Winteraceae is rare but easy to identify in the fossil record. Pollen samples found in Gabon may indicate that the family is at least 120 million years old, but the association of these fossils with Winteraceae is uncertain. Oldest unambiguous Winteraceae fossils are from the middle to late Albian of Israel (~110 million years old; described as &quot;Qatanipollis&quot;). Pollen fossils indicate that the range has been much wider than it is now, reaching north as far as Greenland during the Paleocene (Danian), and disappearing from continental Africa (Cape Peninsula, South Africa) in the Miocene. Equally characteristic is Winteraceae wood, which lacks xylem vessels in contrast to most other flowering plants. Fossil Winteraceae wood has been found in the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene (c. 85–35 million years ago) of Antarctica (Santonian-Campanian), western North America (Central Valley, California; Maastrichian) and Europe (Helmstedt, Germany; Eocene).

According to the 1998 APG I system, it did not belong to any order, but it has since been placed in Canellales by the APG II, APG III and APG IV systems.

==Description==
Members of the family Winteraceae are trees or shrubs. The leaves are alternate, with light green dots and a fragrant aroma. Some are used to produce essential oils. Stipules are absent. Flowers are small, mostly appearing in cymes or fascicles. They have two to six free, valvate sepals, though they are united in &quot;Drimys&quot;.

The Winteraceae have no vessels in their xylem. This makes them relatively immune to xylem embolisms caused by freezing temperatures. In addition, vascular occlusion can occur near the openings of the stomata, preventing excess water from entering.

Among all species, the distinctive characters of released pollen tetrads are easily recognized using light and electron microscopy.

== Evolution of vesselless wood ==
Winteraceae was initially placed as a basal group within the Angiosperms due to its vesselless wood. Xylem vessels were seen as an important evolved character for the diversification and success of Angiosperms, so vesselless wood was seen as an archaic trait, resulting in basal placement of the Winteraceae. However, molecular phylogenetic work placed Winteraceae within the Magnoliids, well within the angiosperms. This placement suggests that the vesselless wood of the Winteraceae was a derived character rather than ancestral. Through the fossil pollen record, it is hypothesized that Winteraceae moved from Northern Gondwana through Southern Gondwana in the Cretaceous. This meant movement from hot humid environments to temperate humid environments where freeze-thaw events occurred. Vesselless wood has 20% of the water conductivity of vessel-bearing wood, however, under freeze events, wood with vessels loses up to 85% of water conductivity while vesselless wood loses at most 6% of water conductivity. The ability to avoid serious water limitation and therefore the shedding of leaves is hypothesized to be a major evolutionary pressure behind the reversion to vesselless wood. This is further supported by the heteroxylly hypothesis in which “primitive” vessels conferred little difference in stem hydraulic efficiency under normal conditions as compared to vesselless angiosperms. This would indicate that the pressure of freeze-thaw events and the subsequent risk of embolism would be a stronger evolutionary factor compared to the weaker hydraulic constraints of vesselless wood compared to “primitive” vessels. This movement from hot humid environments to temperature humid environments where freeze-thaw events occurred is seen as the evolutionary pressure behind the unique reversion to vesselless wood in Winteraceae.

Another character of Winteraceae that was seen to indicate a basal position in the phylogeny was the presence of waxy stomatal plugs, seen as limiting water loss in respiration and therefore an archaic trait to limit water loss. However, further research showed that in these humid environments, water cover on the surface of leaves decreased photosynthetic rates and waxy stomatal plugs reduce this water cover and therefore reduce the negative impacts on photosynthetic ability. Winteraceae species with stomatal plugs removed saw decreases in photosynethic rates of up to 40%. This further shows that characters once thought to be archaic could rather be derived adaptations to temperate humid environments.

== Rediscovery of &quot;Takhtajania&quot; ==
&quot;Takhtajania perrieri&quot; was first collected 1909 on the Manongarivo Massif of central Madagascar at an elevation of 1700 meters. In 1963, the French botanist René Paul Raymond Capuron examined the unidentified plant sample, which he identified as a new species, which he named &quot;Bubbia perrieri&quot;, after the French botanist Henri Perrier de la Bâthie, classifying it in the Australasian genus &quot;Bubbia&quot;. In 1978, the botanists Baranova and J. F. Leroy reclassified the plant into its own genus, &quot;Takhtajania&quot;, after the Russian botanist Armen Takhtajan. Many subsequent expeditions to find the species were futile, but in 1994 Malagasy plant collector Fanja Rasoavimbahoaka collected a specimen in Anjahanaribe-Sud Special Reserve 150 km from the location at which the 1909 specimen was collected, which George E. Schatz identified in May 1997 as &quot;Takhtajania&quot;. A subsequent expedition discovered a large grove of the species at the spot where the second sample was collected.

== Notable species ==
&quot;Drimys winteri&quot; (Winter&#x27;s bark) is a slender tree native to the Magellanic and Valdivian temperate forests of Chile and Argentina. It is a common garden plant grown for its fragrant mahogany-red bark, bright-green leaves, and its clusters of creamy white, jasmine-scented flowers. The bark has historically been used to prevent scurvy.

&quot;Tasmannia piperita&quot; is notable for the great range of numbers for petal, stamen and pistil counts. &quot;Tasmannia lanceolata&quot;, known as Tasmanian pepper, is grown as an ornamental shrub, and is increasingly being used as a condiment.

<doc id="597542" wikidata="Q1346135" url="?curid=597542" title="University of Akron">
<text>The University of Akron is a public research university in Akron, Ohio, United States. It is part of the University System of Ohio. As a STEM-focused institution, it focuses on industries such as polymers, advanced materials, and engineering. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

The University of Akron offers about 200 undergraduate and more than 100 graduate majors and has an enrollment of approximately 15,000 students. The university&#x27;s School of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering is housed in a 12-story reflective glass building near downtown Akron on the western edge of the main campus. UA&#x27;s Archives of the History of American Psychology is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution.

The university has three branch campuses: Wayne College in Orrville, Ohio; the Medina County University Center, in Lafayette Township, Ohio; and UA Lakewood, in the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood, Ohio. In addition, the university hosts nursing programs in affiliation with Lorain County Community College.

==History==
===Buchtel College===
In 1867, at the annual convention of the Universalist Church of the state of Ohio, the Committee on Education expressed an interest in founding a college compatible with Universalist religious principles. It was announced that the location would be given to those who could find an appropriate location and also supply $60,000 for the college. John R. Buchtel, a prominent Akron businessman and Universalist, promptly contributed $25,000 to the endowment fund and $6,000 to the building fund. This led other Akronites to donate, setting the goal and securing Akron as the location for Buchtel College, named after its greatest supporter. John R. Buchtel continued to be the college&#x27;s most significant contributor, giving $500,000 over his lifetime, approximately equivalent to $16 million today. When the university opened in 1872 it was a single-building campus, housed in what is now known as &quot;Old Buchtel.&quot; George Washington Crouse donated $10,000 of the $20,000 needed to build a new gymnasium, completed in 1888. It was named Crouse Gymnasium in his honor, and was known as &quot;the finest gym west of the Alleghenies.&quot;

Tragedy struck the small college on December 20, 1899, when Old Buchtel burned to the ground. Insurance only covered $65,000 of the estimated $100,000 in loss. While new campus buildings were being constructed, the Crouse Gymnasium was divided into seven classrooms and served as the college until a new Buchtel Hall was opened in 1901. The new Buchtel Hall, which itself was gutted by fire in 1971, survives to this day but had some blackening on the exterior up until a 2011 restoration.

===20th century===
In 1907, the college shed its Universalist affiliation and became a non-denominational institution, in order to be able to receive funds from the Carnegie Foundation, which would not give funds to religiously affiliated schools. In 1913, Buchtel College trustees transferred the institution and its assets to the city of Akron, and Buchtel College became the Municipal University of Akron. At this time, the enrollment was 198 students. Tax money levied for the school and Akron&#x27;s growing population led to strong growth for the university. Over the next several decades the university continued to add new buildings to accommodate its growing student population, acquiring more land through purchases and donations. In 1963, Governor Jim Rhodes approved the university as a state-assisted institution. Enrollment in 1964 was 10,000 students. In 1967, it fully became a state university, providing its current name as The University of Akron. In 2015, 25,117 students were enrolled at the University of Akron.

===Construction, dropping enrollment, and lay-offs===

During the tenure (1999-2014) of its 15th president, Luis M. Proenza, the University of Akron underwent a $627 million construction project, called &quot;A New Landscape for Learning.&quot; A new football stadium, InfoCision Stadium-Summa Field, was also constructed on campus. The new stadium opened for its first game on September 12, 2009. The stadium replaced the Rubber Bowl, which is from campus and was built in 1940.

The university purchased the Quaker Square Crowne Plaza Hotel and shopping complex and uses it as a residence hall space. The university did a land-swap with the city of Akron so that the city may find a new downtown hotel. This means the University of Akron campus is made up of 82 buildings on near downtown Akron with a total property value of $1.84 billion.

In 2015, the university eliminated over 200 positions as the result of a $6 million budget deficit. Subsequently, in May 2016, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service, downrated the university&#x27;s bonds from stable to negative, because of low enrollment and high debts and pension burdens. Moody&#x27;s upgraded the university&#x27;s outlook to stable in 2018, citing improved enrollment, rising donations and steps to reduce expenses. Still, between 2011 and 2020 the university&#x27;s enrollment went down almost 40 percent, from 25,190 in 2011 to 15,385 in 2020.

On October 1, 2019, Gary Miller became Akron&#x27;s 18th president; formerly the chancellor of University of Wisconsin–Green Bay, he was given a five-year contract with a base salary of $475,000, with an annual $25,000 in a deferred compensation plan, monthly stipends of $3,500 and $750 for housing and a car, and $36,000 for moving expenses. In May 2020, president Miller announced that the university will consolidate its eleven academic colleges into five due to budget issues resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; the cut is meant to reduce administrative costs, and &quot;the plan does not cut or change any degree program offerings.&quot; The &quot;redesign&quot;, as Miller called it, was termed a &quot;bloodbath&quot; by the faculty union president, and would eliminate &quot;97 full-time professors out of about 570&quot;; the union commented that &quot;names were selected regardless of rank or tenure status&quot;. One study suggested that &quot;women and professors of color were laid off at a disproportionate rate&quot;. After earlier layoffs and faculty taking early retirement, that added up to a loss of almost a quarter of the university&#x27;s faculty since the start of the pandemic.

The university&#x27;s chapter of the American Association of University Professors had advocated the university also consider cuts to athletics and leave NCAA Division I, which had lost $215 million during that decade, but the university said it would cut only $4.4 million from athletics. The &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; reported in August 2022 that thirty-six of the professors who had been fired were hired back by the university, but as adjuncts, with a similar workload and lower pay--in one case, at $18,000 a year, one-third of their former salary. In 2021, the Board of Trustees extended President Miller&#x27;s contract, praising him for &quot;consistent and decisive leadership&quot;. They increased the annual deferred compensation to $40,000, promised additional bonuses for 2025-2027 for a total of $107,000 if he remained on the job, and increased his housing and car stipends to $4,000 and $1,000, respectively.

===Relationship with tire and rubber industry===
The tire and rubber industry and the University of Akron have an overlapping history. Historically, several rubber corporations, such as Goodyear, Firestone, General Tire and Rubber Company, and Goodrich, had their headquarters in Akron. In 1909, the world&#x27;s first courses in rubber chemistry were offered at the university. The university is also credited with featuring the first College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering in the world, which was founded in 1988.

==Academics==
The University of Akron offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees, ranging from certificate to doctoral programs. Bierce Library is the main campus library, named for Lucius Bierce, an American Civil War-era General whose personal library constituted the first collection of the University Libraries.

The University of Akron comprises the following colleges, schools, and campuses:
*Buchtel College of Arts and Sciences
*College of Business
*College of Engineering and Polymer Science
*College of Health and Human Sciences
*The Graduate School
*School of Law
*Williams Honors College
*Wayne College

The university offers about 200 undergraduate majors. In conjunction with the Northeast Ohio Medical University (NEOMED), the university offers an Early Assurance Pathway to the NEOMED MD program. The University of Akron is also the first and only university in the nation to offer a baccalaureate program in corrosion engineering.

The University of Akron Honors College students earn degrees from any of the four-year accredited colleges in the university while receiving special advisement and having the opportunity to live in the Honors Complex, a resident hall exclusively for honors students. The university announced on February 3, 2016, that the college was renamed in honor of Dr. Gary B. and Pamela S. Williams.

The University of Akron currently offers more than 105 graduate degrees to approximately 2,000 graduate students. The graduate schools at the University of Akron variously offer the Master&#x27;s degree, PhD, J.D., and LL.M., among others. The Cleveland Clinic and University of Akron have formed the Integrated Bioscience Fellowship in Biomedicine. Fellowships will allow students to conduct cutting-edge research at the University of Akron and the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute while pursuing a PhD in Integrated Bioscience. Recipients of Fellowships will be able to work with faculty at both institutions.
