<text>Carl Frederick Kendall Palmer (born 20 March 1950) is an English drummer. He was a founding member of the supergroups Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, and Asia, a touring drummer for The Crazy World of Arthur Brown and a founding member of Atomic Rooster. He has toured with his own bands since 2001, including Palmer, the Carl Palmer Band, and currently, Carl Palmer&#x27;s ELP Legacy.

Palmer was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1989, and was awarded the Prog God Award at the 2017 Progressive Music Awards.

== Career ==
===Early groups, Arthur Brown, and Atomic Rooster===
Palmer began taking drum lessons as a young boy. He took lessons with Britain&#x27;s best-known classical percussionist of the twentieth century, James Blades. His first band, formed with others from the Midlands area, was originally known as the King Bees, but changed its name to the Craig. In 1966, the band made its first record, &quot;I Must Be Mad&quot;, with flip side &quot;Suspense&quot;, produced by Larry Page. At this time, Palmer also did his first session work, playing on the song &quot;Love Light&quot; by the Chants, a group from Liverpool. Later in 1966, he was then invited to join Chris Farlowe and the Thunderbirds.

Drachen Theaker was the original drummer for The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, founded by Arthur Brown. Theaker abruptly left the band during a U.S. tour in 1969. Palmer was quickly recruited as a replacement and became a permanent band member.

Vincent Crane was the keyboard player with the Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and both he and Palmer left that group in the summer of 1969 to strike out musically on their own as Atomic Rooster, a trio formed with vocalist/bassist Nick Graham. Palmer reports that Brown himself had &quot;gone missing on a commune on Long Island&quot; and that this was a deciding factor in forming the new band. There were several personnel changes in the band, and their first album was released in early 1970. Meanwhile, Palmer received a call from Keith Emerson to audition for a new group and left Atomic Rooster in the summer of 1970.

===Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer===

Palmer met up with two other young English musicians, Greg Lake and Keith Emerson. Emerson had most recently been a member of The Nice, and Lake was in King Crimson, and both wanted to further expand their musical creativity. After discussions with Jimi Hendrix and Mitch Mitchell about forming a group fell apart, they auditioned several drummers, and felt an &quot;immediate chemistry&quot; with Palmer, and by the summer of 1970 they had formed a band. In naming the new group, the trio chose their last names alphabetically – Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, also shortened to ELP. The band has been the most successful of his career, and he remained with ELP until they first disbanded in 1979. The band was nominated at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards for Best New Artist, making them the first progressive rock group to achieve this feat. They developed a sound that merged art rock, jazz, electronica, pop rock and classical music and found fans within their peers and the public alike.

Palmer rejoined the newly reformed ELP in 1992 for &quot;Black Moon&quot;, &quot;In the Hot Seat&quot;, a box set, as well as several DVDs and the subsequent tours. In 1998, the trio split. A one-off ELP performance at the 2010 High Voltage Festival celebrated the 40th anniversary of forming the band. Following the deaths of Emerson and Lake in 2016, Palmer is the only surviving member of ELP.

===Asia===
Following the first break-up of ELP in 1980, Palmer formed PM with Texas blues rock guitarist John Nitzinger for one album before joining John Wetton and Steve Howe in early 1981, who had been brought together to form a new super-group. They were later joined by Geoff Downes to form Asia. The group was nominated at the 25th Annual Grammy Awards for Best New Artist, making them the second and last progressive rock band to achieve this feat. Palmer became only the second artist to be nominated twice for this award, after David Crosby. Palmer left Asia in 1991 to join the ELP reunion. After several personnel changes the four founding members of Asia including Palmer reunited in 2006.

Palmer has been reunited with the original line-up of Asia since 2006. They celebrated their 25th anniversary, and have since released four new studio albums, &quot;Phoenix&quot;, in 2008, &quot;Omega&quot; in 2010, XXX (30) in 2012, and &quot;Gravitas&quot; in 2014. A live album and DVD from the 2006 reunion tour, entitled &quot;Fantasia&quot; was released by Eagle Rock Records.

===Production credits===
The jazz trio Back Door toured with ELP circa 1974, and Palmer began to collaborate with them, producing their fourth album, &quot;Activate&quot; (1976). Two of the members of the group, saxophonist Ron Aspery and bassist Colin Hodgkinson, co-wrote the song &quot;Bullfrog&quot; with Palmer, also playing (uncredited) on the song, which appears on &quot;Works Volume 2&quot;.

===Other projects===

Palmer played drums on &quot;Mount Teidi&quot; on &quot;Five Miles Out&quot; (1982) by Mike Oldfield. Another Oldfield track he performed on, &quot;Ready Mix&quot;, remained unreleased until 2001.

Palmer has performed various drum clinics across Europe and the United States. Highlights of Palmer&#x27;s live drum solo over the years have included the use of both gongs and tambourines, and also his ability to extract himself from his T-shirt while playing complex double bass drum patterns; the latter leaving him stripped to the waist to play the final part of his show. The removal of his shirt was a major &#x27;attraction&#x27; in Palmer&#x27;s drum solos during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. On recent tours, however, his shirt has remained on throughout his performances.

Palmer is a patron of the British Classic Rock Society, which promotes progressive rock concerts.

In 2001, Palmer formed his own band, initially known as Palmer and then the Carl Palmer Band, featuring guitarist Shaun Baxter and bassist Dave Marks. They were replaced by Paul Bielatowicz and Stuart Clayton, and later by Simon Fitzpatrick, performing instrumental versions of ELP songs as Carl Palmer&#x27;s ELP Legacy. In 2017, following Emerson and Lake&#x27;s deaths, the trio embarked on the Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer Lives On! World Tour.

In November 2019, Palmer held the Carl Palmer&#x27;s Prog Rock Camp at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia.

In 2019, Palmer performed with Asia and ELP Legacy during The Royal Affair Tour, headlined by Yes.

In 2021, Palmer returned to performing following the COVID pandemic to promote the Carl Palmer&#x27;s ELP Legacy Tour celebrating ELP&#x27;s 50th anniversary. In addition to Palmer, the band features Paul Bielatowicz on guitar and vocals; and Simon Fitzpatrick on bass and Chapman stick.

==Influences==
Having played with a variety of bands, including various anonymous schoolboy bands as a youth, Palmer&#x27;s style was developed from a wide range of musical influences. Among Palmer&#x27;s early drumming influences were Joe Morello, Philly Joe Jones, Art Blakey, Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. Inspiration from their techniques can be heard in his own drumming style, which was initially influenced more from jazz than any other genre. Known for his technical prowess, another of Palmer&#x27;s trademarks included solos in many of his performances. His later work in Asia saw a more basic approach, although he began to play double bass drums more frequently during that period, and was the eleventh drummer to be inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Carl married his first wife, Maureen Fraser, in 1985. She gave birth to his only child, Carissa, now a lawyer. His spouse since 2004 has been Katie, with whom Palmer resides in both Cyprus and the UK. He became vegan in 2010.

==Equipment==
===Drums===
*Palmer owns a Ludwig Vistalite drum kit with blue Vistalite shells.
*Ludwig signature &quot;Venus&quot; snare drum.

In 2011, Ludwig released his &quot;Signature Venus snare drum&quot;, made of a green-lacquered brass shell with a 3.7&quot; depth and a 14&quot; diameter.

*Stainless steel drum kit

In 1973, Palmer commissioned British Steel to design a custom stainless steel drum kit using one-half-inch thick shells; the only off-the-shelf equipment were the hoops manufactured by Gretsch. He also had a jeweller engrave the shells with various animals. The kit, along with other percussion instruments and a rotating platform, had a total weight of approximately 2.5 tons and many of the stages on tour had to be reinforced, with some venues cancelling shows because of it. Also, the kit was electronically designed to be &quot;synthesized&quot; to sound like electronic drums. The kit was purchased around 1980 by Ringo Starr for his son Zak, who rarely used it. Ringo put it up for auction in 2015, and it was purchased by David Frangioni, publisher and CEO of &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine.

*Paiste Bronze drum kit; Palmer also used a bronze drum kit manufactured by Paiste, which is built from 2002 model cymbal bronze.
*Korg WaveDrum; Palmer uses a Korg Wavedrum in his drum solo.

===Cymbals===
Palmer has endorsed Paiste since 1971 and currently uses this cymbal setup :
* 5&quot; 2002 Cup Chime
* 13&quot; Signature Heavy Hi-Hat
* 6&quot; 2002 Cup Chime
* 18&quot; Signature Power Crash
* 20&quot; Signature Heavy Bell Ride
* 20&quot; Signature Power Crash
* 13&quot; 2002 Sound Edge Hi-Hat
* 6&quot; 2002 Bell Chime
* 22&quot; 2002 China

===Heads===
Palmer uses Remo drumheads.

===Sticks===
Pro-Mark produced his first signature drumsticks. They were made of American hickory, with a quite short length (15 7/8&quot;) and a diameter between a 5A and a 5B (0.579&quot;). After leaving Pro-Mark, he joined Vater Percussion drumsticks in 2022, who made him a brand new signature stick. The new signature sticks, while still made of American hickory and still having a diameter between a 5A and a 5B (0.580&quot;), brings the length back up to a standard length (16&quot;).

===Other===
Palmer also uses timpani, tubular bells and tam-tam as usually used in the symphony orchestra. Other percussion he has used include temple blocks, triangle, church bell, vibraslap, electronic percussion synthesizers and ratchet.

<doc id="608906" wikidata="Q2096201" url="?curid=608906" title="Seven-string guitar">
<text>The seven-string guitar adds one additional string to the more common six-string guitar, commonly used to extend the bass range (usually a low B) or also to extend the treble range.

The additional string is added in one of two different ways: by increasing the width of the fingerboard such that the additional string may be fretted by the left hand; or, by leaving the fingerboard unchanged and adding a &quot;floating&quot; bass string. In the latter case, the extra bass string lies next to the existing bass strings, but free of the fingerboard in similar fashion as the archlute and theorbo. Such unfrettable bass strings were historically known as diapasons or bourdons.

Some types of seven-string guitars are specific to certain cultures such as the Russian, Mexican, and Brazilian guitars.

==History==
The history of the seven-string guitar stretches back more than 230 years. During the Renaissance period (), the European guitar generally had four courses, each strung with two gut strings, and the pair of strings within each course tuned in unison. By the mid-Baroque period (), it more commonly had five courses (still double-strung) and used a variety of tunings, some of them re-entrant. By the early 18th century, six double-strung courses had become common.

Up to this point, most stringed instruments were strung with gut strings. At around 1800, quality metal-wire strings became widely available. These new strings were more durable, remained in tune longer and, most importantly, produced a louder sound than the traditional gut strings. As use of metal strings became more widely adopted, their greater volume output impelled luthiers to experiment more with single-strung courses on their instruments and, in a relatively short time, the modern practice of using six single strings became first common, and then standard.
The changing number of courses in these early guitars may also illustrate an ongoing desire on behalf of players to increase the range of the instrument, a development similar to that gone through by the lute in earlier days. It is likely that all of these factors contributed to the development of the seven-string guitar, which has been around ever since. The seven-string guitar never became as widely accepted in Europe as the six-string instrument, but a number of composers did produce a significant body of work for the seven string. French guitarist Napoleon Coste (1805–1883) composed works with a seven-string guitar specifically in mind. The Italian guitarist Mario Maccaferri (1899–1993) was a celebrated advocate of bass strings (diapasons or bourdons) and also composed for the instrument.

By contrast, in Russia the seven-string guitar became widely popular, and entire schools of playing were developed around its use. Despite some brief setbacks in the mid-20th century, during which six-string instruments rose in prominence, the seven-string Russian guitar has remained popular in Russia to this day.

In the New World, a or —with fourteen strings, strung in seven double courses—has been known in Mexico since at least 1776 (Antonio Vargas). These instruments may still be found in use in Mexico, although the modern six-string instrument has become far more common. Seven-string instruments retain current popularity in parts of South America, notably Brazil, where they became an important instrument in the &quot;choro&quot; [es] music of the 19th century, which is currently experiencing a revival.

==Acoustic designs==

===Russian ===
The Russian guitar or gypsy guitar is a seven-string acoustic guitar tuned to the open G tuning (DGBDGBD), which arrived or was developed early in the 19th century in Russia, possibly as a development of the cittern, the kobza and the torban. It is known in Russia as the semistrunnaya gitara () or affectionately as the semistrunka ().

Its invention was popularized by Andrei Sychra, who also wrote a method for the guitar, as well as over one thousand compositions, seventy-five of which were republished in the 1840s by Stellovsky, and then again in the 1880s by Gutheil. Some of these were published again in the Soviet Union in 1926. Andrei Sychra in his notation, marks with a number between 1 and 4 where to fret the 7th string with the thumb. Another way that Andrei Sychra took advantage of this guitar&#x27;s innovation was through natural harmonics. Because of the three strings tuned to D, harmonics could be played in synchronization.

Early instruments used gut, and later silk strings; rarely wire. In the 20th century these instruments commonly used nylon strings, like western classical guitars, though by the last third of the century both nylon-strung &quot;classical&quot; and metal-strung &quot;gypsy&quot; versions of the instrument were both plentiful. Whatever material was used for stringing, the Russian guitar is traditionally played without a pick, using fingers for either strumming or picking. The origins of the 7 string most likely came from the English &quot;guittar&quot; popular in the late 18th century. The added string created an extra dimension for bass notes as well as opening up chord possibilities. The seventh string is also likely to have been influenced by the harp as it is meant to played arpeggiated. It also happens that the open D tuning was a perfect fourth lower than the six string tuning. The open D string tuning of this guitar was convenient for many Russian folk songs and dances that were typically within the major key. Along with the added interval possibilities came new techniques not previously seen with 6th string guitars.

The Russian version of the seven-string guitar has been used by professionals, because of its great flexibility and its sound, but has also been popular with amateurs for accompaniment (especially Russian bards) due to the relative simplicity of some basic chords and the ease of playing alternating bass lines. While greatly popular in Russia and Ukraine, this type of guitar has only recently been generating some interest outside of its traditional homeland.

The earliest music published for a seven-string guitar was in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 15 December 1798. The school was owned by Ignác František Held (1766, Třebechovice pod Orebem, Bohemia – 1816, Brest-Litovsk, Russia).

Standard tuning for the Russian guitar is: D2 G2 B2 D3 G3 B3 D4
with a very common &quot;classical&quot; variant being C2 G2 B2 D3 G3 B3 D4

Other tunings include:
* G-C-E-G-C-E-G (&quot;Big guitar&quot;) (Open C)
* F-B-D-F-B-D-F (1/3rd guitar) (Open Bb)
* E-A-B-D-G-B-D
* E-G-B-D-G-B-D
* D-G-C-D-G-B-D
* B-F-B-E-A-D-F
* A-E-A-D-G-B-E
* A-D-G-C-F-A-D

===Brazilian ===

The Brazilian seven-string guitar () is an acoustic guitar used primarily in choro and samba. It was introduced to Brazil in the late 19th century as a steel string guitar. The style of &quot;baixaria&quot; counterpoint and accompaniment technique was developed throughout the 20th century, especially by Dino 7 Cordas and Raphael Rabello. In the early 1980s, guitarist Luiz Otavio Braga had a nylon string version made, and this has become the norm for most contemporary solo musicians such as Yamandu Costa.

The Brazilian seven-string guitar is typically tuned like a classical guitar, but with an additional C below the low E as follows: C2 E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4; although some musicians tune the C down to a B resulting in: B1 E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4.

===Classical ===
Seven-string guitarists are utilized in playing traditional and contemporary &quot;classical&quot; repertoire. These instruments are essentially nylon-strung classical guitars with one extra (usually) bass string, and the tuning is most commonly: B1 E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4. Aficionados of the instrument have produced many new arrangements, traditionally six-string classical guitar pieces, and the seventh string may be retuned—to C or D, for example—to accommodate these arrangements. The use of this instrument in the classical world, along with other extended range instruments having 8, 9, 10, 11, or more strings, has become common enough that several noted string manufacturers now produce and mark string sets specifically for seven-string classical guitars (La Bella; Pyramid; d&#x27;Aquisto; etc.). For example, Napoleon Coste arranged one of Franz Schubert&#x27;s pieces for guitar and vocal accompaniment, despite guitars being typically for solo performance at the time.

===Mexican ()===
There is a guitar of seven pairs of strings, totaling 14 strings, known as aka 14 String Guitar. The instrument is still played in Mexico and the USA by popular bands, most notably Korn.

==Electric designs==
===Semi-hollow and hollow body electric guitars===
In the United States, the jazz guitarist George Van Eps had a seven-string guitar built for him by Epiphone Guitars in the late 1930s and a signature Gretsch seven-string in the late 60s and early 70s. The Van Eps signature guitar may be the first regular-production seven-string electric guitar. Van Eps tuned his 7th string to A.

Several others began using seven-string guitars after Van Eps, including Bucky Pizzarelli, Howard Alden, Ron Escheté, Chance Russell, and John Pizzarelli, son of Bucky Pizzarelli. Lenny Breau also used seven string instruments, but whereas the other players all used instruments with an added bass string, Breau had at least one instrument in which the seventh string was an added &quot;treble&quot; string, tuned to the &#x27;A&#x27; above the high &#x27;E&#x27; string (A4). At the time he began using the high A string, no commercially manufactured string could withstand being tuned that high, so Breau substituted a piece of monofilament fishing line of appropriate gauge. A year later, advances in materials science allowed the La Bella company to begin manufacturing a custom string for Breau&#x27;s high A.

Seven-string semi-acoustic archtop guitars were used by jazz-guitarist Ralph Patt after he began exploring major-thirds tuning in 1964. Patt&#x27;s tuning is a regular tuning, in the sense that all of the intervals between its successive open strings are major thirds; in contrast, the standard guitar-tuning has one major-third amid four fourths. Major-thirds tuning has a smaller scope than standard guitar-tuning, and so Patt started using seven-string guitars, which enabled major-thirds tuning to have the E-e&#x27; range of the standard tuning. He first experimented with a wide-neck Mango guitar from the 1920s, which he modified to have seven strings in 1963. In 1967 he purchased a seven-string by José Rubio.

The first seven-string electric guitars were built in the &quot;hollowbody&quot; or &quot;semi-hollow&quot; archtop styles, where the guitar has a central resonating chamber, or a central block with resonant chambers on the sides. This gave the guitar the dark woodiness, breath, and richness that is associated with traditional &quot;jazz&quot; tone, but also made prone to feedback at high volumes, making it problematic for rock guitar playing.

===Solid body electric guitars===

In the early thirties the National String Instrument Corporation offered seven-string versions of their solid-body lap-steel guitars.

A solid body seven-string electric guitar was conceived by guitarist Lenny Breau and built by luthier Kirk Sand, debuting at the 1983 NAMM Show, featuring a high A-string (rather than the low A-string of Eps). In 1987, Fender signed an agreement with Alex Gregory to produce a Stratocaster-style guitar that featured a high A-string. A small number of prototypes were made. However the unit was never put into production. He has made numerous false claims in regards to the 7 string guitar and is not considered a reliable source of information, even regarding his own 7 string signature series which was produced in limited numbers by Fender. He frequently embellishes the events that took place in all facets of its production. 

The first mass-produced seven-string was the Ibanez UV7, a signature model for Steve Vai. It was also used by John Petrucci, Reb Beach, and Korn guitarists Brian Welch and James Shaffer, amongst others. Vai was drawn to the idea for much of the same reasons seven-string classical and jazz players were—the extended range the additional string offered. After initial experimentation with a high A, a low B was added as the high A proved to be too prone to breaking. (Kirk Sand and Lenny Breau solved the breaking high A string problem by shortening the scale length to 22.75&quot;, Vai&#x27;s Ibanez is 25.5&quot;.) Vai began touring with Whitesnake with a seven-string prototype, and then used the guitars for his 1990 release &quot;Passion and Warfare&quot;.

The seven-string guitar became prominent when the band Korn featured Ibanez Universe guitars on their 1994 debut album. During the 1990s, manufacturers of 7-strings included Fender&#x27;s subsidiary Squier and Gibson&#x27;s subsidiary Epiphone.

In this time many guitarists were introduced to the extended range offered by a seven-string guitar. This was somewhat offset by a growing stigma that a seven-string guitar was a &quot;nu metal&quot; instrument, fit only for heavy riffing. This was ironic as Korn guitarists Munky and Head remember being told in their early days that the seven-string guitar could not be used for riffing, as it was a guitar for technical guitar players.

In the 1990s, several other heavy metal guitarists began using seven-string instruments (notably John Petrucci, Trey Azagthoth, and Erik Rutan), seeing the possibility for detuned riffing while preserving the full upper range of the guitar for solos. However, the seven-string guitar failed to really catch on at this phase in its development, and the Universe model was discontinued briefly in 1995. Historically, Matt Bellamy from Muse had used a custom red Manson seven-string to play just one song, &quot;Citizen Erased&quot;, with a AADDGBE tuning (the song was originally recorded on a detuned six-string). However, he later started using new Manson custom seven-strings to play new songs &quot;Supremacy&quot;, &quot;Survival&quot; and &quot;Liquid State&quot; on Muse&#x27;s 2012 &quot;The 2nd Law&quot; album tour. Dino Cazares uses custom seven-string Ibanez guitars; Christian Olde Wolbers has his own signature Jackson seven-string guitar, Jeff Loomis has a signature model made by Schecter and Stephen Carpenter has several of his own models released by ESP.

== Hybrid designs ==
In the early 2000s, Roger McGuinn (renowned for his skills on the twelve-string guitar and for his long association with The Byrds) worked with C. F. Martin &amp; Company to develop a seven-string folk guitar. McGuinn&#x27;s guitar (currently being marketed by Martin) is tuned the same as a standard folk guitar with steel strings, but the third (G) string is augmented with a high octave string. Many of McGuinn&#x27;s notable guitar solos utilize the G string of the twelve-string guitar to perform the main melody, and therefore the Martin seven-string guitar was designed to achieve this extended range playing without the need for doubling all six of the guitar&#x27;s strings.

In 2010, Inox Guitars has created a mix of the Brazilian Viola caipira and the Russian semistrunka (семиструнка). This instrument has 2 bass strings (as the 6th and 7th strings of the semistrunka) and five treble courses (as the Viola caipira) and it is used in open tuning (GDGDGBD) as a slide guitar.

==Tuning==

The 7-string guitar of today is frequently tuned with a lower B on the added seventh string (B1–E2–A2–D3–G3–B3–E4). Modern metal bands such as Trivium (on &quot;The Crusade&quot; and &quot;Shogun&quot;), Dream Theater and Haken commonly use this tuning. 

Many jazz musicians tune in dropped A tuning (A1–E2–A2–D3–G3–B3–E4) for improved bass lines and easier power chords. Choro players usually tune the seventh string up a half-step, to C: C2-E2-A2-D3-G3-B3-E4. The common Russian guitar tunings given above are still in widespread use. And players who prefer an added &quot;treble&quot; string (instead of an added bass string) usually tune: E2–A2–D3–G3–B3–E4–A4.

==Uses==
Seven-string guitars are used in a variety of musical styles including classical, jazz, rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal. The seven-string works well in a band setting, as its lowest note, B1 lines up well with the B0 commonly used for the lowest note of a 5+ string bass. Both the guitar and bass could drop tune as well using a lowest note of A1 and A0 respectively (with the bass this extends the range to the lowest note on a standard piano). 

The guitar is main contributor to giving the nu metal band Korn its “signature sound”.

There&#x27;s also the 14-string guitar, which can be thought of as either a 12-string guitar w/ a Low B octave course added to it, or as a seven-string guitar with seven pairs of strings giving it a really nice shimmer.

<text>The dust jacket (sometimes book jacket, dust wrapper or dust cover) of a book is the detachable outer cover, usually made of paper and printed with text and illustrations. This outer cover has folded flaps that hold it to the front and back book covers; these flaps may also double as bookmarks.

Dust jackets originally displayed cover information on top of a simple binding, at a time when it was not feasible to print directly onto the binding. The role of a dust jacket has been largely supplanted by modern hardcover printing technologies, which print such information directly onto the binding.

Modern dust covers still serve to display promotional material and shield the book from damage. The back panel or flaps of the dust cover are printed with biographical information about the author, a summary of the book from the publisher (known as a blurb) or critical praise from celebrities or authorities in the book&#x27;s subject area. The back of a dust jacket often has a barcode for retail purchase, and the book&#x27;s ISBN. The information on the dust jacket often resembles that of the binding but may have additional promotions about an edition, and the information on the flaps is not typically copied onto the binding.

The dust jacket protects the book covers from damage. However, since it is itself relatively fragile, and since dust jackets have practical, aesthetic, and sometimes financial value, the jacket may in turn be wrapped in another jacket, usually transparent, especially if the book is a library volume.

== Early history ==
Before the 1820s, most books were published unbound and were generally sold to customers either in this form, or in simple bindings executed for the bookseller, or in bespoke bindings commissioned by the customer. At this date, publishers did not have their books bound in uniform &quot;house&quot; bindings, so there was no reason for them to issue dust jackets. Book owners did occasionally fashion their own jackets out of leather, wallpaper, fur, or other material, and many other types of detachable protective covers were made for codices, manuscripts, and scrolls from ancient times through the Middle Ages and into the modern period.

At the end of the 18th century, publishers began to issue books in plain paper-covered boards, sometimes with a printed spine label; this form of binding was intended to be temporary. Some collections of loose prints were issued at this period in printed paper wrappings, again intended to be temporary. In the first two decades of the nineteenth century, publishers started issuing some smaller books in bindings of printed paper-covered boards, and throughout the 1820s and 1830s some small popular books, notably annual gift books and almanacs, were issued in detachable printed pasteboard sheaths. These small boxes are sometimes loosely and erroneously referred to as the first dust jackets. True publisher&#x27;s bindings in cloth and leather, in which all, or a substantial part of, an edition were bound, were also introduced shortly before 1820, by the innovative publisher William Pickering.

===Oldest dust jackets===
After publishers&#x27; cloth bindings started coming into common use on all types of books in the 1820s, the first publishers&#x27; dust jackets appeared by the end of that decade. The earliest known examples were issued on English literary annuals which were popular from the 1820s to the 1850s. These books often had fancy bindings that needed protection. The jackets that were used at this time completely enclosed the books like wrapping paper and were sealed shut with wax or glue.

The oldest publishers&#x27; dust jacket now on record was issued in 1829 on an English annual, &quot;Friendship&#x27;s Offering&quot; for 1830. It was discovered at the Bodleian Library in Oxford by Michael Turner, a former curator and Head of Conservation at the Library. Its existence was announced by Oxford in 2009. It is three years older than the previous oldest known jacket, which was discovered in 1934 by the English bookman John Carter on another English annual, &quot;The Keepsake&quot; for 1833 (issued in 1832). Both jackets are of the type that completely enclosed the books.

Most jackets of this type were torn when they were opened and then discarded like gift-wrapping paper; they were not designed to be reused, and surviving examples are known on only a handful of titles. The scarcity of jackets of this type, together with the lack of written documentation from publishers of the period, makes it very hard to determine how widely these all-enclosing jackets were used during the period from 1820 to 1850, but they were likely common on ornately bound annuals and on some trade books.

The earliest known dust jackets of the modern style, with flaps, which covered just the binding and left the text block exposed, date from the 1850s, although this type of jacket was likely in at least limited use some years earlier. This is the jacket that became standard in the publishing industry and is still in use today. It is believed that flap-style jackets were in general use by the 1880s, and probably earlier, although the number of surviving examples from the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s is too small to prove exactly when they became ubiquitous, and again, there are no known publishers&#x27; records that document the use of dust jackets during these decades. There are, however, enough surviving examples from the 1890s to state unequivocally that dust jackets were all but universal throughout that decade. They were probably issued more often than not by the 1860s and 1870s in Europe, Great Britain, and the United States.

==Late 19th and early 20th centuries==
Throughout the nineteenth century, nearly all dust jackets were discarded at or soon after purchase. Many were discarded in bookstores as the books were put out for display, or when they were sold; there is evidence that this was common practice in England until World War I. The period from the 1820s to 1900 was a golden age for publishers&#x27; decorative bookbinding, and most dust jackets were much plainer than the books they covered, often simply repeating the main elements of the binding decoration in black on cream or brown paper. For this reason, most people preferred to display their books in their bindings, much as earlier generations had displayed their library books in their gold-tooled individual bindings, usually in leather or vellum. Even late in the nineteenth century there were still some publishers who were not using dust jackets at all (the English publisher Methuen is one example). Some firms, such as subscription houses which sold millions of cheap books door-to-door, probably never used them.

Cloth dust jackets became popular late in the nineteenth century. These jackets, with the outer cloth usually reinforced with an underlayer of paper, were issued mostly on ornate gift editions, often in two volumes and often with a slipcase. Other types of publishers&#x27; boxes were also popular in the second half of the nineteenth century, including many made to hold multi-volume sets of books. The jackets on boxed volumes were often plain, sometimes with cutouts on the spine to allow the title or volume numbers of the books to be seen.

After 1900, fashion and the economics of publishing caused book bindings to become less decorative, and it was cheaper for publishers to make the jackets more attractive. By around 1920, most of the artwork and decoration had migrated from the binding to the dust jacket, and jackets were routinely printed with multiple colors, extensive advertising and blurbs; even the underside of the jacket was now sometimes used for advertising.

As dust jackets became more attractive than the bindings, more people began to keep the jackets on their books, at least until they became soiled, torn, or worn out. One bit of evidence that indicates when jackets became saved objects is the movement of the printed price from the spine of the jacket to a corner of one of the flaps. This also occurred in the 1910s and early 1920s. When jackets were routinely discarded at point of purchase, it did not matter where the price was printed (and many early jackets were not printed with any price), but now if book buyers of the 1910s and 1920s wanted to save the jacket and give a book as a gift, they could clip off the price without ruining the jacket.

In 1939, Arthur Brody, a student at Columbia University, invented a film-based jacket, which is used by libraries to protect paper dust jackets.

=== Supplementary bands ===
In Japan, both hardcover and softcover books frequently come with two dust jackets – a full-sized one, serving the same purpose as in the West (it is usually retained with the book), and a thin &quot;obi&quot; (&quot;belt&quot;; colloquially &quot;belly band&quot; in English), which is generally disposed of and serves a similar function to 19th-century Western dust jackets.

Similar bands occasionally appear in the west, for example in Palookaville #20.

==As collectible items==
Dust jackets from the 1920s and later were often decorated in art deco styles which are highly prized by collectors. Some of them are worth far more than the books they cover. The most famous example is the jacket on the first edition of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald, published in 1925. Without jacket, the book brings $1,000 or so. With the jacket it can bring $20,000 or $30,000 or more, depending on condition. One copy in a near mint jacket was listed for sale in 2009 for half a million dollars. The most valuable jackets are usually those on the high spots of literature. Condition is of paramount importance to value. Other examples of highly prized jackets include those on most of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s titles, and the first editions of books such as Harper Lee&#x27;s &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, among many others. Prices for dust jackets have become so inflated in recent years that even early reprints of certain titles in jacket can command good prices. Conversely, if the book itself is unimportant, or at least has little demand, the jacket is usually of little value either, but nearly all surviving pre-1920 jackets add some additional value to the book they cover.

Some collectors and dealers, in an effort to increase the value of a first edition that has lost its original jacket, will take a jacket from a later printing and &quot;marry&quot; it to the earlier one. This practice persists because some customers will pay more for a first edition in a later jacket than they would for a jacketless copy. However, switching jackets muddles the bibliographical record and creates a forgery of sorts.

<doc id="608910" wikidata="Q664526" url="?curid=608910" title="Nick Jr.">
<text>Nick Jr. (sometimes disambiguated as Nick Jr. on Nickelodeon or Nick Jr. on Nick, and sometimes referred to as Nick, Jr.) is an American morning programming block that airs on Nickelodeon every weekday. It was launched on January 4, 1988. Nick Jr. features a lineup of shows aimed at children aged 2 through 8.

In 2009, Nickelodeon launched a separate channel named after the Nick Jr. block as a replacement for the original Noggin cable channel. The channel is known on air as the &quot;Nick Jr. Channel&quot; to differentiate the two services.

==History==
===Early years (1988–93)===
Since its launch on April 1, 1979, and throughout the 1980s, Nickelodeon aired programs for preschoolers (most prominently &quot;Pinwheel&quot; and &quot;Today&#x27;s Special&quot;) on weekdays from 8:00 am – 2:00 pm and weekend mornings. After Nickelodeon&#x27;s preschool block premiered a slew of new shows in 1987, it began using the Nick Junior branding on , coinciding with the premiere of the Spanish program &quot;The World of David the Gnome&quot;. A new rebrand for the block that abbreviated its name to &quot;Nick Jr.&quot; was gradually rolled out from September 5, 1988 to the summer of 1989. Nick Jr.&#x27;s new logo was orange for &#x27;Nick&#x27; and blue for &#x27;Jr.&#x27;, and it varied in the shape or species (e.g.: two gears, trains, robots, planets, insects, comets, or elephants). Like with Nickelodeon, Nick Jr.&#x27;s network IDs featured the block&#x27;s logo in different shapes and styles. At launch, the block aired from 8:30 am – 2:30 pm. On weekends, preschool programs aired at earlier hours of the day, and in the case of &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; went unbranded.

Until June 29, 1990, &quot;Pinwheel&quot; was featured, originally for three hours (two in the morning and one at noon), then for one hour starting in spring 1989. When Nick Jr.&#x27;s original series &quot;Eureeka&#x27;s Castle&quot; premiered in September, &quot;Pinwheel&quot; was split into two separate half hours in the morning and afternoon, where it remained until June 29, 1990, after which the block was truncated to run from 9:30 am to 2:30 pm on July 2, 1990, another solidified timing from 9:30 am to 2:00 pm on June 15, 1992, and lastly from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm on October 5. Much of Nick Jr.&#x27;s other programs at the time were of Japanese or foreign origin (including &quot;Fred Penner&#x27;s Place&quot;, &quot;Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram&#x27;s Elephant Show&quot;, &quot;Adventures of the Little Koala&quot;, &quot;Noozles&quot;, &quot;Maya the Bee&quot;, and &quot;The Littl&#x27; Bits&quot;).

===Grow, Learn, and Play (1993–94)===
On , Nick Jr. premiered a new series, &quot;Cappelli &amp; Company&quot;, and received a new rebrand which prominently featured a new logo consisting of an orange parent and a blue child, and the slogan &quot;Grow, Learn, and Play&quot;. Several Nick Jr. bumpers featured kids playing near a Nick Jr. logo and a theme song with the slogan sung to the melody of &quot;London Bridge&quot;, and interstitials were created featuring &quot;Cappelli &amp; Company&quot; host Frank Cappelli on the set. Nick Jr. also started using a female announcer (who was replaced by a different one) in its promos and bumpers. Nick Jr. began to invest more into producing original interstitial series (including 1994&#x27;s &quot;Muppet Time&quot;, forty two-minute shorts from The Jim Henson Company) in order to stay within a self-imposed limit of five minutes of commercials per hour. 

On April 4, 1994, the &quot;Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppet Hour&quot; sub-block was created by pairing &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; reruns with the new acquisition &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. Due to Nick Jr.&#x27;s declining ratings as well as competition from PBS&#x27; children&#x27;s programs and TLC&#x27;s Ready Set Learn block, Nickelodeon spent $30 million revamping the Nick Jr. block over the next three years. On June 13, older-skewing Nickelodeon series &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, and &quot;Lassie&quot; joined Nick Jr.&#x27;s lineup, as the block&#x27;s branding was temporarily de-emphasized in favor of regular Nickelodeon branding until October 21.

===Just for Me/Play to Learn (1994–2003)===
On , the Nick Jr. block returned with new on-air branding and premiered two new original series, &quot;Gullah Gullah Island&quot; and &quot;Allegra&#x27;s Window&quot;, resulting in 50% rating gains for the block. Nick Jr. also introduced Face, an animated mascot that introduced shows and interstitials and led into commercial breaks. In the context of his segments, Face was capable of materializing objects such as an astronaut, a robot, a clown, a window, a traffic light, stars, and even wood. He was also capable of creating a number of Foley sound effects and voices including an iconic signature three-note trumpet noise usually following the name &quot;Nick Jr.&quot; at the end of almost every bumper. Also, he changed colors, moods, and feelings. Face was voiced by Chris Phillips, who also narrated several Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. promos. 

In 1995, Nick Jr. acquired broadcast rights to &quot;The Busy World of Richard Scarry&quot; from sister network Showtime, and later premiered &quot;Rupert&quot; on September 11 and &quot;Little Bear&quot; on November 6 (both were produced by the Canadian animation studio Nelvana). 

Nick Jr. received a new rebrand produced by Pittard Sullivan on . On September 8, the first episode of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; premiered in primetime on Nick at Nite, then aired on Nick Jr. the next day. &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; quickly deposed &quot;Gullah Gullah Island&quot; as Nick Jr.&#x27;s most popular series. &quot;Rugrats&quot; was pushed out of Nick Jr.&#x27;s lineup after May 2, 1997, to make room for second showings of &quot;Little Bear&quot; and &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;. &quot;The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss&quot; replaced &quot;Papa Beaver&#x27;s Storytime&quot; on October 7, 1997, after a series of occasional airings on the block from October 21, 1996, to February 1997. On March 16, 1998, the &quot;nickjr.com&quot; website was launched. Later that year, Nick Jr. rebranded again and introduced the &quot;Just for Me&quot; slogan. A sign-on and sign-off bumper featuring the &quot;Just for Me&quot; slogan was used on Nick Jr. video releases from 2000–04.

In the first quarter of 1999, Nick Jr. premiered three new series based on books, &quot;Franklin&quot; on January 11, and &quot;Kipper&quot; and &quot;Maisy&quot; in February, which helped increase the block&#x27;s ratings. &quot;Little Bill&quot; premiered later in 1999; the series&#x27; first episodes premiered on Nickelodeon Sunday nights before airing on Nick Jr. the next day. Nick Jr. briefly aired reruns of &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; beginning June 5, 2000 (&quot;Maggie and the Ferocious Beast&quot; premiered on the same day) to promote the film &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;, before replacing it with &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; on August 14, which became one of Nick Jr.&#x27;s most successful series.

The US dub of &quot;Bob the Builder&quot; premiered on Nickelodeon on January 13, 2001, before airing on Nick Jr. two days later; &quot;Oswald&quot; premiered on August 20. On , Nick Jr. received a new rebrand produced by AdamsMorioka (who had previously rebranded Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite) and Editional Effects, intended to have a greater appeal towards parents. In the spring of 2002, Nick Jr. altered the format of its commercial breaks, resulting in the removal of older network IDs dating back to 1994. Beginning on January 10, 2003, &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; and &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; were placed in Nick Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Play Along Time&quot; sub-block. On April 7, the day that sister network Noggin rebranded and introduced mascots Moose and Zee, Nick Jr. aired some of Noggin&#x27;s new original series (&quot;Oobi&quot;, &quot;Tweenies&quot;, and &quot;Miffy and Friends&quot;) as a cross-promotion. Nick Jr. continued to air &quot;Tweenies&quot; from July to September 25.

On August 29, 2003, the original Face interstitials ended their almost 9-year run.

===Play Along (2003–04)===

On , Nick Jr. received a rebrand that introduced more than a dozen new logos; British program &quot;Rubbadubbers&quot; premiered the next day. A new interstitial series called &quot;Nick Jr. Play Along&quot; was introduced, hosted by two live-action hosts: Robin (played by actress Hillary Hawkins) and Zack (played by actor Travis Guba). Along with Robin and Zack were two sock puppets called the Feetbeats. Face was given a brand new look which added eyebrows and a chin and straightened his eyes by inverting their colors from white dots on black eyes to actual-looking eyes, and was voiced by Nick on CBS announcer Babi Floyd. The new Face promos were produced by Virtual Persuasion. Starting the following year in September, Nick Jr. used a new on-screen bug to promote its website until two years later on February 28.

On October 8, 2004, the new Face interstitials ended their 1-year run alongside most of Nick Jr.&#x27;s older interstitial series.

===Love to Play! (2004–07)===
On , Nick Jr. received another rebrand containing interstitials co-produced with Little Airplane Productions featuring the block&#x27;s new mascot Piper O&#x27;Possum (voiced by Ali Brustofski and created by Josh Selig), and the new slogan &quot;Love to Play!&quot;. Nick Jr.&#x27;s female announcer was replaced with Kobie Powell and Chris Phillips. &quot;LazyTown&quot;, &quot;Miss Spider&#x27;s Sunny Patch Friends&quot;, &quot;Blue&#x27;s Room&quot;, and &quot;The Backyardigans&quot; (the latter of which premiering alongside the rebrand) premiered on Nick Jr. Nick Jr.&#x27;s commercial limit increased to 8 minutes per hour, and the block began airing more interstitials that were clips from its&#x27; shows. &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; spin-off &quot;Go, Diego, Go!&quot; premiered, whilst &quot;Wonder Pets!&quot; and &quot;Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!&quot; debuted the following year. &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; debuted the following year, and was the only Nick Jr. series to premiere that year.

On September 7, 2007, the Piper O&#x27;Possum interstitials ended their almost 3-year run.

===Play with Us!/Play Date (2007–09)===
On , Nick Jr. received another rebrand nicknamed &quot;Nick Jr. Play Date&quot;. A new slogan, &quot;Play with Us!&quot;, was also included. The bumpers encouraged preschoolers to play along and featured the Nick Jr. logo in the form of two stop-motion plushies. This marked the first time that Nick Jr. had no mascot since 13 years. 5 months later on February 18, the March &#x27;06 on-screen bugs were replaced with three new bugs reflecting the branding. Nick Jr. began its broadcast at 8:30 am starting the following week.

On January 30, 2009, the &quot;Play Date&quot; interstitials ended their 1.5-year run.

===Nickelodeon rebranding (2009–14)===

On , the Nick Jr. block rebranded as &quot;Nickelodeon Play Date&quot;, as part of an effort to unite the Nickelodeon channel&#x27;s programs under a single brand. The block&#x27;s commercial limit increased again to 10 minutes per hour. NickJr.com continued to use the Nick Jr. brand name to categorize all of Nickelodeon&#x27;s preschool programming. The block initially retained the &quot;Play with Us!&quot; brand, alongside new branding designed by Melinda Beck, and many bumpers featured drawings, finger puppets or cupcakes. The bumpers&#x27; music was a choir of kids vocalizing, and Nicolette Pierini was the announcer of each bumper. The Nickelodeon splat logo was edited onto the block&#x27;s split-screen credits design and interstitials predating the &quot;Play with Us!&quot; brand. Starting on June 29 of that year, the split-screen credits were replaced to match the branding, officially retiring the &quot;Play with Us!&quot; branding. On September 28 of that year, the Nick Jr. channel was launched, replacing Noggin. That same day, the block became simply known as &quot;Nick&#x27;s Play Date&quot; or just &quot;Play Date&quot;. &quot;Nick&#x27;s Play Date&quot; began its broadcast at 7:00 am a year later starting in the summer. The following year, &quot;Nick&#x27;s Play Date&quot; received a new rebrand featuring characters from the block&#x27;s shows. That same year, &quot;Nick’s Play Date&quot; stopped using the branding’s split-screen credits, and started using Nickelodeon’s split-screen credits design. The following year, the &quot;Play Date&quot; branding was replaced with a modified version of the Nick Jr. channel&#x27;s new branding known as &quot;Nick: The Smart Place to Play&quot;, and the block stopped airing most interstitials. Despite Nickelodeon displaying its shows&#x27; credits during the last 30 seconds before it, the branding retained the split-screen credits for Nick Jr. shows airing on the block until .

===Return of Nick Jr. branding (2014–23)===

On , &quot;Nick: The Smart Place to Play&quot; reverted back to the normal Nick Jr. name and began calling itself &quot;Nick Jr. on Nickelodeon&quot; or &quot;Nick Jr. on Nick&quot; while still using a Nickelodeon screen bug. When aired on the Nick Jr. channel, commercials for programs broadcast on Nickelodeon&#x27;s Nick Jr. block usually end with &quot;Over on Nick&quot; or &quot;Over on Nickelodeon&quot; to differentiate the titles. On the same day, the Nick Jr. block also began to use Nickelodeon&#x27;s on-screen credits to include more commercials (now 12 minutes per hour). The following year on June 10, the Nick Jr. website was fully redesigned to match up with the Nick Jr. app.

On , the Nick Jr. block rebranded with new bumpers and curriculum boards. Nick Jr. began its broadcast at 7:00 am once again for the first time since a decade two years later starting in the fall. As of fall two years later, the Nick Jr. block has been extended to sign off at 3:00 pm, but by January 2, it reverted to having a 2 p.m. sign off time.

===Return of Nickelodeon branding (2023–present)===
On , the Nick Jr. block was rebranded to include a refreshed splat logo and used the Nickelodeon name in the refreshed bumpers, as well as refreshed curriculum boards, while the Nick Jr. channel eventually adopted the full rebrand on September 4.

==Programming==
===Other Nick Jr. blocks for broadcast networks===
Nick Jr. programs and interstitial segments appeared as a Saturday morning block on CBS entitled &quot; Nick Jr. on CBS&quot;. It was part of the general &quot;Nick on CBS&quot; block, which also included programming from the main Nickelodeon channel until 2 years later on September 18, when it switched back to its previous format. It ended after Viacom and CBS Corporation were separated (but re-merged in later years) and was replaced by the &quot;KOL Secret Slumber Party&quot; block.

Spanish-language US network Telemundo has aired &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; (Spanish &quot;Pistas De Blue&quot;) (as part of the &quot;Nickelodeon en Telemundo&quot; block) and &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; (Spanish &quot;Dora la Exploradora&quot;) (as part of the &quot;Telemundo Kids&quot; block) in Spanish. Competing Spanish network Univision added Spanish-dubbed versions of &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Go, Diego, Go!&quot; to their Saturday morning &quot;Planeta U&quot; line-up. A Spanish-dubbed version of &quot;The Backyardigans&quot; was later added to the lineup.

Tr3s, a sister network to Nickelodeon, aired a daily block of Spanish-dubbed Nick Jr. programs under the name &quot;Tr3s Jr.&quot; to meet E/I requirements for its broadcast affiliates. Shows like &quot;Pistas de Blue&quot; (the Spanish version of &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot;) and &quot;Wonder Pets!&quot; were featured in the block.

===Face&#x27;s reappearances===
The 90s Face made an appearance during the New Year edition of The &#x27;90s Are All That, TeenNick&#x27;s former retro-oriented late-night block. Face&#x27;s appearances consisted of out-of-context clips that make him appear to be drunk or making adult comments (e.g.: &quot;Yeah, grow a pair!&quot;). 

For the Halloween/Nick or Treat season, the &quot;Face the Monster&quot; bumper would play on the block as a transition of introducing episodes of &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; on The Splat. The same bumper would be used on the block as an April Fools&#x27; Day prank two years later on April 1.

Face also appeared in an Easter promo for The Splat, encouraging viewers to look for the Easter bunny in 90s Nickelodeon shows.

A re-designed Face voiced by Cedric Williams hosted the Nick Jr. show &quot;Face&#x27;s Music Party&quot;. Face&#x27;s original voice actor Chris Phillips continued to narrate promos for Nick Jr.

<text>A slipcase is a five-sided box, usually made of high-quality cardboard, into which binders, books or book sets are &quot;slipped&quot; for protection, leaving the spine exposed. Special editions of books are often slipcased for a stylish appearance when placed on a bookshelf. A few publishers, such as the Folio Society, publish nearly all their books in slipcases.

Protective slipcases have been issued for records, cassettes, 8-track tapes, film, video cassettes, compact discs, DVDs and even toys instead of or in addition to the more common jewel cases or keep case, and may be chosen for aesthetic or economic reasons. Larger slipcases that are designed to house one or more items are often used in packaging for special edition releases or box sets.

<text>The Enclave (&quot;De Enclave&quot;) is a three-part series directed by Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen, about the fall of Srebrenica and the Dutch government&#x27;s failure to protect the town from attackers. The series originally aired by Netherlands Public Broadcasting. The series was made in 2002. It has since been condensed into a movie and is regularly shown on US free satellite network LinkTV.

In the original series, each episode describes the Srebrenica massacre from one of three different points of view, including how the event continues to influence the characters. In the movie version, only two points of view were shown.

&quot;The following episode descriptions were taken from the Dutch Public Broadcasting website.&quot;

==Episode 1==
As a young Bosniak, Ibro Hadzic had worked as an interpreter for Dutchbat (Dutch UN peacekeeping force) at the time of the fall of Srebrenica. He has since built up a new life for himself and now is married to Sandra, a Dutchbatter (Dutch soldier), who is expecting his first child.

While working as an interpreter at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Ibro is confronted with former Bosnian Serb officer Darko Bokan (Frank Lammers), who Ibro thinks is the man who murdered his family during the fall of Srebrenica. Ibro&#x27;s past, bottled-up until now, comes back to haunt him as, with mounting obsession, he starts digging into Bokan&#x27;s role in his family&#x27;s murder.

==Episode 2==
When Ibro Hadzic learns that Darko Bokan will be acquitted due to lack of evidence, Ibro has other plans to try Darko. Ibro takes Bokan hostage and forces him to confess to what he &quot;did&quot; in the past while the world watched the events on television. Ibro then makes it clear that he wants the former Defence Minister George Terhoff, whom he holds responsible for losing his family, to change places with Bokan. Terhoff enters the room with police and arrests Ibro.

==Episode 3==
Former Defence Minister George Terhoff travels to Srebrenica with his wife and daughter. He is confronted with the consequences of the decisions he made at the time of the war. The sudden disappearance of his daughter forces him to start a search. As he passes through all the places that bear silent witness to the fall of Srebrenica, he remembers the traumatic hours he spent in the bunker where he was expected to make life and death decisions. He now experiences the frantic uncertainty that Ibro must have faced. He is eventually brutally confronted with his own past.

This episode was not included in the movie version.

<text>A presentation copy is a copy of a book that has been presented, usually by the author or someone associated with the book&#x27;s production, to another individual. The copy usually contains a presentation inscription identifying it as a presentation copy, such as an author&#x27;s signature. A simple Latin inscription is &quot;ex dono authoris&quot; (&quot;from the author&#x27;s gift&quot;). In manuscripts from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a presentation copy often contained a presentation miniature, a small painting depicting the author giving a copy to a recipient.

There are three types of presentation copy. The first and most common is that given by the author or someone associated with the book&#x27;s production, such as the printer or illustrator. The second includes special presentation copies prepared for prominent individuals, such as kings. A small number of presentation copies are associated neither with the book&#x27;s producers nor famous individuals and are notable only for the usually fine details of binding or printing. Unqualified, the term &quot;presentation copy&quot; always suggests a copy gifted by the author.

A dedication copy is a copy presented to the dedicatee. They rank highly among presentation copies in collectors&#x27; estimations. An inscribed copy is not a presentation copy, but is signed by the author at the book owner&#x27;s request. Presentation copies are generally more valuable and rarer than inscribed copies. Even presentation copies vary in value depending on their closeness to the author. The most valuable are those that have the author&#x27;s dated autograph from the time of publication.

==Examples of presentation copies==
* &quot;Plays, Never Before Printed&quot; (1668), signed by Margaret Cavendish at the Folger Shakespeare Library
* &quot;An Account of the Abipones&quot; (1784), presentation copy from John Carter Brown to John R. Bartlett at the John Hay Library, Brown University
* &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (1887), signed &quot;With the Author&#x27;s Compliments&quot; by Arthur Conan Doyle at the Beinecke Library, Yale University
* &quot;The Nursery &quot;Alice&quot;&quot; (1889), dedicated by Lewis Carroll, sold by Sotheby&#x27;s in 2012 for £36,050

<doc id="608926" wikidata="Q931544" url="?curid=608926" title="Half Japanese">
<text>Half Japanese is an American art punk band formed by brothers Jad and David Fair in 1974, after their family&#x27;s relocation to Uniontown, Maryland. 

Half Japanese&#x27; original instrumentation included a small drum set, which they took turns playing; vocals; and an out-of-tune, distorted guitar. Both Fair brothers sang, although over time Jad held the frontman role. As of the band&#x27;s last several releases since the 1990s, according to the album and CD credits, Half Japanese composes and plays the entirety of the music while Fair, eschewing his role as guitarist from earlier albums, plays almost no guitar but is responsible for the vocals and lyrics, which typically divide into either &quot;love songs or monster songs.&quot;

==Band history==
Their lyrics often deal with monsters and the supernatural (especially as influenced by &quot;creature feature&quot; and sci-fi movies), in addition to more conventional themes, such as young love.

The band was formed in Jad and David Fair&#x27;s bedroom in the mid-1970s, with sources varying on the exact date. The band released their first single, &quot;Calling All Girls&quot;, in August 1977, followed by a triple album, &quot;1/2 Gentlemen/Not Beasts&quot; in 1980. 

The band played and recorded as a duo until the early 1980s, when they began incorporating additional members into the group: Mark Jickling (guitar and vocals) and brothers Ricky and John Dreyfuss (drums and saxophone). Since that time, dozens of musicians have come and gone under the Half Japanese banner, including Howard Wuelfing, Don Fleming and Jay Spiegel both from the band Velvet Monkeys, and Shockabilly bass player and Shimmy Disc impresario Mark Kramer among others. Jad is the only member who has been with Half Japanese from the beginning. David temporarily left the band in 1987 in order to take care of his family, and since then has been involved with the band sporadically.

The next line-up of Half Japanese came together in the late 1980s, proving to be a long-lasting and stable unit recording several albums and touring frequently throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan. This incarnation featured guitarist/multi-instrumentalist John Sluggett (also a longtime member of Moe Tucker&#x27;s band), multi-instrumentalist Jason Willett, Mick Hobbs, and drummer Gilles Reider. Since then, the group has worked with Moe Tucker from The Velvet Underground, who produced and performed on &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; (1992), as well as &quot;The Band That Would Be King&quot; (1989), and with Fred Frith, and John Zorn, among others.

In 1993, the band was brought to greater exposure when they opened for Nirvana&#x27;s 1993 &quot;In Utero&quot; tour on dates in the US East Coast. Kurt Cobain would later wear a Half Japanese T-shirt when he died. The band&#x27;s history and influence are chronicled in the 1993 documentary &quot;Half Japanese: The Band That Would Be King&quot; by Jeff Feuerzeig. In 1997, the band signed with the Alternative Tentacles label and released the album &quot;Bone Head&quot;. The same year, they self-released the album &quot;Heaven Sent&quot; on the label of drummer Gilles-Vincent Reider. In 2001, they released their second album on Alternative Tentacles, &quot;Hello&quot;. 

The band was chosen by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that he curated in March 2012 in Minehead. In September 2014, the band released the album &quot;Overjoyed&quot; on Joyful Noise Recordings, their first in 13 years, which was followed by the limited edition &quot;Bingo Ringo&quot; EP the following year. The band subsequently moved to Fire Records released the albums &quot;Hear the Lions Roar&quot; in 2017, &quot;Why Not?&quot; in 2018, &quot; Invincible&quot; in 2019 and &quot;Crazy Hearts&quot; in 2020. In 2021, &quot;I Guess I’m Living: The Charmed Life Tapes&quot;, an alternate recording of their 1988 album &quot;Charmed Life&quot; containing previously unreleased material was released exclusively on Record Store Day. July 2023 saw their twentieth studio album, &quot; Jump into Love&quot;.

<text>The Buckley School is a private, college preparatory day school for students in grades kindergarten through 12. Founded in 1933 by Isabelle Buckley, the school is located in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles, California, in the United States. Buckley is one of the oldest co-educational day schools in the Los Angeles area.

==Description==
The Buckley School is a K–12 school that enrolls a total of 830 students. Approximate division sizes are 270 in grade K–5; 210 in grades 6–8; and 345 in grades 9–12, allowing for an average class size of 17 students. The school&#x27;s Middle and Upper divisions follow a six-day block schedule, with 70-minute class intervals. The school&#x27;s Lower division follows a five-day schedule and combines a developmental approach with structure. All divisions are located on a single 18-acre campus in Sherman Oaks, California. Buckley is accredited by the California Association of Independent Schools, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, and the California Department of Education. It is also a member of the National Association of Independent Schools.

==History==
The Buckley School was founded as an &quot;independent co-educational institution&quot; by Isabelle Buckley in 1933 based on her own &quot;4-Fold Plan of Education&quot;, which equally emphasizes academics, arts, athletics, and an ethical education. Early campuses were located on Doheny Drive in Los Angeles, on Hayvenhurst Avenue in Van Nuys, and the school had two locations in Sherman Oaks, on Riverside Drive and Woodman Avenue. In 1964, Isabelle Buckley purchased land from the Glenaire Country Club in Sherman Oaks, and by 1973 all five divisions of the school were consolidated at the Stansbury Avenue location. In 2008, the city of Los Angeles approved campus enhancements to be completed over a six-year (non-consecutive) total building period. Construction began in 2011; Phase III of Buckley&#x27;s Campus Enhancement Plan began in late 2014 and was scheduled to end in late 2016.

By the end of 2016, the school added three new buildings to support academics, including specialized science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) classrooms, as well as the performing arts, including dance and music rehearsal spaces, a black-box theatre, and a performance and community gathering space. Improvements also have included a renovated Middle and Upper School library and administrative offices, renovated classrooms and Lower School administrative offices.

During 2019, several Buckley School families were implicated in the Varsity Blues scandal. In an attempt to better their children&#x27;s odds at getting into elite colleges and university&#x27;s, Buckley parents paid Rick Singer to get their children into elite colleges including the Georgetown University and Tulane University. One Buckley parent, Devin Sloane, plead guilty to paying Singer $250,000 to get his son into the University of Southern California as a water polo recruit.

== Board of trustees ==
The Buckley Board of Trustees is composed of current parents, alumni, parents of alumni, and friends of the school who go through a rigorous vetting and training process facilitated by the committee on trustees. The composition of the board changes every year, as terms expire and new trustees are elected. Trustees can serve up to three, three-year terms and participate in at least two board committees each year of their trusteeship. Buckley&#x27;s trustees emeriti include Maurice Marciano, Philip de Toledo, and Terry Semel.

== Campus ==
Buckley&#x27;s Lower, Middle, and Upper divisions share a single 18-acre (7.3 ha) campus. According to the school&#x27;s website, facilities include more than 60 classrooms, two libraries, an indoor gymnasium and theatre, a 4-acre (1.6 ha) outdoor field and stadium with views of the San Fernando Valley, an indoor pool, a weight-training facility, an outdoor basketball court, two Lower School play yards, a nature trail, and an outdoor classroom. The campus also houses Cafe Commons, the schools cafeteria, which features fresh, made to order breakfast and lunch, paninis, snacks, drinks, and frozen yogurt. Buckley is one of the oldest co-educational day schools in Los Angeles, and one of the few with all K–12 students on one campus. The school&#x27;s Academic and Performing Arts Building opened in 2012, followed by its Mathematics and Science Building in 2013. These buildings feature modern music, theater, dance, and art classrooms, as well as a new theatre, journalism classroom, student technology center, digital arts and music center, and science classrooms with prep areas for labs. Buckley&#x27;s Center for Community and the Arts was completed in 2016 and houses English classrooms and a state-of-the-art theatre for all of the school&#x27;s productions. The space is dynamic; walls are opened to reveal an outdoor courtyard and community gathering space.

==Culture==
The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Dare to Be True&quot;. The &quot;Buckley Commitment&quot;, which is displayed in all classrooms and is ceremonially signed by students and teachers at the start of each academic year, sets expectations for respect, kindness, honesty, loyalty, self-discipline and self-reliance. The school&#x27;s dress code dates back to its founding and has been modernized in the intervening years. Today, boys wear a combination of polo shirts, khakis pants, chinos, black jeans or shorts, sweaters in the school&#x27;s colors (red, black, or gray) and Buckley sweatshirts; girls wear skirts, black jeans, sweaters in school colors, polo shirts, or Buckley sweatshirts. Buckley&#x27;s mascot is the griffin.

Buckley offers student activities, as well as after-school and summer programs. Interscholastic sports include baseball for male students and softball and volleyball for female students; co-ed sports include basketball, cross-country running, track and field, equestrian sports, soccer, swimming and diving, golf, fencing, and tennis. The school maintains a no-cut policy in Middle School athletics.

The school&#x27;s newspaper is &quot;The Student Voice&quot;. In 1998, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; presented the school with a &quot;general excellence award&quot; as part of its annual High School Journalism Awards competition, earning Buckley $1,000 for its journalism program. In 2010 and 2012, &quot;The Student Voice&quot; received &quot;High School Newspaper Silver Crown&quot; awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association (CSPA). In 2015, individual contributors were recognized in the categories &quot;Sidebar writing&quot;, &quot;Sports Page Design&quot;, and &quot;Single Subject News or Feature Package, Double-truck or Special Section Design&quot; at the CSPA&#x27;s 32nd Gold Circle Awards.

In 2002, the Performing Arts Department collaborated with writer and director Stuart Ross to present the world premiere of &quot;The Sounds of Plaid&quot;, a large-cast, co-ed version of Ross&#x27;s &quot;Forever Plaid&quot;. In 2015, 34 students won 60 Scholastic Art Awards, which have been presented to student artists in grades 7–12 nationwide since 1923. Students earned awards in thirteen categories: architecture, ceramics and glass, comic art, design, digital art, drawing and illustration, fashion, film and animation, jewelry, mixed media, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and art portfolio.

<text>Marginalia (or apostils) are marks made in the margins of a book or other document. They may be scribbles, comments, glosses (annotations), critiques, doodles, drolleries, or illuminations.

==Biblical manuscripts==
Biblical manuscripts have notes in the margin, for liturgical use. Numbers of texts&#x27; divisions are given at the margin (, Ammonian Sections, Eusebian Canons). There are some scholia, corrections and other notes usually made later by hand in the margin. Marginalia may also be of relevance because many ancient or medieval writers of marginalia may have had access to other relevant texts that, although they may have been widely copied at the time, have since then been lost due to wars, prosecution, or censorship. As such, they might give clues to an earlier, more widely known context of the extant form of the underlying text than is currently appreciated. For this reason, scholars of ancient texts usually try to find as many still existing manuscripts of the texts they are researching, because the notes scribbled in the margin might contain additional clues to the interpretation of these texts.

==History==

The scholia on classical manuscripts are the earliest known form of marginalia.

In Europe, before the invention of the printing press, books were copied by hand, originally onto vellum and later onto paper. Paper was expensive and vellum was much more expensive. A single book cost as much as a house. Books, therefore, were long-term investments expected to be handed down to succeeding generations. Readers commonly wrote notes in the margins of books in order to enhance the understanding of later readers. Of the 52 extant manuscript copies of Lucretius&#x27; &quot;De rerum natura&quot; (On the Nature of Things) available to scholars, all but three contain marginal notes.

The practice of writing in the margins of books gradually declined over several centuries after the invention of the printing press. Printed books gradually became much less expensive, so they were no longer regarded as long-term assets to be improved for succeeding generations. The first Gutenberg Bible was printed in the 1450s. Hand annotations occur in most surviving books through the end of the 1500s. Marginalia did not become unusual until sometime in the 1800s.

Fermat&#x27;s claim, written around 1637, of a proof of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem too big to fit in the margin is the most famous mathematical marginal note. Voltaire, in the 1700s, annotated books in his library so extensively that his annotations have been collected and published. The first recorded use of the word &quot;marginalia&quot; is in 1819 in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. From 1845 to 1849 Edgar Allan Poe titled some of his reflections and fragmentary material &quot;Marginalia&quot;. Five volumes of Samuel T. Coleridge&#x27;s marginalia have been published. Beginning in the 1990s, attempts have been made to design and market e-book devices permitting a limited form of marginalia.

Some famous marginalia were serious works, or drafts thereof, written in margins due to scarcity of paper. Voltaire composed in book margins while in prison, and Sir Walter Raleigh wrote a personal statement in margins just before his execution. 
==Recent studies==
Marginalia can add to or detract from the value of an association copy of a book, depending on the author of the marginalia and on the book.

Catherine C. Marshall, doing research on the future of user interface design, has studied the phenomenon of user annotation of texts. She discovered that in several university departments, students would scour the piles of textbooks at used book dealers for consistently annotated copies. The students had a good appreciation for their predecessors&#x27; distillation of knowledge. In recent years, the marginalia left behind by university students as they engage with library textbooks has also been a topic of interest to sociologists looking to understand the experience of being a university student.

The former Moscow correspondent of &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, John Lloyd, has stated that he was shown Stalin&#x27;s copy of Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot;, with marginal comments.

American poet Billy Collins has explored the phenomenon of annotation within his poem titled &quot;Marginalia&quot;.

In the last thirty years or so, many efforts have been made to analyze and understand marginalia found within Illuminated manuscripts. However, multiple theories exist as to its function and meaning within context. One study on medieval and Renaissance manuscripts where snails are depicted on marginalia shows that these illustrations are a comic relief due to the similarity between the armor of knights and the shell of snails.Other studies of marginalia indicate it was used to provide additional commentary and support for surrounding text. Some types of marginalia may have also been a scribe’s form of artistic expression and skill while others were deliberate exaggerations to humor and entertain the reader. In addition, other marginalia may have existed as moral guides, providing bad examples of what behaviors should not be imitated. Lastly, some manuscript scholars believe medieval illuminators utilized marginalia due to fear of empty space left on pages or simply to supply a form of ornate meaningless distraction for the reader.Other examples of marginalia found within medieval manuscripts include drawings of centaurs, warrior women, battles between cats and mice, parables from biblical texts, personified foxes, rabbits, and monkeys, and hidden words and messages buried within border decorations.

It is related very closely to Inuktitut, and some scholars, such as Richard Condon, believe that Inuinnaqtun is more appropriately classified as a dialect of Inuktitut. The government of Nunavut recognises Inuinnaqtun as an official language in addition to Inuktitut, and together sometimes referred to as Inuktut. It is spoken in the Northwest Territories as well and is recognised as an official language of the territory in addition to Inuvialuktun and Inuktitut.

Inuinnaqtun is used primarily in the communities of Cambridge Bay, Kugluktuk and Gjoa Haven in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut. Outside Nunavut, it is spoken in the hamlet of Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, where it is also known as &quot;Kangiryuarmiutun&quot;, forming a part of Inuvialuktun. It is written using the Roman orthography except in Gjoa Haven, where Inuit syllabics are used (as for Natsilingmiutut).

<text>Gabriella Ferri (18 September 1942 – 3 April 2004) was an Italian singer born in Rome.

Ferri&#x27;s career began in a Milan nightclub in 1963. By 1965, she had broken into the Rome singing scene by singing popular Roman songs, thereby becoming an icon of Romanesco singing. One of her biggest hits was &quot;Sempre&quot; (&quot;Always&quot;). During her career, she also performed Neapolitan and Latin American pieces. During the 1970s, she starred in several popular TV shows. By the 1990s, however, she had largely left the spotlight.

She died in Corchiano, province of Viterbo, after falling from a third-floor balcony in an apparent suicide. Family members dispute this, saying she may have fallen ill after taking anti-depression medication and lost her balance.

<doc id="608951" wikidata="Q504143" url="?curid=608951" title="Renault 5">
<text>The Renault 5 is a five-passenger, three or five-door, front-engine, front-wheel drive hatchback supermini manufactured and marketed by the French automaker Renault over two generations: 1972–1985 (also called R5) and 1984–1996 (also called Super 5 or Supercinq).

The R5 was marketed in the United States and Canada as Le Car, from 1976 until 1983. Renault marketed a four-door sedan variant, the Renault 7, manufactured from 1974 until 1984 in Spain by Renault&#x27;s subsidiary FASA-Renault and exported to select markets.

The Renault 5 became the best-selling car in France from 1972 until 1986, with a total production exceeding 5.5 million over 14 years, making it France&#x27;s most popular car.

==First generation (1972–1985)==
The first images and details of the Renault 5 were published on 10 December 1971, and the car&#x27;s formal launch followed on 28 January 1972.

The Renault 5 was styled by Michel Boué, who designed the car in his spare time, outside of his regular duties. When Renault executives learned of Boué&#x27;s work, they were so impressed by his concept that they immediately authorized a formal development program. The R5 featured a steeply sloping rear hatchback. Boué had wanted the tail-lights to go all the way up from the bumper into the C-pillar, in the fashion of the much later Fiat Punto and Volvo 850 estate/wagon, but the lights remained at a more conventional level.

It was launched onto the right-hand drive U.K. market in the autumn of 1972, where alongside the recently launched Fiat 127 it competed as an imported but more modern alternative to British Leyland&#x27;s Mini and Chrysler Europe&#x27;s Hillman Imp — and without competitors from Ford or Vauxhall.

The Renault 5 narrowly missed out on the 1973 European Car of the Year award, which was instead given to the Audi 80.

Boué died of cancer at the end of 1972, just a few months after the car he designed was launched.

The R5 borrowed mechanicals from the successful Renault 4, using a longitudinally-mounted engine driving the front wheels with torsion bar suspension. OHV engines were the same as the Renault 4 and larger Renault 8. At the car&#x27;s launch, the 782 cc and 956 cc versions were available depending on the model level. A &quot;5TS/5LS&quot; with the 1,289 cc engine from the Renault 12 was added from April 1974. As on the Renault 4, entry-level Renault 5s had their engine sizes increased to 845 cc in 1976, and at the top of the range, later models included the 1,397 cc version.

It was one of the first modern superminis, which capitalized on the new hatchback layout which Renault had pioneered on its R16, launched in 1965. The R5 was launched a year after the initial, booted fastback version of the Fiat 127 (during the year, the 127 became available with a hatchback). The R5 was launched three years before the Volkswagen Polo and Vauxhall Chevette, and four years before the Ford Fiesta - new superminis which met the growing demand for this type of car in Western Europe. British Leyland was working on a new modern supermini during the 1970s, but the end product - the Austin Metro - was not launched until 1980. It was also introduced one year before the Toyota Starlet, while the Datsun 100A arrived in the UK starting in 1971. It was introduced six months before the Honda Civic, which appeared later in July.

Sales in Japan began in 1976, when both the two-door and four-door were available at Capital Car Dealerships. It was called the &quot;Renault Go&quot; because that is the Japanese word for &quot;five&quot;. While initially sold with North American spec emissions equipment, it was changed to a French emissions package. The car was initially sold as left-hand drive, then upgraded to right-hand drive.

Although the mechanical components came from earlier models, body construction involved floor sections welded together with the other body panels, resulting in a monocoque structure. The approach had by then become mainstream among many European automakers, but represented an advance on the mechanically similar Renault 4 and Renault 6, both of which used a separate platform. The monocoque structure reduced the car&#x27;s weight, but required investment in new production processes.

The Renault 5 was targeted at cost-conscious customers, and the entry-level &quot;L&quot; version included the same 782 cc engine as the Renault 4 and drum brakes on all four wheels. In 1972, it was priced in France at below 10,000 francs. However, for many export markets, the entry-level version was excluded from the range, and front-wheel disc brakes were offered on the more powerful 956 cc &quot;Renault 5TL&quot; along with features as an alternator and reclining backrests for the front seats. From outside, the &quot;TL&quot; was differentiated from the &quot;L&quot; by a thin chrome strip below the doors.

The early production R5 used a dashboard-mounted gearshift like the Renault 4. It was linked by a rod that ran over the top of the engine to a single bend where the rod turned downwards into the gearbox, which was positioned directly in front of the engine. A floor-mounted lever employing a cable linkage replaced this arrangement in 1973. An automatic version, with the larger 1,289 cc engine, was added in early 1978. At the time, automatic cars usually represented just under five percent of the Renault 5 production. Door handles were formed by a cut-out in the door panel and B-pillar. The R5 was one of the first cars produced with plastic (polyester and fiberglass) bumpers, which came from a specialist Renault factory at Dreux. These covered a larger area of potential contact than conventional car bumpers of the time and survived low-speed parking shunts without permanently distorting. This helped the car gain a reputation as an &quot;outstanding city car,&quot; and bumpers of this type subsequently became an industry standard.

The R5&#x27;s engine was set well back in the engine bay behind the gearbox. The passenger compartment &quot;is remarkably spacious&quot; compared to other modern, small European cars. The Renault 5 body&#x27;s drag coefficient was only 0.37 (with most European cars going up to 0.45).

Other versions of the first generation included the four-door saloon version called the Renault 7 built by FASA-Renault of Spain, where virtually all examples were sold. A five-door R5 was added to the range in 1979, making it one of the first cars of its size to feature four passenger doors. The three-speed automatic transmission model, which received equipment similar to the R5 GTL, but with a 1,289 cc engine rated at , a vinyl roof, and the TS&#x27; front seats, and also became available with five-door bodywork. In March 1981, the automatic received the 1.4 L engine that increased performance and fuel economy.

=== Renault 5 Alpine / Gordini / Copa===

The Renault 5 Alpine was one of the first &#x27;hot hatches&#x27; launched in 1976 – two months before the original Volkswagen Golf GTi. The right-hand drive 5 Alpine was shown at the British Motor Show in 1978, with sales from 4 April 1979 in the U.K. – but as the Renault 5 &quot;Gordini&quot;, because Chrysler Europe already had the rights to the name &quot;Alpine&quot; in the U.K. They had just used it on the Chrysler Alpine, the U.K. badged RHD Simca 1307, introduced at that time. It was months before the 1976 VW Golf GTi right-hand drive, which took Volkswagen three years to convert to RHD.

Use of the name Gordini came from Amédée Gordini, a French car tuner with links with Renault and previous sporting models, such as the Renault 8. Those cars and the Alpine Turbo models were assembled at Alpine&#x27;s Dieppe factory beginning in 1975. The U.K. launch price was £4,149 – nearly a third more than the previous top model, the 5 TS, at £3,187 – showing the considerable changes to the car, over the 5 TS, which could not reach , compared to the Gordini, which could reach .

The 1.4 L (1397 cc) OHV engine, mated to a five-speed gearbox, was based on the Renault &quot;Sierra&quot; pushrod engine, but having a crossflow cylinder head with hemispherical combustion chambers and developed , twice as much as a standard 1.1 L (1108 cc) Renault 5. The larger engine and its various performance parts meant that the spare wheel could no longer fit there and was relocated to the boot/trunk. The Alpine could be identified by special alloy wheels and front fog lights and was equipped with stiffened suspension, but still retaining the torsion bar at the rear with added anti-roll bars. Renault quoted a top speed of and tested in the July 1979 issue of UK magazine &quot;Car&quot;, it achieved a top speed of and 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 9.7 seconds. The UK car magazine &quot;Motor&quot; road test figures quoted top speed of and 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 9.7 seconds.

=== Renault 5 Alpine Turbo/Gordini Turbo/Copa Turbo===
The Renault 5 Alpine Turbo was launched in 1982 as an upgraded successor to the naturally aspirated Alpine. In Britain, the car was still called Gordini rather than Alpine. &quot;Motor&quot; magazine undertook a road test of the Turbo in 1982 and while they appreciated the performance (top speed , in 8.7 seconds), they were critical of its high price as it was £2 more than the larger Ford Escort XR3.

The 1.4 L (1,397 cc) engine in the Alpine/Gordini Turbo had a single Garrett T3 turbocharger, increasing the power output to . Sales continued until 1984 when the second generation Renault 5 was launched, and the release of the Renault 5 GT Turbo in 1985.
===Renault 5 Turbo===
The Renault 5 Turbo should not be confused with the Alpine Turbo or GT Turbo as it was radically modified by mounting a turbocharged engine behind the driver in what is usually the passenger compartment, creating a mid-engined rally car. It was also driven by the rear wheels rather than the front wheels. The Renault 5 Turbo was made in many guises, eventually culminating with the Renault 5 Maxi Turbo. With 8-valves, the 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-four Cléon-Fonte engine produced at 6000 rpm and maximum torque of at 3250 rpm.

=== Renault Le Car ===

Renault had about 250 dealerships in the United States. The North American Renault 5 debuted in 1976, but sales were disappointing, and many cars remained on dealer lots. Renault&#x27;s response was to change advertising agencies and rebrand the vehicle for the following year as &quot;Le Car.&quot; The new marketing campaign stressed the car&#x27;s sporty character and successful European competition history.

Renault formed an alliance in January 1979, allowing Renault cars to be sold and serviced by American Motors Corporation (AMC) dealers. The automaker marketed it through its 1,300 dealers, where it competed in the United States against such front-wheel-drive subcompacts as the Honda Civic and Volkswagen Rabbit. It was described as a &quot;French Rabbit&quot; that &quot;is low on style, but high on personality and practicality&quot;.

American Motors&#x27; ad agency launched the car in the U.S. with a marketing campaign emphasizing that it was Europe&#x27;s best-selling automobile with millions of satisfied owners. It did not achieve such immediate success in the United States market, even though the Le Car was praised in road tests comparing &quot;super-economy&quot; cars for its interior room and smooth ride, with an economical [ highway and city] as well as its smooth-running engine. Advertisements also focused on the Le Car&#x27;s standard features and low base price, actually comparing it to the imported Ford Fiesta, Honda Civic, and VW Rabbit.

The U.S. version featured a 1289 cc inline-four engine rated at . In 1977, it dominated the Sports Car Club of America &quot;Showroom Stock Class C&quot; class. Ever tightening emissions legislation meant that power was down to by 1980.

The Le Car was offered in three-door hatchback form only from 1976 until 1980. For the 1980 model year, the front end was updated to include a redesigned bumper, grille, and rectangular headlights. A five-door hatchback body style was added in the 1981 model year. Sales increased each year, from 6,800 in 1976 to 37,000 in 1982. Although the Le Car did not see popularity in the U.S., it sold reasonably well in Canada. Imports from France continued through 1983, when the car was replaced by the Kenosha, Wisconsin—built Renault 11-based Renault Alliance. Sales in Canada continued until 1986, two years after the second generation Renault 5 (known as the &quot;Supercinq&quot; or &quot;Superfive&quot;) had replaced it in the European market. Despite the &#x27;Le Car&#x27; brand being created specifically for the North American market, Renault later applied the name to special edition versions of the Renault 5 in Europe from 1979 onward.

The Le Car was used as a law enforcement vehicle. The La Conner, Washington, police department acquired three of the vehicles for its fleet in the late-1970s. Because they were early adopters, Renault advertised Le Car&#x27;s versatility in a full-page ad illustrating its use by the department. The chief of police, Russ Anderson, was quoted &quot;Gas is killing us. With Le Car, we were able to decrease our budget and increase our mobility.&quot; Another small town, Ogunquit, Maine, used five Renault 5s as their police cars in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Heuliez built and sold van conversions as Le Car Van. The rear side panels were replaced with plastic panels incorporating a round porthole window and a new liftgate featuring a smaller window. The interior was red velour. It was available both in two- and four-seat versions. Between 1979 and 1983, about 450 Le Car Vans were built.
U.S. Electricar, based in Athol, Massachusetts, performed electric vehicle conversions on the Renault Le Car, installing sixteen six-volt lead-acid batteries, providing a modest range of . In 1978, the converted cars were rebranded &quot;Lectric Leopard&quot; and marketed to government agencies.

===Motorsport===

The Renault 5 Alpine version was raced in Group 2. In the 1978 Monte Carlo, Renault 5 Alpines came second and third overall, despite a powerful team entry from Fiat and Lancia.

In 1978, a rally Group 4 (later Group B) version was introduced. It was named the Renault 5 Turbo, but being mid-engined and rear-wheel drive, this car had little technical resemblance to the road-going version. Though retaining the shape and general look of the 5, only the door panels were shared with the standard version. Driven by Jean Ragnotti, this car won the 1981 Monte Carlo Rally for its first race. The 2WD R5 turbo soon faced competition from new 4WD vehicles that were faster on dirt; however, the Renault remained among the fastest of its era on paved roads.

===Production elsewhere===
;Iran
The original Renault 5 continued to be produced in Iran by SAIPA, then by Pars Khodro (a SAIPA subsidiary), as the Sepand. In 2001, the Renault PK went on sale: for this version, the Sepand&#x27;s Renault 5 platform was replaced with that of a Kia Pride, while a modified version of the Renault 5&#x27;s bodywork was kept. The Sepand II, restyled in 2000, was kept in production with the original Renault underpinnings for a little while longer as a lower-cost alternative.

;South Africa
Assembly in South Africa began in late 1975, in Durban. The car was built in Toyota&#x27;s local plant and sold through their network. The Renault 5 was only available with one engine, the 1.3 L unit used in the European R5 TS rated at SAE. There was a base model, with vinyl seats and lap belts only, and the upmarket LS and LSS models. These received fabric interiors, side stripes, a vinyl roof, more sound deadening, and other comfort details. The LSS also included a central console and a full-length fabric sunroof. Many extras used in Europe, such as a rear window wiper and a tachometer, were unavailable in South Africa because it would make it impossible to meet local content regulations. Local content was 56% at introduction; this was to be increased steadily as production wore on.

By 1979, the lineup was restricted to the GTL and the TS, both still with the 1289 cc engine but now with ISO respectively.

;Yugoslavia
IMV from Novo Mesto, SR Slovenia, built several Renault models since 1972, including the Renault 5 for the Yugoslav market.

== Second generation (1984–1996)==
The second generation R5, marketed as the &quot;Renault 5&quot; (or Supercinq, Superfive), launched in October 1984 — within 18 months of Ford, General Motors, Peugeot, Fiat and Nissan launching competitors in the supermini sector. Initially, It was only available with a three-door body, leading to a somewhat slow introduction. Right-hand drive models for the UK market were launched in January 1985.

Although it closely resembled the first generation car, the bodyshell and platform were completely new (the platform was based on that of the bigger Renault 9 and 11 models); the styling was by Marcello Gandini. The new body was wider and longer with 20 percent more glass area, more interior space, and a lower drag coefficient of (0.35), as well as at in the economy models. The most significant changes were the adoption of a transversely-mounted powertrain from the 9 and 11 and MacPherson strut front suspension. The five-door version arrived in May 1985.

The second generation launched in four trim levels: TC, TL, GTL, and Automatic. The entry-level TC had the 956 cc engine of ((, while the TL had the 1108 cc engine of (, and the GTL, Automatic, TS and TSE had the 1397 cc engine (rated at for the GTL, for the Automatic, and for the TS and TSE). The TC and TL had four-speed manual gearboxes, while the GTL, TS, and TSE had five-speed manual gearboxes (optional on the TL), and the Automatic had a three-speed automatic gearbox. 1987 saw the introduction of the 1721 cc F2N engine in the GTX, GTE (F3N), and in July also in the luxurious Baccara . The Baccara was sold as the Monaco in the United Kingdom, as the &quot;Exclusiv&quot; in Germany, and as the &quot;Limited&quot; in Italy. Italian buyers also had the option of the 1.4 engine in the top version, whereas only the 1.7 was available elsewhere. Diesel versions arrived in November 1985, mostly completing the range.

It was planned to market the vehicle as a downsized successor, substituting the AMC Pacer in the United States, which affected the design of the R5. Within the alliance of Renault and the American Motors Corporation, only its predecessor was marketed in the U.S.

Renault used the naturally aspirated 1.7 L from the Renault 9/11, with multipoint fuel injection, in addition to the sports-orientated 1.4 L turbo. Under the name GTE, it produced with a catalytic converter. Although not as fast as the turbo model, it featured the same interior and exterior sports appearance, as well as identical suspension and brakes. The Baccara and GTX versions used the 1.7 engine - with the GTX featuring a full leather interior, power steering, electric windows, sunroof, high-specification audio equipment, with available air-conditioning and an onboard computer. The latter was effectively the same, but the leather interior was an option and there were other detail changes. As with the previous generation, the 5 Turbo was again assembled at the Alpine plant in Dieppe, where forty cars per day were constructed in 1985.

In 1990, the R5 was effectively replaced by the Clio, which was a sales success across Europe. Production of the R5 was transferred to the Revoz factory in Yugoslavia (since 1992 called Slovenia) when the Clio was launched. It remained on sale with only the 1.1 L, 1.4 L petrol, and 1.6 L naturally aspirated diesel engines.

The GT Turbo, with its turbocharged 1.4 engine and a top speed of more than , was discontinued in 1991 on the launch of the Clio 16-valve.

A new 1.4 L engine with a catalytic converter engine used in the Clio was introduced during December 1992, which also marked the end of the R5 Diesel (retail market commercial fleet models kept this option). The most common variant available after the Clio had been introduced as a minimally equipped model named the R5 Campus until the car&#x27;s 12-year production ended in 1996. It also marked the end of the R5 designation after nearly 25 years and the discontinuation of numerical model designations for Renault cars that had been used for much of the company&#x27;s history.

The Campus sold more strongly in the United Kingdom than elsewhere, because the Renault Twingo (which addressed the same market) was only sold in LHD and exclusively in mainland Europe. In 2011, it was recommended as one of &quot;Britain&#x27;s best bangers&quot;, by &quot;Car Mechanics Magazine&quot; because of the number of inexpensive, low mileage, full-service history, and used cars on the market. The Campus name was revived in 2005 with the Renault Clio II.

===Renault 5 GT Turbo===
A &quot;hot hatch&quot; version, the GT Turbo, was introduced in February 1985. It used a modified four-cylinder, eight-valve Cléon 1397 cc engine, a pushrod unit dating back to the 1962 original (in 1108 cc form). It was turbocharged with an air-cooled Garrett T2 turbocharger. Weighing a mere , and producing , the GT Turbo had an excellent power-to-weight ratio, permitting it to accelerate from a standstill to in 7.5 seconds.

It came with plastic side skirts to differentiate it from the standard 5. Turbo lag was an issue, along with poor hot starting, and was considered rather difficult to control. The same engine was used in the Renault 9 and 11 Turbos. The regular fuel tank was considered too small for the Turbo, and a supplementary tank was installed at the rear left of the car, and the 5 GT Turbo also received an oil cooler. Suspension upgrades also meant that the ride height was lowered by in front while a new rear &quot;four-bar&quot; suspension, with a wider track, lowered the rear of the car by . The car&#x27;s steering, at 3 turns from lock to lock, was also faster than the regular cars. Disc brakes on all four wheels with ventilated rotors on the front. The aerodynamic 5.5-inch wide aluminium wheels were similar to those of the Renault Alpine V6 GT.

In 1987, the facelifted Phase II was launched. Major changes in the Phase II version included installing watercooling to the turbocharger, aiding the Phase I&#x27;s oil-cooled setup, which extended the life of the turbo. It also received a new ignition system which permitted it to rev 500 rpm higher. These changes boosted engine output to over . Externally, the car was revamped, with changes (including new bumpers and arches) that reduced the car&#x27;s drag coefficient from 0.36 to 0.35—giving Phase II a 0–100 km/h time of 7.5 seconds. In 1989 the GT Turbo received a new interior, and in 1990 the special edition Raider model (available only in metallic blue, with different interior and wheels) was launched. In late 1991, the Renault 5 GT Turbo was discontinued and superseded by the Clio 16V and the Clio Williams.

The Renault 5 GT Turbo&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Rallye Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot; victory remains the only overall WRC victory for a Group N car.

;WRC victories

Roger Saunders and Alex Postan took part in the 1987 British Touring Car Championship season using a 5 GT Turbo.

===Renault Express===

The second-generation R5 also included a panel van version known as the Renault Express. It was commercialized in some European countries, such as the Renault Extra (the UK and Ireland) or Renault Rapid (mainly German speaking countries). This car was intended to replace the R4 F6 panel van, which had ceased production in 1986.

===EBS convertible===

In 1989, the Belgian company EBS produced convertible versions of the Renault 5 (1,400 in total), almost all of which were left-hand drive. A total of 14 of the 1,400 cars produced were based on the right-hand drive GT Turbo Phase II.

==Revival==
The Renault 5 nameplate returned in February 2024 as an electric-powered hatchback bearing design cues inspired by the original design and the Renault 5 Turbo. An Alpine version is said to be in development as well. 
The Renault 5 E-tech has won the European Car of the Year award in 2025.
==Production==
Overall production of the Renault 5 and all its variants: 9,017,276 units, comprising:

<text>Sertoli cells are a type of sustentacular &quot;nurse&quot; cell found in human testes which contribute to the process of spermatogenesis (the production of sperm) as a structural component of the seminiferous tubules. They are activated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secreted by the adenohypophysis and express FSH receptor on their membranes.

==History==
Sertoli cells are named after Enrico Sertoli, an Italian physiologist who discovered them while studying medicine at the University of Pavia, Italy. He published a description of his eponymous cell in 1865. The cell was discovered by Sertoli with a Belthle microscope which had been purchased in 1862. In the 1865 publication, his first description used the terms &quot;tree-like cell&quot; or &quot;stringy cell&quot;; most importantly, he referred to these as &quot;mother cells&quot;. Other scientists later used Enrico&#x27;s family name to label these cells in publications, beginning in 1888. As of 2006, two textbooks that are devoted specifically to the Sertoli cell have been published.

==Structure==
Sertoli cells are specifically located in the convolutions of the seminiferous tubules, since this is the only place in the testes where spermatozoa are produced. As the primary support cell of the tubules, they are generally very large and amorphous, with individual cells stretching from the basal lamina to the lumen; their cytoplasm often completely surrounds the germline cells which they are responsible for nursing. Sertoli cells are easily confused with the other cells of the germinal epithelium when using standard staining techniques; the most distinctive feature of the Sertoli cell is its dark nucleolus.

==Development==
Sertoli cells are required for male sexual development. Sertoli cell proliferation and differentiation is mainly activated by FGF9, with which they also form a feedforward loop. It has been suggested that Sertoli cells may derive from the fetal mesonephros. After puberty, Sertoli cells begin to elongate. Their nucleoli become larger and tight junctions are completed, creating a fluid-filled lumen space.

FSH is responsible for controlling the proliferation of Sertoli cells shortly after birth and stimulates the production of factors derived from Sertoli cells that control the development of the testes and germ cells. FSH, luteinizing hormone. thyroid-stimulating hormone, and hCG are all known to affect Sertoli cell development and male reproductive health. FSH is required for Sertoli cell mitogen, which stimulates the expression of various cell markers.

Once fully differentiated, the Sertoli cell is considered terminally differentiated, and is unable to proliferate. Therefore, once spermatogenesis has begun, no more Sertoli cells are created, and their population within the seminiferous tubules is finite.

Recently, however, scientists have found a way to induce Sertoli cells to a juvenile proliferative phenotype outside of the body. This gives rise to the possibility of repairing some defects of testicular niche cells which may cause male infertility.

==Function==
Because its main function is to nourish developing sperm cells through the stages of spermatogenesis, the Sertoli cell has also been called the &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;nurse&quot; cell. Sertoli cells also act as phagocytes, consuming the residual cytoplasm during spermatogenesis. Translocation of cells from the basal lamina to the lumen of the seminiferous tubules occurs by conformational changes in the lateral margins of the Sertoli cells.

===Secretory===
Sertoli cells secrete the following substances:
* anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), secreted during the early stages of fetal life
* inhibin and activins, secreted after puberty, work together to regulate FSH secretion
* androgen-binding protein (also called testosterone-binding globulin) increases testosterone concentration in the seminiferous tubules to lightly stimulate spermatogenesis
* estradiol - an aromatase converts testosterone to 1,7-beta-estradiol to direct spermatogenesis
* ETS Related Molecule or ERM transcription factor is needed for maintenance of the spermatogonial stem cells in the adult testis
* transferrin, a blood plasma protein for iron ion delivery
* testicular ceruloplasmin, a ceruloplasmin-like protein which is immunologically similar to serum ceruloplasmin.

===Structural===
The occluding junctions of Sertoli cells form the blood–testis barrier, a structure that partitions the interstitial blood compartment of the testis from the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous tubules. Because of the apical progression of the spermatogonia, the occluding junctions must be dynamically reformed and broken to allow the immunoidentical spermatogonia to cross through the blood-testis barrier so that they can become immunologically unique. Sertoli cells control the entry and exit of nutrients, hormones, and other chemicals into the tubules of the testis as well as make the adluminal compartment an immune-privileged site.

Sertoli cells are also responsible for establishing and maintaining the spermatogonial stem cell niche, which ensures the renewal of stem cells and the differentiation of spermatogonia into mature germ cells that progress stepwise through the long process of spermatogenesis, ending in the release of spermatozoa in a process known as spermiation. Sertoli cells bind to spermatogonial cells via N-cadherins and galactosyltransferase (via carbohydrate residues).

===Other functions===
During spermatogenesis, Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the spermatogonia.

Sertoli cells are capable of repairing DNA damage. This repair likely employs the process of non-homologous end joining involving XRCC1 and PARP1 proteins that are expressed in Sertoli cells.

Sertoli cells have a higher mutation frequency than spermatogenic cells. Compared to spermatocytes, the mutation frequency is about 5 to 10-fold higher in Sertoli cells. This may reflect the need for greater efficiency of DNA repair and mutation avoidance in the germ line than in somatic cells.

=== Immunomodulatory properties of Sertoli cells ===
Besides expressing factors that are crucial for sperm cell maturation, Sertoli cells also produce a wide range of molecules (either on their surface or soluble) that are able to modify the immune system. The ability of Sertoli cells to change the immune response in the tubule is needed for successful sperm cell maturation. Sperm cells express neo-epitopes on their surface as they progress through different stages of maturation, which can trigger a strong immune response if placed in a different part of the body.

==== Molecules produced by Sertoli cells associated with immunosuppression or immunoregulation ====
FAS/FAS-L system – expression of Fas ligand (Fas-L) on the surface of SCs activates apoptotic death of Fas receptor-bearing cells, e.g. cytotoxic T cells.

- soluble FasL: increasing the effectivity of the system

- soluble Fas: FasL blockage on the surface of other cells (no apoptotic induction in Sertoli cells by immune cells)

B7/H1 – decreasing proliferation of effector T-cells

Jagged1 (JAG1) – induction of Foxp3 transcription factor expression in naive T lymphocytes (increasing relative numbers of T regulatory cells)

Protease inhibitor-9 (PI-9) – member of serpin family (serine protease inhibitors), which induces secretion of protease Granzyme B, cytotoxic T-cells and NK cells are able to induce apoptosis in target cell. SCs produce PI-9 that irreversibly bonds Granzyme B and inhibits its activity.

CD59, a surface molecule on SCs and a member of the complement regulatory proteins (CRP), inhibits the last step of the complement cascade, the formation of the membrane attack complex.

Clusterin, a soluble molecule with functions similar to CD59, forms a complex with Granzyme B and inhibits activation of apoptosis by T-lymphocytes or NK cells.

TGF-beta, a transforming growth factor beta (its direct production by SCs is controversial), contributes to the induction of regulatory T-cells on the periphery.

==== Other molecules ====
CD40, a molecule associated with dendritic cells (DCs). SCs are able to down regulate the expression of CD40 on the surface of DCs, by an unknown mechanism. Downregulation of CD40 results in the decreased ability of DCs to stimulate the T-cell response.

Sertoli cells are also able to inhibit the migration of immune cells by lowering immune cell infiltration to the site of inflammation.

==Clinical significance==
Sertoli–Leydig cell tumour is part of the sex cord-stromal tumour group of ovarian neoplasms. These tumors produce both Sertoli and Leydig cells and lead to an increased secretion of testosterone in ovaries and testicles.

==Other animals==

The function of Sertoli cells in the Amniota and Anamniota is the same, but they have slightly different properties when compared to each other. Anamnionts (fish and amphibians) employ cystic spermatogenesis in order to produce sperm cells. In the Amniota, Sertoli cells are terminally differentiated cells which are normally incapable of proliferating. In the Anamniota, Sertoli cells go through two proliferative phases. The first phase of proliferation occurs during cyst establishment, promoting the migration of germ cells into it. The second phase involves enlargement of the cyst which produces space for the proliferating germ cells.

The once commonly accepted fact that Sertoli cells are unable to divide and proliferate in Amniota has recently been challenged. Upon xenogenic transplantation, Sertoli cells have been shown to regain the ability to proliferate.

==Research==
Recently (2016), experimental models of autoimmune inflammatory disorders, including diabetes, have prompted the implication of Sertoli cells into cell therapy transplantation thanks to their immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.

Research into adapting Sertoli cells for use in the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus involves the strategy of cotransplanting β cells together with Sertoli cells into the recipient organism. In mice, rats, and humans, the presence of these cells restored glucose homeostasis as well as lowered requirements for external insulin. In all cases no immunosuppression was used, and the role of this medication was taken and provided by SC.

By treating spontaneously diabetic and obese mice with the transplantation of microencapsulated Sertoli cells in subcutaneous abdominal fat deposits, Giovanni &quot;et al.&quot; demonstrated that more than half of the treated mice showed improved glucose homeostasis. This recent scientific work promises a future better treatment to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus through the use of cell therapy.

Sertoli cells promote skin graft acceptance by the recipient organism and their presence also helps to increase the numbers of motor neurons in the spinal cord of SOD1 mice (a mouse model used in the study of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).

<doc id="608962" wikidata="Q5574055" url="?curid=608962" title="Winston Hill">
<text>Winston Cordell Hill (October 23, 1941 – April 26, 2016) was an American professional football offensive tackle who played in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL), primarily with the New York Jets. He played college football for the Texas Southern Tigers.

==Early life and college==
Hill grew up in Joaquin, Texas. His father, Garfield Hill, served as principal of Weldon High School in Gladewater, Texas. Winston was a tennis champion in high school. He played both offensive and defensive line in college at Texas Southern University and was an All-American.

==Professional career==
Hill was drafted by the Baltimore Colts in 1963, but signed as a free agent with New York&#x27;s American Football League franchise in the same year that they became the New York Jets, and went on to record the tenth-longest string of starts in pro football history at 174. As left offensive tackle for the Jets, he spent his career protecting Joe Namath&#x27;s blind side and opening holes for the likes of Emerson Boozer, Matt Snell and John Riggins. He was an American Football League All-Star in 1964, 1967, 1968 and 1969, and a Pro Bowl selection in 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973. He and Joe Namath joined the Los Angeles Rams in 1977; Namath retired after one season and Hill after three games. On January 15, 2020, Hill was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2020, and is in the Class of 2021 for the Black College Football Hall of Fame.

===1968 season and Super Bowl III===

Hill was an overpowering blocker who was instrumental in opening gaping holes for Jet running backs during the 1968 season, in which they won the Eastern division title with 11 wins and 3 losses and gained as a team 1608 yards rushing and 3574 yards passing. Hill also starred in the Third Professional AFL-NFL World Championship Game (Super Bowl III), as the Jets decimated the right side of the Baltimore Colts&#x27; defensive line with Ordell Braase at end against Hill and Fred Miller at tackle against Bob Talamini, so that Matt Snell gained 121 yards rushing in the Jets&#x27; 16–7 upset victory.

==Special recognition==
In 1970 Hill was selected by a panel of members of the AFL&#x27;s Hall of Fame Board of Selectors to the second-team All-time All-American Football League Team. He was a member of the New York Jets&#x27; All-Time Four Decade Team, which was determined by the fans in 2003. Hill was a 1986 inductee into the Texas Southern University Sports Hall of Fame.

The 2009 NFL season was the 50th season for the eight original AFL teams, and that anniversary was commemorated throughout the season with 16 &quot;AFL Legacy Games.&quot; One of those games, pitting the NY Jets against the Miami Dolphins, took place in New York on Sunday November 1; designated by the NFL as &quot;Winston Hill Day&quot;. Hill&#x27;s daughter, opera singer Heather Hill, opened the game by singing the national anthem, and fifteen of Hill&#x27;s former teammates and other ex-Jets joined the festivities. As part of the celebration, Hill&#x27;s jersey, #75, was retired during the halftime ceremonies.

On Monday August 16, 2010, during halftime of the first game played at the New Meadowlands Stadium (a preseason opener; Jets vs. Giants), Hill was inducted into the Jets Ring of Honor. This selection was made by an internal committee led by Jets Chairman and CEO Woody Johnson.

On January 15, 2020, Hill was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2020. The following year he was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta, GA over the Juneteenth weekend. The BCHOF has a permanent residence in Canton, OH. Hill will be honored posthumously over Labor Day weekend in Canton, OH.

==Later life==
Hill was a 46-year Colorado resident. During that time he became known for his generous nature and philanthropic community based activities. He was an ardent supporter of youth programs and brought campers to the Joe Namath, John Dockery football camp until he was no longer able to travel. He collaborated with fellow athletes and was often the only non Bronco invited to Bronco parties when he was in town.

Hill worked with the Gilliam Youth Center in Denver and was a major supporter of restorative justice. He volunteered for years at the Denver Indian Center and got fellow pro athletes, Broncos and Nuggets to donate sporting equipment and to volunteer time at youth camps. He was a motivational speaker for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and spoke nationally for twenty years.

Concerning the NFL, Hill was an active member of the Alumni Players Association and was an insistent advocate in two areas: Financial education for players and health care equal to the needs of retired football players, many who suffered from injuries sustained during years as a player. Financially, he had great concern surrounding young players coming in and receiving massive salaries without the information and wisdom needed to negotiate or handle their income responsibly. His most pressing passion was advocating for player&#x27;s health. Prior to and during the years that concussive brain syndrome was coming into the spotlight, Hill had annually discussed the need for better healthcare provisions for retired players. Players, especially the older ones, whose careers preceded the super salaries of today, often did not have the funds nor the means to travel to their home team headquarters to request support with their increasing health concerns. The year after Hill died, 2017 at the annual Jets Alumni meeting held at the Atlantic Health Training Center, leadership discussed the changes that were in place and detailed a list of supports to answer the call for proper medical treatment. Daughter Heather Hill stated, &quot;Winston went to the mountain top, but was not able to cross over. Still, his persistence was a voice of change and action that has brought us to this day.&quot;
Hill opened his first barbecue restaurant in 1980 after apprenticing under the legendary Five Points community leader, Daddy Bruce Randolph. Over the years he became involved in several restaurant ventures but his favorite location was a little take out his family still runs to this day.
Hill brought a smoker and his cooking talents to Centennial, Colorado, in the early 1990s and opened Winston Hill&#x27;s BBQ or Winston Hill&#x27;s Ribs &amp; Stuff; now called Winston&#x27;s Smoke BBQ. As of February 2023, the location has since closed permanently.

His daughters, Heather Hill, singer/actress and Hovlyn May, educator, began the Winston Hill Finish Like a Pro Athletic Endowed Scholarship at Texas Southern University aimed at juniors and seniors needing help to finish &quot;like pros&quot; in the fields of physical education, sports medicine, physical therapy, neurological sciences.

==Death==
Hill died on April 26, 2016, at the age of 74. He died of congestive heart failure and concussive brain syndrome. At his request his brain was donated to science to further the research on brain injuries suffered by athletes.

<doc id="608963" wikidata="Q1130825" url="?curid=608963" title="Renault 9 and 11">
<text>The Renault 9 and Renault 11 are small family cars produced by the French manufacturer Renault from 1981 to 1989 in saloon (Renault 9) and hatchback (Renault 11) configurations — both were styled by the French automobile designer, Robert Opron.

Variants were manufactured by American Motors Corporation (AMC), as the Renault Alliance and Renault Encore for the North American market. The car was produced in Turkey until 2000.

The models use a transverse front-wheel drive engine configuration, and feature four wheel independent suspension. They were chosen as the European Car of the Year in 1982, as well as the Car of the Year by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; and one of the 10Best by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; in 1983.

== Phases ==
There were three facelifts given to the Renault 9 and two facelifts to the Renault 11 during their careers. When released in 1983, the Renault 11 was equipped with double headlights, different from the Renault 9. In 1985 the Renault 9 was given a facelift, giving it the same front look and double headlights as the Renault 11 but only in GTS, GTD, TSE, TDE, TXE, and GTX levels. The lower end C, TC, GTC, TL, GTL, and TD models retained the phase 1 front. The later Renault 9 Broadway series also had the 4 headlight front of the phase 1 Renault 11. The more aerodynamic Phase 2 appeared in 1987 and the 9 and 11 now only differed at the rear of the cars.

Finally, the Phase 3, which was not sold in most of Europe, was released in Turkey in 1997. This final revision had more rounded head and tail lights, as well as ovoid body cladding around the bumpers and boot lid, which aimed to give the car a more modern look. The front design was originally developed for the 1993 facelift model assembled in Taiwan under the name &quot;Renault Luxmore.&quot; These later Turkish-made cars carried a &quot;Broadway&quot; badge as well as the Renault 9 designation, but note that &quot;Broadway&quot; had already been used on special editions of the earlier phase models.

== Overview ==
The Renault 9 was launched in October 1981 as a four-door saloon (in right-hand drive form for the UK market in March 1982), while the &quot;11&quot; was launched at the beginning of 1983 (in the UK from June that year) as a three or five door hatchback.

Both had been developed under the Renault code name &quot;L42&quot;, and were designed by Robert Opron. Renault had begun the conception of the Renault 9 in 1977, as a &quot;four metre&quot; model (referring to its length) to fit between the Renault 5 and the Renault 14.

Opron conceived a traditional three box design to appeal to the traditional customer and avoid the poor reception that had met the Renault 14&#x27;s styling. Exhaustive consumer studies suggested that buyers rejected innovation, resulting in a rather nondescript design, albeit of modest elegance. The roofline was also taller than many competitors, to provide ample interior space. The 9 went on sale in the United Kingdom in March 1982 in 1.1-litre C and TC, the TL, GTL, and TLE received the 1.4-litre with , and the GTS and TSE received a derivative of the same.

By the time the models entered production, Renault had assigned more than 500 people to the project, logging 14,500,000 hours of study and testing, constructing 44 prototypes, testing 130 engines, and test driving prototypes more than 2.2 million km.
Both cars were also more conservatively engineered, although they retained front wheel drive, Renault abandoned the Douvrin (or &quot;Suitcase&quot;) transmission in sump engine which it had shared with Peugeot-Citroën in the Renault 14, in favour of its in-house power unit – the venerable C-type &quot;Cléon&quot; engine with an end on mounted transmission. This mechanical layout, along with the 9/11&#x27;s suspension design, was to become the basis of all small Renaults for the next 15 years or so.

The Renault 9 was awarded the 1982 European Car of the Year, while the Alliance appeared on &quot;Car and Driver&#x27;s&quot; Ten Best list for 1983, and was the 1983 &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year. The well-equipped Renault 11 TSE Electronic of 1983 was the first car in its class to have a synthetically voiced trip computer, but only because Renault moved up its launch date by a few days in order to get ahead of Austin&#x27;s Maestro Vanden Plas.

Although the 9 and 11 cars had different names and body styles, they were identical under the skin, and were intended to jointly replace the older Renault 14. The 11 was also distinguishable from the 9 by its front end, which featured square twin headlights, which had been introduced on the North American &quot;Alliance&quot;. The 9 also received this new front end in late 1985 for the 1986 model year. 

The 11 deliberately aped the styling of its larger brother launched almost at the same time - the executive Renault 25 (also styled by Robert Opron) - featuring the signature wraparound rear window and the dramatic hooded dashboard design, which had the option of an &#x27;Electronique&#x27; trim level which featured a digital instrument cluster and a voice synthesis trip computer - similar to those on the 25. The 9, by contrast had a simpler and more conservative looking dashboard and the digital instruments were never available. Both models were facelifted one more time for the European market (Phase 2) with matching nose and interior upgrades for the model year of 1987. At the Brussels Motor Show in January 1985 Renault showed the 11 Société, a light commercial version of the three-door hatchback with a cargo platform replacing the rear seat.

A version of the &quot;9&quot; was manufactured and marketed by American Motors Corporation (AMC) in the United States as the Renault Alliance and bearing a small AMC badge. With 623,573 examples manufactured for model years 1982–1987, AMC offered the Alliance as a four-door sedan, two door sedan (with higher rear wheel arches than the four door) and as a convertible, beginning in 1984.

The Renault 9 and 11 continued in production in France until 1989, a year after the launch of the Renault 19. However, production continued in other countries, with the end finally coming after nearly twenty years when production in Turkey was discontinued in 2000.

=== Competition ===
The Renault 11 Turbo was used extensively by Renault Sport for their Group A car in the 1987 World Rally Championship. Frenchman Alain Oreille managed a Group N victory in the 1985 Rallye Monte Carlo, followed by the Group A victory in 1986 (enough for an eighth finish overall). A Renault 11 Turbo was, however, piloted to a second and third-place finishes in the 1987 Portuguese Rally and San Remo Rally respectively with Jean Ragnotti in the driver&#x27;s seat. The 11 Turbo also won the national Polish Rally Championship in 1985 and 1988, and both the Swiss and Portuguese rally championships in 1987. Its last result of importance was Oreille&#x27;s fourth place overall in the 1988 Rallye Monte Carlo.

== Engines ==

At launch, both cars used Renault&#x27;s ageing Cléon-Fonte overhead valve engines in either 1.1  or 1.4 litre format, and a basic suspension design which won few plaudits for the driving experience. The exceptions were the 9 Turbo and the 11 Turbo hot hatch, which used the turbocharged engine from the Renault 5.

The C1E 1.1 liters engine was available only on the Renault 9 and for the three-door body of the R11. The five-door Renault 11 TC and GTC became available with the C1G, 1.2-litre engine in 1985. The C1E was phased out from phase 2, leaving the C1G the smallest engine for the 9/11.

The 11 Turbo was introduced first, originally only with three-door bodywork. Compared to the 5 Turbo and the 205 GTi, the 11 Turbo had a more comfort oriented focus. Although the cars were heavier than the Renault 5, the increased power in later models was enough to ensure higher performance, thanks to its . The rally tuned version was impressively fast, producing up to .

The newer F type engine which had been developed in collaboration with Volvo appeared from the end of 1983 on in twin carburetted 1,721 cc guise (F2N), powering the upmarket GTX, GTE, TXE, and TXE Electronic (Electronique in France) versions. These larger engined versions were specifically developed with American needs in mind, although they also happened to be well suited for a changing European market.

Later iterations also received fuel injected engines. The Alliance and Encore, while comparatively underpowered, had a definite advantage in ride and handling against other small cars available in America at the time and even had their own SCCA spec racing series, the Alliance Cup.

== Different versions around the world ==

=== Argentina ===

The Renault 11 was manufactured between October 1984 and December 1994 in Renault Argentina&#x27;s Santa Isabel plant with the following trim levels: GTL, RL, RN, TR, TS, TSE, TXE with the 1.4 M1400 engine by Renault Argentina and after by CIADEA. Manufacture of the Renault 9 began in 1987 until 1997 in the same versions and engines, plus the 1.6 like the R11 and according to ADEFA 144,262 vehicles made (R9) and 79,037 (R11). Today, the R9 is a very popular car in the country, like in the small and the big cities.

All versions of the R11 and R9 manufactured in Argentina, as well as in Colombia and Turkey, suffered the problems that the material with which the dashboard is made degraded with ultraviolet rays, and ends cracking (especially on the right side, since it doesn&#x27;t have the steering column that supports it).

=== Colombia ===
SOFASA started manufacturing the Renault 9 in 1983, launching the version GTL with 1400 cc and . This model&#x27;s engine capacity was reduced to 1300 cc and became the entry model when the better equipped GTS (1400 cc) was launched in 1985.

The next European facelifted versions of the Renault 9 in the country were known as the Gama 2. In 1987, the TL (1300 cc) was introduced followed by the more advanced TSE 1.3 and GTX 1.4 in 1988. The latter featured front power windows, a spoiler, and a better interior. The new top of the range TXE was launched in 1989, and introduced updated front lights, power mirrors and the TIR – An infrared remote control to operate the locks. In 1990, SOFASA marketed a 50 vehicle, 50th special edition Prestige with leather seats and alloy rims.

In 1992, these versions ceased production and three models were introduced: The basic Brío (1.3 L), the mid range Súper (1.3 L) and the Máximo (1.6 L). In 1995, the Brío was renamed Brío RN, so it could be differentiated from the more sophisticated Brío RT. A more powerful variant of the RT was called Óptimo.

By the middle of 1996, SOFASA decided to experiment a much more flexible way to offer cars to the market. Called R9 Personnalité, the idea allowed customers to choose from different engines and accessories so they could assemble the car they wanted within their budget. This was possible through special software in dealerships. A year later, a facelifted version featured fuel injection, assisted steering, and a completely new interior.

After 16 years of production, the Renault 9 was discontinued in Colombia, and was replaced by the Renault 19 and the Renault Mégane. It became the quintessential family car in Colombia, reaching over 115,000 units built and sold between 1983 and 1999, a record in the automotive Colombian history up to that time.

=== Taiwan===
Sanfu Motors in Taiwan assembled the Renault 9 from 1983 until 1996. An automatic-equipped version became available in January 1985. In 1985 the five-door Renault 11 also became available, initially only in sporting GTX trim with alloy wheels and equipped with the F2NA engine with . As of April 1986 the Renault 9 gained the twin headlight front design of the 11, while the 11 GTX was replaced by the TXE. From October 1986 the 1397 cc engine originally reserved for the R9 was also made available in the R11 GTS, eroding its position as a sportier model, while the 1.7-liter R9 TXE was also added. In September 1987 the range received the Phase 3 facelift.

After French production came to an end in 1989, Sanfu Motors had to source parts from Argentina and Colombia instead. While this did allow them to lower the price, it had a negative impact on quality and thus on Renault&#x27;s reputation in Taiwan. After the 1990 introduction of the Renault 19 to Taiwan, production of the R11 was halted, with sales coming to an end in February 1991. In 1993 a facelifted version of the 9 was introduced, now called the Renault Luxmore (雷諾銀鑽). Sold as a sedan only, this had a restyled front end combined with the Renault 19 Chamade&#x27;s taillights, and also adapted much of the 19&#x27;s interior. The Luxmore&#x27;s engine was a 1.4-liter &quot;Energy&quot; SOHC unit borrowed from the Clio, producing . Production ended in 1996 and the revised front end became used for the Phase 4 design built in Turkey beginning in 1997.

=== Turkey ===
Built by Oyak-Renault in Bursa beginning in 1985, the Renault 9 retained the original &quot;Phase 1&quot; bodystyle until 1993. the Phase 2 Renault 9 was not built there, although a number of minor external and internal changes were carried out over the years. In 1986 the diesel-engined GTD joined the GTL in local production, becoming the first diesel-engined passenger car to be built in Turkey. There followed the petrol-engined GTC (1987) and the Broadway replaced the GTL in 1988. A Broadway GTE model also appeared around this time. The GTC was replaced by a new base model called the Renault 9 in Spring 1991. Power varied between depending on model and year. In April 1993, the range was updated, using the Phase 2 facelift front. The 1.4-liter Broadway with 72 PS replaced the Spring and other models, while the 1.6-liter Fairway model was added, using the Argentinian C2L engine with a twin-barrel Weber carburetor. The Fairway received the headlights and various trim parts from the 11 Flash S in September 1994 but was discontinued in the first half of 1996 due to dropping sales.

A modernized, more ovoid design (phase 3) was released in Turkey in 1997 as the Renault Broadway and was sold there until 2000. From 1996, the 1.4-litre engine (now the only size available) received fuel injection in order to meet European emissions standards. These late models were initially sold as the RNi, later simply 1.4i, and produce .

The five-door Renault 11 was built in Turkey in 1.4-liter GTS trim from 1987. The following year the 1.7-liter TXE version was added, better known as the 11 Flash. The three-door 11 was never assembled by Oyak-Renault. To celebrate Galatasaray reaching the semifinals in the 1989 European Champions Clubs&#x27; Cup, a special edition of 500 cars called the Flash Galatasaray was produced. In 1990, there was a Fenerbahçe special edition. Both of these featured elements in the team colours and various other special equipment. In 1993, the 11 was facelifted (Phase 3), with the GTS replaced by a 1.6-liter 11 Rainbow, matching the Renault 9 Fairway. The 11 Flash S replaced the earlier Flash model, offering the exterior design features of the 11 Turbo with Speedline Renault 5 GT Turbo wheels (but produced by CMS wheels) and an upgraded engine producing . The 11 ceased production in Turkey in 1995.

=== United States and Canada ===


The subcompact sized automobile was manufactured and marketed in North America by American Motors Corporation (AMC) as the Renault Alliance from model years 1983 to 1987, and with a three and five door hatchback variant, the Renault Encore marketed beginning in 1984. For 1987, AMC offered the one year only GTA Sedan and Convertible, which included a 2.0 L engine, sport suspension, ZENDER GmbH aerodynamic body kit, and Ronal wheels. The Encore was renamed to Alliance Hatchback in the same year.

Production of the Alliance and GTA was discontinued after Chrysler&#x27;s buyout of AMC in 1987. A total of 623,573 units were manufactured.

== In culture ==
In the 1985 James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; a Renault 11 TXE taxi plays a significant role. Renowned stuntman Rémy Julienne coordinates a sequence in which the roof of the Renault 11 is torn off and the car is cut in half during a collision with a Renault 20.

<text>The sacramental index is a statistic sometimes used by Roman Catholic bishops as a rough approximation of how active a parish is, based on the occurrence of sacraments or rites of passage. The precise formula varies; in the Archdiocese of Boston, the sacramental index for a parish is calculated by adding the total numbers of baptisms and funerals, and twice the number of weddings.

The index is used to help determine the number of priests assigned to a parish.

<text>The Indy, code-named &quot;Guinness&quot;, is a low-end multimedia workstation introduced on July 12, 1993 by Silicon Graphics Incorporated (SGI). SGI developed, manufactured, and marketed Indy as the lowest end of its product line, for computer-aided design (CAD), desktop publishing, and multimedia markets. It competed with Intel x86 computers, and with Windows and Macintosh, including using their files and running their applications via software emulation. It is the first computer to come standard with a video camera, called IndyCam.

Indy was repackaged as a server model called Challenge S. Indy was discontinued on June 30, 1997, and support ended on December 31, 2011.

== Hardware ==
The Indy is one of the smaller form factors of the time (41 cm × 36 cm × 8 cm). The sturdy, electric-blue colored &quot;pizza box&quot; chassis is comparable to a contemporary small desktop PC, and is intended to fit underneath a large CRT monitor. Designed for multimedia use, the Indy includes analog and digital I/O, 6-channel digital audio processing, SCSI, and inputs for composite and S-Video. It has ISDN and Ethernet ports. It is the first computer to include a video camera, called IndyCam.

The base Indy model was launched in July 1993 at , without a hard drive, or diskless, and is intended for networked use. The model with 2 GB hard drive was launched at . The base model was launched with 16 MB of RAM and can be expanded to 256 MB. Later in 1993, that duo was updated to have the base model with a 535 MB hard drive ( in January 1994) and the high end with 24-bit color, 32 MB RAM, and 1 GB hard drive ( in January 1994). In March 1994, the series was refreshed with a new 150 MHz R4400 CPU, and the low end model has 8-bit color, 32 MB RAM, 535 MB hard drive, and 16-inch 1280 x 1024 monitor for and the high end has 24-bit color, 64 MB RAM, 1 GB hard drive for .

Sales of low-cost high-performance workstations were projected to triple from 1994 to 1999, and competition for that market increased between Sun and SGI. In February 1995, SGI targeted &quot;high-performance iron&quot; at junior engineers by refreshing the Indy series with two models: the Indy Modeler PC and SC systems starting at with a 133 MHz R4600 CPU, 1 GB hard drive, 32 MB of RAM, and 20-inch monitor. Time Warner Cable and US West created an experimental interactive video-on-demand service via cable television, based on Indy.

The optional floptical drive uses 21 MB disks and standard 3.5&quot; magnetic floppy disks.

=== CPU ===
Indy&#x27;s motherboard has a socket for the Processor Module (PM). Indy was launched with a 100 MHz MIPS R4000PC microprocessor upgrade option. The Indy, at the bottom of SGI&#x27;s price list, was then upgraded with the MIPS R4400 and the low-cost, low-power-consumption Quantum Effect Devices (QED) R4600. The R4600 has higher integer performance, but lesser floating-point capability. The R4600 appears outside the Indy line briefly once, in the SGI Indigo². A number of limits, such as the series of microprocessor issues, the relatively low-powered graphics boards, lower maximum RAM amount, and relative lack of internal expansion ability compared to the SGI Indigo, led to the Indy being pejoratively described by industry insiders as &quot;An Indigo without the &#x27;go&#x27;.&quot;

As the R4600 chip itself has no L2 cache controller, an external controller is used to add 512K of L2 cache. R4600s processor modules, both with an L2 cache (SC) and without (PC), have been produced for the Indy. At the same clock rate, the SC version of the processor module is generally 20 to 40 percent faster than the PC version, due to the memory cache.

The Indy is the first SGI machine to utilize the QED R5000 microprocessor, which offers significant advantages over the R4400 and R4600 it replaced.

The performance of the 100 MHz R4000 in conjunction with 500 KB of secondary cache, this cache not being provided on the base model, was described as broadly comparable to Intel&#x27;s 66 MHz Pentium, at least in terms of published benchmark results, although that particular version of the Pentium was &quot;still a few months off&quot; at the time of early reviews of the machine. Indy was reportedly seen by SGI as a rival to high-end Macs in the graphics rendering market, with claims of &quot;40 times the performance of a machine with a 68030&quot;.

=== Graphics ===
Three graphics subsystems have been produced for the Indy: 8-bit XL, 24-bit XL, and 24-bit XZ. Each support a maximum resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels at a refresh rate of 76 Hz, and have a 13W3 monitor connection. Graphics options are connected to the system using a GIO32bis bus.

==== 8-bit XL ====
Also known as &quot;Newport&quot; graphics and based on the REX3 chipset, these were designed for general 2D X11 applications; no hardware 3D acceleration is included. This is the first accelerator to demonstrate object-based antialiasing and exact sub-pixel lines using Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm.

==== 24-bit XL (XGE) ====
Using a circuit board identical to that of the 8-bit XL, the 24-bit XL includes three times as much framebuffer memory to accommodate 24-bit color.

In an Indy with an R5000 CPU, these graphics options are called XGE, because an R5000 CPU can perform 3D geometry calculations faster than the XZ subsystems&#x27;s four Geometry Engines. As a result, all 3D is done in software. The situation is, however, reversed when the calculations are done for full-screen rendering and involve z-buffer operations (which XL does not possess). XZ graphics are rarely paired with the R5000 for this reason.

==== XZ ====
This graphics option is a conversion of the Indigo²&#x27;s XZ (Elan) graphics into Indy. They offer very good non-textured 3D performance for the time, sacrificing a bit of 2D performance in return. The XZ graphics option has not been popular in Indy models that used the R5000 microprocessor. This is mostly due to the R5000&#x27;s MIPS IV architecture, which enhanced MIPS&#x27; floating-point arithmetic capabilities, allowing coordinate transformations to be performed faster than the XZ graphics board. However, using XZ to perform coordinate transforms does free the CPU to perform other rendering-related calculations. If the application is not transform-limited (limited by the speed of coordinate transformation), then the XZ option can provide significant rasterization performance advantages over the XL boards.

These graphics take the form of two boards, vertically layered, and block both GIO option slots, making them less favorable because options such as 10/100 Ethernet and JPEG compression boards cannot be installed.

=== Video ===
The Indy is the first computer to have a standard video camera, and the first SGI computer to have standard video inputs. Each Indy has an amateur quality composite, S-Video, and digital video input built into the motherboard, which collectively are known as &quot;Vino&quot; (video input, no output) video. The digital input is a SGI Digital Video Interface (proprietary D-sub connector) with a rectangular high density array of 60 pins, and is used by the IndyCam. The connector incorporates two digital video ports, but only uses the first one for input on the Indy. The protocol is similar to the CCIR 601 Parallel Video interface.

The maximum supported input resolution is 640×480 for NTSC or 768×576 for PAL. A fast machine is required to capture at either of these resolutions, though; an Indy with slower R4600PC CPU, for example, may require the input resolution to be reduced before storage or processing. However, the Vino hardware is capable of DMAing video fields directly into the framebuffer with minimal CPU overhead.

The IndyCam is a small fixed-focus digital video camera, co-developed by SGI and Teleview Research. It can be mounted above the monitor, or hand-held. It is one of the first desktop video cameras and the first to come standard on a computer. With the bundled software, it can be used for video conferencing, video editing, or video email.

None of the Indy models support a video output by default, and that would require the Indy Video GIO32 card. An optional CosmoCompress module offers real-time JPEG video compression and decompression and uses another GIO32 slot.

=== Storage ===
The Indy has two drive bays for 1-inch tall 3.5&quot; drives. The upper drive bay is externally accessible and may hold a SCSI floptical drive. All external and internal drives share a single Fast SCSI bus (unless a GIO32 SCSI card has been installed).

External CD-ROM drives connect via SCSI connector at the rear side of the box. The typical drive supports boot, OS install, audio. A special ROM is required to boot from for certain device types.
A small number of CD-ROM drives have the firmware needed to do audio over SCSI.

=== Networking ===
All Indy models shipped with AUI/10BASE-T Ethernet and ISDN as standard equipment. The Ethernet ports are half-duplex only. The 10BASE-T port takes precedence over the AUI port; if the system detects a carrier on both ports, it will use the 10BASE-T.

Two different manufacturers produced 100BASE-TX Ethernet cards compatible with the Indy, both of which attached to the system using the GIO32 bus. Set Engineering produced one such fast Ethernet card, based on the Texas Instruments ThunderLAN chipset, under contract with SGI. Phobos also produced models of fast Ethernet cards for the Indy (the G100 and G130).

The ISDN port provided on the Indy has no NT1. An external NT1 is required to use the ISDN port in North America.

==Software==
Indy was launched with the IRIX 5.1 operating system, by which it is binary-compatible across the entire SGI family. 5.1 does not take full advantage of the hardware due to inadequate memory management. Later in 1993, SGI increased the base specification to 32 MB. IRIX 5.2 and later have much more efficient memory usage. The latest release of IRIX available for the Indy workstations is 6.5.22. Indy includes a CD of video games.

Indy competed with Windows and Macintosh, including using their files and running their applications via software emulation. One commentator remarked that using Quorum&#x27;s Latitude technology, &quot;Indy blows Macs away using the Mac&#x27;s own software&quot;, also expressing similar sentiments about Windows support provided by SoftPC. AutoCAD Designer was priced at to target the affordable CAD market, including Indy.

==Challenge S==

The Challenge S is a variant of the Indy for low-end server usage. It has an identical case as the Indy except for the name badge, with a nearly identical motherboard, but without any graphics or sound hardware. Vestigial volume control buttons on the front are not connected to anything. The Challenge S comes with an ISDN port and a 10 Mbit/s AUI Ethernet port. All local administration is performed by serial console to one of the two DIN-8 serial ports, which can be used to reach the PROM prompt and uses the same pin-out found on Macintosh serial ports.

==Reception==
At launch, SGI said it expected to sell worth of Indy units.

&quot;Electronic Design&quot; reviewed the Indy at launch in July 1993, saying that the IndyCam and video input marked a new standard for workstations. Jonathan Chevreau of the &quot;National Post&quot; wrote several articles at Indy&#x27;s launch, making a headline out of the standardization of a video camera on a personal computer, speculating this could mark the convergence of consumer electronics with the computer industry. On August 21, 1993, he said the Indy was &quot;one of the most interesting new products in the personal computer industry&quot; as SGI&#x27;s first price breakthrough for individuals. He said Indy&#x27;s video power and Indigo Magic Desktop GUI make it &quot;much more than a personal computer&quot;, with a sophistication that &quot;clone companies will be slow in imitating&quot;. He summarized, &quot;Anyone interested in the booming new field of multimedia and the convergence of personal computers with consumer electronics and telecommunications would be smitten by a serious case of techno-lust by the Indy.&quot; He said the Indy positioned SGI at the forefront of the birth of the major industry of desktop multimedia, as the best recent multimedia computer next to the Macintosh Quadra 840AV and Centris 660AV. &quot;Machine Design&quot; magazine called Indy &quot;the only computer to come standard with a color digital video camera, IndyCam&quot;. &quot;Mechanical Engineering&quot; magazine said &quot;the most unique feature of the Indy system is its integrated digital media capabilities&quot;, such as IndyCam, video input port, and applications for video conferencing and multimedia creation. &quot;Byte&quot; magazine said in September 1993 that Apple and SGI were trailblazers by setting audio and video as default features of the Macintosh and Indy desktop PCs, which &quot;could change the way businesspeople communicate&quot;. In 1994, &quot;Byte&quot; called the new Indy &quot;low on price but high on graphics performance&quot;, noting its interoperability with Windows and Macintosh.

<text>The White League, also known as the White Man&#x27;s League, was a white supremacist paramilitary terrorist organization started in the Southern United States in 1874 to intimidate freedmen (emancipated Black former slaves) into not voting and prevent Republican Party political organizing, while also being supported by regional elements of the Democratic Party. Its first chapter was formed in Grant Parish, Louisiana, and neighboring parishes and was made up of many of the Confederate veterans who had participated in the Colfax massacre in April 1873. Chapters were soon founded in New Orleans and other areas of the state.

==History==

Although sometimes linked to the secret vigilante groups the Ku Klux Klan and Knights of the White Camelia, the White League and other paramilitary groups of the later 1870s worked quite differently. They operated openly, solicited coverage from newspapers, and the men&#x27;s identities were generally known. Similar paramilitary groups were chapters of the Red Shirts, started in Mississippi in 1875 and active also in North and South Carolina. Their explicit political goal was to overthrow the Reconstruction government, and to do so they directed their activities toward intimidation and removal of Northern and African American Republican candidates and officeholders. Made up of well-armed Confederate veterans, they worked to turn Republicans out of office, disrupt their political organizing, and use force to intimidate and terrorize freedmen to keep them from the polls. Backers helped finance purchases of up-to-date arms: Winchester rifles, Colt revolvers, and Prussian needle guns.

The first unit of the White League, founded in 1874, was composed of members of Christopher Columbus Nash&#x27;s force, mostly Confederate veterans who had participated in the Colfax Massacre. It expressed its purpose to defend a &quot;hereditary civilization and Christianity menaced by a stupid Africanization.&quot;

In 1874, White League members murdered Julie Hayden, a 17-year-old African American girl who was working as a schoolteacher in Hartsville, Tennessee.

In his December 1874 State of the Union address, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant expressed disdain over the White League&#x27;s activities, condemning them for their violence and for violating the civil rights of freedmen:

The Coushatta massacre occurred in another Red River Parish: the local White League forced six Republican officeholders to resign and promise to leave the state. The League assassinated the men before they left the parish, together with between five and twenty freedmen (sources differ) who were witnesses. Generally in remote areas, the White League&#x27;s show of force and outright murders always overcame opposition. They were Confederate veterans, experienced and well armed.

Later in 1874, the New Orleans Metropolitan Police, established as a state militia by the Republican governor, attempted to intercept a shipment of arms to the League. The League had entered the city to try to take over state government, in the aftermath of the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election. In the subsequent Battle of Liberty Place on September 14, 1874, 5,000 members of the White League routed 3,500 police and state militia to turn out the Republican governor. They demanded the resignation of Governor William Pitt Kellogg in favor of John McEnery, the Democratic candidate. Kellogg refused and the White League briefly fought a battle resulting in 100 casualties. They took over and controlled the State House, City Hall and arsenal for three days, withdrawing just ahead of Federal troops and ships&#x27; arriving to reinforce the government. Kellogg had requested aid from U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant; once the troops arrived, he was restored to office.

President Grant sent additional U.S. troops within a month in another effort to try to pacify the Red River valley in northern Louisiana. It had been plagued by violence, including the massacres at Colfax in 1873 and Coushatta in 1874. The White League was effective; voting by Republicans decreased and Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1876.

==Legacy==
A Battle of Liberty Place Monument was erected in New Orleans in 1891. The monument initially celebrated the Battle of Liberty Place, also known as the Battle of Canal Street, which was a failed coup d&#x27;état and riot led by White League paramilitary terrorists in September 1874. In December 2016, the city council voted to remove the monument, and its removal was upheld by a federal appeals court in March 2017.

<text>Hubert &quot;Hubie&quot; Brooks (born September 24, 1956) is an American former professional baseball right fielder, third baseman, and shortstop. He played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1980 to 1994 for the New York Mets, Montreal Expos, Los Angeles Dodgers, California Angels, and Kansas City Royals. Brooks was selected third overall in the 1978 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets and went on to play for five different teams over a 15-year career, and was twice named an All-Star. MLB pitcher Donnie Moore was Brooks&#x27; cousin.

==Early years==
Brooks was drafted by the Montreal Expos as a senior at Manuel Dominguez High School in the 1974 Major League Baseball Draft but chose instead to attend Whittier College and stayed for 1975 through 1976 before transferring to Arizona State University. With the Arizona State Sun Devils, Brooks appeared in two NCAA College World Series, winning in 1977. The ASU shortstop was drafted fifth overall in the January secondary draft by the Kansas City Royals, fourteenth overall in the June 1976 secondary draft by the Chicago White Sox, second overall in the January secondary draft by the Oakland Athletics, and again by the White Sox third overall in the June 1977 secondary draft; however, he did not sign with any team. After he played out his college career, he was drafted by the Mets third overall in the amateur draft, two selections behind ASU teammate Bob Horner.

Unlike Horner, who was assigned to the Atlanta Braves&#x27; major league roster upon signing, Brooks was assigned to the double A Jackson Mets, where he batted .216 with 3 home runs and 16 RBIs in 45 games. The following season, with fellow Mets prospect Wally Backman playing short for Jackson, Brooks was converted to a third baseman. He also played some outfield with the triple A Tidewater Tides in .

==New York Mets==
Brooks debuted as a September call-up in 1980. In 24 games, Brooks batted .309 with 1 home run and 10 runs batted in. He won the starting job at third out of Spring training and quickly became a fan favorite, batting over .300 for most of the strike shortened season. He finished the season at .307 with four home runs and 38 RBIs to finish third in National League Rookie of the Year voting behind Fernando Valenzuela and Tim Raines.

Given the Mets&#x27; longstanding challenges in maintaining a consistent third baseman, Brooks remained popular in New York City despite being a below-average fielder and as power hitter. (He tied a modern major league record by committing three errors in one inning his rookie season.)

He set a Mets record with a 24-game hitting streak from May 1 to June 1, ; during this period, he batted .398 in 83 at-bats. (The record has since been tied by Mike Piazza in and broken by David Wright with 26 and Moisés Alou with 30 in .) He was having his best season statistically—having already set career highs in home runs (13) and RBIs (61)—when the Mets acquired third baseman Ray Knight from the Houston Astros on August 28. Brooks was subsequently shifted to short for the rest of the season by Mets manager Davey Johnson.

==Montreal Expos==
Montreal Expos shortstops batted .212 with no home runs and 35 RBIs in 1984. Thus, the team went into the offseason looking to upgrade at that position. On December 10, 1984, the Expos and Mets pulled off the blockbuster deal of the Winter Meetings when the Mets sent Brooks, pitcher Floyd Youmans, catcher Mike Fitzgerald, and outfielder Herm Winningham to the Expos for perennial All-Star catcher Gary Carter.

Plugged into the clean-up spot in Montreal&#x27;s batting order, Brooks blossomed into a Silver Slugger Award–winning shortstop in . He drove in a career-high 100 runs, which led the team and was second only to Cal Ripken Jr. among major league shortstops (110). Brooks was batting .333 with 14 home runs and 54 RBIs at the All-Star break to earn his first All-Star selection. Five games after the break, however, he tore ligaments in his left thumb, ending his season. He was named the NL&#x27;s Silver Slugger at short for a second season in a row regardless of his time missed.

Three games into the season, Brooks was again sidelined by injury, this time by a hairline fracture of his right wrist. When he returned to the field, he resumed his role as the top slugging shortstop in the National League. Despite having missed more than a month of play with his wrist injury, Brooks clubbed 7 home runs and drove in 30 runs to earn his second consecutive All-Star nod. The game went into extra innings and was won by the National League when Brooks and Ozzie Virgil Jr. scored on Tim Raines&#x27; triple in the thirteenth inning.

Following an injury to minor league outfield prospect Larry Walker playing winter ball, the Expos shifted Brooks to right field for the season. Despite his disappointment with the situation, Brooks responded with one of his best offensive seasons, batting .279 with 90 RBIs and a career-high 20 home runs. He spent one more season in right field for the Expos before departing via free agency.

==Los Angeles Dodgers==
The Atlanta Braves expressed interest in signing Brooks and returning him to third base for the season. However, Brooks ultimately opted to sign with his home team Los Angeles Dodgers and remain in right field. His contract contained a clause that disallowed him to be traded back to the Expos or to any American League team except the California Angels.

Brooks batted .266 with 20 home runs and 91 RBIs in his only season with the Dodgers, after which he was traded back to the New York Mets for pitchers Greg Hansell and Bob Ojeda.

Brooks was unhappy about this trade, and it resulted in a poor performance on the field. He batted .238 with 16 home runs and 50 RBIs through 103 games when his season was cut short by a pinched nerve in his back.

==California Angels==
On December 10, 1991, the Mets traded him to the California Angels for outfielder Dave Gallagher, reuniting him with his former Expos manager, Buck Rodgers. Brooks was used as the designated hitter by Rodgers, and batted .213 with 7 home runs and 30 RBIs until a sprained neck sidelined his season. He returned in the beginning of September, with John Wathan replacing Rodgers as manager, but hit just one home run and drove in just six in limited play over the rest of the season.

==Kansas City Royals==
The Kansas City Royals signed Brooks to a minor league deal with an invitation to Spring training for the season. He made the club as its right-handed bat off the bench and batted .303 as a pinch hitter. He remained in that role through the midpoint of the season when he was released to make room for a re-activated Wally Joyner, who was returning from the disabled list.

==Career stats==

At the time of his dismissal, Brooks was the active major league leader in games played without making it to the post season (1,645). After the end of his career, Brooks received no votes from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America for the Baseball Hall of Fame and was subsequently removed from the ballot. He collected career-highs in home runs (20) in 1988 and 1990. He collected his career-high RBI total (100) in 1985, and he finished 8th in batting average (.307) in 1981.

<text>Butter chicken is an Indian dish originating in Delhi. It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (&quot;makhan&quot;) sauce. Its sauce is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.

==History==
The curry was developed at the Moti Mahal restaurant in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Old Delhi in the 1950s, after the Partition of India by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral, who were both Punjabi refugees from Peshawar, North-West Frontier Province, British India. The curry was made &quot;by chance&quot; by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato sauce, rich in butter (&quot;makhan&quot;). 

In 1975, the English phrase &quot;butter chicken&quot; curry first appeared in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan. In Toronto and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls, while in Australia and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling. The curry is common in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and many other countries where a South Asian diaspora is present. Due to its popularity outside of India, it is sometimes mistakenly believed to be of Western origin (like chicken tikka masala, which it is sometimes confused with).

In 2024, the family of Gujral (who run Moti Mahal) sued the family of Jaggi (who run a rival restaurant) in a dispute over credit for inventing the dish.

==Preparation==
Chicken is marinated for several hours in a mixture of lemon juice, dahi (yogurt), Kashmiri red chilli, salt, garam masala, ginger paste, and garlic paste.

The marinated chicken is cooked in a tandoor (traditional clay oven), but may be grilled, oven-roasted, or pan-fried. It is served in a mild curry sauce that includes butter. The sauce is a tomato, garlic, and ginger-based sauce that is simmered until smooth and much of the water has evaporated. There are many variations on the composition and spicing of the sauce, which is sieved so that it is velvety smooth. Spices may include cardamom, cumin, cloves, cinnamon, coriander, pepper, garam masala, and fenugreek (Punjabi/Hindi: kasuri methi). Cashew paste may be used as a thickener and it is finally garnished with coriander.

<text>Danielle Riley Keough ( ; born May 29, 1989) is an American actress and the eldest grandchild of Elvis Presley. She made her feature film debut in a supporting part in the musical biopic &quot;The Runaways&quot; (2010), portraying Marie Currie. Keough subsequently starred in the independent thriller &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; (2011), before being cast in a minor role in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Magic Mike&quot; (2012). She appeared in her first big-budget release in the action feature &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot; (2015).

In 2016, Keough had her breakthrough role as an escort in the first season of the anthology series &quot;The Girlfriend Experience&quot;, earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress. Her performance as a wayward young woman in the drama &quot;American Honey&quot; (2016) earned her further acclaim, including an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Supporting Female.

Keough went on to star in the horror film &quot;It Comes at Night&quot; (2017) and in Soderbergh&#x27;s heist film &quot;Logan Lucky&quot; (2017); she then appeared in the horror films &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot; (2018) and &quot;The Lodge&quot; (2019). Following a leading role in the comedy-drama &quot;Zola&quot; (2020), Keough starred in the Amazon Prime Video thriller series &quot;The Terminal List&quot; (2022) and drama miniseries &quot;Daisy Jones &amp; the Six&quot; (2023). The latter earned her nominations for another Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy Award.

Keough is a co-founder of the production company Felix Culpa. She has co-directed the drama &quot;War Pony&quot; (2022), which won the Caméra d&#x27;Or. She became the sole owner of Elvis Presley&#x27;s estate Graceland, following her mother Lisa Marie Presley&#x27;s death in 2023.

==Early life and education==
Keough was born on May 29, 1989, at Providence Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. She is the eldest child of singer-songwriter Lisa Marie Presley (1968–2023) and musician Danny Keough, and the eldest grandchild of Elvis Presley and actress and businesswoman Priscilla Presley. Keough&#x27;s father met her mother at the Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre and later played bass in Presley&#x27;s band. She had a brother, Benjamin Storm Keough (1992–2020), and has two half-sisters from her mother&#x27;s fourth marriage, to Michael Lockwood. Her maternal grandmother, Priscilla, is of part Norwegian descent. Keough&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Janet Hollander, co-founded the Delphian School and served as its dean from 1995 to 2011.

When Keough was five years old, her parents divorced, and her mother was briefly married to Michael Jackson from 1994 to 1996. Of her upbringing, Keough said that she &quot;grew up very privileged with my mother, but my dad didn&#x27;t live like that. And I think experiencing both sides has been helpful. My father had mattresses on the floor of his apartments. He lived in cabins and trailer parks. He just didn&#x27;t have much money... Actually, my memories of growing up with him were so colourful and eccentric and fun. It was a good vibe, you know? When I was like eight I told him, &#x27;I want to grow up and be poor like you!&#x27; He was eating a bowl of cereal. I didn&#x27;t realize how wildly offensive that was!&quot;

Keough was raised primarily by her father in Hawaii and Los Angeles, though she at times lived at her mother&#x27;s Los Angeles home, as well as at the Graceland Estate in Memphis, Tennessee, which her mother inherited following her grandfather Elvis&#x27;s death. She is now the sole guardian of the estate and presides over the sub-trusts of her siblings, each inheriting one-third of their mother&#x27;s estate including Graceland and the Elvis estate.

In 2002, when Keough was 13 years old, her mother married actor Nicolas Cage, though this marriage was also short-lived, lasting 107 days before Cage filed for divorce. The divorce was finalized in May 2004. For a time, Keough attended a public school in the San Fernando Valley, but was ultimately homeschooled due to her having to frequently travel between her parents&#x27; homes.

==Career==
===2004–2008: Modeling ===
Prior to beginning a film career, Keough began modeling at age 15, appearing in the Autumn/Winter 2004 ready-to-wear show for Dolce &amp; Gabbana, followed by the Christian Dior ready-to-wear show for the Spring/Summer 2005 collection. Keough subsequently appeared on the United States cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; in August 2004. In 2005 she appeared on four magazine covers: Japanese &quot;Elle&quot; magazine, Korean &quot;Vogue&quot;, the French magazines &quot;Jalouse&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Officiel&quot;.

In 2010, at the age of 20, Keough made her film debut in &quot;The Runaways&quot; based on the 1970s all-girl rock band of the same name. Keough portrayed the role of Marie Currie, sister to the band&#x27;s lead singer Cherie Currie, portrayed by Dakota Fanning. The film also starred Kristen Stewart and Tatum O&#x27;Neal and premiered in 2010 at the Sundance Film Festival to favorable reviews.

In April 2011, Keough starred as the female lead in the drama &quot;The Good Doctor&quot; alongside Orlando Bloom and Taraji P. Henson.

Keough then co-starred in the independent drama &quot;Yellow&quot;, alongside Sienna Miller, Luke Wilson and David Morse, followed by a supporting role opposite Milo Ventimiglia in the independent vampire film &quot;Kiss of the Damned&quot;, which premiered at the 2012 Venice Film Festival.

The 13-episode series premiered on Starz on April 10, 2016. Her performance in &quot;The Girlfriend Experience&quot; garnered rave reviews and awards buzz from critics. She went on to receive a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for Television.
Also in 2016, Keough appeared in Andrea Arnold&#x27;s drama film &quot;American Honey&quot;, alongside Shia LaBeouf. The film premiered in competition at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize. Keough received praise for her role in the film, and received a nomination at the Film Independent Spirit Awards for Best Supporting Female. The same year, she appeared in &quot;The Discovery&quot; directed by Charlie McDowell.

In May 2018, Keough debuted two films at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival: Lars von Trier&#x27;s controversial psychological horror film &quot;The House That Jack Built&quot;, which was subsequently given a limited release in the United States by IFC Films, and David Robert Mitchell&#x27;s neo-noir &quot;Under the Silver Lake&quot;, which was given a limited release in April 2019.

Next, Keough starred in the lead role in the psychological horror film &quot;The Lodge&quot; (2019), portraying a woman raised in a cult. The film, which premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival before being released theatrically in February 2020, garnered Keough praise, with Michael Roffman of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; deeming it a &quot;career-best performance.&quot; Justin Chang of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; also lauded her performance as the film&#x27;s &quot;strongest asset.

<text>Helmut Schelsky (14 October 1912 – 24 February 1984), was a German sociologist, the most influential in post-World War II Germany, well into the 1970s.

==Biography==
Schelsky was born in Chemnitz, Saxony. He turned to social philosophy and even more to sociology, as elaborated at the University of Leipzig by Hans Freyer (the &quot;Leipzig School&quot;). Having earned his doctorate in 1935 (thesis [tr.]: &quot;The theory of community in the 1796 natural law by Fichte&quot;), in 1939 he qualified as a lecturer (&quot;Habilitation&quot;) with a thesis on the political thought of Thomas Hobbes at the University of Königsberg. He was called up in 1941, so did not take up his first chair of Sociology at the (then German) Reichsuniversität Straßburg in 1944.

After the fall of the Third Reich in 1945, Schelsky joined the German Red Cross and formed its effective &quot;Suchdienst&quot; (service to trace down missing persons). In 1949 he became a professor at the Hamburg &quot;Hochschule für Arbeit und Politik&quot;, in 1953 at Hamburg University, and in 1960 he went to the University of Münster. There he headed what was then the biggest West German centre for social research, in Dortmund.

In 1970, Schelsky accepted the position of a professor of sociology at the newly founded Bielefeld University, which created the only German full &quot;Faculty of Sociology&quot;, as well as the &quot;Centre of Interdisciplinarian Research&quot; (&quot;Zentrum für Interdisziplinäre Forschung&quot; [ZiF] at Rheda), planned to be a &#x27;German Harvard&#x27;. However, his new university changed very much, due to the years of student unrest all over Europe and North America, so Schelsky returned to Münster in anger in 1973 and stayed there for another five years. He wrote several more books, against the Utopian way to approach Sociology, as fostered by the Frankfurt School, and on the Sociology of Law. 

He died in Münster in 1984.

==Schelsky and German sociology==

The &quot;Leipzig School&quot; (the social philosopher Hans Freyer, the anthropologist Arnold Gehlen, the philosopher Gotthard Günther), rich in the talents of a first generation, was of strong theoretical influence on Schelsky. But Freyer also dreamt of building up a sociological think tank for the Third Reich - quite differently to most other sociologists, e. g. to the (outspoken) anti-Hitlerian Ferdinand Tönnies (University of Kiel) and to Leopold von Wiese (University of Cologne), and to the émigrés (e. g. to Karl Mannheim, and to the up-and-coming René König, Paul Lazarsfeld, Norbert Elias, Theodor Adorno, Rudolf Heberle, and Lewis A. Coser). Freyer&#x27;s ambitions failed miserably, the Nazi power elite monopolizing ideology, but helped the talented student Schelsky in his first career steps.

After the Second World War, Schelsky became a star of applied sociology, due to his great gift of anticipating social and sociological developments. He published books on the theory of institutions, on social stratification, on the sociology of family, on the sociology of sexuality, on the sociology of youth, on Industrial Sociology, on the sociology of education, and on the sociology of the university system. In Dortmund, he made the Social Research Centre (″Sozialforschungsstelle″) a West German focus of empirical and theoretical studies, being especially gifted in finding and attracting first class social scientists, e.g. Dieter Claessens, Niklas Luhmann, and many more.

It helped that Schelsky was an outspoken liberal professor, without any ambition to create adherents. He helped another 17 sociologists qualify as lecturers (outnumbering in this any other professor in the Humanities and Social Sciences) and anticipated the boom in sociological chairs at German universities. Manning them, he was professionally even more successful than the outstanding remigrants René König (Cologne) and Otto Stammer (Berlin) - the Frankfurt School starting to be of influence only after 1968.

Schelsky was able to design Bielefeld University as an innovative institution of the highest academic quality, both in research and in thought. But the fact that his own university had moved away from his ideas hit him hard. His later books, criticizing ideological sociology (very much acclaimed now by conservative analysts) and on the sociology of law (quite influential in the Schools of Law) kept up his reputation as an outstanding thinker, but fell out of grace with younger sociologists. Moreover, his fascinating analyses, being of highest practical value, went out of date for the same reason; only by 2000 did new sociologists start to read him again.

<text>The Canadian Red Cross Society () is a Canadian humanitarian charitable organization, and one of 192 national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies. The organization receives funding from both private donations and from Canadian government departments.

The Canadian Red Cross trains volunteers in emergency response, disaster response, and disaster assistance, and provides injury prevention services such as outdoor activities safety and first aid training. The society, through the international network of the Red Cross, helps the world&#x27;s vulnerable populations, including victims of armed conflicts and communities destroyed by disasters. The Canadian Red Cross also handled the Canadian blood supply, until that responsibility was taken away from them in the aftermath of the tainted blood scandal.

The current Secretary General and Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Red Cross is Conrad Sauvé.

==History==

The Canadian Red Cross was established in the fall of 1896 as an affiliate of the British Red Cross Society (then known as the National Society for Aid to the Sick and Wounded in War). George Ryerson, who had founded Canada&#x27;s St. John Ambulance Association in 1895, spearheaded the organization&#x27;s founding. The Canadian Red Cross Society Act (1909) legally established the Red Cross as the corporate body in Canada responsible for providing volunteer aid in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.

The first international activity of the Canadian Red Cross was treating the sick and wounded in South Africa during the Boer War.

After the end of World War I in 1918, the Society began training public health nurses. The Wilberforce Red Cross Outpost was established in 1922. A children&#x27;s program designed to promote healthy living, the Junior Red Cross, was set up in schools across Canada.

For many years the Canadian Red Cross was responsible for collecting human blood from donors for medical use. The Ottawa Branch of Canadian Blood Services operated from a building on Metcalf Street which was donated by Mary Alice Danner in memory of Flight Sergeant William Dewey Hagyard R.C.A.F. who was missing in action in WWII. The branch later relocated to Plymouth Street. In 1998, after serious flaws in the blood collection process were uncovered, the Society stopped providing this service.

The Canadian Red Cross had its centennial celebration in May 2009. In 2017 the Red Cross provided food, shelter and medicine to asylum seekers crossing the border into Canada from the United States.

== Programs in Canada ==
===Emergencies and disasters===
The Canadian Red Cross provides assistance to Canadians experiencing an emergency or disaster. The organization works in partnership with government, first responders, emergency management, and other organizations to support their response activities. They also provide assistance for people&#x27;s basic needs, which includes: family reunification, lodging, reception and information, food, clothing, and personal services, such as first aid, temporary care for children or elderly, and other support. 

In February 2022, Canada Red Cross launched a program to support the long-term recovery needs of people impacted by the flooding and extreme weather events in British Columbia that began on November 14, 2021. The organization provided financial support to people from eligible households to help cover their interim housing and basic needs while they transition to longer-term housing.

===Community health services===

====Community support services====

The Canadian Red Cross offers a range of community support services that provide daily supports to older adults, vulnerable people, and their caregivers. The goal of these programs is to provide support in maintaining quality of life, independence, and active participation in society. Some of the programs and services available include: nutrition support programs (such as Meals on Wheels), social inclusion programs, assisted living in supportive housing and attendant outreach services, safety programs, and transportation. The availability of these programs varies. The Red Cross also provides services to homeless people during extreme weather.

====Health Equipment Loan Program (HELP)====

This program provides health equipment to individuals dealing with illness or injury, enabling them to return home from the hospital sooner or live more independently. The program operates in British Columbia, Alberta, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Yukon Territory. The types of assistive equipment that can be provided include: wheelchairs, walkers, bath seats and benches, commodes and toilet seats, crutches and canes, bed handles, and other durable medical equipment. The program is funded through financial donations as well as through the donation of used medical equipment, diverting it from the landfill, and it carried out with the support of volunteers and the health authorities.

====Home care services====

The Canadian Red Cross offers personal support and homemaking services to support the independent living of seniors and those recovering from illness or injury. These services include: personal care, home management, and respite and companion care. Home care services are available in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Ontario.

===Migrant and refugee services===

The Canadian Red Cross has been involved in the independent monitoring of detention facilities holding immigration detainees since 1999, following a request from Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). The organization provides independent monitoring to determine if detainees are treated humanely and their human rights and inherent dignity are respected. As of 2014, this includes visiting federal immigration holding facilities and some provincial correctional facilities in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Manitoba.

===Safety, first aid, and CPR===

The Canadian Red Cross is involved in treating the wounded on the fields of war and to training individuals to effectively handle emergencies both at home and in the workplace. The organization has been offering first aid and CPR training to Canadians for over 50 years. In an average year, about 600,000 Canadians are trained.

In 1946 the Red Cross Swimming and Water Safety programs were introduced as a result of a large number of drownings that occurred in Canada in the 1940s. Since then, more than 30 million Canadians, in more than 3,500 communities across Canada were to taught to swim and stay safe around water. The swimming program ended in 2022 to direct more attention to humanitarian efforts as the operations were transferred to the Lifesaving Society.

In 2012, The Canadian Red Cross and Lifesaving Society joined forces with the Public Health Agency of Canada to launch the Open Water Wisdom initiative, which is a community water activity safety program which promotes awareness of water safety issues nationally, including to remote communities across Canada.

== International programs ==
===Emergencies and disasters===

The Canadian Red Cross delivers primary healthcare programs, relief supplies, water, and sanitation and shelter solutions to vulnerable communities affected by conflict, disasters, and health emergencies. The Society&#x27;s international programming supports community-based programs that provide large-scale humanitarian aid.

===International development===

The Canadian Red Cross has long-term development programs in the regions of Africa, the Americas, Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa.

===Maternal, newborn, and child health===

The Canadian Red Cross supports community-based health programs which address preventable illness in mothers and children, including malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malnutrition, particularly in remote areas where there is a lack of health services and emergencies where health services have collapsed. They also provide education about reproduction, newborn care and breastfeeding, nutrition for young children, hygiene, sanitation, and methods of accessing potable water.

== Controversy ==

=== Krever Commission ===

Until September 28, 1998, the Canadian Red Cross was responsible for all blood services in Canada. On the recommendation of the Krever Commission, the organization was removed from this position and replaced by the Canadian Blood Services. This was due to nationwide controversy when it was revealed that the Canadian Red Cross had supplied, between 1986 and 1990, blood which it knew might be tainted with hepatitis C and HIV.

During the AIDS crisis, the Canadian Red Cross Society had accused the Haitian community of carrying the AIDS virus without any factual or empirical evidence and banned them from donating blood. Haitian communities and organizations had worked with other activist groups such as the AIDS Committee of Toronto and organized against the Red Cross due to this.

In 1994, an investigation found that 95 percent of hemophiliacs who used blood products supplied by the Canadian Red Cross prior to 1990 had contracted hepatitis C. According to the Krever Commission, approximately 85 percent of those infections could have been prevented. A case that calls attention to this statistic is the distribution of Marine Simon Thwaites&#x27; blood in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1983-1984. Their blood was not properly tested by the Canadian Red Cross before distribution. After his blood was administered he was notified that someone had a bad reaction to his blood and he was advised to seek further testing. Thwaites then tested HIV-positive shortly after and when he asked for more information on his condition from the Red Cross they responded by telling him they were unsure of what to do and directed him to return to work. 

The lack of testing donated blood continued to contribute to others becoming HIV-positive. Just a year later in December 1985, a child who received blood from the Canadian Red Cross passed away. After an autopsy was performed it was confirmed it was due to HIV. Reid Gagnon, also received blood from that batch of plasma, and was encouraged to get tested. He was found to be positive as well. It was confirmed that the Red Cross had not tested numerous batches of donated blood for HIV or antibodies although the testing was widely available. After patients tested HIV-positive, the Red Cross, the hospital where the transfusion occurred, and the surgeon present, were silent and never reached out to other patients. This is all despite Gagnon, and his wife Mary Gagnon, making an attempt to be seen and heard by the Red Cross. After Reid Gagnon passed, his wife finally heard from the hospital, however, it was only a request for the funds due. Mary Gagnon sent out a letter with her concerns and received no response from the Red Cross, only a hospital administrator apologizing and claiming in the future similar situations would be handled differently. 

In 1992, after this issue continued to occur, the gay community, hemophiliacs and people receiving blood transfusions reached out to have a conversation about the lack of testing performed on donated blood. The Red Cross refused to meet with them about this prominent issue. Responsibility was failed to be accepted by the Canadian Red Cross despite the seemingly never ending amount of affected peoples.

Compared to blood services in Europe and the United States, the CRC was slow to disseminate information about possible infection to those receiving blood products. More than 1,100 Canadians were infected with HIV and 20,000 contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions given by the Red Cross during that period.

The Canadian Red Cross was fined $5,000 for its role in the tainted blood scandal and the organization agreed to plead guilty to distributing a contaminated drug. It agreed to donate $1.5 million to the University of Ottawa for a research endowment fund, as well as a scholarship for the family members of those affected. In exchange, six criminal charges against the Canadian Red Cross were dropped.

Dr. Roger Perrault, the director of the Canadian Red Cross at the time, was put on trial for his role in the scandal. The first trial, in Toronto before the Superior Court of Justice, resulted in an acquittal. He had been charged with four counts of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and one of common nuisance. The counts of criminal negligence were specific to four victims who had contracted HIV from tainted blood. The second trial, in Hamilton, also before the Superior Court of Justice, resulted in charges being withdrawn. The charges were six counts of common nuisance and &quot;stemmed from an allegation he endangered the public by failing to properly screen donors, implement testing for blood-borne viruses and warn the public of the danger regarding hepatitis C and HIV&quot; and relate to a period of time in which the understanding of AIDS was even more rudimentary. The charges were withdrawn on the basis that there was no longer a reasonable prospect of conviction.

=== Investigation into alleged 2004 Indian tsunami worker abuse ===

An investigation conducted by Radio-Canada (CBC) first aired on March 17, 2010, on The National. It reported on the problems facing workers hired by Canadian Red Cross contractors during an effort to rebuild communities in the Indonesian province of Aceh.

<doc id="608992" wikidata="Q5347026" url="?curid=608992" title="Tarpaulin">
<text>A tarpaulin ( , ) or tarp is a large sheet of strong, flexible, water-resistant or waterproof material, often cloth such as canvas or polyester coated with polyurethane, or made of plastics such as polyethylene. Tarpaulins often have reinforced grommets at the corners and along the sides to form attachment points for rope, allowing them to be tied down or suspended.

Inexpensive modern tarpaulins are made from woven polyethylene; This material has become so commonly used for tarpaulins that people in some places refer to it colloquially as &quot;poly tarp&quot; or &quot;polytarp&quot;.

==Uses==

Tarpaulins are used in many ways to protect persons and things from wind, rain, and sunlight. They are used during construction or after disasters to protect partially built or damaged structures, to prevent mess during painting and similar activities, and to contain and collect debris. They are used to protect the loads of open trucks and wagons, to keep wood piles dry, and for shelters such as tents or other temporary structures.
Tarpaulins are also used for advertisement printing, most notably for billboards. Perforated tarpaulins are typically used for medium to large advertising, or for protection on scaffoldings; the aim of the perforations (from 20% to 70%) is to reduce wind vulnerability. 

Polyethylene tarpaulins have also proven to be a popular source when an inexpensive, water-resistant fabric is needed. Many amateur builders of plywood sailboats turn to polyethylene tarpaulins for making their sails, as it is inexpensive and easily worked. With the proper type of adhesive tape, it is possible to make a serviceable sail for a small boat with no sewing.

Plastic tarps are sometimes used as a building material in communities of indigenous North Americans. Tipis made with tarps are known as tarpees.

== Types ==
Tarpaulins can be classified based on a diversity of factors, such as material type (polyethylene, canvas, vinyl, etc.), thickness, which is generally measured in mils or generalized into categories (such as &quot;regular duty&quot;, &quot;heavy duty&quot;, &quot;super heavy duty&quot;, etc.), and grommet strength (simple vs. reinforced), among others.

Actual tarp sizes are generally about three to five percent smaller in each dimension than nominal size; for example, a tarp nominally will actually measure about .
Grommets may be aluminum, stainless steel, or other materials. Grommet-to-grommet distances are typically between and . The weave count is often between 8 and 12 per square inch: the greater the count, the greater its strength. Tarps may also be washable or non-washable and waterproof or non-waterproof, and mildewproof vs. non-mildewproof. Tarp flexibility is especially significant under cold conditions.

===Type of material ===

==== Polyethylene ====
A polyethylene tarpaulin (&quot;polytarp&quot;) is not a traditional fabric, but rather, a laminate of woven and sheet material. The center is loosely woven from strips of polyethylene plastic, with sheets of the same material bonded to the surface. This creates a fabric-like material that resists stretching well in all directions and is waterproof. Sheets can be either of low density polyethylene (LDPE) or high density polyethylene (HDPE). When treated against ultraviolet light, these tarpaulins can last for years exposed to the elements, but non-UV treated material will quickly become brittle and lose strength and water resistance if exposed to sunlight.

====Canvas====
Canvas tarpaulins are not 100% waterproof, though they are water resistant. Thus, while a small amount of water for a short period of time will not affect them, when there is standing water on canvas tarps, or when water cannot quickly drain away from canvas tarps, the standing water will drip through this type of tarp.

====Vinyl====
Polyvinyl chloride (&quot;vinyl&quot;) tarpaulins are industrial-grade and intended for heavy-duty use. They are constructed of coated yellow vinyl. This makes it waterproof and gives it a high abrasion resistance and tear strength. These resist oil, acid, grease and mildew. The vinyl tarp is ideal for agriculture, construction, industrial, trucks, flood barrier and temporary roof repair.

==== Silnylon ====
Tarp tents may be made of silnylon.

===U.S. color scheme===
For years manufacturers have used a color code to indicate the grade of tarpaulins, but not all manufacturers follow this traditional method of grading. Following this color-coded system, blue indicates a lightweight tarp, and typically has a weave count of 8×8 and a thickness of . Silver is a heavy-duty tarp and typically has a weave count of 14×14 and a thickness of .

Some of the more common colors in that scheme are:
==Etymology==
The word &quot;tarpaulin&quot; originated as a compound of the words &quot;tar&quot; and &quot;palling&quot;, referring to a tarred canvas pall used to cover objects on ships. Sailors often tarred their own overclothes in the same manner as the sheets or palls. By association, sailors became known as &quot;jack tars&quot;.

In the mid-19th century, &quot;paulin&quot; was used for such a cloth.

<doc id="608994" wikidata="Q1475460" url="?curid=608994" title="The Corporation (2003 film)">
<text>The Corporation is a 2003 Canadian documentary film written by University of British Columbia law professor Joel Bakan and filmmaker Harold Crooks, and directed by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott. The documentary examines the modern corporation. Bakan wrote the book &quot;The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power&quot; during the filming of the documentary.

A sequel film, &quot;The New Corporation: The Unfortunately Necessary Sequel&quot;, was released in 2020.

==Synopsis==
The documentary shows the development of the contemporary business corporation, from a legal entity that originated as a government-chartered institution meant to affect specific public functions, to the rise of the modern commercial institution entitled to most of the legal rights of a person. The documentary concentrates mostly upon corporations in North America, especially in the United States. One theme is its assessment of corporate personhood, as a result of an 1886 case in the Supreme Court of the United States in which a statement by Chief Justice Morrison Waite led to corporations as &quot;persons&quot; having the same rights as human beings, based on the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.
Topics addressed include the Business Plot, where in 1933, General Smedley Butler exposed an alleged corporate plot against then-U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt; the tragedy of the commons; Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s warning people to beware of the rising military–industrial complex; economic externalities; suppression of an investigative news story about Bovine Growth Hormone on Fox affiliate television station WTVT in Tampa, Florida, at the behest of Monsanto; the invention of the soft drink Fanta by The Coca-Cola Company due to the trade embargo on Nazi Germany; the alleged role of IBM in the Holocaust (see IBM and the Holocaust); the Cochabamba protests of 2000 brought on by the privatization of a municipal water supply in Bolivia; and in general themes of corporate social responsibility, the notion of limited liability, the corporation as a psychopath; and the debate about corporate personhood.

Through vignettes and interviews, &quot;The Corporation&quot; examines and criticizes corporate business practices. The film&#x27;s assessment is affected via the diagnostic criteria in the &quot;DSM-IV&quot;; Robert D. Hare, a University of British Columbia psychology professor and FBI consultant, compares the profile of the contemporary profitable business corporation to that of a clinically diagnosed psychopath (Hare has since objected to the manner in which his views are portrayed in the film; see below.). &quot;The Corporation&quot; attempts to compare the way corporations are systematically compelled to behave with what it claims are the &quot;DSM-IV&quot;″s symptoms of psychopathy, e.g., the callous disregard for the feelings of other people, the incapacity to maintain human relationships, the reckless disregard for the safety of others, the deceitfulness (continual lying to deceive for profit), the incapacity to experience guilt, and the failure to conform to social norms and respect the law.

===Interviews===
The film features interviews with prominent corporate critics such as Noam Chomsky, Charles Kernaghan, Naomi Klein, Michael Moore, Vandana Shiva, and Howard Zinn, as well as opinions from chief executive officers such as Ray Anderson (from Interface, Inc.), business guru Peter Drucker, Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman, and think tanks advocating free markets such as the Fraser Institute. Interviews also feature Dr. Samuel Epstein, who was involved in a lawsuit against Monsanto for promoting the use of Posilac (trade name for recombinant Bovine somatotropin) to induce more milk production in dairy cattle, and Chris Barrett who, as a spokesperson for First USA, was the first corporately sponsored college student in America.

Joel Bakan, the author of the award-winning book &quot;The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power&quot;, writes:


==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;The Corporation&quot; grossed around $3.5 million in North American box office receipts and had a worldwide gross of over $4.8 million, making it the second top-grossing film for its U.S. distributor, Zeitgeist Films. It took the place of &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; as the top-grossing feature documentary ever to come out of Canada.

===Versions===

====TVO version====
The extended edition made for TVOntario (TVO) separates the documentary into three one-hour episodes:
*&quot;Pathology of Commerce&quot;: About the pathological self-interest of the modern corporation.
*&quot;Planet Inc.&quot;: About the scope of commerce and the sophisticated, even covert, techniques marketers use to get their brands into our homes.
*&quot;Reckoning&quot;: About how corporations cut deals with any style of government - from Nazi Germany to despotic states today - that allow or even encourage sweatshops, as long as sales go up.

====DVD version====
In April 2005, the film was released on DVD as a two-disc set that includes following:

* Disc 1: the film, two tracks of directors&#x27; and writer&#x27;s commentary, 27 minutes of Q&amp;As with the filmmakers, 17 minutes of deleted scenes (not including a hidden clip of the &quot;Milton Friedman Choir&quot; singing &quot;An Ode To Privatization&quot;), 39 minutes of Janeane Garofalo interviewing Joel Bakan on Air America Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Majority Report&quot;, 7 minutes of Katherine Dodds on grassroots marketing, theatrical trailer, subtitles in three languages (English, French, Spanish), and descriptive audio.
* Disc 2: 165 unused interview clips and updates sorted by both interviewee (&quot;Hear More From...&quot;) and topic (&quot;Topical Paradise&quot;). &quot;Related Film Resources&quot;, which is one of the topics in &quot;Topical Paradise&quot;, includes trailers for 14 other documentary films and a three-minute UK animated film.

In 2012, a new Canadian educational version was released for high school students. This &quot;Occupy Your Future&quot; version is exclusively distributed by Hello Cool World, who were behind the branding and grassroots outreach of the original film in four countries. This version is shorter and breaks the film into three parts. The extras include interviews with Joel Bakan on the Occupy movement, Katherine Dodds on social branding, and two short films from Annie Leonard&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Stuff&quot; project.

===Streaming=== 

From 2017 until 2022, the film was formerly available for streaming online on Canada Media Fund&#x27;s Encore+ YouTube channel, licensed by Programming and Operations Lead Paulina Abarca-Cantin.

The film is also available for digital purchase on Amazon Prime Video and iTunes.

==Reception==

=== Critical reception ===
Film critics gave the film generally favorable reviews. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 111 reviews with an average rating of 7.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Corporation&quot; is a satisfyingly dense, thought-provoking rebuttal to some of capitalism&#x27;s central arguments.&quot; Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 28 reviews.

In &quot;Variety&quot;, Dennis Harvey praised the film&#x27;s &quot;surprisingly cogent, entertaining, even rabble-rousing indictment of perhaps the most influential institutional model for our era&quot; and its avoidance of &quot;a sense of excessively partisan rhetoric&quot; by deploying a wide range of interviewees and &quot;a bold organizational scheme that lets focus jump around in interconnective, humorous, hit-and-run fashion.&quot;

In the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert described the film as &quot;an impassioned polemic, filled with information sure to break up any dinner-table conversation,&quot; but felt that &quot;at 145 minutes, it overstays its welcome. The wise documentarian should treat film stock as a non-renewable commodity.&quot;

&quot;The Economist&quot; review, while calling the film &quot;a surprisingly rational coherent attack on capitalism&#x27;s most important institution&quot; and &quot;a thought-provoking account of the firm&quot;, calls it incomplete. It suggests that the idea for an organization as a psychopathic entity originated with Max Weber, in regards to government bureaucracy. The reviewer remarks that while the film weighs heavily in favor of public ownership as a solution to the issues depicted, it fails to acknowledge the magnitude of evils committed &quot;in the name&quot; of public ownership, such as those of the Communist Party in the former Soviet Union.

=== Remarks by interview subject ===
Psychiatrist Robert D. Hare is interviewed in the film, and his Psychopathy Checklist is used to characterise behavior of corporations as psychopathic in the documentary. Hare&#x27;s comments used in the film are that: In his book &quot;Snakes in Suits&quot; (2006; co-written with Paul Babiak), Hare writes that &quot;: However, in his monologue in The Corporation and the transcript of the interview, Hare, in addition to pointing out differences between corporations, clearly uses generalized terms with regard to numerous of his characterizations of psychopathy applying to corporations. He states, for example:

==Awards==
The film won or was nominated for over 26 international awards including winning the World Cinema Audience Award: Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival in 2004, a Special Jury Award at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) in 2003 and a Genie Award - Documentary in 2005.

<text>Biloela ( ) is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Banana, Central Queensland, Australia. It is the administrative centre of the shire. In the , the locality of Biloela had a population of 5,692 people.

== Geography ==
Biloela is inland from the port city of Gladstone at the junction of the Burnett and Dawson highways. Biloela is the administrative centre of the Shire of Banana, which has an area of .

== History ==
===Aboriginal history===
The town was established on what is Gangulu tribal lands. &quot;Gangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu)&quot; is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River. There was a ceremonial bora ground behind what is now the main street of Bileola and the local entombment custom was to place the skeletal remains of their dead in hollowed out burial trees which were specially marked with red ochre. Dingoes were used in the process of mustering and killing of kangaroo and emu for food.

===&quot;Prairie&quot; pastoral property===
British colonisation began in 1854 when Frederick Morton established a large squatting pastoral property in the area, which he named &quot;Prairie&quot;. This leasehold comprised around 500 square miles of land in the Callide valley and Morton built his homestead not far from the present day location of the town of Biloela. Morton initially ran Prairie as a sheep station but later it was used to farm cattle.

In 1864, Morton decided to &quot;disperse&quot; a group of Aboriginal people for the taking of some sheep. He and other local settlers, armed and mounted on horses, set off on a night-time attack on a local Aboriginal camp. The people in the camp were made aware of the oncoming horsemen and set up an ambush. Morton&#x27;s group was either warned at the last minute of the impending ambush or, according to historian John Bird, they were beaten back by the Aboriginal counter-attack and forced to retreat.

In 1873, a Native Police detachment of Alexander Douglas was accused of a massacre of an unknown number of Aboriginal people. An enquiry with several witnesses found that Douglas and his troopers had shot an Aboriginal man named Harry, who was shot while evading capture on a warrant for an &quot;outrage&quot; on a woman. The inquiry exonerated Douglas from the charge of wantonly destroying life. The local colonists signed a petition for him to conduct further patrols. An Aboriginal survivor of Douglas&#x27; raids named Etamitcham later described how as a child he and his family were chased over the Kroombit Mountains to avoid &quot;being shot down&quot;. Aboriginal people were employed on Prairie Station and they considered themselves to be &quot;well compensated&quot; by being paid with trinkets and tobacco.

In 1886, most of Prairie was subdivided and sold off, with Montague Beak coming into ownership of what remained. Prairie was then resumed by the government in 1925 and completely divided into small land selections for urban development.

===Township of Biloela===
The name &quot;Biloela&quot; is generally believed to come from an Aboriginal word (possibly from the Sydney area) for &quot;white cockatoo&quot;. The Government dockyards in Sydney were known as Biloela during 1871–1913 in an endeavour to remove the perceived stigma of the prior Cockatoo Island convict establishment.

The town was gazetted in 1924; it was on the Rannes-Monto railway line. Land sales were held in Rannes in December 1924.

Biloela Post Office opened by January 1925.

Biloela Provisional School opened on 22 June 1925 and become Biloela State School in 1928. An opportunity class commenced on 29 January 1975, becoming a special education unit in January 1979. On 4 February 1957, a secondary department was opened, closing when Biloela State High School opened on 28 January 1963.

Callide Bridge State School opened 10 June 1929 but had a number of name changes in 1929 including Melton and Raeworth before becoming Raedon State School. It closed in 1959. It was at 11 Teys Road (), now within Biloela but on the locality boundary with Dakenba.

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School was established by the Sisters of Mercy and opened on 31 January 1939. The Sisters operated the school until 1980 when the first lay principal was appointed.
The first open-cut mine was established in 1942.

In 1963, work began on the Callide Power Station.

Mean average annual precipitation is moderately low, , is highly concentrated during the summer, and is spread across 55.0 precipitation days (above the threshold). Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 18 November 1990 to on 26 July 1965.

Thangool Airport is located 13.8 km SE of Bileola. The weather station has been operational since 1929 for rainfall and 1992 for temperature.
==Industry==
Biloela and the Banana Shire, dubbed by the council as &quot;The Shire of Opportunity&quot;, has a diverse range of industries. Extensive grazing and cropping concerns are found in the area. Cotton, sorghum and wheat are grown in the area. The Callide Power Stations lie just north of the town. Coal was discovered on Callide Creek in 1891 and is now mined at the nearby Callide and Boundary Hill mines which supply the power station. The third largest abattoir in Queensland is situated in the town.

Callide is an open-cut mining operation providing low sulphur, sub-bituminous thermal coal primarily for Queensland&#x27;s domestic power generation.

== Dinosaurs ==
Dinosaur footprint fossils had been documented in the scientific literature as early as 2000, namely those attributable to ornithopod and theropod track-makers, however, no fossils were shown or described, nor specific locality data provided. Confirmation came in 2020 with the first ichnological descriptions of tracks originating from Lower Jurassic (Hettangian–Sinemurian) aged Precipice Sandstone from the Callide open-pit mine. Purportedly hundreds of small- to medium-sized three-toed tracks resembling bird footprints were observed in the overburden dumps associated with the Dunn Creek Mining area in 1998, with others noted and photographed in 2010, enough to create a virtual 3D model via photogrammetry methods. The long blunt-toed track was attributed as registered by a medium-sized &quot;Anomoepus&quot;-like &quot;Anomoepid&quot; track-maker and resembles those of ornithischian footprints found from the only other Early Jurassic Australian dinosaur fossil sites: Mount Morgan and Carnarvon Gorge, these being the first to be discovered preserved as an impression rather than as track infills.

== Callide Dam ==
The closest fresh water depository is the Callide Dam, however it is often well below capacity due to low rainfall in the area. Despite this, the dam acts as a popular site for water skiing, camping, swimming and fishing. In particular, the dam is a haven for eel-tailed catfish, yellowbelly, saratoga and barramundi. The largest barramundi recorded was at the 2008 Callide Dam fishing competition, measuring .

The Callide Dam was constructed in 1965 to supply water for a nearby power station in Biloela. Callide Dam holds at an average depth of and a surface area of at full capacity. The dam supplies water to the Callide Power Station.

In a long-running case in which a couple of Tamil asylum seekers, Kokilapathmapriya Nadesalingam (Priya) and Nadesalingam Murugappan (Nades), were refused refugee status after settling and starting a family in Biloela, the community rallied to support the family, who became known as &quot;the Biloela family&quot; in the press. The family were removed in a dawn raid on their home and taken to Melbourne in March 2018, pending deportation. Various legal avenues were subsequently pursued, with the family taken to Christmas Island Detention Centre in late August 2018. In April 2020 they were awarded costs of more than against the federal government, for lack of procedural fairness in assessing their youngest daughter&#x27;s claim.

On 26 May 2022, after a four-year campaign to allow the family to return to Biloela, the interim Minister for Home Affairs, Jim Chalmers, granted the family bridging visas to reside in Australia whilst their immigration case is resolved, fulfilling an election promise by the newly-elected Albanese government. The family returned to Biloela in early June 2022.

While Anderson&#x27;s television and radio career has made him a recognised figure in Australia, standup comedy remains his foremost discipline. Anderson started his career in newspaper journalism before venturing into standup comedy. In his early career, Anderson made numerous appearances on &quot;Good News Week&quot;, on both the original and revamped versions. On 19 June 1996, Anderson appeared as the guest comedian on the RMITV Show &quot;Under Melbourne Tonight&quot;, and appeared with RMITV again on the &quot;Under Melbourne Tonight&quot; spin-off &quot;What&#x27;s Goin&#x27; On There?&quot; on 3 June 1998.

====Live shows====
Anderson has performed at numerous festivals, including Just For Laughs in Montreal. For over a decade Anderson has started every live show with the opening riff from &quot;Back In Black&quot; as a tribute to his late friend, comedian Dave Grant. Since 1997, he has used a pun regarding his first name for the title of his live shows:

===Podcasts===
Anderson has created a number of podcasts, including &quot;TOFOP&quot;, a comedy podcast with friend and actor Charlie Clausen; &quot;FOFOP&quot;, where he chats with &quot;Guest Charlies&quot; in lieu of Clausen; &quot;Wilosophy&quot;, where he interviews guests about their life philosophies; and &quot;2 Guys 1 Cup&quot;, an Australian rules football podcast with Clausen. He has also expressed interest in starting a &quot;Survivor&quot; recap podcast entitled &quot;Outwil, Outplay, Outlast&quot;.

&quot;TOFOP&quot; (&quot;Thirty Odd Foot of Pod&quot;) debuted in 2010 as a weekly podcast in which Anderson and Clausen discussed a variety of subjects, including film, popular culture, sport, personal anecdotes, and detailed discussions on bizarre hypothetical situations. Following significant media coverage in June 2012, TOFOP rose to become the most popular comedy podcast in Australia. In September 2012, the podcast was placed on hiatus as a result of Clausen gaining a starring role as Zac MacGuire in popular Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot;. The podcast resumed in June 2014. In February 2013, Anderson launched the spin-off podcast &quot;FOFOP&quot;.

Anderson launched his &quot;Wilosophy&quot; podcast in December 2014. The inaugural episode featured Todd Sampson, while subsequent guests include Judith Lucy, John Safran, Felicity Ward, Osher Günsberg, Jarrod McKenna, Annabel Crabb, Marc Maron, Dee Madigan, Nazeem Hussain, Corinne Grant, Namila Benson and Karl Kruszelnicki. &quot;Wilosphy&quot; has, over the second half of 2018, released compilation episodes with themes such as religion, comedy and mental health. These episodes take clips from past &quot;Wilosophy&quot; episodes and compile them based on subject matter.

In a January 2015 episode of podcast &quot;TOFOP&quot;, Anderson recalled his first Logie Awards ceremony, held in 2008, when he garnered controversy for his live tweets from the event. Anderson explained that he has never been a fan of the event, as he believes that a large number of other causes for celebration exist in Australia that never receive the recognition they deserve.

In 2020, he was a guest on the podcast &quot;The West Wing Thing&quot;. Wil is also a frequent guest on &quot;The Dollop&quot; with Dave Anthony and Gareth Reynolds, having appeared in 26 episodes as of October, 2024.

=== Books ===
In 2006, Anderson published his first book: &quot;Survival of the Dumbest&quot;, a comedic collection of rants and observations drawn largely from his &#x27;Sunday Roast&#x27; columns in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Sunday Herald-Sun&quot;. This was followed by a similar book, &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, in 2009. In 2022, Anderson published &quot;I Am NOT Fine, Thanks&quot;, a political memoir and comedic reflection upon the preceding years, largely consisting of the same material as his 2022 show, &quot;Wilogical&quot;.

==Personal life==
Anderson was born in Sale, Victoria, and grew up on a dairy farm near Heyfield, Victoria. He attended Gippsland Grammar School in Sale, and later studied journalism at the University of Canberra.

Between 2011 and 2017, Anderson split his time between Australia and the U.S. He has a form of osteoarthritis, which he mentions in some of his performances.

Anderson is a passionate supporter and longtime fan club member of the Western Bulldogs, who compete in the Australian Football League. Anderson was named as a club ambassador for the 2014 season.

In September 2023, Anderson appeared on &quot;The Project&quot; to give his support for the &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum; Anderson was particularly critical of the &quot;No&quot; campaign&#x27;s underhanded strategy of appealing to ignorance.

<doc id="609009" wikidata="Q731740" url="?curid=609009" title="Wiranto">
<text>Wiranto (born 4 April 1947) is an Indonesian politician and retired army general, who is serving as the chairman of the Presidential Advisory Council, since December 2019. Previously, he was the Commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces from February 1998 to October 1999 during Indonesia&#x27;s transition from authoritarian rule to democracy, he ran unsuccessfully for President of Indonesia in 2004 and for the vice-presidency in 2009. On 27 July 2016, Wiranto was appointed Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs, replacing Luhut Binsar Panjaitan.

Wiranto played a significant role in facilitating severe human rights violations by the Indonesian army and Jakarta-backed militias, during Indonesia&#x27;s withdrawal from the occupied territory of East Timor in 1999. Both the United Nations and domestic groups have gathered evidence on this, but he continues to deny the charges. In January 2000, an Indonesian commission placed general responsibility for these injustices on Wiranto. In May 2004, the United Nations-backed Special Panels of the Dili District Court indicted Wiranto and charged him with war crimes. Wiranto claimed the move was an effort to discredit his political ambitions.

Some claim that Wiranto played a key role as a moderating influence during the turbulent times of 1998 when Suharto resigned. He had the power to impose military rule, but refused to do so, thereby allowing the civilian process to develop. Taufik Darusman labeled him a &quot;military reformist&quot; because Wiranto reduced the military&#x27;s role in Indonesian politics. He initiated the reduction of their seats in parliament and separated the police from the military. Nonetheless, more than 2,000 East Timorese were killed in violence under his watch, as well as 500,000 forced into displacement. The security forces of Indonesia also perpetrated the Biak massacre in July 1998 , when Wiranto was the Minister of Defense of Indonesia.
==Early life, family, and education==
===Early life and family===
Wiranto was born on April 4, 1947, in Yogyakarta to R.S. Wirowijoto, a primary school teacher and Suwarsijah. He was the sixth out of nine children. Only one month old, Wiranto and his family moved from Yogyakarta to Boyolali near Surakarta for safety reasons as the Dutch were planning to launch an attack on Yogyakarta. At Surakarta, Wiranto completed his primary and secondary education.

===Education===
When he was a child, Wiranto dreamed of a military career, but as he grew up, he developed the desire to become an architect. However, training to become an architect was not feasible financially, so Wiranto decided to join the Indonesian Military Academy in Magelang in Central Java, now known as &quot;Akademi Militer&quot; or &quot;Akmil&quot;.

==Military career==

===Early career===
Wiranto graduated from the Indonesian Military Academy in 1968 and spent the early part of his military career in North Sulawesi, far from the centers of power in Indonesia. There he worked his way up from being a Platoon Commander to a Battalion Commander in 1982. From there he worked in the Armed Forces headquarters (formerly known as ABRI HQ, or headquarters of the &quot;Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia&quot;) for two years before joining the high-profile Kostrad (a corp-level and well-equipped command within the Indonesian armed forces) in 1985 as a Brigade Chief of Staff in East Java. In 1987, he was transferred to Jakarta where he became Deputy Operations Assistant to the Kostrad Chief of Staff.

===Aide-de-camp to Suharto===
In 1989, his career had a major break when he was selected to become an aide-de-camp to President Suharto. The position of presidential aide-de-camp was a prestigious one during the New Order, as it became a launching pad for officers to have successful military careers. By Wiranto&#x27;s own accounts, 2 Army Commanders, 3 Armed Services Chiefs of Staff, and 2 Chiefs of Police, had served as presidential aide-de-camp during their career.

===Chief of Staff===
In 1993, Wiranto became Chief of Staff in the Jakarta regional military command (&quot;Komando Daerah Militer&quot; for Jakarta, or &quot;KODAM Jaya&quot;) and became commander of KODAM Jaya in 1994. Two years later, he became commander of Kostrad and in 1997, was appointed Army Chief of Staff. At this stage of his career, it was speculated that Wiranto, together with Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Agum Gumelar, A.M. Hendropriyono, and Farid Zainuddin were the top five officers from ABRI&#x27;s secular/Nationalist &quot;Red and White&quot; faction.

===Fall of Suharto===

Wiranto&#x27;s appointment as Commander of ABRI in February 1998 came at a crucial time. Indonesia was suffering from the effects of the Asian Financial Crisis and there was widespread opposition to Suharto. Nevertheless, Suharto was re-elected for a seventh term as president by the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR) as the situation continued to deteriorate. In Suharto&#x27;s new Cabinet, Wiranto was named as the Minister of Defense and Security.

As the situation worsened, Wiranto tried to calm the situation down through dialogue. On 18 April 1998, together with 17 ministers, Wiranto held a meeting with prominent members of society and student organizations. Wiranto took a cautious stance towards the social unrest that was brewing around Indonesia at the time and warned against it descending into anarchy.

Wiranto&#x27;s involvement with the events of May 1998 began by ordering most senior military commanders to go to Malang in East Java (850 km from Jakarta) for a ceremonial party, during the riot in the capital Jakarta. Later he authorized Commander of KODAM Jaya Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin and Chief of Jakarta Regional Police Hamami Nata to take care of the situation in Jakarta. That was the day when four students of Trisakti University were shot dead. Wiranto responded on 13 May by ordering the Military Police to mobilize. Wiranto also sensed that the condition was about to spiral out of control and ordered reinforcements in the form of Marines and Kostrad personnel.

On 15 May, Wiranto met with Suharto who had gone to Egypt to attend an economic summit but was forced to come back to attend to the situation back home. Suharto brought up the idea of reinstating the Command for the Restoration of Security and Order (&quot;Kopkamtib&quot;) to deal with the situation. Finally, on 18 May, Suharto issued a Presidential Instruction (&quot;Instruksi Presiden No 16/1968&quot;) to Wiranto. Wiranto was to be made Commander of the National Alertness and Safety Operation Command (KOPKKN). This presidential instruction has been compared to the Supersemar, a key letter of authority which former president Sukarno issued in March 1966 providing the then-Major General Suharto with wide authority over government in Indonesia. Suharto&#x27;s Presidential Instruction in May 1998 was seen as providing Wiranto with wide authority to choose whether to use his new power or not.

On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation as president. Vice President BJ Habibie took over as president. Wiranto took the opportunity to state that ABRI would be ensuring the personal safety of the now former President Suharto and his family. Wiranto subsequently admitted the involvement of Kopassus special forces in the 1997–98 activists kidnappings in Indonesia.

===Habibie presidency===
Wiranto was retained as both the Commander of ABRI and Minister of Defense and Security in Habibie&#x27;s Cabinet. He immediately began working towards reforming ABRI and on 11 June, gave to Habibie and Head of People&#x27;s Representative Council/MPR Chairman Harmoko a manifesto entitled &quot;The Fundamentals of ABRI&#x27;s Philosophy on Reform Towards Achieving the National Goal&quot;. In August, Wiranto made a move to appease the people of Aceh by withdrawing the status of Military Operations Region (DOM) from the Province.

The Special Session of the MPR was held in November 1998 and Wiranto cracked down on protesters who were against the Special Session, killing 8 and injuring 226. Despite this setback, Wiranto continued to build an image as a reformer. In January 1999, he met with reformist leaders and in April 1999, supervised the establishment of the Republic of Indonesia Police (POLRI) as an autonomous entity rather than subordinate to ABRI. ABRI also went through a name change and became known as TNI. Wiranto also supervised security during the 1999 Legislative Elections during which TNI and POLRI adopted a neutral role rather than support Golkar as had been the case during Suharto&#x27;s regime. As Commander of TNI, Wiranto was also involved with the withdrawal of troops from East Timor when the Province voted to become an independent nation. In the process he became accused of being behind or at least condoned the human rights abuses committed by TNI soldiers during the retreat from Timor.

===1999 MPR General Session===
Much like the 1999 legislative election, Wiranto was in charge of security at the 1999 MPR General Session. However, he would soon become involved in the politics. Habibie, who had been nominated for re-election by Golkar chose Wiranto to become his vice president. However, Habibie&#x27;s accountability speech was rejected by the MPR and he chose not to run for president again. Nevertheless, Wiranto continued on as vice presidential candidate, this time with Akbar Tandjung as Golkar&#x27;s presidential candidate. However, Akbar would withdraw from the race and throw his support behind eventual President Abdurrahman Wahid. Wiranto finally withdrew from the vice presidential race when it became evident that Megawati needed to become vice president to appease her supporters who were angered by Megawati losing out on the Presidency.

==Political career==

===Wahid presidency===
As part of his effort to name a Cabinet which included all elements of Indonesian politics, Wahid included Wiranto in the Cabinet as Coordinating Minister of Politics and Security. Wiranto was only in his position for three months when in January 2000, Wahid called for Wiranto to step down from his position on an overseas trip to Europe. It appeared as if the President saw Wiranto as an obstacle to his plan to reform the military and that he took the human rights abuses allegations seriously. Wiranto waited until Wahid returned before meeting with the President to argue his case. Wiranto seemed to have succeeded when Wahid decided to continue to keep him on but changed his mind during the same day and Wiranto was removed from the Cabinet.

===Megawati presidency===
In January 2003, President Megawati was forced to raise the prices of fuel, electricity, and telephone. Anti-Megawati protests were then held and it was suspected that Wiranto might have been involved in masterminding the demonstrations.

===Human rights indictment===
On 24 February 2003, the Special Panels of the Dili District Court indicted Wiranto and charged him with crimes against humanity.
However, prosecutor-general of East Timor, Longuinhos Monteiro, withdrew support for the indictment claiming there &quot;might be some defects&quot;. East Timor sources believe Monteiro reversed his position following heavy pressure from senior figures in East Timor&#x27;s Government.

The warrant was never forwarded to Interpol.

===Presidential candidate===
In August 2003, Wiranto made the decision to run for president after he declared his intentions to participate in the Golkar National Convention. Wiranto&#x27;s opponents for the convention were Akbar, Prabowo, Aburizal Bakrie, Surya Paloh, Jusuf Kalla, Sultan Hamengkubuwono X, and Nurcholish Madjid. By April 2004, the month of the National Convention, Hamengkubuwono X and Nurcolish had withdrawn from the race whilst Kalla left Golkar to become Yudhoyono&#x27;s running mate. On 20 April 2004, the Golkar National Convention was held. In the first round of voting, Wiranto came second to Akbar with 137 votes to 147 votes. In the second round, Wiranto decisively won against Akbar with 315 votes to 227 votes and became Golkar&#x27;s Presidential Candidate.

As his running mate, Wiranto chose Solahuddin Wahid, the brother of former President Wahid. The selection of Solahuddin was to improve Wiranto&#x27;s image with regards to human rights. According to Wiranto &quot;Because Gus Solah (Solahuddin&#x27;s nickname) is a clean figure, of course he would not associate himself with dirty goods. Especially when he&#x27;s the Vice-Chairman of the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM). So I&#x27;m clean.&quot; In addition to Golkar, Wiranto also drew support from Wahid who mobilized both his National Awakening Party (PKB) and the Nadhlatul Ulama (NU) to Wiranto&#x27;s cause.

On Election Day 5 July 2004, Wiranto and Solahuddin came third behind Yudhoyono/Kalla and Megawati/Hasyim Muzadi with 22.19% of the votes.

===Yudhoyono presidency===
In the lead up to the 2004 Golkar National Congress, Wiranto became one of the candidates for the position of Chairman. However, the situation soon changed when Kalla, now Vice President, participated in the contest to become Chairman with the support of President Yudhoyono. Wiranto was not happy because according to him, Yudhoyono would not do anything to block Wiranto from becoming Chairman. Wiranto then chose to align himself with his former opponent Akbar. However the two failed and Kalla became the new Chairman.

In August 2005, Wiranto, together with former Presidents Wahid and Megawati, former Vice President Try Sutrisno, and Akbar met to discuss and criticize the policies of the Yudhoyono Government. On 1 September, they signed an official statement and called themselves the United Awakened Archipelago Coalition (&quot;Koalisi Nusantara Bangkit Bersatu&quot;).

The next month in September 2005, Wiranto joined the Nationhood Union, a mass organization which was created by former Golkar member Marwah Daud Ibrahim. At the organization&#x27;s National Leadership Meeting in May 2006, Wiranto said that the organization was a way to test the waters en route to forming a new political party. Finally on 22 December 2006, Wiranto declared the formation of the People&#x27;s Conscience Party (Hanura) and was elected as its first Chairman.

===Vice-presidential candidate===
Wiranto ran unsuccessfully for the vice-presidency as Jusuf Kalla&#x27;s running mate in the 2009 Indonesian presidential election.

===Joko Widodo presidency===

Wiranto in July 2013 announced he would run for the presidency in 2014 with media tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo as his running mate, but after Hanura&#x27;s poor performance in the 2014 general election, Wiranto opted to support the presidential bid of Joko Widodo, who was victorious.

When Jokowi reshuffled his cabinet on 27 July 2016, Wiranto was appointed Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs. In December 2016, Wiranto said Hanura would support Jokowi for re-election in 2019. In 2018, Wiranto urged the Corruption Eradication Commission to postpone naming regional election candidates suspected of involvement in corruption cases.

====Knife attack====
On 10 October 2019, Wiranto was stabbed twice by a man allegedly affiliated with the Islamic State-linked militant group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). The attack occurred when Wiranto was exiting a car near the small town of Saketi, south of the main town of Pandeglang in Pandeglang Regency in Banten province, around 100 km southwest of Jakarta. Wiranto survived and was flown by helicopter to the Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital in Jakarta, where he underwent surgery. Three other people, including a police officer, were stabbed and wounded while attempting to protect Wiranto and apprehend the assailant.

After treatment, Wiranto&#x27;s condition was stable and improved. President Joko Widodo visited him twice and said that, &quot;(He) told me he wants to go home and join the limited Cabinet meeting soon.&quot; A range of other Indonesian leaders and senior officials visited Wiranto in hospital including vice-president Jusuf Kalla, state intelligence agency head Budi Gunawan, former coordinating minister for political, legal and security affairs Tedjo Edhy Purdijatno, and presidential advisory board member Agum Gumelar.

The attacker, identified as Syahrial Alamsyah alias Abu Rara, was apprehended at the scene, along with his wife, Fitria Diana (20), who stabbed a local sub-district police chief, Commissioner Dariyanto, in the back. Abu Rara said he was not part of a terror cell and he only decided to make the attack when he heard a helicopter and found out the Wiranto was visiting. Authorities said Abu Rara had previously been under observation because of his collection of knives. While officials said the attacker was believed to a member of JAD, some conservative Muslim politicians claimed the attack was staged, such as Hanum Rais (daughter of Muslim leader Amien Rais). Harits Abu Ulya, a spokesman for a group called the Community of Ideological Islamic Analyst (CIIA), claimed Wiranto himself was partly to blame for the attack because the minister&#x27;s statements had hurt people&#x27;s feelings.

====Chairperson of Presidential Advisory Council====
After Jokowi was sworn in for a second five-year term in October 2019, Wiranto—still recovering from the knife attack—lost his cabinet position, but by December 2019 he had recovered and was appointed to lead the nine-member Presidential Advisory Council. Due to party neutrality requirement to become the chairperson of the council, Wiranto left Hanura automatically per se.

==Personal life==
Wiranto has been married to Rugaiya Usman (Uga) since 1975. She is active in her role as, among others, Head of Indonesian Red Cross of Jakarta Chapter. The couple has three children: Lia, Maya, and Zainal. Zainal died of an undisclosed illness in May 2013 in South Africa, where he had recently begun pursuing Islamic studies.

On October 10, 2019, Wiranto was stabbed with a sharp weapon by a man in Menes Square, Pandeglang, Banten. As a result, Wiranto suffered a stab wound to the front of his body. Apart from Wiranto, the attack injured the Head of the Sector Police, Menes Commissary Police Dariyanto, who was at the location. Wiranto&#x27;s men were also injured in the attack. The suspect is Syahril Alamsyah, alias Abu Rara, born in Medan on August 24, 1968, and a woman who is suspected to be with the perpetrator on behalf of Fitri Andriana, born in Brebes on May 5, 1998, was arrested. The head of the Public Information Bureau of the National Police Headquarters Brigadier General Dedi Prasetyo said the two perpetrators of the attack on Wiranto were suspected of being exposed to Islamic State radicalism and after the incident, he had to be rushed to the nearest hospital for first aid and referred to Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, Jakarta.

== Cases ==
=== Controversy and allegations of human rights violations ===
Wiranto has been accused of being involved in war crimes in East Timor in 1999. Together with five other military officers suspected of being involved, Wiranto has been accused by the International Court of Justice of having a role in the 1999 East Timorese crisis that occurred around the time of the East Timorese sovereignty referendum.

The Indonesian human rights courts refused to investigate the officers and police officers that had been accused of being involved in human rights violations during the end of the Indonesian occupation. The refusal to prosecute is considered to have undermined the existing evidence. Wiranto and the five other officers are on the list of suspected war criminals and barred from entering the United States.

United Nations prosecutors have advised the government of East Timor to issue an international arrest warrant for the former general, however none was ever issued. Nicholas Koumjian, a United Nations prosecutor from the Special Serious Criminal Court in Dili said Wiranto should be held responsible for the 1999 violence. He also said that Wiranto had failed to carry out his responsibilities as the leader of the military and police forces in East Timor to prevent crimes against humanity and failed to punish the perpetrators of these crimes.

<text>Edgar Purnell Hooley (5 June 1860 – 26 January 1942) was a Welsh inventor. After inventing tarmac in 1902, he founded Tar Macadam Syndicate Ltd the following year and registered tarmac as a trademark. Following a merger in 2013 the business became Tarmac Limited, one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest building materials companies.

==Career==
Born in Swansea, Hooley was articled as a civil engineer to the firm of James Craik in Bristol.

Hooley entered a business partnership with Francis Lean, as architects and surveyors at Neath, then in the county of Glamorgan, under the name of &quot;Lean and Hooley&quot;. The partnership was dissolved on 27 August 1881. Also in 1881, he became surveyor with Stow-on-the-Wold Highway Board and in 1884 he took up a similar position with the Maidstone Highway Board. He was appointed county surveyor to Nottinghamshire County Council in 1889.

In his capacity as county surveyor, Hooley was passing a tarworks in 1901 when he noticed that a barrel of tar had been spilled on the roadway and that, in an attempt to reduce the mess, someone had dumped gravel on top of it. The area was remarkably dust-free compared to the surrounding road, and it inspired Hooley to develop tarmac in Britain. Hooley applied for a patent for tarmac in 1902 (GB 7796), which was granted in 1903.

He called his company, which he registered in 1903, &quot;Tar Macadam (Purnell Hooley&#x27;s Patent) Syndicate Limited&quot;, but unfortunately he had trouble selling his product as he was not an experienced businessman. On 26 July 1904, Hooley obtained a US patent for an &quot;apparatus for the preparation of tar macadam&quot;, intended as an improvement to existing methods of preparing tar macadam.

Hooley&#x27;s company was bought out by the Wolverhampton MP, Sir Alfred Hickman, who was also the owner of a steelworks which produced large quantities of waste slag. The Tarmac company was relaunched by Hickman in 1905.

Hooley also undertook some military service, attaining the rank of second lieutenant in the 1st Nottinghamshire (Robin Hood) battalion on 12 March 1892, then lieutenant on 23 June 1894, and captain on 23 December 1896.

He resigned this commission on 26 March 1902. On 7 October 1914, Hooley transferred from the Territorial Force Reserve to the &quot;8th Battalion, of The Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)&quot; with the rank of Quartermaster and Honorary Captain. He subsequently transferred back to the Territorial Force Reserve. On 29 October 1920, Hooley attained the age limit for retirement, and retired, retaining the rank of Quartermaster and Captain.

Hooley died at his home in Oxford, England in 1942.

==Family==
In 1884 Hooley married Matilda Fanny Stallard and together they went on to have two sons and two daughters, one of whom lived to be a centenarian.

<text>:

Greenville is a town in Piscataquis County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,437 at the 2020 census. The town is centered on the lower end of Moosehead Lake, the largest body of fresh water in the state. Greenville is the historic gateway to the north country and a center for outdoor recreation in the area. Greenville High School, with 89 students, was ranked as the third best high school in Maine and one of the top 1,000 in the US in 2010.

==History==

First called T9 R10 NWP (or Township 9, Range 10, North of the Waldo Patent), the land was granted about 1812 by the Massachusetts General Court to Thornton Academy in Saco. In 1824, Nathaniel Haskell of Westbrook bought the Thornton Academy Grant. With Oliver Young and John Smith, he began clearing trees that summer for farming near Wilson Pond, where the Wilson Stream would provide water power for mills.

In 1827, Haskell completed a house, and his family joined him. A sawmill was built on Wilson Stream in 1829, with a gristmill added the following year. In 1835, Henry Gower began clearing land beside Moosehead Lake for what would develop into Greenville village. There he erected the first hotel, a two-story building called The Seboomook House, and the first store. On February 6, 1836, Greenville was incorporated from Haskell Plantation, and named for its green forests. By 1846, Greenville village included two houses, two blacksmith shops and a schoolhouse. On August 10, 1848, the town annexed land from Wilson, the remainder of which was distributed to Shirley and Elliotsville.

A small steamboat was launched in 1836 to tow logs, and in 1838 the first large lake steamer began operation. In later years, a succession of steamers by the name of &quot;Katahdin&quot; plied the waters. The current &quot;S/S Katahdin&quot; was built in 1914. In July 1884, the Bangor and Piscataquis Railroad (later, the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad) arrived at Greenville Junction. The Canadian Pacific Railway&#x27;s subsidiary the International Railway of Maine was built through the village in 1888. Tourists were attracted by the region&#x27;s scenic beauty, hunting and fishing. Consequently, several inns and hotels were built, including the Piscataquis Exchange Hotel, the Squaw Mountain Inn and the Moosehead Inn. Steamboat service was available across Moosehead Lake to the grand Mount Kineo House on a peninsula at Mount Kineo. Today, Greenville remains a popular resort area.

Greenville was in the path of totality of the total eclipse that occurred on April 8th, 2024.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Situated beside Moosehead Lake, Greenville is drained by Wilson Stream.

<text>David Cecil MacAlister Tomlinson (7 May 1917 – 24 June 2000) was an English stage, film and television actor, singer and comedian. Having been described as both a leading man and a character actor, he is primarily remembered for his roles with The Walt Disney Company as authoritarian father figure George Banks in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, fraudulent magician Professor Emelius Browne in &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; and as hapless antagonist Peter Thorndyke in &quot;The Love Bug&quot;. Tomlinson was posthumously inducted as a Disney Legend in 2002.

==Early life==
David Cecil McAlister Tomlinson was born in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on 7 May 1917, the son of Clarence Samuel Tomlinson (1883–1978), a well-respected London solicitor, and Florence Elizabeth, née Sinclair-Thomson (1890–1986). He attended Tonbridge School and left to join the Grenadier Guards for 16 months. His father then secured him a job as a clerk at Shell Mex House.

His stage career grew from amateur stage productions to his 1940 film debut in &quot;Quiet Wedding&quot;. His career was interrupted when he entered Second World War service as a Flight Lieutenant in the RAF. During the war, he learned to fly in Canada and was assigned as a flying instructor in the UK, while also appearing in three more films. He continued flying after the war. On one occasion, a Tiger Moth plane he was piloting crashed into woodland near his back garden after he lost consciousness while performing aerobatics.

==Film career==
Tomlinson played Philip Rowe, one of the three British airmen escaping from a German POW camp, in the 1950 British Film &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;.

Tomlinson played the role of George Banks, head of the Banks family, in the Disney film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964). Tomlinson continued work with Disney, appearing in &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1968) and &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971). Throughout the rest of Tomlinson&#x27;s film career, he never steered far from comedies. His final acting appearance was in &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot; (1980), which was also the final film of Peter Sellers. Tomlinson retired from acting at age 63 to spend more time with his family. However, in 1992, at the age of 75, he appeared on the &quot;Wogan&quot; talk show along with Tommy Cockles.

She had been widowed in 1941 when her husband, Major Armand Guy Hiddingh, was killed in action, leaving her to care for their two young sons. Tomlinson married Mary in New York in September 1943, but on 2 December 1943, she killed herself and her two sons in a murder–suicide by jumping from a hotel in New York City, after learning that she could not take her two sons with her to join Tomlinson in England until WWII ended.

Tomlinson&#x27;s second wife was actress Audrey Freeman (born 12 November 1931), whom he married on 17 May 1953, and the couple remained together for 47 years until his death. They had four sons: David Jr., William, Henry, and James.

Tomlinson died peacefully in his sleep at King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital, Westminster, at on 24 June 2000, after suffering a stroke. He was 83 years old. He was interred at his estate grounds in Mursley, Buckinghamshire. Tomlinson had joked that he wanted &quot;actor of genius, irresistible to women&quot; as an epitaph.

=== Former members which are now subdivision ===
The German Red Cross (DRK) was founded in 1921, bringing together various independent Red Cross associations that had previously operated autonomously within the German states. These regional branches trace their origins back to the former independent members of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Examples include the Badisches Rotes Kreuz, Bayerisches Rotes Kreuz, and the regional associations of Bremen, Hamburg, Oldenburg, Hesse, and Berlin. Some current subdivisions are direct continuations of these earlier organizations, while others resulted from mergers or divisions of the former members.

<doc id="609030" wikidata="Q7152327" url="?curid=609030" title="Paul McDermott">
<text>Paul Anthony Michael McDermott (born 13 May 1962) is an Australian entertainer, best known both for &quot;Good News Week&quot; and for his role as a member of the musical comedy group the Doug Anthony All Stars. He has frequently appeared at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and taken part in its two major televised productions, the Comedy Festival Gala and the Great Debate. McDermott has also performed and written numerous shows as a solo performer and authored children’s books and newspaper articles and directed short animated films.

==Personal life==
McDermott was born in Adelaide, South Australia, a fraternal twin and one of six children in a Catholic family. His father, John, was a senior public servant and his mother, Betty, a home manager. The family moved to Canberra when McDermott was three. He attended Marist College Canberra, where he describes himself as having been painfully shy and a &quot;bit of a loner&quot;; Dickson College; and the Canberra School of Art at the Australian National University, where he studied art for four years. He describes painting as his first love, and still considers his final year piece at art school to be his finest work. Indeed, he only started performing at the age of 25 because he needed money to buy canvases. &quot;It was either that or waiting on tables and I thought I&#x27;d soon get pissed off with people doing that,&quot; he says. Privately, McDermott maintains his interest in art through painting, drawing and hand-crafting books. He works under the alias of artist &#x27;Young Master Paul&#x27;.

He has criticised the war on drugs and society&#x27;s tendency to ignore the large drug subculture that involves people of all ages. &quot;It&#x27;s out there and it happens, but there&#x27;s still a fear of talking about it,&quot; he says. &quot;In cities like Manchester, with unemployment problems, there are no-alcohol venues where five thousand people under the age of sixteen are eccy&#x27;d off their heads every Saturday night.&quot;

He has one son with his partner Melissa Lyne. He is also the first cousin of retired Adelaide Crows AFL footballer and current Adelaide media personality Chris McDermott.

==Career==
===Doug Anthony All Stars===

 The Doug Anthony All Stars were a singing comedy trio (comprising McDermott, Tim Ferguson and Richard Fidler) who began busking in Canberra in the 1980s and later gained notoriety at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. This led to regular appearances on ABC TV’s The Big Gig, where they gained a strong following. Their innovative, brash style broke down many taboos of the time, and many Australian comedians have described DAAS as being their inspiration for wanting to become comedians. McDermott took lead vocals on most songs and wrote much of the material. The group also starred in their own spin off TV show called DAAS Kapital. They broke up in 1995 but later reformed with new guitarist Paul Livingston (replacing Fidler) in 2014 for a series of live shows.

McDermott began busking in 1985, which he says equipped him with useful experience and the ability to cope with most situations when he later started performing in clubs. He joined a group called Gigantic Fly which performed at a new Canberra club called Cafe Boom Boom. It was here that he got to know Tim Ferguson and Richard Fidler of the musical comedy group the Doug Anthony All Stars (DAAS). McDermott was asked to join the group when the third member, Robert Piper, left due to other commitments. His primary reason for joining, he says, was monetary: &quot;I&#x27;d been stealing canvas from the bins around the art school.&quot; Initially busking and performing live in clubs, with McDermott writing the majority of their material and songs, DAAS achieved success at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival and subsequently travelled to Britain for the Edinburgh Fringe festival, where they were nominated for the Perrier Award. They toured both nationally and internationally, appearing on British television and playing at the opening of the Barcelona Olympics. After initially struggling to gain success in Australia, in 1989 DAAS was picked up to perform on the ABC show &quot;The Big Gig&quot;, on which they became a popular feature. They appeared frequently on the show until 1991, when the group premiered their own series on the ABC, &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot;, which ran for two seasons. McDermott says that he liked performing with DAAS because it allowed him to bring together a range of his interests—he got to write, perform, sing, create costumes and paint backdrops.

The group split up in 1995 after a final farewell tour of Australia. Rumours of a falling out among the trio persisted for many years, but all three maintained that they had parted on good terms and that it had simply been time to move on, as they had wanted to pursue careers in different directions. Ferguson has since revealed that the break-up was in large part due to his being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1995. In the two years following the break-up of DAAS, McDermott wrote two film scripts and the stage show &quot;MOSH!&quot;. He says that he was not particularly interested in returning to comedy, which he came to regard as an &quot;aberration, something that had been good to do for eight years but now it was over,&quot; until in 1996 he was recruited as host of the satirical news-based quiz show &quot;Good News Week&quot;.

In 2014, McDermott and Tim Ferguson reunited to tour Australia as the Doug Anthony All Stars, with frequent collaborator Paul Livingston (also known as &quot;Flacco&quot;) replacing Richard Fidler as guitarist due to Fidler&#x27;s radio commitments.

===Television career===
In 1996, McDermott was given the role of hosting the ABC&#x27;s new topical comedy game show &quot;Good News Week&quot;. The show was notable for being one of the first in Australia to feature an introductory comedic monologue about the week&#x27;s events, delivered by McDermott. McDermott&#x27;s monologues also broke new ground in Australian TV for their direct and harsh criticisms of prominent figures, especially politicians. The ABC received a large number of complaints about McDermott for making light of tragic events, use of profanity and drug references, but his willingness to push boundaries was also the reason for his popularity. McDermott would then introduce the two teams of comedians, artists and politicians including team captains Mikey Robbins and Julie McCrossin. This was one of the earliest panel comedy shows on Australian TV and was notable for ensuring gender balance as early as the mid 1990s.

In 1998, McDermott hosted a spin-off called &quot;Good News Weekend&quot;, which followed a similar format, but with questions based around pop culture. Most episodes finished with McDermott singing a non-comedic song with house band the Gadflys. Many of these songs were cover versions, but his original song &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot; was released as a single and charted in the JJJ Hottest 100. In 1999, both programs moved to Channel Ten, which renamed Good News Weekend as Good News Week Nite Lite. During this time, McDermott&#x27;s popularity led to him being given roles as the host of significant Australian award shows including the ARIAs and the AFI Awards. Good News Week was terminated in 2000.

In 2004, McDermott hosted the ABCTV dancing competition &quot;Strictly Dancing&quot;, which was notable for featuring same-sex dancing partners.

In 2007, McDermott hosted ABC variety program &quot;The Sideshow&quot;. Each episode began with a monologue similar in style to McDermott&#x27;s &quot;Good News Week&quot; monologues. The show was notable for introducing Australian TV audiences to a broad range of cabaret and circus acts while also featuring popular comedians and musicians. Most episodes finished with McDermott singing an original non-comedic song.

In 2008, Channel Ten relaunched Good News Week with McDermott as host. McDermott was nominated for the 2010 Gold Logie award for his hosting role.

In 2015, McDermott hosted SBS interview program &quot;Room 101&quot;. In 2018, he hosted ABC game show &quot;Think Tank&quot;.

====&quot;Good News Week&quot;====

In 1996, McDermott was recruited by director Ted Robinson, with whom he had previously worked on &quot;The Big Gig&quot;, to host &quot;Good News Week&quot;, which aired on the ABC from 1996 to 1998, and on Network Ten from 1999 to 2000 and then returned in 2008 for a new series. McDermott hosted &quot;Good News Week&quot; from 1996 until its cancellation in 2000, as well as its two spinoffs, &quot;Good News Weekend&quot; (1998) and &quot;GNW Night Lite&quot; (1999), and reprised this role when the series returned in 2008. A comedic quiz show with a similar format to that of the British program &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, it features two teams, with two permanent captains and four guests, competing to answer questions based on recent news events. McDermott opens each show with a humorous monologue based on the news on the week and is responsible for posing questions and awarding points to teams. &quot;I&#x27;m sort of judge, jury and executioner,&quot; he says of his role. The show premiered on the ABC, but moved to Network Ten in 1999.

The ABC was initially apprehensive about Robinson&#x27;s choice of McDermott as host. He had dreadlocks at the time, and was best known for the crude, aggressive &quot;bad boy&quot; character he had played in the Doug Anthony All Stars, which many tended to confuse with his actual personality. In addition, it was doubted that he was capable of ad libbing and speaking well, as in past interviews he had usually allowed his fellow band members to do most of the talking. McDermott cut off his dreadlocks for the show and succeeded in broadening his appeal by showing a gentler, more charming side as host. He has said that although he feels there are still elements of his more aggressive character in &quot;Good News Week&quot;, they are &quot;toned down... I&#x27;ve got to be the generous host now, spin-the-wheel sort of thing. I&#x27;m basing myself on Mike Brady now. I&#x27;m the disciplinarian.&quot;

He would regularly sing on the program, particularly on &quot;Good News Weekend&quot; and &quot;GNW Night Lite&quot;, including some of his own original songs. In one episode, McDermott performed the self-penned &quot;Shut Up and Kiss Me&quot; as a duet with Fiona Horne. It was met with such a warm reception from viewers that it was eventually released as a single. Some of his other musical performances from the series are featured on the CD &quot;Good News Week Tapes Volume 2&quot;, and a collection of his monologues from the start of the show appear on &quot;Good News Week Tapes Volume 1&quot;.

McDermott expressed his relief when the show was cancelled in 2000, saying that he could not have maintained the relentless production schedule for much longer. &quot;I&#x27;m just so tired, I don&#x27;t feel I have been human for five years,&quot; he said. Network Ten had initially intended only to bring back &quot;Good News Week&quot; as a one-off special, but decided to expand it after the short supply of US shows resulting from the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike caused the network to take an interest in developing more local programs. The revived series premiered on 11 February 2008 with McDermott reprising his role as host.

In 2010, McDermott was nominated for a Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television.

====Other TV work====
He hosted the AFI awards in 2002, and in 2004 and 2005 presented the ABC show &quot;Strictly Dancing&quot;. McDermott reunited with Robinson in 2007 when he was named host of a new ABC variety program, &quot;The Sideshow&quot;, a show described as a successor to &quot;The Big Gig&quot;. It premiered on 21 April 2007, and quickly built a strong cult audience. However, due in part to poor programming, the show did not rate well and was cancelled after its initial run of 26 episodes. McDermott says he was saddened by &quot;The Sideshow&quot;″s cancellation as he believed it was an excellent venue for performers of alternative work which would have achieved ratings success if it had been allowed to continue.

McDermott returned to regular television hosting in July 2015 as the host of Room 101, an Australian version of the long running British TV show of the same name, airing on SBS One. In 2018, McDermott returned to the ABC as presenter of quiz show &quot;Think Tank&quot;.

===Live comedy===
At the end of the Doug Anthony All Stars, McDermott briefly wrote and performed a show called MOSH, which featured a cappella songs with many lyrics about drug use and won best show at the Adelaide Fringe Festival.

Following the end of Good News Week in 2000, McDermott returned to live comedy and music with a trio called GUD, which toured major Australian cities. The group featured Mick Moriarty, who McDermott had collaborated with on Good News Week, and Cameron Bruce, who he later collaborated with on the Sideshow. Their songs were mostly about topical issues and allowed McDermott to push boundaries further than he had been able to on TV by extensive use of profanity and mockery of tragic events.

Following the end of the relaunched Good News Week in 2011, McDermott toured Australia in shows called Paul Sings, which featured non-comedic songs from his previous TV appearances and humorous stories about McDermott&#x27;s time in the entertainment industry.

In 2013, he wrote and performed a show called The Dark Garden. The show featured non-comedic songs with increasingly dark lyrics dealing with mortality, following the death of several of his friends. The songs were interspersed with comedic material in which McDermott spoke about his experiences in the entertainment industry, reflections on global politics and banter with the audience.

In 2014, McDermott reunited with Tim Ferguson for a relaunched Doug Anthony All Stars, with new guitarist Paul Livingston. The group performed a combination of old material and new comedic material about their experiences of ageing, including the impacts of Ferguson&#x27;s multiple sclerosis.

In 2019, McDermott teamed up with Steven Gates from music comedy trio Tripod for a series of live shows called Paul McDermott and Gatesy Live. They released an independent EP called the Bloody Lovelies. Their songs were a mix of comedic songs and non-comedic songs, once again interspersed with comedic material.

In 2021, McDermott teamed up with guitarist Glenn Moorhouse for a series of shows called Paul McDermott Plus One. The pair initially began performing online during Covid lockdowns, but later performed live. They released an EP called I&#x27;ve Seen the Future and You&#x27;re Not In It.

McDermott describes his performance style as &quot;in your face and unapologetic, grotesque, offensive, loud. But it&#x27;s all essentially me with the amp turned up—I don&#x27;t own that many great acting skills.&quot; He has stated that he does not consider any subject out of bounds in terms of comedy, which is &quot;one of [his] problems&quot;. &quot;I honestly believe you can make a joke about anything if you have something to say,&quot; he says. &quot;It really depends on the motivation... The moral objective, I suppose.&quot; He is interested in topical humour and targets issues about which he feels passionately, including the detainment of David Hicks, the AWB scandal, torture and the War on Terror.

In 1995 he wrote, directed and performed in a stage show entitled &quot;MOSH!&quot;, which he says is based on &quot;my drug-addled observations when I&#x27;ve been abusing substances&quot;. &quot;MOSH!&quot; received a range of responses; it won the award for best fringe show at the Adelaide festival and was described by one reviewer as &quot;often hilarious&quot;, but was savaged by other critics as being &quot;gratuitously offensive&quot;. Columbia Artists expressed interest in the show, but after nearly a decade of international travel with the Doug Anthony All Stars, McDermott did not wish to go to New York to do an off-Broadway show.

He reappeared in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival from 2002 with Cameron Bruce and Mick Moriarty in a music-based comedy trio called GUD. The group uses topical humour in its music; their act includes songs about Osama bin Laden, the transportation of live animal stock and what they describe as contemporary Australian &quot;folk heroes&quot; such as Chopper Read, Rene Rivkin and convicted serial killer Ivan Milat. McDermott says that GUD is in a similar vein to the Doug Anthony All Stars in that it revolves around music, comedy and the inter-relationships between the band members onstage. According to McDermott, the group is named GUD in mockery of the way American people pronounce the word &quot;God&quot;, &quot;because that&#x27;s who Americans thank at awards ceremonies, and I thought someone should be taking the credit.&quot; Their 2003 show, &quot;Gud Ugh&quot;, won &quot;The Age&quot; Critic&#x27;s Choice Award for best Australian show of the festival.

In 2002, he also performed a solo stand-up show entitled &quot;Comedyoscopy&quot;, a deconstruction of comedy, comedic techniques and what makes people laugh. He has frequently participated in the televised &quot;Comedy Festival Gala&quot;, appearing in 2008 as its host, and has often captained one of the two competing teams in the festival&#x27;s Great Debate since his first debate appearance in 1994.

===Other projects===
McDermott has written as a columnist for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;The Sun-Herald&quot;, &quot;The Weekend Australian&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot;. In late 2000, a selection of his columns were published in his first solo book, &quot;The Forgetting of Wisdom&quot;. Prior to this, he had coauthored books with the Doug Anthony All Stars (&quot;Book&quot;, &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot; and &quot;Trip&quot;) and the writers of &quot;Good News Week&quot; (&quot;Good News Week&quot; Books One and Two).

He has also written and illustrated three children&#x27;s books, two of which (being &quot;The Scree&quot; and &quot;The Girl Who Swallowed Bees)&quot; have been adapted into short films with McDermott scripting, directing, performing and painting all of the animations. McDermott describes the stories as &quot;little Gothic, dark, morality tales&quot; which draw on the dark children&#x27;s tales he consumed during his own childhood, such as the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s fairy tales. The 2004 film adaptation of &quot;The Scree&quot; won Best Film at the 2005 Flickerfest International Film Festival and was nominated for an AFI Award for Best Short Fiction Film, while &quot;The Girl Who Swallowed Bees&quot; (2007) won the AFI Award for Best Short Animation. McDermott says he enjoys filmmaking because it brings together all of his skills. He reportedly has plans to work on a third short film, entitled &quot;Crab Boy and the Girl in the Shell&quot;, and has expressed an interest in moving into feature films. He also voiced characters in the 2009 short film &quot;Tegan the Vegan&quot;.

McDermott has also had roles in Australian film, musical theatre and radio. In 2002, he appeared in the Australian theatre production of &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; in the role of Darryl Van Horne. Despite having sworn he would never do a musical, McDermott says he was interested in the show because &quot;it was still forming, still shaping. It&#x27;s more challenging than doing a musical that&#x27;s already in place.&quot; He has also had small acting roles in several Australian films, including that of the band manager in &quot;The Night We Called It a Day&quot; and Trevor in the TV miniseries &quot;Through My Eyes: The Lindy Chamberlain Story&quot;. In 2020, it was reported that he would play the leading role in an upcoming miniseries, &quot;The Home Team&quot;, opposite actress, Tara Morice. Between 1996 and 1997 he co-hosted the breakfast radio program on Triple J with Mikey Robins, Steve Abbott and later Jen Oldershaw.

Since the end of &quot;Good News Week&quot;, McDermott has toured in a series of concerts called &quot;Paul Sings&quot;, in which he performed a number of serious songs, most of which were previously aired on &quot;Good News Week&quot; or &quot;The Sideshow&quot;.

He was appointed Fringe Ambassador for the Adelaide Fringe in 2013.

Throughout 2018 to 2020, McDermott turned many of his paintings into a short children&#x27;s picture book, &quot;Ghostbear&quot;. The book published in late 2020, through Omnibus Books (an imprint of Scholastic) to critical and commercial success.

<doc id="609032" wikidata="Q217033" url="?curid=609032" title="Jane Russell">
<text>Ernestine Jane Geraldine Russell (June 21, 1921 – February 28, 2011) was an American actress, model, and singer. She was one of Hollywood&#x27;s leading sex symbols in the 1940s and 1950s and starred in more than 20 films throughout her career.

Russell was known for her beauty, silhouette, and a great presence that combined charisma and seriousness. She moved from the Midwest to California, where she had her first film role in Howard Hughes&#x27; &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (1943). In 1947, Russell delved into music before returning to films. After starring in several films in the 1950s, including &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown&quot; (1957), Russell again returned to music while completing several other films in the 1960s.

Russell married three times, adopted three children, and in 1955 founded Waif, the first international adoption program. She received several accolades for her achievements in film. Her hand and footprints were immortalized in the forecourt of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre with Marilyn Monroe. A star with her name was placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==
Ernestine Jane Geraldine Russell was born on June 21, 1921, in Bemidji, Minnesota. She had four brothers: Thomas, Kenneth, Jamie, and Wallace.

Her father had been a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army, and her mother an actress with a road troupe; her mother was also the subject of a portrait by Mary Bradish Titcomb, &quot;Portrait of Geraldine J.&quot;, which received public attention when purchased by Woodrow Wilson. Russell&#x27;s parents lived in Edmonton, Alberta, until shortly before her birth and returned there nine days later, where they lived for the first year or two of her life. The family then moved to Southern California where her father worked as an office manager.

Russell&#x27;s mother arranged for her to take piano lessons. Jane was also interested in drama, and participated in stage productions at Van Nuys High School. Her early ambition was to be a designer of some kind, until the death of her father in his mid-40s, when she decided to work as a receptionist after high school graduation. She also modeled for photographers, and, at the urging of her mother, studied drama and acting with Max Reinhardt&#x27;s Theatrical Workshop, and actress and acting coach Maria Ouspenskaya.

==Career==
===&quot;The Outlaw&quot;===

In 1940, Russell was signed to a seven-year contract by film mogul Howard Hughes, and made her motion-picture debut in &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (1943), a story about Billy the Kid that went to great lengths to showcase her voluptuous figure.

The movie was completed in 1941, but it was not released until 1943 in a limited release. Problems occurred with the censorship of the production code over the way her ample cleavage was displayed in promotion of the film.

When the movie was finally approved, it had a general release in 1946. During that time, Russell was kept busy doing publicity and became known nationally. Contrary to countless incorrect reports in the media since the release of &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, Russell did not wear the specially designed underwire bra that Howard Hughes had designed and made for her to wear during filming. According to Jane&#x27;s 1985 autobiography, she said that the bra was so uncomfortable that she secretly discarded it and wore her own bra with the cups padded with tissue and the straps pulled up to elevate her breasts.

Russell&#x27;s measurements were 38-24-36, and she stood 5 ft 7 in (97-61-91 cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most of her contemporaries. Her favorite co-star Bob Hope once introduced her as &quot;the two and only Jane Russell&quot;. He joked, &quot;Culture is the ability to describe Jane Russell without moving your hands.&quot; Howard Hughes said, &quot;There are two good reasons why men go to see her. Those are enough.&quot;

She was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during World War II. Speaking about her sex appeal, Russell later said, &quot;Sex appeal is good – but not in bad taste. Then it&#x27;s ugly. I don&#x27;t think a star has any business posing in a vulgar way. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of pin-up pictures that have sex appeal, interest, and allure, but they&#x27;re not vulgar. They have a little art to them. Marilyn&#x27;s calendar was artistic.&quot;

She did not appear in another movie until 1946, when she played Joan Kenwood in &quot;Young Widow&quot; for Hunt Stromberg, who released it through United Artists. The film went over budget by $600,000 and was a box office failure.

===Early musical ventures===
In 1947, Russell launched a musical career. She sang with the Kay Kyser Orchestra on radio, and recorded two singles with his band, &quot;As Long As I Live&quot; and &quot;Boin-n-n-ng!&quot; She also cut a 78 rpm album that year for Columbia Records, &quot;Let&#x27;s Put Out the Lights&quot;, which included eight torch ballads and cover art that included a diaphanous gown.

In a 2009 interview for the liner notes to another CD, &quot;Fine and Dandy&quot;, Russell denounced the Columbia album as &quot;horrible and boring to listen to&quot;. It was reissued on CD in 2002, in a package that also included the Kyser singles and two songs she recorded for Columbia in 1949 that had gone unreleased at the time. In 1950, she recorded a single, &quot;Kisses and Tears&quot;, with Frank Sinatra and The Modernaires for Columbia.

===&quot;The Paleface&quot;===
Russell&#x27;s career revived when she was cast as Calamity Jane opposite Bob Hope in &quot;The Paleface&quot; (1948) on loan out to Paramount. The film was a sizeable box office hit, earning $4.5 million and becoming Paramount&#x27;s most successful release of the year.

Russell shot &quot;Montana Belle&quot; for Fidelity Pictures in 1948, playing Belle Starr. The film was intended to be released by Republic Pictures, but the producer sold the film to RKO, who released it in 1952.

=== RKO Pictures ===
Howard Hughes bought RKO Pictures, and would be Russell&#x27;s main employer for the next few years.

At that studio, Russell co-starred with Groucho Marx and Frank Sinatra in a musical comedy, &quot;Double Dynamite&quot;, shot in 1948 and released in 1951. It was a critical and commercial failure.

Hughes cast Russell opposite Robert Mitchum and Vincent Price in &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; (1951), a film noir originally directed by John Farrow in 1950 which would be reshot by Richard Fleischer the following year. Russell sang two songs in the movie.

Russell did two more film noirs: &quot;The Las Vegas Story&quot; (1952) with Price and Victor Mature, and &quot;Macao&quot; (1952) with Mitchum. &quot;His Kind of Woman&quot; and &quot;Macao&quot; were minor hits but both involved so much re-shooting because of the interference of Hughes that they lost money.

Paramount borrowed Russell for a reunion with Hope, &quot;Son of Paleface&quot; (1952), which was another hit. She had a cameo in &quot;Road to Bali&quot; (1953).

===&quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;===

Russell played Dorothy Shaw in the hit film &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1953) opposite Marilyn Monroe for 20th Century Fox. The film was a huge success, Russell&#x27;s biggest hit since &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, making over $5 million.

Back at RKO, she was in Howard Hughes&#x27;s production &quot;The French Line&quot; (1954), a musical. The movie&#x27;s penultimate moment showed Russell in a form-fitting one-piece bathing suit with strategic cutouts, performing a then-provocative musical number titled &quot;Lookin&#x27; for Trouble&quot;. In her autobiography, Russell said that the revealing outfit was an alternative to Hughes&#x27; original suggestion of a bikini, a very racy choice for a movie costume in 1954. Russell said that she initially wore the bikini in front of her &quot;horrified&quot; movie crew while &quot;feeling very naked&quot;. The movie earned $3 million.
Hughes also produced &quot;Underwater!&quot; (1955), an adventure film with Russell and Richard Egan at RKO. It made $2 million but because of its large cost was a financial flop. Her contract with Hughes ended in February 1954.

===Russ-Field Productions===
In 1953, Russell and her first husband, former Los Angeles Rams quarterback Bob Waterfield, formed Russ-Field Productions. In March 1954, they signed a six-picture deal with United Artists to last over three years; Russell only had to appear in three of the films.

Russ-Field loaned out Russell&#x27;s services for appearing as Amanda Lawrence in &quot;Foxfire&quot; (1955) at Universal, opposite Jeff Chandler. Russell was paid $200,000 for her role and had the right to draw on Chandler&#x27;s services for a film later on for her own production company. The film was a moderate success, earning $2 million. That same year, Russell co-starred with Clark Gable in &quot;The Tall Men&quot; at 20th Century Fox, one of the most popular films of the year, with earnings of $6 million.

Russ-Field produced &quot;Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot; (1955), a sequel to &quot;Blondes&quot; in which Russell starred alongside Jeanne Crain, for release through United Artists. It was not as successful as the original.

Russ-Field also made some films without Russell for United Artists, such as the 1956 film&quot;The King and Four Queens,&quot; starring Gable and Eleanor Parker (co-produced with Gable&#x27;s company, GABCO Productions). That same year, they released &quot;Run for the Sun,&quot; an adaptation of Richard Connell&#x27;s short story &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;, starring Richard Widmark and Jane Greer. In 1957, Russell starred in Russ-Field&#x27;s last production, the romantic comedy &quot;The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown&quot;, which was a box-office failure.

===Return to music===
On the musical front, Russell formed a gospel quartet in 1954, with three other members of a faith-sharing group called the Hollywood Christian Group. The other original members were Connie Haines, Beryl Davis and Della Russell. Haines was a former vocalist in the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras, while Davis was a British emigrant who had moved to the United States after success entertaining American troops stationed in England during World War II. Della Russell was the wife of crooner Andy Russell. Backed by an orchestra conducted by Lyn Murray, their choral single &quot;Do Lord&quot; reached number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart in May 1954, selling two million copies. Della Russell, no relation to Jane, soon left the group, but Jane, Haines and Davis followed up with a trio LP for Capitol Records, &quot;The Magic of Believing.&quot; Later, another Hollywood bombshell, Rhonda Fleming, joined them for more gospel recordings. The Capitol LP was issued on CD in 2008, in a package that also included the choral singles by the original quartet and two tracks with Fleming replacing Della Russell. A collection of some of Russell&#x27;s gospel and secular recordings was issued on CD in Britain in 2005, and it includes more secular recordings, including Russell&#x27;s spoken-word performances of &quot;Hollywood Riding Hood&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Cinderella&quot; backed by a jazz group that featured Terry Gibbs and Tony Scott.

In October 1957, she debuted in a successful solo nightclub act at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. She also fulfilled later engagements in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America and Europe. A self-titled solo LP was issued on MGM Records in 1959. It was reissued on CD in 2009 under the title &quot;Fine and Dandy,&quot; and the CD included some demo and soundtrack recordings, as well. &quot;I finally got to make a record the way I wanted to make it,&quot; she said of the MGM album in the liner notes to the CD reissue. In 1959, she debuted with a tour of &quot;Janus&quot; in New England, performed in &quot;Skylark&quot; and also starred in &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; at the Westchester Town House in Yonkers, New York.

===Television===
Russell moved into television, appearing in episodes of &quot;Colgate Theatre&quot;, &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days (the &quot;Splinter Station&quot;, 1960)&quot; and &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;. In 1999, she remarked, &quot;Why did I quit movies? Because I was getting too old! You couldn&#x27;t go on acting in those years if you were an actress over 30.&quot;

Russell was referenced in a 1956 episode of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;. Ralph Kramden (played by Jackie Gleason) arrives home &quot;dead&quot; tired, vowing to go straight to bed after dinner, quipping, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t get me out of this house tonight if you told me that Jane Russell was runnin’ a party upstairs and she couldn&#x27;t get started until I arrived!&quot; Later, Kramden becomes aware that his best friend and neighbor, Ed Norton, is in fact throwing a party upstairs and did not invite him. After being reminded by his wife, Alice, of his reluctance to attend even a party that Jane Russell was throwing, an insulted Kramden rants, &quot;I was talking about Jane Russell: I said nothing about any party that Norton&#x27;s running!&quot;

On the sitcom &quot;Maude&quot; (the episode &quot;The Wallet&quot;), Walter Findlay (played by Bill Macy) carries a lipstick impression and autograph of Jane Russell on a cocktail napkin in his wallet as a good luck charm.

Her last on-screen appearance was in a 1986 episode of &quot;Hunter&quot;.

===Later career===
Russell made her first movie appearance in a number of years in &quot;Fate Is the Hunter&quot; (1964), in which she was seen as herself performing for the USO in a flashback sequence. She was second-billed in two A.C. Lyles Westerns, &quot;Johnny Reno&quot; (1966) and &quot;Waco&quot; (1966), and starred in &quot;Cauliflower Cupids&quot;, filmed in 1966 but not released until 1970. Russell had a character role in &quot;The Born Losers&quot; (1967) and &quot;Darker Than Amber&quot; (1970). After this, she retired from acting in movies, saying she was getting too old.

In 1971, Russell starred in the musical drama &quot;Company&quot;, making her debut on Broadway in the role of Joanne, succeeding Elaine Stritch. Russell performed the role of Joanne for almost six months.

Also in the 1970s, Russell appeared in television commercials as a spokesperson for Playtex&#x27;s Cross-Your-Heart Bras&#x27; for us full-figured gals&quot;, featuring the &quot;18-Hour Bra&quot;.

Russell had a semi-recurring guest role in the soap opera &quot;The Yellow Rose&quot; (1983) on television and guest-starred on &quot;Hunter&quot; (1986). She wrote her autobiography, &quot;Jane Russell: My Path and My Detours,&quot; which was published in 1985.

In 1989, Russell received the Women&#x27;s International Center Living Legacy Award. Her handprints and footprints are immortalized at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre, and she has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6850 Hollywood Boulevard. Russell was voted one of the 40 Most Iconic Movie Goddesses of all time in 2009 by &quot;Glamour&quot; (UK edition).

==Portrayals==
In the 1996 HBO film &quot;Norma Jean &amp; Marilyn&quot;, Erika Nann portrayed Russell leaving her hand imprints at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre alongside Monroe. In 2001, Russell was portrayed by Renee Henderson in the CBS miniseries &quot;Blonde&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Joyce Carol Oates.

==Personal life==

After Russell became pregnant with her high-school sweetheart Bob Waterfield&#x27;s baby, she underwent a botched abortion in 1942 that left her unable to bear children. The abortion went so wrong that Russell had to be hospitalized and nearly died. After this experience, Russell described herself as &quot;vigorously pro-life&quot;. She also spoke out against abortion in case of rape or incest.

Russell married Waterfield in Las Vegas on April 24, 1943. He was a UCLA All-American, quarterback for the Cleveland Rams/Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Rams head coach, and member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In February 1952, Russell and Waterfield adopted a baby girl, whom they named Tracy. In December 1952, they adopted a fifteen-month-old boy, Thomas, whose birth mother, Hannah McDermott, had moved to London to escape poverty in Northern Ireland, and, in 1956, they adopted a nine-month-old boy, Robert John. In 1955, Russell founded Waif, an organization to place children with adoptive families, and which pioneered adoptions from foreign countries by Americans. In February 1968, Russell filed for divorce from Waterfield, charging him with &quot;cruelty and physical abuse&quot;. The divorce was finalized in July 1968, with Russell gaining full custody of her two eldest children and Waterfield gaining full custody of their youngest child. Both were granted visitation rights.

On August 25, 1968, one month after her divorce from Waterfield, Russell married actor Roger Barrett, whom she had met at a stock company production. Barrett died of a heart attack only three months later in November 1968.

Russell married real-estate broker John Calvin Peoples in 1974. In the late 1970s, Russell and Peoples moved to Sedona, Arizona, where they owned Dude&#x27;s nightclub, and Russell revived her nightclub act. They spent the majority of their married life residing in Santa Maria, California. Peoples died of heart failure on April 9, 1999.

In the film &quot;Philomena&quot; (2013), Russell&#x27;s photograph appears on a wall; a character states that Russell bought a child for £1,000 from the tainted Sean Ross Abbey in Ireland featured in this true-life film; but this claim is countered in at least one recent British report, which states that in the mid-1950s, Russell and her husband &quot;rather informally adopted a son from a woman living in London, but originating in Derry, Northern Ireland. There was a major scandal and a court case, after which Russell was allowed to formalise the adoption.&quot;

Russell was a devout Christian. At the height of her career, Russell started the &quot;Hollywood Christian Group&quot;, a weekly Bible study at her home which was attended by many of the leading names in the film industry. Russell tried to invite Marilyn Monroe to join, but she declined. Monroe once said, &quot;Jane tried to convert me [to Christianity], and I tried to introduce her to Freud.&quot; In an interview, Russell later said &quot;I certainly wasn&#x27;t trying to convert her to religion because I don&#x27;t like religion&quot;, noting that she didn&#x27;t consider Christianity &quot;a religion&quot;. Russell appeared occasionally on the &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; television program on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, a Christian television channel based in Tustin, California.

Russell was a prominent supporter of the Republican Party, and attended Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s inauguration, along with such other notables from Hollywood as Lou Costello, Dick Powell, June Allyson, Hugh O&#x27;Brian, Anita Louise and Louella Parsons. She was a recovering alcoholic who went into rehab at age 79, and described herself in a 2003 interview, saying, &quot;These days, I am a teetotal, mean-spirited, right-wing, narrow-minded, conservative Christian bigot, but not a racist.&quot;

== Death ==
Russell resided in the Santa Maria Valley along the Central Coast of California. She died at her home in Santa Maria of a respiratory-related illness on February 28, 2011. Her funeral was held on March 12, 2011, at Pacific Christian Church, Santa Maria. Russell was survived by her three children, eight grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.

<text>Emerald is a rural town and locality in the Central Highlands Region, Queensland, Australia. The town is the headquarters for the Central Highlands Regional Council. In the , the locality of Emerald had a population of 14,904 people.

== History ==
The traditional owners include the Gayiri people who occupied the area for tens of thousands of years before European colonisation began in the nineteenth century. The Gayiri (Kairi, Khararya) language region takes in the landscape of the Central Highlands Region, including Emerald and the Nogoa River.

The first European to explore the area was Ludwig Leichhardt between 1843 and 1845. The British Colony of Queensland was established in 1859.

The town takes its name from the pastoral run Emerald Downs, a name chosen circa 1860 by pastoralist Peter Fitzallan Macdonald. It has been claimed that the origin of that name relates to the finding of the emerald gemstone, but another claim is that it was named for the lush green pastures in the area.

Emerald was established in 1879 as a base for the Central line railway from Rockhampton. Emerald Post Office opened on 5 June 1879.

Emerald State School opened on 3 November 1879. A secondary department was added to the school in 1919 but that department was closed in 1921. The secondary department reopened in 1959 and operated until the separate Emerald State High School opened in 1969.

St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic School was established on 31 January 1902 by the Presentation Sisters. They provided a boarding facility for girls and boys from 1906 to 1961. The last of the Presentation Sisters left the school in 1992 after which it was operated by the Rockhampton Catholic Education Office.

Emerald North State School opened on 29 January 1980. A preschool was added on 20 February 1980. A special education unit opened on 23 January 1984. The preschool and special education units closed in 1999.

The Emerald campus of the Capricornia School of Distance Education opened on 1 February 1993.

The new Emerald Library building opened in 1994.

Marist College was established in 1996 by the Marist Brothers.

Denison State School opened on 28 January 1997. It takes its name from the County of Denison, which was named after Sir William Denison, the Governor General of the Australian Colonies in the 1850s.

In October 1999, as part of the Van Gogh Project, the Big Easel was unveiled in Emerald.

Emerald Christian College (originally known as Emerald Educational College) opened in 2001.

The citrus industry was severely affected by a citrus canker outbreak that started in 2004 and was declared over in early 2009. More than half a million citrus trees located around Emerald had to be destroyed.

The visitor information centre opened on 26 September 2005.

In 2007, the Emerald Uniting Church was enlarged by the Uniting congregation at Fernlees when that church was closed.

St Brigid&#x27;s Catholic Primary School was established in 2014 by the Rockhampton Catholic Education Office.

Ontrack College Emerald opened in February 2018 (originally called Ontrack Special Assistance College). It was established by the Emerald Christian College to support students who are disengaged from mainstream schooling.

On 17 April 2020, the Queensland Government re-drew the boundaries of localities within the Central Highlands Region by replacing the locality of The Gemfields with three new localities of Rubyvale, Sapphire Central and Anakie Siding (around the towns of Rubyvale, Sapphire, and Anakie respectively). This included adjusting the boundaries of other existing localities in the Region to accommodate these changes; Emerald gained the north-eastern corner and eastern parts of The Gemfields but losing a small area on its western boundary to the new Anakie Siding, increasing the area of the locality from .

== Geography ==
Emerald lies on the Nogoa River, a tributary of the Fitzroy River. The town lies approximately from the Coral Sea coast and approximately west of the city of Rockhampton by road at the junction of the Capricorn and Gregory highways. Emerald sits approximately south of the Tropic of Capricorn.

===Climate===
Emerald has a hot semi-arid climate (Koppen: &quot;BSh&quot;) with very hot, relatively wet summers and very mild, dry winters with cool nights. Warm to hot weather dominate for most of the year, with mean maximums ranging from in January to in July. The average annual rainfall is , with a summer maximum. Temperature extremes have ranged from on 15 December 1919 to on 4 July 1899.

The original weather station was at the post office, starting in 1883. It closed in 1992, in favour of a new weather station at the airport south east.
=== Flooding ===
Some of the recorded floods to have occurred in the region include 1863, 1864, 1868, 1870, 1871, 1872, 1875, 1876, 1878, 1882, 1887, 1890, 1894, 1896, 1898, 1906, 1912, 1918, and 1950 (when rain was recorded in Queensland). 1956 was the wettest year on record with rainfall, and the 1970s also had similar rainfall to the 1860s and 1870s.

Prior to the 1990s, flood damage to residential properties was almost non-existent. The biggest impact of flooding of the Nogoa River in Emerald itself was that one side of Emerald was cut off from the other and caravans at the Carinya Caravan Park would be towed to higher ground each time the Nogoa River rose, to prevent the caravans from being completely submerged. This caravan park is now the site of the Centro Property where Coles Supermarket and other businesses operate. A former swamp area is now part of Kidd Street (a housing development) which was an old river course. The watercourse that extended along the back of the hospital, past the rear of Woolworths and past the Information Centre has been converted into a channel with a concrete section on one side near the information centre, reducing the channel in size by approximately two-thirds. This area has been allowed to be developed in the vicinity of Creek Street.

Fairbairn Dam overflowed for the first time in 17 years on 19 January 2008. Major flooding in Emerald occurred a few days later as the Nogoa River broke its banks. The floods resulted in 1,000 houses being affected and more than 2,500 people being evacuated. The 2008 floods did not reach the heights of flooding in previous years.

To the west of the town is an area known as The Gemfields, with small towns such as Sapphire and Rubyvale indicating the type of gems found there. The sapphire fields located here are the largest in the southern hemisphere.

The Fairbairn Dam, a short drive to the south of the town, was opened in 1972, and holds back the waters of Lake Maraboon. The lake covers an area of up to , making it one of the largest artificial lakes in the country. When full, it holds three times more water than Sydney Harbour. This extensive water supply has allowed the cotton industry to flourish in the area, and the lake is a boon for local water sports.

Erected in 1999, the world&#x27;s largest Vincent van Gogh sunflower painting is situated in Moreton Park. The structure is high. It is one of seven works around the world by Cameron Cross in which he reproduces Van Gogh&#x27;s sunflowers for the Van Gogh Project. He chose Emerald as a site for his work as it is a sunflower-growing area and has an annual sunflower festival. Being an oversized reproduction, it is considered one of Australia&#x27;s Big Things.

== Events ==
Emerald holds an annual sunflower festival in the week before Easter.

== Media ==
=== Newspapers ===
&quot;Emerald Today&quot;, published each Friday, is the local Emerald newspaper. The newspaper focuses on local news and sport.

=== Radio ===
Emerald is served by two local commercial stations, one local ABC station and one local community station.

4HI is the oldest local radio station in Emerald, beginning transmissions from their local studio in November 1981. The station offers local breakfast and drive programming from their Emerald studio and carries nationally syndicated programming from 2GB Sydney.

In the late 1990s, youth-orientated commercial station Hot FM was launched in Emerald. Even though the station plays local commercials and imaging on a local frequency, no programming on the station originates from Emerald. Until 2013, the breakfast program which aired on Hot FM in Emerald was a regionally networked program from Townsville. It was subsequently replaced with the Hot FM CQ breakfast program that originates from Gladstone.

Emerald is served by ABC Capricornia, the region&#x27;s ABC Local Radio station. ABC Capricornia is broadcast on a local frequency, but no programming originates from Emerald as the station&#x27;s local breakfast and morning programs are relayed to the Emerald transmitter from Rockhampton.

Emerald is also served by local community radio station, 4EEE.

=== Television ===
Emerald receives all available ABC and commercial television stations from Rockhampton, and therefore local news bulletins &quot;Seven News&quot; and &quot;WIN News&quot; are broadcast to Emerald, with the bulletins occasionally featuring local news from the Central Highlands region.

== Sport ==
The most popular sport in Emerald is rugby league. The town has two teams, the Emerald Tigers and the Emerald Brothers, both of whom compete in the Central Highlands Rugby League competition, administered by the Queensland Rugby League.

<text>Edo Murtić (4 May 1921 – 2 January 2005) was a painter from Croatia, best known for his lyrical abstraction and abstract expressionism style. He worked in a variety of media, including oil painting, gouache, graphic design, ceramics, mosaics, murals and theatrical set design. Murtić travelled and exhibited extensively in Europe and North America, gaining international recognition for his work, which can be found in museums, galleries and private collections worldwide. He was one of the founders of the group &quot;March&quot; (&quot;Mart&quot;) in 1956, and received many international awards. In 1958 Murtić participated in the three biggest events in the world of contemporary art: the Venice Biennale, the Carnegie Prize in Pittsburgh, and Documenta in Kassel. Interest in the art of Edo Murtić continues to grow, with retrospective exhibits in major museums.

Murtić was a member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and a member of the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights.

==Biography==
Murtić was born on 4 May 1921 in Velika Pisanica near Bjelovar, Croatia (then in Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes). He was the second child of Vinko and Franciska Murtić. Early in his childhood, the family moved to Zagreb where Murtić received his education. He attended Craft School 1935–39, studying under Edo Kovačević, Kamilo Tompa and Ernest Tomašević. His first exhibition was held in 1935 at the Royal High School in Zagreb.

In 1939, Murtić enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb under Ljubo Babić and Krsto Hegedušić. During 1940 he attended classes given by Petar Dobrović in Belgrade returning to Zagreb in 1941 to complete his studies at the academy.

Murtić was strongly influenced by socialist ideas, and at the outbreak of the Second World War he became involved in the anti-fascist movement. In the spring of 1944, Murtić joined the liberation forces, where he worked designing graphics, posters, and books. In the years following the war, Murtić began to travel and exhibit extensively. In 1951 he spent time in the U.S. and Canada, where he encountered the abstract expressionism movement. Back in Zagreb he was one of the founders of the group &quot;March&quot; (&quot;Mart&quot;) in 1956.

In 1958 Murtić participated in the three biggest events in the world of contemporary art: the Venice Biennale, the Carnegie Prize in Pittsburgh, and Documenta in Kassel.

Murtić&#x27;s wife was Goranka Vrus Murtić, a well-known artist in her own right. Together they bought and renovated an old stone house in the town of Vrsar, on the Istrian coast. Although their main residence was in Zagreb, they spent much of each year in Vrsar. Of his summer house and studio, Murtić said &quot;It is really nice here, I enjoy the silence and concentration that is irreplaceable... I do not know if I would find a more beautiful place anywhere in the world.&quot; The landscape there inspired many of his paintings, especially the &quot;Montraker&quot; cycle, which is named for the nearby Ancient Roman stone quarry.

Edo Murtić was a member of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (now the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts) and the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. He was named an honorary citizen of the town of Bjelovar.

Edo Murtić died in Zagreb on 2 January 2005, aged 83.

==Legacy==

Edo Murtić was a prominent representative of abstract painting. Primarily known for painting in oil, and gouache, he also produced a variety of other works such as graphic design, ceramics, mosaics, murals, and theatrical set design.

Murtic&#x27;s early work was mainly realistic paintings of interiors, portraits and still lifes, and graphical illustrations.

Following the Second World War, a new direction in art was taking place in North America, particularly New York where Abstract Expressionism became a personal expression of the artists&#x27; feelings and experiences. At the same time in Paris, Lyrical Abstraction was establishing a new identity. During the 1950s, Murtić experienced both art scenes at first hand. In America he encountered artists such as Willem de Kooning and Jackson Pollock, and in Europe he saw the work of Jean René Bazaine, Alfred Manessier, and Gustave Singier. Murtić&#x27;s own paintings of this time show the influence of these ideas as he developed his own personal style.

Towards the early 1960s, there were signs of Tachisme and Art Informel in his work. His paintings on dark ground were almost monochrome, while those on a light ground showed a rhythmical movement of a dark mass across it. This distinctive theme became his trademark style, with increasingly dynamic strokes with intense, energetic colour.
During the 1970s, Murtić&#x27;s works began appearing in public areas, such as in the Mirogoj Cemetery in Zagreb, the Memorial in the Čazma Ossuary, the Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall, and the Zagrepčanka office building (1975).

By the 1980s, Murtić was internationally recognized as one of the leading abstract painters from the socialist world. In the summer of 1981 he spent months sailing around the southern Adriatic coast. From that experience came his &quot;Fires&quot; (Požari) cycle, a masterful interpretation of the landscape using strong gesture and expressive colour.

The &quot;Eyes of Fear&quot; cycle (1981-4) was stimulated by a new edition of &quot;Jama&quot;, a poem by Ivan Goran Kovačić on the horrors of war. Once again committing himself to create the illustrations, Murtić immersed himself in the topic of war, violence, pain and fear. He uses the symbolism of two dark figures from mythology - the Minotaur and the Raven, who are depicted at various times as horse, bull and villain. A threatening atmosphere is created by these figures combined with a stark red and black colour scheme and the tension of his drawing.

The &quot;Montraker&quot; cycle (1992–95) was inspired by the Ancient Roman stone quarry near Vrsar, which became an important motif for Murtić. He was inspired not just by the landscape itself, but its history of being shaped by the hand of man. He portrayed the rocks and the surrounding views with the lights and shadows of different times of day, through the seasons and changing weather, giving a sense of the passage of time both in the landscape, and in himself.

Even in his most abstract work, Murtić remained connected with nature. The shapes of the landscape are expressed by gesture or selection of colour. The line of the hill, rock, or tree are portrayed without reference to volume, and his palette was based on the colours and lights of the surrounding landscape. Edo Murtić himself said of his paintings that he &quot;drew these colours out of the Istrian landscape&quot; and that it would be possible to talk of &quot;some essence of colour&quot;.

In January 2010, an exhibit of Edo Murtić&#x27;s &quot;War&quot; (&quot;Rat&quot;) opened at the Art Pavilion in Zagreb. Over 350 of his drawings, gouaches and collages on the subject of death, suffering, horror, and war were on display, presenting a strong humanist and anti-war message. At the opening reception, guests included the President of the Republic of Croatia Ivo Josipović, Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, Deputy Prime Minister Đurđa Adlešič, Minister of Culture Božo Biškupić, fellow artists, architects, musicians, directors and many others. In his opening remarks, Božo Biškupić called Murtić &quot;one of the greatest Croatian artists of the second half of the 20th century&quot; and one who &quot;pointed the way to the beginning of a new century&quot;. The Director of the Art Pavilion, Radovan Vuković described the exhibit as an &quot;exceptional cultural and artistic event&quot;, and referring to the large crowd at the opening said &quot;This confirms that Edo Murtić is not just a name, a symbol of Croatian culture and art of the 20th century, but that five years after his death still excites incredible interest&quot;.

The Murtić Foundation (&quot;Fundacija Murtić&quot;) has been established to ensure that his art will continue to be available for future generations. &quot;The Foundation will contribute to building our national identity&quot; said Ivo Josipović, the Croatian President, &quot;It deserves a museum because his work is great and very important, and the next generation will certainly want to see it.

Edo Murtić donated over 1,500 of his works to the City of Zagreb, including paintings, sculptures, mosaics, drawings, ceramics and enamels. An exhibit of 300 selected works &quot;From the Murtić Donation&quot; opened in the Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb in October 2010. As part of the opening celebrations, the street on the east side of the museum was officially named in his honour.

<text>Janna J. Levin (born 1967) is an American theoretical cosmologist and a professor of physics and astronomy at Barnard College. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in astronomy and physics with a concentration in philosophy at Barnard College in 1988 and a PhD in theoretical physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1993. Much of her work deals with looking for evidence to support the proposal that our universe might be finite in size due to its having a nontrivial topology. Other work includes black holes and chaos theory. She joined the faculty at Barnard College in January 2004 and is currently the Claire Tow Professor of Physics and Astronomy.

==Biography==
Levin was born to Yiddish-speaking Jewish parents in Texas. Her grandparents were immigrants from Eastern Europe, who eventually gave up keeping kosher. She describes her household as mostly not religious (Levin was not brought to synagogue and was not bat mitzvahed). Levin attended Columbia University for her bachelor&#x27;s degree and MIT for her Ph.D, graduating in 1993. In 2002 she held a research fellowship at Cambridge University (England).

Janna Levin is a professor of physics and astronomy at Barnard College of Columbia University with a grant from the Tow Foundation. She researches black holes, the cosmology of extra dimensions, and gravitational waves in the shape of spacetime. In addition she is the director of sciences at Pioneer Works.

Levin is the author of the popular science book &quot;How the Universe Got Its Spots: Diary of a Finite Time in a Finite Space&quot;. In 2006, she published &quot;A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines&quot;, a novel of ideas recounting the lives and deaths of Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing.

Levin has written a series of essays to accompany exhibitions at several galleries in England, including the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art and the Hayward Gallery. Levin was featured on &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; on July 12, 2002. She appeared as a guest on Stephen Colbert&#x27;s Comedy Central show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on August 24, 2006. She also appeared as the featured guest on the &quot;Speaking of Faith&quot; radio show on February 22, 2009, where she discussed her book &quot;A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines&quot; with the show&#x27;s host Krista Tippett.
Levin presented &quot;The sound the universe makes&quot; on TED.com on March 1, 2011. She was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 2012.

Her book &quot;Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space&quot; was published in March, 2016. The book is about the history of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and the 2015 discovery of gravitational waves. In a review of the book published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, British astrophysicist John Gribbin wrote, &quot;This is a splendid book that I recommend to anyone with an interest in how science works and in the power of human imagination and ability.&quot; In January 2018 she hosted Nova&#x27;s award-winning episode &quot;Black Hole Apocalypse.&quot;

==Personal life==

Levin did not officially graduate from high school, as she was in a serious car accident and hospitalized for a time.

Levin is the parent of two children, a son born in 2004 and a daughter born in 2007. Her partner, Warren, is a musician.

<text>Ostyak () is a name formerly used to refer to several Indigenous peoples and languages in Siberia, Russia. Both the Khanty people and the Ket people were formerly called Ostyaks, whereas the Selkup people were referred to as Ostyak-Samoyed.

==Khanty==

The Khanty people, who also call themselves &quot;Khanti&quot;, &quot;Khande&quot;, or &quot;Kantek&quot; were known to the Russians as &quot;Yugra&quot; in the eleventh century, with the name &quot;Ostyak&quot; first appearing in the sixteenth century. The Soviet Union began using the endonym &quot;Khant&quot; or &quot;Khanty&quot; during the 1930s.

 some 28,000 people identify as Khanty, primarily in Tyumen Oblast, which includes the Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug.

The Khanty languages, also known as Hanty, Khant, Xanty, or Ostyak, are a Uralic language group with about 9,500 native speakers.

==Ket==
The Kets historically lived near the Yenisei River in the Krasnoyarsk Krai district of Russia. The Imperial Russians originally called them &quot;Ostyak&quot;, and later &quot;Yenisei Ostyak&quot;. Fewer than 1,500 people identified themselves as Ket during the 2002 Russian census.

The Ket language, also known as Imbatski-Ket or Yenisei Ostyak, is a Yeniseian language. It is considered severely endangered to moribund.

==Selkup==
The Selkup people were known as Ostyak-Samoyeds until the 1930s. They are descended from both Yeniseian and Samoyedic peoples, and live in the northern parts of the Siberian plain. About 4,000 people identified as Selkup during the 2002 Russian census.

The Selkup language, also known as Selkups, Chumyl&#x27; Khumyt, Shöl Khumyt, Shösh Gulla, Syusugulla, or Ostyak Samoyed, is a Uralic Samoyedic language with perhaps two thousand or more native speakers. The northern dialect is taught in some schools.

<text>Foxing is an age-related process of deterioration that causes spots and browning on old paper documents such as books, postage stamps, old paper money and s.

Alternatively, it may derive from the fox-like reddish-brown color of the stains. Paper so affected is said to be &quot;foxed&quot;.

Foxing is seldom found in incunabula, or books printed before 1501. Decrease in rag fibre quality may be a culprit; as demand for paper rose in later centuries, papermakers used less water and spent less time cleansing the rag fibres used to make paper. An early work of art to have been affected by foxing is the &quot;Portrait of a Man in Red Chalk&quot;, a drawing on paper by Leonardo da Vinci.

Foxing also occurs in biological study skins or specimens, as an effect of chemical reactions or mold on melanin. Textiles, such as articles of clothing, so affected may also be said to be foxed.

Aside from foxing, other types of age-related paper deterioration include destruction of the lignin by sunlight and absorbed atmospheric pollution, typically causing the paper to become brown and crumble at the edges, and acid-related damage to cheap paper such as newsprint, which manufacturers make without neutralizing acidic contaminants.

== Causes of foxing ==
The causes of foxing are not well understood. One conjecture is that foxing is caused by a fungal growth on the paper. Another is that foxing is caused by the effect on certain papers of the oxidation of iron, copper, or other substances in the pulp or rag from which the paper was made. It is possible that multiple factors are involved. High humidity may contribute to foxing.

== Repairing foxed documents ==

Foxed documents can be repaired, with greater or lesser success, using sodium borohydride, proprietary bleaches, dilute hydrogen peroxide or lasers. Each method risks side effects or damage to the paper or ink. 

Another method is to scan the image and process that image using a high-level image processing program. This can usually remove the effects of foxing while leaving text and images intact.

== In biological specimens ==
It is generally not advisable to repair study specimens, except perhaps for mechanical damage. Type specimens should – if at all possible – not be altered in any way. If foxing affects the study value of a specimen (e.g. in bird or mammal skins or in insects, where it may affect diagnostic coloration), this might rather be remarked on the specimen label. Color standards can provide a means of documenting coloration before or in the early stages of foxing.

<doc id="609065" wikidata="Q817650" url="?curid=609065" title="COM file">
<text>A COM file is a type of simple executable file. On the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX operating systems of the 1970s, codice_1 was used as a filename extension for text files containing commands to be issued to the operating system (similar to a batch file). With the introduction of Digital Research&#x27;s CP/M (a microcomputer operating system), the type of files commonly associated with COM extension changed to that of executable files. This convention was later carried over to DOS. Even when complemented by the more general EXE file format for executables, the compact COM files remained viable and frequently used under DOS.

The codice_1 file name extension has no relation to the .com (for &quot;commercial&quot;) top-level Internet domain name. However, this similarity in name has been exploited by malware writers.

==DOS binary format==
The COM format is the original binary executable format used in CP/M (including SCP and MSX-DOS) as well as DOS. It is very simple; it has no header (with the exception of CP/M 3 files), and contains no standard metadata, only code and data. This simplicity exacts a price: the binary has a maximum size of 65,280 (FF00h) bytes (256 bytes short of 64 KiB) and stores all its code and data in one segment.

Since it lacks relocation information, it is loaded by the operating system at a pre-set address, at offset 0100h immediately following the PSP, where it is executed (hence the limitation of the executable&#x27;s size): the entry point is fixed at 0100h. This was not an issue on 8-bit machines since they can only address 64k of memory, but 16-bit machines have a much larger address space, which is why the format fell out of use.

In the Intel 8080 CPU architecture, only 65,536 bytes of memory could be addressed (address range 0000h to FFFFh). Under CP/M, the first 256 bytes of this memory, from 0000h to 00FFh were reserved for system use by the zero page, and any user program had to be loaded at exactly 0100h to be executed. COM files fit this model perfectly. Before the introduction of MP/M and Concurrent CP/M, there was no possibility of running more than one program or command at a time: the program loaded at 0100h was run, and no other.

Although the file format is the same in DOS and CP/M, .COM files for the two operating systems are not compatible; DOS COM files contain x86 instructions and possibly DOS system calls, while CP/M COM files contain 8080 instructions and CP/M system calls (programs restricted to certain machines could also contain additional instructions for 8085 or Z80).

.COM files in DOS set all x86 segment registers to the same value and the SP (stack pointer) register to the offset of the last word available in the first 64 KiB segment (typically FFFEh) or the maximum size of memory available in the block the program is loaded into for both, the program plus at least 256 bytes stack, whatever is smaller, thus the stack begins at the very top of the corresponding memory segment and works down from there.

In the original DOS 1.x API, which was a derivative of the CP/M API, program termination of a .COM file would be performed by calling the INT 20h (Terminate Program) function or else INT 21h Function 0, which served the same purpose, and the programmer also had to ensure that the code and data segment registers contained the same value at program termination to avoid a potential system crash. Although this could be used in any DOS version, Microsoft recommended the use of INT 21h Function 4Ch for program termination from DOS 2.x onward, which did not require the data and code segment to be set to the same value.

It is possible to make a .COM file to run under both operating systems in form of a fat binary. There is no true compatibility at the instruction level; the instructions at the entry point are chosen to be equal in functionality but different in both operating systems, and make program execution jump to the section for the operating system in use. It is basically two different programs with the same functionality in a single file, preceded by code selecting the one to use.

Under CP/M 3, if the first byte of a COM file is C9h, there is a 256-byte header; since C9h corresponds to the 8080 instruction codice_3, this means that the COM file will immediately terminate if run on an earlier version of CP/M that does not support this extension. (Because the instruction sets of the 8085 and Z80 are supersets of the 8080 instruction set, this works on all three processors.) C9h is an invalid opcode on the 8088/8086, and it will cause a processor-generated interrupt 6 exception in v86 mode on the 386 and later x86 chips. Since C9h is the opcode for LEAVE since the 80188/80186 and therefore not used as the first instruction in a valid program, the executable loader in some versions of DOS rejects COM files that start with C9h, avoiding a crash.

Files may have names ending in .COM, but not be in the simple format described above; this is indicated by a magic number at the start of the file. For example, the COMMAND.COM file in DR DOS 6.0 is actually in DOS executable format, indicated by the first two bytes being &quot;MZ&quot; (4Dh 5Ah), the initials of Mark Zbikowski.

==Large programs==
Under DOS there is no memory management provided for COM files by the loader or execution environment. All memory is simply available to the COM file. After execution, the operating system command shell, COMMAND.COM, is reloaded. This leaves the possibilities that the COM file can either be very simple, using a single segment, or arbitrarily complex, providing its own memory management system. An example of a complex program is COMMAND.COM, the DOS shell, which provided a loader to load other COM or EXE programs. In the .COM system, larger programs (up to the available memory size) can be loaded and run, but the system loader assumes that all code and data is in the first segment, and it is up to the .COM program to provide any further organization. Programs larger than available memory, or large data segments, can be handled by dynamic linking, if the necessary code is included in the .COM program. The advantage of using the .COM rather than .EXE format is that the binary image is usually smaller and easier to program using an assembler. Once compilers and linkers of sufficient power became available, it was no longer advantageous to use the .COM format for complex programs.

==Platform support==
The format is still executable on many modern Windows NT-based platforms, but it is run in an MS-DOS-emulating subsystem, NTVDM, which is not present in 64-bit variants. COM files can be executed also on DOS emulators such as DOSBox, on any platform supported by these emulators.

==Use for compatibility reasons==
Windows NT-based operating systems use the .com extension for a small number of commands carried over from MS-DOS days although they are in fact presently implemented as .exe files. The operating system will recognize the .exe file header and execute them correctly despite their technically incorrect .com extension. (In fact any .exe file can be renamed .com and still execute correctly.) The use of the original .com extensions for these commands ensures compatibility with older DOS batch files that may refer to them with their full original filenames. These commands are codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9 and codice_10.

==Execution preference==
In DOS, if a directory contains both a COM file and an EXE file with same name, when no extension is specified the COM file is preferentially selected for execution. For example, if a directory in the system path contains two files named codice_11 and codice_12, the following would execute codice_11:

 C:\&gt;foo

A user wishing to run codice_12 can explicitly use the complete filename:

 C:\&gt;foo.exe

Taking advantage of this default behaviour, virus writers and other malicious programmers have used names like codice_15 for their creations, hoping that if it is placed in the same directory as the corresponding EXE file, a command or batch file may accidentally trigger their program instead of the text editor codice_16. Again, these .com files may in fact contain a .exe format executable.

On Windows NT and derivatives (Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7), the variable is used to override the order of preference (and acceptable extensions) for calling files without specifying the extension from the command line. The default value still places codice_17 files before codice_18 files. This closely resembles a feature previously found in JP Software&#x27;s line of extended command line processors 4DOS, 4OS2, and 4NT.

==Malicious usage of the .com extension==
Some computer virus writers have hoped to take advantage of modern computer users&#x27; likely lack of knowledge of the file extension and associated binary format, along with their more likely familiarity with the .com Internet domain name. E-mails have been sent with attachment names similar to &quot;www.example.com&quot;. Unwary Microsoft Windows users clicking on such an attachment would expect to begin browsing a site named codice_19, but instead would run the attached binary command file named codice_20, giving it full permission to do to their machine whatever its author had in mind.

There is nothing malicious about the COM file format itself; this is an exploitation of the coincidental name collision between .com &quot;com&quot;mand files and .com &quot;com&quot;mercial web sites.

<text>The bibliographical definition of an edition is all copies of a book printed from substantially the same setting of type, including all minor typographical variants.

== First edition ==

According to the definition of &quot;edition&quot; above, a book printed today, by the same publisher, and from the same type as when it was first published, is still the &quot;first edition&quot; of that book to a bibliographer. However, book collectors generally use the term &quot;first edition&quot; to mean specifically the first print run of the first edition (aka &quot;first edition, first impression&quot;). Since World War II, books often include a number line (printer&#x27;s key) that indicates the print run.

A &quot;first edition&quot; per se is not a valuable collectible book. A popular work may be published and reprinted over time by many publishers, and in a variety of formats. There will be a first edition of each, which the publisher may cite on the copyright page, such as: &quot;First mass market paperback edition&quot;. The first edition of a facsimile reprint is the reprint publisher&#x27;s first edition, but not the first edition of the work itself.

The Independent Online Booksellers Association has &quot;A First Edition Primer&quot; that discusses several aspects of identifying first editions including publishing and specific publishers way of designating first editions.

===Bibliographical definition===
The classic explanation of edition was given by Fredson Bowers in &quot;Principles of Bibliographical Description&quot; (1949). Bowers wrote that an edition is &quot;the whole number of copies printed at any time or times from substantially the same setting of type-pages,&quot; including &quot;all issues and variant states existing within its basic type-setting, as well as all impressions.&quot;

Publishers often use the same typesetting for the hardcover and trade paperback versions of a book. These books have different covers, the title page and copyright page may differ, and the page margin sizes may differ (same &quot;type area&quot;, smaller &quot;trim&quot;), but to a bibliographer they are the same edition.

From time to time, readers may observe an error in the text (or, in the days of metal type, a piece of broken type), and report these to the publisher. The publisher typically keeps these &quot;reprint corrections&quot; in a file pending demand for a new print run of the edition, and before the new run is printed, they will be entered.

The method of entry depends on the method of typesetting. For letterpress metal, it typically meant resetting a few characters or a line or two. For linotype, it meant casting a new line for any line with a change in it. With film, it involved cutting out a bit of the film and inserting a new bit. In an electronic file, it means entering the changes digitally.

Such minor changes do not constitute a new edition, but introduce typographical variations within an edition, which are of interest to collectors.

===Collectors&#x27; definition===

A common complaint of book collectors is that the bibliographer&#x27;s definition is used in a book-collecting context. For example, J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; remains in print in hardcover. The type is the same as the 1951 first printing, therefore all hardcover copies are, for the bibliographer, the first edition. Collectors would use the term for the first printing only.

First edition most often refers to the first commercial publication of a work between its own covers, even if it was first printed in a periodical: the complete text of Ernest Hemingway’s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; appeared in the September 1, 1952, issue of &quot;Life&quot;, yet the generally accepted &quot;first&quot; edition is the hardcover book Scribner’s published on September 8, 1952.

The term &quot;first trade edition,&quot; refers to the earliest edition of a book offered for sale to the general public in book stores. For example, Upton Sinclair&#x27;s 1906 novel &quot;The Jungle&quot; was published in two variant forms. A &quot;Sustainers&#x27; Edition&quot;, published by the Jungle Publishing Company, was sent to subscribers who had advanced funds to Sinclair. The first trade edition was published by Doubleday, Page to be sold in bookstores.

Many book collectors place maximum value on the earliest bound copies of a book—promotional advance copies, bound galleys, uncorrected proofs, and advance reading copies sent by publishers to book reviewers and booksellers. It is true that these are rarer than the production copies; but given that these were not printed from a different setting of type (just the opposite; the main purpose of galleys and proofs is to double-check the typeset matter that will be used for production), they are not different editions.

===Publisher definitions===
Publishers use &quot;first edition&quot; according to their own purposes, and consequently among them the designation is used very inconsistently. The &quot;first edition&quot; of a trade book may be the first iteration of the work printed by the publisher in question or the first iteration of the work that includes a specific set of illustrations or editorial commentary. This means that a &quot;second edition&quot; and subsequent &quot;third edition&quot; will not entail a huge shift from the initial edition but simply contain updates and revisions required with time.

Publishers of non-fiction, academic works, and textbooks generally distinguish between revisions of the text of the work, by typically citing the dates of the first and latest editions of the work in the copyright page. Exceptions to this rule of thumb include denominating as a &quot;second edition&quot; a new textbook that has a different format, title, or author because a previous textbook that shares only the same subject matter as the &quot;second edition&quot; is considered the first edition. The reason for this stretch of the definition is often for the short-term marketing advantage of the new textbook, because, although first editions are often considered more valuable than later editions to book collectors, being a subsequent edition of a previous textbook gives the impression that the textbook denominated as a subsequent edition is more authoritative.

==Other types==

=== Revised edition ===
Publishers sometimes denominate a new iteration of a work a &quot;revised edition&quot; or the &quot;(N)th edition, revised&quot; when the previous iteration has been editorially revised or updated yet the author or publisher does not want to denominate it the &quot;(N+1)th edition&quot; (&quot;N&quot; being the number of the previous edition) for some subjective reason. Conversely, a new iteration of a work that is not substantially different may be denominated a &quot;new edition&quot; or the &quot;(N+1)th edition&quot;.

The qualitative difference between a &quot;revised edition&quot; and a &quot;new edition&quot; is subjective. This is analogous to the way that software publishers may denominate an iteration &quot;version 3.7&quot; and the subsequent updated iteration &quot;version 4&quot; instead of &quot;version 3.8&quot;. The subjective judgment of the &quot;degree&quot; of the significance of the change made with the new iteration or the perceived marketing advantage of designating the new iteration as a specific number determines how the new iteration is numbered.

Therefore, the designation &quot;revised edition&quot; does not designate any quality or quantity of revision with certainty.

===Revised and updated edition===
When a non-fiction book is first published it sometimes instigates more research on its subject. The author may determine that new information justifies the revision of the book. A new iteration of the book would be published as a new edition, which may be denominated a &quot;revised and updated edition&quot;. However, as with the denomination of &quot;revised edition&quot;, the use of &quot;revised and updated edition&quot; manifests only the subjective choice of the publisher, which may be different from the publisher of a previous &quot;revised edition&quot; of the same work.

=== Co-edition ===
The basic definition of a &quot;co-edition&quot; is when two publishing houses publish the same edition of a book (or equivalent versions of an edition, for example, translated versions), simultaneously or near-simultaneously, usually in different countries. English and American editions may differ in spelling, and they sometimes have different titles. Some examples:
* An English-language edition, from the same plates, films, or files, may be published in different anglophone countries by different publishing companies. For example, Arms &amp; Armour Press in the UK and Stackpole Books in the U.S. published co-editions of various monographs on military matters. 
* A French-language novel published in France this year by a French publisher could become an English-language translation published in the U.S. next year by a U.S. publisher.

The motivation for co-editions has often been to use the existing distribution systems of the different publishers in each country rather than establishing new distribution systems.

Advancing IT and the globalization of publishing have been blurring the lines of what &quot;co-edition&quot; means. For example, anything published online is effectively published worldwide. Also, large multinational publishers now have existing distribution systems for their hardcopy books in many countries, so they don&#x27;t need to partner with other companies. They may issue a book under a different imprint for each country, but the imprints are parts of the same parent corporation. The actual manufacturing of the books may be done in China regardless of where the copies will be sold.

=== e-dition ===
The term &quot;e-dition&quot;, a play on the &quot;e-&quot;for-electronic prefix, has been used by various publishers to refer to various ideas, which include:
* The hardcopy book&#x27;s content posted online, fully searchable
* Supplemental online-only content for buyers of the hardcopy book
* Online-only publishing (no hardcopy distribution)
* Proprietary-format digital publication (e-books) for use in specialized hardware for reading the book (e-book readers)

===Library edition===
A library edition may appear to be the same as copies appearing in shops and almost certainly uses the same setting. However, the binding and hinges are made extra strong to allow for the greater wear and tear in library books. This is analogous to the &quot;police and taxi&quot; packages for automobiles, in which heavier brakes and other upgrades are made to withstand harsher-than-standard use and longer duty cycles.

===Book club edition===
A popular book is sometimes re-issued under the imprint of a book club. Often it is a new setting and with cheaper paper and binding. Any photographic illustrations in the original are either absent or reduced in number. Book club editions are sold to members at a good discount compared with the original issue price.

===Cheap edition===
After a book has exhausted the market at the high original price a publisher may issue a cheap edition themselves or sell the rights on to another publisher who will produce the book. A cheap edition typically uses a low-cost paper and is a paperback but they can be hardback. Also typically the size of the font is reduced to fit more words on a page to reduce the overall cost of the book. Naturally, for a cheap edition the author will receive a lower royalty but that may be compensated for by a greater volume of sales.

===Colonial edition===

During the peak of the British Empire, cheap editions of novels published in Britain would often be produced for sale in the colonies before other editions of the books were sold. The rationale was that books took a long time to export to the colonies, that readership in those settlements was avid, and that books were an effective means to disseminate British values. Australia was by far the largest consumer of colonial editions. Macmillan (London) published the largest number of colonial edition titles. They began in 1843 and persisted (in terms of pricing and trade) until the 1970s.

===Cadet edition===
A cadet edition is a cut down version of a book which is more simply written. It is intended for young readers but adults can read it too.

===Large print edition===
These editions are typically library editions but the font size of the text is much larger than usual so that persons with poor eyesight (often older persons) can more easily read the book. The large print books tend to be of a uniform size.

===Critical edition===
A critical edition is a scholarly publication, containing commentary, critique, and sometimes a full developmental history of the work from all available sources.

== Numbering ==
Because of the variation in quality, lower-numbered prints in an edition are sometimes favored as superior, especially with older works where the image was struck until the plate wore out. However the numbering of impressions in fact may well not equate at all to the sequence in which they were printed, and may often be the reverse of it.

In later times, printmakers recognized the value of limiting the size of an edition and including the volume of the edition in the print number (e.g., &quot;15/30&quot; for the 15th print in an edition of 30). Tight controls on the process to limit or eliminate variation in quality have become the norm. In monotyping, a technique where only two impressions at most can be taken, prints may be numbered 1/1, or marked &quot;unique&quot;. Artists usually print an edition much smaller than the plate allows, both for marketing reasons and to keep the edition comfortably within the lifespan of the plate. Specific steps may also be taken to strengthen the plate, such as electroplating intaglio images, which uses an electric process to put a very thin coat of a stronger metal onto a plate of a weaker metal.

The conventions for numbering prints are well-established, a limited edition is normally hand signed and numbered by the artist, typically in pencil, in the form (e.g.): 14/100. The first number is the number of the print itself. The second number is the number of overall prints the artist will print of that image. The lower the second number is, the more valuable and collectible the limited editions are likely to be, within whatever their price range is. Other marks may indicate that a print has been made in addition to the numbered prints of an edition. Artist&#x27;s proofs are marked &quot;A. P.&quot; or &quot;P/A&quot;, sometimes E. A. or E. d&#x27;A. (épreuve d&#x27;artiste); monoprints and uniquely hand-altered prints are marked &quot;unique&quot;; prints that are given to someone or are for some reason unsuitable for sale are marked &quot;H. C.&quot; or &quot;H/C&quot;, meaning &quot;hors de commerce&quot;, not for sale. These are usually prints reserved for the publisher, like Artist&#x27;s Proofs. The printer is also often allowed to retain some proof impressions; these are marked &quot;P. P.&quot; Finally, a master image may be printed against which the members of the edition are compared for quality: these are marked as &quot;bon à tirer&quot; or &quot;BAT&quot; (&quot;good to print&quot; in French). In all, the number of the main edition can represent 50% or less of the total number of good impressions taken.

Professional artist printmakers will sometimes limit an edition to several artist&#x27;s proof copies, including a &quot;bon à tirer&quot; print and then one unique copy designated as a &quot;one-off&quot; or &quot;1/1&quot; or &quot;one/off&quot;.

== Republication == 
Many commercially successful books have been republished, either by their original or other imprints. For this reason if a popular book is searched for in a large bookseller such as Amazon.com or a large library catalog such as WorldCat, often an array of different copyright years, publishers, editions, formats (hardcover, softcover, trade, and mass market), and so forth are observed. Because no universal authority or convention determines the exact distinction between a &quot;reprinting&quot; and &quot;republishing&quot; and whether a republishing is a different &quot;edition&quot;, the denotation of such denominations is ambiguous, at least at first glance.

==Legal status==

===UK===
Since 1956, typographical arrangements of published editions are protected by copyright law. &quot;Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988&quot; defines a published edition to mean &quot;a published edition of the whole or any part of one or more literary, dramatic or musical works&quot;.

It thus protects the publisher&#x27;s investment in typesetting, as well as the processes of design and selection that are reflected in the appearance of the text. It also covers modern editions of public domain works (such as the complete works of Shakespeare), and prohibits the reproduction of the layout (but not the work itself).

<doc id="609068" wikidata="Q258462" url="?curid=609068" title="Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick">
<text>Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (; May 2, 1950 – April 12, 2009) was an American academic scholar in the fields of gender studies, queer theory, and critical theory. Sedgwick published several books considered groundbreaking in the field of queer theory, and her critical writings helped create the field of queer studies, in which she was one of the most influential figures. Sedgwick&#x27;s essays became the framework for critics of poststructuralism, multiculturalism, and gay studies.

In her 1985 book &quot;Between Men&quot;, she analyzed male homosocial desire and English literature. In 1991, she published &quot;Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl&quot;, an article that received attention as part of an American culture war and criticism for associating the works of Jane Austen with sex. She coined the terms &quot;homosocial&quot; and &quot;antihomophobic&quot;.

Sedgwick argued that an understanding of virtually any aspect of modern Western culture would be incomplete if it failed to incorporate a critical analysis of modern homo/heterosexual definition. Drawing on feminist scholarship and the work of Michel Foucault, Sedgwick analyzed homoerotic subplots in the work of writers like Charles Dickens and Henry James. Her works reflected an interest in a range of issues, including queer performativity, experimental critical writing, the works of Marcel Proust, non-Lacanian psychoanalysis, artists&#x27; books, Buddhism and pedagogy, the affective theories of Silvan Tomkins and Melanie Klein, and material culture, especially textiles and texture.

==Biography==
Eve Kosofsky was raised in a Jewish family in Dayton, Ohio, and in Bethesda, Maryland. She had two siblings: a sister, Nina Kopesky and a brother, David Kosofsky. She received her undergraduate degree from Cornell University, where studied under Allan Bloom, among others, and her masters and Ph.D. from Yale University in the field of English. At Cornell, she was among the first women to be elected to live at the Telluride House, where she met her husband. She taught writing and literature at Hamilton College, Boston University, and Amherst College while developing a critical approach focusing on hidden social codes and submerged plots in familiar writers. She held a visiting lectureship at University of California, Berkeley, and taught at the School of Criticism and Theory when it was located at Dartmouth College. She was also the Newman Ivey White Professor of English at Duke University, and then a Distinguished Professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

During her time at Duke, Sedgwick and her colleagues were in the academic avant-garde of the culture wars, using literary criticism to question dominant discourses of sexuality, race, gender, and the boundaries of literary criticism. Sedgwick first presented her particular collection of critical tools and interests in the influential volumes &quot;Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire&quot; (1985) and &quot;Epistemology of the Closet&quot; (1990).

She married Hal Sedgwick in 1969. Sedgwick and her husband were happily married for nearly forty years, although from the beginning of their relationship until her death they lived independently from one another, usually in different states. Sedgwick described her relationship with her husband as &quot;vanilla&quot;. Her sexuality was confusing to some people as a queer theorist, that used queer as general term, but Sedgwick never publicly identified as anything aside from straight.

She received the 2002 Brudner Prize at Yale, a lifetime achievement award, for her extensive work in LGBT studies. In 2006, she was elected to the American Philosophical Society. She taught graduate courses in English as Distinguished Professor at The City University of New York Graduate Center (CUNY Graduate Center) until her death in New York City 

=== Death ===
In 1990, she found a lump on her breast while she was getting her post-doctoral fellowship. She underwent a radical mastectomy where all of her right breast and all of the lymph nodes from her right armpit were removed. She underwent chemotherapy. In the fall of 1996, cancer was found in Sedgwick&#x27;s spine as well. She received treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering for six months, where she had a series of radiation treatments to the portion of her spine affected by cancer.

By 2005, Sedgwick&#x27;s basic cancer treatment had been stable. In the beginning of 2006, it was found that Sedgwick&#x27;s cancer had resurfaced and spread again in her bone and liver. She died on April 12, 2009, at age 58 in New York City, after moving closer to her husband, though they continued to live separately.

==Ideas and literary criticism==
Sedgwick&#x27;s work ranges across a wide variety of media and genres; poetry and artworks are not easily separated from the rest of her texts. Disciplinary interests included literary studies, history, art history, film studies, philosophy, cultural studies, anthropology, women&#x27;s studies and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) studies. Her theoretical interests have been synoptic, assimilative, and eclectic.

===The queer lens===
Sedgwick aimed to make readers more alert to the &quot;potential queer nuances&quot; of literature, encouraging the reader to displace their heterosexual identifications in favor of searching out &quot;queer idioms.&quot; Thus, besides obvious double entendres, the reader is to realize other potentially queer ways in which words might resonate. For example, in Henry James, Sedgwick was said to have observed that words and concepts like &#x27;fond&#x27;, &#x27;foundation&#x27;, &#x27;issue&#x27;, &#x27;assist&#x27;, &#x27;fragrant&#x27;, &#x27;flagrant&#x27;, &#x27;glove&#x27;, &#x27;gage&#x27;, &#x27;centre&#x27;, &#x27;circumference&#x27;, &#x27;aspect&#x27;, &#x27;medal&#x27; and words containing the sound &#x27;rect&#x27;, including any words that contain their anagrams, may all have &quot;anal-erotic associations.&quot;

Sedgwick drew on the work of literary critic Christopher Craft to argue that both puns and rhymes might be re-imagined as &quot;homoerotic because homophonic&quot;; citing literary critic Jonathan Dollimore, Sedgwick suggests that grammatical inversion might have an equally intimate relation to sexual inversion; she suggested that readers may want to &quot;sensitise&quot; themselves to &quot;potentially queer&quot; rhythms of certain grammatical, syntactical, rhetorical, and generic sentence structures; scenes of childhood spanking were eroticised, and associated with two-beat lines and lyric as a genre; enjambment (continuing a thought from one line, couplet, or stanza to the next without a syntactical break) had potentially queer erotic implications; finally, while thirteen-line poems allude to the sonnet form, by rejecting the final rhyming couplet it was possible to &quot;resist the heterosexual couple as a paradigm&quot;, suggesting instead the potential masturbatory pleasures of solitude.

Sedgwick encouraged readers to consider &quot;potential queer erotic resonances&quot; in the writing of Henry James. Drawing on and herself performing a &quot;thematics of anal fingering and &#x27;fisting-as-écriture&#x27;&quot; (or writing) in James&#x27;s work, Sedgwick put forward the idea that sentences whose &quot;relatively conventional subject-verb-object armature is disrupted, if never quite ruptured, as the sac of the sentence gets distended by the insinuation of one more, qualifying phrase or clause&quot; can best be apprehended as either giving readers the vicarious experience of having their rectums penetrated with a finger or fist, or of their own &quot;probing digit&quot; inserted into a rectum. Sedgwick makes this claim based on certain grammatical features of the text.

===Reparative reading===
Sedgwick argues that much academic criticism springs from a hermeneutics of suspicion as coined by Paul Ricœur. She suggests that critics should instead approach texts and look at &quot;their empowering, productive as well as renewing potential to promote semantic innovation, personal healing and social change.&quot; This is Sedgwick&#x27;s idea of reparative reading which to her is the opposite of &quot;paranoid reading&quot; which focuses on the problematic elements in a given text. Reparative readings &quot;contrasts with familiar academic protocols like maintaining critical distance, outsmarting (and other forms of one-upmanship), refusing to be surprised (or if you are, then not letting on), believing the hierarchy, becoming boss.&quot; Rita Felski argues that reparative reading can be defined as &quot;a stance that looks to a work of art for solace and replenishment rather than viewing it as something to be interrogated and indicted.&quot; Felski&#x27;s claims around postcritique and postcritical reading draw heavily on Sedgwick&#x27;s reparative approach.

==Body of work==
Sedgwick published several foundational books in the field of queer theory, including &quot;Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire&quot; (1985), &quot;Epistemology of the Closet&quot; (1990), and &quot;Tendencies&quot; (1993). Sedgwick also coedited several volumes and published a book of poetry &quot;Fat Art, Thin Art&quot; (1994) as well as &quot;A Dialogue on Love&quot; (1999). Her first book, &quot;The Coherence of Gothic Conventions&quot; (1986), was a revision of her doctoral thesis. Her last book &quot;Touching Feeling&quot; (2003) maps her interest in affect, pedagogy, and performativity. Jonathan Goldberg edited her late essays and lectures, many of which are segments from an unfinished study of Proust. According to Goldberg, these late writings also examine such subjects as Buddhism, object relations and affect theory, psychoanalytic writers such as Melanie Klein, Silvan Tomkins, D.W. Winnicott, and Michael Balint, the poetry of C. P. Cavafy, philosophical Neoplatonism, and identity politics.

===&quot;Between Men: English Literature and Male Homosocial Desire&quot; (1985)===
According to Sedgwick, &quot;Between Men&quot; demonstrates &quot;the immanence of men&#x27;s same-sex bonds, and their prohibitive structuration, to male-female bonds in nineteenth-century English literature.&quot;

The book explores the oppressive effects on women and men of a cultural system where male-male desire could become intelligible only by being routed through nonexistent desire involving a woman.

Sedgwick&#x27;s &quot;male homosocial desire&quot; referred to all male bonds. Sedgwick used the sociological neologism &quot;homosocial&quot; to distinguish from &quot;homosexual&quot; and to connote a form of male bonding often accompanied by a fear or hatred of homosexuality, rejecting the then-available lexical and conceptual alternatives to challenge the idea that hetero-, bi- and homosexual men and experiences could be easily differentiated. She argued that one could not readily distinguish these three categories from one another, since what might be conceptualized as &quot;erotic&quot; depended on an &quot;unpredictable, ever-changing array of local factors.&quot;

===&quot;Epistemology of the Closet&quot; (1990)===
Sedgwick&#x27;s inspiration for &quot;Epistemology&quot; came from reading D. A. Miller&#x27;s essay, &#x27;Secret Subjects, Open Subjects&#x27;, subsequently included in &quot;The Novel and the Police&quot; (1988).

In &quot;Epistemology of the Closet&quot;, Sedgwick argues that &quot;virtually any aspect of modern Western culture, must be, not merely incomplete, but damaged in its central substance to the degree that it does not incorporate a critical analysis of modern homo/heterosexual definition.&quot; According to Sedgwick, the homo/heterosexual definition has become so tediously argued over because of a lasting incoherence &quot;between seeing homo/heterosexual definition on the one hand as an issue of active importance primarily for a small, distinct, relatively fixed homosexual minority ... [and] seeing it on the other hand as an issue of continuing, determinative importance in the lives of people across the spectrum of sexualities.&quot;

===&quot;Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl&quot;===
Sedgwick is perhaps best known not for her books, but rather for an article she published in 1991, &quot;Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl&quot;.&quot;&quot; The very title of her article attracted much attention from the media, most of it very negative. The conservative American cultural critic Roger Kimball used the title of her article as evidence of left-wing &quot;corruption&quot; in higher education in his 1990 book &quot;Tenured Radicals&quot;, when Sedgwick delivered a talk on her upcoming article at a conference of the Modern Language Association in late 1989. When &quot;Tenured Radicals&quot; was published in April 1990, Sedgwick&#x27;s little known speech at the Modern Language Association suddenly became famous. Sedgwick felt Kimball&#x27;s criticism of her in &quot;Tenured Radicals&quot; was highly unfair, given she had not actually written the article, which was published only in the summer of 1991, and therefore he dismissed her article only on the basis of the title. The British critic Robert Irvine wrote that much of the negative reaction that &quot;Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl&quot; generated, which became the subject of heated debate in the American &quot;culture war&quot; between liberals and conservatives, was due to the fact that many people could not accept the thesis that Jane Austen had anything to do with sex.

In her article, Sedgwick juxtaposed three treatments of female suffering, namely Marianne Dashwood&#x27;s emotional frenzy when Willoughby abandons her in &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, a 19th-century French medical account of the &quot;cure&quot; inflicted on a girl who liked to masturbate, and the critic Tony Tanner&#x27;s &quot;vengeful&quot; treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who had to be taught her place. Sedgwick argued that by the middle of the 18th century, the &quot;sexual identity&quot; of the onanist was well established in British disclosures and that Austen writing at the beginning of the 19th century would have been familiar with it. Sedgwick used Austen&#x27;s description of Marianne Dashwood, whose &quot;eyes were in constant inquiry&quot;, whose &quot;mind was equally abstracted from everything actually before them&quot; as she was &quot;restless and dissatisfied&quot; and unable to sit still. She then compared &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; with the 1881 document &quot;Onanism and Nervous Disorders in Two Little Girls&quot; where the patient X has a &quot;roving eye&quot;, &quot;cannot keep still&quot; and is &quot;incapable of anything&quot;. In Sedgwick&#x27;s viewpoint, the description of Patient X, who could not stop masturbating and was in a constant state of hysteria as the doctor tried to keep her from masturbating by such methods as having her hands tied together, closely matched Austen&#x27;s description of Marianne Dashwood. Sedgwick argued that both patient X and Dashwood were seen as suffering from an excess of sexuality that needed to be brought under control, arguing that though Elinor Dashwood did things considerably more gently than the doctor who repeatedly burned Patient X&#x27;s clitoris both were agents of discipline and control.

Sedgwick argued that the pleasure that Austen&#x27;s readers take from Marianne&#x27;s suffering is typical of Austen scholarship, which was centered around what Sedgwick called the central theme of a &quot;A Girl Being Taught a Lesson&quot;. As a prime example of what she called the &quot;Victorian sadomasochistic pornography&quot; of Austen scholarship, she used Tanner&#x27;s treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who has to be taught her place. Furthermore, Sedgwick accused Austen scholars of presenting Austen herself as a &quot;punishable girl&quot; full of a &quot;self-pleasing sexuality&quot; who was ever ready to be &quot;violated&quot;. Sedgwick ended her essay by writing that most Austen scholars wanted to de-eroticize her books, as she argued there was an implicit lesbian sexual tension between the Dashwood sisters, and scholars needed to stop repressing the &quot;homo-erotic longing&quot; contained in Austen&#x27;s novels.

===&quot;Tendencies&quot; (1993)===
In 1993, Duke University Press published a collection of Sedgwick&#x27;s essays from the 1980s and early 1990s. The book was the first entry in Duke&#x27;s influential &quot;Series Q&quot;, which was initially edited by Michele Aina Barale, Jonathan Goldberg, Michael Moon, and Sedgwick herself. The essays span a wide range of genres, including elegies for activists and scholars who died of AIDS, performance pieces, and academic essays on topics such as sado-masochism, poetics and masturbation. In &quot;Tendencies&quot;, Sedgwick first publicly embraces the word &#x27;queer&#x27;, defining it as: &quot;the open mesh of possibilities, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements of anyone&#x27;s gender, of anyone&#x27;s sexuality aren&#x27;t made (or &quot;can&#x27;t be&quot; made) to signify monolithically.&quot;

According to trans theorist Jay Prosser, &quot;Tendencies&quot; is also relevant, for it is here that Sedgwick &quot;has revealed her personal transgendered investment lying at and as the great heart of her queer project.&quot; He goes on to quote Sedgwick:

Nobody knows more fully, more fatalistically than a fat woman how unbridgeable the gap is between the self we see and the self as whom we are seen... and no one can appreciate more fervently the act of magical faith by which it may be possible, at last, to assert and believe, against every social possibility, that the self we see can be made visible as if through our own eyes to the people who see us... Dare I, after this half-decade, call it with all a fat &quot;woman&#x27;s&quot; defiance, my identity? – as a gay man.

===&quot;A Dialogue on Love&quot; (1999)===
In 1991, Sedgwick was diagnosed with breast cancer and subsequently wrote the book &quot;A Dialogue on Love&quot;. Sedgwick recounts the therapy she undergoes, her feelings toward death, depression, and her gender uncertainty before her mastectomy and chemotherapy. The book incorporates both poetry and prose, as well as Sedgwick&#x27;s own words and her therapist&#x27;s notes. Though the title connotes the Platonic dialogues, the form of the book was inspired by James Merrill&#x27;s &quot;Prose of Departure&quot; which followed a seventeenth-century Japanese form of persiflage known as &quot;haibun&quot;. Sedgwick uses the form of an extended, double-voiced &quot;haibun&quot; to explore possibilities within the psychoanalytic setting, particularly those that offer alternatives to Lacanian-inflected psychoanalysis, and new ways for thinking about sexuality, familial relations, pedagogy, and love. The book also reveals Sedgwick&#x27;s growing interest in Buddhist thought, textiles, and texture.

===&quot;Touching Feeling: Affect, Pedagogy, Performativity&quot; (2003)===
&quot;Touching Feeling&quot; is written as a reminder of the early days of queer theory, which Sedgwick discusses briefly in the introduction in order to reference the affective conditions—chiefly the emotions provoked by the AIDS epidemic—that prevailed at the time and to bring into focus her principal theme: the relationship between feeling, learning, and action. &quot;Touching Feeling&quot; explores critical methods that may engage politically and help shift the foundations for individual and collective experience. In the opening paragraph, Sedgwick describes her project as the exploration of &quot;promising tools and techniques for non dualistic thought and pedagogy.&quot; Sedgwick integrates works by Henry James, JL Austin, Judith Butler, Silvan Tompkins, and others, incorporating different levels of emotions and how they come together in our collective lives. &quot;Touching Feeling&quot; focuses on not only Sedgwick&#x27;s illness, but illness in general and how we deal with it.

<text>Lauren Gail Berlant (October 31, 1957 – June 28, 2021) was an American scholar, cultural theorist, and author who is regarded as &quot;one of the most esteemed and influential literary and cultural critics in the United States.&quot; Berlant was the George M. Pullman Distinguished Service Professor of English at the University of Chicago, where they taught from 1984 until 2021. Berlant wrote and taught issues of intimacy and belonging in popular culture, in relation to the history and fantasy of citizenship.

Berlant wrote on public spheres as they affect worlds, where affect and emotion lead the way for belonging ahead of the modes of rational or deliberative thought. These attach strangers to each other and shape the terms of the state-civil society relation.

==Early life and education ==
Berlant was born on October 31, 1957, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They graduated with a BA in English from Oberlin College in 1979, then an MA from Cornell University in 1983, and finally a PhD from Cornell in 1985, after they had already begun teaching at the University of Chicago. (They said student loans obliged them to continue straight through school without a break that would have triggered loan repayment.) Berlant&#x27;s dissertation was titled, &quot;Executing The Love Plot: Hawthorne and The Romance of Power&quot; (1985).

==Career==
Berlant taught at the University of Chicago from 1984 to 2021, becoming the George M. Pullman Distinguished Service Professor of English. The university awarded them a Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching (1989), a Faculty Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching and Mentoring (2005), and the Norman Maclean Faculty Award (2019).

Berlant&#x27;s other honors included a Guggenheim Fellowship and, for their book &quot;Cruel Optimism&quot;, the René Wellek Prize of the American Comparative Literature Association and the Alan Bray Memorial Book Award from the Modern Language Association (MLA) for the best book in queer studies in literature or cultural studies. Berlant was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2018.

Berlant was a founding member of Feel Tank Chicago in 2002, a play on think tank. They worked with many journals, including (as editor) &quot;Critical Inquiry&quot;. They also edited Duke University Press&#x27;s Theory Q series along with Lee Edelman, Benjamin Kahan, and Christina Sharpe.

==Works==
Berlant was the author of a national sentimentality trilogy beginning with &quot;The Anatomy of National Fantasy: Hawthorne, Utopia, and Everyday Life&quot; (University of Chicago Press, 1991). Based on their dissertation, the book looks at the formation of national identity as the relations between modes of belonging mediated by the state and law; by aesthetics, especially genre; and by the everyday life of social relations, drawing on Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s work to illustrate these operations.

&quot;The Queen of America Goes to Washington City: Essays on Sex and Citizenship&quot;—the title essay winning the 1993 Norman Foerster Award for best essay of the year in American literature—introduced the idea of the &quot;intimate public sphere&quot; and looks at the production of politics and publicness since the Reagan era by way of the circulation of the personal, the sexual, and the intimate. In his review, José Muñoz described it as both intersectional, following Kimberlé Crenshaw, and &quot;post-Habermassian&quot;, in the vein of work by Nancy Fraser and Berlant&#x27;s frequent collaborator Michael Warner. Berlant&#x27;s third book (though second in the trilogy), &quot;The Female Complaint: On the Unfinished Business of Sentimentality in American Culture&quot; was published by Duke University Press in 2008. The project initially began in the 1980s when Berlant noticed striking similarities in writing by Erma Bombeck and Fanny Fern, who skewered married life for women in nearly identical ways despite being separated by 150 years. Berlant pursued this mass cultural phenomenon of &quot;women&#x27;s culture&quot; as an originating site of “intimate publics&quot;, threading the everyday institutions of intimacy, mass society, and, more distantly and ambivalently, politics through fantasies rather than ideology. Berlant took up this project by examining especially melodramas and their remade movies in the first part of the twentieth century, such as &quot;Show Boat&quot;, &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, and &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;.

Berlant&#x27;s 2011 book, &quot;Cruel Optimism&quot; (Duke University Press) works its way across the U.S. and Europe to assess the level of contemporary crisis as neoliberalism wears away the fantasies of upward mobility associated with the liberal state. Cruel optimism manifests as a relational dynamic in which individuals create attachment as &quot;clusters of promises&quot; toward desired object-ideas even when they inhibit the conditions for flourishing and fulfilling such promises. Maintaining attachments that sustain the good life fantasy, no matter how injurious or cruel these attachments may be, allows people to make it through day-to-day life when the day-to-day has become unlivable. Elaborating on the specific dynamics of cruel optimism, Berlant emphasizes and maintains that it is not the object itself, but rather the relationship:

A relation of cruel optimism is a double-bind in which your attachment to an object sustains you in life at the same time as that object is actually a threat to your flourishing. So you can&#x27;t say that there are objects that have the quality of cruelty or not cruelty, it&#x27;s how you have the relationship to them. Like it might be that being in a couple is not a relation of cruel optimism for you, because being in a couple actually makes you feel like you have a grounding in the world, whereas for other people, being in a couple might be, on the one hand, a relief from loneliness, and on the other hand, the overpresence of one person who has to bear the burden of satisfying all your needs. So it&#x27;s not the object that&#x27;s the problem, but how we learn to be in relation.

An emphasis on the &quot;present&quot;, which Berlant describes as structured through &quot;crisis ordinariness&quot;, turns to affect and aesthetics as a way of apprehending these crises. Berlant suggests that it becomes possible to recognize that certain &quot;genres&quot; are no longer sustainable in the present and that new emergent aesthetic forms are taking hold that allow us to recognize modes of living not rooted in normative good life fantasies. Discussing crisis ordinariness, Berlant described it as their way &quot;of talking about traumas of the social that are lived through collectively and that transform the sensorium to a heightened perceptiveness about the unfolding of the historical, and sometimes historic, moment (and sometimes publics organized around those senses, when experienced collectively).&quot;

In 2019, Berlant published &quot;The Hundreds&quot; with Kathleen Stewart, a collection of brief writing (a hundred words or a multiple of a hundred words) on ordinary encounters, applying affect theory to moments of unexamined daily life. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Hua Hsu said the book &quot;calls to mind the adventurous, hybrid style of Fred Moten (the book includes a brief poem by him), Maggie Nelson, or Claudia Rankine, all of whom bend available literary forms into workable vessels for new ideas.&quot;

Berlant has edited books on &quot;Compassion&quot; (2004) and &quot;Intimacy&quot; (2001), which are interlinked with their seminal work in feminist and queer theory in essays like &quot;What Does Queer Theory Teach Us About X?&quot; (with Michael Warner, 1995), &quot;Sex in Public&quot; (with Michael Warner, 1998), &quot;Our Monica, Ourselves: Clinton and the Affairs of State&quot; (edited with Lisa Duggan, 2001), and &quot;Venus Inferred&quot; (with photographer Laura Letinsky, 2001).

==Death==
Berlant died of cancer in a Chicago hospice facility on June 28, 2021, at age 63. They are survived by their partner Ian Horswill.

Berlant&#x27;s papers are held at the Feminist Theory Archive of the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women at Brown University. Berlant began donating them in 2014.

<doc id="609074" wikidata="Q3826426" url="?curid=609074" title="Private sphere">
<text>The private sphere is the complement or opposite to the public sphere. The private sphere is a certain sector of societal life in which an individual enjoys a degree of authority and tradition, unhampered by interventions from governmental, economic or other institutions. Examples of the private sphere are high society, religion, sex, family and home.

In public-sphere theory, on the bourgeois model, the private sphere is that domain of one&#x27;s life in which one works for oneself. In that domain, people work, exchange goods, and maintain their families; it is therefore, in that sense, separate from the rest of society.

==Shifting boundaries==

The parameters separating public and private spheres are not fixed but vary both in (cultural) space and in time.

In the classical world, economic life was the prerogative of the household, only matters which could not be dealt with by the household alone entered the public realm of the polis. In the modern world, the public economy permeates the home, providing the main access to the public sphere for the citizen become consumer.

In classical times, crime and punishment was the concern of the kinship group, a concept only slowly challenged by ideas of public justice. Similarly in medieval Europe the blood feud only slowly gave way to legal control, whereas in modern Europe only the vendetta would still attempt to keep the avenging of violent crime within the private sphere.

Conversely, in early modern Europe, religion was a central public concern, essential to the maintenance of the state, so that details of private worship were hotly debated and controverted in the public sphere. Similarly, sexual behavior was subject to a generally agreed code publicly enforced by both formal and informal social control. In postmodern society, both religion and sex are now generally seen as matters of private choice.

===Gender politics===

Throughout many decades, the public and private sphere have incorporated traditional gender roles. Women were mostly kept to the private sphere by staying at home, taking care of their children and attending to house chores. They were not able to participate in the public sphere, which was dominated by men. 

The private sphere was long regarded as women&#x27;s &quot;proper place&quot; whereas men were supposed to inhabit the public sphere. Although feminist researchers such as V. Spike Peterson have discovered roots of the exclusion of women from the public sphere in ancient Athenian times, a distinct ideology that prescribed separate spheres for women and men emerged during the Industrial Revolution because of the severance of the workplace from places of residence that occurred with the build up of urban centres of work. Even writing was traditionally considered forbidden, as &quot;In the anxious comments provoked by the &#x27;female pen&#x27; it [was] easy enough to detect fear of the writing woman as a kind of castrating female whose grasp upon that instrument seems an arrogation of its generative power&quot;.

Feminists have challenged the ascription in a number of (not always commensurate) ways. In the first place, the slogan &quot;the personal is political&quot; attempted to open up the &#x27;private&#x27; sphere of home and child-rearing to public scrutiny as well as call to attention how the exclusion of women from the public sphere makes the private sphere political. At the same time, there was a new valorisation of the personal – of experiential knowledge and the world of the body – as against the (traditional) male preserves of public speech and theory.

All the while, due to the activism of feminists, the public sphere of work, business, politics and ideas were increasingly opened up to female participation.

==Critical theory==

Martin Heidegger argued that it is only in the private sphere that one can be one&#x27;s authentic self, as opposed to the impersonal and identikit They of the public realm.

Contrary to Heidegger, Hannah Arendt argued that (public) action is the only way to manifest &quot;who&quot; somebody is, as opposed to describing &quot;what&quot; they are. She argued that only in public realm it is possible to fully express oneself. 

Richard Sennett opposed what he saw as the Romantic idealization of the private realm of intimate relations, as opposed to the public sphere of action at a distance.

Deleuze and Guattari saw postmodernism as challenging the traditional split between private and public spheres, producing instead the supersaturated space of immediate presence and media-scrutiny of late capitalism.

<doc id="609079" wikidata="Q1151042" url="?curid=609079" title="Paper towel">
<text>A paper towel is an absorbent, disposable towel made from paper. In Commonwealth English, paper towels for kitchen use are also known as kitchen rolls, kitchen paper, or kitchen towels. For home use, paper towels are usually sold in a roll of perforated sheets, but some are sold in stacks of pre-cut and pre-folded layers for use in paper-towel dispensers. Unlike cloth towels, paper towels are disposable and intended to be used only once. Paper towels absorb water because they are loosely woven, which enables water to travel between the fibers, even against gravity (capillary effect). They have similar purposes to conventional towels, such as drying hands, wiping windows and other surfaces, dusting, and cleaning up spills. Paper towel dispensers are commonly used in toilet facilities shared by many people (such as at schools or shopping malls), as they are often considered more hygienic than hot-air hand dryers or shared cloth towels.

==History==
In 1907, the Philadelphia-based Scott Paper Company developed the first restroom tissues. They started the paper towel industry when they began selling Sani-Towels and used advertising to convince the public that paper towels were essential for personal hygiene. 

In 1919, William E. Corbin, Henry Chase, and Harold Titus began experimenting with paper towels in the Research and Development building of the Brown Company in Berlin, New Hampshire. By 1922, Corbin perfected their product and began mass-producing it at the Cascade Mill on the Berlin/Gorham line. This product was called Nibroc Paper Towels (Corbin spelled backwards). In 1931, the Scott Paper Company introduced their paper towel rolls for kitchens.

Paper towels are commonly used for drying hands in public bathrooms. In the 21st century, however, electric jet-air dryers have threatened their dominance. While there is no clear scientific consensus over which method is more hygienic, the paper towel industry and hand dryer manufacturers such as Dyson have each attempted to discredit each other by funding studies which spur sensationalist headlines and running advertisements. The public relations battle has also been fueled by animosity between both sides.

==Production==

Paper towels are made from either virgin or recycled paper pulp, which is extracted from wood or fiber crops. They are sometimes bleached during the production process to lighten coloration, and may also be decorated with colored images on each square (such as flowers or teddy bears). Resin size is used to improve the wet strength. Paper towels are packed individually and sold as stacks, or are held on a continuous roll, and come in two distinct classes: domestic and institutional. Many companies produce paper towels. Some common brand names are Bounty, Seventh Generation, Scott, Viva, and Kirkland brand among many others.

==Market==
Tissue products in North America, including paper towels, are divided into consumer and commercial markets, with household consumer usage accounting for approximately two thirds of total North American consumption. Commercial usage, or otherwise any use outside of the household, accounts for the remaining third of North American consumption. The growth in commercial use of paper towels can be attributed to the migration from folded towels (in public bathrooms, for example) to roll towel dispensers, which reduces the amount of paper towels used by each patron.

Within the forest products industry, paper towels are a major part of the &quot;tissue market&quot;, second only to toilet paper.

Globally, Americans are the highest per capita users of paper towels in the home, at approximately yearly consumption per capita (combined consumption approximately  per year). This is 50% higher than in Europe and nearly 500% higher than in Latin America. By contrast, people in the Middle East tend to prefer reusable cloth towels, and people in Europe tend to prefer reusable cleaning sponges.

Paper towels are popular primarily among people who have disposable income, so their use is higher in wealthy countries and low in developing countries.

Growing hygiene consciousness during the COVID-19 pandemic led to a boost in paper towel market growth.

==Environmental issues==
Paper towels are a global product with rising production and consumption. Being second in tissue consumption only to toilet paper (36% vs. 45% in the U.S.), the proliferation of paper towels, which are mostly non-recyclable, has globally adverse effects on the environment. However, paper towels made from recycled paper do exist, and are sold at many outlets. Some are manufactured from bamboo, which grows faster than trees.

Electric hand dryers are an alternative to using paper towels for hand drying. However, paper towels are quicker than hand dryers: after ten seconds, paper towels achieve 90% dryness, while hot air dryers require 40 seconds to achieve a similar dryness. Electric hand dryers may also spread bacteria to hands and clothing.

<text>Miklós Rózsa (; April 18, 1907 – July 27, 1995) was a Hungarian-American composer trained in Germany (1925–1931) and active in France (1931–1935), the United Kingdom (1935–1940), and the United States (1940–1995), with extensive sojourns in Italy from 1953 onward. Best known for his nearly one hundred film scores, he nevertheless maintained a steadfast allegiance to absolute concert music throughout what he called his &quot;double life&quot;.

Rózsa achieved early success in Europe with his orchestral &quot;Theme, Variations, and Finale&quot; (Op. 13) of 1933, and became prominent in the film industry from such early scores as &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1939) and &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940). The latter project brought him to Hollywood when production was transferred from wartime Britain, and Rózsa remained in the United States, becoming an American citizen in 1946.

During his Hollywood career, he received 17 Academy Award nominations including three Oscars for &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945), &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947), and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), while his concert works were championed by such major artists as Jascha Heifetz, Gregor Piatigorsky, and János Starker.

==Early life==

Miklós Rózsa was born in Budapest and was introduced to classical and folk music by his mother, Regina (née Berkovits), a pianist who had studied with pupils of Franz Liszt, and his father, Gyula, a well-to-do industrialist and landowner who loved Hungarian folk music. Both parents were of Jewish origin. Gyula&#x27;s father, Moritz Rosenberg, had changed the family name to &quot;Rózsa&quot; in 1887. Gyula Rózsa had inherited from his father a Budapest shoe factory, which brought him to the capital around 1900. Like his father, and despite his landowning status, Gyula had socialist leanings, which he expressed in a pamphlet entitled &quot;To Whom Does the Hungarian Soil Belong?&quot; Young Miklós grew up in a home of enlightened values and musical culture. His only sibling, Edith, was born seven years later.

Rózsa&#x27;s maternal uncle Lajos Berkovits, violinist with the Budapest Opera, presented young Miklós with his first instrument at the age of five. He later took up the viola and piano. By the age of eight he was performing in public and composing. He also collected folksongs from the area where his family had a country estate north of Budapest in an area inhabited by the Palóc Hungarians. While deeply admiring the folk-based nationalism of Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, Rózsa sought to find his own way as a composer. Fearing that Kodály&#x27;s dominance at Budapest&#x27;s Franz Liszt Academy tended to suppress individualism, he sought to study music in Germany. He enrolled at the University of Leipzig in 1925, ostensibly to study chemistry at the behest of his practical-minded father. Determined to become a composer, he transferred to the Leipzig Conservatory the following year. There he studied composition with Hermann Grabner, successor to Max Reger. He also studied choral music with (and later assisted) Karl Straube at the Thomaskirche, where Johann Sebastian Bach had once been the kapellmeister. Rózsa emerged from these years with a deep respect for the German musical tradition, which would always temper the Hungarian nationalism of his musical style.

Rózsa&#x27;s first two published works, the String Trio, Op. 1, and the Piano Quintet, Op. 2, were issued in Leipzig by Breitkopf &amp; Härtel. In 1929, he received his diplomas &quot;cum laude&quot;. During the Leipzig years he essayed a single-movement Violin Concerto and a lengthy Symphony, Op. 6. Neither work was published, and Rózsa was discouraged on a trip to Berlin when Wilhelm Furtwängler did not find time to consider the Symphony. Rozsa suppressed both works, but eventually allowed the Symphony (minus its lost scherzo) to be recorded in 1993.

For a time he remained in Leipzig as Grabner&#x27;s assistant, but at the suggestion of the French organist and composer Marcel Dupré, he moved to Paris in 1931. There he composed chamber music and a &quot;Serenade&quot; for small orchestra, Op. 10 (later greatly revised as &quot;Hungarian Serenade&quot;, Op. 25). It was premiered in Budapest by Ernő Dohnányi, who had advised Rózsa to offer a shorter work than the Symphony. Richard Strauss was in the audience, and his approval meant more to the young composer than the presence of Habsburg royalty and the prince regent, Miklós Horthy. The subsequent &quot;Theme, Variations, and Finale&quot;, Op. 13, was especially well received and was performed by conductors such as Charles Munch, Karl Böhm, Georg Solti, Eugene Ormandy, Bruno Walter and Leonard Bernstein.

==Film scoring career==

Rózsa was introduced to film music in 1934 by his friend, the Swiss composer Arthur Honegger. Following a concert which featured their respective compositions, Honegger mentioned that he supplemented his income as a composer of film scores, including the film &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1934). Rózsa went to see it and was greatly impressed by the opportunities the film medium offered. However, no film scoring opportunities presented themselves in Paris, and Rózsa had to support himself by reliance on a wealthy patron and by composing light music under the pseudonym Nic Tomay. It was not until Rózsa moved to London that he was hired to compose his first film score for &quot;Knight Without Armour&quot; (1937), produced by his fellow Hungarian Alexander Korda. Around the same time he also scored &quot;Thunder in the City&quot; (1937) for another Hungarian filmmaker, Ákos Tolnay, who had previously urged Rózsa to come to England. While the latter film was the first to open, Rózsa always cited the more prestigious Korda project as his film debut. He joined the staff of Korda&#x27;s London Films, and scored the studio&#x27;s epic &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; (1939). Korda and the studio&#x27;s music director, Muir Mathieson, brought Rózsa onto their Arabian Nights fantasy &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940) when the operetta-style approach of the original composer, Oscar Straus, was deemed unsuitable. Production was transferred to Hollywood when the war broke out, and Rozsa completed his score there in 1940.

The music earned him his first Academy Award nomination. While Korda remained in Hollywood, Rózsa was effectively the music director of his organization. In his capacity, he supervised the scoring of &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1942), and contributed at least one sequence of his own music. His own U.S. scores for Korda included &quot;Lydia&quot; (1940), &quot;That Hamilton Woman&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1942). From the last of these emerged &quot;The Jungle Book Suite&quot; for narrator and orchestra, which became popular as narrated by the film&#x27;s star, Sabu, and was soon recorded in New York by RCA. The 78-rpm album became the first substantial recording of Hollywood film music. It was later recorded with Rózsa conducting the Frankenland State Orchestra of Nuremberg and Leo Genn as narrator.

In 1943, now associated with Paramount, Rózsa scored the first of several collaborations with director Billy Wilder, &quot;Five Graves to Cairo&quot;. That same year he also scored the similarly themed Humphrey Bogart film &quot;Sahara&quot;. In 1944, his scores for a second Wilder collaboration, &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;, and for &quot;The Woman of the Town&quot;, both received Academy Award nominations.

In 1944, Rózsa was hired by producer David O. Selznick to compose the score for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Spellbound&quot;. The scoring process was contentious, with producer, director and composer all expressing considerable dissatisfaction with each other. Numerous changes were made in the editing by Audray Granville, Selznick&#x27;s assistant and de facto music director. The almost farcical history of artists at cross-purposes has been documented by Jack Sullivan (&quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s Music&quot;, 2006) and especially Nathan Platte (&quot;Making Music in Selznick&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, 2018). Nevertheless, the film was a hit after its release in late 1945. The combination of lush melody for the romance and frenzied expressionism for the suspense scenes proved irresistible. Rózsa&#x27;s pioneering (for Hollywood) use of the theremin contributed to the effect, and the attention it generated likely influenced his Academy Award nomination. Two of his other 1945 scores were also nominated, &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; and &quot;A Song to Remember&quot;, but the Oscar was awarded to &quot;Spellbound&quot;. Although Selznick was unhappy with the score, his innovative radio promotion of the music contributed to both the film&#x27;s and the composer&#x27;s success. Rózsa eventually arranged his themes as the &quot;Spellbound Concerto&quot;, which (in multiple versions) has enjoyed lasting success in concerts and recordings. The composer Jerry Goldsmith cited &quot;Spellbound&quot; as a key influence in his decision to seek a career in film music.

Rózsa enjoyed a fruitful three-film collaboration with the independent producer Mark Hellinger. For &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946) he wrote an ominous rhythmic figure that later became famous as the &quot;dum-da-dum-dum&quot; signature theme of the radio and television program &quot;Dragnet.&quot; A lawsuit eventually resulted in shared credit for Rózsa and the &quot;Dragnet&quot; composer, Walter Schumann. The affair is documented in Jon Burlingame&#x27;s &quot;TV&#x27;s Biggest Hits&quot; (1996). The prison drama &quot;Brute Force&quot; followed in 1947. On &quot;The Naked City&quot; (1948), Hellinger, on the day before he died, asked Rózsa to replace another composer&#x27;s music. Rózsa later compiled a six-movement suite of music from these three films in tribute to the producer. The &quot;Mark Hellinger Suite&quot; was later recorded as &quot;Background to Violence&quot;

Rózsa received his second Oscar for &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947), in which Ronald Colman, as a Shakespearean actor playing Othello, becomes murderously disturbed in his offstage life. Rózsa later adopted the title for his own memoir, signifying his desire to keep his personal music distinct from his movie career. That same year Rózsa and Eugene Zador arranged music by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov for the film &quot;Song of Scheherazade&quot;, about a fictional episode in the composer&#x27;s early life. Zador, a fellow Hungarian immigrant and a noted composer in his own right, assisted with the orchestration of most of Rózsa&#x27;s Hollywood film music. Also in 1947, Rózsa scored the music for the psychological thriller &quot;The Red House&quot;.

In 1948 Rózsa signed his only long-term studio contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (&quot;Double Life&quot;, p. 159). Previous associations with Paramount and Universal had been on a picture-to-picture basis. He was able to stipulate time off for his &quot;serious&quot; or personal composing, the right to decline assignments, and the right to teach a course on film music at the University of Southern California. The M-G-M affiliation, which lasted until 1962, resulted in new musical approaches for the studio&#x27;s output of historical romances and biblical &quot;epics.&quot; &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951) initiated the composer&#x27;s historical period. For this massive production, Hollywood&#x27;s most expensive film to that date, Rózsa went back to ancient Greek sources in an effort to simulate the music of antiquity. His account of this research was published in &quot;Film Music Notes&quot; 11:2 (1951) and has been reprinted frequently since (http://www.filmscoremonthly.com/notes/quo_vadis2.html). Other historical pictures from this era were set in Antiquity: &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (1953), &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959) and &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961); in the Middle Ages: &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952) and &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; (1953); in the Renaissance: &quot;Young Bess&quot; (1953) and &quot;Diane&quot; (1956); and in the nineteenth century: &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1949) and &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956).

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, widely considered Rózsa&#x27;s cinemusical masterpiece, is one of the longest film scores ever composed. Its intricate Wagnerian web of leitmotifs has received extensive study. Roger Hickman describes it as &quot;the last universally acknowledged score created in the classical Hollywood tradition prior to &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) . . . and one of the most influential scores on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; generation&quot; (&quot;Miklós Rózsa&#x27;s Ben-Hur: A Film Score Guide.&quot; Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, 2011. p 2). The film was Hollywood&#x27;s greatest success since &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, and Rózsa&#x27;s Academy Award was one of its record total of eleven. The &quot;Parade of the Charioteers&quot; became popular with bands across the country. 

In 1968, he was asked to score &quot;The Green Berets&quot;, after Elmer Bernstein turned it down due to his political beliefs. Rózsa initially declined the offer, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t do westerns.&quot; However, he agreed to compose the score after being informed, &quot;It&#x27;s not a Western, it&#x27;s an &#x27;Eastern&#x27;.&quot; He produced a strong and varied score, which included a nightclub vocal by a Vietnamese singer, Bạch Yến. However, one cue which incorporated stanzas of &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot;, was deleted from the film&#x27;s final edit.

His popular film scores during the 1970s included his last two Billy Wilder collaborations &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970) and &quot;Fedora&quot; (1978), the Ray Harryhausen fantasy sequel &quot;The Golden Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1973), the latter-day &quot;film noir&quot; &quot;Last Embrace&quot; starring Roy Scheider and the time-travel fantasy film &quot;Time After Time&quot; (1979), for which Rózsa won a Science Fiction Film Award. In his televised acceptance speech, Rózsa said that, of all the film scores he had ever composed, it was the one he had worked on the hardest.

For his first film in English, &quot;Providence&quot; (1977), Alain Resnais turned to Rózsa, whom he had admired especially for his work on the 1949 version of &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;. Rózsa later cited Resnais as one of the few directors in his experience who really understood the function of music in film.

After completing work on the music for the spy thriller &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; (1981), Rózsa&#x27;s last film score was for the black-and-white Steve Martin film &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid&quot; (1982), a comic homage to the &quot;film noir&quot; films of the 1940s, a genre to which Rozsa himself had contributed scores. Although Rózsa&#x27;s career as a composer for films ended following a stroke he suffered while on holiday in Italy later that year, he continued to compose various concert pieces thereafter; one of his last works being Sonata for Ondes Martenot, op. 45 (1989).

He returned to California at the behest of his son, and remained sequestered at his home for the remainder of his life.

==Death==
Rózsa died on July 27, 1995, and is buried at Forest Lawn in the Hollywood Hills. His wife, Margaret, died in 1999, aged 89.

==Works==

Rózsa&#x27;s first major success was the orchestral &quot;Theme, Variations, and Finale&quot;, Op. 13, introduced in Duisburg, Germany, in 1934 and soon taken up by Charles Munch, Karl Böhm, Bruno Walter, Hans Swarowsky, and other leading conductors. It was first played in the United States by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Hans Lange on October 28–29, 1937, and achieved wide exposure through a 1943 New York Philharmonic concert broadcast when Leonard Bernstein made his famous conducting debut.

By 1952, his film score work was proving so successful that he was able to negotiate a clause in his contract with MGM that gave him three months each year away from the film studio so that he could focus on concert music.

Rózsa&#x27;s Violin Concerto, Op. 24, was composed in 1953–54 for the violinist Jascha Heifetz, who collaborated with the composer in fine-tuning it. Rózsa later adapted portions of this work for the score of Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970). Rózsa&#x27;s Cello Concerto, Op. 32 was written much later (1967–68) at the request of the cellist János Starker, who premiered the work in Berlin in 1969.

Between his violin and cello concertos, Rózsa composed his Sinfonia Concertante, Op. 29, for violin, cello, and orchestra. The commissioning artists, Heifetz and his frequent collaborator Gregor Piatigorsky, never performed the finished work, although they did record a reduced version of the slow movement, called &quot;Tema con Variazoni&quot;, Op. 29a.

Rózsa also received recognition for his choral works. His collaboration with conductor Maurice Skones and The Choir of the West at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington, resulted in a commercial recording of his sacred choral works—&quot;To Everything There is a Season&quot;, Op. 20; &quot;The Vanities of Life&quot;, Op. 30; and &quot;The Twenty-Third Psalm&quot;, Op. 34—produced by John Steven Lasher and recorded by Allen Giles for the Entr&#x27;acte Recording Society in 1978.

==In popular culture==
The seventh variation (after the theme) of his &quot;Theme, Variations and Finale&quot;, Op. 13, was used as part of the soundtrack in four episodes—most notably &quot;The Clown Who Cried&quot;—of 1950s television series &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;.

In the Tom Clancy novel &quot;Red Rabbit&quot;, a fictional cousin of Rózsa&#x27;s, &quot;Jozsef Rozsa&quot;, appears as a minor character who is famous in-universe as a conductor of classical music.

<doc id="609082" wikidata="Q841691" url="?curid=609082" title="Bucegi Mountains">
<text>The Bucegi Mountains ( ) are located in central Romania, south of the city of Brașov. They are part of the Southern Carpathians group of the Carpathian Mountains. At , &quot;Omu&quot; is its highest point.

To the east, the Bucegi Mountains have a very steep slope towards the popular tourist destinations in the Prahova Valley, such as Bușteni and Sinaia. At a higher elevation is the Bucegi Plateau, where wind and rain have turned the rocks into spectacular figures such as the Sphinx and &quot;Babele&quot;.

The Bucegi is believed to be the Dacian holy mountain &quot;Kogainon&quot;, on which the God Zalmoxis resided in a cave.

==Name==
The exact origin of the name &quot;Bucegi&quot; is disputed by philologists. &quot;Buceag&quot; or &quot;bugeac&quot; seems to be the source of the name, a word designating in the language of mountain people both the moss in the forest and the wilderness or the junipers. An archaic version of the name &quot;Bucegi&quot; is &quot;Buceci&quot;, name still used today by elders in the mountains, and about which linguists say it is derived from &quot;huceag&quot;, &quot;buceag&quot; or &quot;bugeac&quot;.

Linguist Sextil Pușcariu claims that the name of Bucșoi, one of the mountains that reach the Omu Peak, derives from &quot;Buc&quot;, &quot;Bucur&quot;, just as &quot;Buceci&quot;, &quot;Bugeci&quot; derives from &quot;Buc&quot; with the same suffix like &quot;Măneciu&quot; or &quot;Moeciu&quot;. And &quot;Bucur&quot; is a genuine Dacian name. In Iorgu Iordan&#x27;s work, &quot;Toponimia romînească&quot;, the name of the mountains is derived from Slavic &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;beech&quot;.

==Ranges==
The mountains are grouped in three ranges:
* Bucegi Mountains, with highest point Omu Peak, at 
* Leaota Mountains, with highest point , at 
* Piatra Craiului Mountains, with highest point , at 

The Rucăr-Bran Pass separates the Piatra Craiului and Leaota ranges; it was marked by border crossings between Wallachia and Transylvania, and was defended by the Bran Castle.

== Tourism ==
The Bucegi Mountains are bordered by Prahova Valley, an area with the most ski resorts in Romania. Since 1935, part of the Bucegi Mountains has been included in the list of protected areas in Romania, with national park status.

=== Ski resorts ===
Among the most popular ski resorts within the Bucegi Mountains are Sinaia and Bușteni. Nicknamed the &quot;Pearl of the Carpathians&quot;, Sinaia offers the possibility of performing winter sports. Ski slopes within the resort are serviced by ski lift, accessible by cable car. The main tourist attractions are Peleș Castle, Pelișor Castle, Royal Station, Sinaia Monastery, Casino, and the George Enescu Memorial House.

Bușteni, located at an altitude of 800–900 m, features a diversified base of accommodation and meals (hotels, rest homes, chalets, tourist stops). A cable car links Silva Hotel and Babele Chalet, on the mountaintops. This area has unusual rock formations, such as the Sphinx and Babele. Bușteni is the starting point of trekking on some of the most attractive routes in the Bucegi Massif. In the winter months, Bușteni offers the possibility of practicing skiing and sleighing. There are ski slopes with varying degrees of difficulty. Bușteni is also a cultural point, featuring Cantacuzino Castle and Cezar Petrescu Memorial Museum. There is a trout farm in the area.

=== Rucăr-Bran Corridor ===

The Rucăr-Bran Corridor is a mountain pass that has the Bucegi Mountains on one side and the Piatra Craiului Mountains and Iezer-Păpușa Mountains on the other side.

=== Bucegi Natural Park ===

The Bucegi Mountains area, whereof exist references since the 15th century, has been proposed for protection in 1936, due to peerless landscapes and great diversity of plant and animal species. This proposal was taken up only in 1990, when materialized through the Minister&#x27;s order no. 7/1990. Bucegi Natural Park covers an area of 32,663 hectares across three counties (Dâmbovița, Prahova and Brașov), having more than 60% of the territory covered with forests.

<doc id="609093" wikidata="Q1005490" url="?curid=609093" title="Self-employment">
<text>Self-employment is the state of working for oneself rather than an employer. Tax authorities will generally view a person as self-employed if the person chooses to be recognised as such or if the person is generating income for which a tax return needs to be filed. In the real world, the critical issue for tax authorities is not whether a person is engaged in business activity (called &quot;trading&quot; even when referring to the provision of a service) but whether the activity is profitable and therefore potentially taxable. In other words, the trading is likely to be ignored if there is no profit, so occasional and hobby- or enthusiast-based economic activity is generally ignored by tax authorities. Self-employed people are usually classified as a sole proprietor (or sole trader), independent contractor, or as a member of a partnership.

Self-employed people generally find their own work rather than being provided with work by an employer and instead earn income from a profession, a trade, or a business that they operate. In some countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, the authorities are placing more emphasis on clarifying whether an individual is self-employed or engaged in disguised employment, in other words pretending to be in a contractual intra-business relationship to hide what is in fact an employer-employee relationship.

== Difference between self-employment, entrepreneurship, and startup ==
Self-employment provides work primarily for the founder of the business. The term entrepreneurship refers to all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to grow big or become registered, but the term startup refers to new businesses that intend to provide work and income for more than the founders and intend to have employees and grow large.

In summary:
* self-employment: an organization created with the primary intention to provide work to the founder.
* entrepreneurship: any new organization.
* startup: a temporary new organization created with the intention to get bigger or at least have employees.

== United States ==
Although the common perception is that self-employment is concentrated in a few service sector industries, like salespeople and insurance agents, research by the Small Business Administration has shown that self-employment occurs across a wide segment of the U.S. economy. Furthermore, industries that are not commonly associated as a natural fit for self-employment, such as manufacturing, have in fact been shown to have a large proportion of self-employed individuals and home-based businesses.

In the United States, any person is considered self-employed for tax purposes if that person is running a business as a sole proprietorship, independent contractor, as a member of a partnership, or as a member of a limited liability company that does not elect to be treated as a corporation. In addition to income taxes, these individuals must pay Social Security and Medicare taxes in the form of a SECA (Self-Employment Contributions Act) tax.

In 2016, the median income for individuals self-employed at their own incorporated businesses was $50,347. For individuals self-employed at their own unincorporated firms, this figure was $23,060.

=== Immigrants and ethnic minorities ===
Self-employment is relatively common among new immigrants and ethnic minorities in the United States. In the United States, immigrants tend to have higher rates of self-employment than native-born Americans regardless of race or ethnicity. But, self-employment in the United States is unevenly distributed across racial/ethnic lines. Immigrants and their children who self-identify as White have the highest probability of self-employment in lucrative industries such as professional services and finance. In contrast, racial and ethnic minorities are less likely than native-born Whites to be self-employed, with the exception of Asian immigrants who have a high rates of self-employment in low prestige industries such as retail trade and personal services. Much like the regular labor market, self-employment in the United States is stratified across racial lines. In general, self-employment is more common among immigrants than their second-generation children born in the United States. However, the second-generation children of Asian immigrants may continue to seek self-employment in a variety of industries and occupations.

=== Taxation ===
The self-employment tax in the United States is typically set at 15.30%, which is roughly the equivalent of the combined contributions of the employee and employer under the FICA tax. The rate consists of two parts: 12.4% for social security and 2.9% for Medicare. The Social Security portion of the self-employment tax only applies to the first $132,900 of income for the 2019 tax year. There is no limit to the amount that is taxable under the 2.9% Medicare portion of the self-employment tax. In fact, there is an additional Medicare tax rate of 0.9% when a self-employed individual earns above $200,000 (single). 

Generally, only 92.35% of the self-employment income is taxable at the above rates. Additionally, half of the self-employment tax, i.e., the employer-equivalent portion, is allowed as a deduction against income.

The 2010 Tax Relief Act reduced the self-employment tax by 2% for self-employment income earned in calendar year 2011, for a total of 13.3%. This rate will continue for income earned in calendar year 2012, due to the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011.
Self-employed persons sometimes declare more deductions than an ordinary employee. Travel, uniforms, computer equipment, cell phones, etc., can be deducted as legitimate business expenses.

Self-employed persons report their business income or loss on Schedule C of IRS Form 1040 and calculate the self-employment tax on Schedule SE of IRS Form 1040. Estimated taxes must be paid quarterly using form 1040-ES if estimated tax liability exceeds $1,000.

=== 401(k) retirement account ===
Self-employed workers cannot contribute to a company-run 401(k) plan of the type with which most people are familiar. However, there are various vehicles available to self-employed individuals to save for retirement. Many set up a Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP) IRA, which allows them to contribute up to 25% of their income, up to $54,000 (2017) per year. There is also a vehicle called the Self-Employed 401k (or SE 401(k)) for self-employed people. The contribution limits vary slightly depending on how the business is organized.

A defined-benefit plan is a third option that has high contribution limits and acts like a traditional pension plan. Sole proprietors can also opt for a SIMPLE IRA, which allows them to contribute to employee retirement plans as well as their own retirement plan.

=== Effects on income growth ===
Research has shown that levels of self-employment in the United States are increasing, and that under certain circumstances this can have positive effects on per capita income and job creation. According to a 2017 study by MBO Partners, the self-employed workforce generates $1.2 trillion in revenue for the U.S. economy, which is equal to about 6% of national GDP. A 2011 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Pennsylvania State University looked at U.S. self-employment levels from 1970 to 2000. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the absolute number of people registered as non-farm proprietors (NFPs) or self-employed in metropolitan counties grew by 244% between 1969 and 2006, and by 93% in non-metropolitan counties. In relative terms, the share of self-employed within the labor force grew from 14% in 1969 to 21% in 2006 in metropolitan counties, and from 11% to 19% in non-metropolitan counties.

In non-metropolitan counties, the study found that increased levels of self-employment were associated with strong increases in per capita income and job creation and significant reductions in family poverty levels. In 1969, the average income of non-farm proprietors was $6,758 compared to $6,507 earned by salaried employees; by 2006 the difference in earnings widened to $12,041 in favor of salaried employees. The study notes that the gap could be due to underreporting of income by the self-employed. Alternatively, low-productivity workers could be losing their jobs and are forced to be self-employed. Further, some research shows that higher local unemployment rates lead workers to self-select into self-employment, as does past unemployment experience.

== European Union ==
The European Commission defines a self-employed person as someone: &quot;pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law&quot;. In the exercise of such an activity, the personal element is of special importance and such exercise always involves a large measure of independence in the accomplishment of the professional activities. This definition comes from Directive 2010/41/EU on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity. This is in contrast to an employee, who is subordinate to and dependent on an employer.

In addition, Article 53 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides for the free movement of those taking up and pursuing activities as self-employed people. It stipulates: &quot;In order to make it easier for persons to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons, the Council shall… issue Directives for the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications&quot;.

The self-employment form of work does not group homogenous workers. As indicated by the European Commission in 2010, there are &quot;different understandings and definitions of the term self-employment across the countries, with a number of different subcategories defined: for instance, according to the legal status of the enterprise, whether the business has employees or not (employers versus own-account workers) and/or the sector in which the business operates. Some countries also make the distinction between self-employed status and the status of &#x27;dependent self-employed&#x27; (e.g. Spain, Italy), where the self-employed person works for only one client. Others distinguish self-employment which is carried out in addition to paid employment (e.g. Belgium)&quot;.

“Schijnzelfstandigheid” is a Dutch term that refers to &quot;false self-employment&quot; or &quot;bogus self-employment&quot;. It occurs when a person is officially classified as a freelancer or self-employed worker but, in practice, works as a regular employee under the same conditions, without the rights or benefits of an employee, such as paid leave, social security, or protection against dismissal.

This situation often arises when employers try to avoid taxes, social security contributions, or labor regulations by hiring workers as independent contractors instead of offering them a formal employment contract. Schijnzelfstandigheid can lead to legal issues, as it is considered an abuse of labor laws designed to protect workers.

In recent years, many countries, including the Netherlands, have tightened regulations to prevent and address this problem, seeking to ensure that workers who should be classified as employees are not wrongly treated as independent contractors.

The European Parliament Resolution on Social Protection for All has stated that: &quot;the absence of a clear national definition of self-employment increases the risk of false self-employment&quot; and the European Parliament Resolution on the Renewed Social Agenda invites Member States to take initiatives that would &quot;lead to a clear distinction between employers, genuine self-employed and small entrepreneurs on the one hand and employees on the other&quot;.

Self-employment is mostly regulated at national level only. Each authority and individual body applies its own legal and regulatory framework provisions, which may vary depending on their remit or policy area (tax law, social security, business law, employment market, insurance). The provisions related to self-employment vary therefore widely between the countries. As indicated by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) in 2014, the diversity of the self-employed has attracted diverse forms of regulation, mainly decided at national level: &quot;EU employment law addresses the self-employed mainly in narrowly specific areas such as free movement and equal treatment&quot;.

As recommended by the European Forum of Independent Professionals (EFIP), the EU, employers&#x27;, employees&#x27; and self-employment representatives should adopt a Europe-wide joint recognition of genuine self-employment and a common definition that includes a shared terminology for the various sectors.

== United Kingdom ==
A self-employed person in the United Kingdom can operate as a sole trader or as a partner in a partnership (including a limited liability partnership or &quot;LLP&quot;) but not through an incorporated limited (or unlimited) liability company. It is also possible for someone to form a business that is run only part-time or concurrently while holding down a full-time job.

According to a 2016 study by the McKinsey Global Institute, there are 14 million &quot;independent workers&quot; in the United Kingdom, although the House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee reported in 2017 that 5 million people, 15% of the workforce, were self-employed. The Office for National Statistics referred to a &quot;rapid growth&quot; in self-employment between 2001 (3.3 million people, or 12% of the workforce) and 2017 (4.8 million people, or 15.1% of the workforce, with London, Yorkshire and the Humber and the South East regions exhibiting the greatest rates of increase. Many people living with disabilities choose to be self-employed.

Self-employment, while popular, does come with several legal responsibilities. When remote working, clearance may sometimes be required from the local authority to use part of the home as business premises. If the self-employed person holds records of customers or suppliers in any electronic form they are required to register with the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office. Other legal responsibilities include statutory public liability insurance cover, modifying premises to be disabled-friendly, and the proper recording and accounting of financial transactions. Free advice on the range of responsibilities is available from government operated Business Link centres.

The UK government has stated that &quot;self-employment is not the right choice for everyone&quot;.

The Office for National Statistics has observed that information on levels of income from self-employment is limited and largely comes from surveys.

The House of Commons Work and Pensions Committee reported in May 2017 that some self-employment could be described as &quot;bogus&quot;, noting that &quot;a minority of companies&quot; promote the idea that flexibility in employment can only be secured through self-employment, and that such misuse of self-employment status &quot;passes the burden of safety net support to the welfare state at the same time as reducing tax revenue&quot;.

<text>The TV Week Logie Awards (known colloquially as The Logies) is an annual ceremony celebrating and honouring the best shows and stars in Australian television, sponsored and organised by the magazine &quot;TV Week&quot;. The event is telecast live and billed as &quot;television&#x27;s night of nights&quot;. The first ceremony was hosted in 1959 as the TV Week Awards.

The Gold Logie is the most prestigious award and the industry&#x27;s highest honour; it&#x27;s awarded to the &quot;Most Popular Personality on Australian Television&quot; for the previous year. The award receives much publicity and media attention. Awards are presented in 20 categories, representing both industry and public voted prizes

The event has been strongly associated with the Nine Network, who have hosted the ceremony on the most occasions, and TV and former radio personality Bert Newton, particularly in the early days, who served as a solo host of the ceremony on 17 occasions, with a constant run from 1966 until 1980 and as co-host on three other occasions. Over the years, the Logies have been hosted in Melbourne and Sydney. From 2018 to 2022, the ceremony was held on the Gold Coast before the 2023 ceremony was announced as moving to Sydney for the first time in 37 years.

==History==
Known from their inception as the TV Week Awards, the awards were instigated by &quot;TV Week&quot; magazine with the first voting coupons provided in the magazine in late 1958, two years after the introduction of television in Australia. The first awards were presented on 15 January 1959 on an episode of &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot;. Only Melbourne television personalities were nominated and awards were given in eight categories, including two for American programs.

The most prestigious award in 1959 was Star of the Year presented to IMT host Graham Kennedy. The following year, Kennedy coined the name &quot;Logie&quot; Awards, to honour the Scottish engineer and innovator who contributed to the development of television as a practical medium, John Logie Baird.

The Logie statuette was designed by Alec De Lacy, chief designer for Melbourne-based trophy makers KG Luke Ltd. The first &quot;Gold Logie&quot;, the equivalent of the &quot;Star of the Year Award&quot;, was presented in 1960, and again won by Graham Kennedy. The record for most &quot;Gold Logie&quot; wins—at five apiece—is a tie between Kennedy and Ray Martin.

The 2020 and 2021 ceremonies were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Logie institutions and milestones==
==Logie Hall of Fame==

The prestigious Logie Hall of Fame was first introduced in 1984; former conductor, turned television producer and pioneer and founder of Crawford Productions, Hector Crawford was the first inductee. The induction was a posthumous honour for TV cameraman Neil Davis, actor Maurie Fields, conservationist Steve Irwin, news anchor Brian Naylor, journalist Peter Harvey and television executive Brian Walsh.

Rebecca Gibney was the fourth woman to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, joining former recipients Ruth Cracknell, Noni Hazlehurst and Kerri-Anne Kennerley. The Logies have been criticised for its lack of women inductees in the category

===TV programs===
These are the only programs that have been inducted into the Hall of Fame.

==Nomination and voting procedures==
===Public voting===
Voting for the &quot;Most Popular&quot; Logie categories is done using an online form, or by SMS (short message service) voting for the final nominees. Ten of the Logie Award categories are fan awards. In the past, the &quot;Most Popular&quot; Logies categories were voted by the readers of &quot;TV Week&quot; magazine using a coupon.

SMS (short message service) voting was introduced in 2006 for the Gold Logie. In 2008, Internet votes could be cast for the first time without having to buy a copy of the &quot;TV Week&quot; magazine.

Before 2018, public voting usually lasted for four weeks, beginning in December or January, while the ceremony itself was in late April or early May. Since 2018, voting begins in March and the ceremony is held in July.

===Industry voting===
The &quot;Most Outstanding&quot; categories are voted on by a jury comprising members of the Australian TV industry peers. There were 15 categories in the industry awards at the &quot;Logie Awards of 2018&quot;.

==Eligibility==
To be eligible to receive a Logie, a program must be Australian produced, set in Australia and have a predominantly Australian cast. Although in other years there has been a Logie for overseas programs, these awards are no longer part of the awards. People eligible for a Logie must have appeared on an Australian-produced show that was broadcast on Australian television in the previous year.

There are long-held suspicions that network publicists engage in mass voting to rig the results. However, no hard evidence had emerged for this, other than the experiment by the satirical newspaper &quot;The Chaser&quot;, who attempted to have low-profile SBS newsreader Anton Enus nominated for the Gold Logie. They did so by getting their small readership to buy copies of &quot;TV Week&quot; and vote for Enus for the award. While the attempt failed (they came &quot;reasonably close&quot;, to earning a nomination for Enus, according to a &quot;&quot;TV Week&quot; Insider&quot;), their failure gives some cause for the widespread derision in the industry (particularly the &#x27;quality&#x27; end) towards the popular-vote awards.

Community television, Channel 31, personalities and shows are eligible for nomination for Logies, however since their audiences are far smaller than those of the commercial channels and public broadcasters, they are at a tremendous disadvantage. For a time they had their own community television awards, known as the Antenna Awards. Despite this, in 2009 the Logies were dogged by minor controversy after organisers refused to allow an acclaimed community television show, &quot;The Bazura Project&quot;, to be nominated in the category of Outstanding Comedy Show, stating &quot;As &quot;TV Week&quot; does not cover community television within the magazine, we are unable to consider individual programs on this platform.&quot; The ABC&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; program first reported the story on Monday 9 March 2009, with many media outlets covering the growing support for the community television program since.

==Logies ceremonies by year==

==Awards ceremony==
The Logie Awards ceremony is televised and became generally more elaborate as years went by. The awards have mostly been held in a ballroom, rather than a theatre, which is common for the Emmy Awards and Academy Awards. Dinner is served just before the ceremony and drinks are served during the ceremony.

Bert Newton, who has won the Gold Logie four times, hosted the awards a total of 19 times. GTV-9/Nine Network is also strongly associated with the history of the Logies. Nine has hosted the awards 46 times in their 60-year history.

The Seven Network will take over from the Nine Network as host broadcaster. Seven had last broadcast the Logie Awards in 1995.

==Controversies==
In 1973, American actor Michael Cole generated controversy after accepting an award while apparently drunk, uttering the word &quot;shit&quot; in a short, incoherent acceptance speech. This was the first time such profanity had been said on Australian television. According to Bert Newton, Channel Nine received thousands of complaints about the use of the word, however, when it was edited for the repeat transmission Newton stated &quot;they got double the calls complaining it had been dropped.&quot;

In 1979, during a notable appearance with Muhammad Ali as co-presenter, Newton made a comment &quot;I like the boy!&quot; (in reference to a series of TV advertisements Bert had recently done). Ali became upset at the comment, as the term &quot;boy&quot; carried negative racial connotations for many black Americans, although Newton was oblivious to this use of the term and claimed this was not his intention. After realising his faux pas, Newton quickly apologised to Ali on stage.

The most difficult guest to interact with, according to Newton, was Vic Morrow in 1967. He would just stand there saying nothing, silently handing out the Logies. According to Bert, &quot;every so often, I&#x27;d say &#x27;how are you going, Vic?&#x27; and he would just nod his head.&quot;

Grant Denyer&#x27;s 2018 Gold Logie win has proved controversial with people believing he only won because of Tom Gleeson&#x27;s campaign. Gleeson has shrugged off those suggestions.

Tom Gleeson&#x27;s 2019 Gold Logie win has proved controversial with him not being so humble by the victory.

The trial of the man accused of raping Brittany Higgins was delayed because of comments from Lisa Wilkinson&#x27;s acceptance speech.

Every year before public voting opens, major commercial networks ABC, SBS, Seven, Nine, and 10 are restricted in the number of personalities and programs they can submit for consideration in the publicly voted category, including up to 10 names in both the Most Popular Actor and Actress categories, 15 names for Most Popular Presenter and five programs for Most Popular Drama. These restrictions often are introduced over those who are not listed in the voting form, and as a result, they are not eligible to be nominated for an award.

==Live performers==
Many local and overseas performers have appeared at the Logie Awards ceremony. While it had been a tradition to choose performers with a television connection, this has not always been the case.

In 2001, Ricky Martin was the headline performer. In 2002, Destiny&#x27;s Child performed, with Elton John and Shakira making appearances. In 2004, it was Michael Bublé with Delta Goodrem. In 2011, Katy Perry performed and presented an award, while 2012 saw One Direction and Delta Goodrem perform on the night with appearances from Flo Rida, Tony Bennett and Seal. In 2013, it was Bruno Mars and 2014 Ed Sheeran.

<text>Cotton swabs (American English) or cotton buds (British English) are wads of cotton wrapped around a short rod made of wood, rolled paper, or plastic. They are most commonly used for ear cleaning, although physicians do not recommend using them. Other uses for cotton swabs include first aid, cosmetics application, cleaning, infant care, and crafts. Some countries have banned the plastic-stemmed versions in favor of biodegradable alternatives over concerns about marine pollution.

== History ==
The first mass-produced cotton swab was developed in 1923 by Polish-American Jew Leo Gerstenzang after he watched his wife attach wads of cotton to toothpicks to clean their infant&#x27;s ears. His product was originally named &quot;Baby Gays&quot; in recognition of their being intended for infants before being renamed &quot;Q-tips Baby Gays&quot;, with the &quot;Q&quot; standing for &quot;quality&quot;. The product eventually became known as &quot;Q-tips&quot;, which went on to become the most widely sold brand name of cotton swabs in North America. The term &quot;Q-tip&quot; is often used as a genericized trademark for a cotton swab in the United States and Canada. The Q-tips brand is owned by Elida Beauty. It was formerly owned by Unilever and had over $200 million in US sales in 2014. &quot;Johnson&#x27;s buds&quot; are made by Johnson &amp; Johnson.

However, according to the United States Patent Case (C-10,415) &quot;Q-Tips, Inc. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, 108 F. Supp. 845 (D.N.J. 1952)&quot;, it would appear that the first commercial producer of cotton-tipped applicators was Mrs. Hazel Tietjen Forbis, who manufactured them in her home. She also owned a patent on the article, numbered 1,652,108, dated December 6, 1927, and sold the product under the appellation Baby Nose-Gay. In 1925, Leo Gerstenzang Co., Inc. purchased an assignment of the product patent from Mrs. Forbis. On January 2, 1937, Q-Tips, Inc&#x27;s president, Mr. Leo Gerstenzang, and his wife Mrs. Ziuta Gerstenzang formed a partnership and purchased from Mrs. Forbis &quot;All merchandise, machinery, and fixtures now contained in the premises 132 W. 36th Street and used by said Q-Tips, Inc., for the manufacture of Q-Tips or medicated swabs together with the accounts receivable of said Q-Tips, Inc.&quot; The contract recited that Q-Tips, Inc. was the owner of patents covering the manufacture of applicators.

Originally, when cotton-tipped applicators were made by Mrs. Forbis, they were sold under the name of Baby Nose-Gays. In 1925, after The Leo Gerstenzang Co., Inc. purchased an assignment of the product patent from Mrs. Forbis, the packages of applicators were labelled Baby-Gays. In 1926, the legend was changed to read &quot;Q-Tips Baby Gays&quot;, and in 1927 an application was made to register the mark &quot;Q-Tips Baby Gays&quot;. Sometime after 1926, the words &quot;Baby Gays&quot; were dropped and the concern began to develop &quot;Q-Tips&quot; as its identifying mark, applying for registration on September 14, 1933. Packages were made up using blue paper with pictures of double-tipped applicators upon them, features which have been the basis for the Q Tips packaged sign since. The design of the crossed applicators was made by dropping them and then photographing the resulting pattern.

== Description ==
The traditional cotton swab has a single tip on a wooden handle, and these are still often used, especially in medical settings. They are usually relatively long, about . These often are packaged sterile, one or two to a paper or plastic sleeve. The advantage of the paper sleeve and the wooden handle is that the package can be autoclaved to be sterilized (plastic sleeves or handles would melt in the autoclave).

Cotton swabs manufactured for home use are usually shorter, about long, and double-tipped. The handles were first made of wood and then made of rolled paper, which is still the most common (although tubular plastic is also used). They are often sold in large quantities, 100 or more in a container.

Plastic swab stems exist in a wide variety of colors, such as blue, pink, or green. However, the cotton itself is traditionally white.

== Use ==
The most common use for cotton swabs is to clean the ear canal by removing earwax. This use is usually against manufacturer instructions. Cotton swabs are also commonly used for cosmetic purposes such as applying and removing makeup and touching up nail polish, as well as for household uses such as cleaning and arts and crafts.

Medical-type swabs are often used to take microbiological cultures. The swabs are rubbed onto or into the infected area, then wiped across the culture medium, such as an agar plate, where bacteria from the swab may grow. They are also used to take DNA samples, most commonly by scraping cells from the inner cheek in the case of humans. They can be used to apply medicines to a targeted area, to selectively remove substances from a targeted area, or to apply cleaning substances like Betadine. They are also used as applicators for cosmetics, ointments, and other substances.

A related area is the use of swabs for microbiological environmental monitoring. Once taken, the swab can be streaked onto an agar plate, or the contents of the tip removed by agitation or dilution into the broth. The broth can be filtered or incubated and examined for microbial growth.

Cotton swabs are also often used outside of the field of personal hygiene:

* They are often used in the construction of plastic model kits, for various applications during the application of decals or painting. Special brands of cotton swabs exist for this purpose, characterised by sturdier cotton heads and varied shapes of those heads.
* They can be used in the dyne test for measuring surface energy. This use is problematic, as manufacturers differ in the binders they use to fix the cotton to the stem, affecting the outcome of the test.
* They are frequently used for cleaning the laser diode lens of an optical drive in conjunction with rubbing alcohol. Similarly, they are used for cleaning larger computer parts such as video cards and fans. They were also widely used in the past to clean video game cartridges.

=== Role in medical diagnostics ===
The importance of swab technology in medical diagnostics is immense. Swabs are a primary tool for collecting patient specimens, vital for accurately detecting pathogens, DNA sampling, and disease diagnosis. The collection&#x27;s precise nature and the swab&#x27;s quality are critical in ensuring reliable test results.

Nasopharyngeal swabs for respiratory virus detection swabs for efficient DNA material collection swabs to assess the presence of microbial infection in sterility and prevention of contamination.

== Medical risks ==
Using cotton swabs in the ear canal has no associated medical benefits and poses definite medical risks. Cerumen (ear wax) is a naturally occurring, normally extruded, product of the external auditory canal that protects the skin inside the ear, serves beneficial lubrication and cleaning functions, and provides some protection from bacteria, fungi, insects, and water.

Attempts to remove cerumen with cotton swabs may result in cerumen impaction, a buildup or blockage of cerumen in the ear canal, which can cause pain, hearing problems, ringing in the ear, or dizziness, and may require medical treatment to resolve. The use of cotton swabs in the ear canal is one of the most common causes of perforated eardrum, a condition which sometimes requires surgery to correct.

A 2004 study found that the &quot;use of a cotton-tip applicator to clean the ear seems to be the leading cause of otitis externa in children and should be avoided.&quot; Instead, wiping wax away from the ear with a washcloth after a shower almost completely cleans the outer one-third of the ear canal, where earwax is made. In the US between 1990 and 2010, an estimated 263,338 children went to hospital emergency rooms for cotton swab injuries, accounting for an estimated annual hospitalization of 13,167 children.

==Environmental impact==
Plastic cotton swabs are often flushed down the toilet, increasing the risk of marine pollution. Some manufacturers and retailers have stopped making and selling plastic swabs and are only selling biodegradable paper versions.

The European Union instated a ban on the use of plastic-stemmed cotton swabs in 2021. Italy had previously instated a ban in 2019 and Monaco in 2020. England, Scotland, Wales, and the Isle of Man each instated a ban between 2019 and 2021.

<text>Alpheus Felch (September 28, 1804June 13, 1896) was the fifth governor of Michigan and U.S. Senator from Michigan.

==Early life==
Felch was born in Limerick (in modern-day Maine, then a part of Massachusetts). He was left an orphan at the age of three and lived with his grandfather Abijah Felch, a veteran of the American Revolution. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, and graduated from Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, in 1827. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in Bangor, Maine, and practiced in Houlton, Maine, from 1830 to 1833.

==Political career==
Felch moved to Monroe, Michigan, in 1833 and continued the practice of law. In 1835 he was the aid-de-camp to General Joseph Brown during the mustering of troops for the Ohio–Michigan Boundary Dispute (the Toledo War). He was elected three times to the Michigan State House of Representatives, serving from 1835 to 1837. He was appointed state bank commissioner in 1838 and resigned in 1839. As bank commissioner, he did much to expose frauds which had been made possible by a general wildcat banking law which he had opposed, and which was afterward declared unconstitutional by the Michigan Supreme Court. He was state auditor general for a few weeks in 1842 before being appointed associate justice of the Michigan Supreme Court in 1842, where he served until his resignation in 1845, after being elected governor. He served as Governor of Michigan from 1846 to 1847 and during those fourteen months, state statutes were amended and the state capital was relocated to Lansing.

Felch resigned as governor on March 3, 1847, after being elected by the Michigan legislature as a Democrat to the United States Senate. He served in the 30th, 31st and 32nd Congresses, from March 4, 1847 to March 3, 1853. In the U.S. Senate, he was chairman of the committee on public lands for four years.

In March 1853, he was appointed by U.S. President Franklin Pierce to the land claims commission for California to settle Spanish and Mexican land claims arising from the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which ended the Mexican–American War and served as president of the commission until 1856. He returned to live in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that year and made an unsuccessful attempt at a non-consecutive term as governor against the Republican incumbent Kinsley S. Bingham. He resumed his law career and served as the Tappan Professor of Law at the University of Michigan from 1879 to 1883.

==Death and legacy==

He died at his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan at the age of 91, and is interred at Forest Hill Cemetery along with his wife, Lucretia.

Alpheus Felch is the namesake of Felch Township, Michigan. Felch Park, on the University of Michigan campus, is also named for him.

<doc id="609099" wikidata="Q407181" url="?curid=609099" title="Gastrin">
<text>Gastrin is a peptide hormone that stimulates secretion of gastric acid (HCl) by the parietal cells of the stomach and aids in gastric motility. It is released by G cells in the pyloric antrum of the stomach, duodenum, and the pancreas.

Gastrin binds to cholecystokinin B receptors to stimulate the release of histamines in enterochromaffin-like cells, and it induces the insertion of K+/H+ ATPase pumps into the apical membrane of parietal cells (which in turn increases H+ release into the stomach cavity). Its release is stimulated by peptides in the lumen of the stomach.

==Physiology==

===Genetics===

In humans, the &quot;GAS&quot; gene is located on the long arm of the seventeenth chromosome (17q21).

===Synthesis===
Gastrin is a linear peptide hormone produced by G cells of the duodenum and in the pyloric antrum of the stomach. It is secreted into the bloodstream. The encoded polypeptide is preprogastrin, which is cleaved by enzymes in posttranslational modification to produce progastrin (an intermediate, inactive precursor) and then gastrin in various forms, primarily the following three: 
* &quot;gastrin-34&quot; (&quot;big gastrin&quot;)
* &quot;gastrin-17&quot; (&quot;little gastrin&quot;)
* &quot;gastrin-14&quot; (&quot;minigastrin&quot;)

Also, pentagastrin is an artificially synthesized, five amino acid sequence identical to the last five amino acid sequence at the C-terminus end of gastrin.
The numbers refer to the amino acid count.

===Release===
Gastrin is released in response to certain stimuli. These include:
* stomach antrum distension
* vagal stimulation (mediated by the neurocrine bombesin, or GRP in humans)
* the presence of partially digested proteins, especially amino acids, in the stomach. Aromatic amino acids are particularly powerful stimuli for gastrin release.
* hypercalcemia (via calcium-sensing receptors)

Gastrin release is inhibited by:
* the presence of acid (primarily the secreted HCl) in the stomach (a case of negative feedback)
* somatostatin also inhibits the release of gastrin, along with secretin, GIP (gastroinhibitory peptide), VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide), glucagon and calcitonin.

=== Function ===
The presence of gastrin stimulates parietal cells of the stomach to secrete hydrochloric acid (HCl)/gastric acid. This is done both directly on the parietal cell and indirectly via binding onto CCK2/gastrin receptors on ECL cells in the stomach, which respond by releasing histamine, which in turn acts in a paracrine manner on parietal cells stimulating them to secrete H+ ions. This is the major stimulus for acid secretion by parietal cells.

Along with the above-mentioned function, gastrin has been shown to have additional functions as well:

* Stimulates parietal cell maturation and fundal growth.
* Causes chief cells to secrete pepsinogen, the zymogen (inactive) form of the digestive enzyme pepsin.
* Increases antral muscle mobility and promotes stomach contractions.
* Strengthens antral contractions against the pylorus, and relaxes the pyloric sphincter, which increases the rate of gastric emptying.
* Plays a role in the relaxation of the ileocecal valve.
* Induces pancreatic secretions and gallbladder emptying.
* May impact lower esophageal sphincter (LES) tone, causing it to contract, - although pentagastrin, rather than endogenous gastrin, may be the cause.
* Gastrin contributes to the gastrocolic reflex.

===Factors influencing secretion===
Factors influencing secretion of gastrin can be divided into 2 categories:

====Physiologic====
=====Gastric lumen=====
* Stimulatory factors: dietary protein and amino acids (meat), hypercalcemia. (i.e. during the gastric phase)
* Inhibitory factor: acidity (pH below 3) - a negative feedback mechanism, exerted via the release of somatostatin from δ cells in the stomach, which inhibits gastrin and histamine release.

=====Paracrine=====
* Stimulatory factor: bombesin or gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)
* Inhibitory factor: somatostatin - acts on somatostatin-2 receptors on G cells. in a paracrine manner via local diffusion in the intercellular spaces, but also systemically through its release into the local mucosal blood circulation; it inhibits acid secretion by acting on parietal cells.

=====Nervous=====
* Stimulatory factors: Beta-adrenergic agents, cholinergic agents, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)
* Inhibitory factor: Enterogastric reflex

=====Circulation=====
* Stimulatory factor: gastrin
* Inhibitory factors:gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), secretin, somatostatin, glucagon, calcitonin

====Pathophysiologic====
=====Paraneoplastic=====
* Gastrinoma paraneoplastic oversecretion (see &quot;Role in disease&quot;)

== Role in disease ==
In the Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, gastrin is produced at excessive levels, often by a gastrinoma gastrin-producing tumor, mostly benign of the duodenum or the pancreas. To investigate for hypergastrinemia high blood levels of gastrin, a &quot;pentagastrin test&quot; can be performed.

In autoimmune gastritis, the immune system attacks the parietal cells leading to hypochlorhydria low stomach acid secretion. This results in an elevated gastrin level in an attempt to compensate for increased pH in the stomach. Eventually, all the parietal cells are lost and achlorhydria results leading to a loss of negative feedback on gastrin secretion. Plasma gastrin concentration is elevated in virtually all individuals with mucolipidosis type IV (mean 1507 pg/mL; range 400-4100 pg/mL) (normal 0-200 pg/mL) secondary to a constitutive achlorhydria. This finding facilitates the diagnosis of patients with this neurogenetic disorder. Additionally, elevated gastrin levels may be present in chronic gastritis resulting from &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection.

==History==
Its existence was first suggested in 1905 by the British physiologist John Sydney Edkins, and gastrins were isolated in 1964 by Hilda Tracy and Roderic Alfred Gregory at the University of Liverpool. In 1964 the structure of gastrin was determined.

<doc id="609102" wikidata="Q2400296" url="?curid=609102" title="Auxiliary Units">
<text>The Auxiliary Units, Home Guard Shock Squads or GHQ Auxiliary Units were specially trained, highly secret quasi military units created by the British government during the Second World War with the aim of using irregular warfare in response to a possible invasion of the United Kingdom by Nazi Germany. With the advantage of having witnessed the rapid fall of several Continental European nations, the United Kingdom was the only country during the war that was able to create a guerrilla force in anticipation of an invasion.

Auxiliary Units relied on pre-prepared bunkers known as &quot;operational bases&quot;, into which they were to disappear in the event of invasion. They would not maintain contact with local Home Guard commanders, who were to be wholly unaware of their existence. Auxiliaries would not participate in the conventional phase of their town&#x27;s defence, but would be activated once the local Home Guard defence had been ended to inflict maximum mayhem and disruption over a further brief but violent period. They were not envisaged as a continuing resistance force against long-term occupation. The secrecy surrounding the insurgent squads meant that members &quot;had no military status, no uniforms and there are very few official records of their activities&quot;.

Service in the Auxiliary Units was expected to be highly dangerous, with a projected life expectancy of just twelve days for its members, with orders to either shoot one another or use explosives to kill themselves if capture by an enemy force seemed likely.

Urged on by the War Office, Prime Minister Winston Churchill initiated the Auxiliary Units in the early summer of 1940. This was to counter the civilian Home Defence Scheme already established by SIS (MI6), but outside War Office control. The Auxiliary Units answered to GHQ Home Forces but were legally an integral part of the Home Guard.

In modern times, the Auxiliary Units have sometimes misleadingly been referred to as the &quot;British Resistance Organisation&quot;. That title was never used by the organisation officially but reflects a subsequent misunderstanding of what their role might have been. Colloquially, members of the Auxiliary Units were referred to as &quot;s&quot; and their activities as &quot;scallywagging&quot;.

==Beginnings==
Section D, a sabotage and resistance unit which was part of MI6, began recruiting personnel and accumulating arms and equipment in mid-June, 1940. This roused suspicion among the military authorities, and General Ironside, the C-in-C of GHQ Home Forces, insisted that all guerrilla and sabotage organisations be subject to military control. Colonel Colin Gubbins was the obvious choice to command the new organisation. Gubbins was a regular British Army soldier who had acquired considerable experience and expertise in guerrilla warfare during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1919 and in the Irish War of Independence of 1919–1921. From early 1939, he had served with MI R, another guerrilla organisation controlled by the War Office. Most recently, he had returned from the Norwegian campaign, where he headed the Independent Companies, the predecessors of the British Commandos, before succeeding to the acting command of a Guards brigade. He later wrote:

I had, in fact, been given a blank cheque, but was there any money in the bank to meet it? Everything would have to be improvised. Time was of the essence ... at the shortest we had six weeks before a full-scale invasion could be launched; if we were lucky, we might have until October, after which climatic conditions would give us a respite ...

Gubbins used several officers who had served with the Independent Companies in Norway and others whom he had known there. Units were localised on a county structure, as they would probably be fragmented and isolated from one another. They were distributed around the coast rather than being countrywide, with priority being given to the counties most at risk from enemy invasion, the two most vulnerable being Kent and Sussex in South East England. The two best known officers from the period are Captain Peter Fleming of the Grenadier Guards and Captain Mike Calvert of the Royal Engineers.

==Operational Patrols==

Operational Patrols consisted of between four and eight men, often farmers or landowners. They were usually recruited from the most able members of the Home Guard, possessed excellent local knowledge and were able to live off the land. Gamekeepers and even poachers were particularly valued. They were always intended to fight in Home Guard uniform and from 1942 the men were badged to Home Guard battalions 201 (Scotland), 202 (northern England), or 203 (southern England).

Around 3,500 men were trained on weekend courses at Coleshill House, near Highworth, Wiltshire, in the arts of guerrilla warfare including assassination, unarmed combat, demolition and sabotage.

Each Patrol was a self-contained cell, expected to be self-sufficient and operationally autonomous in the case of invasion, generally operating within a 15-mile radius. They were provided with elaborately-concealed underground Operational Bases (AUOB / OB), usually built by the Royal Engineers in a local woodland, with a camouflaged entrance and emergency escape tunnel. It is thought that 400 to 500 such OBs were constructed in England, Wales and Scotland.

Some Patrols had an additional concealed Observation Post and/or underground ammunition store. Patrols were provided with a selection of the latest weapons, including a silenced pistol or Sten gun and Fairbairn–Sykes &quot;commando&quot; knives, quantities of plastic explosive, incendiary devices, and food to last for two weeks. Members anticipated being shot if they were captured, and were expected to shoot themselves first rather than be taken alive.

The mission of the units was to attack invading forces from behind their own lines while conventional forces fell back to prepared defences. Aircraft, fuel dumps, railway lines, and depots were high on the list of targets, as would be the assassination of senior German officers and any local collaborators. Patrols secretly reconnoitred local country houses, which might be used by German officers, and prepared lists of suspected fifth columnists as early targets for killing.

Although the Auxiliary Units would fight in Home Guard uniform, they would otherwise clearly be irregular combatants under the Geneva Conventions. They and their weapons would be concealed, they would not be under the control of the local Home Guard commander, and they would not be constrained by the &#x27;rules of war&#x27; in combat. General Home Guard units were instructed to fight on and not to surrender, but it was expected that nevertheless, once their ammunition was exhausted, they would have to give themselves up to capture. That was seen as creating an opportunity for a hidden Auxiliary Unit in the locality to kill as many Germans as possible just when they might be considering themselves as victors.

==Special Duty Sections and Signals==
Separate from the Auxiliary Units&#x27; Operational Patrols was the Special Duty Branch, which was originally recruited by SIS and carefully vetted and selected from the local civilian population. It acted as &quot;eyes and ears&quot; and would report back to military intelligence any information that it heard from &#x27;careless talk&#x27; or from watching troop movements and supply routes. It was supported by a signals network of hidden, short-range, wireless sets around the coast. The structure allowed no means to pass on such information to the Operational Patrols.

It is unlikely that the wireless network would survive long after invasion and that it would not have been possible to link the isolated Operational Patrols into a national network that could act in concert on behalf of a British government in exile and its representatives still in the United Kingdom. Instead, SIS (MI6) created a separate resistance organisation (Section VII) with powerful wireless sets that was intended to act on a longer-term basis.

The Special Duties Sections were recruited largely from the civilian population, with around 4,000 members. They had been trained to identify vehicles, high-ranking officers and military units and were to gather intelligence and leave reports in dead letter drops. The reports would be collected by runners and taken to one of over 200 secret radio transmitters operated by trained civilian signals staff. The civilian personnel operated as &#x27;Intelligence Gatherers&#x27; and operated the OUT Station radios. ATS subalterns or Royal Signals personnel operated the Special Duties IN-Stations and Zero Stations.

==Later history==
In November 1940, Gubbins moved to the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which had incorporated Section D and MI R, as its Director of Operations.

The Auxiliary Units were kept in being long after any immediate German threat had passed and were stood down only in November 1944. Several Auxiliary Unit members later joined the Special Air Service. Many men saw action in the campaign in France in late 1944, notably in Operation Houndsworth and Operation Bulbasket.

From 1942, the Operational Patrols of the Auxiliary Units tried to reinvent themselves as an anti-raiding force. That was primarily a device to avoid them from being disbanded, as the War Office had made a promise that the volunteers would not be returned to normal Home Guard duties. They therefore had to be kept in existence until the general stand-down of the Home Guard. Nonetheless, some units were deployed to the Isle of Wight prior to the D day landings in 1944 to help protect the Pluto fuel pipeline from being attacked by German commandos. It was then suggested that the Auxiliary Units should be fully administered by the Home Guard, but that was not enacted before the final stand-down in November 1944.

==Cultural references==
An Auxiliary Unit arms cache features in the 1985 BBC TV series, &quot;Blott on the Landscape&quot;.

British partisans feature in two UK films that imagine what would have happened if Germany had successfully invaded Britain: the 1966 film &quot;It Happened Here&quot; (which simply refers to &#x27;partisans&#x27;) and the 2011 film &quot;Resistance&quot; based on Owen Sheers&#x27; first novel, &quot;Resistance&quot;. The partisans in the latter are loosely based upon Auxiliary Units, albeit with considerable artistic licence.

The Auxiliary Units feature in the BBC TV series &quot;Wartime Farm&quot; although there is some confusion between the roles of the Operational Patrols and the Special Duties Branch.

The Auxiliary Units and Special Duties Branch feature heavily in Gordon Stevens&#x27; 1991 novel &quot;And All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (). The novel examines an alternate history following a successful German invasion of England.

<text>The Fann Mountains () are part of the western Pamir-Alay mountain system in Tajikistan&#x27;s Sughd Province, between the Zarafshan Range to the north and the Gissar Range to the south. In an east-west direction, they extend from the Fan Darya to the Archimaydan River.

==Peaks, lakes and access==
The Fanns boast about a hundred peaks, with several rising to altitudes of more than 5,000 meters and relative elevations of up to 1,500 meters. The highest point in Fann Mountains is Chimtarga peak (5,489 m). Other 5,000-meter peaks are Bodkhona (5,138 m), Chapdara (5,050 m), Big Hansa, Little Hansa (5,031 m), Zamok (&#x27;5,070 m), Mirali (5,132 m), and Energia (5,120 m).

There are many lakes in the Fanns.The best known are Alaudin lakes in the Chapdara River valley, Kulikalon Lakes on the northern slope of Chimtarga peak, Big Allo Lake and Iskanderkul Lake.

There is a stunning mountain range in Western Tajikistan, near the city of Punjikent, which surprises tourists with its vivid, ever-changing colours. This are known as the Seven Lakes, Haftkul, or even Marguzor Lakes. In Tadjiki it means seven lakes (named after the largest lake in the group).

The best time for visiting is late June–mid-September for trekking and July–August for mountaineering, when the weather is usually at its best. Access is generally from Panjakent, which can be reached either from Dushanbe or Samarkand.

<doc id="609107" wikidata="Q7601048" url="?curid=609107" title="Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual">
<text>The Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual (, Ballantine Books 1975, reprinted 1986, 1996, 2006) is a fiction reference book by Franz Joseph Schnaubelt, about the workings of Starfleet, a military, exploratory, and diplomatic organization featured in the television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Although it is fiction, the book is presented as an in-universe collection of factual documents, describing the 23rd century Starfleet and United Federation of Planets, and it is described as having been accidentally sent from the future to the 20th century—specifically, when as described in &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot;, the starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; was accidentally propelled back in time in a freak mishap, causing the manual&#x27;s contents to be accidentally downloaded into the main computers of the now-closed Omaha Air Force Station.

==Contents==
The book provides some detail on the workings of technology used in the original series, including its ships, phasers, tricorders, universal translators, and medical equipment, and even diagrams for a working communicator built using 20th century electronics. It also contains plans for 3-dimensional chess, and lays out some basic game rules.

==History==
In 1973, Joseph and his daughter joined a San Diego &quot;Trek&quot; appreciation society called STAR, the members of which spent time making their own Trek props and costumes. Using his aerospace design talents, he began making technical drawings of phasers and tricorders. He quickly amassed a large collection and sent copies to a very impressed Gene Roddenberry, whose wife Majel Barrett&#x27;s company, Lincoln Enterprises, was producing &quot;Trek&quot; memorabilia at the time. Though he considered the franchise dead, Roddenberry encouraged Joseph to seek Barrett&#x27;s help in creating a manual, a project blessed with privileged access to original props and carpenter&#x27;s blueprints.

The book was published by Ballantine Books, a division of Random House, November 1975. The format was a paperback book, contained within a removable rigid black plastic binder, much like a typical real world technical manual. The binder featured a clear front pocket, within which the &quot;dust jacket&quot; of the book was placed. It could be removed, with the plastic binder reading only &quot;STAR FLEET TECHNICAL MANUAL&quot;, just as a real manual might appear. It took the number one spot on &quot;The New York Times&quot; trade paperback list, breaking the existing record for profitability. Its success hinted at the brand&#x27;s great potential, and within a year of its publication, Paramount and Roddenberry contracted to begin work on a &quot;Star Trek&quot; movie.

==Use as reference material==
The book was culled for background imagery in the first three &quot;Trek&quot; films. Elements from the manual that appear on screen include:
* Listings of starship names, adapted for opening-scene backgrounds at the communications outpost in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;; 
* Starship class schematics, seen in background bridge displays in the Kobayashi Maru test in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;; and
* USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; plans, used in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; in a monitor display when the seal on Spock&#x27;s living quarters is broken.

In addition, the manual, along with semi-official blueprints available at the time of the Klingon and Romulan ships, was a major source for the initial designs used for Federation ships for the board game &quot;Star Fleet Battles&quot;.

A Kelvin &quot;Timeline of Star Trek&quot; version of the Saladin Class Destroyer from the manual appears in the mobile and PC game &quot;Star Trek Fleet Command&quot;.</text><links>

<doc id="609110" wikidata="Q5644268" url="?curid=609110" title="Hamburg, South Carolina">
<text>Hamburg is a ghost town in Aiken County, South Carolina, United States. It was once a thriving upriver market located across the Savannah River from Augusta, Georgia in the Edgefield District. It was founded by Henry Shultz in 1821 who named it after his home town in Germany of the same name. The town was one of the state&#x27;s primary interior markets by the 1830s, due largely to the fact that the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company chose Hamburg as the western terminus of its line to Charleston.

The enervation of the town, which relied on its in-land port being the destination of cotton headed toward the ports of Charleston or Savannah for business, began in 1848 after Augusta siphoned much of the town&#x27;s river traffic with the completion of the Augusta Canal. The town&#x27;s decline was finalized in the 1850s when the South Carolina Canal and Rail Road Company extended its line into Augusta.

After the American Civil War, Hamburg was repopulated mostly by freedmen and was within newly organized Aiken County. The town became notorious in 1876 as the site of a massacre of blacks by whites in what was one of a number of violent incidents by Democratic paramilitary groups to suppress black voting in that year&#x27;s elections. The Democrats regained control of the state government and federal troops were withdrawn the next year from South Carolina and other states, ending the Reconstruction era.

==History==
=== Early years ===
The founder of Hamburg, Henry Shultz, was a parvenu until his origin was discovered in 2016 by Jürgen Möller. Born in Germany in 1776 as Klaus Hinrich Klahn, Shultz arrived in Augusta in 1806 as a simple day worker. But, by 1813, the business dealings of Shultz had elevated him to a position capable of building a long-lasting bridge across the Savannah River, a feat which one of the wealthiest South Carolinian of the 1790s, Wade Hampton I, had failed to accomplish on two previous occasions.

Shultz would go on to become a leading citizen in the city of Augusta, owning part of the Steamboat Company of Georgia as well as a wharf in Augusta. But, like many bank owners (Shultz used his bridge to back a bank which he called the Bridge Bank) in the 1810s, Shultz issued paper currency which led to his bankruptcy during the Panic of 1819. After being sued by his creditors, the Georgia state officials seized the Augusta Bridge from Shultz.

Shultz felt slighted by the city of Augusta and purchased a swath of land opposite the Savannah River which had previously been owned by Chickasaw indians in order to compete with the city. The following year, Shultz sought and procured loans from the South Carolina General Assembly to improve inland navigation between the town and Charleston. On top of this, the General Assembly exempted all taxable property within the town from taxation for five years.

Shultz established a second bank, the Bank of Hamburg, in 1823, backed by his Hamburg property which &quot;faded into oblivion&quot; within two years. Ten years later, a decade bank was founded with support from the General Assembly. This second iteration became one of the best-known banks in the country, reliable enough to be used by many families to pay colleges in the North. The establishment of the second bank coincided with the decline of the South Carolina wagon trade. From 1819 to 1823, the trade shrunk to one-fourth its former size as steamboats became the cheaper form of transportation for upcountry harvests. The emergence of steamboats led Hamburg and other towns strategically located at the fall lines of major rivers such as Camden and Columbia to become economically important for the first time.

During his American tour as &#x27;Guest of the Nation&#x27;, the Marquis de Lafayette visited Hamburg on March 24, 1825. In a book recounting their trip, Lafayette&#x27;s secretary wrote that Lafayette was invited to visit &quot;a sort of prodigy&quot;, a &quot;village called Hamburg&quot;, which was &quot;not yet two years old and its port was already filled with vessels.&quot;

===Slave market===

Slave trading was banned in Georgia so planters crossed the Savannah River to purchase in Hamburg until the repeal of the anti-trading law in 1856.

=== Competition with Augusta ===
At the completion of the South Carolina Railroad in 1833 (at the time the largest railroad under single management in the world) Hamburg became the railroad&#x27;s western terminus.

In its heyday, 60,000 bales of cotton worth $2,000,000 were brought by wagon to Hamburg each year. With the completion of the Augusta Canal (1848) and general expansion of railroads in the 1850s, strenuous overland hauls to Hamburg became unnecessary and the famous wagon traffic declined. Hamburg became a ghost town by the time of the Civil War.

=== After the Civil War ===
Following the war, Hamburg was repopulated and governed by freedmen, starting with Prince Rivers; Samuel J. Lee, a free man before the war, who was elected as the speaker of the House and was the first black man admitted to the South Carolina Bar; and Charles D. Hayne, a freeman from an elite Charleston family. These three men were founders of Aiken County. They began to redevelop Hamburg, attracting freedmen. To celebrate Aiken County&#x27;s 125th anniversary, a stone-and-bronze marker was installed at the county courthouse. Rivers, Hayne and Leeld are listed as founders but their race is not indicated.

After the deaths and damage in the Hamburg Massacre of July 8, 1876, the town declined for good. Augusta began construction of a river levee after a 1911 flood, but Hamburg remained unprotected. Particularly disastrous floods finally forced out the last residents in 1929.

==Geography==
Occasionally styled as &quot;Hamburgh&quot; (especially after the American Civil War), the town was named after Shultz&#x27;s home town in Germany. It was located at 33.4799°N, 81.9579°W directly across the Savannah River from Augusta, Georgia. Population at its peak in the 1840s reached 2,500 (Haskel 1843:257), and exceeded 1,000 in the 1870s. For the most part the town was on the Savannah River floodplain. The town was originally accessible by a stagecoach road starting at the Edgefield County Courthouse, and later by the Edgefield and Hamburg Plank Road. 

Under protection of the Clarks Hill Dam and Lake, adjacent North Augusta has begun to develop on the grounds of old Hamburg.

<doc id="609112" wikidata="Q1377658" url="?curid=609112" title="Jason Varitek">
<text>Jason Andrew Varitek (; born April 11, 1972), nicknamed &quot;Tek&quot;, is an American professional baseball coach and former catcher. He is the game planning coordinator, a uniformed coaching position, for the Boston Red Sox. After being traded as a minor league prospect by the Seattle Mariners, Varitek played his entire 15-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Red Sox. A three-time All-Star and Gold Glove Award winner at catcher, as well as a Silver Slugger Award winner, Varitek was part of both the 2004 World Series and 2007 World Series Championship teams, and was viewed widely as one of the team&#x27;s leaders. In December 2004 he was named the captain of the Red Sox, only their fourth captain since 1923. He was a switch-hitter.

Varitek is one of only three players, along with pitcher Ed Vosberg and outfielder Michael Conforto, to have played in the Little League World Series, College World Series, and Major League World Series. He additionally participated in Olympic Baseball and the World Baseball Classic. His Lake Brantley High School baseball team won the Florida State Championship his senior year in 1990 and was named the number one high school baseball team in the nation by a &quot;USA Today&quot; poll. Varitek caught an MLB-record four no-hitters, a record which was later tied by Carlos Ruiz.

==Little League career==
Varitek played in the 1984 Little League World Series, leading his Altamonte Springs, Florida, team to victory in the United States Championship bracket in a 4–2 victory over Southport, Indiana.

==High school and college==
Varitek was Lake Brantley High School&#x27;s third baseman and relief catcher. Brantley&#x27;s first line catcher was Jerry Thurston, himself a pro prospect. In 1990, the Patriots won the state championship.

Varitek attended Georgia Tech, where he helped lead the Yellow Jackets baseball team to the 1994 College World Series title game, along with future Red Sox teammates Nomar Garciaparra and Jay Payton (they lost to the University of Oklahoma). In 1994, he received the &quot;Baseball America&quot; College Player of the Year Award, and won the Dick Howser Trophy for National Collegiate Player of the Year. Varitek graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in management and is the only Tech baseball player to have his number (33) retired.

In 1991 and 1993, Varitek played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Hyannis Mets. In 1993, he hit .371 for Hyannis, won the league batting title, and was named the league&#x27;s MVP. In 2002, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame. Varitek was a member of the U.S. national baseball team at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Early professional career==
Varitek was drafted 21st overall in the first round by the Minnesota Twins in 1993, but opted to return for his senior year of college. Following graduation, Varitek signed with agent Scott Boras and was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the first round of the amateur draft, with the 14th pick overall. A pioneer of the loopholes in the draft process, Varitek signed with the St. Paul Saints in the independent Northern League before agreeing to terms with the Mariners, and consequently did not enter the Mariners&#x27; minor league system until . When he finally did join the franchise, Varitek was sent to the AA affiliate Port City Roosters where he first met pitcher and longtime teammate Derek Lowe. He was traded with Lowe to the Red Sox during the season in return for reliever Heathcliff Slocumb, often cited as one of the best trades in the Red Sox&#x27;s favor in recent history.

==Major league career==

===1997–2004===

Varitek was called up for a single game on September 24, 1997, collecting a single in his only at bat. During the 1998 season, Varitek split time with incumbent catcher Scott Hatteberg, playing in 86 games. Varitek showed signs of things to come in the season, and with a strong spring training the following season, Varitek earned the starting catcher position.

The year was a breakout season for the catcher. Varitek played in 144 games, hitting for a .269 average, with 20 home runs and 76 RBIs. Varitek went 5–21 with 3 RBI in the 1999 ALDS against the Cleveland Indians and 4–20 with 1 RBI in the ALCS against the New York Yankees. During the ALDS, he set a postseason record by scoring five runs in a single game.

Looking forward to building more success from the year before, the 2000 season was a disappointment offensively, producing a .248 average with only 10 home runs and 65 RBI, as the Red Sox failed to qualify for post-season play. Prior to the season, Varitek signed a three-year, $14.9 million contract with Boston. Varitek went on a hitting hot streak, having a .310 average at one point and on May 20, 2001, he homered three times in a single game before a broken left elbow injury sidelined the catcher for nearly the rest of the season, as Varitek dove to catch a foul ball on June 7. The play went on to be a top Web Gem for the month of July 2001. Varitek finished the season with a .293 average, seven home runs, and 25 RBI in 51 games played.

Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup full-time in the season. The return did not go smoothly, however, as Varitek struggled to find himself at the plate. Despite not reaching his full offensive potential, pitchers and coaches alike began to notice how much Varitek&#x27;s preparation and knowledge of the game was helping the pitchers. His study habits and extra hours of work with pitchers would soon become his defining attribute. Varitek and the Red Sox entered the season with a renewed fire to reach the playoffs after missing in the previous three years. Varitek instantly became a leader in the clubhouse which management tried to portray as working class, featuring new faces such as Kevin Millar, David Ortiz, Bill Mueller, and Todd Walker along with original players Trot Nixon and Lou Merloni. The 2003 season was Varitek&#x27;s best to date and he earned his first All-Star selection after the fans voted him in with the All-Star Final Vote. He was hitting .296 with 15 home runs and 51 RBI going into the All-Star break and finished the season off with a solid .273 average, 25 home runs and 85 RBI, all career highs. The Red Sox earned a Wild Card berth and their first playoff appearance since 1999, before losing the 2003 ALCS to the Yankees.

In , Varitek compiled a career-high .296 batting average with 18 home runs and 73 RBI. During a nationally televised game on July 24, Varitek shoved his glove into the face of the Yankees&#x27; Alex Rodriguez after Rodriguez was hit by a pitch and gestured towards pitcher Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodriguez) from the game following the incident, the Red Sox, spurred on by the fight, came from behind to win 11–10. It is also sometimes regarded as the turning point in the Red Sox&#x27; season, as they posted MLB&#x27;s best record after the melee. Boston culminated the season with its first World Series championship in 86 years, after being the first MLB team to overcome a three games to none deficit, doing so in the ALCS against the Yankees. Varitek went 3-for-4 in the crucial Game 6 (the &quot;Bloody Sock game&quot; of the ALCS which Boston won 4-2).

At the end of the year, Varitek became a free agent and signed a four-year, $40-million contract with the Red Sox.

===2005–2011===

After Varitek&#x27;s re-signing the Red Sox appointed him team captain, only the fourth Red Sox player so honored since 1923, following Hall of Famers Jimmie Foxx (–), Carl Yastrzemski ( and –) and Jim Rice (–). At the time, Varitek was one of just three captains in MLB (the others were Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees and Paul Konerko of the Chicago White Sox). Varitek remained captain until his retirement before the 2012 season. Varitek wore a &quot;C&quot; patch on his uniform, making him the first player to do so in a World Series.

In , Varitek won his first Gold Glove Award, his first Silver Slugger, and his second All-Star selection.

In , Varitek represented the United States in the World Baseball Classic, playing in three games. He made the most of his playing time, hitting a grand slam against Team Canada allowing Team USA to narrow an 8–2 lead down to 8–6. Team Canada, however, kept the lead in the upset victory.

On July 18, 2006, Varitek played his 991st game at catcher for the Boston Red Sox, breaking Carlton Fisk&#x27;s club record. That game was a home game vs. Kansas City, during which Varitek&#x27;s achievement was recognized before the bottom of the fifth inning (after the game was official and couldn&#x27;t be cancelled due to weather). Varitek received a standing ovation from the sellout crowd at Fenway Park for a few moments before play resumed. On July 31, 2006, Varitek was injured rounding the bases in a 9–8 victory over the Cleveland Indians (his 1,000th career game as catcher), but said he believed the initial injury to the knee occurred while he was blocking home plate to make the tag against the Angels Mike Napoli on July 29, 2006. He had surgery on August 3, 2006, to repair torn cartilage in his left knee. Varitek returned to the Red Sox lineup on September 4, following a short rehabilitation assignment in Pawtucket.

On September 19, 2006, Varitek was honored during a pre-game ceremony as the first Red Sox catcher to catch 1,000 games. He was presented with a special award by Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk, who held the Boston club record with 990 career games caught before Varitek surpassed it. Varitek caught his 1,000th game on July 31 and by the evening of the ceremony had appeared in 1,009 games behind the plate. That same night, Varitek also received the 2006 Red Sox Heart and Hustle Award from the local chapter of the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, which is presented to a player exemplifying the values, tradition, and spirit of the game of baseball.

In 2007, Varitek and the Red Sox returned to the World Series, winning for the second time in four years. During the season, Varitek recorded his 1,000th career hit. On May 19, 2008, he caught Jon Lester&#x27;s no-hitter, giving him a Major League record of having caught four separate no-hitters in his career.

In honor of being captain, Varitek released Captain Cabernet, a charity wine with proceeds benefiting Pitching In For Kids and Children&#x27;s Hospital Boston.

At the end of the 2008 season, Varitek opted for free agency.
Reports in the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; suggested that his agent, Scott Boras, was using New York Yankee catcher Jorge Posada&#x27;s four-year, $52.4 million deal as a benchmark for negotiations. On February 6, 2009, Varitek signed a new one-year deal with the Red Sox worth $5 million with a $5 million club option, or a $3 million player option, for 2010.
During the 2009 season, Varitek&#x27;s numbers were similar to his dismal 2008 season, with slightly more home runs (14), doubles (24) and runs batted in (51), and a higher slugging percentage (.390) despite a lower batting average (.209) and fewer at bats (425). He eventually became the backup catcher when the Red Sox acquired All-Star Victor Martinez on the July 31 trade deadline.

On December 2, 2010, Sports Illustrated reported that Varitek signed a one-year, $2 million deal to stay with the Red Sox for the 2011 season. The deal was finalized on December 10. With the addition of Jarrod Saltalamacchia, Varitek usually came off the bench during the 2011 season, playing in 68 games, hitting .221 with 11 home runs, 36 RBI, with a .300 on-base percentage.

After the 2011 season, Varitek became a free agent once again, and was offered a minor league contract, with an invitation to spring training, by the Red Sox. On March 1, 2012, at Jet Blue Park in Fort Myers, Florida, Varitek officially announced his retirement.

Ryan Lavarnway, fellow catcher and teammate of Varitek in 2011, listed the Boston veteran as his favorite player growing up. &quot;Varitek has set the gold standard for the position, catching four no-hitters and winning two World Series. He’s a true professional in handling a pitching staff and is something I’d like to become as my career progresses.&quot;

==Post-playing career==
On September 27, 2012, then-Red Sox general manager Ben Cherington announced that Varitek had been named special assistant to the general manager. In that role, Cherington said Varitek would be involved in areas such as &quot;major league personnel decisions, evaluations, and mentorship and instruction of young players.&quot; His role by March 2018 was &quot;Special Assistant to the President of Baseball Operations&quot;. After not appearing in the team&#x27;s front-office directory during the 2019 season, in 2020 he was listed as &quot;Special Assistant / Catching Coach&quot;. On November 20, 2020, Varitek was named to a uniformed coaching role, that of game planning coordinator, on the coaching staff of manager Alex Cora. His title was changed to Player Information Coach prior to the start of the 2021 season. On November 2, 2022, Varitek signed a three–year contract extension to remain on Boston&#x27;s coaching staff.

<text>Jan Willem Lincoln van de Wetering (February 12, 1931 – July 4, 2008) was the author of a number of works in English and Dutch.

==Biography==

Van de Wetering was born and raised in Rotterdam, but in later years he lived in South Africa, Japan, London, Colombia, Peru, Australia, Amsterdam and most recently in Surry, Maine, the setting of two of his Grijpstra and de Gier novels and his children&#x27;s series about the porcupine &quot;Hugh Pine&quot;.

Van de Wetering studied Zen under the guidance of Oda Sessō, together with Walter Nowick, at Daitoku-ji in Kyoto. Van de Wetering lived a year in Daitoku-ji and half a year with Nowick outside the temple, and described his experiences in his book &quot;The Empty Mirror&quot;. The book includes an account of a visit to the monastery by Hugo Enomiya-Lassalle, describing his own mixed thoughts about this representative of what he deemed an old-fashioned religion. Sōkō Morinaga, Walter Nowick&#x27;s Dharma brother, wrote in &quot;Novice to Master&quot; about traditional practices at that time.

Van de Wettering also encountered American poet and author Gary Snyder (referred to in &quot;The Empty Mirror&quot; as &quot;Gerald&quot;) during his time at Daitoku-ji. Snyder was also studying under abbot Oda Sesso Roshi at that time. 

His many travels, and his experiences in a Zen Buddhist monastery and as a member of the Amsterdam Reserve Constabulary (&quot;being a policeman in one&#x27;s spare time&quot; as he phrased it in his introduction to &quot;Outsider in Amsterdam&quot;) lend some authenticity to his works of fiction and non-fiction.

Van de Wetering was awarded the French Grand Prix de Littérature Policière in 1984 for his novel &quot;Maine Massacre&quot;. He died in Blue Hill, Maine, aged 77.

== Bibliography ==
Van de Wetering was particularly noted for his detective fiction, his most popular creations being Grijpstra and de Gier, a pair of Amsterdam police officers who figure in a lengthy series of novels and short stories. Most of the mysteries are rich with images from Amsterdam, where most of them take place; some also feature a cat: in earlier novels, one named Oliver; in later novels, a female named Tabriz. He also wrote stories for children and nonfiction works. He usually wrote in Dutch and then in English; the two versions often differ considerably.

===Grijpstra and de Gier novels===
Adjutant-Detective Henk Grijpstra and Detective-Sergeant Rinus de Gier, along with their never-named elderly superior, the Commissaris, are the most popular creations of Janwillem van de Wetering. They are police detectives in the Murder Brigade of the Amsterdam Municipal Police, and are featured in fourteen detective novels and several short stories published in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;.

Grijpstra, heavy, middle-aged, and less than happily married, is the senior partner of the duo. Though he was raised in Amsterdam, he is a Frisian (from Friesland, a northern area of the Netherlands) born in the port city of Harlingen. In his youth he dreamed of becoming a jazz musician or a painter. When a set of drums mysteriously appeared in police headquarters he appropriated them.

De Gier, a younger man with deep brown eyes and curly hair, and most-often sporting a tasteful denim suit, is single, handsome, and very successful with women. He is an avowed bachelor and dedicated to his cats. He is a dreamer and a deep thinker, often pondering aloud on &quot;the void,&quot; Zen, and life. A native of Rotterdam, de Gier is, like Grijpstra, an amateur musician. He often carries a small flute, and in odd moments he and Grijpstra improvise together in their office, where Grijpstra has his set of drums.

The Commissaris, small, elderly, and often nearly incapacitated by chronic rheumatism, supervises the partners&#x27; field investigations. Intelligent and broadly experienced, he often provides key insights into his juniors&#x27; cases, as well as philosophical commentary. A Frisian like Grijpstra, the Commissaris is fond of jenever and small cigars. Only his first name, Jan, is ever mentioned.

Grijpstra, de Gier, and the Commissaris first appeared in the novel &quot;Outsider in Amsterdam&quot;. The novels (in both publishing order and internal chronological order) are:

#&quot;Outsider in Amsterdam&quot; (1975)
#&quot;Tumbleweed&quot; (1976)
#&quot;The Corpse on the Dike&quot; (1976)
#&quot;Death of a Hawker&quot; (1977)

#&quot;Just a Corpse at Twilight&quot; (1994) 
#&quot;The Hollow-Eyed Angel&quot; (1996)

A complete anthology of short stories, &quot;The Amsterdam Cops: Collected Stories&quot;, was published in 1999, replacing two earlier anthologies, &quot;The Sergeant&#x27;s Cat and Other Stories&quot; and &quot;The Amsterdam Cops and Other Stories&quot;.
