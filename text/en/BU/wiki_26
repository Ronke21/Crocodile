<text>The Association is an American sunshine pop band from Los Angeles, California. During the late 1960s, the band had numerous hits at or near the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts (including &quot;Windy&quot;, &quot;Cherish&quot;, &quot;Never My Love&quot; and &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot;) and were the lead-off band at 1967&#x27;s Monterey Pop Festival. Generally consisting of six to eight members, they are known for intricate vocal harmonies by the band&#x27;s multiple singers.

Their best-known lineup included Terry Kirkman (vocals, woodwind instruments, percussion), Russ Giguere (vocals, guitar), Jim Yester (vocals, rhythm and lead guitar), Jules Alexander (vocals, lead and rhythm guitar, bass), Brian Cole (vocals, bass) and Ted Bluechel Jr. (vocals, drums, percussion). This lineup recorded their first two albums, &quot;And Then... Along Comes the Association&quot; and &quot;Renaissance&quot; (both 1966) before Larry Ramos replaced Alexander in early 1967. With Ramos, the group recorded their third and fourth albums, &quot;Insight Out&quot; and &quot;Birthday&quot;. Alexander re-joined in late 1968, and the group released their fifth album &quot;The Association&quot; in 1969. Keyboardist Richard Thompson replaced Giguere in 1970, with whom the band recorded their final two albums &quot;Stop Your Motor&quot; (1971) and &quot;Waterbeds in Trinidad!&quot; (1972). The group has since been through several lineup changes. The current lineup includes Alexander, Yester and longtime members Jordan Cole, Del Ramos, Bruce Pictor and Paul Holland.

== History ==
===Beginnings===
Jules Alexander was in Hawaii in 1962 serving a stint in the Navy when he met Terry Kirkman, a visiting salesman. The two young musicians jammed together and promised to get together once Alexander was discharged. That happened a year later; the two eventually moved to Los Angeles and began exploring the city&#x27;s music scene in the mid-1960s, often working behind the scenes as directors and arrangers for other music acts. At the same time, Kirkman played in groups with Frank Zappa for a short period before Zappa went on to form the Mothers of Invention.

Eventually, at a Monday night hootenanny at the Los Angeles nightclub The Troubadour in 1964, an ad hoc group called the Inner Tubes was formed by Kirkman, Alexander and Doug Dillard, whose rotating membership contained, at one time or another, Cass Elliot, David Crosby and many others who drifted in and out. This led, in the fall of 1964, to the forming of the Men, a 13-piece folk rock band. This group had a brief spell as the house band at The Troubadour.

After a short time, however, the Men disbanded, with six of the members electing to go out on their own in February 1965. At the suggestion of Kirkman&#x27;s then-fiancée, Judy, they took the name the Association. The original lineup consisted of Alexander (using his middle name, Gary, on the first two albums) on vocals and lead guitar; Kirkman on vocals and a variety of wind, brass and percussion instruments; Brian Cole on vocals, bass and woodwinds; Russ Giguere on vocals, percussion and guitar; Ted Bluechel Jr. from the Cherry Hill Singers on drums, guitar, bass and vocals; and Brian Cole&#x27;s friend and bandmate from the group Gnu Fokes, Bob Page on guitar, banjo and vocals. However, Page was replaced by Jim Yester on vocals, guitar and keyboards before any of the group&#x27;s public performances.

The new band spent about five months rehearsing before they began performing around the Los Angeles area, most notably a regular stint at The Ice House in Pasadena (where Giguere had worked as lighting director) and its sister club in Glendale. Eventually, the small Jubilee label issued a single of &quot;Babe I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot;, a song originally recorded by Joan Baez and later popularized by Led Zeppelin, but nothing happened. Finally, Valiant Records offered them a contract, with the first result being a version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;, which was produced by Valiant&#x27;s owner, Barry De Vorzon, at Gold Star Studios.

The Men were first managed by Doug Weston, owner of the Troubador, before switching to actor Dean Fredericks, who remained on board when the Association was formed and helped get them the Valiant deal. In 1966 Fredericks turned the reins over to Pat Colecchio, who managed the group for the next eight years, then on and off during the two years after that. Fredericks later sued the band for breach of contract and was awarded a settlement.

===First success===
Their national break came with the song &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot;, written by Tandyn Almer. Alexander first heard the song when he was hired to play on a demo version and persuaded Almer to give the Association first dibs on it, with Jim Yester on lead vocals. The song was controversial with some media observers noting that &quot;Mary&quot; was street slang for marijuana, but it went to No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and led to the group&#x27;s first album, &quot;And Then... Along Comes the Association&quot; (July 1966), produced by Curt Boettcher and begun in Gary S. Paxton&#x27;s garage, with vocals done separately at Columbia. Another song from the album, &quot;Cherish&quot;, written by Kirkman, became the Association&#x27;s first No. 1 hit in September 1966 and one of a handful of the Sixties&#x27; most popular &quot;slow dance&quot; ballads.

The group followed with their second album, &quot;Renaissance&quot;, released in November 1966. The band changed producers, dropping Boettcher in favor of Jerry Yester (brother of Jim and formerly of the Modern Folk Quartet and later, a member of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful). The album did not spawn any major hits (the highest-charting single, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Golden Heebie Jeebies&quot;, stalled at No. 35), and the album only reached No. 34, compared with the No. 5 showing for &quot;And Then... Along Comes the Association&quot;.

===Crest ===
In late 1966, Warner Bros. Records, which had been distributing Valiant, bought the smaller label and, with it, the Association&#x27;s contract.

In 1966, a collection of poems penned by the six members was released as &quot;Crank Your Spreaders&quot;; the book was reprinted in August 1969.

In April 1967, Alexander left the band to study meditation in India and was replaced by Larry Ramos (born Hilario Ramos) on vocals and guitar. Ramos joined the band while Alexander was still performing with them after bassist Cole&#x27;s hand was injured by a firecracker; Alexander subbed on bass while Ramos played lead guitar. Ramos had previously performed with the New Christy Minstrels and had even recorded solo singles for Columbia Records. He went on to sing co-lead (along with Giguere and Kirkman) on two of the Association&#x27;s biggest hit singles, &quot;Windy&quot; and &quot;Never My Love&quot;.

With the lineup settled, the group returned to the studio, this time with Bones Howe in the producer&#x27;s chair. The first fruits of this pairing were the single &quot;Windy&quot;, written by Ruthann Friedman, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on July 1, 1967, and staying there for four consecutive weeks, preceded by the album &quot;Insight Out&quot;, which reached No. 8 in June.

On June 16, 1967, the Association was the first act to perform at the Monterey Pop Festival. (The Criterion Collection DVD of the festival includes their performance of &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; on disc 3.)

The group&#x27;s success continued with its next single, &quot;Never My Love&quot;, written by Dick and Don Addrisi; it went to No. 2 in &quot;Billboard&quot; and No. 1 in &quot;Cash Box&quot; in October 1967. It became the group&#x27;s only double-sided charted record, as its B-side, &quot;Requiem for the Masses&quot;, made a brief showing on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. Like &quot;Cherish&quot; and &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;, &quot;Never My Love&quot;&#x27;s vocal arrangement was provided by Clark Burroughs, former member of the Hi-Lo&#x27;s. &quot;Never My Love&quot; has since been certified the second-most-frequently-played song in America during the 20th century (the group placed two other songs, &quot;Cherish&quot; and &quot;Windy&quot;, on BMI&#x27;s list of the 100 most played).

In 1968, after turning down a cantata composed by Jimmy Webb that included the now-classic &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, the group produced its fourth album, &quot;Birthday&quot; (March 1968), with Bones Howe again at the controls. This album spawned &quot;Everything That Touches You&quot;, the group&#x27;s last Hot 100 Top 10 hit, and &quot;Time for Livin&#x27;&quot;, the group&#x27;s final Hot 100 Top 40 hit.

Later that year, the group released a self-produced single, the harder-edged &quot;Six Man Band&quot;. This song also appeared on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, released in November 1968.

===Comings and goings===
At the close of 1968, Alexander, who had returned from India and had done a stint with another band called Joshua Fox, returned to the group, which now made the Association a seven-man band.

The larger band&#x27;s first project was to contribute to the soundtrack for &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; (1969), the film version of Philip Roth&#x27;s best-selling novel. The title track, written by Yester, peaked at No. 80. John Boylan, one third of the little-known group Hamilton Streetcar, worked with the group on the soundtrack and stayed on board for its next album, &quot;The Association&quot; (August 1969). Many of the tracks on this album have a country-rock sound but none of the singles released made any impact, so the group re-teamed with Curt Boettcher in late 1969 for a one-off single, &quot;Just About the Same&quot; (released in February 1970), a reworking of a song Boettcher had recorded with his group, the Millennium. This too failed to catch on.

Despite all this, the band remained a popular concert draw, and on April 3, 1970, a Salt Lake City performance was recorded for &quot;The Association Live&quot;.

In June 1970, Giguere left the band; he released a solo album, &quot;Hexagram 16&quot;, the following year. The Association replaced him with keyboardist Richard Thompson (not to be confused with the English singer-songwriter/guitarist), who had contributed to previous albums and began playing live with the group for some July 4 &amp; 5 appearances in Atlantic City. Thompson had previously been known primarily in jazz circles.

The album &quot;Stop Your Motor&quot; was released in July 1971. It was the group&#x27;s least popular up to that date, reaching only No. 158 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. &quot;Stop Your Motor&quot; marked the end of the Association&#x27;s tenure at Warner Brothers.

In early 1972, they resurfaced on Columbia with &quot;Waterbeds in Trinidad!&quot; (April 1972), produced by Lewis Merenstein (best known for producing Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;). The album fared even less well than &quot;Stop Your Motor&quot;, reaching No. 194, while a single of the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful&#x27;s &quot;Darlin&#x27; Be Home Soon&quot; failed to break the Hot 100.

===Breakup and reformation===

For their 1972 tour, the group expanded, bringing in first session bass player Wolfgang Melz, and then Mike Berkowitz on drums, to add more musical versatility on stage and free up Brian Cole and Ted Bluechel to concentrate on singing. But on August 2, 1972, 29-year-old Cole was found dead in his Los Angeles home of a heroin overdose.

For the rest of the 1970s, the Association was in a state of flux, releasing singles intermittently along with sporadic touring.

In September 1972 Kirkman departed, as did Melz and Berkowitz later on that fall. The group was then moved over to the CBS distributed Mums label and put out a new single, Albert Hammond&#x27;s &quot;Names, Tags, Numbers &amp; Labels&quot;, in February 1973. It failed to make much of an impression, though, and the label&#x27;s funding for a hoped for album by the group never materialized. Mums folded by the end of 1974.
In late 1972, the remaining quintet of Alexander, Bluechel, Yester, Ramos and Thompson brought in new members Maurice Miller (vocals, drums, percussion, formerly of Charles Wright &amp; the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band) and David Vaught (vocals, bass, fresh from a stint in the band Rosebud and later a member of the Lopez Beatles, who later played in the first lineup of Roger McGuinn&#x27;s Thunderbyrd in 1976 and who died on March 20, 2013, from pancreatic cancer) and continued touring.

Jim Yester left in the late summer of 1973 and was briefly replaced by his brother Jerry (who, like Vaught, had just played in Rosebud). Jim Yester returned a short time later when Alexander left in late 1973, eventually to join Giguere and former Honey Ltd. female vocalists Alex Sliwin, Joan Sliwin and Marsha Temmer in a new outfit, Bijou. Jerry Yester stayed with the Association until the end of 1974 and pianist Thompson also left at that time. Dwayne Smith (vocals, keyboards) was then brought in.

In 1975 the band signed with RCA Records where they released two singles, &quot;One Sunday Morning&quot; (produced in Canada by Jack Richardson) and &quot;Sleepy Eyes&quot;. An album called &quot;The Association Bites Back&quot; was to follow but was never released.

During this period, the band was offered a production deal with Mike Curb, who wanted them to record a disco version of the prior hits, &quot;Cherish&quot;, &quot;No Fair At All&quot; and an original song which Larry Brown wrote and sang entitled &quot;It&#x27;s High Time To Get High&quot;. The deal did not go through.

Membership was fluid in 1975–1976. Smith had joined in December 1974 and appeared on &quot;One Sunday Morning&quot; but was replaced by Andy Chapin by the end of 1975. Ramos departed as well in mid-1975 and was replaced by Art Johnson, then the aforementioned Larry Brown (vocals, guitar). The increased tour schedule led to Chapin&#x27;s departure in 1976 (he later played for artist Ricky Nelson and perished along with Nelson and his band when his plane crashed on December 31, 1985). Chapin was replaced, first by Jay Gruska, who then left for a stint with Three Dog Night, and then by David Morgan (who later joined Three Dog Night himself) in mid-1976.

In 1977 Bluechel, Jim Yester, and the current lineup recorded new versions of &quot;Windy&quot;, &quot;Cherish&quot;, &quot;Never My Love&quot;, &quot;Along Comes Mary&quot; and &quot;Everything That Touches You&quot; with session players for K-tel Records that later ended up on a 1983 album collection, &quot;Back to Back&quot;, where one half of the record was the Association songs and the other half tunes by the Turtles.

During the spring of 1977, Brown left to concentrate on session work and keyboardist Ric Ulsky joined, leaving Jim Yester as sole guitarist in the lineup. But by the summer of that same year, with the prime gigs proving to be fewer and far between, Yester left, leaving Bluechel as the only original member. Yester was replaced by lead guitarist Cliff Woolley and the group had two keyboardists for a short time in 1977–78, Ulsky and David Morgan, before Morgan was succeeded by guitarist/singer John William Tuttle (son of makeup artist William Tuttle; John died on August 17, 1991, at age 41 of a perforated ulcer in Van Nuys, California).

Russ Levine (who had played with Bobby Womack, Donna Summer and Ultimate Spinach) also arrived in 1978 to take over drums from Maurice Miller (who went on to play with Lena Horne, and died of complications from diabetes October 10, 2005, in Burbank, California, at age 73) on drums. A short time after that, guitarist Jack Harris took over from Woolley. Jerry Yester also returned for several gigs with the group in the fall of 1978.

The band dissolved shortly afterward, leaving Bluechel with a huge debt. To help clear away some of it, in November 1978, he leased the group&#x27;s name to a company that put a fake &quot;Association&quot; out on the road.

In September 1979 the surviving key members Kirkman, Alexander, Giguere, Bluechel, Yester and Ramos combined with Richard Thompson and seasoned studio bassist and arranger Ray Pohlman to reunite the Association at the Ambassador Hotel&#x27;s Coconut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles for an HBO special called &quot;Then and Now&quot; (Kirkman was working for HBO at the time). The following year the reunited group also appeared at a charity show hosted in Dallas by Ed McMahon called &quot;Ed McMahon and Company&quot; that ran on the Showtime cable network in August 1980.

This led, in the early 1980s, to the band recording some self-financed demos and then a short-lived deal with Elektra Records resulting in a few singles (one of which, &quot;Dreamer&quot;, reunited them with producer Bones Howe and made the Hot 100 with virtually no promotion) and more touring.

In 1980 the surviving originals (with Ulsky returning in place of Thompson, Levine back on drums subbing for an ill Bluechel and Alexander taking over the bass) went back on the road for a concert tour, putting the short-lived bogus band out of business.

===&quot;Happy Together Again&quot; and the 1960s package tours===

Jim Yester left again in June 1983 and the group added Keith Moret (bass, backing vocals) as Alexander went back to playing guitar. Moret stayed only briefly until Joe LaManno (who had once done a brief fill-in stint with the group back in late 1972) joined during July 1983.

In 1984 the group was invited to appear on the &quot;Happy Together Again&quot; tour, a multi-bill of 1960s acts produced by David Fishof (who had taken over the band&#x27;s management from Pat Colecchio in 1981; Colecchio died of colon cancer on June 3, 2008), headlined by the Turtles, and also including Gary Puckett and Spanky McFarlane of Spanky &amp; Our Gang. Gary&#x27;s brother, Brian Puckett, played drums in the show for Gary and McFarlane and likewise joined the Association for their set as well. During the latter part of the tour, Mike Peed joined on keyboards in place of Ulsky but left himself in November 1984, turning it over to Donni Gougeon (from Joshua Perahia&#x27;s band ). But by the end of the year, there was a mass exodus as Kirkman (who had already turned in his notice in September), Bluechel, LaManno and Brian Puckett all departed.

In February 1985 the band carried on as Alexander, Giguere, Ramos and Gougeon recruited new members: Paul Beach (vocals, bass, who had also played in the &quot;Happy Together Again&quot; show band) and Bruce Pictor (vocals, drums, percussion, who had played alongside Beach in Puckett&#x27;s group in the early 1980s).

Gougeon was replaced in early 1987 by Chris Urmston but was himself succeeded by Paul Holland later the same year. In 1989, when Beach quit, Holland switched over to bass as Gougeon then rejoined for a ten-year stint from 1989 to 1999 before illness in his family called him away. He was replaced by Jordan Cole, son of the band&#x27;s original bassist, Brian Cole; Jordan first played with the band on a Caribbean Christmas cruise in December 1998, when he was asked to fill in for Holland on bass.

Besides the &quot;Happy Together&quot; tour, the group became mainstays on many other 1960s package tours, including the 1988 &quot;Super 60s Tour&quot; with Gary Puckett, the Grass Roots, and the Turtles; and Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand Tour in 1989, alongside the Spinners, the Guess Who and the Drifters, sponsored by VH1.

Alexander turned in his notice in early 1989. Larry Ramos&#x27;s brother Del, who had started audio mixing for the group in the 1970s, and then again in the early 1980s, and had begun adding his voice to the mix from the sound board from 1985 on, also assumed bass duties in 1999 after Holland left to tend to his light and sound company. Bob Werner (vocals, guitar, bass), who had been the band&#x27;s light man and road manager in 1974–75 and fill-in member as needed from 1994 on, was also a member of the group from 1999 to 2008.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the group&#x27;s recorded output was minimal. They recorded a few new tracks and some covers of popular 1960s songs for a few compilation albums on the Hitbound label made through RadioShack&#x27;s Tandy Corporation in the mid-1980s, including their first cover of &quot;Walk Away Renée&quot; that was recorded in collaboration with their original producer, Curt Boettcher, for the Mike Love and Dean Torrence 1983 cassette tape &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll City&quot;, two Christmas covers contributed to another Radio Shack album, &quot;Scrooge&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Christmas&quot; (that was also a 1984 TV special), and an album of 1960s tunes called &quot;New Memories&quot; (1983). They also re-recorded some of their older material and even more cover songs for another album, &quot;Vintage&quot;, for CBS in 1983 and put out yet another album full of covers, &quot;The Association 95: A Little Bit More&quot;, in 1995 from On Track Records (based in New York City), produced by John Allen Orofino and Stan Vincent. &quot;A Little Bit More&quot; featured single was their second remake of the Left Banke&#x27;s &quot;Walk Away Renée&quot;.

Over the years the group were sometimes visited by former members: Bluechel and Alexander sat in on a few of their 2001 shows, while Paul Holland guested on their DVD, &quot;Pop Legends Live!&quot;, which came out in 2005. And in September 2003, they were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, joined by Yester, Alexander, Kirkman and Bluechel at the induction ceremony at Cafaro Field in Niles, Ohio. Yester, Alexander, Kirkman and Bluechel again rejoined the others for the taping of a PBS 1960s rock music special &quot;60s Experience&quot; on December 9, 2004, at Dover Downs Showroom in Dover, Delaware.

In 2007 David Jackson (bass, guitar, formerly of Hearts &amp; Flowers and Dillard &amp; Clark) came into the group for a brief stint when Del Ramos was ill, then Jim Yester returned to sub for Werner. After which, Werner and Yester alternated in the group until late 2008 when Werner left altogether.

Also in 2007, they joined Barry Manilow on a remake combining their two biggest hits, &quot;Cherish&quot; and &quot;Windy&quot;, that was released on his &quot;Greatest Hits of the &#x27;60s&quot; album.

In 2008 drummer Pictor underwent back surgery. Blair Anderson (Yester&#x27;s friend from the New Four Preps) sat in for Pictor until he was able to rejoin his bandmates that November.

By 2010, the band included Giguere, Ramos, Jim Yester, Del Ramos, Pictor and Jordan Cole. The Association continued to tour, mostly on bills with similar styled acts of the late 1960s, like the Grass Roots, the Buckinghams, Tommy James and Gary Puckett.

During the summer of 2011, the Association carried a heavy touring schedule throughout the U.S. as part of the &quot;Happy Together: 2011&quot; tour, along with the Grass Roots, Mark Lindsay, the Buckinghams and the Turtles featuring Flo &amp; Eddie. The &quot;Happy Together&quot; appearances featured only Giguere, Ramos and Yester, who were backed up by the &quot;Happy Together&quot; show band.

In late 2011, Ramos was sidelined due to illness, so guitarist Godfrey Townsend (from the &quot;Happy Together&quot; and &quot;Hippiefest&quot; back-up bands) subbed for him. In January 2012, Alexander came back to the band as Ramos&#x27;s stand-in and stayed after Ramos returned in March.

In 2013 Alexander, Giguere, Ramos and Yester became part of the &quot;Where the Action Is&quot; tour that included Mary Wilson of the Supremes, Paul Revere and the Raiders and Mitch Ryder.

&quot;Shindig Magazine&quot; named the Now Sounds reissue of the album &quot;The Association&quot; the best reissue of 2013.

In January 2014 it was announced that both Giguere and Ramos would be retiring from touring. Giguere was to move behind the scenes to the group&#x27;s management, while Ramos&#x27;s final performance with the group was a cancer benefit concert on February 24, 2014, at the Blue Fox Theater in Grangeville, Idaho. Upon returning from spending his 72nd birthday in his homeland of Hawaii, Ramos died from melanoma on April 30, 2014. After Ramos&#x27; death, former member Paul Holland was brought back into the group, this time as a guitarist/vocalist.

Since 2014, founding members Jim Yester and Jules Alexander have been leading the current line-up of the Association, which includes Bruce Pictor, Paul Holland, Del Ramos, and Jordan Cole.

In the summers of 2015, 2017 and 2018, the Association again joined the &#x27;Happy Together&#x27; tour.

The Association was inducted into the Pop Music Hall of Fame&#x27;s 2016 class in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

In May 2016 Texas guitarist Paul Wilson filled in for Paul Holland at an Association performance in Monroe, Wisconsin. Wilson also subbed for Holland on two occasions in 2018: two shows during the &quot;Flower Power Cruise&quot; in late February in the Caribbean, and then again in May for one show at the Golden Nugget Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. Then in October 2018, Jim Yester was unable to perform two concerts. For the appearances in Red Rock, Oklahoma, and Bangor, Maine, the lineup consisted of Alexander, Del Ramos, Cole, Pictor, Holland and Wilson. Concerts resumed in 2019 with the regular lineup.

In 2018 the first (unofficial) biography of the band – &quot;The Association Cherish&quot; – written by British author Malcolm C. Searles, was published via Dojotone Publications in the UK detailing the group&#x27;s 50-year career.

Art Johnson, who played guitar briefly for the group in 1975, died in 2018.

The Association were recipients of the Rock Justice Awards on January 19, 2019, at Village Studios in Los Angeles. All five surviving founding members – Kirkman, Alexander, Yester, Giguere and Bluechel – showed up to receive their awards. Ramos and founding member Cole also received awards.

In March 2020 Russ Giguere&#x27;s autobiography (co-written with Ashley Wren Collins), &quot;Along Comes The Association: Beyond Folk Rock and Three-Piece Suits&quot;, was released.

Mid-70s Association keyboardist Dwayne Smith died in June 2020.

Bob Page (born May 13, 1943) died on December 24, 2022, at age 79 from a head injury in Faial Island.

Terry Kirkman died on September 23, 2023, at the age of 83.

<text>Salta () is the capital and largest city in the Argentine province of the same name. With a population of 618,375 according to the 2010 census, it is also the 7th most-populous city in Argentina. The city serves as the cultural and economic center of the Valle de Lerma Metropolitan Area (Spanish: &quot;Área Metropolitana del Valle de Lerma&quot;, AMVL), which is home to over 50.9% of the population of Salta Province and also includes the municipalities of La Caldera, Vaqueros, Campo Quijano, Rosario de Lerma, Cerrillos, La Merced and San Lorenzo. Salta is the seat of the Capital Department, the most populous department in the province.

==History==

Salta was founded on April 16, 1582, by the Spanish conquistador Hernando de Lerma, who intended the settlement to be an outpost between Lima, Peru and Buenos Aires. The origin of the name &quot;Salta&quot; is a matter of conjecture, with several theories being advanced to explain it.

During the war of independence, the city became a commercial and military strategic point between Peru and the Argentine cities. Between 1816 and 1821, the city was led by local military leader General Martín Miguel de Güemes, who under the command of General José de San Martín, defended the city and surrounding area from Spanish forces coming from further north.

Salta emerged from the War of Independence politically in disarray and financially bankrupt, a condition that lingered throughout much of the 19th century. However, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the arrival of Italian, Spanish, British, and Arab immigrants, particularly Syrians and Lebanese, revived trade and agriculture all over the area while further enhancing the city&#x27;s multicultural flavor.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Salta has a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), and it is characterized by pleasant weather year-round. Located in the subtropical north, but at an altitude of 1,200 metres, Salta enjoys 4 distinct seasons: summers are warm with frequent thunderstorms, with daytime highs around and pleasant, refreshing nights around . Fall brings dry weather, pleasant days at around and mild nights at around . By winter, the dryness is extreme, with very few rain episodes. Nights are cool at on average, but daytime heating allows for high temperatures of . Snow is rare and frost is quite common, with temperatures reaching down to during the coldest nights. Spring brings sunny weather with warm days and mild nights: days range from with nights between . Salta&#x27;s winters are rather warm for its elevation and far inland position for a location being just outside the tropics.

Of the over of rain that Salta receives yearly, over 80% falls between December and March, when thunderstorms occur almost daily. During the rest of the year, blue skies dominate the region. Seemingly incessant summer thunderstorms greatly rejuvenate the surrounding mountainous landscape, making the various hills and mountainsides within the vicinity of the city green and lush once again. Salta receives 1863 hours of bright sunshine each year or about 5.1 hours per day. The highest recorded temperature was on November 28, 1972, while the lowest recorded temperature was on August 5, 1966.


==Attractions==
The city centre features a number of buildings dating back to the 18th and 19th and early 20th centuries. Clockwise around the Ninth of July Square are the neoclassical Cathedral Shrine, the French style Museum of Contemporary Art, the Cabildo (in former times, the city&#x27;s town hall, nowadays a historical museum) and the neoclassical Museum of High Altitude Archaeology, which houses artifacts from the Inca civilization, including the mummies of three Inca children. The Plaza is almost completely surrounded by a gallery.

Within walking distance of the July 9th Square are the Saint Francis Church and the city&#x27;s three pedestrian streets: &quot;Alberdi&quot;, &quot;Florida&quot; and &quot;Caseros&quot;. The three blocks in Balcarce street closest to the train station are now the centre of night life in Salta, with restaurants, pubs and cafés on both sidewalks and concerts every night.

Rising in the east is San Bernardo Hill. Its summit, from which visitors can get a view of the city and the entire valley, can be reached by car, cable car or stairway.

==Culture and arts==

Salta is probably the most Spanish city in Argentina by physical appearance: so much so that tourists visiting from Spain often find a strong resemblance between Salta and Andalucian cities. The local culture, however, is a blend of Spanish and gaucho (mestizo, criollo, both indigenous and non-indigenous) traditions, lending the city a distinctive identity, somewhat different from the more European-like metropolises to the south.

The city boasts three theatres, several museums (one of which exhibits the perfectly preserved bodies of year old Inca children sacrificed in the Andes to Inca gods), and a busy calendar of art exhibitions, shows, music festivals, and other cultural events.

One of the main activities in Salta is the April Culture Festival, which lasts the entire month and offers a wide variety of activities such as cultural performances, a handcraft exposition, and live orchestral performances.

==Sports==
Salta residents, like most Argentines, are very enthusiastic about football. The most important local clubs are Juventud Antoniana, Gimnasia y Tiro de Salta, and Central Norte; many faithful fans follow each. These three clubs currently play in the third national division.

Other locally popular sports include baseball (a game in which Salta players excel nationally), basketball, volleyball, rugby, and mountaineering.

The main sporting venue in Salta is the Padre Ernesto Martearena Stadium; the Gimnasia y Tiro and Juventud Antoniana stadiums also see many athletic matches. The largest roofed facility in the city is the Ciudad de Salta Stadium, chiefly used for basketball, volleyball, and boxing.

Over the last forty years, Salta has played host to such high-profile international sporting events as the 1990 Basketball World Cup, the 1994 Camel Trophy, the 2002 Volleyball World Cup, and the 2009 Hockey Champions Challenge. The Argentina national rugby union team, the &quot;Pumas&quot;, have played in Salta against Italy (2005), England (2009), (2013), South Africa (2016) and Scotland (2022). Top football clubs, including Boca Juniors, River Plate and Racing, have played friendly games in Salta in summer, off-season matches.

The city was used as a stage on the route of the 2014 and 2016 Dakar Rally.

==Politics of Salta==
Salta is governed by a city council of 21 members. Following the elections of November 2013, the Workers&#x27; Party has 9 seats, the Justicialist Party has 6 seats, and there are 6 others.

==Trivia==
* The film &quot;Taras Bulba&quot;, starring Yul Brynner and Tony Curtis, was largely shot in the hills west of the city, near San Lorenzo. 
* Actor John Schneider (&quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; and &quot;Smallville&quot;) was part of the cast of &quot;Cocaine Wars&quot;, another film shot in Salta. 
* Two Hollywood celebrities have married Salta natives: Matt Damon (to Luciana Bozán Barroso), and Robert Duvall (to Luciana Pedraza).

==Transportation==
The city&#x27;s commercial airline needs are served by Aeropuerto Internacional Martín Miguel de Güemes, with service on three domestic airlines, including Aerolineas Argentinas, which is Argentina&#x27;s largest domestic and international air carrier, and low cost airline Flybondi.

Catamarca is also the touristic centre of the province, with its colonial architecture, and serves as a hub to many touristic points and excursions, hiking, mountain-bike tours, horse riding, and wine tasting.

== Transportation ==
San Fernando del Valle is served by Coronel Felipe Varela International Airport (CTC/SANC), with flights to Buenos Aires-AEP.

==History and politics==
An initial settlement, called Londres, was established here by Spanish colonists in 1558; a permanent settlement was not founded until 1683, by Fernando de Mendoza y Mate de Luna. &quot;Catamarca&quot; comes from Quechua, meaning &quot;fortress on the slope&quot;.

The city, which had only 8,000 inhabitants in 1882 and was reached by a railway line in 1888, grew very slowly, and the region remained poor even in the middle of the 20th century.

== Climate ==
The warm semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) of Catamarca has an annual average of 20 °C with an average maximum temperature of in summer with several days typically exceeding , and an average minimum of in winter. Temperatures in the high mountains can drop down to , however in the city they rarely go below freezing. The Valle (valley) receives relatively little rainfall from summer thunderstorms; most of the precipitation is received in the form of snow on the high mountain tops surrounding the city.
==Economy==
Agriculture is San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca&#x27;s chief economic activity; however, low rainfall makes irrigation necessary. 
Fruit and grapes are grown in the oasis areas near the city, and there is a considerable production of wine. Other local production includes preserves and handwoven ponchos.

Cotton and cattle are important economically, as well as mining at the &quot;Farallón Negro&quot;, &quot;Bajo de la Alumbrera&quot; and &quot;Capillitas&quot; mines where gold, silver, copper and tin.

==Sports==
The most successful football clubs in Catamarca are San Lorenzo de Alem, Atlético Policial, Sarmiento, and Villa Cubas.

Catamarca was a host of the 1982 FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s World Championship at the Polideportivo Fray Mamerto Esquiú.

<doc id="592806" wikidata="Q1190039" url="?curid=592806" title="Sports entertainment">
<text>Sports entertainment is a type of spectacle which presents an ostensibly competitive event using a high level of theatrical flourish and extravagant presentation, with the purpose of entertaining an audience. Unlike typical sports and games, which are conducted for competition, sportsmanship, physical exercise or personal recreation, the primary product of sports entertainment is performance for an audience&#x27;s benefit. Commonly, but not in all cases, the outcomes are predetermined; as this is an open secret, it is not considered to be match fixing.

==History==

The term &quot;sports entertainment&quot; was coined by the former World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) chairman Vince McMahon during the 1980s as a marketing term to describe the industry of professional wrestling, primarily to potential advertisers, although precursors date back to February 1935, when &quot;Toronto Star&quot; sports editor Lou Marsh described professional wrestling as &quot;sportive entertainment&quot;. In 1989, the WWF used the phrase in a case it made to the New Jersey Senate for classifying professional wrestling as &quot;sports entertainment&quot; and thus not subject to regulation like a directly competitive sport.

Some sports entertainment events represent variants of actual sports, such as exhibition basketball with the Harlem Globetrotters. Others modify sport for entertainment purposes: many types of professional wrestling (which derived from traditional wrestling), and more recently many of the various mascot races held at numerous Major League Baseball games in-between innings. Roller derby was presented as a popular form of sports entertainment in the 1970s, though modern versions are legitimate competition.

==Perceptions==
Sports entertainment has a stigma of being mindless, low-level pop culture, in some cases glorifying violence for the sake of entertainment, and has been criticized as such in popular media, often through lampooning.

<doc id="592807" wikidata="Q326996" url="?curid=592807" title="G. William Domhoff">
<text>George William &quot;Bill&quot; Domhoff (born August 6, 1936) is a Distinguished Professor Emeritus and research professor of psychology and sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a founding faculty member of UCSC&#x27;s Cowell College. He is best known as the author of several best-selling sociology books, including &quot;Who Rules America?&quot; and its seven subsequent editions (1967 through 2022).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Domhoff was born in Youngstown, Ohio, and raised in Rocky River, 12 miles from Cleveland. His parents were George William Domhoff Sr., a loan executive, and Helen S. (Cornett) Domhoff, a secretary at George Sr.&#x27;s company.

In high school, Domhoff was a three-sport athlete (in baseball, basketball, and football), wrote for his school newspaper&#x27;s sports section, served on student council, and won a contest to be the batboy for the Cleveland Indians. He graduated as co-valedictorian.

===Education===
Domhoff received a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology at Duke University (1958), where he finished freshman year tenth in his class, wrote for the &quot;Duke Chronicle&quot;, played baseball as an outfielder, and tutored the student athletes. As an undergraduate, he also wrote for &quot;The Durham Sun&quot; and received his Phi Beta Kappa key. He later earned a Master of Arts degree in psychology at Kent State University (1959), and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in psychology at the University of Miami (1962).

===Family===
Domhoff has four children. His son-in-law was a Major League Baseball player, Glenallen Hill.

==Career==
===Academia===
Domhoff was an assistant professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles, for three years in the early 1960s. In 1965, he joined the founding faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC), as an assistant professor at Cowell College. He became an associate professor in 1969, a professor in 1976, and a Distinguished Professor in 1993. After his retirement in 1994, he has continued to publish and teach classes as a research professor.

Over the course of his career at UCSC, Domhoff served in many capacities at various times: acting dean of the Division of Social Sciences, chair of the Sociology Department, chair of the Academic Senate, chair of the Committee on Academic Personnel, and chair of the Statewide Committee on Preparatory Education.
In 2007, he received the University of California&#x27;s Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award, which honors the post-retirement contributions of UC faculty.

===Sociology===
Domhoff&#x27;s first book, &quot;Who Rules America?&quot; (1967), was a 1960s sociological best-seller. It argues that the United States is dominated by an elite ownership class both politically and economically. This work was partially inspired by Domhoff&#x27;s experience of the Civil Rights Movement and projects that he assigned for his social psychology courses to map how different organizations were connected. It built on E. Digby Baltzell&#x27;s 1958 book &quot;Philadelphia Gentlemen: The Making of a National Upper Class&quot;, C. Wright Mills&#x27; 1956 book &quot;The Power Elite&quot;, Robert A. Dahl&#x27;s 1961 book &quot;Who Governs?&quot; and Paul Sweezy&#x27;s work on interest groups, and Floyd Hunter&#x27;s 1953 book &quot;Community Power Structure&quot; and 1957 book &quot;Top Leadership, USA.&quot;

&quot;Who Rules&quot; was followed by a series of sociology and power structure books like &quot;C. Wright Mills and the Power Elite&quot; (1968), &quot;Bohemian Grove and Other Retreats&quot; (1974), and three more best-sellers: &quot;The Higher Circles&quot; (1970), &quot;The Powers That Be&quot; (1979), and &quot;Who Rules America Now?&quot; (1983).

Domhoff has written seven updates to &quot;Who Rules America?&quot; Every edition has been used as a sociology textbook. He also has a &quot;Who Rules America?&quot; website, hosted by UCSC.

===Psychology===
In addition to his work in sociology, Domhoff has been a pioneer in the scientific study of dreams. In the 1960s, he worked closely with Calvin S. Hall, who had developed a content analysis system for dreams. He has continued to study dreams, and his latest research advocates a neurocognitive basis for future dream research.

He and his research partner, Adam Schneider, maintain two websites dedicated to quantitative dream research: DreamResearch.net and DreamBank.net.

<text>Resistencia () is the capital and largest city of the province of Chaco in north-eastern Argentina. According to the 2010 census, the population of the city proper was 291,720 inhabitants. It is the anchor of a larger metropolitan area, Greater Resistencia, which comprises at least three more municipalities for a total population of 387,340 as of 2010. This conurbation is the largest in the province, and the eleventh most populous in the country. It is located along the Negro River, a tributary of the much larger Paraná River, opposite the city of Corrientes, Corrientes Province.

The area was originally inhabited by Guaycuru aboriginals such as the Tobas. Their resistance to evangelisation postponed substantial European settlement until the late 19th century. Not until 1865 was a proper settlement established, and on January 27, 1878, Resistencia was formally established as the territorial capital. The national government supported immigration, and in 1878 the first Italian immigrants arrived. The first City Council was made up entirely of members originating from that country.

==History==

===Colonial period===
The area where Resistencia lies was the site of the Guaycuru peoples, pedestrian tribes that live on hunting and fishing. Of these, the Abipón to the south of Bermejo were the first to advance towards central and southern Chaco. The Abipones were composed of three groups: the Riicagé (people of the open countryside), the nacaigetergé (people of the forest) and the Yaaucanigá (people of the river), each with their own dialect. The Payaguá settled on the Paraguay River at north of the Bermejo river, and they were engaged in trade and piracy along the Paraná-Paraguay river.

The Spanish had traversed the entire perimeter of the Chaco between 1541 and 1580. In 1588, Corrientes was founded on the opposite bank of the Parana.

===Foundation===
Resistencia was founded on January 27, 1878, the date on which the initial measurement was approved (executed by Arturo Seelstrang) and officially created.

The date of February 2 is celebrated as the arrival date of the first Friulian immigrants. However, historical studies agree that it was the same day of creation of the colony. The initial colonization process was the result of an official policy of settlement of this region based on Immigration Law No. 817, widespread in Europe during those years. The progress was partly due to the contribution of institutions such as the Italian Society, founded by the first Italians and which brought together a large part of the professional community, including medical partners, architects, lawyers, politicians, among others.

===20th century===
In 1953 the National Territory of the Chaco was declared a province and Resistencia, which was already the capital of the National Territory, becomes the provincial capital. On July 3, 1939, Pope Pius XII split the diocese of Santa Fe to create the Diocese of Resistencia, which was elevated to an archdiocese on April 1, 1984, by John Paul II.

In the decade of the 1950s, during the governorship of Felipe Gallardo and Deolindo Felipe Bittel, the construction of the Resistencia International Airport was initiated. The public transport service Resistencia-Barranqueras was created, along with numerous buildings for schools, police stations, municipalities and health centers.

==Geography==
The city is located along the Negro River, a tributary of the much larger Paraná River, opposite the city of Corrientes, Corrientes Province.
===Climate===
Resistencia is one of the warmest cities in Argentina, and is known for its extremely hot, humid summer weather with frequent lightning. The climate is humid subtropical (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), with a cooler, dryer season and a long, humid summer. Autumn and spring are often marked by sudden transitions from summer weather patterns to winter weather patterns.

During the summer, temperatures attain highs of on a daily basis, and occasionally up to . The record temperature is on October 16, 2014. Nights are warm and sticky, between , and afternoon thunderstorms are common. The transition to autumn is slow: March&#x27;s temperatures are very similar to midsummer, and April is still warm with an average high of and a low of , and rainfall is very abundant: during that month.
The dry, cool season starts in May and lasts until September. During its peak in June and July, the average high is and the average low is , with rainfall below in a month. These averages reflect the fact that there are two distinct weather patterns that alternate in the winter: the northerly, tropical pattern, and the southerly pattern of the Pampas: thus, there are periods of very warm, dry weather () with warm nights () followed by strong southerly winds, often accompanied with drizzle and temperatures that hover around for days at a time (creating a surprisingly cold feeling), followed by dry air and blue skies and cold nights () and pleasant, cool days between ). Light frost occurs under very calm conditions with cold air in place; usually measured temperatures will hover between but frost will cover the ground. On occasion, however, under very cold weather patterns, measured temperatures reach , with a record low of on June 29, 1996.

==Economy==

The city&#x27;s economy, originally based on agriculture and trade, has diversified into the service sector in recent decades.

==Culture==
Resistencia is known nationally as the &quot;city of sculptures&quot; and &quot;open-air museum&quot; because of the more than 500 monuments and other works of art spread among its streets.
The city has organized a Biennial International Sculptures Contest since 1988; after each contest the sculptures remain in the city for public display in parks or sidewalks. Since 1997, the event has been sponsored by UNESCO. Resistencia is also home to a number of museums, including the René Bruseau Provincial Museum of Fine Arts, the Augusto Schulz Museum of Natural History, the Juan Alfredo Martinet Museum of Anthropology, the Ichoalay Cultural Museum, and the Ertivio Acosta Museum of Man in Chaco.

==Transport==
The city has been served by Resistencia International Airport since 1965; its terminal, completed in 1971, was designed by renowned modernist architect Amancio Williams. Its access via highways includes National Route 11 (north to south), National Route 16 (westbound), and the General Belgrano Bridge, which has connected Resistencia to its twin port city of Corrientes since 1973. Following the closure of rail lines in the area during the privatization of the nation&#x27;s railways in the early 1990s, the city&#x27;s rail links were re-established with the opening of the provincially funded Sefecha line in 1997.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Resistencia is twinned with:
* Udine, Italy (1978)
* Trento, Italy
* Asunción, Paraguay (2006)
* Tarija, Bolivia
* São Vicente, Brazil (2006)

<doc id="592809" wikidata="Q44208" url="?curid=592809" title="Rawson, Chubut">
<text>Rawson () is the capital of the Argentine province of Chubut, in Patagonia. It has 24,616 inhabitants in 2010, and it is the chief town of the Rawson Department.

The city is named after Guillermo Rawson (1821–1890), Argentine Minister of the Interior, who supported the Welsh settlement in Argentina.

Rawson is located about south of Buenos Aires, some from Trelew, and it is served by the Almirante Marco Andrés Zar Airport in Trelew. It lies on both sides of the Chubut River.
The city has a fishing port, Puerto Rawson, on the Atlantic coast, down the river.

==History==

Rawson was the first town founded by the Welsh immigrants who sailed on the clipper &quot;Mimosa&quot; in 1865 to establish a national colony.

At the time of founding remains of a mud-walled fortress existed on the site. Settlers dwelled in the fortress various months while they explored the surroundings and built permanent houses. It has been posited that the fort was built in 1853 by non-Indigenous hunters who entered the area to hunt feral cattle. The fortress was known by various names by the settlers. One name was &quot;Yr Hen Amddiffynfa&quot; meaning &quot;Old Fortress&quot;, another was &quot;Caer Antur&quot; meaning &quot;Fort Adventure&quot;. Henry Libanus Jones had called it &quot;Fuerte Paz&quot; in his 1861 &quot;Explanatory notes on two maps of Patagonia&quot;.

Between 1885 and 1890 many Italians settled in Rawson. Initially many Italians worked as railway navvies but in time many moved to work in 
trade. 

The first bridge over the Chubut in Rawson was built of wood in 1889 by the carpenter and Welsh-language poet Griffith Griffiths (1829–1909), who wrote under the bardic name &#x27; and established the Patagonia Gorsedd of Bards. This bridge was destroyed by a flood ten years later, and was replaced by an iron bridge in 1917. In 2001 a decision was made to rename the iron bridge as &#x27; (poet&#x27;s bridge) in honor of Griffiths. A plaque was installed at the bridge with information on Griffiths.

Rawson was flooded in 1899 and 1901. While there had been floods before, these floods caused a partial depopulation of the town with many choosing to resettle in Trelew. Trelew was temporarily made capital of Chubut in 1903 as Rawson recovered from the floods. This fuelled a rivalry between the towns, which was further compounded by differences in their ethnic make-up as Rawson was more Catholic and had a higher proportion of Argentines, Italians and Spanish relative to Trelew. Rawson regained the capital status soon thereafter.

==Climate==
Rawson experiences a borderline cold desert (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;)/cold semi-desert (&quot;BSk&quot;) climate with hot summers, cool winters and low precipitation year-round.

<text>Santiago del Estero (, Spanish for &quot;Saint-James-Upon-The-Lagoon&quot;) is the capital of Santiago del Estero Province in northern Argentina. It has a population of 252,192 inhabitants, () making it the twelfth largest city in the country, with a surface area of 2,116 km2. It lies on the Dulce River and on National Route 9, at a distance of 1,042 km north-northwest from Buenos Aires. Estimated to be 455 years old, Santiago del Estero was the first city founded by Spanish settlers in the territory that is now Argentina. As such, it is nicknamed &quot;Madre de Ciudades&quot; (Mother of Cities). Similarly, it has been officially declared the &quot;mother of cities and cradle of folklore.&quot;

The city houses the National University of Santiago del Estero, founded in 1973, and the &quot;Universidad Católica&quot;, founded in 1960. Other points of interest include the city&#x27;s Cathedral, the Santo Domingo Convent, and the Provincial Archeology Museum.

The Santiago del Estero Airport is located 6 kilometres north of the city, and has regular flights to Buenos Aires and San Miguel de Tucumán.

The climate is subtropical with cool dry winters and wet humid summers. It receives an average annual precipitation of 600 mm, and the climate is warm.

Santiago del Estero and its surroundings are home to about 100,000 speakers of the local variety of Quechua, making it the southernmost outpost of the language of the Incas. It is one of the few indigenous languages surviving in modern Argentina.

==History==

After a series of exploratory expeditions from Chile starting in 1543, &quot;Santiago del Estero del Nuevo Maestrazgo&quot; was founded on July 25, 1553, by Francisco de Aguirre (although some historians consider its true foundation to be in 1550). Although it is the oldest city in Argentina, it preserves little of its former Spanish colonial architecture, except for several churches.

In 1576, the governor of a province in northern Argentina commissioned the military to search for a huge mass of iron, which he had heard that Natives used for their weapons. They called the area &quot;Heavenly Fields,&quot; translated into Spanish as Campo del Cielo. (This term now refers to a protected area situated on the border between the provinces of Chaco and Santiago del Estero, where a group of iron meteorites were found, estimated as having fallen in a Holocene impact event some 4,000–5,000 years ago. In 2015, Police arrested four alleged smugglers trying to steal more than a ton of protected meteorites.)

The city was the capital of the Intendency of San Miguel de Tucumán during the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, and first seat of its bishop; those were later moved to Salta and Córdoba respectively.

Santiago del Estero stands in the middle of an extensive but largely semi-arid agricultural region. Originally a dry forest area, the abundance of quebracho attracted timber industries of British capital during the 19th century, leading to extensive deforestation; the British-owned Central Argentine Railway reached the city in 1884.

The province, in 1948, elected a young Peronist activist, Carlos Arturo Juárez, as its Governor. Santiago del Estero&#x27;s central political figure during the second half of the 20th century, he soon became indispensable to local politics (even out of power). A true &quot;Caudillo&quot; (strongman), his amiable demeanor belied a record of ruthlessness towards opposition figures.

The construction of the nearby Quiroga Dam (on the Río Dulce) in 1950, eased the city&#x27;s chronic water shortage and spurred the growth of local agriculture, based on cotton and olives. The city&#x27;s first school of higher education, the &quot;Instituto Superior del Profesorado&quot; (a normal school), was established in 1953. The city developed a sizable manufacturing sector based on textile mills and other light industry from the 1950s on, though the public sector remained the largest employer. Santiago del Estero&#x27;s population reached 100,000 in 1970.

The province, however, remained one of the poorest in Argentina, falling further behind. In 1993, the city made international headlines when rioting erupted around the governor&#x27;s mansion. What began as a protest by government workers who had not been paid in three months, soon grew to 4,000 demonstrators who burned cars, destroyed government buildings and even invaded the homes of prominent politicians.

Juárez, by the 1990s, was readily ordering his opponents&#x27; deaths, notably that of former Governor César Iturre in 1996 and of Bishop Gerardo Sueldo in 1998. The 2002 deaths of two local women, however, were traced to Juárez&#x27;s assassin, Antonio Musa Azar, and in an attempt to retain power, Juárez resigned (appointing his wife, , governor).

The bid failed, however, as President Néstor Kirchner signed an executive order removing Mrs. Juárez from her post in March 2004. The Juárez couple, in their nineties, subsequently lived under house arrest in the city of Santiago del Estero; the former strongman died in 2010.

==Transport==

===Public ===

The Vicecomodoro Ángel de la Paz Aragonés Airport was built in 1959 and currently has flights to and from Buenos Aires operated by Aerolíneas Argentinas. In recent years it has been refurbished and expanded given that it was operating at full capacity.

The city&#x27;s main road connection to other provinces is National Route 9, which connects it to the cities of Cordoba, Rosario and Buenos Aires to the south and San Miguel de Tucumán, Salta and San Salvador de Jujuy to the north. National Route 64 connects the city to San Fernando del Valle de Catamarca, the capital of Catamarca Province. In November 2008, a new long-distance bus terminal was inaugurated, replacing the previous bus terminal in the city.

===Railway===
The city has historically been connected through the Belgrano and Mitre railways. An elevated commuter rail line known as Tren al Desarrollo is under construction in the city, connecting Santiago del Estero to the city of La Banda.

Notes:
1 &quot;Under construction, work in progress&quot;

==Climate==

Santiago del Estero lies in a transition zone between more temperate climates, typical of the Pampa, and the hotter climates of the Chaco region: while daytime highs are decidedly very hot, nights tend to cool down more than most locations in the Chaco. It has a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) bordering on a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification.

The city is notorious for its very hot summer weather: the average high is and are attained on a regular basis; the highest temperature on record is on November 1, 2009. Nighttime temperatures are in midsummer. There is a very short, humid season between December and February, with up to monthly; however, this rain falls during a handful of very strong thunderstorms, and so the amount that falls on a given year is extremely variable.

Fall is still warm, with average highs of in April, and lows of . Temperatures can still soar to in this season. Rainfall is scarce, and becomes practically 0 for 5 months: in July, only are expected. Winters bring very pleasant days () with markedly colder nights (under ). Nonetheless, these averages are obtained through an alternance of heat waves and cold waves: short periods of are followed by frosty days with highs around , and sometimes the thermometer fails to reach . The thermometer does descend below , and the record low is on July 18, 1975.

Late in the winter, heat waves become much more common, and in September, are already possible. The pattern of intense heat waves followed by cool, windy weather is typical of spring, which is also very dry in Santiago. The high temperatures, extreme dryness and high winds create a very dusty environment. In October, the average high is already , and rainfall only arrives in late November. December is as hot as January, and the abundant rains make the landscape green for a few months.
Total precipitation is low, , and varies from one year to another.

==Culture==
Some important figures related to the history of Santiago del Estero are Colonel Juan Francisco Borges, who led the local battalion of the Army of the North during the Argentine War of Independence (and an ancestor of writer Jorge Luis Borges), the 19th-century painter Felipe Taboada, as well as Francisco René and Mario Roberto Santucho, founders of the &quot;Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores&quot; (Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party, &quot;PRT&quot;) and the &quot;Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo&quot; (People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army, &quot;ERP&quot;), the two leading guerrilla organizations during the wave of unrest in the 1970s.

The city is home to numerous important Argentine artists, such as Ramon Gómez Cornet, Carlos Sánchez Gramajo, Alfredo Gogna, Ricardo and Rafael Touriño in visual arts, and Jorge Washington Ábalos, Bernardo Canal Feijóo, Clementina Rosa Quenel, Alberto Tasso, Carlos Virgilio Zurita and Julio Carreras (h) in literature.

Santiago&#x27;s musical heritage is one of the most important cultural aspects of the city, with typical folklore chacarera and zamba. Some renowned artists and groups include the Manseros Santiagueños, the Ábalos Brothers (led by Adolfo and Alfredo Ábalos), Jacinto Piedra and Dúo Coplanacu.

== Sports ==
The city is home to the Asociación Atlética Quimsa, 2015 champion of Argentina&#x27;s Liga Nacional de Básquet. The team plays its home games at the Estadio Ciudad de Santiago del Estero.

In 2021, the Estadio Único Madre de Ciudades was inaugurated in Santiago del Estero. The stadium is expected to host ten matches of the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

<text>A gate array is an approach to the design and manufacture of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) using a prefabricated chip with components that are later interconnected into logic devices (e.g. NAND gates, flip-flops, etc.) according to custom order by adding metal interconnect layers in the factory. It was popular during the upheaval in the semiconductor industry in the 1980s, and its usage declined by the end of the 1990s.

Similar technologies have also been employed to design and manufacture analog, analog-digital, and structured arrays, but, in general, these are not called gate arrays.

Gate arrays have also been known as uncommitted logic arrays (&#x27;ULAs&#x27;), which also offered linear circuit functions, and &quot;semi-custom chips&quot;.

== History ==

=== Development ===
Gate arrays had several concurrent development paths. Ferranti in the UK pioneered commercializing bipolar ULA technology, offering circuits of &quot;100 to 10,000 gates and above&quot; by 1983. The company&#x27;s early lead in semi-custom chips, with the initial application of a ULA integrated circuit involving a camera from Rollei in 1972, expanding to &quot;practically all European camera manufacturers&quot; as users of the technology, led to the company&#x27;s dominance in this particular market throughout the 1970s. However, by 1982, as many as 30 companies had started to compete with Ferranti, reducing the company&#x27;s market share to around 30 percent. Ferranti&#x27;s &quot;major competitors&quot; were other British companies such as Marconi and Plessey, both of which had licensed technology from another British company, Micro Circuit Engineering. A contemporary initiative, UK5000, also sought to produce a CMOS gate array with &quot;5,000 usable gates&quot;, with involvement from British Telecom and a number of other major British technology companies.

IBM developed proprietary bipolar master slices that it used in mainframe manufacturing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but never commercialized them externally. Fairchild Semiconductor also flirted briefly in the late 1960s with bipolar arrays diode–transistor logic and transistor-transistor logic called Micromosaic and Polycell.

CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) technology opened the door to the broad commercialization of gate arrays. The first CMOS gate arrays were developed by Robert Lipp in 1974 for International Microcircuits, Inc. (IMI) a Sunnyvale photo-mask shop started by Frank Deverse, Jim Tuttle and Charlie Allen, ex-IBM employees. This first product line employed 7.5 micron single-level metal CMOS technology and ranged from 50 to 400 gates. Computer-aided design (CAD) technology at the time was very rudimentary due to the low processing power available, so the design of these first products was only partially automated.

This product pioneered several features that went on to become standard in future designs. The most important were: the strict organization of n-channel and p-channel transistors in 2-3 row pairs across the chip; and running all interconnect on grids rather than minimum custom spacing, which had been the standard until then. This later innovation paved the way to full automation when coupled with the development of 2-layer CMOS arrays. Customizing these first parts was somewhat tedious and error-prone due to the lack of good software tools. IMI tapped into PC board development techniques to minimize manual customization effort. Chips at the time were designed by hand, drawing all components and interconnecting on precision gridded Mylar sheets, using colored pencils to delineate each processing layer. Rubylith sheets were then cut and peeled to create a (typically) 200x to 400x scale representation of the process layer. This was then photo-reduced to make a 1x mask. Digitization rather than rubylith cutting was just coming in as the latest technology, but initially, it only removed the rubylith stage; drawings were still manual and then &quot;hand&quot; digitized. PC boards, meanwhile, had moved from custom rubylith to PC tape for interconnects. IMI created to-scale photo enlargements of the base layers. Using decals of logic gate connections and PC tape to interconnect these gates, custom circuits could be quickly laid out by hand for these relatively small circuits, and photo-reduced using existing technologies.

After a falling out with IMI, Robert Lipp went on to start California Devices, Inc. (CDI) in 1978 with two silent partners, Bernie Aronson, and Brian Tighe. CDI quickly developed a product line competitive to IMI and, shortly thereafter, a 5-micron silicon gate single-layer product line with densities of up to 1,200 gates. A couple of years later, CDI followed up with &quot;channel-less&quot; gate arrays that reduced the row blockages caused by a more complex silicon underlayer that pre-wired the individual transistor connections to locations needed for common logic functions, simplifying the first-level metal interconnect. This increased chip densities by 40%, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.

=== Innovation ===
Early gate arrays were low-performance and relatively large and expensive compared to state-of-the-art n-MOS technology then being used for custom chips. CMOS technology was being driven by very low-power applications such as watch chips and battery-operated portable instrumentation, not performance. They were also well under the performance of the existing dominant logic technology, transistor–transistor logic. However, there were many niche applications where they were invaluable, particularly in low power, size reduction, portable and aerospace applications as well as time-to-market sensitive products. Even these small arrays could replace a board full of transistor–transistor logic gates if performance were not an issue. A common application was combining a number of smaller circuits that were supporting a larger LSI circuit on a board was affectionately known as &quot;garbage collection&quot;. And the low cost of development and custom tooling made the technology available to the most modest budgets. Early gate arrays played a large part in the CB craze in the 1970s as well as a vehicle for the introduction of other later mass-produced products such as modems and cell phones.

By the early 1980s, gate arrays were starting to move out of their niche applications to the general market. Several factors in technology and markets were converging. Size and performance were increasing; automation was maturing; the technology became &quot;hot&quot; when in 1981 IBM introduced its new flagship 3081 mainframe with CPU comprising gate arrays. They were used in a consumer product, the ZX81, and new entrants to the market increased visibility and credibility.

In 1981, Wilfred Corrigan, Bill O&#x27;Meara, Rob Walker, and Mitchell &quot;Mick&quot; Bohn founded LSI Logic. Their initial intention was to commercialize emitter coupled logic gate arrays, but discovered the market was quickly moving towards CMOS. Instead, they licensed CDI&#x27;s silicon gate CMOS line as a second source. This product established them in the market while they developed their own proprietary 5-micron 2-layer metal line. This latter product line was the first commercial gate array product amenable to full automation. LSI developed a suite of proprietary development tools that allowed users to design their own chip from their own facility by remote login to LSI Logic&#x27;s system.

Sinclair Research ported an enhanced ZX80 design to a ULA chip for the ZX81, and later used a ULA in the ZX Spectrum. A compatible chip was made in Russia as T34VG1. Acorn Computers used several ULA chips in the BBC Micro, and later a single ULA for the Acorn Electron. Many other manufacturers from the time of the home computer boom period used ULAs in their machines. The IBM PC took over much of the personal computer market, and the sales volumes made full-custom chips more economical. Commodore&#x27;s Amiga series used gate arrays for the Gary and Gayle custom chips, as their code names may suggest.

In an attempt to reduce the costs and increase the accessibility of gate array design and production, Ferranti introduced in 1982 a computer-aided design tool for their uncommitted logic array (ULA) product called ULA Designer. Although costing £46,500 to acquire, this tool promised to deliver reduced costs of around £5,000 per design plus manufacturing costs of £1-2 per chip in high volumes, in contrast to the £15,000 design costs incurred by engaging Ferranti&#x27;s services for the design process. Based on a PDP-11/23 minicomputer running RSX/11M, together with graphical display, keyboard, &quot;digitalizing board&quot;, control desk and optional plotter, the solution aimed to satisfy the design needs of gate arrays from 100 to 10,000 gates, with the design being undertaken entirely by the organisation acquiring the solution, starting with a &quot;logic plan&quot;, proceeding through the layout of the logic in the gate array itself, and concluding with the definition of a test specification for verification of the logic and for establishing an automated testing regime. Verification of completed designs was performed by &quot;external specialists&quot; after the transfer of the design to a &quot;CAD center&quot; in Manchester, England or Sunnyvale, California, potentially over the telephone network. Prototyping completed designs took an estimated 3 to 4 weeks. The minicomputer itself was also adaptable to run as a laboratory or office system where appropriate.

Ferranti followed up on the ULA Designer with the Silicon Design System product based on the VAX-11/730 with 1 MB of RAM, 120 MB Winchester disk, and utilising a high-resolution display driven by a graphics unit with 500 KB of its own memory for &quot;high speed windowing, painting, and editing capabilities&quot;. The software itself was available separately for organisations already likely to be using VAX-11/780 systems to provide a multi-user environment, but the &quot;standalone system&quot; package of hardware and software was intended to provide a more affordable solution with a &quot;faster response&quot; during the design process. The suite of tools involved in the use of the product included logic entry and test schedule definition (using Ferranti&#x27;s own description languages), logic simulation, layout definition and checking, and mask generation for prototype gate arrays. The system also sought to support completely auto-routed designs, utilising architectural features of Ferranti&#x27;s auto-routable (AR) arrays to deliver a &quot;100-percent success auto-layout system&quot; with this convenience incurring an increase in silicon area of approximately 25 percent. 

Other British companies developed products for gate array design and fabrication. Qudos Limited, a spin-off from Cambridge University, offered a chip design product called Quickchip available for VAX and MicroVAX II systems and as a complete $11,000 turnkey solution, providing a suite of tools broadly similar to those of Ferranti&#x27;s products including automatic layout, routing, rule checking and simulation functionality for the design of gate arrays. Qudos employed electron beam lithography, etching designs onto Ferranti ULA devices that formed the physical basis of these custom chips. Typical prototype production costs were stated as £100 per chip. Quickchip was subsequently ported to the Acorn Cambridge Workstation, with a low-end version for the BBC Micro, and to the Acorn Archimedes.

=== Alternatives ===
Indirect competition arose with the development of the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Xilinx was founded in 1984, and its first products were much like early gate arrays, slow and expensive, fit only for some niche markets. However, Moore&#x27;s Law quickly made them a force and, by the early 1990s, were seriously disrupting the gate array market.

Designers still wished for a way to create their own complex chips without the expense of full-custom design, and eventually, this wish was granted with the arrival of not only the FPGA, but complex programmable logic device (CPLD), metal configurable standard cells (MCSC), and structured ASICs. Whereas a gate array required a back-end semiconductor wafer foundry to deposit and etch the interconnections, the FPGA and CPLD had user-programmable interconnections. Today&#x27;s approach is to make the prototypes by FPGAs, as the risk is low and the functionality can be verified quickly. For smaller devices, production costs are sufficiently low. But for large FPGAs, production is very expensive, power-hungry, and in many cases, do not reach the required speed. To address these issues, several ASIC companies like BaySand, Faraday, Gigoptics, and others offer FPGA to ASIC conversion services.

=== Decline ===
While the market boomed, profits for the industry were lacking. Semiconductors underwent a series of rolling recessions during the 1980s that created a boom-bust cycle. The 1980 and 1981–1982 general recessions were followed by high-interest rates that curbed capital spending. This reduction played havoc on the semiconductor business, which at the time was highly dependent on capital spending. Manufacturers desperate to keep their fab plants full and afford constant modernization in a fast-moving industry became hyper-competitive. The many new entrants to the market drove gate array prices down to the marginal costs of the silicon manufacturers. Fabless companies such as LSI Logic and CDI survived on selling design services and computer time rather than on production revenues.

As of the early 21st century, the gate array market was a remnant of its former self, driven by the FPGA conversions done for cost or performance reasons. IMI moved out of gate arrays into mixed-signal circuits and was later acquired by Cypress Semiconductor in 2001; CDI closed its doors in 1989; and LSI Logic abandoned the market in favor of standard products and was eventually acquired by Broadcom.

== Design ==

A gate array is a prefabricated silicon chip with most transistors having no predetermined function. These transistors can be connected by metal layers to form standard NAND or NOR logic gates. These logic gates can then be further interconnected into a complete circuit on the same or later metal layers. The creation of a circuit with a specified function is accomplished by adding this final layer or layers of metal interconnects to the chip late in the manufacturing process, allowing the function of the chip to be customized as desired. These layers are analogous to the copper layers of a printed circuit board.

The earliest gate arrays comprised bipolar transistors, usually configured as high-performance transistor–transistor logic, emitter-coupled logic, or current-mode logic logic configurations. CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) gate arrays were later developed and came to dominate the industry.

Gate array master slices with unfinished chips arrayed across a wafer are usually prefabricated and stockpiled in large quantities regardless of customer orders. The design and fabrication according to the individual customer specifications can be finished in a shorter time than standard cell or full custom design. The gate array approach reduces the non-recurring engineering mask costs as fewer custom masks need to be produced. In addition, manufacturing test tooling lead time and costs are reduced — the same test fixtures can be used for all gate array products manufactured on the same die size. Gate arrays were the predecessor of the more complex structured ASIC; unlike gate arrays, structured ASICs tend to include predefined or configurable memories and/or analog blocks.

An application circuit must be built on a gate array that has enough gates, wiring, and I/O pins. Since requirements vary, gate arrays usually come in families, with larger members having more of all resources, but correspondingly more expensive. While the designer can fairly easily count how many gates and I/Os pins are needed, the number of routing tracks needed may vary considerably even among designs with the same amount of logic. (For example, a crossbar switch requires much more routing than a systolic array with the same gate count.) Since unused routing tracks increase the cost (and decrease the performance) of the part without providing any benefit, gate array manufacturers try to provide just enough tracks so that most designs that will fit in terms of gates and I/O pins can be routed. This is determined by estimates such as those derived from Rent&#x27;s rule or by experiments with existing designs.

The main drawbacks of gate arrays are their somewhat lower density and performance compared with other approaches to ASIC design. However, this style is often a viable approach for low production volumes.

== Uses ==

Gate arrays were used widely in the home computers in the early to mid 1980s, including in the ZX81, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron, Advance 86, and Commodore Amiga.

In the 1980s, the Forth Novix N4016 and HP 3000 Series 37 CPUs, both stack machines were implemented by gate arrays as were some graphic terminal functions. Some supporting hardware in at least 1990s DEC and HP servers was implemented by gate arrays.

<doc id="592818" wikidata="Q2142257" url="?curid=592818" title="Infuser">
<text>A tea infuser is a device in which loose, dried tea leaves are placed for steeping or brewing, in a mug or a teapot full of hot water. It is often called a teaball, tea maker or tea egg. The tea infuser gained popularity in the first half of the 19th century. Tea infusers enable one to easily steep tea from fannings and broken leaf teas.

==Use==
A tea infuser performs a similar function as a tea bag, a later American invention. The infuser is generally a small mesh, perforated metal container, or covered spoon that holds tea leaves, in varying sizes, to steep single or multiple servings at once. Common shapes of infusers include spherical, conical and cylindrical. One style of infuser is a split sphere with tong-like handles to open its mesh container.

The infuser is placed in a cup or pot of hot or boiling water, allowing the tea to brew without loose tea leaves spilling into the pot or cup. A rod or chain is may be attached to the container of the infuser to simplify retrieval from the pot or cup. Infusers with large holes may not catch all the leaves, requiring the use of a tea strainer to remove the remaining pieces.

===Alternative use===
====Quick water imbibition====
Water imbibition takes half the time for material that floats with half its area above the water surface when they are submerged with an infuser.

Seeds are often pre-treated before sowing in order to verify that they will sprout. Imbibition of water through the membrane of the seed shell is the first step in the germination process in most seeds. Seeds can be submerged with an infuser, including hot water scarification treatment for tolerant species. Seeds can be weighed with a milligram scale before and after they have been submerged to find out when they don&#x27;t need to be exposed to more water imbibition. Floating seeds can be inspected when they have to sink inside mesh infusers submerged in transparent containers by shaking them. Seeds who don&#x27;t absorb water will not germinate and must be modified with further scarification.

Also, hot water treatment at 90 °C for 90 seconds followed by dip in cold water for 30 seconds can be an effective seed decontamination method against escherichia coli O157:H7 and salmonella.

==Types==

===Ball===
Ball infusers are removed along with the tea leaves from the pot.

====Snap ball====
Snap ball tea strainers are automatically sealed with the force of the end of the handle that is circulated like a spring. The spring handle requires more metal to manufacture, so they are usually a bit more expensive than regular infuser balls.

The handle in snap ball tea strainers make them more practical:
* They can be used as a spoon to swirl solutions that will dissolve their content faster than tea infusers without a handle.
* Air inside a snap ball infuser can easily be eliminated by shaking the handle once it has been put into liquid, to make sure everything inside the ball becomes submerged.

===Shut-off infusers===
Shut-off infusers are left in the pot after the brewing process is complete.

====Alternatives====

=====French press=====
While not common, a French press may be used as a tea infuser. However, most teas are infused only for a limited time and then removed from the water so that the drink does not become bitter.

In &quot;gōngfu chá&quot; (功夫茶), a modern method of infusing tea in China, tea can be infused through a &quot;gàiwǎn&quot; (盖碗), a tea pot (茶壶) or a &quot;gōngdào bēi&quot; (公道杯).

<doc id="592819" wikidata="Q44242" url="?curid=592819" title="Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz">
<text>Río Gallegos () is the capital and largest settlement of the Patagonian province of Santa Cruz in Argentina. Located in the department of Güer Aike, it has a population of about 98,000, according to the , a 24% increase from the 79,000 in the . The city bears the name of the Gallegos River, and sits on its estuary south from the Argentine federal capital Buenos Aires.

Established on 19 December 1885 to increase Argentine power over southern Patagonia, Río Gallegos became the capital of the then Territory of Santa Cruz in 1888, retaining its status when the territory became a province in 1957. Néstor Kirchner, later President of Argentina, served as the city&#x27;s mayor from 1987 to 1991 and is interred in a mausoleum in the city&#x27;s cemetery.

==History==

In 1525 Spanish explorer García Jofre de Loaísa became the first European to reach the Gallegos River, and named it &quot;Río San Idelfonso&quot;. Simón de Alcazaba y Sotomayor&#x27;s 1535 expedition was the first to name the river &quot;Río Gallegos&quot;. The area was not settled by Europeans until much later, with the settlement established 19 December 1885, when the Argentine government wished to better express its sovereignty over southern Patagonia – a naval base was created which increased the development of the town. Between 1912 and 1920, the government encouraged settlers from the Falkland Islands and southern Chile with preferential farming conditions. Some 3,000 arrived and boosted the town. As sheep-farming increased, Río Gallegos became the principal port for exporting sheep and their products. The Pioneers Museum is a preserved old Patagonian house exhibiting the life of the early settlers.

Governor Ramón Lista decided to move the Territorial Capital from Puerto Santa Cruz to Río Gallegos in 1888; official ratification of this decision came on 19 May 1904. The Cathedral of Our Lady of Luján was consecrated in 1900. The Territory of Santa Cruz was declared a Province in 1957, with Mario Cástulo Paradelo as its first Governor.

In the 1982 Falklands War, the city airport was base of Argentine Air Force Mirage III interceptors and A-4 Skyhawks strike aircraft.

Néstor Kirchner, President of Argentina from 2003 to 2007, was mayor of Río Gallegos between 1987 and 1991. His mausoleum is in the city and a street bears his name.

Today, Río Gallegos is an important city of the Argentine far south, with military bases and an international airport. Flights between Chile and Mount Pleasant Airport on the Falkland Islands stop at Río Gallegos once a month.

==Wildlife==

Birds in the area include the thrush, rhea, &quot;chingolo&quot; (rufous-collared sparrow), Chilean flamingo, upland goose and black-necked swan. Grey foxes are predators on the sheep ranched in the city. Other animals found in the area include the guanaco.

On the outskirts of Rio Gallegos there is a wide variety of native plants, including calafates, anartrofilos, oxalis, violets and pansies, paper flowers, calceolarias, hipoqueris, leucerias, perezias, senecios, mata arrears, senecio miser, amancay, lilies, lily of the field.

==Sport==
Rio Gallegos&#x27; main association football club is Boca Rio Gallegos of the Torneo Argentino B, the fourth tier of Argentine football. Founded 12 October 1945 by meat factory workers, the side share their crest and kit with Boca Juniors of Buenos Aires, Argentina&#x27;s most successful club, and have played in the national league system since 1988.
Rio Gallegos&#x27; oldest association football club are Boxing Club founded August 1920 and Hispano Americano founded 17 December 1925 .

==Climate==

Rio Gallegos has a cold steppe climate (&quot;BSk&quot;, under the Köppen climate classification). The climate is dry, windy and cold, with occasional snow during the winter. It is one of the windiest cities on earth, with winds above being commonplace, and over not exceptional. Winter temperatures average during the day and at night, but have dropped as low as . Summers are extremely windy and cloudy, with days reaching a cool and nights dropping to a relatively cold . Cold weather can occur at any time, and despite the very low precipitation, light drizzle and cloudy days are quite common. The highest temperature recorded was on February 5, 2019 while the record low is on July 12, 1982.

<text>Hasdrubal Barca (245– 22June 207BC), a latinization of ʿAzrubaʿal () son of Hamilcar Barca, was a Carthaginian general in the Second Punic War. He was the brother of Hannibal and Mago Barca.

==Youth and Iberian leadership==

Little is known of Hasdrubal&#x27;s early life. He was present, along with his older brother Hannibal, when his father, Hamilcar Barca, died in battle against the Iberians. Hamilcar may have drowned in the Júcar, although the sources do not agree. Little is also known about Hasdrubal&#x27;s activities during the time Hasdrubal the Fair led the Punic forces in Spain, or during the campaigns of Hannibal Barca in Spain and his Siege of Saguntum.

Hannibal left a force of 13,000 infantry, 2,550 cavalry and 21 war elephants in Hispania when he marched for Italy in 218 BC. Hasdrubal commanded this force and he was to set out for Italy in 217 BC to reinforce Hannibal. Hannibal left another army under Hanno in Catalonia, consisting of 10,000 foot and 1,000 horse, on his way to Italy in 218 BC. Hasdrubal was destined to fight for the next six years against the brothers Gnaeus and Publius Cornelius Scipio commanding an army which initially numbered 4 legions (8,000 Roman and 14,000 allied infantry, 600 Roman and 1,600 allied horse) along with 60 quinqueremes. The Punic navy had a fleet of 50 quinqueremes and 5 triremes stationed in Spain, however, only 32 Quinqueremes were manned at the start of the Second Punic War.

The expedition led by Gnaeus Scipio in 218 BC had caught the Carthaginians by surprise, and before Hasdrubal could join Hanno in Catalonia, the Carthaginian commander on the north of the Ebro, the Romans had fought and won the Battle of Cissa and established their army at Tarraco and their fleet at Emporiae. Hasdrubal, commanding only 8,000 troops and outnumbered by the Romans, raided the Romans with a flying column of light infantry and cavalry, which inflicted severe losses on their naval crews and reduced the fighting strength to 35 ships. This loss was offset by the arrival of an allied Greek contingent from the city of Massilia.

In the spring of 217 BC, Hasdrubal led a joint expedition north to fight the Romans. He commanded the army, while his deputy Himilco commanded the fleet. The Punic Army and the fleet moved north side by side and encamped on the mouth of the Ebro River. Carelessness of the Carthaginian fleet enabled Gnaeus Scipio to surprise the Carthaginians and crush their naval contingent at the Battle of Ebro River. Hasdrubal was obliged to march back to Cartagena, fearing seaborne attacks on Carthaginian territories. With the Iberian contingent of the Carthaginian navy shattered, Hasdrubal was forced to either call Carthage for reinforcements or build new ships. He did neither.

The performance of the Iberian crews had been poor in the battle, and their dismissal sparked a rebellion in the Turdetani tribe. Hasdrubal would spend all of 216 BC subduing the rebels around the area near Gades. Hasdrubal received orders from Carthage to move into Italy and join up with Hannibal in order to put pressure on the Romans in their homeland, but Hasdrubal delayed, arguing that Carthaginian authority over the Iberian tribes was too fragile and the Roman forces in the area too strong for him to execute the planned movement. Hasdrubal was reinforced by 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry and was ordered by the Carthaginian senate to march to Italy in the same year, and he spent 216 BC crushing the Iberian rebels near Gades.

Hannibal Barca had defeated the Romans at the Battle of Cannae in August of 216 BC, resulting in the defection of most of South Italy, and in the north the Gauls had wiped out 25,000 Roman and Italian soldiers in the Battle of Silva Litana, putting Rome on the defensive in North Italy. Hannibal had sent his youngest brother, Mago, who had marched into Italy with him in 218 BC, to Carthage to gather reinforcements. Carthaginian Senate had authorized sending 4,000 Numidian cavalry and 40 Elephants and 500 talents to Hannibal and Mago was given the authority to raise additional 20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, and he had raised an army of 12,000 infantry, 1500 cavalry and 20 war elephants, by the spring of 215 BC, which was meant to land at Locri in Italy. Carthage had sent an army and fleet under Himilco to guard Iberia in 216 BC, leaving Hasdrubal free to invade North Italy, catching the Romans in a strategic pincer movement in Central Italy.

Hasdrubal left Cartagena in the spring of 215 BC and marched for the Ebro, besieged a pro-Roman town and offered battle at Ibera. In this battle, Hasdrubal used his cavalry superiority to attempt to clear the field while attempting to envelop the enemy on both sides with his infantry. However, the Romans broke through the thinned-out center of the Carthaginian line and then defeated each wing separately, inflicting severe losses, and taking heavy losses themselves.

The Scipios&#x27; victory ensured Hasdrubal&#x27;s failure to reinforce Hannibal overland when the Carthaginians held the upper hand in Italy, and also robbed Hannibal of anticipated seaborne reinforcements and further weakened the Carthaginian hold on the Iberian tribes. Mago and his army were diverted to Iberia after the Carthaginian defeat at Ibera. The classicist Howard Scullard is of the opinion that the Roman victory prevented them from being expelled from Iberia, not least because the Iberian tribes would have abandoned Rome; and from Hasdrubal promptly marching at full strength to reinforce Hannibal in Italy, where &quot;Rome could hardly withstand the double force.&quot; Klaus Zimmermann agrees: &quot;the Scipios&#x27; victory ... may well have been the decisive battle of the war&quot; The Carthaginians from then on were forced to contest the Romans in the area between the Ebro and Jucar.

==Joint command==

This defeat also led to Mago and Hasdrubal Gisco arriving in Iberia with two armies and ending the undisputed command of the Barcid family in Iberia. The Carthaginians fought the Scipio brothers and had on the whole the worst of the conflict between 215 and 212 BC, but managed to prevent the loss of any territory. According to Livy, the Romans fought multiple battles against the Carthaginians south of the Ebro from 215 to 214 BC, at Iliturgi, Munda, and Orongi. Livy&#x27;s chronology is confused and contradicted by Polybius, who explicitly states that the Scipio brothers did not venture south of the Ebro until 212 BC. As a result, most historians consider these engagements to be ahistorical.

At the instigation of the Romans, Syphax, one of the kings of the Numidian tribes, attacked Carthaginian territories in Africa in 213/212 BC. The situation in Iberia was sufficiently under control, because Hasdrubal and his Iberian army crossed over to Africa and crushed the threat of Syphax in a battle where 30,000 Numidians were killed. With his Roman-trained army shattered, Syphax fled to Mauritania. The aid of Masinissa, a Numidian prince, was invaluable during this episode, and he crossed over to Iberia with Hasdrubal after the African expedition ended with 3,000 Numidian cavalry.

The Roman commanders captured Saguntum in 212BC and in 211BC hired 20,000 Celtiberian mercenaries to reinforce their army. Observing that the three Carthaginian armies were deployed apart from each other, the Romans split their forces and invaded Carthaginian territory with the aim of defeating the Carthaginian forces in detail. However, In late 212 BC, Hasdrubal, with timely cooperation from Mago Barca and Hasdrubal Gisco, completely routed his opponents at the Battle of the Upper Baetis, destroying the majority of the Roman army in Iberia and killing both the Scipios. Carthaginians gained control of Iberia up to the Ebro as a result of this victory. However, the lack of cooperation between the Carthaginian generals led to the surviving Roman force of 8,000 retiring safely to the north of the river Ebro. These troops somehow managed to keep the Carthaginian armies from gaining a foothold north of the Ebro and resist all Carthaginians efforts to expel them. The Romans reinforced this detachment with 10,000 troops under Claudius Nero in 211 BC to stabilize the situation, and with another 10,000 soldiers under Scipio Africanus Major in 210 BC, who spent the year training his army and improving his diplomatic contacts.

==Second Carthaginian expedition to Italy==

The Carthaginian armies had dispersed into the interior of Iberia in 209 BC, possibly to maintain control over the Iberian tribes, which they were dependent on for soldiers and provisions. The Carthaginian armies were subsequently outgeneraled by Scipio Africanus Major, who, taking advantage of the absence of the three Carthaginian armies in 209 BC, captured Carthago Nova and gained other advantages. Hasdrubal was defeated by Scipio at the Battle of Baecula but managed to retreat with two-thirds of his army intact.

Later in 208 BC, Hasdrubal was summoned to join his brother in Italy. He eluded Scipio by crossing the Pyrenees at their western extremity and safely made his way into Gaul in the winter of 208. Scipio&#x27;s failure to stop Hasdrubal&#x27;s march to Italy was criticized by the Roman Senate. Scipio did not exploit his victory at Baecula to drive out the Carthaginians from Iberia, instead choosing to withdraw to his base at Tarraco. He secured alliances with many of the Iberian tribes, who switched sides after the Roman successes at Carthago Nova and Baecula. Hasdrubal waited until the spring of 207 to make his way through the Alps and into Northern Italy. Hasdrubal made much faster progress than his brother had, partly due to the construction left behind by Hannibal&#x27;s army when he had passed via the same route a decade earlier, but also due to the removal of the Gallic threat that had plagued Hannibal early on. The Gauls now feared and respected the Carthaginians, and not only was Hasdrubal allowed to pass through the Alps unmolested, his ranks were bolstered by many enthusiastic Gauls. Hasdrubal, in the same fashion as his brother, succeeded in bringing his war elephants, raised and trained in Hispania.

It was not until Hasdrubal sent messengers to Hannibal that decisive measures were taken. Hasdrubal wished to meet with his brother in South Umbria. However, this was not to be. Hasdrubal&#x27;s messengers were captured, and he was ultimately checked by two Roman armies. Being forced to give battle, he was decisively defeated at the Battle of the Metaurus. Hasdrubal, with his armies defeated and in full disorganized retreat, charged into the fray to his certain death, and was beheaded. His head was packed into a sack and thrown into his brother Hannibal&#x27;s camp as a sign of his utter defeat. This action was in stark contrast to Hannibal&#x27;s treatment of the bodies of fallen Roman Consuls.

The significance of the Battle of the Metaurus is recognized amongst historians. It is included in Edward Shepherd Creasy&#x27;s &quot;The Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World&quot; (1851), the rationale being that it effectively removed the Carthaginian threat from Rome&#x27;s ascendancy to global dominion by leaving Hannibal stranded in Italy. Paul K. Davis sees its importance as the &quot;Carthaginian defeat ended the attempt to reinforce Hannibal, dooming his effort in Italy, and Rome was able to establish dominance over Spain.&quot;

<doc id="592828" wikidata="Q7440323" url="?curid=592828" title="Seafair">
<text>Seafair is an annual summer festival in Seattle, Washington, that encompasses a wide variety of small neighborhood events leading up to several major citywide celebrations. Its main events include the Torchlight Parade (and accompanying Torchlight Run), Seafair Cup hydroplane races, and an air show that often features the Blue Angels. Seafair also encompasses smaller block parties and local parades around the city and Seattle metropolitan area.

Seafair has been an annual event in Seattle since 1950 but its roots can be traced to the 1911 Seattle Golden Potlatch Celebrations.

==History==

The 2020 schedule for Seafair was cancelled on May 20, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on public gatherings. The next edition of Seafair was also cancelled in April 2021, stating that &quot;while encouraged by Governor Inslee&#x27;s Phase 3 guidelines that support small and medium size events to return with limitations, Seafair leadership recognizes the guidelines will not support events the scale of a city-wide festival.&quot;

==Events==
Seafair begins in mid-June; since 1949, its arrival has been heralded by the Seafair Pirates Landing on Alki Beach, and the Milk Carton Derby on Green Lake, a whimsical boat race in which all the boats have been constructed out of empty milk cartons. Entries always range from those carefully shaped for speed and stability to those designed for maximum amusement. The Derby is usually associated with a variety of activities for children and families on the shores of Green Lake.

A half marathon was added in 2002, follow three years later by the full Seafair Marathon. Participants can run or walk the and courses. If a shorter distance is more appealing, participants can run or walk a 5 km course. The 2008 Seafair Half Marathon and Seafair Marathon began at Husky Stadium, crossed the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, and ended at Bellevue, Washington&#x27;s Bellevue Downtown Park. After the race, live music was performed. In 2009, the Seafair Marathon and Half Marathon were replaced with the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Seattle Marathon and Half Marathon.

In 2013, an Independence Day fireworks show at Lake Union known as the Seafair Summer Fourth was added. The event serves as a &quot;de facto&quot; successor to the &quot;Family Fourth&quot; fireworks event formerly held at the same site, which had been discontinued by its organizers due to a lack of funding. The event was revived under the auspices of Seafair with the financial support of local sponsors.

The Seafair Triathlon is held on the shores of Lake Washington from Seward Park. It features both Sprint - half-mile swim, bike ride, and 5 km run - and Olympic distances. Participants can compete individually or as a team. Typically, the Seafair Triathlon is held the third weekend of July. In 2007, the Seafair Triathlon saw a record turnout of 2,200.

===The Torchlight festivities===

The last weekend in July belongs to the Torchlight Parade and Torchlight Run. Many local organizations participate in these events, held on the streets of Downtown Seattle. The local woman who has been selected as &quot;Miss Seafair&quot; (prior to 1972, &quot;Seafair Queen&quot;) plays a prominent role in the parade. It is traditionally preceded by the Torchlight Run, a short (8 km) race through the city&#x27;s streets in which many participants run in costume.

===Seafair Weekend===
One of the most popular events of the festival is the Seafair Weekend, held traditionally the first weekend of August on Genesee Park. Seafair Weekend main events include hydroplane racing on the water and aerobatics show in the sky.

The Seafair Cup is an American Boat Racing Association unlimited hydroplane racing circuit stop at Stan Sayres Memorial Park on Lake Washington, in the Seward Park neighborhood. The races attract tens of thousands of spectators, both those standing on the public shores of the lake, and those in boats anchored just outside the course in the lake itself.

A tradition started in 1972, the Seafair Air Show is an aerobatics show coincidently with the days of the Seafair Cup. World-class aerobatics teams perform their aerial stunts over Lake Washington, most prominently the US Navy Blue Angels and US Army Golden Knights. Notoriously, the Blue Angels have been attending the Air Show annually since its first edition, excepting in three occasions. The aerobatics show is a slightly controversial part of Seafair, as some local residents fear an accident involving the low-flying aircraft, and some find the noise of the jet engines irritating. There was no show at Seafair in 1994 and 1995 as a result of a dispute with the FAA about whether they could safely fly over Lake Washington. In 1996 the Blue Angels flew over Elliott Bay, west of downtown Seattle, in a separate event from the hydroplane race, but this was a financial flop, and they returned to being part of the race-weekend festivities over Lake Washington in 1997. Due to government budget cuts, the Blue Angels did not perform at Seafair 2013; they were replaced by the Patriots Jet Team. From 2019, the aerobatics show fly-over area was moved south to avoid the closing of the floating bridges carrying Interstate 90 between Mercer Island and Seattle during the three days of Seafair Weekend.

===Seafair Pirates===

Another aspect of Seafair is the involvement of the Seafair Pirates, an organization that works year-round entertaining children in hospitals and performing other acts of community service including extensive fundraising. However, the pirates also usually perform loud—occasionally offensive—antics at Seafair (in an attempt to live up to their name) that cause perennial objection to their prominent involvement in the festivities. Despite this reputation, most people who enjoy Seafair see them as an essential part of the event.

<text>Before humans went into space in the 1960s, several other animals were launched into space, including numerous other primates, so that scientists could investigate the biological effects of spaceflight. The United States launched flights containing primate passengers primarily between 1948 and 1961 with one flight in 1969 and one in 1985. France launched two monkey-carrying flights in 1967. The Soviet Union and Russia launched monkeys between 1983 and 1996. Most primates were anesthetized before lift-off.

Over thirty-two non-human primates flew in the space program; none flew more than once. Numerous backup primates also went through the programs but never flew. Monkeys and non-human apes from several species were used, including rhesus macaque, crab-eating macaque, squirrel monkeys, pig-tailed macaques, and chimpanzees.

==United States==

The first primate launched into high subspace, although not a space flight, was Albert I, a rhesus macaque, who on June 18, 1948, rode a rocket flight to over in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on a V-2 rocket. Albert I died of suffocation during the flight and may actually have died in the cramped space capsule before launch.

On June 14, 1949, Albert II survived a sub-orbital V-2 flight into space (but died on impact after a parachute failure) to become the first monkey, first primate, and first mammal in space. His flight reached – past the Kármán line of 100 km which designates the beginning of space. 

On September 16, 1949, Albert III died below the Kármán line, at 35,000 feet (10.7 km), in an explosion of his V2. On December 8, Albert IV, the second mammal in space, flew on the last monkey V-2 flight and died on impact after another parachute failure after reaching 130.6 km. Alberts, I, II, and IV were rhesus macaques while Albert III was a crab-eating macaque.

Monkeys later flew on Aerobee rockets. On April 18, 1951, a monkey, possibly called Albert V, died due to parachute failure. Yorick, also called Albert VI, along with 11 mouse crewmates, reached 236,000 ft (72 km, 44.7 mi) and survived the landing, on September 20, 1951, the first monkey to do so (the dogs Dezik and Tsygan had survived a trip to space in July of that year), although he died two hours later. Two of the mice also died after recovery; all of the deaths were thought to be related to stress from overheating in the sealed capsule in the New Mexico sun while awaiting the recovery team. Albert VI&#x27;s flight surpassed the 50-mile boundary the U.S. used for spaceflight but was below the international definition of space. Patricia and Mike, two cynomolgus monkeys, flew on May 21, 1952, and survived, but their flight was only to 26 kilometers.

On December 13, 1958, Gordo, also called Old Reliable, a squirrel monkey, survived being launched aboard Jupiter AM-13 by the US Army. After flying for over 1,500 miles and reaching a height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth, Gordo landed in the South Atlantic and was killed due to mechanical failure of the parachute recovery system in the rocket nose cone.

On May 28, 1959, aboard the JUPITER AM-18, Miss Able, a rhesus macaque, and Miss Baker, a squirrel monkey from Peru, flew a successful mission. Able was born at the Ralph Mitchell Zoo in Independence, Kansas. They traveled in excess of 16,000 km/h, and withstood 38 &quot;g&quot; (373 m/s2). Able died June 1, 1959, while undergoing surgery to remove an infected medical electrode, from a reaction to the anesthesia. Baker became the first monkey to survive the stresses of spaceflight and the related medical procedures. Baker died November 29, 1984, at the age of 27 and is buried on the grounds of the United States Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Able was preserved, and is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum. Their names were taken from the 1943–1955 US military phonetic alphabet.

On December 4, 1959, from Wallops Island, Virginia, Sam, a rhesus macaque, flew on the Little Joe 2 in the Mercury program to 53 miles high. On January 21, 1960, Miss Sam, also a rhesus macaque, followed, on Little Joe 1B although her flight was only to in a test of emergency procedures. 

Chimpanzees Ham and Enos also flew in the Mercury program, with Ham becoming the first great ape or Hominidae in space. The names &quot;Sam&quot; and &quot;Ham&quot; were acronyms. Sam was named in homage to the School of Aerospace Medicine at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, and the name &quot;Ham&quot; was taken from Holloman Aerospace Medicine at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Ham and Enos were among 60 chimpanzees brought to New Mexico by the U.S. Air Force for space flight tests. Six were selected to be trained at Cape Canaveral by Tony Gentry et al.

Goliath, a squirrel monkey, died in the explosion of his Atlas rocket on November 10, 1961. A rhesus macaque called Scatback flew a sub-orbital flight on December 20, 1961, but was lost at sea after landing.

Bonny, a pig-tailed macaque, flew on Biosatellite 3, a mission which lasted from June 29 to July 8, 1969. This was the first multi-day monkey flight but came after longer human spaceflights were common. He died within a day of landing.

Spacelab 3 on the Space Shuttle flight STS-51-B featured two squirrel monkeys named No. 3165 and No. 384-80. The flight was from April 29 to May 6, 1985.

==France==
France launched a pig-tailed macaque named Martine on a Vesta rocket on March 7, 1967, and another named Pierrette on March 13. These suborbital flights reached and , respectively. Martine became the first monkey to survive more than a couple of hours after flying above the international definition of the edge of space (Ham and Enos, launched earlier by the United States, were chimpanzees).

==Soviet Union and Russia==
The Soviet /Russian space program used only rhesus macaques in its Bion satellite program in 1980s and 1990s. The names of the monkeys began with sequential letters of the Russian alphabet (А, Б, В, Г, Д, Е, Ё, Ж, З...). The animals all survived their missions but for a single fatality in post-flight surgery, after which the program was canceled.

#The first monkeys launched by Soviet space program, Abrek and Bion, flew on Bion 6. They remained aloft from December 14, 1983 – December 20, 1983.
#Next came Bion 7 with monkeys Verny and Gordy from July 10, 1985 – July 17, 1985.
#Then Dryoma and Yerosha on Bion 8 from September 29, 1987 – October 12, 1987. After returning from space Dryoma was presented to Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
#Bion 9 with monkeys Zhakonya and Zabiyaka followed from September 15, 1989, to September 28, 1989. The two took the space endurance record for monkeys at 13 days, 17 hours in space.
#Monkeys Ivasha and Krosh flew on Bion 10 from December 29, 1992, to January 7, 1993. Krosh produced offspring, after rehabilitation upon returning to Earth.
#Lapik and Multik were the last monkeys in space until Iran launched one of its own in 2013. The pair flew aboard Bion 11 from December 24, 1996, to January 7, 1997. Upon return, Multik died while under anesthesia for US biopsy sampling on January 8. Lapik nearly died while undergoing the identical procedure. No follow-up research has been conducted to determine whether these two incidents, together with the 1959 loss of the US monkey Able in post-flight surgery, contraindicate the administration of anesthesia during or shortly after spaceflights. Further US support of the Bion program was canceled.

On December 23, 1969 in Chamical, La Rioja, as part of the &#x27;Operación Navidad&#x27; (Operation Christmas), Argentina launched Juan (a tufted capuchin, native to Argentina&#x27;s Misiones Province) using a two-stage Rigel 04 rocket. It ascended perhaps up to 82 kilometers and then was recovered successfully. Other sources give 30, 60 or 72 kilometers. All of these are below the international definition of space (100 km). Later, on February 1, 1970, the experience was repeated with a female monkey of the same species using an X-1 Panther rocket. Although it reached a higher altitude than its predecessor, it was lost after the capsule&#x27;s parachute failed.

==China==
The PRC spacecraft Shenzhou 2 launched on January 9, 2001. It is rumored that inside the reentry module (precise information is lacking due to the secrecy surrounding China&#x27;s space program) a monkey, dog, and rabbit rode aloft in a test of the spacecraft&#x27;s life support systems. The SZ2 reentry module landed in Inner Mongolia on January 16. No images of the recovered capsule appeared in the press, leading to the widespread inference that the flight ended in failure. According to press reports citing an unnamed source, a parachute connection malfunction caused a hard landing.

==Iran==
On January 28, 2013, AFP and Sky News reported that Iran had sent a monkey in a &quot;Pishgam&quot; rocket to a height of and retrieved &quot;shipment&quot;. Iranian media gave no details on the timing or location of the launch, while details that were reported raised questions about the claim. Pre-flight and post-flight photos clearly showed different monkeys. The confusion was due to the publishing of an archive photo from 2011 by the Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA). According to Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer, &quot;They just mixed that footage with the footage of the 2013 successful launch.&quot;

On December 14, 2013, AFP and BBC reported that Iran again sent a monkey to space and safely returned it. Rhesus macaques Aftab (2013.01.28) and Fargam (2013.12.14) were each launched separately into space and safely returned. Researchers continue to study the effects of the space trip on their offspring.

== In popular culture ==
The 2014 animated series &quot;All Hail King Julien: Exiled&quot; features a horde of highly intelligent chimpanzee cosmonauts, whom they claim the USSR abandoned on a Madagascar islet following the end of the Space Race. Although faithful to &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, the chimpanzees vow to take revenge on humankind for declaring their obsolescence.

<text>Vincent Millie Youmans (September 27, 1898 – April 5, 1946) was an American Broadway composer and producer.

A leading Broadway composer of his day, Youmans collaborated with virtually all the greatest lyricists on Broadway: Ira Gershwin, Otto Harbach, Oscar Hammerstein II, Irving Caesar, Anne Caldwell, Leo Robin, Howard Dietz, Clifford Grey, Billy Rose, Edward Eliscu, Edward Heyman, Harold Adamson, Buddy DeSylva and Gus Kahn. Youmans&#x27; early songs are remarkable for their economy of melodic material: two-, three- or four-note phrases are constantly repeated and varied by subtle harmonic or rhythmic changes. In later years, however, he turned to longer musical sentences and more rhapsodic melodic lines. Youmans published fewer than 100 songs, but 18 of these were considered standards by ASCAP, a remarkably high percentage.

==Biography==
Youmans was born in New York City, United States, into a prosperous family of hat makers. When he was two, his father moved the family to upper-class Larchmont, New York. Youmans attended the Trinity School in Mamaroneck, New York, and Heathcote Hall in Rye, New York. His ambition was initially to become an engineer, and he attended Yale University for a short time. He dropped out to become a runner for a Wall Street brokerage firm, but was soon drafted in the Navy during World War I, although he saw no combat. While stationed in Illinois, he took an interest in the theater and began producing troop shows for the Navy.

After the war, Youmans was a Tin Pan Alley song-plugger for Jerome H. Remick Music Publishers, and then a rehearsal pianist for composer Victor Herbert’s operettas. In 1921, he collaborated with lyricist Ira Gershwin on the score for &quot;Two Little Girls in Blue&quot;, which brought him his first Broadway composing credit, and his first hit song &quot;Oh Me! Oh My!&quot;, and a contract with T. B. Harms. His next show was &quot;Wildflower&quot; (1923), with lyrics by Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein II, which was a major success. His most enduring success was &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, with lyrics by Irving Caesar, which reached Broadway in 1925 after an unprecedented try-out in Chicago and subsequent national and international tours. &quot;No, No Nanette&quot; was the biggest musical-comedy success of the 1920s in both Europe and the US and his two songs &quot;Tea for Two&quot; and &quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot; were worldwide hits. Both songs are considered standards. &quot;Tea For Two&quot; was consistently ranked among the most recorded popular songs for decades.

In 1927, Youmans began producing his own Broadway shows. He also left his publisher TB Harms Company and began publishing his own songs. He had a major success with &quot;Hit the Deck!&quot; (1927), which included the hit songs &quot;Sometimes I&#x27;m Happy&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. His subsequent productions after 1927 were failures, despite the song hits they featured (&quot;Great Day and &quot;Without a Song&quot; from &quot;Great Day&quot; (1929), &quot;Time On My Hands&quot; from &quot;Smiles&quot; (1930), and the title song from &quot;Through the Years&quot;). His last contributions to Broadway were additional songs for &quot;Take a Chance&quot; (1932).

In 1933, Youmans wrote the songs for &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;, the first film to feature Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers as a featured dancing pair. His score contained &quot;Orchids in the Moonlight&quot;, &quot;The Carioca&quot;, &quot;Music Makes Me&quot;, and the title song. The film was a tremendous hit, and it revived the composer&#x27;s professional prospects, though he never again wrote for Astaire/Rogers.

After a professional career of only 13 years, Youmans was forced into retirement in 1934 after contracting tuberculosis. He spent the remainder of his life battling the disease. His only return to Broadway was to mount an ill-fated extravaganza entitled &quot;Vincent Youmans&#x27; Ballet Revue&quot; (1943), an ambitious mix of Latin-American and classical music, including Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;. Choreographed by Leonide Massine. The production lost some $4 million.

==Private life==
Youmans married chorus girl Anne Varley on February 7, 1927. Their twins, Vincent Jr. and Cecily, were born on August 16, 1927.

Anne filed for divorce just five days after the birth of her children. During the subsequent legal battle, Vincent denied fathering his two children. In May 1933, Vincent&#x27;s apartment in New York City was broken into by two private detectives hired by Anne. They found extensive evidence of Vincent&#x27;s adultery. Vincent stopped contesting the divorce, and it was granted on November 25, 1933.

Vincent Youmans was an alcoholic and a member of the Lost Generation. He was a lifelong heavy drinker and partier and well-known for womanizing. The drinking impaired his health, and he contracted tuberculosis in 1932. It went into remission for two years, but recurred in 1934.

Youmans married chorus girl Mildred Boots on October 22, 1935. She filed for divorce, citing grounds of &quot;mental cruelty&quot;, in Reno, Nevada, on January 19, 1946. It was granted two days later after Youmans did not contest it.

==Death and legacy==
Youmans died of tuberculosis on April 5, 1946, at a hotel in Denver, Colorado. Mary Chase, author of the 1944 Broadway play &quot;Harvey&quot;, was at his beside.

At the time of his death, Youmans left behind a large quantity of unpublished material. In 1970, Youmans was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 1971, &quot;No, No Nanette&quot; enjoyed a notable Broadway revival starring Ruby Keeler, and choreographed by Busby Berkeley, which was widely credited with beginning the nostalgia era on Broadway. In 1983, he was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

<text>Gertrude Lawrence (4 July 1898 – 6 September 1952) was an English actress, singer, dancer and musical comedy performer known for her stage appearances in the West End of London and on Broadway in New York.

==Early life==
Lawrence was born in 1898 in Newington, London of English and Danish descent. Her name at birth was registered as Gertrude Alice Dagmar Klasen. Other variants of her birth name include Alexandra Dagmar Lawrence-Klasen, and Gertrude Alexandra Dagmar Klasen.

Her father was a basso profondo who performed under the name Arthur Lawrence. His heavy drinking led her mother Alice to leave him soon after Gertrude&#x27;s birth.
In 1904, her stepfather took the family to Bognor on the Sussex coast for the August bank holiday. While there, they attended a concert where audience members were invited to entertain. At her mother&#x27;s urging, young Gertrude sang a song and was rewarded with a gold sovereign for her effort. It was her first public performance.

In 1908, to augment the family&#x27;s meagre income, Alice accepted a job in the chorus of the Christmas pantomime at Brixton Theatre. A child who could sing and dance was needed to round out the troupe, and Alice volunteered her daughter. While working in the production Alice heard of Italia Conti, who taught dance, elocution and the rudiments of acting. Gertrude auditioned for Conti, who thought the child was talented enough to warrant free lessons.

She joined Italia Conti&#x27;s production of &quot;Where the Rainbow Ends;&quot; (Conti&#x27;s training of the cast would lead her to form the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in 1911.) Conti&#x27;s training led to Lawrence&#x27;s appearance in Max Reinhardt&#x27;s &quot;The Miracle&quot; staged in London and &quot;Fifinella&quot;, directed by Basil Dean, for the Liverpool Repertory Theatre. At some point during this period, the child decided to adopt her father&#x27;s professional surname as her own. Dean then cast her in his next production, Gerhart Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;Hannele&quot;, where she first met Noël Coward. Their meeting was the start of a close and sometimes tempestuous friendship and arguably the most important professional relationship in both their lives.

==Early stage career==
Following &quot;Hannele&quot;, Lawrence reconnected with her father, who was living with a chorus girl. They agreed to let her tour with them in two successive revues, after which Arthur announced he had signed a year-long contract with a variety show in South Africa, leaving the two young women to fend for themselves. Lawrence, now aged sixteen, opted to live at the Theatrical Girls&#x27; Club in Soho rather than return to her mother and stepfather.

She worked steadily with various touring companies until 1916, when she was hired by impresario André Charlot to understudy Beatrice Lillie and appear in the chorus of his latest production in London&#x27;s West End. When it closed, she assumed Lillie&#x27;s role on tour, then returned to London once again to understudy the star in another Charlot production, where she met dance director Francis Gordon-Howley. Although he was twenty years her senior, the two wed and soon after had a daughter Pamela, born on 28 May 1918, who was Lawrence&#x27;s only child. The marriage was not a success, and Lawrence took Pamela with her to her mother&#x27;s home in Clapham. The couple remained separated but did not divorce until ten years later.

In 1918, either during Lawrence&#x27;s pregnancy or shortly after she gave birth, she contracted lumbago. Charlot gave her two weeks to recuperate. He saw Lawrence at an opening night party at Ivor Novello&#x27;s invitation two days before she was cleared to return to work by her doctor. Charlot immediately fired her. When the apparent reason for her dismissal became common knowledge among other West End theatrical producers, she was allegedly unable to find work, according to some sources. (The veracity of this information is put in doubt by a theater program for the opening performance of Charlot&#x27;s revue &quot;Buzz Buzz&quot; on 20 December 1918, which clearly shows that Lawrence was in the cast at that time, and there is no evidence that she could have left the cast during its 613-performance run that ended on 13 March 1920.)

In early 1919, Lawrence accepted a job singing at Murray&#x27;s, a popular London nightclub, where she remained for the better part of the next two years. While performing there she met Captain Philip Astley, a member of the Household Cavalry. He became her friend, escort, and ultimately lover, and taught her how to dress and behave in high society.

At the end of 1920, Lawrence left Murray&#x27;s and began to ease her way back into the legitimate theater while touring in a music hall act as the partner of popular singer Walter Williams. In October 1921, Charlot asked her to replace an ailing Beatrice Lillie as star of his latest production, &quot;A to Z&quot;, opposite Jack Buchanan. In it the two introduced the song &quot;Limehouse Blues,&quot; which went on to become one of Lawrence&#x27;s signature tunes.

In 1923, Noël Coward developed his first musical revue, &quot;London Calling!&quot;, specifically for Lawrence. Charlot agreed to produce it, but brought in more experienced writers and composers to work on the book and score. One of Coward&#x27;s surviving songs was &quot;Parisian Pierrot&quot;, a tune that would be identified closely with Lawrence throughout her career.

The show&#x27;s success led its producer to create &quot;André Charlot&#x27;s London Revue of 1924&quot;, which he took to Broadway with Lawrence, Lillie, Jack Buchanan and Constance Carpenter. It was so successful it moved to a larger Broadway theater to accommodate the demand for tickets, extending its run. After it closed, the show toured the United States and Canada, although Lawrence was forced to leave the cast when she contracted double pneumonia and pleurisy and was forced to spend fourteen weeks in a Toronto hospital recuperating.

&quot;Charlot&#x27;s Revue of 1926&quot;, starring Lawrence, Lillie, and Jack Buchanan, opened on Broadway in late 1925. In his review, Alexander Woollcott singled out Lawrence, calling her &quot;the personification of style and sophistication&quot; and &quot;the ideal star.&quot; Like its predecessor, it toured following the Broadway run. It proved to be Lawrence&#x27;s last project with Charlot. In November 1926, she became the first British performer to star in an American musical on Broadway when she opened in &quot;Oh, Kay!&quot;, with music by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin, and a book by Guy Bolton and P.G. Wodehouse. Following a run of 256 performances, the musical opened in London’s West End, where it ran for 213 performances.
When Lawrence became romantically involved with Wall Street banker Bert Taylor in 1927, Philip Astley proposed marriage, an offer Lawrence refused because she knew Astley would expect her to leave the stage and settle in rural England. The two remained close until he married actress Madeleine Carroll in 1931. When Lawrence divorced Francis Gordon-Howley, she and Taylor became engaged and remained so for two years, with each free to enjoy a social life separate from the other.
In 1928, Lawrence returned to Broadway opposite Clifton Webb in &quot;Treasure Girl&quot;, a Gershwin work she was confident would be a huge hit. Anticipating a long run, she arrived in New York with her daughter Pamela, a personal maid and two cars, and settled into a flat on Park Avenue. Her instincts about the musical were wrong; audiences had difficulty accepting her as an avaricious woman who double-crosses her lover, and it ran for only 68 performances. She starred opposite Leslie Howard in &quot;Candle Light&quot;, an Austrian play adapted by Wodehouse, in 1929, and in 1930-31 she and Noël Coward triumphed in his play &quot;Private Lives&quot;, first in the UK, and later on Broadway. In 1930, Johnny Green composed his most famous song &quot;Body and Soul&quot; especially for Gertrude Lawrence.

While working in Manhattan, Lawrence started studying with vocal coach Estelle Liebling to prepare for her performances on the Broadway stage. Lawrence continued to study with Liebling for many years.

==Later stage career==
In 1936, Lawrence and Coward starred in &quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot;, a cycle of ten one-act plays he had written specifically for the two of them. In 1937, she appeared in the Rachel Crothers drama &quot;Susan and God&quot;; NBC televised a performance of some scenes, with Lawrence and the Broadway cast using duplicate stage sets in its studios.

Lawrence also starred in 1939&#x27;s &quot;Skylark&quot;, a comedy by Samson Raphaelson. Lawrence felt the play needed work prior to opening on Broadway, and a run at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts was arranged. The theatre was run by Broadway producer Richard Aldrich, and he and the actress became involved in a romantic relationship. The two wed on her birthday in 1940 and remained married until her death in 1952. They had homes in Dennis and in Turtle Bay, Manhattan.

In June 1941, Lawrence&#x27;s daughter Pamela married a New York doctor named William G. Cahan. The ceremony was held at the Dennis, Massachusetts home of Lawrence and Aldrich. Lawrence was friendly with her son-in-law but lost contact with him after his 1950 divorce from Pamela, according to Cahan&#x27;s memoir that was published in 1992. Lawrence did not have any grandchildren during her lifetime.

Lawrence returned to the musical stage in &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; in 1941. It originally had been planned as a play with recurrent musical themes for Katharine Cornell by Moss Hart, Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin, but by the time the first act was completed it was clear it was very much a musical that Cornell agreed was beyond her capability as a performer. Soon after this, Hart met Lawrence at a rehearsal for a revue designed to raise funds for British War Relief, and he offered her the role of Liza Elliott, a magazine editor undergoing psychoanalysis to better understand why both her professional and personal lives are filled with indecision.

The show was very ambitious and stretched the star&#x27;s talents for singing, dancing and acting. Her performance prompted Richard Watts of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; to call her &quot;the greatest feminine performer in the American theatre,&quot; and Brooks Atkinson described her as &quot;a goddess&quot; in his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She remained with the show throughout its Broadway run and its subsequent national tour over the next three years.

Decades later, Ira Gershwin told American songwriting historian Sheila Davis about a contribution Lawrence made to honing the lyrics of the song &quot;My Ship&quot; in &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;. &quot;During a &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; rehearsal,&quot; Davis wrote, &quot;Gertrude Lawrence suddenly stopped singing midline and called out to Gershwin, who was monitoring from the orchestra, &#x27;Why does she say &#x27;I could wait &quot;four&quot; years&#x27; – why not five or six?&#x27; Of course, the line was &#x27;I could wait &quot;for&quot; years.&#x27; The painstaking lyricist immediately substituted &quot;the&quot; to clarify the aural ambiguity.&quot;

In 1945, Lawrence starred as Eliza Doolittle opposite Raymond Massey as Henry Higgins in a revival of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; by George Bernard Shaw, who initially resisted the idea of Lawrence playing the role. Following the Broadway run, she toured the United States (including a stint in Washington, D.C.) and Canada in the play until May 1947.

==Autobiography==
In 1945, Lawrence published the autobiography &quot;A Star Danced&quot;. Her long-term friend Noël Coward later suggested it was a romanticised and less than wholly factual account of her life. The author embarked on a cross-country tour of the United States to publicise her book, the first person to engage in such a promotion.

==World War II==
Lawrence&#x27;s second husband Richard Aldrich became a lieutenant in the United States Navy during World War II, during which time Lawrence had a standing invitation to perform for British troops from the head of the UK&#x27;s Entertainments National Service Association. Her chief obstacle was getting from her home in Massachusetts to Britain. Aldrich was overseas at the time. In her 1945 memoir &quot;A Star Danced&quot;, she recalled, &quot;After weeks of more or less patient waiting, repeated timid, pleading, urgent and finally importunate requests to the authorities who rule such matters in Washington and London, and a rapid-fire barrage of telegrams, cables and telephone calls, it had happened. At last I had permission to do what I had been wanting desperately to do for four years—go to England and do my bit on a tour for E.N.S.A.&quot;

Lawrence&#x27;s attorney booked the actress on a British Airways charter flight from Washington, D.C. to an airfield near London; the flight lasted 36 hours, including two refueling stops. When Lawrence boarded the plane, she discovered that she, Ernest Hemingway and Beatrice Lillie were among the few passengers without diplomatic passports. Lawrence and Lillie were the only female passengers. Hours after landing near London, she performed with E.N.S.A. for British and American troops who, it turned out, had been deployed for the imminent D-Day landings in Normandy. Aldrich was in one of the squadrons of the US Navy.

Aldrich wrote in his 1954 biography of his recently deceased wife: She went over with the first E.N.S.A. unit to go into France, making the crossing in an LST). Others in the party included Ivor Novello, Margaret Rutherford, Diana Wynyard and Bobbie Andrews. In her autobiography, &quot;A Star Danced&quot;, she has given a graphic account of their landing on a Normandy beach and of the progress of her unit through the wrecked towns, where there was still no water or electricity. Shows were given in shell-torn cinemas and hastily lighted casinos.

The physical discomforts – the sleeping in attics, the total lack of sanitation, the scanty and poor food – Gertrude could and did take as fortunes of war. What bothered her more was the breakdown in communications with me. Always dependent upon getting frequent letters from those she loved, she chafed and worried because no mail reached her.

As Allied forces scored more victories in the South Pacific later that year, Lawrence endured long plane rides and dangerous conditions to perform for troops there. The Aldrich book includes a photograph of Lawrence and two unidentified performers standing next to a military plane in Angaur that had just transported them there from Ulithi.

==Professional and personal connection to Daphne du Maurier==
In 1948, Lawrence returned to the United Kingdom to star in &quot;September Tide&quot;, a play written specifically for her by Daphne du Maurier. Her role was that of a middle-aged Cornish woman whose son-in-law, a bohemian artist, falls in love with her. The playwright had intended her to open the play on Broadway, but Lawrence&#x27;s husband thought it was too British for the American market.

London newspapers and magazines paid little attention to her return to the stage, and she was distressed to discover that in a country struggling to recover from the effects of World War II, the public no longer was as interested in the careers or private lives of stage stars as it once had been. Prior to opening in the West End, the play toured Blackpool, Leeds, Liverpool, and Manchester, where the frequently sparse audiences consisted primarily of elderly people who remembered Lawrence from her heyday. While on the road, she underwent erratic mood swings and frequently clashed with her fellow cast members, including actors Michael Gough and Bryan Forbes, and the crew. The play opened in London in mid-December 1948.

Writing in &quot;Punch&quot;, Eric Keown called her return &quot;an occasion for rejoicing&quot; but dismissed the play as &quot;an artificial piece of conventional sentiment which leaves the actress&#x27;s talents unused.&quot; She remained with the play until July 1949, then returned to the United States, where she performed her role for one week at her husband&#x27;s theater in Dennis, Massachusetts.

According to a 1993 biography of author-playwright du Maurier by Margaret Forster, Lawrence and du Maurier became close friends during the London production of &quot;September Tide&quot;. The nature of their relationship remained unclear following the 1989 death of du Maurier. Forster quotes du Maurier as saying the following about Lawrence circa 1949, &quot;To be blatantly vulgar, anyone with a spice of imagination would prefer a divan with Gertrude to a double-bed with her.&quot;

Lawrence biographer Sheridan Morley interviewed du Maurier for his 1981 book &quot;Gertrude Lawrence&quot;. Du Maurier was quoted as saying she called Lawrence by the nickname &quot;Cinders,&quot; short for Cinderella. Either while negotiating to appear in &quot;September Tide&quot; or rehearsing it, Lawrence stayed in &quot;a flat in London somewhere,&quot; according to what du Maurier told Morley decades later. Boiling water in her tea kettle for a visitor was stressful for Lawrence. Du Maurier also told the biographer that she had forgotten all the dialogue she had written for &quot;September Tide&quot; and that shortly before her interview with Morley she had &quot;been searching my shelves for a copy of the play. ... I cannot remember how Cinders looked, what she wore, far less what she said.&quot; Du Maurier&#x27;s contribution to the Morley biography of Lawrence consists of little more than that.

Nothing about a personal connection between Gertrude Lawrence and Daphne du Maurier was published during Lawrence&#x27;s lifetime. Two years after Lawrence&#x27;s death, her widower Richard Aldrich had this to say in a best-selling biography of his late wife, &quot;Gertrude Lawrence as Mrs. A.&quot;:All her ingenuous traits, which could be annoying as well as endearing, would be swept away by her courage, her clear perception of truth, and the divine compassion which could flood her heart and lift her to the heights of nobility.

I am sure that she was frequently bewildered by the rapidity and mutability of her own impulses. Possessed, as she was, of an intuitive rather than an analytical intelligence, I doubt that she really understood herself clearly, any more than did most of those who thought they knew her intimately. An exception in this regard was Daphne du Maurier.

During those months in England [when &quot;September Tide&quot; was in production], Gertrude and Daphne formed a warm friendship, which continued unbroken after Gertrude&#x27;s return to America. Daphne later returned the visit by being Gertrude&#x27;s guest in New York. Daphne&#x27;s subsequent best-selling novel &quot;Mary Anne&quot; was originally planned as a possible starring vehicle for Gertrude.

It was chiefly from comments made later by Daphne that I was able to reconstruct the full picture of Gertrude&#x27;s inner conflict during her stay in London. Daphne spoke of Gertrude&#x27;s moodiness, her variability, her sense of vague self-dissatisfaction. To other English friends, Gertrude talked wistfully of wanting to remain in England, &quot;where I belong.&quot;

==Film career==

Between 1929 and 1950, Lawrence appeared in only nine films. She made her screen debut in 1929 in &quot;The Battle of Paris&quot;, which featured two songs by Cole Porter. Paramount Pictures offered her the film shortly after the Broadway production of &quot;Treasure Girl&quot; unexpectedly closed and, with no prospects of stage work in the immediate future, she accepted the offer. The film, co-starring Arthur Treacher and Charles Ruggles, was shot in Paramount&#x27;s Astoria Studio complex in Astoria, Queens. Lawrence was cast as Georgie, an artist living in pre-World War I Paris, who becomes a cabaret singer and falls in love with an American soldier. Publicity for the film emphasised Lawrence&#x27;s songs and costumes rather than the story, which was so weak that director Robert Florey had threatened to resign midway through filming. Described by one critic as a &quot;floperetta,&quot; it was not a success.

In 1932, she appeared in three features: an adaptation of the Frederick Lonsdale play &quot;Aren&#x27;t We All?&quot; directed by Harry Lachman; &quot;Lord Camber&#x27;s Ladies&quot;, produced by Alfred Hitchcock, directed by Benn W. Levy, and co-starring Gerald du Maurier; and &quot;No Funny Business&quot; with Laurence Olivier. In 1935, she appeared in &quot;Mimi&quot;, based on &quot;La Vie de Bohème&quot;. The following year she was cast opposite Charles Laughton and Elsa Lanchester in &quot;Rembrandt&quot; and co-starred with Rex Harrison in &quot;Men are Not Gods&quot;, both produced by Alexander Korda.

Lawrence&#x27;s best-known American film role was that of Amanda Wingfield, the overbearing mother in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (1950), which both Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead had sought. The role required her to wear padding and affect a Southern American accent, and friends and critics questioned her decision to accept it. Tennessee Williams, who had written the play, thought casting Lawrence was &quot;a dismal error&quot; and, after the film&#x27;s release, called it the worst adaptation of his work he had seen thus far. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her Amanda &quot;a farcically exaggerated shrew with the zeal of a burlesque comedienne&quot; and &quot;a perfect imitation of a nervous Mama in domestic comedy&quot;. Writing about her performance in &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, Richard Griffith was generous in his praise, saying &quot;Not since Garbo has there been anything like the naked eloquence of her face, with its amazing play of thought and emotion.&quot;

==Television and radio==
On Tuesday night, 7 June 1938, the Broadway theatre that featured &quot;Susan and God&quot; went dark for one night so that Lawrence and her fellow cast members could perform the play for NBC&#x27;s emerging television audience, which then consisted mostly of &quot;company executives and engineers&quot; of NBC&#x27;s parent company RCA, according to a Life (magazine) report of the historic television broadcast. The number of television receivers that could pick up the telecast, all of them in or very close to New York City, was not estimated by the &quot;Life&quot; magazine writer.

The text of the &quot;Life&quot; article says the following about the few &quot;Susan and God&quot; viewers who were not employed by RCA: &quot;. . . amateurs [sic] interested in television today generally &quot;construct their own receiving sets&quot; at home . . .&quot; (emphasis added). At that time, RCA did not yet have an already-constructed television set available for purchase at a store.

Viewers not employed by RCA or able to build television sets are described as &quot;drama critics and radio columnists&quot; who &quot;witnessed the performance on sets many floors above the studios where&quot; the &quot;Susan and God&quot; cast performed. The building is referred to by the &quot;Life&quot; writer as &quot;New York&#x27;s Radio City,&quot; apparently 30 Rockefeller Plaza. A caption for one of the still photos of the live telecast indicates that a view of the exterior of the &quot;30 Rock&quot; building was the final image that viewers saw while a voice-over identified it as the origin of the television broadcast.

Many still photos from the live telecast were featured in the &quot;Life&quot; article, which was published almost two weeks later in the edition dated 20 June 1938. The event was newsworthy because it was the first full-length play live-broadcast on television. The text of the article says that technology required the actors to perform in a studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza that RCA engineers had designed, during construction of the skyscraper five years earlier, for the anticipated medium of television. Primitive television cameras and lighting could not function properly inside a Broadway theatre.

In 1943, Lawrence hosted a weekly series of American radio shows, some of them featuring discussions with guests and others adaptations of Hollywood hit films. In 1947, she returned to NBC for a production of the 1913 Shaw play &quot;The Great Catherine&quot;.

To promote &quot;The King and I&quot;, Lawrence appeared on various television programs, including the Ed Sullivan-hosted &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, with Rodgers and Hammerstein joining her to perform selections from the show.

Additionally, she appeared on several BBC Radio interview and variety shows before and after World War II.

==Financial difficulties==
Throughout her adult life, except during World War II, Lawrence spent far more than she earned. Philip Astley had persuaded her to place £1,000 in a trust fund for her daughter, but aside from that she had no savings of her own. During her engagement to Bert Taylor he managed her finances and encouraged her to invest in the productions in which she starred. Although she earned a considerable amount of money from &quot;Private Lives&quot;, she still was deeply in debt, at one point owing fashion entrepreneur Hattie Carnegie more than $10,000. She opened accounts with dozens of shop owners but assumed she had unlimited credit and paid little attention to the invoices they sent.

Finally, two London laundry owners, whose bills totalled just under £50, filed a writ demanding she declare bankruptcy if she was unable to settle her accounts, and Lawrence&#x27;s financial affairs came under the scrutiny of the Official Receiver. On 26 February 1935, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported her assets were valued at £1,879 but her liabilities were nearly £35,000, with an additional £10,000 owed to the Inland Revenue on her earnings in the United States.

Later in 1935, Lawrence&#x27;s flat, cars, clothing, and jewellery were seized by the &quot;London bankruptcy court&quot; (words used by the Associated Press), and Lawrence, her maid and her dog were forced to move into a flat owned by her agent. On 8 November 1935, accused of &quot;gross extravagance,&quot; she was ordered &quot;to pay £50 weekly from the proceeds of her present [nightclub] engagement, and 25 per cent of anything earned any other way should the engagement end,&quot; according to the same Associated Press report.

It was later discovered that Lawrence had never paid American taxes, either. Her attorney Fanny Holtzmann worked out an agreement whereby $150 would be deducted from her salary each week she worked in the United States until her American tax debt was settled.

Refusing to lower her standard of living, she decided to take film work during the day, appear on stage at night, and perform in late-night cabarets to support her spending habits. Much to the distress of her agent, she purchased a country house and farm in Buckinghamshire, then left it vacant while she remained in the United States for a lengthy stay. When her agent questioned the wisdom of such a move, she replied asking him to investigate the cost of installing a swimming pool on the property.

==Columbia University==
&quot;Early in September [1951 during the Broadway run of &quot;The King and I&quot;]&quot;, wrote Lawrence&#x27;s widower Richard Aldrich, &quot;she calmly announced that she had accepted an appointment to the Faculty of Columbia University, in the School of Dramatic Arts, of which Dr. Milton Smith was Director. Her particular post was to conduct Class 107 in the Study of Roles and Scenes. The class met on Thursday afternoons in the Brander Matthews Theatre on Morningside Heights.&quot;

&quot;I shall be teaching an advanced, not an elementary course,&quot; Aldrich quoted her as saying in 1951. &quot;Dr. Smith and I have screened all the students. They&#x27;ve had preliminary work in voice, speech and pantomime. Many of them are already working professionally in radio and television. But, more than that, if I can find one person of real talent and encourage and train him, I&#x27;ll feel that I&#x27;ve done something worthwhile.&quot;
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on 28 September 1951 that Lawrence &quot;suffered an attack of stage fright yesterday and refused to let reporters observe her in her new role of teacher at Columbia University.&quot;

She taught the class again in the spring 1952 semester at Columbia, this time allowing a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter and photographer to attend and take pictures.

==&quot;The King and I&quot;==
&quot;The King and I&quot; got started when, in 1950, Lawrence&#x27;s business manager and attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a new property for her client. Lawrence went to see the film &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; with her mother-in-law then asked Fanny Holtzmann to look into acquiring the rights to the book. A William Morris agent sent Holtzmann a copy of the 1944 book &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;, by his client Margaret Landon. Lawrence thought a musical version would be better. Lawrence wanted Cole Porter to write the score, but when he proved to be unenthusiastic about the suggestion, Lawrence sent the book to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. Rodgers initially demurred because he felt Lawrence&#x27;s vocal range was limited and she had a tendency to sing flat. But he realized the story had strong potential, and the two men agreed to write what ultimately became &quot;The King and I&quot;.

The musical opened on Broadway in March 1951, and in 1952, Lawrence won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.

Her triumph was short-lived; her health deteriorated rapidly, forcing her to miss numerous performances until she finally was hospitalized with what would be her final illness. While bedridden in New York Hospital on Friday afternoon, 5 September 1952, she instructed Fanny Holtzmann to arrange for co-star Yul Brynner&#x27;s name to be added to the marquee of the St. James Theatre, which included only Lawrence&#x27;s name at the time.

==Death and funeral==
On 16 August 1952, Lawrence fainted backstage after a Saturday matinee of &quot;The King and I&quot;. After &quot;a few days at home,&quot; wrote her husband Richard Aldrich, she was admitted for tests to what was then called New York Hospital. Doctors said she was suffering from hepatitis, and she was admitted to a room on the 16th floor. Her former son-in-law, Dr. William G. Cahan, recalled in his 1992 memoir (by then he was a globally recognised medical expert on cancer) what happened next in 1952:
She was admitted to New York Hospital [located across the street from the hospital where Cahan worked on the staff]. Her doctors were puzzled by what was described in the press as &quot;a liver problem,&quot; and suspected that she might have cancer. Hearing this, and without Gertrude&#x27;s knowledge, her husband [Dick Aldrich] consulted me. Not wanting to alarm her by appearing in person (she knew, of course, that by now I was a cancer specialist), I sent some of my colleagues as consultants. They, too, were puzzled, and ordered an exploratory laparotomy (abdominal operation).

At dawn of the day the operation was to take place [Saturday, September 6], Dick Aldrich called [Cahan on the telephone]: Gertrude had become comatose; would I please come to the hospital at once? I found her surrounded by interns frantically pumping intravenous fluids and stimulants into her. As I bent over her, she opened her eyes for a second or two, looked up at me, and made a face as if to say, &quot;What are &quot;you&quot; doing here?&quot;

A few minutes later, she died.

Concerned and curious about what had caused her death, I was present at her autopsy. This showed that she had widespread liver and abdominal cancer, the source of which was never clarified.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, for Lawrence&#x27;s funeral 5,000 people crowded the intersection of East 55th Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, while 1,800 others, including Yul Brynner, Connecticut Governor John Davis Lodge, Marlene Dietrich, Phil Silvers, Luise Rainer, Moss Hart and his wife Kitty Carlisle, filled Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church.

In his eulogy, Oscar Hammerstein II quoted from an essay on death written by poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore. Lawrence was buried in the champagne-coloured gown designed by Irene Sharaff and worn for the &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot; number in the second act of &quot;The King and I&quot;, and she was interred in the Aldrich family plot in Lakeview Cemetery in Upton, Massachusetts. She was the first person for whom the house lights were dimmed in all Broadway theaters during the immediate aftermath of a beloved performer’s death.

==Legacy==
In early 1953, Lawrence&#x27;s name was included on a list of Columbia University professors who had died the previous year and were honoured with a memorial service and flags on the campus lowered to half-staff.

Richard Aldrich&#x27;s biography of his late wife became a best-seller in late 1954 and 1955, and was purchased by Marilyn Monroe at a New York bookstore.

Lawrence&#x27;s biographer Sheridan Morley wrote in 1981 that throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, &quot;...most traces of Gertrude Lawrence ... disappeared; she died before television had begun to immortalise its artists on (video)tape, before radio shows were regularly recorded, and though she made half a dozen films, her appearances in them are mostly undistinguished and give no clear impression of a radiance which could hold theatre audiences spellbound.&quot;

Julie Andrews portrayed Lawrence in the musical biographical film &quot;Star!&quot;, released to cinemas in 1968. It was loosely based on the period of her life from her days as an unknown aspiring performer until her wedding to Richard Aldrich. Richard Crenna appeared as Aldrich. The real Aldrich, who in the 1960s no longer worked in the entertainment business, was a consultant on the film. Noël Coward was portrayed by Daniel Massey. &quot;Star!&quot; was a box office failure.

&quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; was Gertrude Lawrence&#x27;s only film that was a box-office success and in which she worked with an American studio and an entirely American cast: Jane Wyman (Laura), Arthur Kennedy (Tom), Kirk Douglas (The Gentleman Caller). The director was an Englishman whose entire career was in American cinema. The movie was rarely shown on American television until 1992, however. During that year, American Movie Classics revived it with an introduction and postscript from the channel&#x27;s host, Bob Dorian. He provided information about Lawrence for American viewers who were not familiar with her.

Janet McTeer portrayed Lawrence opposite Geraldine Somerville as Daphne du Maurier and Malcolm Sinclair as Noël Coward in &quot;Daphne&quot;, a fictionalized television movie that was first broadcast by the BBC in 2007.

Three years after Lawrence&#x27;s death, her daughter Pamela gave birth to Benn Clatworthy, by her second husband, the sculptor Robert Clatworthy. The first of Lawrence&#x27;s three grandchildren, Benn was a tenor saxophonist based in Los Angeles. Lawrence&#x27;s other two grandchildren, Sarah Hunt and Tom Clatworthy, are both residents of the United Kingdom.

==In popular culture==
In the classic Moss Hart and George Kaufman play &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, the character Lorraine Sheldon was inspired by Gertrude Lawrence.

Lawrence&#x27;s recording of the song &quot;Getting to Know You&quot; from &quot;The King and I&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the sitcom &quot;The King of Queens&quot; in the episode &quot;Arthur, Spooner.&quot; It was originally telecast in the United States on CBS on 23 September 2002 as the season premiere. It has been repeated many times in syndication, on TBS (US TV channel) in the United States and is available on the DVD for the Complete Fifth Season.

<doc id="592844" wikidata="Q44240" url="?curid=592844" title="Viedma, Río Negro">
<text>Viedma () is the capital and fourth largest city of the Río Negro Province, in northern Patagonia, Argentina. The city has 59,993 inhabitants (2022), and is located on the southern margin of the Negro River, about 30 kilometres off the Atlantic Coast, and 960 km from the city of Buenos Aires on the National Route 3.

== History ==
Together with the city of Carmen de Patagones across the river in Buenos Aires Province, Viedma is the oldest European settlement in Patagonia, founded by Francisco de Viedma y Narváez under the name of &quot;Nuestra Señora del Carmen&quot; on 22 April 1779. Originally the two cities were one, called Carmen de Patagones. The original fort was built on the south side of the river in modern Viedma, but it was destroyed within a few months. A new fort was built on the north side, in modern Carmen de Patagones. This fort lasted much longer, and the tower still stands today. The town grew and eventually expanded back across the river into modern-day Viedma. On 11 October 1878, the town was split, with the Río Negro as their border.

With the Conquest of the Desert, the city became the capital of all Argentine Patagonia and later, when that was further divided into smaller territories, the capital of the Río Negro Territory. In 1880, Alvaro Barros, the first governor of Río Negro, changed the name of the city to Viedma. During severe flooding in 1889, the capital of Río Negro was temporary moved to Choele Choel, but was quickly restored to Viedma.

In 1986, during the presidency of Raúl Alfonsín, a proposal was made to move the federal capital from Buenos Aires to Viedma. This was to reduce congestion in Buenos Aires, to help develop Patagonia, and to promote the development of the interior. A bill to that effect was passed by Congress the following year, but owing to economic problems, the project had stagnated by the end of the Alfonsín administration in 1989.

== Economy ==
The main economical activities in the area of the Valle Inferior are cattle, as well as some agriculture with onion, maize and alfalfa being the most important. However, Viedma is mainly an administrative city, being the capital city of the province.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Viedma has a cool semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;). The nearby South Atlantic Ocean and the Viedma river moderate the climate.

The city is windy throughout the year. Average windspeeds range from a low of to in December. Generally, the windiest period is from October to February while March to June are the less windy. The cause of this is attributed to the effects produced by the convergence of distinct wind currents that are directed around the general atmospheric circulation from both the South Atlantic High and the South Pacific High. As it is located in a transitional area between the South Atlantic High to the east and the South Pacific High, to the west, its position is responsible for experiencing shifting wind directions and wind speeds all through the year. Occasionally, strong gusts exceeding can occur.

Winters are cool with a July mean of and frosts are common, averaging 9–10 days from June to August. During this period of the year, overcast days are common, averaging 9–10 days per month although sunny days are fairly common as well. Spring and autumn are transition seasons featuring warm daytime temperatures and cool overnight temperatures and are highly variable with some days reaching above and below . Summers are hot and dry with a January high of and a low of . The diurnal range (difference between average high and average low) is large, which, along with the temperature profile of Viedma makes it suitable for growing a wide variety of subtropical crops. Humid days are rare owing to the low humidity (around 50%) and a dewpoint temperature of . During the hottest days in summer when the wind is from the northwest or west, sea breezes can occur that move inland in the opposite direction below the prevailing wind direction which moderate summer temperatures. This occurs because when the surrounding land heats faster than the sea, it causes the land to have lower atmospheric pressure than the sea which has a relatively higher atmospheric pressure. The resulting pressure difference causes the sea breeze to push inland into the lower pressure area. In contrast, during night, the reverse occurs as the land cools faster than the surrounding sea. Frosts that occur in winter are usually of short duration and are not intense. The average date of the first frost occurs on 8 April and the last frost occurs on 21 November and there are 210 frost free days in an average year.

Relative humidity is low, averaging 62%, with the summer months being drier than the winter months. Nonetheless, high humidity conditions may occasionally be experienced, particularly during early morning and late evening when temperatures are lower. On average, Viedma receives of precipitation per year which is evenly distributed through the year. During spring and summer, precipitation occurs irregularly and there is a water deficit, owing to higher temperatures and windier conditions that promote evapotranspiration and drier conditions. In winter and autumn, precipitation occurs regularly resulting in a lower water deficit owing to lower temperatures, more moderate winds, and higher humidity (lower evapotranspiration). On average, there are 73 days with measurable precipitation. Summers tend to have fewer rainy days than winter due to rainfall occurring more intensely (shorter bursts).

Viedma receives 2620 hours of sunshine per year or 57.7% of possible sunshine per year, ranging from a low of 43.5% in July to a high of 69% in March. This makes Viedma relatively sunny in comparison to the average for the country. The highest recorded temperature was on 18 February 1987, while the lowest recorded temperature was on 4 July 1988.


== Transport ==
The Gobernador Castello Airport serves flights to Buenos Aires, Neuquén, Bariloche, Puerto Madryn, Trelew, Comodoro Rivadavia, Mar del Plata, and other cities in Argentina. It is located 6 km from the city, and has an average annual traffic of 30,000 passengers.
30 km downstream from Viedma, on the Atlantic shore, the &quot;El Cóndor&quot; beach resort town (Balneario Massini) is the most visited tourist beach in the area. The Servicios Ferroviarios Patagónico connect with San Carlos de Bariloche.

<doc id="592845" wikidata="Q44239" url="?curid=592845" title="Neuquén">
<text>Neuquén (; ) is the capital city of the Argentine province of Neuquén and of the Confluencia Department, located in the east of the province. It occupies a strip of land west of the confluence of the Limay and Neuquén rivers which form the Río Negro, making it part of the ecoregion of Alto Valle del Río Negro. The city and surrounding area have a population of more than 340,000, making it the largest city in Patagonia. Along with the cities of Plottier and Cipolletti, it is part of the Neuquén – Plottier – Cipolletti conurbation.

Founded in 1904, it is the newest provincial capital city in Argentina. 

==Etymology==
The name of the city comes from the Neuquén River, which in Mapuche language means &quot;water that has strength&quot;. This name was already used since 1884 for the federal territory. Since 1902, it was used for the railway station of the town, which at that time was a hamlet called Confluencia. The name of the town was officially chosen in 1904, when it was declared the capital of the territory. It is the only Argentine city that has a palindrome name, that is a word which reads the same backward as forward.

==Economy==
Neuquén is both an important agricultural center, surrounded by fertile lands irrigated by the waters of the Limay and Neuquén rivers in an otherwise arid province, and a petrochemical industrial center that receives oil extracted from different points of the province. It belongs economically and geographically to the Alto Valle region that produces apples, pears, and other fruits.

With the discovery of the Vaca Muerta oil fields west of the city (the third largest shale gas and oil reserves in the world), it has begun to experience a boom in real estate and construction. It is expected that over the next few years the city will experience unprecedented growth as it is the only significant city in the region. It has an airport, shopping centers, office space and institutions to become the center of the operations not only of the oil and gas companies, but also their suppliers.

==Transport==
National Route 22 (RN22) is the main road linking Neuquén with the rest of Argentina. Since 2021 it runs in eastern-western direction north of the city center through the &quot;Parque Industrial&quot; area, mostly as a four-lane motorway, linking the city with the Atlantic coast at Bahía Blanca to the East and Temuco (Chile), San Carlos de Bariloche and Zapala to the West and South-West. The former RN22, now called &quot;Avenida General Mosconi&quot;, a wide fast-transit avenue, runs in east-western direction through the southern part of the city center and divides the city into two halves.

The Presidente Perón Airport is west of the city center near the boundary to Plottier and serves regular flights to Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Salta, Mendoza, Comodoro Rivadavia and San Martín de los Andes.

The Tren del Valle commuter rail service links Neuquén with neighbouring Cipolletti and Plottier. Freight trains run to Bahía Blanca and Zapala.

Local transport consists of 30 bus lines, connecting most areas of the city, including Plottier and Las Perlas. The network is run by bus companies &quot;Ko-Ko&quot; and &quot;Empresa Tigre Iguazú&quot;. Additionally, several suburban lines connect the city with other cities and towns in the wider metro area, like Cipolletti, Centenario, Senillosa, General Roca and Villa Regina.

While the Río Negro and Río Limay are navigable, there are no port facilities in Neuquén and nearby cities. There was some commercial navigation in the Alto Valle area in the first half of the 20th century, but it has been abandoned since then.

==History==
The first inhabitants of the area were very mobile and moved according to the seasons of the year, climatic conditions, and the abundance of food and game. Around the 16th century the people living in different areas of the province began to be assimilated by the Mapuche people. One of the most important trails used by the Mapuches passed through the area of the confluence of the Limay and Neuquén rivers. 

In the 17th century European explorers arrived in the area of the confluence. 

In 1604, Hernando Arias de Saavedra decided to explore the trails to Patagonia. With the support of the ranchers of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Corrientes, he departed from Buenos Aires and passed through the mountains of the Sierra de la Ventana. He reached what is now the city of Neuquén and continued on, possibly passing through what is today Auca Mahuida. 

In 1782, departing from Carmen de Patagones, Basilio Villarino traveled upstream on the Río Negro. On 23 January 1783, he arrived at the confluence of the Limay and Neuquén Rivers, camping on an island. He then followed the Limay to the confluence of the Collón Curá, then from there to the Chimehuin River.

===Neuquén as an Argentine Province===
In 1885, the lands of what was at that time called Confluencia (i.e., &quot;confluence,&quot; referring to the two rivers) were auctioned to a few people. Shortly after the Conquest of the Desert campaign conducted by the military over Patagonia, the Tehuelche and Pehuenche tribes that inhabited the province of Neuquén were either killed or pushed out of these lands.

Since there was no defined border with Chile, the Argentine government reached an agreement with the British-owned Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway company that was constructing a railway network, mainly in Buenos Aires Province, to build an extension to the town in exchange for lands, in order to populate it. In 1899, the railroad reached Cipolletti in Río Negro province, and three years later, after the construction of the bridge, arrived at Neuquén.

Neuquén was officially founded on 12 September 1904, and the capital of the territory was transferred from Chos Malal to the young town. The name &quot;Neuquén&quot; derives from the Mapudungun word &quot;nehuenken&quot;, meaning drafty, which the native people used in reference to this river.

By 1930, the town had only 5,000 inhabitants. In the 1960s, it acquired a new importance when oil deposits were found in the province by the state company YPF. The 1970s and 1980s saw massive demographic growth, accompanied by improvements such as the creation of the National University of Comahue in 1971.

In 2020, Sister Mónica Astorga Cremona, a Carmelite nun, founded Costa Limay Sustainable Complex for Transgender Women in Neuquén, the first permanent housing program in the world for transgender people.

==Climate==
Neuquén has an arid climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;). Precipitation is low, averaging per year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. The mean annual temperature is between . During December and January, the mean temperature in these months is about while in July, it reaches below . Being located far away from any major bodies of water, the thermal amplitude is high along with a large diurnal range, which indicates continental characteristics of the climate of the city.

Winds are moderately strong throughout the year, which favors evapotranspiration. Most of the wind comes from the west and the southwest, both of which occur 40–50% of the time. Summers tend to be windier than winters with average wind speeds ranging from a low of in July to a high of in December. Mean daily sunshine hours range from a high of 11 hours/day in January to a low of 3 hours/day in June.

The highest temperature recorded was on 21 January 1980 while the lowest temperature recorded was on 13 June 1961.

==Museums and historical landmarks==
There are cultural spaces housed in former railroad buildings from the early 20th century, such as the Gregorio Álvarez and the Paraje Confluencia museums and the Emilio Saraco Art Gallery. The more recently-built Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, designed by Mario Roberto Alvarez, opened in 2004. The museum showcases both national and international artists. The building consists of four halls which include both the temporary and the permanent collection, as well as an auditorium and theater.

<text>Canwest Global Communications Corporation, which operated under the corporate name Canwest, was a major Canadian media conglomerate based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, with its head offices at Canwest Place (now called 201 Portage). It held radio, television broadcasting, and publishing assets in several countries, primarily in Canada.

Canwest was founded in 1974 by Izzy Asper through the formation of CIII-TV in Toronto under the Global Television Network. The company expanded through the 1980s and 1990s, with the initial public offering in 1991 as a publicly traded corporation and the international expansion of its operations in Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Turkey. Throughout the years, under Leonard Asper, who became its president and CEO in 1999, Canwest grew into a major media powerhouse by acquiring media properties such as Western International Communications and the Southam newspaper publishing. In 2007, with Goldman Sachs, Canwest acquired the broadcasting arm of Alliance Atlantis.

After years of debt, Canwest began to slowly collapse in 2008, amid the Great Recession and later entered bankruptcy protection in late 2009, which led to the sale of its publishing and broadcasting arms the following year to Postmedia Network, founded by &quot;National Post&quot; CEO Paul Godfrey and Shaw Communications, which later reorganized its media division as Shaw Media. On April 1, 2016, the broadcasting assets were subsumed into Corus Entertainment, an existing broadcasting firm also owned by the Shaw family.

Following the sale of assets, the company was renamed 2737469 Canada Inc., ceased to carry on business, and commenced bankruptcy proceedings under the &quot;Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act&quot; before finally being dissolved on May 27, 2013.

==Operations==

As of April 2009 (prior to seeking creditor protection), Canwest owned, in whole or part, a variety of Canadian media assets, including:
* Global, a primary Canadian television network which reached over 94% of the English-speaking population of Canada;
* E!, a now-defunct secondary Canadian television system consisted of five smaller market stations; however, through repeaters and cable television, it reaches the majority of major Canadian markets. The &quot;E!&quot; name was licensed by the American channel of the same name, which also supplies the majority of its programming outside of local news and regional programming and primetime shows from the American broadcast networks;
* Specialty services including Showcase, Slice, HGTV, TVTropolis, Food Network, History Television, and various digital services;
* Southam Inc. and its former properties, which included the number-two national newspaper &quot;National Post&quot;, the broadsheet daily newspapers in most major markets, several other smaller newspapers, and the Canwest News Service newswire. Canwest was Canada&#x27;s largest newspaper publisher;
* Production, distribution, and Internet assets associated with all the Canwest properties

The company had previously sold off some of the smaller newspapers it had acquired in the Southam purchase. Canwest also previously owned broadcasting operations in Australia (as majority shareholder of Network Ten), New Zealand (through CanWest MediaWorks New Zealand), the Republic of Ireland (as a minority shareholder of TV3) and Turkey (as the owners of four radio stations).

==History==

===Beginnings===
In 1974, a group led by Israel Asper bought the assets of Pembina, North Dakota television station KCND-TV from broadcaster Gordon McLendon, moving the station to Winnipeg as an independent station CKND-TV. Asper, through his company, Canwest, eventually bought out his partners in the Winnipeg station. A few months later, the Asper group joined a consortium that bought CKGN-TV, a network of six simulcasting transmitters across Ontario that carried many of CKND&#x27;s programs and was known on-air as the Global Television Network. Canwest bought controlling interest in Global, now using the callsign CIII-TV, in 1985, thus becoming the first western-based owner of a major Canadian broadcaster. He acquired the remaining stock in 1989.

Canwest subsequently invested in or acquired other independent TV stations across Canada. Eventually, his station group became known as the &quot;Canwest Global System.&quot; In 1997, Canwest bought a controlling interest in CKMI-TV, the privately owned CBC affiliate in Quebec City. Canwest then set up CKMI rebroadcasters in Montreal and Sherbrooke. With this move, Canwest&#x27;s stations now had enough coverage of Canada that on August 18—the day CKMI officially disaffiliated from CBC—Canwest scrubbed all local brands from its stations, rebranding them as &quot;The Global Television Network,&quot; Canada&#x27;s third television network. Throughout the 1990s, Global (and its antecedents) held Canadian rights to hit U.S. series such as &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, and &quot;Frasier&quot;.

Canwest also bought broadcasting assets internationally, including outlets in New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, and Australia, although all were eventually sold off. In 1991, Canwest issued a successful initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In June 1996, Canwest was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

===Beyond broadcasting and the newspapers===
Lacking a presence in Alberta, the company set its sights on Western International Communications, which owned three independent stations in that province that carried Global programming. It eventually bought that company&#x27;s broadcasting assets in 2000. This not only boosted Global&#x27;s coverage in western Canada but prompted the establishment of a second over-the-air service, originally known as CH, since in some areas the combined company had duplicate over-the-air coverage through multiple stations. Later that year, Canwest announced its acquisition of the Southam newspaper chain from Conrad Black, in order to pursue a media convergence strategy. 
Canwest was initially slow to invest in specialty channels due to the strength of its terrestrial network. In 1999, seeking to change this, the company announced a deal to buy out the Canadian partners of NetStar Communications, owner of TSN, but was stymied by U.S. partner ESPN, which had veto power over such a sale. ESPN instead came to terms with Canwest&#x27;s main rival CTV, a longtime business partner of ESPN&#x27;s parent company Disney, as an acceptable buyer, which the selling partners eventually agreed to.

In an effort to get into the entertainment business, the company had bought out producer/distributor Fireworks Entertainment in 1998, and gained interest in Seven Arts Pictures, a film production company. CanWest would sell its entertainment unit in 2005.

In 2005, CanWest launched a new website, Canada.com, which served as a digital media platform for its rebranded brands in the digital space. These brands encompassed various local news outlets, major newspapers, and other media entities. The brands were collectively presented under the &quot;canada.com Network&quot; and included the following (as listed in the website footer): Newspapers: National Post, Calgary Herald, Edmonton Journal, The Montreal Gazette, Ottawa Citizen, Regina Leader Post, The Saskatoon Star Phoenix, The Vancouver Sun, The Vancouver Province, Victoria Times Colonist, The Windsor Star, Dose, Vancouver Island Newspaper, VANNEET Newspaper; Television: Global, CH, Prime TV, Fox Sports World Canada, Lonestar, Mystery, Xtreme Sports, Deje View, mentv, Cool TV; Radio: CoolFM 99.1, 91.5 The Beat; Marketplace: working.com, driving.ca, connecting, celebrating, remembering, homes. The website experience revolved around news, city guides, activities, and events to enhance advertising revenue. The site was developed by Cossette/Fjord based in Toronto, Canada, in 2005.

In October 2005, CanWest&#x27;s Canadian newspapers were sold into an IPO trust. Sold 25.8% of Canada&#x27;s newspapers for C$550 million. Attached to the Canadian newspaper IPO was $850 million in long-term debt. CanWest bought back the 25.8% Newspaper Trust IPO (and debt) in November 2008, for cash considerations of $495 million. In April 2006, Canwest acquired four radio stations in Turkey: Super FM, Metro FM, Joy FM and Joy Turk FM from The Turkish Savings and Deposit Insurance Fund for aggregate cash consideration of US$61 million.

The company was already one of the largest owners of Canadian local TV stations when Canwest and Goldman Sachs, in 2007, announced they would jointly acquire Canadian producer and competing broadcaster Alliance Atlantis and its massive stable of wide-distribution specialty channels. Under the deal, Canwest took control of the broadcasting portion of AAC, although Goldman Sachs remained a major investor in those assets. Goldman retained or resold the remaining pieces of AAC, the distribution arm soon re-emerging as Alliance Films.

Canwest executives testified in the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission hearings over fee-for-carriage, requesting that the commission force cable and satellite companies to pay for their signals without passing the fees on to their subscribers. In his testimony, Canwest president Leonard Asper blamed the current rules for the poor financial condition of Canada&#x27;s broadcast television stations, a position which has subsequently been adopted and addressed through rule changes by the CRTC and FCC.

===Restructuring, creditor protection, bankruptcy, and liquidation===
Canwest&#x27;s various acquisitions took a significant financial toll. As early as 2002, most of Canwest&#x27;s operating income was going to pay interest on its high-interest-rate debt. By 2007, the company&#x27;s bonds were downgraded to junk status. By early 2009, it became clear the company&#x27;s debt was not manageable during the Great Recession, forcing Canwest into an extended set of negotiations with its lenders and a series of cost-cutting moves. The company&#x27;s income statements reported net losses in 2008 and 2009, even though its operating activities were profitable (before taxes, interest, and non-operating charges: C$197 million in 2009, vs. C$428 million in 2008).

In May 2009, Canwest sold off four radio stations in Turkey to Spectrum Medya.

On August 31, 2009, Canwest shut down its secondary system E! (the former CH). Three of the former E! owned-and-operated stations – CHCH Hamilton, CHEK Victoria, and CJNT Montreal – were sold to third parties, while a fourth, CHBC Kelowna, was converted to a Global station. The remaining station, CHCA Red Deer, was closed as of the same date.

On September 24, the company announced that it would sell its 50.1% stake in Ten Network Holdings for A$680 million, in order to pay down its significant debt. The sale of CanWest&#x27;s Australian media operations reduced some C$582-million in debt tied to the Australian TV network, raising the total value Canwest can erase from its overall debt to more than C$1.2-billion. Before the Ten deal, Canwest held about C$3.8-billion of debt on its balance sheet. In court documents, Goldman Sachs alleges &quot;fraudulent&quot; and &quot;abusive&quot; changes to the internal operation of Canwest in the days before it filed for creditor protection. As part of the filing, the Wall Street investment bank is seeking to undo these changes, and has also claimed that CanWest&#x27;s creditors should return the C$426 million they received from Canwest balance sheet in September, after CanWest sold its stake in Ten.

On October 6, the company voluntarily filed for creditor protection under the CCAA, due to C$4 billion mounting debt across radio, television broadcasting and publishing assets in several countries. At the same time it announced it had agreed to a recapitalization transaction with some of its lenders, which will likely require the approval of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). When completed, bondholders – led by hedge funds West Face Capital, GoldenTree Asset Management, and Beach Point Capital Management – will own a majority of shares, leaving existing shareholders, including the Asper family, with a total of 2.3% of the &quot;new&quot; Canwest. However, the Aspers are expected to invest a further C$15 million in the restructured entity.

In January 2010, CanWest&#x27;s bonds commanded about 70 cents on the dollar. CanWest&#x27;s bonds at one point traded for as little as 15 cents on the dollar. Several sources say that as CanWest notes increased fivefold in price, distressed-debt funds took profits on part of their position, with Angelo Gordon among the buyers.

On February 3, 2010, it was reported that a group led by Golden Tree Asset Management LP complained that &quot;it was unfairly frozen out of the auction of Canwest Limited Partnership.&quot;

As part of the transaction, Canwest and some of its subsidiaries, including Canwest Media Inc., The National Post Company, and Canwest Television LP (the licensee of Global, MovieTime, DejaView, and Fox Sports World Canada) filed for creditor protection under the Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangements Act. Canwest Limited Partnership, a subsidiary that owns the company&#x27;s other newspaper assets and online properties, is negotiating separately with creditors and is expected to file for creditor protection at a later date. Specialty channels operated in partnership with other companies (such as TVtropolis, Mystery TV, MenTV, and the former Alliance Atlantis properties) are also not included in the present filing. Canwest shares were also suspended from trading on the TSX.

Canwest said that it was not being liquidated at this point, and the company insisted that the proceedings would make Canwest &quot;a stronger industry competitor with a renewed financial outlook.&quot; Nevertheless, some analysts expected that the conglomerate would sell assets or be broken up entirely as the restructuring process continues, noting that the publishing division has a separate set of lenders. As it turned out, the company would indeed be broken up.

===Sale of assets to Shaw and Postmedia===
In February 2010, the company announced an agreement with Shaw Communications whereby the latter company would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity, pending approvals from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and others. The company&#x27;s newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were already sold separately to Postmedia Network. However, the Asper family with Goldman and Catalyst made their own bid to retake Canwest with a $120 million bid in competition with the bid proposed by Shaw Communications. On February 25, 2010, it was announced that Shaw Communications had won a court battle to continue their plans to purchase assets &amp; voting shares from Canwest. After the announcement, Shaw revealed that its investment amounted to a minimum of $95-million in exchange for 20 percent of the equity and an 80 percent voting interest in the restructured company.

Although Goldman, Catalyst, and the Aspers continued to work on their own bid after the Shaw agreement, Shaw announced a revised agreement, following court-ordered mediation, under which it would purchase the entirety of Canwest&#x27;s broadcasting operations, including the portion owned by Goldman. This deal was later modified following a second court-ordered mediation to include a settlement agreement between Shaw, creditors, and the Official Ad Hoc Committee of Shareholders, led by the Aspers, Blott Asset Management, L.L.C. and two other hedge funds. This marked the first successful equity committee campaign in Canada under CCAA. A modified deal, including the Settlement Agreement, received the approval of the Ontario Superior Court on June 23, 2010, the Competition Bureau as of August 13, 2010, and was given final approval from the CRTC on October 22, 2010, with Canwest delisting itself from the TSX and officially ceasing operations that same month. Final closing would officially occur in October 2011 following the official CMI Transition Order. Meanwhile, Shaw Communications reorganized Canwest into Shaw Media.
After bankruptcy proceedings concluded under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, Canwest, by this point known as &quot;2737469 Canada, Inc.&quot;, finally dissolved on May 27, 2013. Asper, through his Syngus Corp. holding company, went on to establish Anthem Media Group in 2010 and has since grown into the portfolio through the ownership of Impact Wrestling, AXS TV, Fight Network and GameTV.

In April 2016, the Shaw Media assets were subsumed by Shaw&#x27;s sister company Corus Entertainment.

==Corporate governance==

===Board of directors===
The last members of the board of directors of the company were Derek Burney, David Drybrough, David Kerr, Leonard Asper, Izzy Asper, Lisa Pankratz, Frank McKenna, David Asper, and Gail Asper. Gail Asper, David Asper, and Lisa Pankratz resigned from the board, and from all other director and officer positions within Canwest and its subsidiaries, on February 10, 2010.

==Editorial controversies==
Since the 2000 acquisition of the major former Canadian newspaper holdings of Conrad Black&#x27;s Hollinger International (now Sun-Times Media Group), including Canwest News Service, opposition has been expressed by some journalists, union spokespersons, politicians, and pundits about Canwest&#x27;s enforcement of its corporate editorial positions. A 2001 decision to run regular uniform national editorials in all metropolitan dailies (except &quot;National Post&quot;), whereby local editorial boards could not take local positions on subjects of national editorials, ignited major national controversy and was subsequently withdrawn.

Conflict over Canwest editorial control and policy has focused in particular on three issues:

* The Liberal Party of Canada. Since Israel Asper&#x27;s leadership of the Manitoba Liberal Party, the Asper family has been identified with Liberal politics and politicians. In July 2001, Southam national affairs columnist Lawrence Martin was fired after a column of his critical of Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien was not published. Russell Mills, long-time publisher of &quot;The Ottawa Citizen&quot;, was fired in June 2002 after the newspaper published a series of articles exposing a financial scandal involving Prime Minister Chrétien, and called on him to resign. Canwest newspapers and broadcast outlets in British Columbia were criticized for giving a &quot;free ride&quot; to the BC Liberal government of Premier Gordon Campbell, while coverage of the New Democratic Party was criticized as being unfairly negative. However, as of 2006, at least one Asper family member (David Asper) was publicly supporting the Conservatives.
* The government of Israel and conflict in the Middle East. Veteran &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; reporter Bill Marsden has said that the Aspers &quot;do not want any criticism of Israel. We do not run in our newspaper op-ed pieces that express criticism of Israel and what it is doing.&quot; A study released in 2006 by the Near East Cultural and Educational Foundation of Canada found that the &quot;National Post&quot; was 83.3 times more likely to report an Israeli child&#x27;s death than a Palestinian child&#x27;s death in its news articles&#x27; headlines or first paragraphs. In 2008, Canwest launched a lawsuit against the Palestine Media Collective for producing a newspaper parody of &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; that satirized this bias. In 2004, the Reuters news agency protested after Canwest altered newswire stories about the Iraq war and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, such that Reuters felt it had inserted Canwest&#x27;s own bias under Reuters bylines. The changes were apparently made in accordance with a Canwest policy to label certain groups as terrorists. Ottawa Citizen, a newspaper in the Canwest chain, made similar changes to a story by Associated Press.
* Canwest editorial control and management itself. In December 2001, staff members at &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; launched a &quot;Gazette Newsroom&quot; web page with an open letter, titled &quot;Media Giant Silences Local Voices: Canadian Journalism Under Attack&quot;, that got signed by 77 Gazette journalists as of 2002 January 23, opposing the national editorial policy, and the reporters among them participated in a byline strike, refusing to sign their names to their stories in the newspaper in protest. Management responded with a gag order. The next year, several journalists left &quot;The Halifax Daily News&quot; over similar conflicts, and ten journalists at &quot;The Regina Leader-Post&quot; were reprimanded or suspended after a byline strike to protest censorship of coverage of a speech in Regina by &quot;Toronto Star&quot; columnist and Canwest critic Haroon Siddiqui.

<text>Banned in the U.S.A.: The Luke LP (later reissued as Banned in the U.S.A.) is the fourth studio album by American hip hop group 2 Live Crew, released on July 24, 1990 by Luke and Atlantic Records. Originally credited as Luke&#x27;s solo album, it included the hits &quot;Do the Bart&quot; and &quot;Banned in the U.S.A.&quot;. It was also the very first release to bear the RIAA-standard Parental Advisory warning sticker.

==Music==
The eponymous title single is a reference to the decision in a court case that 2 Live Crew&#x27;s previous album &quot;As Nasty As They Wanna Be&quot; was obscene (the decision would later be overturned on appeal). Bruce Springsteen granted the group permission to interpolate his song &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; for it.

Displeased over the decision of Florida Governor Bob Martinez who, on being asked to examine the album, decided it was obscene and recommended local law enforcement take action against it and over the subsequent action of sheriff Nick Navarro of Broward County, Florida, who arrested local record store owners on obscenity charges for selling the group&#x27;s albums and the subsequent arrest of members of the group on obscenity charges, the group included the song &quot;Fuck Martinez&quot;, which also includes multiple repetitions of the phrase &quot;fuck Navarro&quot;. The group found two other men with the same names, and had them sign releases, as they thought that this action would make it impossible for Martinez or Navarro to sue them. &quot;Fuck Martinez&quot; is not included on Spotify&#x27;s stream of &quot;Banned in the U.S.A.&quot;; however, it is included on Uncle Luke&#x27;s compilation &quot;Booty Calls &amp; Chants&quot;.

There were also VHS tape and LaserDisc releases of the group discussing the ban. The album was briefly parodied on a skit of &quot;In Living Color&quot; in which Campbell, spoofed by David Alan Grier, is challenged to compose a children&#x27;s song. Struggling to make a good song, he manages to come up with unoffensive composures until the last line where he must rhyme the word &quot;tucked&quot;. The skit is cut off by a narrator saying &quot;The following line is banned in the USA&quot;.

<text>San Salvador de Jujuy (), commonly known as Jujuy and locally often referred to as San Salvador, is the capital and largest city of Jujuy Province in northwest Argentina. Also, it is the seat of the Doctor Manuel Belgrano Department. It lies near the southern end of the Humahuaca Canyon where wooded hills meet the lowlands.

Its population at the was 237,751 inhabitants. If its suburbs are included, this figure rises to around 300,000. The current mayor is Raúl Jorge.

== City information ==
The city lies on National Route 9 that connects La Quiaca with Salta , and it is from Buenos Aires. Tourist destinations not far from the city are Tilcara , Humahuaca , and the Calilegua National Park .

Jujuy is located near the Andes, at the junction of the Xibi Xibi River and the Río Grande de Jujuy, 1,238 meters above sea level. The weather is humid during the summer and dry and cold during the winter. Temperatures vary widely between day and night. 
The city is the provincial government, financial and cultural centre.

The city has a colonial city centre including the Cabildo, the cathedral, and colorful Andean carnivals.

The Gobernador Horacio Guzmán International Airport at coordinates , is southeast of the city (in Ciudad Perico) and has regular flights to Buenos Aires.

== History ==

After previous attempts in 1565 and 1592, the current city was founded as &quot;San Salvador de Velazco en el Valle de Jujuy&quot; on April 19, 1593, by Francisco de Argañarás y Murguía. The settlement initially developed as a strategic site on the mule trade route between San Miguel de Tucumán and the silver mines in Potosí, Bolivia.

Reaching its peak importance during the colonial period, San Salvador de Jujuy declined to the status of a remote provincial capital after the Argentine Declaration of Independence in 1816. The town became the capital of Jujuy Province when the latter separated from Salta Province in 1834. The 1863 Jujuy earthquake leveled the town, and it recovered slowly in the following decades. Jujuy began to grow following the arrival of the Northern Central Railway in 1900. Its first institution of higher learning, the Economic Sciences Institute, was established in 1959, and was incorporated into the new National University of Jujuy in 1973. The city was the location of a number of Argentine films, including &quot;Veronico Cruz&quot; (1988) and &quot;Una estrella y dos cafés&quot; (2005). The city&#x27;s impoverished Lower Azopardo neighborhood would later give rise to Milagro Sala&#x27;s Indigenist Tupac Amaru Neighborhood Association.

== Climate ==
Jujuy has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), mainly because of the altitude. Summers bring warm days at and nights at with frequent thunderstorms. The rest of the year is sunny, with temperatures at about during the day and at night, crisp, dry winters with warm days of and cold nights at , and sunny springs with warm days at and cool nights at . During heat waves, temperatures can sometimes reach but these are not frequent and nights always bring significant cooling, as opposed to many low-lying areas in Northern Argentina. During the winter, the record low has fallen to . Precipitation is about , which falls in the form of thunderstorms during the warmest months. The highest temperature recorded was on October 16, 2014 while the lowest temperature recorded was on August 14, 1978.

<text>Corrientes (; Guaraní: Taragui, literally: &quot;Currents&quot;) is the capital city of the province of Corrientes, Argentina, located on the eastern shore of the Paraná River, about from Buenos Aires and from Posadas, on National Route 12. It has a population of 346,334 according to the 2010 Census. It lies opposite its twin city, Resistencia, Chaco.

Corrientes has a mix of colonial and modern architecture, several churches and a number of lapacho, ceibo, jacaranda and orange trees. It is also home to one of the biggest carnival and chamamé celebrations in the country.

The annual average temperature is . The annual rainfall is around .

== Transportation ==
Located in the Argentine Littoral, near the Argentina–Paraguay border, the General Belgrano Bridge crosses the Paraná River which serves as the natural border with the neighbouring Chaco Province. On the other side of the bridge is Resistencia, capital of Chaco. To the west and up the Paraná, between Paraguay and Argentina, lies the Yaciretá dam, one of the largest hydroelectric power generators in the world.

The Doctor Fernando Piragine Niveyro International Airport at coordinates , away from the city, serves the city.

The Ferrocarril Económico Correntino narrow gauge railway line to Mburucuyá operated from 1912 until 1927.

== History ==

Sebastian Cabot established in 1527 the &quot;Sancti Spiritu&quot; fort upstream of the Paraná River, and in 1536 Pedro de Mendoza reached further north into the basin of the river, searching for the &quot;Sierras of Silver&quot;.

Juan Torres de Vera y Aragón founded the city on April 3, 1588, and named it as &quot;San Juan de Vera de las Siete Corrientes&quot; (&quot;Saint John of Vera of the Seven Currents&quot;), which was later shortened to &quot;Corrientes&quot;. The &quot;seven currents&quot; refer to the seven peninsulas on the shore of the river at this place, that produced wild currents that made difficult the navigation of the river through this part.

Nevertheless, its position between Asunción - in present Paraguay - and Buenos Aires made it an important middle point, especially because of its 55-metre-high lands that prevent flooding when the water level rises.

In 1615 Jesuits settled near the Uruguay River. In 1807 the city resisted the British invasions. During the Argentine War of Independence it was in permanent conflict with the centralist government of Buenos Aires, but the Paraguayan War united them after the city was attacked by Paraguayan forces in 1865.

== Climate ==
The annual average temperature is . The annual rainfall is around . The Köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfa&quot; (humid subtropical climate). Frosts are rare; with the dates of the first and last frost being July 5 and July 12 respectively, indicating that most of the year is frost-free. The highest temperature recorded was on September 30, 2020, and the next day, the all-time record was broken again with . The lowest temperature ever recorded was on June 15, 1979.

<doc id="592875" wikidata="Q16968365" url="?curid=592875" title="Record Breakers">
<text>Record Breakers was a British children&#x27;s TV show, themed around world records and produced by the BBC. It was broadcast on BBC1 from 15 December 1972 to 21 December 2001.

It was originally presented by Roy Castle with Guinness World Records founders twin brothers Norris McWhirter and Ross McWhirter. The programme was a spin-off series from &quot;Blue Peter&quot; which had featured record breaking attempts overseen by the McWhirter twins. The closing theme was &quot;Dedication&quot;, performed by Roy Castle, who broke nine world records on the show himself. Producers of the series over the years were, Alan Russell (its creator), Michael Forte, Eric Rowan, Greg Childs, Annette Williams and Jeremy Daldry.

As well as interviews with people who held British or World records, early editions of the programme would include a feature in which the studio audience would test the McWhirter brothers on their (almost infallible) knowledge of records, and the climax of each show would usually be a world record attempt in the studio. Ross was murdered by a Provisional IRA gunman in 1975, but his brother continued to appear on the show in the &quot;Norris on the Spot&quot; feature.

By the time &quot;Record Breakers&quot; was cancelled, it had been on air for 29 years, 7 days and was one of the longest-running TV programmes in Britain.

==Hosts ==
Other hosts included Dilys Morgan (1973), Fiona Kennedy (1983–86), Julian Farino (1985–86), Mark Curry (1995) and Ronald Reagan Jr. (1996–97). After Castle died in 1994, the show was hosted by Baker and Akabusi, then Linford Christie took over in 1998 with co-presenters Jack Lattimer, Jez Edwards (1998–2001), Kate Gerbeau (1998) and Sally Gray (1999–2000). Fearne Cotton was the host for the final series in 2001 with Edwards and Shovell.

==Specials ==
&quot;All Star Record Breakers&quot;, which ran annually from 1974 to 1982, was a special Christmas edition of the show. Castle was joined for this extended edition by virtually all the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s TV presenters for music and dance numbers, which generally culminated with the ensemble cast performing a classic story.

<text>The Dream Cycle is a series of short stories and novellas by author H. P. Lovecraft (1890–1937). Written between 1918 and 1932, they are about the &quot;Dreamlands&quot;, a vast alternate dimension that can only be entered via dreams. The Dreamlands are described as lying deeper than space, matter and time, and are a &quot;limitless vacua beyond all thought and entity&quot;.

==Description==
The Dreamlands are divided into four regions:

* The West contains the &quot;Steps of Deeper Slumber&quot; (descended via the &quot;Cavern of Flame&quot;) and the Enchanted Woods, by which many enter the Dreamlands. Other points of interest include the port of Dylath-Leen, one of the Dreamlands&#x27; largest cities; the town of Ulthar, &quot;where no man may kill a cat&quot;; the coastal jungle city of Hlanith; and the desert trading capital Illarnek. Here lies the fabled &quot;Land of Mnar&quot;, whose gray stones are etched with signs and where rise the ruins of the great Sarnath.
* The South, home of the isle of Oriab and the areas known as the Fantastic Realms (described in &quot;The White Ship&quot;).
* The East, home of Celephaïs, a city dreamt into being by its monarch Kuranes, greatest of all recorded dreamers, and the dangerous Forbidden Lands.
* The North, location of the feared Plateau of Leng, home of man-eating spiders and the satyr-like &quot;Men of Leng&quot;.

Other locales include the Underworld, a subterranean region underneath the Dreamlands inhabited by various monsters; the Moon, accessible via a ship and inhabited by toad-like &quot;moon-beasts&quot; allied with Nyarlathotep; and Kadath, a huge castle atop a mountain and the domain of the &quot;Great Ones&quot;, the gods of Earth&#x27;s Dreamland.

Evidently all dreamers see the Dreamlands slightly differently, as Atal, High Priest of Ulthar, mentions that everyone has their own dreamland. In the same sentence he says the Dreamlands that many know is a &quot;general land of vision&quot;.

The Dreamlands are described in &quot;Hypnos&quot; as beyond anything conceivable to humans, and in which only imaginative men can dream of:Continuing on, the Dreamlands are described as limitless and beyond all thought and entity:

<doc id="592881" wikidata="Q7710764" url="?curid=592881" title="Tharg the Mighty">
<text>Tharg the Mighty or The Mighty One is the fictional editor of the British science fiction comic &quot;2000 AD&quot;. The character was introduced on the cover of the first issue in 1977 and is one of only two characters to appear in almost every issue of the comic, the other being Judge Dredd. Tharg occasionally appears in stories and strips involving him have been written by such notable writers as Alan Grant, Alan Moore and John Wagner, albeit usually credited to &quot;TMO&quot; – &quot;The Mighty One&quot;.

==Characterisation==
Tharg is depicted as an alien from Quaxxann, a fictional planet that orbits the star Betelgeuse. The character has green skin, a white mohawk hairstyle and a red device called the rosette of Sirius on his forehead. He is written and performed for comic effect as an authoritarian egoist. He eats polystyrene cups.

Tharg writes the comic&#x27;s introduction, answers letters, and doles out prizes to readers (for artwork or story suggestions) - winners could choose payment either in pounds sterling or in &quot;galactic groats&quot;. Tharg speaks mostly in English, but with various pithy Betelgusian aphorisms thrown in for colour.

In addition to the editorial duties in &quot;2000 AD&quot; being attributed to Tharg, all writing, art, lettering, sub-editing and PR is attributed to malcontent, feckless and long-suffering droids that appear as caricatures of their actual counterparts.

In one episode, a Tharg suit in the comic&#x27;s office was explained as a skin that Tharg had shed.

== Creation and concept ==
The concept of using a fictional character to host the comic is comparable to the tradition of hosts in horror comics. It was commonplace in British comics in the 1970s when &quot;2000 AD&quot; began publication. For example, &quot;Warlord&quot; was supposedly edited by Lord Peter Flint and &quot;Bullet&quot; by a character named Fireball. &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s short-lived sister title &quot;Starlord&quot; used a similar device with the eponymous alien Starlord as did &quot;Tornado&quot; with Big E.

Pat Mills created Tharg but since regrets it, in 2015 describing him as an anachronism. In 1996 David Bishop was determined to get rid of Tharg and challenge the status quo, so replaced him as host in #1014 with the &quot;Vector 13&quot; Men in Black. Reader reaction was &quot;strong and vitriolic&quot; and Tharg was reinstated in #1032. Bishop came to realise that Tharg is an intrinsic part of &quot;2000 AD&quot; and that the Men in Black were &quot;a tiresome encumbrance&quot;. Tharg&#x27;s return and the ousting of the Men in Black was covered in the &quot;Vector 13&quot; story &quot;Case Ten: Case Closed?&quot;

==&quot;2000 AD&quot; editors==

==Comic strips==
&quot;2000 AD&quot; regularly features self-contained, science-fiction short stories called &quot;Tharg&#x27;s Future Shocks&quot;. Tharg is generally characterised as the host or presenter of these one-shots. The format also sub-divides into genre-specific variants including: &quot;Tharg&#x27;s 3rillers&quot;, &quot;Tharg&#x27;s Alien Invasions&quot;, &quot;Tharg&#x27;s Dragon Tales&quot;, and &quot;Tharg&#x27;s Terror Tales&quot;.

On occasion &quot;2000 AD&quot; includes short humorous strips that feature Tharg as a character. The plots often concern Tharg&#x27;s conflict with Thrillsuckers, a plague of psychic pests that attempt to steal &quot;2000 AD&quot;&#x27;s Thrillpower, his abuse of his droid staff, and his battles against The Dictators of Zrag, rulers of the dull cube-shaped planet Zrag. This trio of incompetent alien warlords hope to usurp Tharg&#x27;s position and use the comic&#x27;s powers to revitalise their planet. Tharg uses the Dictators as convenient scapegoats whom he can blame for printing errors and plot holes.

<doc id="592890" wikidata="Q2908451" url="?curid=592890" title="Forever Delayed">
<text>Forever Delayed is a greatest hits album and DVD by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 28 October 2002 by Epic Records. The album included three singles which had never appeared on any of the band&#x27;s earlier albums (&quot;Motown Junk&quot;, &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot; and the number one hit &quot;The Masses Against the Classes&quot;), as well as two new songs, the single &quot;There by the Grace of God&quot; and &quot;Door to the River&quot;.

The album peaked and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 4.

== Content ==

The album featured two new songs: the single &quot;There by the Grace of God&quot; and &quot;Door to the River&quot;. &quot;Door to the River&quot; was originally recorded in the sessions for the &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; album, but the band deemed the song too unfitting to the album&#x27;s general style. &quot;There by the Grace of God&quot; could be seen as a foreshadowing of what followed the hits compilation, as it features a more electronic/keyboard-heavy style that would eventually be the main style of the band&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Lifeblood&quot;.

Several songs were edited for length (&quot;Motorcycle Emptiness&quot;, &quot;La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&quot;, &quot;You Love Us&quot;, &quot;Australia&quot;, &quot;From Despair to Where&quot;, &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;, &quot;Little Baby Nothing&quot; and &quot;The Everlasting&quot;) so that more tracks could fit onto the CD (though not listed as edits in the liner notes).

The title of &quot;Forever Delayed&quot; is lifted from the lyrics of their song &quot;Roses in the Hospital&quot; (which does not feature on the CD album). A song called &quot;4 Ever Delayed&quot; was recorded for inclusion but ended up not being included. Plans of releasing it as part of a new two-disc edition of the compilation and as CD single were then toyed with but never surfaced. It eventually wound up on the band&#x27;s following B-sides and rarities compilation &quot;Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers)&quot; in 2003. The title of the greatest hits package had also been planned for several years previous; band member Nicky Wire first mentioned it in Simon Price&#x27;s biography &quot;Everything – A Book About Manic Street Preachers&quot;, published in 1998.

== Release ==

The compilation album reached number 4 in the UK Albums Chart, and spent a total of 19 weeks in the Top 100. To date it has gone Double Platinum (600,000 copies) in the UK. It reached number 7 in Ireland and in Finland, and it also charted within the Top 20 in Denmark. The album has sold more than one million copies since its release in 2002.

The album was promoted by the introduction of new songs such as &quot;Door to the River&quot; and by the single &quot;There by the Grace of God&quot;, which peaked and debuted at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.

The &quot;Forever Delayed&quot; DVD was released in 2002 together with the greatest hits CD and photo book that bear the same name, and features all the promo music videos from the start of the band&#x27;s career released prior to the DVD. Along with the promo videos there is a selection of 14 remix videos, where the visual material is taken from clips of the other promo videos as well as backdrop visuals from the band&#x27;s live concerts.

== Reception ==
&quot;Forever Delayed&quot; is the first of three compilation albums by the Manic Street Preachers, and it was not well received by &quot;NME&quot; that stated: &quot;So here it is, The Album That Should Not Exist. To the slogan-smothered, soul-bruised, scarred-for-the-cause skunkpunk heroes of 1991 - the scary/beautiful freaks claiming they&#x27;ll self-destruct after one six million-selling album - this greatest hits would be musical treachery.&quot;

AllMusic rated the album with a 4 out of 5, saying: &quot;Manic Street Preachers have always been a band of very specific charms, something that has not translated outside of the U.K. particularly well. Although it boasts a generous 20 tracks, the 2002 compilation Forever Delayed isn&#x27;t likely to change that situation, even if it has the lion&#x27;s share of their big singles, since a band devoted to sloganeering doesn&#x27;t play outside of their province, or era, without some knowledge of their context.&quot;

Sputnikmusic made a track-by-track review, finishing with: &quot;Overall I&#x27;d say this is a great introduction to the Manics, but it&#x27;s nowhere near definitive. It&#x27;s missing songs too many good songs (Slash N Burn especially), and it&#x27;s far too biased towards This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours.&quot;

<text>In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem states that an everywhere-defined symmetric operator on a Hilbert space with inner product formula_1 is bounded. By definition, an operator &quot;A&quot; is &quot;symmetric&quot; if 
:formula_2
for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in the domain of &quot;A&quot;. Note that symmetric &quot;everywhere-defined&quot; operators are necessarily self-adjoint, so this theorem can also be stated as follows: an everywhere-defined self-adjoint operator is bounded. The theorem is named after Ernst David Hellinger and Otto Toeplitz. 

This theorem can be viewed as an immediate corollary of the closed graph theorem, as self-adjoint operators are closed. Alternatively, it can be argued using the uniform boundedness principle. One relies on the symmetric assumption, therefore the inner product structure, in proving the theorem. Also crucial is the fact that the given operator &quot;A&quot; is defined everywhere (and, in turn, the completeness of Hilbert spaces).

The Hellinger–Toeplitz theorem reveals certain technical difficulties in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. Observables in quantum mechanics correspond to self-adjoint operators on some Hilbert space, but some observables (like energy) are unbounded. By Hellinger–Toeplitz, such operators cannot be everywhere defined (but they may be defined on a dense subset). Take for instance the quantum harmonic oscillator. Here the Hilbert space is L2(R), the space of square integrable functions on R, and the energy operator &quot;H&quot; is defined by (assuming the units are chosen such that ℏ = &quot;m&quot; = ω = 1)
: formula_3
This operator is self-adjoint and unbounded (its eigenvalues are 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ...), so it cannot be defined on the whole of L2(R).

<text>A specialty channel (also known in the United States as a cable channel or cable network) can be a commercial broadcasting or non-commercial television channel which consists of television programming focused on a single genre, subject or targeted television market at a specific demographic.

==History==

The number of specialty channels greatly increased during the 1990s and 2000s with the increase of broadcast bandwidth and television&#x27;s transition to digital, while the previously common model of countries having just a few (national) TV stations addressing all interest groups and demographics became increasingly outmoded, as it already had been for some time in several countries. About 65% of today&#x27;s satellite channels are specialty channels . 

Types of specialty services may include, but by no means are limited to: 

* Adult channels
* Children&#x27;s interest channels
* Documentary channels
* Entertainment channels
* Men&#x27;s interest channels
* Movie channels
* Music channels
* News channels
* Public affairs (broadcasting)
* Public, educational, and government access
* Quiz channels
* Shopping channels
* Sports channels
* Religious broadcasting
* Women&#x27;s interest channels
(These categories are provided for convenience and do not necessarily represent industry-accepted or otherwise legally binding names or categories for these types of services.)

Some specialty channels may not be free-to-air or may not be available through conventional broadcast or terrestrial television, and are only distributed via multichannel television services such as cable or satellite television. In the United States, such networks are colloquially referred to as cable channels or cable networks (regardless of distribution method), with the most widely distributed referred to as &quot;basic cable&quot; networks (as opposed to those in higher service tiers, or premium services). In the U.S., specialty channels also operate as broadcast television networks designed to be carried on digital subchannels of terrestrial stations (which proliferated following the transition from analog broadcasting), which usually focus on library programming catering to specific themes, genres, or demographics.

== Canadian specialty channels ==

The term &quot;specialty channel&quot; has been used most frequently in Canada, having been used as a marketing term by the cable industry for various simultaneous launches of new channels throughout the 1990s. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) term for such a channel is specialty &quot;service&quot; (or even more explicitly &quot;specialty television programming undertaking&quot;), referring to virtually any non-premium television service which is not carried over the airwaves or otherwise deemed exempt by the CRTC. They are primarily carried, therefore, on cable television and satellite television.

The CRTC previously enforced strict regulations on the types of programming that may be carried by specialty services, employing minimums and restrictions across specific genres on a per-licence basis, and a category system granting exclusive rights to specific categories of channels. These restrictions were imposed to discourage networks from deviating from the programming format which they were licensed to broadcast. Under a deregulation scheme, the CRTC has since replaced these with streamlined, standard terms for most specialty channels (discretionary services), whose only major restrictions are on the broadcast of live sports programming. Contrarily, a service licensed as a mainstream sports network is restricted in their carriage of non-sport programming.

<text>&#x27; (provisional designation &#x27;) is a stony asteroid, classified as near-Earth object of the Apollo group and potentially hazardous asteroid, approximately 1 kilometer in diameter. It was discovered on 24 June 1998, by the LINEAR survey at the Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico.

== Description ==

 orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9–3.9 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,366 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.62 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. It is also a Mars-crossing asteroid.

Shortly after its discovery, was imaged by radar at Goldstone and Arecibo.

The study showed that the asteroid has a rotation period of 15 hours, and a shape that is roughly spherical, with some steep protrusions and large craters.

On 24 August 2013 it passed at a distance of 21.9 Lunar distances. It was hoped to be observed by Goldstone radar.

== Numbering and naming ==

This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 16 February 2003. As of 2018, it has not been named.

<text>A show trial is a public trial in which the guilt or innocence of the defendant has already been determined. The purpose of holding a show trial is to present both accusation and verdict to the public, serving as an example and a warning to other would-be dissidents or transgressors.

Show trials tend to be retributive rather than corrective, and they are also conducted for propagandistic purposes. When aimed at individuals on the basis of protected classes or characteristics, show trials are examples of political persecution. The term was first recorded in 1928.

A similar concept is &quot;kangaroo court&quot;.

== China ==
After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, show trials were given to &quot;rioters and counter-revolutionaries&quot; involved in the protests and the subsequent military massacre.

Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo was given a show trial in 2009. Chinese writer and dissident Ma Jian argued that Gu Kailai, the wife of purged Communist Chinese leader Bo Xilai, was given a show trial in 2012.

== Soviet Union ==

As early as 1922, Lenin advocated staging several &quot;model trials&quot; (&quot;показательный процесс&quot;, literally &quot;a process showing an example&quot;) in Soviet Russia and Soviet Ukraine.

Show trials became common during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s political repressions, such as the Moscow Trials of the Great Purge period (1937–38). Such trials paralleled the institution of self-criticism within Communist Party cadres and Soviet society.

Known show trials in Soviet Ukraine include &quot;Union for the Liberation of Ukraine&quot; trial (1930), (1930), &quot;&quot; trial (1931).

== Russia ==
During its full-scale invasion into Ukraine, around 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers were taken prisoners by Russia in Mariupol in May 2022. In 2023 Russia began criminal prosecutions against members of the Azov Regiment, on the charges of involvement in a terrorist organization and taking part in action to overthrow the Russia-backed authorities in the Donetsk region. Most of the Ukrainians standing trials in Russia are members of Ukrainian Armed Forces, which, according to HRW, makes them prisoners of war with corresponding status and protections per the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. According to HRW and Amnesty International, the charges are war crimes and, per HRW, are an excuse to prosecute Ukrainian soldiers for participating in the conflict. Observers called those prosecution show trials.

The trials and sentences of Evan Gershkovich, Alexei Navalny and others were described as &quot;ominously reminiscent of Soviet tactics&quot;.

== Eastern Europe ==

Following some dissent within ruling communist parties throughout the Eastern Bloc, especially after the 1948 Tito–Stalin split, several party purges occurred, with several hundred thousand members purged in several countries. In addition to rank-and-file member purges, prominent communists were purged, with some subjected to public show trials. These were more likely to be instigated, and sometimes orchestrated, by the Kremlin or even Stalin himself, as he had done in the earlier Moscow Trials.

Such high-ranking party show trials included those of Koçi Xoxe in Albania and Traicho Kostov in Bulgaria, who were purged and arrested. After Kostov was executed, Bulgarian leaders sent Stalin a telegram thanking him for the help. In Romania, Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, Ana Pauker and Vasile Luca were arrested, with Pătrășcanu being executed. The Soviets generally directed show trial methods throughout the Eastern Bloc, including a procedure in which confessions and evidence from leading witnesses could be extracted by any means, including threatening to torture the witnesses&#x27; wives and children. The higher-ranking the party member, generally the more harsh the torture that was inflicted upon him. For the show trial of Hungarian Interior Minister János Kádár, who one year earlier had attempted to force a confession of Rajk in his show trial, regarding &quot;Vladimir&quot; the questioner of Kádár:

The evidence was often not just non-existent but absurd, such as Hungarian George Paloczi-Horváth&#x27;s party interrogators claiming &quot;We knew all the time—we have it here in writing—that you met professor Szentgyörgyi not in Istanbul, but in Constantinople.&quot; In another case, the Hungarian ÁVH secret police also condemned another party member as a Nazi accomplice with a document that had been previously displayed in a glass cabinet at the Institute of the Working Class Movement as an example of a Gestapo forgery. The trials themselves were &quot;shows&quot;, with each participant having to learn a script and conduct repeated rehearsals before the performance. In the Slánský trial in Czechoslovakia, when the judge skipped one of the scripted questions, the better-rehearsed Slánský answered the one which should have been asked.

===Yugoslavia===
In 1946, Draža Mihailović and a number of other prominent figures of the Chetnik movement during World War II were tried for high treason and war crimes committed during WWII. The trial opened in the presence of about 60 foreign journalists. Mihailović and ten others (two in absentia) were sentenced to death by a firing squad; the others were convicted of penalties ranging from 18 months to 20 years in prison. In 2015, a Serbian court invalidated Mihailović&#x27;s conviction. The court held that it had been a Communist political show trial that was controlled by the government. The court concluded that Mihailović had not received a fair trial. Mihailović was, therefore, fully rehabilitated.

During 1946–1949, several well-publicized show trials were held in the People&#x27;s Republic of Slovenia. First was the Nagode Trial in which 32 non-communist intellectuals were tried as spies, three of them sentenced to death. Second was a series of so-called Dachau trials in which 37 members of the Communist Party were sentenced, 15 of them to death. In the 1940s, highly publicized show trials were employed against many real or alleged collaborators, and people with pro-Bulgarian views, who were sentenced to death for national treason, in the People&#x27;s Republic of Macedonia.

===Hungary===
Stalin&#x27;s NKVD emissary coordinated with Hungarian General Secretary Mátyás Rákosi and his ÁVH head the way the show trial of Hungarian Minister of Interior László Rajk should go, and he was later executed.

===Czechoslovakia===
The Rajk trials in Hungary led Moscow to warn Czechoslovakia&#x27;s parties that enemy agents had penetrated even high into party ranks, and when a puzzled Rudolf Slánský and Klement Gottwald inquired what they could do, Stalin&#x27;s NKVD agents arrived to help prepare subsequent trials.

First, these trials focused on people outside the Czechoslovak Communist party. General Heliodor Píka was arrested without a warrant in early May 1948 and accused of espionage and high treason, damaging the interests of the Czechoslovak Republic and the Soviet Union, and undermining the ability of the state to defend itself, Píka was not allowed to present a defence, and no witnesses were called. He was sentenced to death and hanged. During the Prague Spring of 1968, Píka&#x27;s case was reopened at the request of Milan Píka (son of Heliodor) and the elder Píka&#x27;s lawyer, and a military tribunal declared Heliodor Píka innocent of all charges.

Milada Horáková, a Czech politician focused on social issues and women&#x27;s rights, who was jailed during the German occupation for her political activity, was accused of leading a conspiracy to commit treason and espionage at the behest of the United States, Great Britain, France and Yugoslavia. Evidence of the alleged conspiracy included Horáková&#x27;s presence at a meeting of political figures from the National Socialist, Social Democrat and People&#x27;s parties, in September 1948, held to discuss their response to the new political situation in Czechoslovakia. She was also accused of maintaining contacts with Czechoslovak political figures in exile in the West. The trial of Horáková and twelve of her colleagues began on 31 May 1950 and the State&#x27;s prosecutors were led by Dr. Josef Urválek and included Ludmila Brožová-Polednová. The trial proceedings were carefully orchestrated with confessions of guilt secured from the accused, though a recording of the event, discovered in 2005, revealed Horáková&#x27;s defence of her political ideals. Horáková was sentenced to death, along with three co-defendants (Jan Buchal, Oldřich Pecl, and Záviš Kalandra), on 8 June 1950. Many prominent figures in the West, notably Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill and Eleanor Roosevelt, petitioned for her life, but the sentences were confirmed. She was executed by hanging in Prague&#x27;s Pankrác Prison on 27 June 1950.

The trials then turned to the communist party itself (Slánský trial). In November 1952 Rudolf Slánský and 13 other high-ranking Communist bureaucrats (Bedřich Geminder, Ludvík Frejka, Josef Frank, Vladimír Clementis, Bedřich Reicin, Karel Šváb, Rudolf Margolius, Otto Šling, André Simone, Artur London, Vavro Hajdů and Evžen Löbl), 10 of whom were Jews, were arrested and charged with being Titoists and Zionists, official USSR rhetoric having turned against Zionism. Party rhetoric asserted that Slánský was spying as part of an international western capitalist conspiracy to undermine socialism and that punishing him would avenge the Nazi murders of Czech communists Jan Šverma and Julius Fučík during World War II. The trial of the 14 national leaders began on 20 November 1952, in the Senate of the State Court, with the prosecutor being Josef Urválek. It lasted eight days. It was notable for its strong anti-Semitic overtones. All were found guilty, with three being sentenced to life imprisonment while the rest were sentenced to death. Slánský was hanged at Pankrác Prison on 3 December 1952. His body was cremated and the ashes were scattered on an icy road outside of Prague.

== Western Europe ==
=== Nazi Germany ===

Between 1933 and 1945, Nazi Germany established a large number of Sondergerichte that were frequently used to prosecute those hostile to the regime. The People&#x27;s Court was a kangaroo court established in 1934 to handle political crimes, after several of the defendants at the Reichstag fire Trial were acquitted. Between 1933 and 1945, an estimated 12,000 Germans were killed on the orders of the &quot;special courts&quot; set up by the Nazi regime.
==Iran==
In the current Iranian regime there are no juries in Islamic Revolutionary Courts – trial by peers only exists in some special courts – with verdicts set before the trial. Trials have on several occasions been labeled as show trials due to their proceedings.

<text>An osteoclast () is a type of bone cell that breaks down bone tissue. This function is critical in the maintenance, repair, and remodeling of bones of the vertebral skeleton. The osteoclast disassembles and digests the composite of hydrated protein and mineral at a molecular level by secreting acid and a collagenase, a process known as &quot;bone resorption&quot;. This process also helps regulate the level of blood calcium.

Osteoclasts are found on those surfaces of bone that are undergoing resorption. On such surfaces, the osteoclasts are seen to be located in shallow depressions called &quot;resorption bays (Howship&#x27;s lacunae)&quot;. The resorption bays are created by the erosive action of osteoclasts on the underlying bone. The border of the lower part of an osteoclast exhibits finger-like processes due to the presence of deep infoldings of the cell membrane; this border is called &quot;ruffled border&quot;. The ruffled border lies in contact with the bone surface within a resorption bay. The periphery of the ruffled border is surrounded by a ring-like zone of cytoplasm which is devoid of cell organelles but is rich in actin filaments. This zone is called &quot;clear zone&quot; or &quot;sealing zone&quot;. The actin filaments enable the cell membrane surrounding the sealing zone to be anchored firmly to the bony wall of Howship&#x27;s lacunae. In this way, a closed subosteoclastic compartment is created between the ruffled border and the bone that is undergoing resorption. The osteoclasts secrete hydrogen ions, collagenase, cathepsin K and hydrolytic enzymes into this compartment. Resorption of bone matrix by the osteoclasts involves two steps: (1) dissolution of inorganic components (minerals), and (2) digestion of organic component of the bone matrix. The osteoclasts pump hydrogen ions into &quot;subosteoclastic compartment&quot; and thus create an acidic microenvironment, which increases solubility of bone mineral, resulting in the release and re-entry of bone minerals into the cytoplasm of osteoclasts to be delivered to nearby capillaries. After the removal of minerals, collagenase and gelatinase are secreted into the subosteoclastic compartment. These enzymes digest and degrade collagen and other organic components of decalcified bone matrix. The degradation products are phagocytosed by osteoclasts at the ruffled border. Because of their phagocytic properties, osteoclasts are considered to be a component of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). The activity of osteoclasts is controlled by hormones and cytokines. Calcitonin, a hormone of thyroid gland, suppresses the osteoclastic activity. The osteoclasts do not have receptors for parathyroid hormone (PTH). However, PTH stimulates the osteoblasts to secrete the cytokine called osteoclast-stimulating factor, which is a potent stimulator of the osteoclastic activity.

An odontoclast (/odon·to·clast/; o-don´to-klast) is an osteoclast associated with absorption of the roots of deciduous teeth.

==Structure==
An osteoclast is a large multinucleated cell and human osteoclasts on bone typically have four nuclei and are 150–200 μm in diameter. When osteoclast-inducing cytokines are used to convert macrophages to osteoclasts, very large cells that may reach 100 μm in diameter occur. These may have dozens of nuclei, and typically express major osteoclast proteins but have significant differences from cells in living bone because of the not-natural substrate. The size of the multinucleated assembled osteoclast allows it to focus the ion transport, protein secretory and vesicular transport capabilities of many macrophages on a localized area of bone.

=== Location ===
In bone, osteoclasts are found in pits in the bone surface which are called resorption bays, or Howship&#x27;s lacunae. Osteoclasts are characterized by a cytoplasm with a homogeneous, &quot;foamy&quot; appearance. This appearance is due to a high concentration of vesicles and vacuoles. These vacuoles include lysosomes filled with acid phosphatase. This permits characterization of osteoclasts by their staining for high expression of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K. Osteoclast rough endoplasmic reticulum is sparse, and the Golgi complex is extensive.

At a site of active bone resorption, the osteoclast forms a specialized cell membrane, the &quot;ruffled border&quot;, that opposes the surface of the bone tissue. This extensively folded or ruffled border facilitates bone removal by dramatically increasing the cell surface for secretion and uptake of the resorption compartment contents and is a morphologic characteristic of an osteoclast that is actively resorbing bone.

==Development==
Since their discovery in 1873 there has been considerable debate about their origin. Three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and osteoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. After years of controversy it is now clear that these cells develop from the self fusion of macrophages. It was in the beginning of 1980 that the monocyte phagocytic system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts. Osteoclast formation requires the presence of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) and M-CSF (Macrophage colony-stimulating factor). These membrane-bound proteins are produced by neighbouring stromal cells and osteoblasts, thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast precursors.

M-CSF acts through its receptor on the osteoclast, c-fms (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase-receptor, leading to secondary messenger activation of tyrosine kinase Src. Both of these molecules are necessary for osteoclastogenesis and are widely involved in the differentiation of monocyte/macrophage derived cells.

RANKL is a member of the tumour necrosis family (TNF), and is essential in osteoclastogenesis. RANKL knockout mice exhibit a phenotype of osteopetrosis and defects of tooth eruption, along with an absence or deficiency of osteoclasts. RANKL activates NF-κβ (nuclear factor-κβ) and NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1) through RANK. NF-κβ activation is stimulated almost immediately after RANKL-RANK interaction occurs and is not upregulated. NFATc1 stimulation, however, begins ~24–48 hours after binding occurs and its expression has been shown to be RANKL dependent.

Osteoclast differentiation is inhibited by osteoprotegerin (OPG), which is produced by osteoblasts and binds to RANKL thereby preventing interaction with RANK. While osteoclasts are derived from the hematopoietic lineage, osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells.

==Function==

Once activated, osteoclasts move to areas of microfracture in the bone by chemotaxis. Osteoclasts lie in small cavities called Howship&#x27;s lacunae, formed from the digestion of the underlying bone. The sealing zone is the attachment of the osteoclast&#x27;s plasma membrane to the underlying bone. Sealing zones are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called podosomes. Attachment to the bone matrix is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as αvβ3, via the specific amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp in bone matrix proteins, such as osteopontin. The osteoclast releases hydrogen ions through the action of carbonic anhydrase (H2O + CO2 → HCO3− + H+) through the &quot;ruffled border&quot; into the resorptive cavity, acidifying and aiding dissolution of the mineralized bone matrix into Ca2+, H3PO4, H2CO3, water and other substances. Dysfunction of the carbonic anhydrase has been documented to cause some forms of osteopetrosis. Hydrogen ions are pumped against a high concentration gradient by proton pumps, specifically a unique vacuolar-ATPase. This enzyme has been targeted in the prevention of osteoporosis. In addition, several hydrolytic enzymes, such as members of the cathepsin and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) groups, are released to digest the organic components of the matrix. These enzymes are released into the compartment by lysosomes. Of these hydrolytic enzymes, cathepsin K is of most importance.

===Cathepsin K and other cathepsins===
Cathepsin K is a collagenolytic papain-like cysteine protease that is mainly expressed in osteoclasts, and is secreted into the resorptive pit. Cathepsin K is the major protease involved in the degradation of type I collagen and other noncollagenous proteins. Mutations in the cathepsin K gene are associated with pycnodysostosis, a hereditary osteopetrotic disease, characterised by a lack of functional cathepsin K expression. Knockout studies of cathepsin K in mice lead to an osteopetrotic phenotype, which, is partially compensated by increased expression of proteases other that cathepsin K and enhanced osteoclastogenesis.

Cathepsin K has an optimal enzymatic activity in acidic conditions. It is synthesized as a proenzyme with a molecular weight of 37kDa, and upon activation by autocatalytic cleavage, is transformed into the mature, active form with a molecular weight of ~27kDa.

Upon polarization of the osteoclast over the site of resorption, cathepsin K is secreted from the ruffled border into the resorptive pit. Cathepsin K transmigrates across the ruffled border by intercellular vesicles and is then released by the functional secretory domain. Within these intercellular vesicles, cathepsin K, along with reactive oxygen species generated by TRAP, further degrades the bone extracellular matrix.

Several other cathepsins are expressed in osteoclasts including cathepsins B, C, D, E, G, and L. The function of these cysteine and aspartic proteases is generally unknown within bone, and they are expressed at much lower levels than cathepsin K.

Studies on cathepsin L knockout mice have been mixed, with a report of reduced trabecular bone in homozygous and heterozygous cathepsin L knockout mice compared to wild-type and another report finding no skeletal abnormalities.

===Matrix metalloproteinases===
The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) comprise a family of more than 20 zinc-dependent endopeptidases. The role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in osteoclast biology is ill-defined, but in other tissue they have been linked with tumor promoting activities, such as activation of growth factors and are required for tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.

MMP9 is associated with the bone microenvironment. It is expressed by osteoclasts, and is known to be required for osteoclast migration and is a powerful gelatinase. Transgenic mice lacking MMP-9 develop defects in bone development, intraosseous angiogenesis, and fracture repair.

MMP-13 is believed to be involved in bone resorption and in osteoclast differentiation, as knockout mice revealed decreased osteoclast numbers, osteopetrosis, and decreased bone resorption.

MMPs expressed by the osteoclast include MMP-9, -10, -12, and -14. apart from MMP-9, little is known about their relevance to the osteoclast, however, high levels of MMP-14 are found at the sealing zone.

=== Osteoclast physiology ===
In the 1980s and 90s the physiology of typical osteoclasts was studied in detail. With the isolation of the ruffled border, ion transport across it was studied directly in biochemical detail. Energy-dependent acid transport was verified and the postulated proton pump purified. With the successful culture of osteoclasts, it became apparent that they are organized to support the massive transport of protons for acidification of the resorption compartment and solubilization of the bone mineral. This includes ruffled border Cl− permeability to control membrane potential and basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchange to maintain cytosolic pH in physiologically acceptable ranges.

The effectiveness of its ion secretion depends upon the osteoclast forming an effective seal around the resorption compartment. The positioning of this &quot;sealing zone&quot; appears to be mediated by integrins expressed on the osteoclast surface. With the sealing zone in place, the multinucleated osteoclast reorganizes itself. Developing the highly invaginated ruffled membrane apposing the resorption compartment allows massive secretory activity. In addition, it permits the vesicular transcytosis of the mineral and degraded collagen from the ruffled border to the free membrane of the cell, and its release into the extracellular compartment. This activity completes the bone resorption, and both the mineral components and collagen fragments are released to the general circulation.

=== Regulation ===
Osteoclasts are regulated by several hormones, including parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid gland, calcitonin from the thyroid gland, and growth factor interleukin 6 (IL-6). This last hormone, IL-6, is one of the factors in the disease osteoporosis. Osteoporosis occurs when there is an imbalance between the bone resorption activities of osteoclasts and the bone formation activities of osteoblasts.

Osteoclast activity is also mediated by the interaction of two molecules produced by osteoblasts, namely osteoprotegerin and RANK ligand. These molecules also regulate differentiation of the osteoclast.

==Odontoclast==
An odontoclast is an osteoclast associated with absorption of the roots of deciduous teeth.

==Alternate use of term==
An osteoclast can also be an instrument used to fracture and reset bones (the origin is Greek &quot;osteon&quot;: bone and &quot;klastos&quot;: broken). To avoid confusion, the cell was originally termed osotoclast. When the surgical instrument went out of use, the cell became known by its present name.

== Clinical significance ==
Giant osteoclasts can occur in some diseases, including Paget&#x27;s disease of bone and bisphosphonate toxicity.

In cats, abnormal odontoclast activity can cause feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions, necessitating extraction of the affected teeth.

Osteoclasts play a major role in orthodontic tooth movement and pathologic migration of periodontally compromised teeth.

== History ==
Osteoclasts were discovered by Kölliker in 1873.

<text>The swing era (also frequently referred to as the big band era) was the period (1933–1947) when big band swing music was the most popular music in the United States, especially for teenagers. Though this was its most popular period, the music had actually been around since the late 1920s and early 1930s, being played by black bands led by such artists as Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Bennie Moten, Cab Calloway, Earl Hines, and Fletcher Henderson, and white bands from the 1920s led by the likes of Jean Goldkette, Russ Morgan and Isham Jones. An early milestone in the era was from &quot;the King of Swing&quot; Benny Goodman&#x27;s performance at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles on August 21, 1935, bringing the music to the rest of the country. The 1930s also became the era of other great soloists: the tenor saxophonists Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster and Lester Young; the alto saxophonists Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges; the drummers Chick Webb, Gene Krupa, Jo Jones and Sid Catlett; the pianists Fats Waller and Teddy Wilson; the trumpeters Louis Armstrong, Roy Eldridge, Bunny Berigan, and Rex Stewart.

Developments in dance orchestras and jazz music culminated in swing music during the early 1930s. It brought to fruition ideas originated with Louis Armstrong, Earl Hines, Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, and Jean Goldkette. The swing era also was precipitated by spicing up familiar commercial, popular material with a Harlem-oriented flavor and selling it via a white band for a white musical/commercial audience.[3] In Benny Goodman&#x27;s band, the most diversified styles flowed together: the ensemble style developed by Fletcher Henderson, who arranged for Goodman; the riff technique of Kansas City; and the precision and training of many white musicians. On the other hand, the easy melodic quality and clean intonation of Goodman&#x27;s band made it possible to &quot;sell&quot; jazz to a mass audience.[4]

The swing era brought to swing music Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, and by 1938 Ella Fitzgerald. Armstrong, who had heavily influenced jazz as its greatest soloist in the 1920s when working with both small bands and larger ones, now appeared only with big swing bands. Other musicians who rose during this time include Jimmy Dorsey, his brother Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Goodman&#x27;s future rival Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, who departed the Isham Jones band in 1936 to start his own band. Several factors led to the demise of the swing era: the 1942–1944 musicians&#x27; strike from August 1942 to November 1944 (the union that most jazz musicians belonged to told its members not to record until the record companies agreed to pay them each time their music was played on the radio), the earlier ban of ASCAP songs from radio stations, World War II which made it harder for bands to travel around as well as the &quot;cabaret tax&quot;, which was as high as 30%, the rise of vocalist-centered pop and R&amp;B as the dominant forms of popular music, and the rising interest in bebop among jazz musicians. Though some big bands survived through the late 1940s (Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Stan Kenton, Boyd Raeburn, Woody Herman), most of their competitors were forced to disband, bringing the swing era to a close. Big-band jazz would experience a resurgence starting in the mid-1950s, but it would never attain the same popularity as it had during the swing era.

==Musical elements==
===Beat===
During the 1920s the older two-beat style of jazz was superseded by four-beat jazz, facilitated by replacement of the sousaphone with the string bass. Four beat rhythm was the foundation of the Chicago style jazz developed by Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines, and of the swing era rhythmic styles. The change in rhythm started first with solo pianists and small ensembles, then larger ensembles towards the end of the decade. Toward the end of the twenties the two-beat styles seemed all but exhausted. First in Chicago, then in Harlem and Kansas City, a new way of playing developed around 1928–29. Chicago musicians migrating to Harlem brought their rhythmic ideas with them. As is so often the case in jazz, there are confusing exceptions to this general outline. Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s big band at the height of the swing era employed a beat that was simultaneously 2/4 and 4/4. The Bob Crosby Orchestra and the Lionel Hampton Orchestra also featured two-beat rhythms long after four-beat rhythm became the standard.

===Rhythm sections===
In May 1935, the No. 1 record in the country was Jimmie Lunceford&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm Is Our Business&quot;. Released a few months before Benny Goodman triggered the national craze known as swing, the song offered a foretaste of the coming deluge. &quot;Rhythm is our business/ Rhythm is what we sell,&quot; Lunceford&#x27;s singer declared: &quot;Rhythm is our business / Business sure is swell.&quot;[7] If rhythm defined the swing bands, its foundation lay in the rhythm section: piano, guitar, bass, and drums.

In big bands, rhythm sections fused into a unified rhythmic front: supplying the beat and marking the harmonies. Each of the leading bands presented a distinct, well-designed rhythmic attack that complemented its particular style. The rhythm sections of Ellington, Basie, and Lunceford, for example, sounded nothing alike. Just as the soloists were champing at the bit of big-band constraints, rhythm players were developing techniques and ideas that demanded more attention than they usually received. In the 1930s, rhythm instruments made dramatic advances toward the foreground of jazz. In the process, they helped set the stage for bebop. In 1939, Duke Ellington discovered virtuoso young bassist Jimmie Blanton and hired him into his Orchestra. Blanton revolutionized the bass as a featured instrument in the band, until he left the band in late 1941 due to terminal tuberculosis.

Towards the end of the 1930s the roles of the piano, bass, and drums in the rhythm section changed significantly under the influence of the Count Basie Orchestra Early swing drumming relied heavily on the bass and snare drums, with a secondary role for the high hat cymbal in timekeeping. Jo Jones inverted that relationship, making the high hat the primary timekeeper and using the bass and snare drums for accents and lead-ins. Basie introduced a rhythmically sparse style of piano playing emphasizing accents, lead-ins, and fills. Both of those changes increased the importance of the bass and guitar in timekeeping, ably held by Walter Page and Freddie Green. The lighter and sparser, yet more dynamic, sense of rhythm expressed by the Basie rhythm section lent greater freedom for the band&#x27;s soloists and set a trend that would culminate in the rhythmic ideas of bebop.

===Instruments===
To help bands adjust to the new groove, major changes were made in the rhythm section. While the bass drum continued to play a rock-solid four beat pulse, the tuba, commonly used in large dance bands of the 1920s, was replaced by the string bass. During the early years of recording, the tuba was able to project a clear, huffing sound. But the string bass had been replacing the tuba over the rhythmic devices available with it and many players, including Wellman Braud with Duke Ellington&#x27;s band, showed that the instrument had a special percussive flavor when the strings were given a pizzicato &quot;slap&quot; (plucked rather than bowed). Change came gradually in the late 1920s, once word had gotten around about how well the string bass worked; many tuba players realized that they&#x27;d better switch instruments or lose their jobs. With Walter Page&#x27;s bass replacing the tuba in Bennie Moten&#x27;s Kansas City Orchestra, the way was laid clear for the band to develop the kinetic style of swing it would show under the leadership of Count Basie.

The banjo, with its loud and raucous tone, was replaced with the guitar, which provided a more subtle and secure pulsation (chunk-chunk) in the foundation rhythm. As the saying went, the guitar was more felt than heard. Listeners felt the combined sound of bass, guitar, and drums as a sonic force that pushed through cavernous dance halls. &quot;If you were on the first floor, and the dance hall was upstairs,&quot; Count Basie remembered, &quot;that was what you would hear, that steady rump, rump, rump, rump in that medium tempo.&quot;

As often noted by commentators on jazz history, the swing era saw the saxophone supersede in many ways the trumpet as the dominant jazz solo instrument. Swing arrangements often emphasized the reed section to carry the melody, with trumpets providing accents and highlights. For this reason the types of solo improvisations would change dramatically during the thirties. Trumpeter Roy Eldridge deviated from the more common Armstrong-influenced styles towards a style of improvisation resembling that of reed players, and in turn would be an early influence on bebop trumpet pioneer Dizzy Gillespie. Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter broke the barrier to early acceptance of the saxophone as a jazz instrument but it was the style of Frankie Trumbauer on C melody sax, showcased in the recordings he did with Bix Beiderbecke in 1927, that laid the groundwork for the style of saxophone playing that would make it a dominant influence on soloing styles. Lester Young, whose influence on saxophone playing became dominant towards the end of the 1930s, cited Trumbauer&#x27;s linear, melodic approach to improvisation as his main inspiration for his own style.

The Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in 1927 consisted of two trumpets, two trombones, three reeds, piano, banjo, tuba, and drums. The Goodman band in 1935 had three trumpets, two trombones, the leader&#x27;s clarinet, two alto saxes, two tenor saxes, piano, guitar, bass, and drums, fourteen pieces in all, compared to Henderson&#x27;s eleven in the earlier days. The piano-guitar-bass-drums rhythm section had become standard and kept a steady and uncluttered beat that was very easy to follow. Goodman was quite skilled at setting the perfect dance tempo for each song while alternating wild &quot;killer dillers&quot; with slower ballads. In addition to Henderson and his younger brother Horace, Goodman employed top arrangers such as Fletcher Henderson, Jimmy Mundy, Deane Kincaide, Edgar Sampson, and Spud Murphy who put the melody first but included rhythmic figures in their charts and wrote arrangements that built to a logical climax. Mundy and Sampson had previously done arranging for Earl Hines and Chick Webb, respectively. In 1935, Goodman did not have many major soloists in his band. Unlike Duke Ellington, who went out of his way to hire unique individualists, and Count Basie, who came from a Kansas City tradition emphasizing soloists, Goodman was most concerned that his musicians read music perfectly, blended together naturally, and did not mind being subservient to the leader. It was the sound of the ensembles, the swinging rhythm section, and the leader&#x27;s fluent clarinet that proved to be irresistible to his young and eager listeners.

===Arranging===
To fit the new groove, dance-band arranging became more inventive. To some extent, this was a belated influence of Louis Armstrong, whose rhythms continued to be absorbed by soloists and arrangers through the 1930s. Arrangers learned to write elaborate lines for an entire section, harmonized in block chords, called soli. They were conversant with chromatic (complex) harmony and knew how to make the most of their flexible orchestra.

Arrangements could also arise spontaneously out of oral practice. But even in New York, where bands prided themselves on their musical literacy, musicians could take improvised riffs and harmonize them on the spot. The result, known as a head arrangement, was a flexible, unwritten arrangement created by the entire band. One musician compared it to child&#x27;s play—&quot;a lot of kids playing in the mud, having a big time.&quot;

Both kinds of arrangements, written and unwritten, could be heard in the hundreds of recordings made in the 1930s by Fletcher Henderson. For flashy pieces, Henderson relied on experienced arrangers, from his brother Horace to Don Redman and Benny Carter. But his biggest hits emerged from the bandstand. One was &quot;Sugar Foot Stomp&quot;, derived in the early 1920s from the King Oliver tune &quot;Dippermouth Blues&quot; and still in the repertory. By the 1930s, it had evolved into a thoroughly up-to-date dance tune, with a faster tempo to match the tastes of the dancers. Another hit was &quot;King Porter Stomp&quot;, a ragtime piece by Jelly Roll Morton that became radically simplified, shedding its two-beat clumsiness and march/ragtime form as it went. Many of these pieces were ultimately written down by Henderson, who became his band&#x27;s chief arranger. His genius for rhythmic swing and melodic simplicity was so effective that his music became the standard for numerous swing arrangers. Henderson was fond of short, memorable riffs—simple, bluesy phrases—in call and response: saxophones responding to trumpets, for example. In some passages, he distorted the melody into ingenious new rhythmic shapes, often in staccato (detached) bursts that opened up space for the rhythm section. Henderson was shrewd and efficient. He wrote only a few choice choruses, leaving the remainder of the arrangement open for solos accompanied by discreet, long-held chords or short riffs. As each piece headed toward its climax, the band erupted in an ecstatic wail.

<doc id="592935" wikidata="Q3304359" url="?curid=592935" title="Secure channel">
<text>In cryptography, a secure channel is a means of data transmission that is resistant to overhearing and tampering. A confidential channel is a means of data transmission that is resistant to overhearing, or eavesdropping (e.g., reading the content), but not necessarily resistant to tampering (i.e., manipulating the content). An authentic channel is a means of data transmission that is resistant to tampering but not necessarily resistant to overhearing.

In contrast to a secure channel, an insecure channel is unencrypted and may be subject to eavesdropping and tampering. Secure communications are possible over an insecure channel if the content to be communicated is encrypted prior to transmission.

==Secure channels in the real world==

There are no perfectly secure channels in the real world. There are, at best, only ways to make insecure channels (e.g., couriers, homing pigeons, diplomatic bags, etc.) less insecure: padlocks (between courier wrists and a briefcase), loyalty tests, security investigations, and guns for courier personnel, diplomatic immunity for diplomatic bags, and so forth.

In 1976, two researchers proposed a key exchange technique (now named after them)—Diffie–Hellman key exchange (D-H). This protocol allows two parties to generate a key only known to them, under the assumption that a certain mathematical problem (e.g., the Diffie–Hellman problem in their proposal) is computationally infeasible (i.e., very very hard) to solve, and that the two parties have access to an authentic channel. In short, that an eavesdropper—conventionally termed &#x27;Eve&#x27;, who can listen to all messages exchanged by the two parties, but who can not modify the messages—will not learn the exchanged key. Such a key exchange was impossible with any previously known cryptographic schemes based on symmetric ciphers, because with these schemes it is necessary that the two parties exchange a secret key at some prior time, hence they require a confidential channel at that time which is just what we are attempting to build.

Most cryptographic techniques are trivially breakable if keys are not exchanged securely or, if they actually were so exchanged, if those keys become known in some other way— burglary or extortion, for instance. An actually secure channel will not be required if an insecure channel can be used to securely exchange keys, and if burglary, bribery, or threat aren&#x27;t used. The eternal problem has been and of course remains—even with modern key exchange protocols—how to know when an insecure channel worked securely (or alternatively, and perhaps more importantly, when it did not), and whether anyone has actually been bribed or threatened or simply lost a notebook (or a notebook computer) with key information in it. These are hard problems in the real world and no solutions are known—only expedients, jury rigs, and workarounds.

==Future possibilities==

Researchers have proposed and demonstrated quantum cryptography in order to create a secure channel. 
It is not clear whether the special conditions under which it can be made to work are practical in the real world of noise, dirt, and imperfection in which most everything is required to function. Thus far, actual implementation of the technique is exquisitely finicky and expensive, limiting it to very special purpose applications. It may also be vulnerable to attacks specific to particular implementations and imperfections in the optical components of which the quantum cryptographic equipment is built. While implementations of classical cryptographic algorithms have received worldwide scrutiny over the years, only a limited amount of public research has been done to assess security of the present-day implementations of quantum cryptosystems, mostly because they are not in widespread use as of 2014.

==Modeling a secure channel==
Security definitions for a secure channel try to model its properties independently from its concrete instantiation. A good understanding of these properties is needed before designing a secure channel, and before being able to assess its appropriateness of employment in a cryptographic protocol. This is a topic of provable security. A definition of a secure channel that remains secure, even when used in arbitrary cryptographic protocols is an important building block for universally composable cryptography.

A universally composable authenticated channel can be built using digital signatures and a public key infrastructure.

Universally composable confidential channels are known to exist under computational hardness assumptions based on hybrid encryption and a public key infrastructure.

<text>Pharmacognosy is the study of crude drugs obtained from medicinal plants, animals, fungi, and other natural sources. The American Society of Pharmacognosy defines pharmacognosy as &quot;the study of the physical, chemical, biochemical, and biological properties of drugs, drug substances, or potential drugs or drug substances of natural origin as well as the search for new drugs from natural sources&quot;.

== Description ==
The word &quot;pharmacognosy&quot; is derived from two Greek words: , (drug), and &quot;gnosis&quot; (knowledge) or the Latin verb &quot;cognosco&quot; (, &#x27;with&#x27;, and , &#x27;know&#x27;; itself a cognate of the Greek verb , , meaning &#x27;I know, perceive&#x27;), meaning &#x27;to conceptualize&#x27; or &#x27;to recognize&#x27;. 

The term &quot;pharmacognosy&quot; was used for the first time by the German physician Johann Adam Schmidt (1759–1809) in his published book &quot;Lehrbuch der Materia Medica&quot; in 1811, and by Anotheus Seydler in 1815, in his &quot;Analecta Pharmacognostica&quot;.

Originally—during the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century—&quot;pharmacognosy&quot; was used to define the branch of medicine or commodity sciences (&#x27; in German) which deals with drugs in their crude, or unprepared form. Crude drugs are the dried, unprepared material of plant, animal or mineral origin, used for medicine. The study of these materials under the name &#x27; was first developed in German-speaking areas of Europe, while other language areas often used the older term &quot;materia medica&quot; taken from the works of Galen and Dioscorides. In German, the term &quot;&quot; (&quot;science of crude drugs&quot;) is also used synonymously.

As late as the beginning of the 20th century, the subject had developed mainly on the botanical side, being particularly concerned with the description and identification of drugs both in their whole state and in powder form. Such branches of pharmacognosy are still of fundamental importance, particularly for botanical products (widely available as dietary supplements in the U.S. and Canada), quality control purposes, pharmacopoeial protocols and related health regulatory frameworks. At the same time, development in other areas of research has enormously expanded the subject. The advent of the 21st century brought a renaissance of pharmacognosy, and its conventional botanical approach has been broadened up to molecular and metabolomic levels.

In addition to the previously mentioned definition, the American Society of Pharmacognosy defines pharmacognosy as &quot;the study of natural product molecules (typically secondary metabolites) that are useful for their medicinal, ecological, gustatory, or other functional properties.&quot; Similarly, the mission of the Pharmacognosy Institute at the University of Illinois at Chicago involves plant-based and plant-related health products for the benefit of human health. Other definitions are more encompassing, drawing on a broad spectrum of biological subjects, including botany, ethnobotany, marine biology, microbiology, herbal medicine, chemistry, biotechnology, phytochemistry, pharmacology, pharmaceutics, clinical pharmacy, and pharmacy practice.

* medical ethnobotany: the study of traditional uses of plants for medicinal purposes;
*ethnopharmacology: the study of pharmacological qualities of traditional medicinal substances;
* phytotherapy: the study of medicinal use of plant extracts;
*phytochemistry: the study of chemicals derived from plants (including the identification of new drug candidates derived from plant sources);
*zoopharmacognosy: the process by which animals self-medicate, by selecting and using plants, soils, and insects to treat and prevent disease;
*marine pharmacognosy: the study of chemicals derived from marine organisms.

== Biological background ==

All plants produce chemical compounds as part of their normal metabolic activities. These phytochemicals are divided into (1) primary metabolites such as sugars and fats, which are found in all plants; and (2) secondary metabolites—compounds which are found in a smaller range of plants, serving more specific functions. For example, some secondary metabolites are toxins used by plants to deter predation and others are pheromones used to attract insects for pollination. It is these secondary metabolites and pigments that can have therapeutic actions in humans and which can be refined to produce drugs—examples are inulin from the roots of dahlias, quinine from the cinchona, THC and CBD from the flowers of cannabis, morphine and codeine from the poppy, and digoxin from the foxglove.

Plants synthesize a variety of phytochemicals, but most are derivatives:
* Alkaloids are a class of chemical compounds containing a nitrogen ring. Alkaloids are produced by a large variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, and are part of the group of natural products (also called secondary metabolites). Many alkaloids can be purified from crude extracts by acid-base extraction. Many alkaloids are toxic to other organisms.
* Polyphenols ( phenolics) are compounds that contain phenol rings. The anthocyanins that give grapes their purple color, the isoflavones, the phytoestrogens from soy and the tannins that give tea its astringency are phenolics.
* Glycosides are molecules in which a sugar is bound to a non-carbohydrate moiety, usually a small organic molecule. Glycosides play numerous important roles in living organisms. Many plants store chemicals in the form of inactive glycosides. These can be activated by enzyme hydrolysis, which causes the sugar part to be broken off, making the chemical available for use.
* Terpenes are a large and diverse class of organic compounds, produced by a variety of plants, particularly conifers, which are often strong smelling and thus may have a protective function. They are the major components of resins, and of turpentine produced from resins. When terpenes are modified chemically, such as by oxidation or rearrangement of the carbon skeleton, the resulting compounds are generally referred to as &quot;terpenoids&quot;. Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary constituents of the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. Essential oils are used widely as natural flavor additives for food, as fragrances in perfumery, and in traditional and alternative medicines such as aromatherapy. Synthetic variations and derivatives of natural terpenes and terpenoids also greatly expand the variety of aromas used in perfumery and flavors used in food additives. The fragrance of rose and lavender is due to monoterpenes. The carotenoids produce shades of red, yellow and orange in pumpkin, maize, and tomatoes.

=== Natural products chemistry ===
A typical protocol to isolate a pure chemical agent from natural origin is bioassay-guided fractionation, meaning step-by-step separation of extracted components based on differences in their physicochemical properties, and assessing the biological activity, followed by next round of separation and assaying. Typically, such work is initiated after a given crude drug formulation (typically prepared by solvent extraction of the natural material) is deemed &quot;active&quot; in a particular &quot;in vitro&quot; assay. If the end-goal of the work at hand is to identify which one(s) of the scores or hundreds of compounds are responsible for the observed &quot;in vitro&quot; activity, the path to that end is fairly straightforward:
# fractionate the crude extract, e.g. by solvent partitioning or chromatography.
# test the fractions thereby generated with &quot;in vitro&quot; assays.
# repeat steps 1) and 2) until pure, active compounds are obtained.
# determine structure(s) of active compound(s), typically by using spectroscopic methods.
&quot;In vitro&quot; activity does not necessarily translate to biological activity in humans or other living systems.

=== Herbal ===
In the past, in some countries in Asia and Africa, up to 80% of the population may rely on traditional medicine (including herbal medicine) for primary health care. Native American cultures have also relied on traditional medicine such as ceremonial smoking of tobacco, potlatch ceremonies, and herbalism, to name a few, prior to European colonization. Knowledge of traditional medicinal practices is disappearing in indigenous communities, particularly in the Amazon.

With worldwide research into pharmacology as well as medicine, traditional medicines or ancient herbal medicines are often translated into modern remedies, such as the anti-malarial group of drugs called artemisinin isolated from &quot;Artemisia annua&quot; herb, a herb that was known in Chinese medicine to treat fever. However, it was found that its plant extracts had antimalarial activity, leading to the Nobel Prize winning discovery of artemisinin.

== Microscopical evaluation ==
Microscopic evaluation is essential for the initial identification of herbs, identifying small fragments of crude or powdered herbs, identifying adulterants (such as insects, animal feces, mold, fungi, etc.), and recognizing the plant by its characteristic tissue features. Techniques such as microscopic linear measurements, determination of leaf constants, and quantitative microscopy are also utilized in this evaluation. The determination of leaf constants includes stomatal number, stomatal index, vein islet number, vein termination number, and palisade ratio.

The stomatal index is the percentage formed by the number of stomata divided by the total number of epidermal cells, with each stoma being counted as one cell.

formula_1

where:

S.I. is the stomatal index

S is the number of stomata per unit area

E is the number of epidermal cells in the same unit area.

<doc id="592952" wikidata="Q1211413" url="?curid=592952" title="Ho-Oh">
<text>Ho-Oh is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise who appears on the cover of &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot;, alongside the Pokémon Lugia, who appears on the cover of &quot;Pokémon Silver&quot;. It first appeared in a brief appearance in the first episode of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; TV series, seen by protagonist Ash Ketchum and unable to be identified.

Despite being grouped in the second generation of Pokémon species three years after the first generation, it is among the first Pokémon seen in the anime. It later made its video game debut in &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;. Since its debut, it has appeared in multiple games including &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, as well as various merchandise.

Classified as Fire and Flying-type Pokémon, Ho-Oh is a large bird with the features of different bird species with red-and-white feathers. It is tied to the mythology of the Johto region, believed to have resurrected the Pokémon Raikou, Entei, and Suicune after they died in the Brass Tower, renamed the Burnt Tower. It is one of the two legendary birds of Johto, alongside Lugia. Both can be obtained in both versions, with Ho-Oh available earlier in &quot;Gold&quot; than &quot;Silver&quot;. It also appears on the cover of &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; along with Lugia.

==Concept and development==
Ho-Oh is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Ho-Oh was first revealed in the August 1996 issue of &quot;CoroCoro Comics&quot; alongside &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;. When developing the games, around 300 individual Pokémon designs were drafted by various members of the development team, with each deciding their names and features, revising the drafts as needed. During this process, the team actively tried to avoid vague design concepts, as they felt this had caused difficulty in creating completed Pokémon during &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; development. As the team selected which Pokémon would be included, they were drawn and finalized by lead artist Ken Sugimori. To maintain balance, many of the newer species did not appear in the early stages of the game. Additionally, many of the Pokémon were designed with merchandise in mind, taking into account the related &quot;Pokémon&quot; toy line and anime series. As a result, designs often had to be kept simplistic, something that caused strain for Sugimori and affected his approach to the next &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise titles, &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. It was also revealed at E3 2000 as part of the lead-up to the North American release of &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;.

Ho-Oh is classified as both a Fire and Flying-type Pokémon, as well as being a Legendary Pokémon, a type of Pokémon that typically only appears once in a game. In the demo of &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; displayed at Spaceworld &#x27;97, Ho-Oh was exclusively Flying type. It has the ability to resurrect other beings. Its name comes from the on&#x27;yomi reading of fenghuang, the Chinese word for phoenix.

In the remakes &quot;HeartGold&quot; and &quot;SoulSilver&quot;, both Ho-Oh and Lugia get an exclusive battle theme. When composing Ho-Oh&#x27;s, composer Go Ichinose found it the most difficult to compose; he imagined Ho-Oh as a peaceful Pokémon, and made the song sound peaceful in turn. He worried that it would be too peaceful and thus take players out of the battle, and his compositions were declined multiple times due to not capturing Ho-Oh&#x27;s &quot;glory and strength.&quot; He ultimately had to make it less peaceful in the final version.

==Design==
Ho-Oh has features of different types of birds, including the head of a pheasant, the body of a duck, the legs of a crane, and the beak of a parrot. Its plumage is primarily red and white, with gold tail feathers and crest.

==Appearances==
In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video games, Ho-Oh first appeared in &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, appearing on the cover of &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; alongside Lugia on the cover on &quot;Pokémon Silver&quot;. These games are set in Johto, where both creatures are legendary figures in this region. Ho-Oh is said to have been responsible for reviving the Pokémon Raikou, Entei, and Suicune after they died in the Bronze Tower fire, which was later renamed the Burnt Tower, which took place in Ecruteak City. Ho-Oh then chose to reside at the Tin Tower in the same city, which cannot be accessed by the player until they receive the Rainbow Wing. This item is available sooner in &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot;, meaning that Ho-Oh is obtained later in &quot;Pokémon Silver&quot;. Ho-Oh also appears in most other &quot;Pokémon&quot; mainline sequels; while many require trading or transferring between games, some allow players to obtain it in-game. In &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot;, &quot;LeafGreen&quot;, and &quot;Emerald&quot;, the player can access an area called Navel Rock, where they can encounter Ho-Oh and Lugia. This was limited in the United States to only special events where Nintendo distributed a &quot;MysticTicket&quot; item to players using the Mystery Gift functionality of these games. It is initially unavailable in &quot;Pokémon Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot;, only made available through the &quot;Indigo Disk&quot; downloadable content.

It appears in multiple &quot;Pokémon&quot; spin-offs, including &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; and as a playable character in the &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon&quot; series. It can also be found in &quot;Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs&quot;. It also appears in the photography game &quot;New Pokémon Snap&quot;. Ho-Oh appears in &quot;Pokémon Unite&quot; as a playable character.

It also appears in &quot;Pokémon Go&quot;. There was an issue with players who nicknamed their Ho-Oh to change the name back to Ho-Oh due to word filtering.

Outside of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, Ho-Oh appears in multiple &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; titles; it appears as a collectible Trophy in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, &quot;Brawl&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot;. It also appears as a summonable character who can aide the summoner in &quot;Melee&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot;, and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;.

In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; TV series, Ho-Oh is one of the first Pokémon to appear, appearing at the end of the first episode after the conflict resolves. Protagonist Ash Ketchum attempts to identify it, but finds that it has not been documented. It is the first Pokémon from &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; to be publicly revealed. Its design is entirely gold, with a green aura around it. Ho-Oh is seen by Ash in a later episode, as well as the character May. Ash reencounters Ho-Oh in &quot;Pokémon Journeys: The Series&quot; while riding Lugia. Ho-Oh also appears in the film &quot;Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!&quot; A Ho-Oh-themed escape room called &quot;ホウオウの試練からの脱出&quot; (Escape from Ho-Oh&#x27;s Trial) was opened in eight different locations across Japan to commemorate this film&#x27;s release.

==Reception==
Ho-Oh has received generally positive reception. &quot;Futabanet&quot; writer Honey stated that Ho-Oh was a particularly popular Pokémon with Japanese kids during the time between &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;. It was also the subject of urban legends regarding obtaining Celebi, with different methods to obtain it involving Ho-Oh and Lugia. Writer Caleb Compton felt that Ho-Oh was a strong example of how &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; designed Pokémon to have more colorful Pokémon in general, including ones that incorporate &quot;vibrant complementary colors.&quot; He also discussed how Ho-Oh demonstrated how Legendary Pokémon in &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; became more than just powerful Pokémon, specifically in establishing the legend of Ho-Oh resurrecting the Legendary Beasts. He felt Ho-Oh&#x27;s visuals also better emphasize its Legendary status than Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres, who he felt were &quot;relatively ordinary.&quot; In an article in their &quot;Pokémon of the Day&quot; series, &quot;IGN&quot; staff identified it as the best Fire and Flying type in the series despite preferring Charizard personally. &quot;Dot Esports&quot; writer Adam Snavely considered Ho-Oh among the best Fire-type Pokémon, calling it a classic Legendary Pokémon and better than Moltres, another fire bird, in nearly every way.

Ho-Oh&#x27;s original appearance in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime is considered an iconic moment, with &quot;IGN&quot; staff identifying it as an &quot;amazing shared moment&quot; among Pokémon fans. &quot;IGN&quot; writer Audrey Drake also consider this moment a significant one, calling it &quot;magical&quot; and saying that she wanted to catch one of them back when she first saw it. She stated that she preferred it to Lugia, ranking it as one of the best Pokémon. In &quot;Pokémon Horizons: The Series&quot;, the reveal of the yet-introduced Legendary Pokémon Terapagos early on was contrasted with Ho-Oh&#x27;s early appearance by &quot;IGN&quot; writer Adam Bankhurst. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; writer Rodrigo Sandoval Lahut felt that Ho-Oh appeared to Ash because of his potential, citing a Pokedex entry that stated that Ho-Oh could only be seen by people with a pure heart. Specifically, Lahut believed that Ash putting his life on the line for Pikachu was enough for Ho-Oh to deem him worthy. He also believed that Ho-Oh making brief, sporadic appearances throughout the series was a sign that it was watching his progress. Honey stated that he found this moment an exciting thing to see as a child. &quot;Game Informer&quot; writer John Carson felt that Ho-Oh was a special Pokémon at the time, as showing a Pokémon that went beyond the initial 151 gave the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series a sense of mystery to him. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; writer Lucas Sullivan identified Moltres as being based on the Slavic firebird, he felt that Ho-Oh was based on the Chinese variant on the myth, the Fenghuang, which &quot;typically only shows up in places of great peace and prosperity.&quot;

<text>An FTP server is computer software consisting of one or more programs that can execute commands given by remote client(s) such as receiving, sending, deleting files, creating or removing directories, etc. The software may run as a software component of a program, as a standalone program or even as one or more processes (in the background).

An FTP server plays the role of a server in a client–server model using the FTP and/or the FTPS and/or the SFTP network protocol(s).

An FTP server can also be intended as a computer that runs an FTP server program to host collections of files. Big FTP sites can be run by many computers in order to be able to serve the desired maximum number of clients connected to servers.

A client program connects to an FTP server, then, unless anonymous access is enabled, it has to authenticate itself by sending username and password; after that it can retrieve and/or send files to the server along with other operations (depending on user&#x27;s privileges).

<text>The Welsh Football League Division One, known as the Nathanielcars.co.uk Welsh League First Division for sponsorship reasons, was a football league in South Wales. It formed the top division of the Welsh Football League and the second level of the Welsh football league system until the 2019–20 season when it was replaced by the Cymru South. From the 2019–20 season it operated at the third level of the Welsh football league system. 

If the team which finished top of the Division had good enough ground facilities, it was promoted to the Welsh Premier League and was replaced by one of the two teams finishing bottom of the Premiership. If the Division champions&#x27; ground did not meet Premiership standards, then the team which finished second may have been promoted. The team which finished in bottom position was relegated to the Welsh Football League Division Two.

From its inception in 1904 it had always been the top flight of the Welsh League, or the Rhymney Valley League and Glamorgan League as it was known until 1912. This division changed its name on numerous occasions, which includes Premier Division and National Division.

In 1992 it became level two of the Welsh Football Pyramid following the creation of the Welsh Premier League.

In 2019 it became level three of the Welsh Football Pyramid following the creation of the Cymru South. It folded in 2020 after the Football Association of Wales took over the running of tier 3 leagues and the responsibility for tier 4 passed to regional football associations.

<doc id="592964" wikidata="Q19109" url="?curid=592964" title="Montenegrins">
<text>Montenegrins (, ) are a South Slavic ethnic group that share a common ancestry, culture, history, and language, identified with the country of Montenegro.

Montenegrins are mostly Orthodox Christians, but the population also includes Catholics, Muslims and irreligious people. The Montenegrin language is the official language of Montenegro.

Historically, the Montenegrin nation comprised many tribes. Most tribes formed in the 15th and 16th centuries, about the time when the Ottoman Empire established its control of the medieval state of Zeta. Today the tribes are mainly studied within the frameworks of social anthropology and family history, as they have not been used in official structures since the time (1852-1910) of the Principality of Montenegro, although some tribal regions overlap with contemporary municipal areas. The kinship groups give a sense of shared identity and descent.

Outside of Montenegro and Europe, Montenegrins form diaspora groups in (for example) the United States, Canada, Australia and Argentina. It is estimated that around 600,000 Montenegrin-descended people reside outside of Montenegro. In 2023 a total of 152,649 Montenegrins both held Montenegrin citizenship and resided outside of Montenegro.

==Genetics==
According to one triple analysis – autosomal, mitochondrial and paternal — of available data from large-scale studies on South Slavs and their proximal populations, the whole genome SNP data situates Montenegrins with Serbs in between two Balkan clusters. According to a 2020 autosomal marker analysis, Montenegrins are situated in between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians.

Y-DNA genetic study done in 2010 on 404 male individuals from Montenegro gave the following results: haplogroup I2a (29.7%), E-V13 (26.9%), R1b (9.4%), R1a (7.6%), I1 (6.1%), J2a1 (4.7%), J2b (4.4%), G2a (2.4%), Q (1.9%), I2b (1.7%), N (1.4%), H (1.4%), L (1.2%), and J1 (0.49%). A 2022 study on 267 samples from northeastern Montenegro found that the &quot;most common haplogroups are I2 and R1b, both identified in 23.97% of samples, followed by E (22.47%), J2 (11.61%), I1 (6.74%), G2 (3.75%), R1a (3.37%), I1 (1.12%), G (1.12%), N (0.75%), C (0.37%), T1 (0.37%) and Q1 (0.37%)&quot;.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

Slavs settled in the Balkans during the sixth and seventh centuries. According to , there existed three Serb polities on the territory of modern Montenegro: Duklja, roughly corresponding to the southern half; Travunia, the west; and the Principality of Serbia, the north. Duklja emerged as an independent state during the 11th century, initially held by the Vojislavljević dynasty, later to be conquered and incorporated into the state of the Nemanjić dynasty. &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; does not mention which Slavic people lived in Duklja, but the state was considered to be one of the first Serb states, alongside Raška formed chiefly under the Vlastimirović and Vojislavljević dynasties respectively. Who exactly were the Slavic inhabitants of Duklja differs among authors, as other historians maintain that it is not possible to equate the people of Duklja with either Serbs or Croats, considering most historical Byzantian documents from that time.

In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro (Zeta) came under the rule of the Balšić noble family, then the Crnojević noble family, and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as &quot;Crna Gora&quot; (Venetian: &quot;&quot;). The Crnojevići were driven out from Zeta by the Ottomans and forced to retreat above the Bay of Kotor where they built a monastery and a royal court in Cetinje, the future royal capital of Montenegro, before eventually fleeing to Venice.

===Yugoslav era===

Annexation of the Kingdom of Montenegro on 13 November 1918 gained international recognition only at the Conference of Ambassadors in Paris, held on 13 July 1922.

Although Montenegrins comprised one of the smallest ethnic groups in the state (2.5% in 1971), they were the most overrepresented ethnic group in the Yugoslav bureaucracy, military, and communist party organs. In the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, 19% of general officers and 30% of colonels were ethnic Montenegrins. Among party elites, Montenegrins made up 16% to 21% of senior officials throughout the existence of communist Yugoslavia, and comprised a similar portion of the state&#x27;s diplomatic corps. Montenegrins were over-represented among Yugoslavia&#x27;s elite, largely due to the pre-war strength of the Communist Party of Montenegro, the high proportion of Montenegrins among Partisan commanders and Central Committee members during the war, and a historically militaristic culture. During this period, ethnic Montenegrins also held about 15% of government jobs in Yugoslavia.

==Language==
As per the census held from 3 to 28 December 2023, 34.52% of Montenegrin citizens say Montenegrin is their mother tongue.

==Religion==

Most Ethnic Montenegrins are Eastern Orthodox, with the majority of them adhering to the Serbian Orthodox Church, while a minority of them adhere to the Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which is canonically unrecognised by the Eastern Orthodox Church.

<text>The [[Welsh Football League]] Division Two, (last known as the &quot;Nathanielcars.co.uk Welsh League Division Two&quot;, for sponsorship reasons) was a football league and forms the fourth level of the Welsh football league system in South Wales.

If the team which finishes top of the division has good enough ground facilities, traditionally it was promoted to the Welsh Football League Division One and is replaced by the team finishing bottom of Division One. The team finishing in bottom position is relegated to the Welsh Football League Division Three. For the 2019–20 season promotion was to the newly formed Ardal Leagues at Tier 3 and relegation was to one of the regional leagues.

From its inception in 1904 it always sat below the top flight of the Welsh League, or the Rhymney Valley League and Glamorgan League as it was known until 1912. This division has changed its title on numerous occasions to follow suit of the other leagues within the competition; for seven years in the 1980s it was known as the Premier Division as the top flight adopted the National Division name, while Division Two was split into two sections - A &amp; B and West &amp; East - for many years before 1965.

In 1992 it became level three of the Welsh Football Pyramid following the creation of the Welsh Premier League.

After the creation of the Cymru South, for the 2019–20 season, the league was rebranded and Welsh Football League Division Two incorporated the former Division Three teams.

Following these changes, a Tier 3, Division Two was created. operated under the &quot;Division Two&quot; title.

From 1983-84 season, the Premier Division changed its name to the &quot;National Division&quot; and the First Division adopted the &quot;Premier Division&quot; With these changes the third tier Division Two was renamed &#x27;Division One&#x27;

With the creation of the League of Wales for the 1992–93 season, the Welsh Football League moved to levels two, three and four of the Welsh football pyramid, and adopted the titles of Division One, Division Two and Division Three respectively.

After the creation of the Cymru South, for the 2019–20 season, the league was rebranded as the Welsh Football League Division Two and Division Three was defunct.

<doc id="593019" wikidata="Q588784" url="?curid=593019" title="Light-weight Linux distribution">
<text>A light-weight Linux distribution is a Linux distribution that uses lower memory and processor-speed requirements than a more &quot;feature-rich&quot; Linux distribution. The lower demands on hardware ideally result in a more responsive machine, and allow devices with fewer system resources (e.g. older or embedded hardware) to be used productively. The lower memory and processor-speed requirements are achieved by avoiding software bloat, i.e. by leaving out features that are perceived to have little or no practical use or advantage, or for which there is no or low demand.

The perceived weight of a Linux distribution is strongly influenced by the desktop environment included with that distribution. Accordingly, many Linux distributions offer a choice of editions. For example, Canonical hosts several variants (&quot;flavors&quot;) of the Ubuntu distribution that include desktop environments other than the default GNOME or the deprecated Unity. These variants include the Xubuntu and Lubuntu distributions for the comparatively light-weight Xfce and LXDE / LXQt desktop environments.

The demands that a desktop environment places on a system may be seen in a comparison of the minimum system requirements of Ubuntu 10.10 and Lubuntu 10.10 desktop editions, where the only significant difference between the two was their desktop environment. Ubuntu 10.10 included the Unity desktop, which had minimum system requirements of a 2 GHz processor with 2 GB of RAM, while Lubuntu 10.10 included LXDE, which required at least a Pentium II with 128 MB of RAM.

==Overview of some distributions==

*ArchBang – inspired by CrunchBang Linux but based on the Arch Linux distribution instead of Debian.
* DebianDog - Debian Live CD shaped after Puppy Linux. It is packaged with JWM and IceWM, or Openbox and Xfce. Debian structure and behaviour are untouched.
*LinuxConsole - a lightweight system for old computers made to be easy for youth and casual users.
* MiniOS - a debian based live system with various Desktop Environments.
*Parabola GNU/Linux-libre - an Arch-based lightweight system endorsed by the Free Software Foundation.
*postmarketOS – a derivative of Alpine Linux designed primarily for smartphones
* Arch-based distros: Mabox, Archcraft, and Archman.

<doc id="593023" wikidata="Q283680" url="?curid=593023" title="Carchemish">
<text>Carchemish ( or ), also spelled Karkemish (), was an important ancient capital in the northern part of the region of Syria. At times during its history the city was independent, but it was also part of the Mitanni, Hittite and Neo-Assyrian Empires. Today it is on the frontier between Turkey and Syria.

It was the location of an important battle, about 605 BC, between the Babylonians and Egyptians, mentioned in the Bible (Jer. 46:2, 2 Chron. 35:20). Modern neighbouring cities are Karkamış in Turkey and Jarabulus in Syria (also Djerablus, Jerablus, Jarablos, Jarâblos).

==Geography of the site==
Carchemish is now an extensive set of ruins (90 hectares, of which 55 lie in Turkey and 35 in Syria), located on the West bank of Euphrates River, about southeast of Gaziantep, Turkey, and northeast of Aleppo, Syria. The site is crossed by the Baghdad Railway that now forms the Turco-Syrian border. The site includes an acropolis along the river, an Inner Town encircled by earthen ramparts and an Outer Town (most of which lies in Syrian territory). A Turkish military base has been established at the site and access but only the acropolis is presently of restricted access.

==History of research==
Carchemish has always been well known to scholars because of several references to it in the Bible (Jer. 46:2; 2 Chr. 35:20; Isa. 10:9) and in Egyptian and Assyrian texts. In 1874, James H. Skene, British Consul at Aleppo proposed its identification. This was confirmed in 1876 by George Smith. Carchemish had been previously identified, incorrectly, with the Classical city of Circesium, at the confluence of the Khabur River and the Euphrates.

Between 1878 and 1881 soundings were conducted by Consul Patrick Henderson on behalf of the British Museum. Between 1911 and 1914 full excavations were conducted under the direction of D. G. Hogarth. In 1911 on the field there were D. G. Hogarth himself, R. C. Thompson, and T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;), from 1912 to 1914 C. L. Woolley and T. E. Lawrence, while a last campaign took place in 1920 with C. L. Woolley and Philip Langstaffe Ord Guy. Excavations were interrupted in 1914 by World War I and then ended in 1920 with the Turkish War of Independence. These expeditions uncovered substantial remains of the Assyrian and Neo-Hittite periods, including defensive structures, temples, palaces, and numerous basalt statues and reliefs with Luwian hieroglyphic inscriptions. Between 1956 and 1998, the whole site had been mined by the Turkish Land Forces.

With the completion in February 2011 of mine clearing operations on the Turkish portion of the site, archaeological work was resumed in September 2011. Excavations in the Inner and Outer Towns were carried out by a joint Turco-Italian team from the Universities of Bologna, Gaziantep, and University of Istanbul under the direction of Prof. Dr. Nicolò Marchetti.
The second season, from August to November 2012, brought several new art findings and archaeological discoveries, the most remarkable of which is Katuwa&#x27;s Palace (c. 900 BC) to the east of the Processional Entry.

The third season, from May to October 2013, extended the exposure of Katuwa&#x27;s palace, retrieving a cuneiform tablet with an exorcism in the name of the god Marduk, as well as the ruins of Lawrence&#x27;s excavation house in the Inner Town, from which literally hundreds of fragments of sculptures and hieroglyphic inscriptions have been retrieved.

The fourth season started in May 2014 and continued through October 2014: in Katuwa&#x27;s palace several orthostats exquisitely carved with a procession of gazelle-bearers have been found, some of them in situ, next to a courtyard paved with squared slabs. In the Neo Assyrian period that courtyard was covered by a mosaic floor made of river pebbles forming squares alternating in black and white color. Lawrence&#x27;s excavation house was completely excavated.

During the fifth season, April to October 2015, more significant discoveries have been made in the palace area, both for Late Hittite sculptures, and Neo Assyrian refurbishments, with tens of items—including two fragments of clay prismatical cylinders inscribed with a unique cuneiform text by Sargon, intended for display, telling how he captured and reorganized the city of Karkemish—retrieved in a 14-m-deep well, sealed in 605 BC at the time of the Late Babylonian takeover.

The sixth season, May to July 2016, saw a number of excavation areas opened also near the border, due to the added security represented by the construction of the wall (see below). Thus, in 2016 a complete stratigraphic record was obtained also for peripheral areas, greatly adding to our understanding of urban development between LB II and the Achaemenid period.

In the seventh season, from 7 May to 18 July 2017, the major breakthroughs were the beginning of the excavations on the north-western end of the acropolis and the discovery in the eastern Lower Palace area of a monumental building dating from the LB II. Among the finds, in addition to new sculpted complete artworks from the Iron Age, fragments of Imperial Hittite clay cuneiform tablets and c. 250 inscribed bullae should be mentioned.

The eighth season lasted from 4 May to 20 July 2019 and revealed a massive palace on the top of the acropolis dating from Late Bronze II, exposed more architecture and finds from the LB II administrative building in area C East (which seems to be the Hittite E2.KIŠIB) and more of the Iron I storage facility in area S.

Archaeological investigations on the Syrian side have been conducted as part of the Land of Carchemish project: investigations of the Outer Town of Carchemish were undertaken in conjunction with the DGAM in Damascus and with the funding and sponsorship of the Council for British Research in the Levant and of the British Academy, under the direction of the late Professors T. J. Wilkinson and E. Peltenburg.

==Current status==
Conservation and presentation works have now been completed and the archaeological park at the site is finally open since 13 July 2019, thanks to the support also of Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality and Gaziantep Province: the site may be visited between 9 am and one hour before sunset through guided tours every two hours for security reasons. Financial support has been received by the three Universities mentioned above, by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Sanko Holding, with the technical support also of Şahinbey Municipality and Inta A.Ş.

The Outer Town area lying in Syria has been designated, already before the Syrian Civil War, an endangered cultural heritage site and labelled &quot;at risk&quot; by the Global Heritage Fund, due to agricultural expansion and, especially, urban encroachment. The field assessment of the Syrian part of the Outer Town documented that parts of the modern border town of Jerablus encroached upon the Outer Town. In July 2019, a scientific visit to the outer town in Syria by the Turco-Italian Archaeological Expedition at Karkemish, entailed the protection of the area from further encroachment by the sprawling town of Jerablus and by the facilities for trucks which were being built to the South of the border: the City Council of Jerablus declared all the area enclosed by the Iron Age city walls a &quot;first degree protected site&quot;, meaning the complete ban of any activity on it.

In February 2016, a prefabricated security wall (thus with no foundations that could have damaged the ancient site) was completed by the Turkish Army to the south of the railway, stretching between the Euphrates bridge and the train station of Karkamış.

==History==

The site has been occupied since the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods (pot burials).

===Early Bronze===
In the late Early Bronze, cist tombs dating to around 2400 BC have been found. The city is mentioned in documents found in the Ebla archives of the 3rd millennium BC.

===Middle Bronze===
==== Middle Bronze IIA ====
According to documents from the archives of Mari and Alalakh, dated from c. 1800 BC, Carchemish was then ruled by a king named Aplahanda, followed by his son, Yatar-Ami, (a contemporary of Mari ruler Zimri-Lim) and was an important center of timber trade. It had treaty relationships with Ugarit and Mitanni (Hanilgalbat). Another ruler of Carchemish in that period was Iahdun-Lim. In ancient times, the city commanded the main ford in the region across the Euphrates, a situation which must have contributed greatly to its historical and strategic importance. After about 1745 BC, and the reign of Yahdul-Lim, not much is further known about Carchemish.

==== Hittite influence ====
Little is known until the 1620s, when the city is mentioned in connection with the siege of Urshu (Ursha) by the Hittite king Hattusili I. At that time, Carchemish was allied with the kingdom of Yamhad, centered in Aleppo, in supporting Urshu, but their efforts were unsuccessful, and the city fell, along with many other Syrian cities. Hattusili and his successor Mursili I campaigned several years against Yamhad. Also Hantili I conducted a campaign to Carchemish to face the Hurrians.

===Late Bronze===
==== Egyptian influence ====
Pharaoh Thutmose I of the Eighteenth Dynasty erected a stele near Carchemish to celebrate his conquest of Syria and other lands beyond the Euphrates.

==== Mitanni influence ====
Under the Mitanni Empire, the city was a stronghold of Tushratta of Mitanni until its siege and conquest by Šuppiluliuma I (c. 1345 BC).

==== Hittite influence ====
Around the end of the reign of Pharaoh Tutankhamen, Carchemish was captured by king Šuppiluliuma I of the Hittites (c. 14th century BC), who made it into a kingdom ruled by his son Piyassili.

Piyassili (Šarri-Kušuḫ) was followed by his son Shakhurunuwa (:fr:Sahurunuwa), about whom relatively little is known. He participated in the Battle of Kadesh (1274 BC). He was followed by Ini-Teššub.

=== Iron Age ===
The city became one of the most important centres in the Hittite Empire, during the Late Bronze Age, and reached its apogee around the 13th century BC. While the Hittite empire fell to the Sea Peoples during the Bronze Age collapse, Carchemish survived the Sea Peoples&#x27; attacks to continue to be the capital of an important Neo-Hittite kingdom in the Iron Age, and a trading center.

Although Ramesses III states in an inscription dating to his 8th Year from his Medinet Habu mortuary temple that Carchemish was destroyed by the Sea Peoples, the city evidently survived the onslaught.

==== Kuzi-Teshub I ====
King Kuzi-Teshub (Kuzi-Tesup) is attested in power here and was the son of Talmi-Teshub who was a contemporary of the last Hittite king, Šuppiluliuma II. He and his successors ruled a &quot;mini-empire&quot; stretching from Southeast Asia Minor to Northern Syria and the West bend of the Euphrates under the title &quot;Great King&quot;. This suggests that Kuzi-Tesub saw himself as the true heir of the line of the great Šuppiluliuma I and that the central dynasty at Hattusa was now defunct. This powerful polity lasted from to 975 BC when it began losing control of its farther possessions and became gradually a more local city state centered around Carchemish.

After Kuzi-Teshub, some of the kings of Carchemish, such as Tuthaliya I, Sapaziti, and Ura-Tarhunza, continued to use the title ‘Great King’ in order to advance their power interests.

==== House of Suhi ====
Suhi I was the first known ruler of the dynasty of Carchemish that followed. He ruled in early 10th century BC, and was followed by Astuwalamanza.

Katuwa, son of Suhi II, is the best known ruler of this dynasty as known in the Hieroglyphic Luwian sources. He reigned around 880 BC.

==== Relations with Assyria ====
In the mid-13th century BC, after the fall of the Mitanni, Shalmaneser I visited Carchemish together with Prince Tukultī-Ninurta.

In the 9th century BC, King Sangara (870-848 BC), the last member of the dynasty, paid tribute to Kings Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III of Assyria.

Sangara already appeared in the Balawat Bronze Bands of Ashurnasirpal II as a tributary probably at some time before 868 BC. According to the archaeologist Shigeo Yamada, Karkamish may have been known during this period as &#x27;Sazabê&#x27;, “a fortified city of Sangara the Karkamishean”. Nevertheless, Sangara failed to leave any inscriptions at the city of Karkamish itself as far as is known. Still, in 2015 his name was identified in Hieroglyphic Luwian for the first time in a local inscription.

Following this period, Karkamish does not appear in Assyrian sources until the mid-8th century BC. The only exception was a brief mention by Samši-Adad V (824–811 BC). Nevertheless, only 20 km downstream the Euphrates river, at the city of Til-Barsip (modern Tell Ahmar), the Assyrians established an important provincial capital. They renamed their new city as &#x27;Kar-Shalmaneser&#x27;, yet the old name was also used.

==== Stele of Kubaba ====
In 2015, for the first time, the name of Sangara has been documented in a hieroglyphic Luwian inscription originally erected in Carchemish, itself. The six extant pieces of the basalt stele of the goddess Kubaba from Karkemish, currently housed in three different museums, have finally been all discovered and assembled together. This stele was made by king Kamani of Karkemish around 790 BC. The top part of this stele was drawn in 1876 by George Smith and transported in 1881 to the British Museum.

In 1876, this was the longest hieroglyphic Luwian inscription known until then. Based on it, Smith was the first to link the site with the Hittites as mentioned in the Bible, and also to identify it as Carchemish.

The House of Suhi are known for their extensive building program. They left a prominent set of monuments, with sculptures and inscriptions. Among the monuments they left, there are portal lions, inscriptions, relief orthostats and freestanding statues.

==== House of Astiruwa ====
The House of Astiruwa was the last known dynasty of rulers of Carchemish, and king Astiruwa (ca 848-790 BC) was the founder of this dynasty. Then came kings Yariri, Kamani, and Sastura.

King Yariri started to reign after 790 BC. He was a great scholar, and left extensive records of his time.

Carchemish was conquered by Sargon II in 717 BC in the reign of King Pisiri, the last ruler of the House of Astiruwa.

==== Battle of Carchemish ====

In the summer of 605 BC, the Battle of Carchemish was fought there by the Babylonian army of Nebuchadnezzar II and that of Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt and the remnants of the Assyrian army (Jer. 46:2). The aim of Necho&#x27;s campaign was to contain the Westward advance of the Babylonian Empire and cut off its trade route across the Euphrates. However, the Egyptians were defeated by the unexpected attack of the Babylonians and were eventually expelled from Syria.

After a brief Neo-Babylonian occupation, the Turco-Italian excavations found evidence for three phases of Achaemenid occupation, a significant reconstruction in Hellenistic times, a monumental phase from the Late Roman period, an Early Byzantine and three Abbasid phases before the final abandonment of the site until the early 1900s.

==Kings of Carchemish==


== Goddess Kubaba ==


The patron goddess of Carchemish was Kubaba, a deity of apparently Hurrian origins. She was represented as a dignified woman wearing a long robe, standing or seated, and holding a mirror. The main male deity of the town was Karhuha, akin to the Hittite stag-god Kurunta.

Kubaba was also the goddess of Alalakh, located in the coastal Amik Valley.

In 2015, a basalt stele of Kubaba, originally from Karkemish, was assembled back together from six separate broken pieces currently housed in three different museums around the world. This stele was originally made by king Kamani of Karkemish around 790 BC. The Luwian hieroglyphic inscription on this stele can now be read more fully, and it carries some important information about Karkemish history.

Kubaba appears to be one of the three main deities worshipped in Carchemish during the Middle Bronze Age. The other two were Nergal and Nubandag. The chief god was the Mesopotamian-influenced Nergal, who was the city-god of Carchemish. He was also called &quot;Il-Karkamis&quot;, “God of Karkemish”, as is evidenced on an Old Babylonian hematite cylinder seal in the British Museum collections (BM 89172).

The warrior god Nubandag has Hurrian roots. According to the Mari texts, he was worshipped at Carchemish in the Old Babylonian period along with Nergal.

Later, beginning in the mid-14th century BC, the city-god of Carchemish became the warrior god Karhuha, similar to Kurunta (god). He was seen as a Stag-god, and his cult was probably introduced to Carchemish under the Mitannian influence.

These deities clearly reflect the geographical position of Carchemish at the crossing of important trade routes; because of this, the city became a mixed cultural and religious centre.

==Material Culture==
Among the many artefacts recovered at Karkemish, typical of this territory are the Handmade Syrian Horses and Riders and the Syrian Pillar Figurines. These are clay figurines dating from mid-8th-7th centuries BCE that have been found in several hundreds in the town. These terracottas were manufactured during the Neo-Assyrian phase of Karkemish and it is currently believed they might have represented male and female characters performing distinguished public roles.
