<text>The Salzkammergut (, ; ) is a resort area in Austria, stretching from the city of Salzburg eastwards along the Alpine Foreland and the Northern Limestone Alps to the peaks of the Dachstein Mountains. The main river of the region is the Traun, a right tributary of the Danube.

The name translates to &quot;salt demesne&quot; (or &quot;salt domain&quot;), being a German word for territories held by princes of the Holy Roman Empire, in early modern Austria specifically territories of the Habsburg monarchy. The salt mines of Salzkammergut were administered by the Imperial in Gmunden from 1745 to 1850.

Parts of the region were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

==Geography==
The lands on the shore of the Traun River comprise numerous glacial lakes and raised bogs, the Salzkammergut Mountains and the adjacent Dachstein Mountains, the Totes Gebirge and the Upper Austrian Prealps with prominent Mt. Traunstein in the east. The towering mountain slopes are characterized by bright limestone (karst) and flysch rocks.

Salzkammergut is not an official administrative division of Austria and as such has no clear borders. The historical term referred not to a region but to specific possessions (salt mines) of the Habsburg monarchy within the region. Since 2002, however, there has been a well-defined , marketed by , a company located in Bad Ischl. As defined by this company, Salzkammergut as a tourist region includes 
58 municipalities in three Austrian states, the majority within Upper Austria (Gmunden and Vöcklabruck districts), besides smaller portions of Styria and
Salzburg.
 divides the Salzkammergut region into ten sub-regions, as follows:
* : Bad Aussee, Styria
* : Wolfgangsee, Salzburg
* : Fuschlsee, Salzburg
* : Hallstätter See, Bad Goisern, Hallstatt, Obertraun and Gosau, Upper Austria
* : Traunsee, Upper Austria
* : Attersee, Upper Austria
* : Mondsee (town), Mondsee, Irrsee, Upper Austria
* : Bad Ischl, Upper Austria
* : Attergau, Upper Austria
* : Almtal, Upper Austria

==History==
Archaeological findings in the area date back to the Neolithic era, especially the stilt houses of the Mondsee group culture, who settled the region from about 3800 BC onwards. The Germanic name &quot;hall&quot; of several settlements refers to the region&#x27;s numerous salt mines, which had been in use at least since the days of the Celtic Hallstatt culture, centered at the mining town of Hallstatt. These operations were continued by the Romans, after the area had been incorporated into the Noricum province in 15 BC. A Roman settlement and salt evaporation pond at Hallstatt is documented about 100, affected by several Germanic invasions after the Marcomannic Wars, until the province was finally evacuated at the behest of the Italian king Odoacer in 488.

From about 530, Bavarii tribes settled the region from the west, they encountered Alpine Slavs who had moved northwards through the Enns Valley and across the Dachstein Mountains. From 900 salt trade is again documented along the Traun River, when the area was part of the &quot;Traungau&quot; region of the German stem duchy of Bavaria, held by the comital dynasty of the Otakars, who from 1056 also ruled over the neighbouring March of Styria. While most of the Traungau fell to the Babenberg duchy of Austria upon the deposition of the Bavarian duke Henry the Lion in 1180, the southeastern Ausseerland remained with the newly-established Duchy of Styria, which nevertheless from 1192 was held in personal union by the Austrian Babenbergs.

In 1278 King Rudolph I of Germany, a scion of the Swabian House of Habsburg, finally seized both duchies from King Ottokar II of Bohemia, whom he defeated in the Battle on the Marchfeld. Rudolph&#x27;s son King Albert I of Germany defended his hegemony against the rival Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg to the west and in 1298 made the lands of Ischl a present to his wife Countess Elisabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol. 
Emperor Maximilian I added to the territory the estates of Mondsee Abbey in 1506.

The Habsburg officials resided at Wildenstein Castle near Ischl and the surrounding estates were designated a &quot;Kammergut&quot;, as first documented in a 1656 deed. In the 17th century, Ischl and Hallstatt were considered separate &quot;Kammergüter&quot;. The salt mines were immediate domains of the Habsburg King of the Romans and mining part of his princely &quot;regalia&quot;. The salt mines were administered by the financial aulic chamber at Vienna, represented by the salt chamber (&quot;Salzamt&quot;) in Gmunden, established in the 15th century. The &quot;Salzkammer&quot; in Gmunden was made &quot;Salzoberamt&quot; by a decree of empress Maria Theresia of 22 May 1745.

The term &quot;Salzkammergut&quot; dates to this period, during which the Gmunden &quot;Salzoberamt&quot; was the administrative seat of all salt mines in the region, with subordinate offices at Ischl, Ebensee am Traunsee, Stadl, Lambach, Wels, Zizlau, Enghagen, Mauthausen and Linz.
The &quot;Salzämter&quot; were dissolved in the 19th century. Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1850 transformed the Gmunden &quot;Salzoberamt&quot; into the &quot;k.k. Salinen- und Forstdirektion &quot;, the predecessor of the modern &quot;Salinen Austria AG&quot; (a joint-stock company since 1979, fully privatised in 1997).

==Economy==
During the time of Emperor Franz Joseph I, the Salzkammergut area was a hub of cultured life. The Emperor spent his summer holidays in Bad Ischl in the Kaiservilla, from which he governed his empire in the warmer months. This was also where he signed the declaration of war with Serbia that started World War I.

The salt mining industry is the namesake of the region, but is today a relatively minor contributor to the local economy. The forest industry is now more important.
Industrial sites include Ebensee, Gmunden, Laakirchen and Steyrermühl. The Salzkammergut also profits from its tradition of small businesses and trade companies, many of which originated due to the salt mining.

The unemployment rate was approximately 4.8% in 2005, compared to an overall figure of 7.3% for Austria.

A well-known narrow-gauge railway, the Salzkammergut-Lokalbahn formerly ran from Salzburg to Bad Ischl, but it closed in 1957. A standard gauge railroad continues to run through the region, as well as the Schafbergbahn rack railway in St. Wolfgang.

Recreational facilities include swimming and water sports at the many lakes, mountaineering, cycling and horse riding holidays, winter sports and cultural events. The region owes its reputation as a recreational area not only to its landscape and climate but also to its many spas. It remains a major tourist area despite its age.

Since 2002, the tourism region has marketed itself with the &quot;Salzkammergut Tourismus-Marketing GmbH&quot; (salzkammergut.at), a holding company of the 54 municipalities of the Salzkammergut that are entitled to use the name “Salzkammergut” as a brand according to the tourism regulations of the three provinces.

==UNESCO World Heritage Site==

UNESCO designated &quot;Hallstatt–Dachstein/Salzkammergut Cultural Landscape&quot; (&quot;Kulturlandschaft Hallstatt–Dachstein/Salzkammergut&quot;) a World Heritage Site in 1997, with the description
:&quot;Human activity in the magnificent natural landscape of the Salzkammergut began in prehistoric times, with the salt deposits being exploited as early as the 2nd millennium B.C. This resource formed the basis of the area&#x27;s prosperity up to the middle of the 20th century, a prosperity that is reflected in the fine architecture of the town of Hallstatt.&quot;
The area designated was defined on an area of 284 square kilometres, with a &quot;buffer zone&quot; of another 200 square kilometres.
The core zone includes the towns Hallstatt, Obertraun, Gosau and Bad Goisern.

The site sits at the core of interdisciplinary research and is helping to contribute to the understanding of socio-ecological systems and how these might help to address future challenges and the role that archaeologists can play in communicating and engaging with climate change and its impacts.

<doc id="605520" wikidata="Q592710" url="?curid=605520" title="Revisionist Zionism">
<text>Revisionist Zionism is a form of Zionism characterized by territorial maximalism. Revisionist Zionism promoted expansionism and the establishment of a Jewish majority on both sides of the Jordan River. Developed by Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky in the 1920s, this ideology advocated a &quot;revision&quot; of the &quot;practical Zionism&quot; of David Ben-Gurion and Chaim Weizmann which was focused on the settling of &quot;Eretz Yisrael&quot; (Land of Israel) by independent individuals. Differing from other types of Zionism, Revisionists insisted upon the Jewish right to sovereignty over the whole of &quot;Eretz Yisrael&quot;, including Mandatory Palestine and Transjordan. It was the main ideological opponent to the dominant socialist Labor Zionism. Revisionist Zionism has strongly influenced modern right-wing Israeli parties, principally Herut and its successor Likud. 

In 1935, after the Zionist Executive rejected Jabotinsky&#x27;s political program, Jabotinsky resigned from the World Zionist Organization and founded the &quot;New Zionist Organization&quot; (NZO), known in Hebrew as &quot;Tzakh&quot;. Its aim was to conduct independent political activity for free immigration and the establishment of a Jewish State. In its early years under Jabotinsky&#x27;s leadership, Revisionist Zionism was focused on gaining support from Britain for settlement. From the early 1930s, Jabotinsky believed that the United Kingdom could no longer be trusted to advance the Zionist cause, leading to a short-lived alliance with Italy.

Revisionist Zionism had its own paramilitary group, led by Jabotinsky until his death in 1940, called the Irgun. Both the Irgun and the Stern Gang, which emerged from it, were responsible for several attacks against the British to try to expel them from Palestine. After the White Paper of 1939 severely limited Jewish immigration to Palestine, just as the Nazis were gaining power, the Irgun and Lehi initiated campaigns against the British.

After the founding of Israel, control of the East Bank became increasingly less important in the ideology of Revisionist Zionism. Following the 1967 Six-Day War, when Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Revisionism&#x27;s territorial aspirations concentrated on these territories instead. By the 1970s, the legitimacy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was no longer questioned and in 1994, an overwhelming majority of Likud Knesset Members (MKs) voted for the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace.

==History==
=== Early history of Revisionist Zionism ===

Revisionist Zionism was based on a vision of &quot;political Zionism&quot;, which Jabotinsky regarded as following the legacy of Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern political Zionism. His main demand was the creation of Greater Israel on both sides of the Jordan River, and was against partitioning Palestine with the Arabs, such as suggested by the Peel Commission.

The 1921 British establishment of Transjordan (the modern-day state of Jordan) adversely affected this goal, and it was a great setback for the movement. Before Israel achieved statehood in 1948, Revisionist Zionism became known for its advocacy of more belligerent, assertive postures and actions against both British and Arab control of the region.

Criticism of the Churchill White Paper of 1922 sparked the establishment of the Revisionist Union. The central committee of the Revisionist Union defined its relationship with Great Britain as one of mutual loyalty but it was at odds with the mandatory administration. In the 1920s, Revisionist leadership wanted clearly to define the relationship of the Revisionist movement and the British Empire. It supported the proposal of British MP Josiah Wedgewood to make Palestine a Seventh Dominion of the British Empire. The proposal was ratified at the third Revisionist world conference which took place from December 26, 1928, to December 30, 1928. A year later, the proposal was approved by the executive committee as part of its working plan.

Jabotinsky established the Revisionist Party in 1925 with the intention of replacing the General Zionists. The 1929 riots by Arabs in Palestine led to the radicalization of the Zionist movement. This led to the dwindling of the General Zionist movement and the struggle for leadership in the 1931 elections to the 17th Zionist Congress between Revisionist Zionists and Labor Zionists. In the 1929 elections to the 16th Congress, the Revisionists won only 7% of the votes, but in the 1931 elections, they won 21% of the votes.

In 1931, Jabotinsky forced Chaim Weizmann to resign as president of the World Zionist Organization. Jabotinsky wanted to establish Revisionist Zionism as a separate movement that existed independent from the general Zionist movement. However, Revisionist delegates would not join Jabotinsky in announcing immediate secession from the Zionist movement. Supporters of Jabotinsky&#x27;s idea to secede were Abba Ahimeir, Uri Zvi Greenberg, and Zeev von Weisel. Jabotinsky created a political platform called &#x27;The Ultimate Objective&#x27; which demanded that Congress proclaim that the ultimate objective of Zionism was the establishment of a Jewish state that had a Jewish majority on both sides of the Jordan River. If the Congress accepted the platform, that would indicate that it supported Revisionist ideas and leadership. If it did not accept the platform, the Revisionists would secede. Ultimately, the platform was rejected after a cable was sent from Palestine by Eliyahu Golomb and Saadia Shoshani. The cable said that acceptance of the platform would lead to an Arab pogrom in Palestine. In response to the rejection of the platform, Jabotinsky tore up his membership card.

The debate over secession continued for two years until shortly before the elections for the 18th Congress in 1933. In March 1933, three months before the elections, Jabotinsky suspended the activities of all party institutions and deposed all central party functionaries. He also appointed himself sole leader of the Revisionist movement.

In 1935, the Revisionists seceded from the World Zionist Organization because of its refusal to declare the establishment of a Jewish state as its immediate aim. The Revisionists formed the New Zionist Organization and elected Jabotinsky as its president. The Revisionist movement was threatened with bankruptcy in 1936 when Jabotinsky moved his headquarters from Paris to London.

The Revisionists opposed the World Zionist Organization&#x27;s attempts to negotiate the Haavara trade agreement with Hitler. Jabotinsky attempted to get a motion passed to support an anti-Nazi boycott which was defeated 249 to 43. After this, Jabotinsky attempted to set up the Revisionist World Union as a boycott center, but this was also unsuccessful.

There were 10 Revisionist Zionist youth groups in Warsaw, Poland, one of which was Betar. Jabotinsky became head of Betar in 1929, but the actual organization was founded by Aron Propes in 1923. Menachem Begin joined Betar in 1929 in Poland and was head of the national unit, which was the largest branch of Betar in the world. Socialist Zionist youth movements in Poland warned of the rise of fascism in Poland in reference to the activities of Betar. Chaim Weizmann, the president of the World Zionist organization, referred to Betar&#x27;s connection with Italian fascism. In November 1934, Benito Mussolini organized a Betar squadron at Civitavecchia where 134 cadets were trained by the Blackshirts. Their training was ended in 1937 after Mussolini aligned himself with Hitler. One of the main messages of Betar was that Jews would only be able to survive if they fought back against violence or even struck first through violent means. Betar members defended Poland during the German invasion in 1939. In Sosnoweic, Betar members joined Catholic Polish youth in a civilian defense battalion. In Sanok, Betar members set up bomb shelters and dug trenches. In Bursztyn, Betar members joined a self-defense unit that was organized by Catholic Poles to defend against the possibility of a Ukrainian invasion into Polish territory. Jabotinsky and Menachem Begin both expressed solidarity with Poland following the German invasion. However, almost all of Betar&#x27;s national leadership in Warsaw fled Poland because of rumors that German troops were executing Polish and Jewish political activists. Begin also fled Poland and proposed to a Polish officer that a Jewish brigade should be established within the Polish army to defend against a German attack. Many of the activists who had fled Poland returned to organize underground activity to resist the German troops occupying the country.

In October 1937, Jabotinsky met with Marshall Edward Smygly-Rydz to arrange an alliance between Revisionist Zionist and the anti-semitic Polish regime. Jabotinsky used the Polish press to call for the evacuation of 1.5 million Jews from eastern Europe, mostly from Poland. In spring 1939, Poles set up a guerrilla training school for Revisionist Zionists at Zakopane in the Tatra Mountains. 25 members of the Irgun were brought to Poland from Palestine and were taught sabotage and insurrection by the Polish Army. The Polish Army also provided weapons for 10,000 men for a possible invasion of Palestine in April 1940. In August 1939, Menachem Begin told the Irgun that he wanted the invasion to take place in October 1939. He planned to lead the Betar who would land on the beach at Tel Aviv and the Irgun would occupy the Government House in Jerusalem, hold it for 24 hours, and declare a provisional government. After Jabotinsky died or was arrested, Revisionists in Europe and America would proclaim a government-in-exile. Jabotinsky changed the invasion plan after the 1939 White Paper. Britain restricted Zionist land purchases, limited immigration to 75,000 for the next five years, and suggested an Arab-dominated state be formed in the next 10 years.

After the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Jabotinsky focused on creating another Jewish Legion. The only place where he could recruit people to join this organization was the United States and he did not arrive there until March 1940. He also attempted to convince British politicians to help him recruit this army, but they did not agree to do so. The British believed that they had Jewish support in their war against Nazi Germany and they believed that the creation of another Jewish Legion would create tension in the Middle East.

=== History of Revisionist Zionism after Israel&#x27;s establishment ===
During the first two decades after the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948, the main revisionist party, Herut (founded in June 1948), remained in opposition. The party slowly began to revise its ideology in an effort to change this situation and to gain political power. While Begin maintained the Revisionist claim to Jewish sovereignty over all of Eretz Israel, by the late 1950s, control over the East Bank of the Jordan ceased to be integral to Revisionist ideology. Following Herut&#x27;s merger with the Liberal Party in 1965, references to the ideal of Jewish sovereignty over &quot;both banks of the Jordan&quot; appeared less and less frequently. By the 1970s, the legitimacy of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was no longer questioned. In 1994 the complete practical abandonment of the &quot;both banks&quot; principle was apparent when an overwhelming majority of Likud Knesset Members (MKs) voted in favour of the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace.

The Herut party in 1948 won 14 seats in the 1949 elections. The official Revisionist party did not win any seats in the 1949 elections and would merge with Herut in 1950. In 1965, Herut became Gahal after merging with the Liberal Party. Gahal joined the government for the first time in 1967 and Menachem Begin became minister without portfolio in Levi Eshkol&#x27;s government. In July 1970, Begin and his colleagues left the National Unity Government under Golda Meir as a protest against the Rogers Peace Plan.

Gahal would become Likud in 1973 after merging with three nationalist splinter groups. In 1977, Menachem Begin and Likud took power in Israel, with Begin becoming Israel&#x27;s prime minister.

Following Israel&#x27;s capture of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Six-Day War, Revisionism&#x27;s territorial aspirations concentrated on these territories. These areas were far more central to ancient Jewish history than the East Bank of the Jordan and most of the areas within Israel&#x27;s post-1949 borders. In 1968 Begin defined the &quot;eternal patrimony of our ancestors&quot; as &quot;Jerusalem, Hebron, Bethlehem, Judea, [and] Shechem [Nablus]&quot; in the West Bank. In 1973 Herut&#x27;s election platform called for the annexation of the West Bank and Gaza. When Menachem Begin became leader of the broad Likud coalition (1973) and soon afterwards Prime Minister (in office: 1977–1983), he considerably modified Herut&#x27;s expansive territorial aims. The party&#x27;s aspiration to unite all of mandatory Palestine under Jewish rule was scaled down. Instead, Begin spoke of the historic unity of Israel in the West Bank, even hinting that he would make territorial concessions in the Sinai as part of a complete peace settlement.

When Begin finally came to power in the 1977 election, his overriding concern as Prime Minister (1977–1983) was to maintain Israeli control over the West Bank and Gaza.

In 1983, following criticism of the Israeli war in Lebanon in 1982 and the Sabra and Shatila massacre carried out by Israel&#x27;s Lebanese Christian allies, Begin resigned as prime minister of Israel. Begin was replaced by Yitzhak Shamir who was also a member of Likud in 1983. Another member of Likud, Benjamin Netanyahu, came from a family of Revisionist Zionists. He was elected prime minister of Israel in 1996.

==Jabotinsky and Revisionist Zionism==

After World War I, Jabotinsky was elected to the first legislative assembly in the Yishuv, and in 1921 he was elected to the Executive Council of the Zionist Organization (known as the World Zionist Organization after 1960). He quit the latter group in 1923, thanks mainly to differences of opinion with its chairman, Chaim Weizmann. In 1925, Jabotinsky formed the Revisionist Zionist Alliance, in the World Zionist Congress to advocate his views, which included increased cooperation with Britain on transforming the entire Mandate for Palestine territory, including Palestine itself and Transjordan, on opposite sides of the Jordan River, into a sovereign Jewish state, loyal to the British Empire. To this end, Jabotinsky advocated for mass Jewish immigration from Europe and the creation of a second Jewish Legion to guard a nascent Jewish state at inception. Jabotinsky wished to convince Britain that a Jewish state would be in the best interest of the British Empire, perhaps even an autonomous extension of it in the Middle East.

When, in 1935, the Zionist Organization failed to accept Jabotinsky&#x27;s program, he and his followers seceded to form the &quot;New Zionist Organization&quot;. The NZO rejoined the ZO in 1946. The Zionist Organization was roughly composed of General Zionists, who were in the majority, followers of Jabotinsky, who came in a close second, and Labour Zionists, led by David Ben-Gurion, who comprised a minority yet had much influence where it mattered, in the &quot;Yishuv&quot;.

Despite its strong representation in the Zionist Organization, Revisionist Zionism had a small presence in the Yishuv, in contrast to Labour Zionism, which was dominant among kibbutzim and workers, and hence the settlement enterprise. General Zionism was dominant among the middle class, which later aligned itself with the Revisionists. In the Jewish Diaspora, Revisionism was most established in Poland, where its base of operations was organized in various political parties and Zionist Youth groups, such as Betar. By the late 1930s, Revisionist Zionism was divided into three distinct ideological streams: the &quot;Centrists&quot;, the Irgun, and the &quot;Messianists&quot;.

Jabotinsky later argued for establishing a base in the Yishuv and developed a vision to guide the Revisionist movement and the new Jewish society on economic and social policy centered around the ideal of the Jewish middle class in Europe. Jabotinsky believed that basing the movement on a philosophy contrasting with the socialist-oriented Labour Zionists would attract the support of the General Zionists.

In line with this thinking, the Revisionists transplanted into the Yishuv a youth movement, Betar. They also set up a paramilitary group, Irgun, a labour union, the National Labor Federation in Eretz-Israel, and health services. The latter were intended to counteract the increasing hegemony of Labour Zionism over community services via the Histadrut and address the Histadrut&#x27;s refusal to make its services available to Revisionist Party members.

==Irgun Tsvai Leumi==

The paramilitary organization of the Revisionist movement was called the National Military Organization, or the Irgun. The Irgun (short for , Hebrew for &quot;National Military Organization&quot; ) had its roots initially in the Betar youth movement in Poland, which Jabotinsky founded. By the 1940s, they had transplanted many of its members from Europe and the United States to Palestine.

The Revisionists split from the Haganah in 1931 because they opposed its domination by the Histadrut. They formed the &quot;Haganah-B&quot; which was commanded by a Revisionist Zionist, Abraham Tehomi. &quot;Haganah B&quot; was founded by Avraham Tehomi in 1931. Tehomi led &quot;Haganah-B&quot; until December 1936 when he agreed to give the leadership position to Jabotinsky. The group did not became completely Revisionist until April 1937 when Tehomi and about a quarter of the 3,000 men in &quot;Haganah-B&quot; returned to the Haganah due to their support for the Mizrachi, General Zionists, and Jewish State Party. &quot;Haganah B&quot; was transformed into the Irgun after Tehomi split from the group to join the Haganah. Jabotinsky initially adopted the Haganah&#x27;s doctrine of self-restraint because he wanted a legal legion that was formally affiliated with the military and he thought that an illegal counterinsurgency would make that impossible. However, once &quot;Haganah B&quot; became the Irgun, the organization became an independent underground organization.

The Irgun carried out a number of attacks against the British and Arabs. In September 1937, the Irgun killed 13 Arabs which was said to be in retaliation for the deaths of three Jews. The summer of 1938 was the high point of the Irgun&#x27;s campaign. On July 6, 1938, the Irgun set off a bomb in a milk can in the Arab market in Haifa which killed 21 and injured 52. On July 15, 1938, an electric mine in David Street in Jerusalem killed 10 and injured 30. On July 25, 1938, the Irgun set off another bomb in the Arab market in Haifa which killed 35 and wounded 70. On August 26, 1938, the Irgun set off a bomb in the market in Jaffa which killed 24 and injured 35.

In response to the White Paper in 1939, the Irgun bombed British facilities. The British responded by arresting Irgun commander David Raziel in May. In addition, on August 31, 1939, the rest of the Irgun high command was apprehended while discussing Jabotinsky&#x27;s plan to invade Palestine.

The Irgun was commanded by Jabotinsky until his death in 1940. Menachem Begin commanded the Irgun from 1943 until the organization was dissolved in June 1948. In 1939, the Irgun called off their campaign against the British mandatory authorities for the duration of World War Two as the British fought against the Axis powers with the other Allied powers.

Acting often in conflict (but at times, also in coordination) with rival clandestine militias such as the Haganah and the Lehi (or Stern Group), the Irgun&#x27;s efforts would feature prominently in the armed struggles against British and Arab forces alike in the 1930s and 1940s, and ultimately become decisive in the closing events of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

==Lehi==
A group of fighters with particularly militant views in the Irgun formed an underground movement called &quot;The Fighters for the Freedom of Israel&quot; or the Stern Gang. This group used terrorism and political assassinations to try to expel the British from Palestine. Following Israel&#x27;s declaration of independence in May 1948, both the Irgun and the Stern Gang were dissolved and many of the organization&#x27;s members joined the Israel Defense Forces.

The movement called Lehi, and nicknamed the &quot;Stern Gang&quot; by the British, was led by Avraham &quot;Yair&quot; Stern until his death. Stern did not join the Revisionist Zionist party in university but instead joined another group called Hulda. He formed Lehi in 1940 as an offshoot from Irgun, which was initially named &quot;Irgun Zvai Leumi be-Yisrael&quot; (National Military Organization in Israel or NMO). Following Stern&#x27;s death in 1942—shot by a British police officer—and the arrest of many of its members, the group went into eclipse until it was reformed as &quot;Lehi&quot; under a triumvirate of Israel Eldad, Natan Yellin-Mor, and Yitzhak Shamir. Shamir became the Prime Minister of Israel forty years later.

Stern viewed Zionism as a national liberation movement and supported armed struggle to achieve independence. He did not want to wait until Britain&#x27;s war against Nazi Germany was over to begin an armed revolt against the British occupation of Palestine.

While the Irgun stopped its activities against the British during World War II, at least until 1944, Lehi continued guerrilla warfare against the British authorities. It considered the British rule of Mandatory Palestine to be an illegal occupation, and concentrated its attacks mainly against British targets (unlike the other underground movements, which were also involved in fighting against Arab paramilitary groups).

Stern reached out to Nazi Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini since both of these regimes opposed the British. After World War Two, the triumvirate that replaced Stern reached out to the Soviet Union to try to find an ally against Britain.

== Ideology ==

=== Ideology of pre-state Revisionist Zionism ===

The Revisionist Zionist movement did not have a clearly defined ideology which was more of a feature of Zionists on the left. Initially, the stance of the movement was to reject the policies of the contemporary Zionist leadership under Chaim Weizmann. The lack of a coherent ideology was something the movement took pride in since it removed them from the brand of traditional party politics and did not emphasize identification with religion or social class. However, despite the lack of a clear ideology, one clear belief of the original Revisionist leadership was the need to create a Jewish majority in Palestine despite the protests of the indigenous Arab population in the land. Jabotinsky would not accept the partition of Palestine into two states. He wanted a Jewish state that expanded over all of the Land of Israel, including the Emirate of Transjordan which had been established on the eastern part of the mandate of Palestine by the British. The two central points of the Revisionist program were that Trans-Jordan belonged to the Zionists and that the British must reconstitute the Jewish Legion as a permanent part of the military force in Palestine. The British had dissolved the Jewish Legion and separated Trans-Jordan from the territory given to the Jewish state under the Balfour Declaration after World War I.

Ideologically, Revisionism advocated the creation of a Jewish state on both sides of the Jordan River, that is, a state which would include all of present-day Israel, as well as the West Bank, Gaza and either all or part of the modern state of Jordan. Nevertheless, the terms of the Mandate allowed the mandatory authority, Britain, to restrict Jewish settlement in parts of the mandate territory. In 1922, before the Mandate officially came into effect in 1923, Transjordan was excluded from the terms regarding Jewish settlement. In the Churchill White Paper of 1922, the British Government had made clear that the intent expressed by the Balfour Declaration was that a Jewish National Home should be created &#x27;in&#x27; Palestine, not that the whole of Palestine would become a Jewish National Home. All three Revisionist streams, including Centrists who advocated a British-style liberal democracy, and the two more militant streams, which would become Irgun and Lehi, supported Jewish settlement on both sides of the Jordan River; in most cases, they differed only on how this should be achieved. (Some supporters within Labor Zionism, such as Mapai&#x27;s Ben-Gurion, also accepted this interpretation for the Jewish homeland.) Jabotinsky wanted to gain the help of Britain in this endeavour, while Lehi and the Irgun, following Jabotinsky&#x27;s death, wanted to conquer both sides of the river independently of the British. The Irgun stream of Revisionism opposed power-sharing with Arabs. In 1937, Jabotinsky rejected the conclusion of the Peel Commission, which proposed a partition of Palestine between Jews and Arabs; it was however accepted by the Labor Zionists. On the topic of &quot;transfer&quot; (expulsion of the Arabs), Jabotinsky&#x27;s statements were ambiguous. In some writings he supported the notion, but only as an act of self-defense, in others he argued that Arabs should be included in the liberal democratic society that he was advocating, and in others still, he completely disregarded the potency of Arab resistance to Jewish settlement, and stated that settlement should continue, and the Arabs be ignored.

Jabotinsky believed Arab opposition to Zionism was inevitable and that any efforts at reconciliation with Arabs would be unsuccessful. He believed that voluntary consent from the Arabs to turn Palestine into a country with a Jewish majority was not possible. Since Jabotinsky anticipated that the Arabs would resist against Jewish settlement in Palestine, he believed that superior military force was the only way to make them accept a Jewish state. Because of this, Jabotinsky advocated for an &quot;iron wall&quot; to assist the Zionist movement, meaning that he wanted a military force independent of the Arab population that the Arabs would not be able to resist successfully. This military force would protect Jewish immigration to Palestine and would allow the goals of Zionism to be achieved. This was one of the more radical and militant perspectives among Zionist thinkers.

Jabotinsky believed that it was necessary for people to own private property in order to have liberty which was part of his anti-materialist, anti-communist world view. Despite this belief, he still promised that the bourgeois regime that he wanted to take power in the Jewish state would eliminate poverty. The economic crises of the Yishuv in 1926 and 1927 caused Revisionists to shift their support to urban development and private capital investment.

Five figures in particular contributed to the formation of Jabotinsky&#x27;s ideology: English historian Henry Thomas Buckle, Italian philosopher and historian Benedetto Croce, social reformer Josef Popper-Lynkeus, philosopher Antonio Labriola, and Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno. In particular, Jabotinsky sympathized with the ideas of Giuseppe Garibaldi because of Garibaldi&#x27;s emphasis on European nationalism. Garibaldi believed that it was necessary for the rich and poor of a country to unite through love of their homeland. The strong emphasis on nationalism translated into Jabotinsky&#x27;s own ideas about establishing a Jewish homeland.

=== Jabotinsky&#x27;s position towards Fascism ===
Jabotinsky was unsympathetic towards fascism in his early years. However, he became increasingly aligned with fascism during the 1930s, agreeing with the outlawing of strikes and militarism that fascism entailed. Leftist propaganda described Jabotinsky as a fascist during the 1930s and he was seen as a fascist by many other Zionists. Jabotinsky supported the outlawing of strikes because he was fervently anti-socialist and saw socialism as incompatible with Zionism. He was sympathetic to the ideology of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini during the 1930s. This changed when Mussolini aligned himself with Adolf Hitler, at which point Jabotinsky ceased to associate with Mussolini. However, Jabotinsky retained his belief that the goals of Zionism could only be achieved by taking over Palestine through a military effort. Jabotinsky organized the Jewish Legion which was a force of 5,000 soldiers that contributed to the British conquest of Palestine during World War I. In addition, Jabotinsky organized the Haganah in 1920 which became a central part of the Israeli army in the future. Jabotinsky ruled out the possibility of establishing a police state, whether it was under communist or fascist leadership due to his belief in the necessity of having a regime under which the individual could thrive. However, he still viewed fascism as a pragmatic option and believed that democracy had not worked well in any country except for England. Jabotinsky said that there were three common factors between fascism and Revisionist Zionism which were the denial of a class struggle, &quot;compulsory arbitration&quot; of labor disputes, and prioritizing national interests over the interests of a specific social or economic class. The organization of the Revisionist movement under Jabotinsky was flawed since Jabotinsky&#x27;s control of the movement was akin to European far-right groups in the 1930s.

===From the Irgun to the Likud===
The Irgun largely followed the Centrists&#x27; ideals but it followed them with a much more hawkish outlook towards Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Mandate, and it had an ardently nationalist vision of society and government. After the establishment of the State of Israel, it was the Irgun wing of the Revisionist Party that formed Herut, which in turn eventually formed the Gahal party when Herut and the Liberal parties formed a united list called &quot;Gush Herut Liberalim&quot; (or the Herut-Liberal Bloc). In 1973 the new Likud Party was formed by a group of parties which were dominated by the Revisionist Herut/Gahal. After the 1977 Knesset elections it became the dominant party in a governing coalition, and up to the present day it has remained an important force in Israeli politics. In the 2006 elections, Likud lost many of its seats to the Kadima party which had formed the previous year when Ariel Sharon and others split to the left from Likud. The Likud bounced back in Israel&#x27;s 2009 Knesset elections, garnering 27 seats, though still outnumbered by Kadima&#x27;s 28. In spite of the fact that these right-of-center parties favored a Likud-led coalition, a coalition in which the members of the Likud party comprised the majority; the Likud was chosen to form the coalition. The party re-emerged as the strongest party in the Knesset in the 2013 elections and today it leads the government. In the years since the 1977 election, particularly in the last decade, Likud has undergone a number of splits to the right, including the 1998 departure of Benny Begin, the son of Herut&#x27;s founder Menachem Begin (he rejoined Likud in 2008).
While the initial core group of Likud&#x27;s leaders such as Israeli Prime Ministers Begin and Yitzhak Shamir came from Likud&#x27;s Herut faction, later leaders, such as Benjamin Netanyahu (whose father was Jabotinsky&#x27;s secretary) and Ariel Sharon, have come from or moved to the &quot;pragmatic&quot; Revisionist wing.

The Revisionist idea of establishing a Jewish homeland over all of the Land of Israel played a role in shaping the ideas of members of Likud. Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, two former Israeli prime ministers and members of Likud, were both inspired by Jabotinsky&#x27;s ideas. Menachem Begin opposed relinquishing the West Bank after Israel&#x27;s victory in the Six-Day War. In addition, he opposed UN Resolution 242 because it would mean relinquishing Israeli control over part of the Land of Israel. Begin believed that the historic right of Jews to the Land of Israel came before the Palestinian claim to the land. Shamir would not compromise on the issue of the borders of the Land of Israel and opposed the Camp David Accords. Another member of Likud and prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, accepted the Oslo Accords, which was a diversion from the Revisionist idea of establishing a Jewish homeland over all of the Land of Israel.

<text>In mining, overburden (also called waste or spoil) is the material that lies above an area that lends itself to economical exploitation, such as the rock, soil, and ecosystem that lies above a coal seam or ore body. Overburden is distinct from tailings, the material that remains after economically valuable components have been extracted from the generally finely milled ore. Overburden is removed during surface mining, but is typically not contaminated with toxic components. Overburden may also be used to restore an exhausted mining site during reclamation.

Interburden is material that lies between two areas of economic interest, such as the material separating coal seams within strata.

==Analogous uses==
Overburden is also used for all soil and ancillary material above the bedrock horizon in a given area.

By analogy, overburden is also used to describe the soil and other material that lies above a specific geologic feature, such as a buried astrobleme, or above an unexcavated site of archeological interest.

In particle physics, the overburden of an underground laboratory may be important to shield the facility from cosmic radiation that can interfere with experiments.

In arboriculture, the word is also used for the soil over the top of the roots of a tree collected from the wild.

<doc id="605525" wikidata="Q6544584" url="?curid=605525" title="Life-process model of addiction">
<text>The life-process model of addiction is the view that addiction is not a disease but rather a habitual response and a source of gratification and security that can be understood only in the context of social relationships and experiences. This model of addiction is in opposition to the disease model of addiction. It was originated and advocated by Stanton Peele in his book &quot;The Truth About Addiction and Recovery&quot; (with Archie Brodsky and Mary Arnold, 1991).

Proponents of the life-process model argue that unitary biological mechanisms cannot account for addictive behavior and thus do not support using the term &quot;disease&quot;. They instead emphasize the individual&#x27;s ability to overcome addiction by augmenting life options and coping mechanics, pursuing values and purpose, repairing relationships, and expressing personal agency — all of which occur through normal human development. Indeed, the disease model impedes these natural life processes. The biological mechanisms typically claimed to underlie all forms of addiction (CREB and ΔFosB) — while psychosocial factors are considered as only tangential issues leading to lesser or greater use and exposure — were reviewed by Eric J. Nestler in 2013. The range of data opposing these assertions and disputing the chronic relapsing disease nature of addiction were reviewed by Gene M. Heyman in 2013a and 2013b, and by Stanton Peele in 2016. Peele particularly cites US and international epidemiological data indicating worsening mental health and drug use outcomes dating from the 1990s, when American investment in neuropsychiatric approaches and brain research rose to billions of dollars annually.

Stanton Peele&#x27;s Life Process Model has been further explored with his colleague Zach Rhoads, with whom he has written the book, &quot;Outgrowing Addiction&quot; and trained peer counselors in harm-reduction based organizations in the United States and Canada.

<text>The spotted dove or eastern spotted dove (Spilopelia chinensis) is a small and somewhat long-tailed pigeon that is a common resident breeding bird across its native range on the Indian subcontinent and in East and Southeast Asia. The species has been introduced to many parts of the world and feral populations have become established.

This species was formerly included in the genus &quot;Streptopelia&quot; with other turtle-doves, but studies suggest that they differ from typical members of that genus. This dove is long tailed buff brown with a white-spotted black collar patch on the back and sides of the neck. The tail tips are white and the wing coverts have light buff spots.

There are considerable plumage variations across populations within its wide range. The species is found in light forests and gardens as well as in urban areas. They fly from the ground with an explosive flutter and will sometimes glide down to a perch. It is also called the mountain dove, pearl-necked dove, lace-necked dove, and spotted turtle-dove.

==Taxonomy==

The spotted dove was formally described in 1786 by the Austrian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli and given the binomial name &quot;Columba chinensis&quot;. Scopoli based his account on &quot;La tourterelle gris de la Chine&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1782 by the French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat in the second volume of his book &quot;Voyage aux Indes orientales et à la Chine&quot;. This species was formerly included in the genus &quot;Streptopelia&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2001 found the genus was paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Columba&quot;. To create monophyletic genera the spotted dove as well as the closely related laughing dove were moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Spilopelia&quot; that had been introduced by the Swedish zoologist Carl Sundevall in 1873. Sundevall had designated &quot;Columba tigrina&quot; as the type species, a taxon that is now considered a subspecies of the spotted dove.

Several subspecies have been proposed for the plumage and size variation seen in different geographic populations. The nominate form is from China (Canton), which is also the origin of the introduced population in Hawaii. Subspecies &quot;formosa&quot; from Taiwan has been considered as doubtful and indistinguishable from the nominate population. The population in India &quot;suratensis&quot; (type locality Surat) and &quot;ceylonensis&quot; from Sri Lanka have fine rufous or buff spots on the back. There is a size reduction trend with specimens from southern India being smaller, and &quot;ceylonensis&quot; may merely be a part of this cline. The lesser and median wing-coverts are also spotted at the tip in buff. This spotting is lacking on populations further north and east of India, such as &quot;tigrina&quot;, which also differ greatly in vocalizations from the Indian forms. The population from Hainan Island is placed in &quot;hainana&quot;. Others like &quot;vacillans&quot; (=&quot;chinensis&quot;) and &quot;forresti&quot; (= &quot;tigrina&quot;) and &quot;edwardi&quot; (from Chabua = &quot;suratensis&quot;) have been considered invalid.

Five subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;Spilopelia chinensis suratensis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan
* &quot;Spilopelia chinensis ceylonensis&quot; (Reichenbach, 1851) – Sri Lanka (has shorter wings than &quot;suratensis&quot;)
* &quot;Spilopelia chinensis tigrina&quot; (Temminck, 1809) – Bangladesh and northeast India through Indochina to Philippines and the Sunda Islands
* &quot;Spilopelia chinensis chinensis&quot; (Scopoli, 1786) – northeast Myanmar to central and east China, Taiwan
* &quot;Spilopelia chinensis hainana&quot; (Hartert, 1910) – Hainan (off southeast China)

The subspecies &quot;S. c. suratensis&quot; and &quot;S. c. ceylonensis&quot; differ significantly from the other subspecies in both plumage and vocalization. This has led some ornithologists to treat &quot;S. c. suratensis&quot; as a separate species, the western spotted dove.

==Description==
The ground colour of this long and slim dove is rosy buff below shading into grey on the head and belly. There is a half collar on the back and sides of the neck made of black feathers that bifurcate and have white spots at the two tips. The median coverts have brown feathers tipped with rufous spots in the Indian and Sri Lankan subspecies which are divided at the tip by a widening grey shaft streak.

The wing feathers are dark brown with grey edges. The centre of the abdomen and vent are white. The outer tail feathers are tipped in white and become visible when the bird takes off. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults and do not acquire the neck spots until they are mature. The length ranges from 28 to 32 centimetres (11.2 to 12.8 inches).

Abnormal plumages such as leucism can sometimes occur in the wild.

==Distribution and habitat==
The spotted dove in its native range in Asia is found across a range of habitats including woodland, scrub, farmland and habitation. In India it tends to be found in the moister regions, with the laughing dove (&quot;S. senegalensis&quot;) appearing more frequently in drier areas. These doves are mostly found on the ground where they forage for seeds and grain or on low vegetation.

The species has become established in many areas outside its native range. These areas include Hawaii, southern California, Mauritius, Australia and New Zealand.

In Australia they were introduced into Melbourne in the 1860s and have since spread but there is insufficient evidence that they compete with native doves. They are now found in streets, parks, gardens, agricultural areas, and tropical scrubs in diverse locations throughout eastern Australia and around the cities and major towns across southern Australia. The original populations appear to be &quot;S. c. chinensis&quot; and &quot;S. c. tigrina&quot; in varying proportions.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Spotted doves move around in pairs or small groups as they forage on the ground for grass seeds, grains, fallen fruits and seeds of other plants. They may however take insects occasionally and have been recorded feeding on winged termites. The flight is quick with regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings. A display flight involves taking off at a steep angle with a loud clapping of the wing and then slowly gliding down with the tail spread out.
The breeding season is spread out in warm regions but tends to be in summer in the temperate ranges. In Hawaii, they breed all year round, as do all three other introduced species of doves. Males coo, bow and make aerial displays in courtship. In southern Australia, they breed mostly from September to January, and in the north in autumn. They nest mainly in low vegetation, building a flimsy cup of twigs in which two whitish eggs are laid. Nests are sometimes placed on the ground or on buildings and other structures. Both parents take part in building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. The eggs hatch after about 13 days and fledge after a fortnight. More than one brood may be raised.

The vocalizations of the spotted dove include cooing softly with a &quot;Krookruk-krukroo... kroo kroo kroo&quot; with the number of terminal &quot;kroos&quot; varying in the Indian population and absent in &quot;tigrina&quot;, &quot;chinensis&quot; and other populations to the east.

The species has been extending its range in many parts of the world. Populations may sometimes rise and fall rapidly, within a span of about five years. In the Philippines, the species may be outcompeting the &quot;Streptopelia dusumieri&quot;. Their habit of flushing into the air when disturbed makes them a hazard on airfields, often colliding with aircraft and sometimes causing damage.

<text>.ca is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Canada. The domain name registry that operates it is the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA).

Registrants can register domains at the second level (e.g., &quot;example.ca&quot;). Third-level registrations in one of the geographic third-level domains defined by the registry (e.g. &quot;example.ab.ca&quot;) were discontinued on October 12, 2010, but existing third-level domain names continue to be supported.

== Canadian Presence Requirements ==
Registrants of .ca domains must meet the Canadian Presence Requirements as defined by the registry. Examples of valid entities include:

* a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of the age of majority
* a legally recognized Canadian organization
* an Inuit, First Nation, Métis or other people indigenous to Canada
* an Indian Band as defined in the Indian Act of Canada
* a foreign resident of Canada that holds a registered Canadian trademark
* an executor, administrator or other legal representative of a person or organization that meets the requirements
* a division of the government
* the monarch of Canada

== History ==

The domain name was originally allocated by Jon Postel, operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), to John Demco of the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1987. The first .ca domain was registered by the University of Prince Edward Island in January 1988.

In 1997, at the Canadian annual Internet conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the Canadian Internet community, with a view to liberalize registration procedures and substantially improve turnaround times, decided to undertake reform of the .ca Registry.

The Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA) is a non-profit Canadian corporation that is responsible for operating the .ca Internet country code Top Level Domain (ccTLD) today. It assumed operation of the .ca ccTLD on December 1, 2000, from UBC. On April 15, 2008, CIRA registered its one millionth .ca Internet domain name.

Any .ca registration has to be ordered via a certified registrar.

== Third-level (provincial) and fourth-level (municipal) domains ==

UBC&#x27;s registry operations once favoured fourth-level names (such as .on.ca) for purely local entities or third-level names for entities operating solely within one province. Nationally incorporated companies could have a &quot;.ca&quot; domain, while provincially incorporated companies required the letters of their province, like &quot;.mb.ca&quot;. Only an entity with presence in two or more provinces was typically registered directly under .ca; this complex structure (and the long delays in getting .ca registration) caused many Canadian entities to favour the .com, .org and .net registrations, despite the then-higher cost. 

Currently, any of the above listed parties can register a domain with a name of their choosing followed directly by &quot;.ca&quot;. CIRA stopped accepting new registrations for third-level domains on October 12, 2010, citing complexity and the low number of new third domain registration as the reason for the change. As a result, the following domains at the third-level are no longer available for registration:

The second-level domain name &#x27;.gc.ca&#x27; (Government of Canada) is commonly mistaken as one of the regional domains under which CIRA will allow Government of Canada registrations. gc.ca is actually a standard domain like all other .ca domain names. CIRA does not register domain names under .gc.ca directly.

The .mil.ca second-level domain name is also a standard domain and is registered to the Department of National Defence (DND). The .mil.ca suffix is used internally by DND on its intranet, the Defence Information Network (DIN) or Defence Wide Area Network (DWAN), to distinguish intranet-only websites.

== Naming restrictions ==
Internationalized domain names (IDN) were introduced in January 2013 with a limited selection of characters (é, ë, ê, è, â, à, æ, ô, œ, ù, û, ü, ç, î, ï, ÿ) to allow French language text with diacritics. Names which differ only in diacritical accents (such as metro.ca and métro.ca) must have the same owner and same registrar. Domain names that begin with the four characters xn-- are otherwise not available for registration. Length must be 2-63 characters, including the xn-- prefix encoding for internationalised domain names.

Names which match the name of an existing generic three-letter top level domain (such as .com.ca) or the Canadian top level country code (.ca) are reserved and therefore not available for new registrations. Certain expletives are not accepted as names. Municipal names of individual cities and localities within Canada are also reserved nationwide, along with village.ca, hamlet.ca, town.ca, city.ca, ville.ca and the names of Canadian provinces.

There are a handful of existing .ca registered names as short as two characters in length, but these tend to be rare as two-letter combinations matching any existing country-code TLDs were reserved in the past. Exceptions were typically names registered before the restriction was introduced, such as the Canadian Governor General at gg.ca.

Names which exist at any of the levels (.ca, an individual province or territory, or an individual city) are blocked in their availability elsewhere in the .ca hierarchy. Registration, if it can be done at all, requires manual intervention by the prospective registrar as the permission of all existing registrant(s) must be obtained by CIRA. For instance, if the province of New Brunswick were to want to register &quot;gouv.nb.ca&quot;, CIRA&#x27;s normal automated WHOIS and registration tools would simply return the following error:
The domain name provided conflicts with at least one other registered domain name (e.g. xyz.ca conflicts with xyz.on.ca). Registering this domain name requires permission from the Registrant(s) that already holds the domain name(s): gouv.on.ca, gouv.pe.ca, gouv.qc.ca. Contact CIRA for more information.
Since Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Quebec already use &quot;gouv&quot; on their provincial second-level domains for the French-language versions of their government websites, this domain is unavailable through the normal registration process. However, with the agreement of these three parties New Brunswick would indeed be able to register and use gouv.nb.ca.

Existing third-level domain registrants looking to obtain the corresponding second-level domain are normally advised to use the same initial registrar for both names.

== Expired domains ==
After a thirty-day redemption period, intended to provide the original registrant one final chance to reclaim a suspended name, the expired names are assigned a to-be-released (TBR) status. These names are made available through a weekly auction process, in which lists of available names are posted online and advance bids are placed by prospective registrants through the various .ca registrars.

Domains which receive no bids are then released and made openly available for new registrations.

<doc id="605532" wikidata="Q2593428" url="?curid=605532" title="Word clock">
<text>In digital audio electronics, a word clock or wordclock (sometimes sample clock, which can have a broader meaning) is a clock signal used to synchronise other devices, such as digital audio tape machines and compact disc players, which interconnect via digital audio signals. Word clock is so named because it clocks each audio sample. Samples are represented in data words. 

S/PDIF, AES/EBU, MADI, ADAT, and TDIF are some of the formats that use a word clock. Various audio over Ethernet systems use communication protocols to distribute word clock. The device which generates the word clock is the clock source for all the other audio devices.

The signal is used for synchronizing digital audio signals between devices, such as CD players, audio I/O cards, etc. It allows all the components in the signal path to process the data and remain synchronized with each other.

==Comparison to timecode==
Word clock should not be confused with timecode; word clock is used entirely to keep a perfectly timed and constant bitrate to avoid timing errors that can cause data transmission errors. Timecode is metadata &quot;about&quot; the media data being transmitted. Time code can be used as an initial phase reference for jam sync using the word clock as the frequency reference.

==Over coax cable==
Professional digital audio equipment may have a word clock input or output to synchronize timing between multiple devices. Although the electrical characteristics of the word clock signal have not been completely standardized, some characteristics should always apply. Items that should remain consistent are TTL level, a 75ohm output impedance, 75ohm cables and a 75ohm terminating resistor at the end of a chain or cable.

Proper termination of the word clock signal with a 75ohm resistor is important. It prevents the clock signal from reflecting back into the cable and causing false detection of extra 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s. Some digital equipment includes a switchable terminator, some include a hardwired terminator and others have no terminator at all. An unfortunate aspect is that some equipment manuals do not indicate whether a hardwired terminator is included.

A &quot;chain&quot; connection from the source through the receivers may increase jitter. Using clock distributing devices for parallel transmission is a better method. The length and quality of coaxial cables are important.

==Over AES3==
The AES11 standard defines a means for carrying a word clock over an AES3 connection. In this context, the word clock is known as a Digital Audio Reference Signal (DARS).

In annex B, the AES11 standard also describes common practice in transmitting and receiving a plain word clock signal. This is not an attempt to standardize it, the annex is informative only.

<text>.tk is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand in the South Pacific. 

The .tk TLD is managed by Teletok, a local telecommunications company who outsourced the domain registry operation to a Dutch company Freenom, who was additionally also acting as a registrar. As Freenom offered free registration, the .tk ending was often associated with malicious activities like phishing, spam and cybersquatting. In 2023, Freenom stopped offering new .tk registrations in their registrar business as a result of a lawsuit with Meta. Their registry operations for other registrars were not affected by this. Freenom announced it would exit the domain registry and registrar business in February 2024. 

Teletok opened negotiations with the domain registry operator of .nz, for help in managing .tk after Freenom&#x27;s exit. 

==Overview==
Tokelau allows any individual to register domain names. Users and small businesses were able to register any number of domain names free of charge (with some restrictions). In addition to the name itself, users can opt to forward their web traffic using HTML frames and their email traffic, with a maximum of 250 addresses per user log in, or use full DNS, either via their own or third-party servers, or by using Dot TK&#x27;s servers. There are content restrictions for free domains, banning sites containing sexual content, drug use, hate speech, firearms, and spam or copyright infringement. Dot TK requires free domains to have a regular traffic of visitors, and if a domain&#x27;s redirect target does not work (even temporarily) the domain is taken offline. If a domain violates any of these terms, it is replaced by a Sedo advertisement page, and no advance warning is given.

Dot TK also provides .tk websites with the option to join a network called TiKinet, a close-knit network that links sites to each other based on keywords called TiKilinks. The network is expected to increase traffic to the websites, many of which are personal sites and blogs operated by individuals who otherwise would have no way to advertise their sites.

To be able to get a &quot;special&quot; .tk domain name the user must buy it. This includes trademark domain names for most Fortune 500 companies and common dictionary terms. Paid domain names cost US$19.90 for the first two years. Potentially valuable names with fewer than 4 characters are similarly unavailable for free registration and must generally be purchased at a premium price of over $1000.

Dot TK launched a new service called TweaK for Twitter users in April 2010, offering a URL shortening service that uses less space than many others, and for Facebook where the user can rename Facebook account pages with a .tk name.

In 2016, Nominet released a world map where each country was resized according to the popularity of its top-level domain. The .tk domain ranked first worldwide with 31,311,498 registered domain names (China (.cn) ranked 2nd with 16,810,737 registered domain names). The revenues from the .tk top-level domain business represent about of the island&#x27;s annual income.

==Criticism==
In 2006, McAfee conducted a survey in which they claim out of the 95 percent most trafficked web sites, .tk domains were twice as likely as the global average to be used for &quot;unwanted behaviours&quot;, including scams such as phishing and spam. However, in 2008 McAfee reported that the threat of scams like phishing and spam was significantly reduced with .tk and that other top level domains such as .com and .net were much more used in such scams.

A 2011 report by the Anti Phishing Working Group blamed Tokelau&#x27;s bad reputation on the registry Dot TK. It acquired the right to operate the top level domain and is responsible for the current free registration system. .tk domains logged 2533 of 11768 (~21.5%) total phishing attacks in the second half of 2010 Internet-wide.

A 2018 report by Michelle Base-Bursey stated that, &quot;The third most prevalent TLD for phishing attacks is .tk, the country code for Tokelau, a territory north of New Zealand in the South Pacific.&quot;

In 2016, the Anti-Phishing Working Group stated that the .cc, .com, .pw, and .tk domain names accounted for 75% of all malicious domain registrations.

On 3 March 2023, Meta filed a lawsuit against Freenom alleging cybersquatting violations and trademark infringement, and new domain registrations were halted. The lawsuit references a 2021 study on the abuse of domains conducted by Interisle Consulting Group, which discovered that the ccTLDs operated by Freenom made up five of the top ten TLDs most abused by phishers. In November 2023, ICANN terminated its registrar accreditation agreement with Freenom due to failure to cure breaches of the agreement within 21 days of notice. On 12 February 2024, Freenom announced that it had settled the lawsuit with Meta under undisclosed terms, and that it would exit the domain name and registry business.

By early March 2024, around 99% of Freenom domains (mostly those under .tk, .cf, and .gq), roughly 12.6 million, were no longer accessible, although it was reported that some paid domains were still active. Most of these domains hosted their DNS with Cloudflare, which consequently saw a 22% drop in its number of hosted domains.

<text>.uk is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the United Kingdom. It was first registered in July 1985, seven months after the original generic top-level domains such as .com and the first country code after .us.

, it is the fifth most popular top-level domain worldwide (after .com, .cn, .de and .net), with over 10 million registrations.

.uk has used OpenDNSSEC since March 2010.

==History==

In October 1984, RFC 920 set out the creation of ccTLDs using country codes derived from the corresponding two-letter code in the ISO 3166-1 list. &quot;GB&quot; is the UK&#x27;s ISO 3166 country code. However, the UK academic network Name Registration Scheme, JANET NRS, had defined &quot;UK&quot; as the top-level domain a few months before the compilation of the ISO-derived list. Consequently, .uk was chosen and registered on 24 July 1985. .gb was reserved but never widely used and it is no longer possible to register domains under that ccTLD.

As with other ccTLDs in the early days it was originally delegated by Jon Postel to a &quot;trusted person&quot; to manage. Andrew McDowell at UCL was assigned .uk, the first country code delegation. In time, he passed it to Willie Black at the UK Education and Research Networking Association (UKERNA). Originally, domain requests were emailed, manually screened by and then forwarded to the UK Naming Committee before being processed by UKERNA. Membership of this committee was restricted to a group of high-end ISPs who were part of a formal peering arrangement.

The Naming Committee was organised as a mailing list to which all proposed names were circulated. The members would consider the proposals under a ruleset that insisted that all domain names should be very close if not identical to a registered business name of the registrant. Members of the Naming Committee could object to any name, and if at least a small number of objections were received, the name was refused.

By the mid-1990s the growth of the Internet, and particularly the advent of the World Wide Web was pushing requests for domain name registrations up to levels that were not manageable by a group of part-time volunteers. Oliver Smith of Demon Internet forced the issue by providing the committee with a series of automated tools, called the &quot;automaton&quot;, which formalised and automated the naming process end to end. This allowed many more registrations to be processed far more reliably and rapidly, and inspired individuals such as Ivan Pope to explore more entrepreneurial approaches to registration.

Various plans were put forward for the possible management of the domain, mostly Internet service providers seeking to stake a claim, each of which were naturally unacceptable to the rest of the committee. In response to this Black, as the .uk Name, stepped up with a bold proposal for a not-for-profit commercial entity to deal with the .uk domain properly. Commercial interests initially balked at this, but with widespread support Nominet UK was formed in 1996 to be the .uk Network Information Centre, a role which it continues to this day.

The general form of the rules (i.e. which domains can be registered and whether to allow second level domains) was set by the Naming Committee. Nominet has not made major changes to the rules, although it has introduced a new second level domain .me.uk for individuals.

Until 10 June 2014 it was not possible to register a domain name directly under .uk (such as &quot;internet.uk&quot;); it was only possible as a third-level domain (such as &quot;internet.co.uk&quot;).

However, some domains delegated before the creation of Nominet UK were in existence even before 10 June 2014, for example &quot;mod.uk&quot; (Ministry of Defence), &quot;parliament.uk&quot; (Parliament), &quot;bl.uk&quot; and &quot;british-library.uk&quot; (the British Library), &quot;nls.uk&quot; (the National Library of Scotland), &quot;nhs.uk&quot; (The National Health Service), and &quot;jet.uk&quot; (UKAEA as operator of the Joint European Torus experimental fusion tokamak).

Currently, management of the .uk domain name is delegated by IANA to Nominet UK. It is possible to directly register a domain name with Nominet UK at £80+VAT as of 2021, but it is faster and cheaper to do it via a Nominet-accredited domain registrar costing in the region of £10+VAT in 2021.

==.uk right of registration==
New registrations directly under .uk have been accepted by Nominet since 10 June 2014 08:00 BST; however, there was a reservation period for existing customers who already had a .co.uk, .org.uk, .me.uk, .net.uk, .ltd.uk or .plc.uk domain to claim the corresponding .uk domain, which ran until 06:00 BST on 25 June 2019.

If a domain was registered before 23:59 UTC on 28 October 2013 the user had the rights to the equivalent .uk domain (providing there was no other corresponding .co.uk, .org.uk, me.uk, .ltd.uk, .plc.uk or .net.uk registered). For example, if &quot;your-company.co.uk&quot; was held since 2 October 2013, the registrant of &#x27;your-company.co.uk&#x27; had the reserved right of registering &quot;your-company.uk&quot;, up until 06:00 BST on 25 June 2019. 123-reg and NamesCo both created such domains for their customers for free but then began demanding payment in September 2019.

==Second-level domains==

===Active===
* .ac.uk – academic (tertiary education, further education colleges, research establishments (such as the British Antarctic Survey) and learned societies)
* .bl.uk – used solely for the British Library
* .co.uk – commercial entities and purposes (the most popular second-level domain for .uk, majority of .uk registrations are on &quot;.co.uk&quot; domain)
* .gov.uk – government (central, devolved and local)
*.judiciary.uk – judiciary of England and Wales
* .ltd.uk – limited companies
* .me.uk – personal names
* .mod.uk – armed forces and Ministry of Defence establishments and systems
* .net.uk – ISPs and network companies (unlike .net, use is restricted to these users)
* .nhs.uk – NHS organisations and trusts
* .nic.uk – network use only (reserved exclusively for Nominet UK)
* .org.uk – not-for-profit entities
* .parliament.uk – Parliament of the United Kingdom and the devolved national parliaments and assemblies
* .plc.uk – public limited companies
* .police.uk – police forces in the UK and law enforcement organisations. 
* .rct.uk – used solely for the Royal Collection Trust
* .royal.uk – used solely for the royal family website
* .sch.uk – local education authorities, schools, primary and secondary education, community education
* .ukaea.uk – used solely for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority

.co.uk, .ltd.uk, .me.uk, .net.uk, .nic.uk, .org.uk, .plc.uk and .sch.uk are managed by Nominet UK and except for .nic.uk are available for registration by the public (though they all carry various degrees of restrictions). Other second-level domains are managed by various government agencies, and generally more strongly controlled.

===Inactive===
* .govt.uk – former government domain, now deleted and replaced by .gov.uk.
* .orgn.uk – former non-profit organisations domain, now deleted and replaced by .org.uk.
* .lea.uk – local education authorities; since fallen out of use.
* .mil.uk – the Ministry of Defence have always used .mod.uk for their external domain, but use .mil.uk on their private network. .mil.uk exists only as a CNAME for .mod.uk in the .uk zone file.

===Rejected===

* .cym.uk – A second-level domain for Wales; it did not have support of the Welsh Internet community, with a .cym domain being proposed, though later rejected. Top-level domains of .cymru and .wales have since been delegated to the root in 2014.
* .scot.uk – A second level domain for Scotland; it was rejected by Nominet. A top-level domain of .scot approved on 10 June 2014 and been delegated to the root since 13 June 2014.
* .sco.uk – A second level domain for Scotland.
* .soc.uk – proposed for Social and Society use.

==Allocation of domain names==
Allocations are on a strict first-come, first-served basis to qualified applicants. There are no territorial restrictions: applicants need not have any connection to the UK other than those outlined below for .ltd.uk and other restricted domains.

.co.uk is by far the most used of the domains, followed by .org.uk then .me.uk. .plc.uk and .ltd.uk are only rarely used. The number of new registrations for each of the different .uk domains on a month by month basis can be seen on the Nominet UK website.

The intended restriction of .co.uk to companies is purely nominal; in practice it is open to any and all applicants. Likewise, whilst .org.uk is for organisations, there are no restrictions on registering domains. While .me.uk originally had no restrictions on registrants it has since been tightened up to require registrants to be natural persons (i.e. not companies, etc.).

However, registrants in .ltd.uk must be, and remain, private limited companies incorporated under the UK Companies Acts. In addition, names can only be registered if they correspond (in accordance with the algorithm in the rules of registration) with the exact company name, as recorded at the companies registry at Companies House. The same conditions apply for public limited companies which wish to use a .plc.uk domain name. Neither of these domains is widely used.

.net.uk is more open, but the Nominet regulations still mean that a registrant must be an ISP, or a similar body, and that the domain is not used for providing services to end-users. .nic.uk, however, is limited solely to domains operated by Nominet.

.ac.uk domains are intended for the use of higher education institutions and further education colleges, and are also used by some academic support bodies such as the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service public research establishments, and learned societies such as the Royal Society. Primary and secondary education uses .sch.uk.

==sch.uk==
Unusually, .sch.uk domains are allocated at the fourth level, with the third level being taken up by the name of the local authority (LA, previously LEA or local education authority) e.g. schoolname.leaname.sch.uk. For example, the Little Ilford School in Newham has the domain name littleilford.newham.sch.uk and the West Exe School in Exeter, Devon has the domain name westexe.devon.sch.uk. Previously applications were made in the normal way, but after Nominet came to an arrangement with the education authorities, one domain per school was issued automatically. Those that had already used another domain were still given one and were able to redirect it to their main domain.

<text>In music, hocket is the rhythmic linear technique using the alternation of notes, pitches, or chords. In medieval practice of hocket, a single melody is shared between two (or occasionally more) voices such that alternately one voice sounds while the other rests.

==History==
In European music, hocket or hoquet was used primarily in vocal and choral music of the 13th and early 14th centuries. It was a predominant characteristic of music of the Notre Dame school, during the &quot;ars antiqua&quot;, in which it was found in sacred vocal music and string compositions. In the 14th century, this compositional device was most often found in secular vocal music. Although the term is in reference to this secular music of the 13th and 14th centuries in France, the technique under other names can be heard in different types of music across the world.

The term originated in reference to medieval French motets, though the technique remains in common use in contemporary music. Examples include Louis Andriessen&#x27;s &quot;Hoketus&quot;; some popular music of the United States (funk, stereo panning, the guitar duos Robert Fripp/Adrian Belew in King Crimson, and Tom Verlaine/Richard Lloyd in Television); the Indonesian gamelan music (interlocking patterns shared between two instruments—called &quot;imbal&quot; in Java and &quot;kotekan&quot; in Bali); Andean &quot;siku&quot; music (two panpipe sets sharing the full number of pitches); Ukrainian and Russian &quot;kuvytsi&quot; (panpipe) ensembles, Lithuanian &quot;skudučiai&quot; (panpipe) ensembles, handbell music (tunes being distributed between two or more players), rara music in rara festival street processions in Haiti, as well as in the gagá in the Dominican Republic. Hocket is used in many African cultures such as the Ba-Benzélé (featured on Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Watermelon Man,&quot; see Pygmy music), Mbuti, Basarwa (Khoisan), the Gumuz tribe from the Blue Nile Province (Sudan), and Gogo (Tanzania). It is also evident in drum and bugle corps drumline music, colloquially known as &quot;split parts&quot; or simply &quot;splits&quot;. Segments of the trombone ensemble in Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Braggin&#x27; in Brass&quot; are a rare jazz instance of hocket.

The use of hocketing is in reference to a broken melody line between two or more instruments or vocals, many contemporary artists freely integrate hocketing techniques with other composition devices such as alternating melodies, trading multiple melodic sections, or translating them between instruments or switching intervals of melody, or composing interlocking melodies shared between instruments. Hocket technique typically implied sharing a vocal on the vowels or having a sequence of notes spliced between instruments or vocals with certain notes in the melody being the moments of exchange. Interlocking notes are not a phenomenon in music unique to hocketing, alternating melody techniques have many uses through composition such as enabling certain vocals or instruments to become more audible than others, or effectively combining into a sequential chord, or by splitting the vocals or instruments between audio sources. While hoquet is an antiquated term and in contemporary practice is usually used alongside other melodic compositional devices and experimentation, it has found use in funk, and stereo panning, among other modern techniques typically used in similar style, and in multiple track recordings is often used artificially while editing arrangements of the song.

The group Dirty Projectors have used hocketing and other antiquated techniques prominently as an element of their music, experimenting with instruments as well as vocals in the style of hocketing or melodic intervals, particularly with interlocking or alternating melodies, though not all these techniques are explicitly the &quot;hoquet&quot; method. The group&#x27;s frontman Dave Longstreth has expressed his interest and surprise in the medieval origins of the experimental techniques in use by the band.

==Etymology==
The term comes from the French word &quot;hoquet&quot; (in Old French also &quot;hocquet&quot;, &quot;hoket&quot;, or &quot;ocquet&quot;) meaning &quot;a shock, sudden interruption, hitch, hiccup&quot;, and similar onomatopeic words in Celtic, Breton, Dutch and other languages. The words were Latinized as &quot;hoquetus&quot;, &quot;(h)oketus&quot;, and &quot;(h)ochetus&quot;. Earlier etymologies tried to show derivation from Arabic, but they are no longer favored.

<text>The Music of Bali, Bali is an Indonesian island that shares in the gamelan and other Indonesian musical styles. Bali, however, has its own techniques and styles, including kecak, a form of singing that imitates the sound of monkeys. In addition, the island is home to several unique kinds of gamelan, including the gamelan jegog, gamelan gong gede, gamelan gambang, gamelan selunding and gamelan semar pegulingan, the cremation music angklung and the processional music bebonangan. Modern popular styles include gamelan gong kebyar, dance music which developed during the Dutch occupation and 1950s era joged bumbung, another popular dance style. In Balinese music you can also hear metallophones, gongs and xylophones.

==Characteristics==
Balinese music can be compared to Javanese music, especially that of the pre-Islamic period. During that time, Javanese tonal systems were imported to Bali.

Balinese gamelan, a form of Indonesian classical music, is louder, swifter and more aggressive than Sundanese and Javanese music. Balinese gamelan also features more archaic instrumentation than modern Sundanese and Javanese gamelans. Balinese instruments include bronze and bamboo xylophones. Gongs and a number of gong chimes, are used, such as the solo instrument trompong, and a variety of percussion instruments like cymbals, bells, drums and the anklung (a bamboo rattle). There are two sizes of bamboo flutes, both used in theatrical music, and a rebab (two-stringed spike fiddle).

Modern forms of Balinese gamelan include kebyar, an energetic style played by clubs, which generally compose their own music. An extensive study of gamelan gong kebyar is found in &quot;Gamelan Gong Kebyar: The Art of Twentieth-Century Balinese Music&quot; (2000) by Michael Tenzer, and .

<text>The Espada Acequia, or Piedras Creek Aqueduct, was built by Franciscan friars in 1731 in what is now San Antonio, Texas, United States. It was built to supply irrigation water to the lands near Mission San Francisco de la Espada, today part of San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. The acequia is still in use today and is an National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark and a National Historic Landmark.

==Irrigation system==

Mission Espada&#x27;s &quot;acequia&quot; (irrigation) system can still be seen today. The main ditch, or &quot;acequia madre&quot;, continues to carry water to the mission and its former farmlands. This water is still used by residents living on these neighboring lands.

The initial survival of a new mission depended upon the planting and harvesting of crops. In south central Texas, intermittent rainfall and the need for a reliable water source made the design and installation of an acequia system a high priority. Irrigation was so important to Spanish colonial settlers that they measured cropland in &quot;suertes&quot; -the amount of land that could be watered in one day.

The use of acequias was originally brought to the arid regions of Spain by the Romans and the Moors. When Franciscan missionaries arrived in the desert Southwest they found the system worked well in the hot, dry environment. In some areas, like New Mexico, it blended in easily with the irrigation system already in use by the Puebloan Native Americans.

In order to distribute water to the missions along the San Antonio River, Franciscan missionaries oversaw the construction of seven gravity-flow ditches, dams, and at least one aqueduct—a network that irrigated approximately of land. The acequia not only conducted potable water and irrigation, but also powered a mill.

Mission Espada has survived from its beginnings to the present day as a community center that still supports a Catholic parish and religious education, however a school originally opened by the Sisters of the Incarnate Word and Blessed Sacrament was closed in 1967.

<text>Clinical neuropsychologyis a sub-field of cognitive science and psychology concerned with the applied science of brain-behaviour relationships. Clinical neuropsychologists use this knowledge in the assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and or rehabilitation of patients across the lifespan with neurological, medical, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, as well as other cognitive and learning disorders. The branch of neuropsychology associated with children and young people is called pediatric neuropsychology.

Clinical neuropsychology is a specialized form of clinical psychology with stringent laws in place to maintain evidence as a focal point of treatment and research within the field. The assessment and rehabilitation of neuropsychopathologies is the focus for a clinical neuropsychologist. A clinical neuropsychologist must be able to determine whether a symptom(s) was caused by an injury to the head. This is done by interviewing the patient, then determining what actions should be taken to best help the patient. Another duty of a clinical neuropsychologist is to find cerebral abnormalities and possible correlations. Evidence based practice in both research and treatment is paramount to appropriate clinical neuropsychological practice.

Assessment is primarily by way of neuropsychological tests, but also includes patient history, qualitative observation and may draw on findings from neuroimaging and other diagnostic medical procedures. Clinical neuropsychology requires an in-depth knowledge of: neuroanatomy, neurobiology, psychopharmacology and neuropathology.

==History==
During the late 1800s, brain–behavior relationships were interpreted by European physicians who observed and identified behavioural syndromes that were related with focal brain dysfunction.

Clinical neuropsychology is a fairly new practice in comparison to other specialty fields in psychology with history going back to the 1960s. The specialty focus of clinical neuropsychology evolved slowly into a more defined whole as interest grew. Threads from neurology, clinical psychology, psychiatry, cognitive psychology, and psychometrics all have been woven together to create the intricate tapestry of clinical neuropsychology, a practice which is very much so still evolving. The history of clinical neuropsychology is long and complicated due to its ties to so many older practices. Researchers like Thomas Willis (1621–1675) who has been credited with creating neurology, John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911) who theorized that cognitive processes occurred in specific parts of the brain, Paul Broca (1824–1880) and Karl Wernicke (1848–1905) who studied the human brain in relation to psychopathology, Jean Martin Charcot (1825–1893) who apprenticed Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) who created the psychoanalytic theory all contributed to clinical medicine which later contributed to clinical neuropsychology. The field of psychometrics contributed to clinical neuropsychology through individuals such as Francis Galton (1822–1911) who collected quantitative data on physical and sensory characteristics, Karl Pearson (1857–1936) who established the statistics which psychology now relies on, Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) who created the first psychology lab, his student Charles Spearman (1863–1945) who furthered statistics through discoveries like factor analysis, Alfred Binet (1857–1911) and his apprentice Theodore Simon (1872–1961) who together made the Binet-Simon scale of intellectual development, and Jean Piaget (1896–1980) who studied child development. Studies in intelligence testing made by Lewis Terman (1877–1956) who updated the Binet-Simon scale to the Stanford-Binet intelligence scale, Henry Goddard (1866–1957) who developed different classification scales, and Robert Yerkes (1876–1956) who was in charge of the Army Alpha and Beta tests also all contributed to where clinical neuropsychology is today.

Clinical neuropsychology focuses on the brain and goes back to the beginning of the 20th century. As a clinician a clinical neuropsychologist offers their services by addressing three steps; assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. The term clinical neuropsychologist was first made by Sir William Osler on April 16, 1913. While clinical neuropsychology was not a focus until the 20th century evidence of brain and behavior treatment and studies are seen as far back as the neolithic area when trephination, a crude surgery in which a piece of the skull is removed, has been observed in skulls. As a profession, clinical neuropsychology is a subspecialty beneath clinical psychology. During World War I (1914–1918) the early term shell shock was first observed in soldiers who survived the war. This was the beginning of efforts to understand traumatic events and how they affected people. During the Great Depression (1929–1941) further stressors caused shell shock like symptoms to emerge. In World War II (1939–1945) the term shell shock was changed to battle fatigue and clinical neuropsychology became even more involved with attempting to solve the puzzle of peoples&#x27; continued signs of trauma and distress. The Veterans Administration or VA was created in 1930 which increased the call for clinical neuropsychologists and by extension the need for training. The Korean (1950–1953) and Vietnam Wars (1960–1973) further solidified the need for treatment by trained clinical neuropsychologists. In 1985 the term post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD was coined and the understanding that traumatic events of all kinds could cause PTSD started to evolve.

The relationship between human behavior and the brain is the focus of clinical neuropsychology as defined by Meir in 1974. There are two subdivisions of clinical neuropsychology which draw much focus; organic and environmental natures. Ralph M. Reitan, Arthur L. Benton, and A.R. Luria are all past neuropsychologists whom believed and studied the organic nature of clinical neuropsychology. Alexander Luria is the Russian neuropsychologist responsible for the origination of clinical psychoneurological assessment after WWII. Building upon his originative contribution connecting the voluntary and involuntary functions influencing behavior, Luria further conjoins the methodical structures and associations of neurological processes in the brain. Luria developed the &#x27;combined motor method&#x27; to measure thought processes based on the reaction times when three simultaneous tasks are appointed that require a verbal response. On the other side, environmental nature of clinical neuropsychology did not appear until more recently and is characterized by treatments such as behavior therapy. The relationship between physical brain abnormalities and the presentation of psychopathology is not completely understood, but this is one of the questions which clinical neuropsychologists hope to answer in time. In 1861 the debate over human potentiality versus localization began. The two sides argued over how human behavior presented in the brain. Paul Broca postulated that cognitive problems could be caused by physical damage to specific parts of the brain based on a case study of his in which he found a lesion on the brain of a deceased patient who had presented the symptom of being unable to speak, that portion of the brain is now known as Broca&#x27;s Area. In 1874 Carl Wernicke also made a similar observation in a case study involving a patient with a brain lesion whom was unable to comprehend speech, the part of the brain with the lesion is now deemed Wernicke&#x27;s Area. Both Broca and Wernicke believed and studied the theory of localization. On the other hand, equal potentiality theorists believed that brain function was not based on a single piece of the brain but rather on the brain as a whole. Marie J.P Flourens conducted animal studies in which he found that the amount of brain tissue damaged directly affected the amount that behavior ability was altered or damaged. Kurt Goldstein observed the same idea as Flourens except in veterans who had fought in World War I. In the end, despite all of the disagreement, neither theory completely explains the human brains complexity. Thomas Hughlings Jackson created a theory which was thought to be a possible solution. Jackson believed that both potentiality and localization were in part correct and that behavior was made by multiple parts of the brain working collectively to cause behaviors, and Luria (1966–1973) furthered Jackson&#x27;s theory.

==The job==
Neuropsychologists commonly work in hospitals. There are three main variations in which a clinical neuropsychologist may work at a hospital: as an employee, consultant, or independent practitioner. A clinical neuropsychologist working as an employee of a hospital would receive a salary, benefits, and have a contract for employment. The hospital is in charge of legal and financial responsibilities for their neuropsychologists. The second option of working as a consultant implies that the clinical neuropsychologist is part of a private practice or is a member of a physicians group. In this scenario, the clinical neuropsychologist may work in the hospital like the employee of the hospital but all financial and legal responsibilities go through the group which the clinical neuropsychologist is a part of. The third option is to be an independent practitioner, who works alone and may even have their office outside of the hospital or rent a room in the hospital. In the third case, the clinical neuropsychologist is completely on their own and in charge of their own financial and legal responsibilities.

===Assessment===
Assessments are used in clinical neuropsychology to find brain psychopathologies of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional variety. Physical evidence is not always readily visible so clinical neuropsychologists must rely on assessments to tell them the extent of the damage. The cognitive strengths and weaknesses of the patient are assessed to help narrow down the possible causes of the brain pathology. A clinical neuropsychologist is expected to help educate the patient on what is happening to them so that the patient can understand how to work with their own cognitive deficits and strengths. An assessment should accomplish many goals such as; gauge consequences of impairments to quality of life, compile symptoms and the change in symptoms over time, and assess cognitive strengths and weaknesses. Accumulation of the knowledge earned from the assessment is then dedicated to developing a treatment plan based on the patient&#x27;s individual needs. An assessment can also help the clinical neuropsychologist gage the impact of medications and neurosurgery on a patient. Behavioral neurology and neuropsychology tools can be standardized or psychometric tests and observational data collected on the patient to help build an understanding of the patient and what is happening with them. There are essential prerequisites which must be present in a patient in order for the assessment to be effective; concentration, comprehension, and motivation and effort.
Lezak lists six primary reasons neuropsychological assessments are carried out: diagnosis, patient care and its planning, treatment planning, treatment evaluation, research and forensic neuropsychology. To conduct a comprehensive assessment will typically take several hours and may need to be conducted over more than a single visit. Even the use of a screening battery covering several cognitive domains may take 1.5–2 hours. At the commencement of the assessment it is important to establish a good rapport with the patient and ensure they understand the nature and aims of the assessment.

Neuropsychological assessment can be carried out from two basic perspectives, depending on the purpose of assessment. These methods are normative or individual. Normative assessment, involves the comparison of the patient&#x27;s performance against a representative population. This method may be appropriate in investigation of an adult onset brain insult such as traumatic brain injury or stroke. Individual assessment may involve serial assessment, to establish whether declines beyond those which are expected to occur with normal aging, as with dementia or another neurodegenerative condition.

Assessment can be further subdivided into sub-sections:

===History taking===
Neuropsychological assessments usually commence with a clinical interview as a means of collecting a history, which is relevant to the interpretation of any later neuropsychological tests. In addition, this interview provides qualitative information about the patient&#x27;s ability to act in a socially apt manner, organise and communicate information effectively and provide an indication as to the patient&#x27;s mood, insight and motivation. It is only within the context of a patient&#x27;s history that an accurate interpretation of their test data and thus a diagnosis can be made. The clinical interview should take place in a quiet area free from distractions. Important elements of a history include demographic information, description of presenting problem, medical history (including any childhood or developmental problems, psychiatric and psychological history), educational and occupational history (and if any legal history and military history.)

===Selection of neuropsychological tests===
It is not uncommon for patients to be anxious about being tested; explaining that tests are designed so that they will challenge everyone and that no one is expected to answer all questions correctly may be helpful. An important consideration of any neuropsychological assessment is a basic coverage of all major cognitive functions. The most efficient way to achieve this is the administration of a battery of tests covering: attention, visual perception and reasoning, learning and memory, verbal function, construction, concept formation, executive function, motor abilities and emotional status. Beyond this basic battery, choices of neuropsychological tests to be administered are mainly made on the basis of which cognitive functions need to be evaluated in order to fulfill the assessment objectives.

===Report writing===
Following a neuropsychological assessment it is important to complete a comprehensive report based on the assessment conducted. The report is for other clinicians, as well as the patient and their family, so it is important to avoid jargon or the use of language which has different clinical and lay meanings (e.g. intellectually disabled as the correct clinical term for an IQ below 70, but offensive in lay language). The report should cover background to the referral, relevant history, reasons for assessment, neuropsychologists observations of patient&#x27;s behaviour, test administered and results for cognitive domains tested, any additional findings (e.g. questionnaires for mood) and finish the report with a summary and recommendations. In the summary it is important to comment on what the profile of results indicates regarding the referral question. The recommendations section contains practical information to assist the patient and family, or improve the management of the patient&#x27;s condition.

==Educational requirements of different countries==
The educational requirements for becoming a clinical neuropsychologist differ between countries. In some countries it may be necessary to complete a clinical psychology degree, before specialising with further studies in clinical neuropsychology, while other countries offer clinical neuropsychology courses to students who have completed 4 years of psychology studies. All clinical neuropsychologists require a postgraduate qualification, whether it be a Masters or Doctorate (PhD, PsyD or D.Psych).

===Australia===
To become a clinical neuropsychologist in Australia requires the completion of a 3-year Australian Psychology Accreditation Council (APAC) approved undergraduate degree in psychology, a 1-year psychology honours, followed by a 2-year Masters or 3-year Doctorate of Psychology (D.Psych) in clinical neuropsychology. These courses involve coursework (lectures, tutorials, practicals etc.), supervised practice placements and the completion of a research thesis.
Masters and D.Psych courses involve the same amount of coursework units, but differ in the amount of supervised placements undertaken and length of research thesis. Masters courses require a minimum of 1,000 hours (125 days) and D.Psych courses require a minimum of 1,500 hours (200 days), it is mandatory that these placements expose students to acute neurology/neurosurgery, rehabilitation, psychiatric, geriatric and paediatric populations.

===Canada===
To become a clinical neuropsychologist in Canada requires the completion of a 4-year honours degree in psychology and a 4-year doctoral degree in clinical neuropsychology. Often a 2-year master&#x27;s degree is required before commencing the doctoral degree. The doctoral degree involves coursework and practical experience (practicum and internship). Practicum is between 600 and 1,000 hours of practical application of skills acquired in the program. At least 300 hours must be supervised, face-to-face client contact. The practicum is intended to prepare students for the internship/residency. Internships/residencies are a year long experience in which the student functions as a neuropsychologist, under supervision. Currently, there are 3 CPA-accredited Clinical Neuropsychology internships/residencies in Canada, although other unaccredited ones exist. Prior to commencing the internship students must have completed all doctoral coursework, received approval for their thesis proposal (if not completed the thesis) and the 600 hours of practicum.

===United Kingdom===
To become a clinical neuropsychologist in the UK, a prior qualification as a clinical or educational psychologist as recognised by the Health Professions Council, followed by further postgraduate study in clinical neuropsychology is required. In its entirety, education to become a clinical neuropsychologist in the UK consists of the completion of a 3-year British Psychological Society accredited undergraduate degree in psychology, 3-year Doctorate in clinical (usually D.Clin.Psy.) or educational psychology (D.Ed.Psy.), followed by a 1-year Masters (MSc) or 9-month Postgraduate Diploma (PgDip) in Clinical Neuropsychology.
The British Psychological Division of Counselling Psychology are also currently offering training to its members in order to ensure that they can apply to be registered Neuropsychologists also.

===United States===
In order to become a clinical neuropsychologist in the US and be compliant with Houston Conference Guidelines, the completion of a 4-year undergraduate degree in psychology and a 4 to 5-year doctoral degree (PsyD or PhD) must be completed. After the completion of the doctoral coursework, training and dissertation, students must complete a 1-year internship, followed by an additional 2 years of supervised residency. The doctoral degree, internship and residency must all be undertaken at American Psychological Association approved institutions.
After the completion of all training, students must apply to become licensed in their state to practice psychology. The American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, The American Board of Professional Neuropsychology, and The American Board of Pediatric Neuropsychology all award board certification to neuropsychologists that demonstrate competency in specific areas of neuropsychology, by reviewing the neuropsychologist&#x27;s training, experience, submitted case samples, and successfully completing both written and oral examinations. Although these requirements are standard according to Houston Conference Guidelines, even these guidelines have stated that the completion of all of these requirements is still aspirational, and other ways of achieving clinical neuropsychologist status are possible.

<text>Brenda Milner (&quot;née&quot; Langford; born 15 July 1918) is a British-Canadian neuropsychologist who has contributed extensively to the research literature on various topics in the field of clinical neuropsychology. Milner is a professor in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University and a professor of Psychology at the Montreal Neurological Institute. , she holds more than 25 honorary degrees and she continued to work in her nineties. Her work covers many aspects of neuropsychology including her lifelong interest in the involvement of the temporal lobes in episodic memory. She is sometimes referred to as one of the founders of neuropsychology and has been essential in its development. She received the Balzan Prize for Cognitive Neuroscience in 2009, and the Kavli Prize in Neuroscience, together with John O&#x27;Keefe, and Marcus E. Raichle, in 2014. She turned 100 in July 2018.

==Early life and education==
Brenda Langford was born on 15 July 1918, in Manchester, England. Her father Samuel Langford was a musical critic, journalist, and teacher, and her mother (née Leslie Doig) was one of his students. Though she was a daughter to two musically talented parents, she had no interest in music. She was tutored by her father in mathematics and the arts until the age of 8.&quot; She attended Withington Girls&#x27; School, which led her to attend Newnham College, Cambridge, to study mathematics, having received a scholarship in 1936. However, after realising she was not &quot;perceptive&quot; enough for mathematics, Milner changed her field of study to psychology. In 1939, Milner graduated with a B.A. degree in experimental psychology, which at that time was considered a moral science.

One of her supervisors in the Department of Experimental Psychology, Cambridge was Oliver Zangwill and to him she owed her first interest in human brain function, and the value of studying brain lesions.

After her graduation near the time of World War II Newnham College awarded her a Sarah Smithson Research Studentship, which allowed her to attend Newnham for the following two years. As a result of World War II, the work of the Cambridge Psychological Laboratory, under Bartlett&#x27;s leadership, was diverted almost overnight to applied research in the selection of aircrew. Milner&#x27;s position was to devise perceptual tasks for future use in selecting aircrew. More specifically, she was on a team interested in distinguishing fighter pilots from bomber pilots using aptitude tests. &quot;Later in the war, from 1941 to 1944, she worked in Malvern as an Experimental Officer for the Ministry of Supply, investigating different methods of display and control to be used by radar operators.&quot;

In 1941 Brenda met her husband, Peter Milner. Both Brenda and her husband were working on radar research. He was an electrical engineer who had also been recruited for the war effort. In 1944, they married and left for Canada where Peter had been invited to work with physicists on atomic research. They travelled to Boston on the ship the Queen Elizabeth together with &quot;war brides&quot; who were travelling to the United States to live with their husbands&#x27; families during the war. Upon arrival in Canada, she began teaching psychology at the University of Montreal, where she stayed for 7 years.

In 1949, Brenda Milner graduated with a M.A. in experimental psychology in Cambridge. In Montreal, she became a Ph.D. candidate in physiological psychology at McGill University, under the direction of Donald Olding Hebb. While working on her Ph.D., Milner and Hebb presented research on their patient P.B. who had undergone a medial temporal lobectomy and had subsequent memory impairment. This garnered the attention of Wilder Penfield. In 1950, Hebb gave Milner an opportunity to study with him at the Montreal Neurological Institute. Under the supervision of Penfield, she studied the behaviour of young adult epileptic patients treated with elective focal ablation of brain tissue to treat uncontrolled seizures. In 1952, Milner earned her Ph.D. in experimental psychology with a thesis on the cognitive effects of temporal lobe damage in man. Milner has been awarded a large number of honorary degrees including an honorary Sc.D from the University of Cambridge in 2000.

== Professional career ==
In 1954, Milner published an article in the McGill University Psychological Bulletin entitled &#x27;Intellectual Function of the Temporal Lobes&#x27;. In this publication, she presented data that showed that temporal lobe damage can cause emotional and intellectual changes in humans and lower primates. Her review of neuroscience studies conducted in animals discouraged many neurosurgeons from completing surgeries on humans that could negatively impact their lives. &quot;Milner&#x27;s early work on the temporal lobes was influenced by the results of ablation work with lower primates, and particularly by Mishkin and Pribram&#x27;s discovery of the role of the inferotemporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning.&quot;

Milner was a pioneer in the field of neuropsychology and in the study of memory and other cognitive functions in humankind. She was invited to Hartford to study Henry Molaison, formerly known as patient H.M., who became the most famous patient in cognitive neuroscience. He &quot;had undergone a bilateral temporal lobectomy that included removal of major portions of the hippocampus.&quot; She studied the effects of this damage to the medial temporal lobe on memory and systematically described the cognitive deficits exhibited by H.M.

In the early stages of her work with H.M., Milner wanted to completely understand his memory impairments. Milner showed that the medial temporal lobe amnestic syndrome is characterised by an inability to acquire new memories and an inability to recall established memories from a few years immediately before damage, while memories from the more remote past and other cognitive abilities, including language, perception and reasoning were intact. For example, Milner spent three days with H.M. as he learned a new perceptual-motor task in order to determine what type of learning and memory were intact in him. This task involved reproducing the drawing of a star by looking at it in a mirror. His performance improved over those three days. However, he subsequently retained absolutely no memory of any events that took place during those three days. This led Milner to speculate that there are different types of learning and memory, each dependent on a separate system of the brain . She was able to demonstrate two different memory systems - episodic memory and procedural memory.

Milner discovered from H.M. and other case studies that &quot;bilateral medial temporal-lobe resection in man results in a persistent impairment of recent memory whenever the removal is carried far enough posteriorly to damage portions of the anterior hippocampus and hippocampal gyrus.&quot; She showed that in patients with this syndrome the ability to learn certain motor skills remained normal. This finding introduced the concept of multiple memory systems within the brain and stimulated an enormous body of research. Milner stated in an interview with the &quot;McGill Journal of Medicine&quot;, &quot;To see that H.M. had learned the task perfectly but with absolutely no awareness that he had done it before was an amazing dissociation. If you want to know what was an exciting moment of my life, that was one.&quot;

She has made major contributions to the understanding of the role of the frontal lobes in memory processing, in the area of organizing information. &quot;Dr. Milner&#x27;s seminal research has provided many landmark discoveries in the study of human memory and the brain&#x27;s temporal lobes, which play a key role in emotional responses, hearing, memory and speech.&quot;

She demonstrated the critical role of the dorsolateral frontal cortex for the temporal organization of memory and her work showed that there is partial separability of the neural circuits subserving recognition memory from those mediating memory for temporal order. She described the inflexibility in problem solving that is now widely recognized as a common consequence of frontal-lobe injury. These refinements in the understanding of memory and exposition of the relevant brain regions revealed the anatomically diffuse nature of complex cognitive functions in the brain.

Milner helped describe the lateralization of function in the human brain and has shown how the neural substrate of language in the cerebral hemispheres can vary in left-handed, right-handed and ambidextrous individuals (see handedness). She used the Wada test to show that for any handedness, the left hemisphere is dominant for language in most people. These studies of the relationship between hand preference and speech lateralization led to an understanding of the effects of early unilateral brain lesions on the pattern of cerebral organization at maturity. Her studies were among the first to demonstrate convincingly that damage to the brain can lead to dramatic functional reorganization.

Using mostly prize money from her numerous awards, Milner donated 1 million dollars to the Montreal Neurological Institute in 2007, after establishing a foundation in her name.

==Recent research==

In more recent times, Milner has expanded her research to the study of brain activity in normal subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). These studies focus on the identification of brain regions associated with spatial memory and language, including the neural substrates of monolingual and bilingual speech processing. In another series of PET studies, she has sought to delineate further the role of the right hippocampal region in memory for the spatial location of objects.

Milner kept some involvement in teaching and researching past her 100th birthday. She is the Dorothy J. Killam Professor at the Montreal Neurological Institute, and a professor in the Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery at McGill University. One of Milner&#x27;s current collaborators is Denise Klein, an assistant professor in the Neurology/Cognitive Neuroscience unit at McGill. Their research on bilingualism entails investigating the difference in neural pathways used to acquire new and native languages.

In 2018, Milner celebrated her 100th birthday in Montreal with about 30 friends, including fellow researcher Denise Klein. Although she never expected to reach this age, Milner stated that she has &quot;every intention of continuing for many more birthdays.&quot; The Montreal Neurological Institute held a symposium in September 2018, celebrating her accomplishments. That same year, Milner participated in a video series, launched by the Montreal Neurological Institute, dedicated to promoting female scientists and researchers. During the interview, Milner spoke about her early life and gave an overview of her career.

==Awards and honours==
Milner has received numerous awards for her contributions to neuroscience and psychology including memberships in the Royal Society of London, the Royal Society of Canada and the National Academy of Sciences. In total, she has been awarded honorary degrees from more than 20 different universities across Canada, Europe, and the United States.

Early on, Milner was awarded a Sarah Smithson Research Studentship by Newnham College, Cambridge after her graduation, which allowed her to continue her work at Newnham College. In 1984 Milner was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 2004. In 1987, she was awarded the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience. She was also awarded the National Academy of Sciences Award in the Neurosciences in 2004 for her seminal investigations of the role of the temporal lobes and other brain regions in learning, memory, and language. In 1985, she was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec and was promoted to Grand Officer in 2009. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007. She was awarded the Balzan Prize for her contributions to Cognitive Neurosciences in a ceremony held in the Swiss Parliament in December 2009.

Milner was awarded the Kavli Prize in Neuroscience in 2014. Other awards and recognition include: Election to the National Academy of Sciences (1976), the Metlife Foundation Award for Medical Research in Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease (1996), election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2005), the Dan David Prize (2014), the from the (2014), induction into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame (2012), recipient of a medal of honour from the National Assembly of Quebec (2018), Pearl Meister Greengard Prize (2011), the Norman A.

<text>The Mbuti people, or Bambuti, are one of several indigenous pygmy groups in the Congo region of Africa. Their languages are Central Sudanic languages and Bantu languages.

==Subgroups==
Bambuti are pygmy hunter-gatherers, and are one of the oldest indigenous people of the Congo region of Africa. The Bambuti are composed of bands which are relatively small in size, ranging from 15 to 60 people. The Bambuti population totals about 30,000 to 40,000 people. Many Batwa in various parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) also call themselves Bambuti.

There are three distinct subgroups:

* The Sua (also Kango, or Mbuti), who speak a dialect (or perhaps two) of the language of a neighboring Bantu people, Bila. They are located centrally and are eponymous of the larger group.
* The Efé, who speak the language of the neighboring Central Sudanic Lese.
* The Asua, speakers of the Mangbetu (Central Sudanic) Asua language.

== Environment ==

The Mbuti population live in the Ituri, a tropical rainforest covering about of the north/northeast portion of the DRC. In this area, there is a high amount of rainfall annually, ranging from . The dry season is in January, and then May through August. The forest is a moist, humid region strewn with rivers and lakes. Several ecological problems exist which affect the Bambuti. Tropical disease is prevalent in the forests and can spread quickly, killing not only humans, but plants, and animals, the major source of food, as well. One disease, carried by tsetse flies, is sleeping sickness, which limits the use of large mammals. Too much rainfall, as well as droughts, can greatly diminish the food supply.

==Culture==
=== Settlement, architecture and organization ===
The Bambuti live in villages that are categorized as bands. Each hut houses a family unit. At the start of the dry season, they leave the village to enter the forest and set up a series of camps. This way, the Bambuti are able to utilize more land area for maximum foraging. These villages are solitary and separated from other groups of people. Their houses are small, circular, and very temporary.

House construction begins with the tracing of the outline of the house into the ground. The walls of the structures are strong sticks that are placed in the ground, and at the top of the sticks, a vine is tied around them to keep them together. Large leaves and grass are used in the construction of the hut roofs.

=== Food and resources ===

The Bambuti are primarily hunter-gatherers. Their animal diet can include crabs, shellfish, ants, larvae, snails, wild pigs, antelopes, monkeys, fish, and honey. The vegetable component of their diet includes wild yams, berries, fruits, roots, leaves, and kola nuts.

The Bambuti have an elaborate system of food allowances and restrictions; foods that are restricted are called kweri. Food sources yielded by the forest are non-&quot;kweri&quot; animals for meat consumption, root plants, palm trees, and bananas; and in some seasons, wild honey. Yams, legumes, beans, peanuts, hibiscus, amaranth, and gourds are consumed. The Bambuti use large nets, traps, and bows and arrows to hunt game. Women and children sometimes assist in the hunt by driving the prey into the nets. Both sexes gather and forage. Each band has its own hunting ground, although boundaries are hard to maintain. The Mbuti call the forest &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;father&quot; as the mood seizes them, because, like their parents, the forest gives them food, shelter, and clothing, which are readily made from abundant forest materials.

The Bantu villagers produce many items that the hunter-gatherers trade some of their products for. They often obtain iron goods, pots, wooden goods, and basketry, in exchange for meat, animal hides, and other forest goods. Bushmeat is a particularly frequently traded item. They will also trade to obtain agricultural products from the villagers through barter.

Hunting is usually done in groups, with men, women, and children all aiding in the process. Women and children are not involved if the hunting involves the use of a bow and arrow, but if nets are used, it is common for everyone to participate. In some instances, women may hunt using a net more often than men. The women and the children herd the animals to the net, while the men guard the net. Everyone engages in foraging, and women and men both take care of the children. Women are in charge of cooking, cleaning and repairing the hut, and obtaining water. The kin-based units work together to provide food and care for the young. It is easier for men to lift the women into the trees for honey.

====Food restrictions====
According to a study published in 1987, based on fieldwork and data gathered between 1974 and 1985, the Mbuti restrict some 40% of the over 500 species of plants and animals they gather and hunt, including some 85% of the animals. The &quot;kweri&quot; animals are thought to cause disease and disorder, especially to young children; restrictions are gradually relaxed as one ages.

=== Kinship and descent system ===
The Bambuti tend to follow a patrilineal descent system, and their residences after marriage are patrilocal. However, the system is rather loose. The only type of group seen amongst the Bambuti is the nuclear family. Kinship also provides allies for each group of people.

=== Marriage customs ===
Sister exchange is the common form of marriage. Based on reciprocal exchange, men from other bands exchange sisters or other females to whom they have ties. In Bambuti society, bride wealth is not customary. There is no formal marriage ceremony: a couple are considered officially married when the groom presents his bride&#x27;s parents with an antelope he alone has hunted and killed. Polygamy does occur, but at different rates depending on the group, and it is not very common. The sexual intercourse of married couples is regarded as an act entirely different from that of unmarried partners, for only in marriage may children be conceived.

=== Political structure ===
Bambuti societies have no ruling group or lineage, no overlying political organization, and little social structure. The Bambuti are an egalitarian society in which the band is the highest form of social organization. Leadership may be displayed for example on hunting treks. Men become leaders because they are good hunters. Owing to their superior hunting ability, leaders eat more meat and fat and fewer carbohydrates than other men. Men and women basically have equal power. Issues are discussed and decisions are made by consensus at fire camps; men and women engage in the conversations equivalently. If there is a disagreement, misdemeanor, or offense, then the offender may be banished, beaten, or scorned. In more recent times the practice is to remove the offender from the forest and have them work for private landowners for little to no pay.

===Mythology===

Everything in the Bambuti life is centered on the forest. They consider the forest to be their great protector and provider and believe that it is a sacred place. They sometimes call the forest &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;father&quot;. An important ritual that impacts the Bambuti&#x27;s life is referred to as &quot;molimo&quot;. After events such as death of an important person in the tribe, &quot;molimo&quot; is noisily celebrated to wake the forest, in the belief that if bad things are happening to its children, it must be asleep. As with many Bambuti rituals, the time it takes to complete a molimo is not rigidly set; instead, it is determined by the mood of the group. Food is collected from each hut to feed the molimo, and in the evening the ritual is accompanied by the men dancing and singing around the fire. Women and children must remain in their huts with the doors closed. These practices were studied thoroughly by British anthropologist Colin Turnbull, known primarily for his work with the tribe.

&quot;Molimo&quot; is also the name of a trumpet the men play during the ritual. Traditionally, it was made of wood or sometimes bamboo, but Turnbull also reported the use of metal drainpipes. The sound produced by a molimo is considered more important than the material it is made out of. When not in use, the trumpet is stored in the trees of the forest. During a celebration, the trumpet is retrieved by the youth of the village and carried back to the fire.

== Contemporary situation ==
The way of life of the Bambuti is threatened for various reasons. Their territory in the DRC has no legal protections, and the boundaries that each band claims are not formally established. Bambuti are no longer allowed to hunt large game. Due to deforestation, gold mining, and modern influences from plantations, agriculturalists, and efforts to conserve the forests, their food supply is threatened. There is also significant civil unrest in the country.

The Bambuti have also been targets of a genocide campaign known as &quot;Effacer le tableau&quot;.

==Genetics==

Y-chromosomal haplogroup E-M200 has been found in 25% (3/12) of a small sample of Mbuti from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Haplogroup B-P7 has been observed most frequently in samples of some populations of pygmies 21% (10/47) Mbuti from Democratic Republic of the Congo.

==Languages==
There are three distinct languages spoken by the Mbuti:

*Kango, a Bantu Zone D language related to Bila
*Efe, a Mangbutu language related to Lese
*Asua language, a Mangbetu language

Efe and Asua are Central Sudanic languages, while Kango is a Niger–Congo language.

<doc id="605581" wikidata="Q43103" url="?curid=605581" title="European Americans">
<text>European Americans are Americans of European ancestry. This term includes both people who descend from the first European settlers in the area of the present-day United States and people who descend from more recent European arrivals. Since the 17th century, European Americans have been the largest panethnic group in what is now the United States.

The Spaniards were the first Europeans to establish a continuous presence in what is now the contiguous United States, with Martín de Argüelles ( 1566) in St. Augustine, then a part of Spanish Florida, and the Russians were the first Europeans to settle in Alaska, establishing Russian America. The first English child born in the Americas was Virginia Dare, born August 18, 1587. She was born in Roanoke Colony, located in present-day North Carolina, which was the first attempt, made during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, to establish a permanent English settlement in North America.

In the 2020 United States census, English Americans (46.6 million), German Americans (45 million), Irish Americans (38.6 million), Italian Americans (16.8 million) and Polish Americans (8.6 million) were the five largest self-reported European ancestry groups in the United States.

The 2020 census was the first census to allow data collection on subtypes of Europeans. During previous surveys, the number of people with British ancestry was considered to be significantly under-counted, as many people in that demographic tended to identify themselves simply as Americans (20,151,829 or 7.2%). A 2015 genetic study of 148,789 European Americans concluded that British ancestry was the most common European ancestry among white Americans, with this component ranging between 20% and 55% of the total population in all 50 states. The same applies to Americans of Spanish ancestry, as many people in that demographic tend to identify themselves as Hispanic and Latino Americans (58,846,134 or 16.6%), even though they carry a mean of 65.1% European genetic ancestry, mainly from Spain.

An increasing number of people ignored the ancestry question or chose no specific ancestral group such as &quot;American or United States&quot;. In the 2000 census this represented over 56.1 million or 19.9% of the United States population, an increase from 26.2 million (10.5%) in 1990 and 38.2 million (16.9%) in 1980 and are specified as &quot;unclassified&quot; and &quot;not reported&quot;.

== Terminology ==

=== Use ===
In 1995, as part of a review of the Office of Management and Budget&#x27;s Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 (Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting), a survey was conducted of census recipients to determine their preferred terminology for the racial/ethnic groups defined in the Directive. For the &quot;White&quot; group, &quot;European American&quot; came a distant third, preferred by only 2.35% of panel interviewees, as opposed to &quot;White&quot;, which was preferred by 61.66%.

The term is sometimes used interchangeably with Caucasian American, White American, and Anglo-American in the United States.

=== Origin ===
In contexts such as medical research, terms such as &quot;white&quot; and &quot;European&quot; have been criticized for vagueness and blurring important distinctions between different groups that happen to fit within the label. Margo Adair suggests that viewing Americans of European descent as a single group contributes to the &quot;wonder-breading&quot; of the United States, eradicating the cultural heritage of individual European ethnicities.

=== Subgroups ===

There are several subgroupings of European Americans. While these categories may be approximately defined, often due to the imprecise or cultural regionalization of Europe, the subgroups are nevertheless used widely in cultural or ethnic identification. This is particularly the case in diasporic populations, as with European people in the United States generally. In alphabetical order, some of the subgroups are:
* Northwestern European Americans, including Austrian Americans, Belgian Americans, British Americans (Cornish Americans, English Americans, Manx Americans, Scotch-Irish Americans, Scottish Americans, Welsh Americans), Dutch Americans, French Americans (Breton Americans), German Americans, Irish Americans, Luxembourger Americans, Nordic and Scandinavian Americans (Danish Americans, Finnish Americans, Icelandic Americans, Norwegian Americans, Swedish Americans), and Swiss Americans, or &quot;Old Immigrants&quot; (the first waves of which arrived pre-1881)
* Eastern European Americans, including Belarusian Americans, Czech Americans, Estonian Americans, Hungarian Americans, Latvian Americans, Lithuanian Americans, Polish Americans, Russian Americans, Slovak Americans, and Ukrainian Americans, or &quot;New Immigrants&quot; (the first large waves of which arrived 1881–1965)
* Southern European Americans, including Albanian Americans, Bosnian Americans, Bulgarian Americans, Croatian Americans, Cypriot Americans, Greek Americans, Italian Americans, Maltese Americans, Macedonian Americans, Moldovan Americans, Montenegrin Americans, Portuguese Americans, Romanian Americans, Serbian Americans, Slovenian Americans, and Spanish Americans (Basque Americans, Catalan Americans, Galician Americans), also &quot;New Immigrants&quot; or &quot;New Immigrants&quot;(the first large waves of which arrived 1881–1965)

== History ==

Before the arrival of Europeans, Native Americans predominantly inhabited the United States. The earliest Europeans to colonize North America were the Spaniards. The first Spanish colonization was in 1565 at St. Augustine, Florida. One of the most significant Spanish explorers was Hernando De Soto, a conquistador who accompanied Francisco Pizzaro during his conquest of the Inca Empire.

Leaving Havana, Cuba, in 1539, De Soto&#x27;s expedition landed in Florida. It explored the southeastern area of the United States. They reached as far as the Mississippi River in search of riches and fortune. Another Spaniard who explored the United States, Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, set out from New Spain in 1540 in search of the mythical Seven Cities of Gold. Coronado&#x27;s expedition traveled to Kansas and the Grand Canyon but failed to discover gold or treasure. However, Coronado left a gift of horses to the Plains Indians. Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazano and Frenchman Jacques Cartier are other Europeans who explored the United States. The Spaniards viewed the French as threatening their trade route along the Gulf Stream.

Since 1607, some 57 million immigrants from other lands have come to the United States. Approximately 10 million passed through on their way to some other place or returned to their homelands, leaving a net gain of 47 million people.

===Shifts in European migration===
Before 1881, the vast majority of immigrants, almost 86% of the total, arrived from Northwestern Europe, principally Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia, known as &quot;Old Immigration&quot;. Between 1881 and 1893, the pattern shifted in the sources of U.S. &quot;New Immigration.&quot; Between 1894 and 1914, immigrants from Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe accounted for 69% of the total. Prior to 1960, the overwhelming majority came from Europe or of European descent from Canada. Immigration from Europe as a proportion of new arrivals has declined since the mid-20th century, with 75.0% of the total foreign-born population born in Europe compared to 12.1% recorded in the 2010 census.

=== Immigration since 1820 ===


== Culture ==
As the largest component of the American population, the overall American culture deeply reflects the European-influenced culture that predates the United States of America as an independent state. Much of American culture shows influences from the diverse nations of the United Kingdom and Ireland, such as the English, Irish, Cornish, Manx, Scotch-Irish, Scottish and Welsh. Colonial ties to the United Kingdom spread the English language, legal system and other cultural attributes.

Scholar David Hackett Fischer asserts in &quot;Albion&#x27;s Seed: Four British Folkways in America&quot; that the folkways of four groups of people who moved from distinct regions of the United Kingdom to the United States persisted and provide a substantial cultural basis for much of the modern United States. Fischer explains &quot;the origins and stability of a social system which for two centuries has remained stubbornly democratic in its politics, capitalist in its economy, libertarian in its laws and individualist in its society and pluralistic in its culture.&quot;

Much of the European-American cultural lineage can be traced back to Western and Northern Europe, which is institutionalized in the government, traditions, and civic education in the United States.
Since most later European Americans have assimilated into American culture, many Americans of European ancestry now generally express their personal ethnic ties sporadically and symbolically and do not consider their specific ethnic origins to be essential to their identity; however, European American ethnic expression has been revived since the 1960s. Some European Americans such as Italians, Greeks, Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, Irish, and others have maintained high levels of ethnic identity. In the 1960s, the melting pot ideal to some extent gave way to increased interest in cultural pluralism, strengthening affirmations of ethnic identity among various American ethnic groups, European as well as others.

=== Law ===
The American legal system also has its roots in French philosophy with the separation of powers and the federal system along with English law in common law.

=== Cuisine ===

* Apple pie – New England was the first region to experience large-scale English colonization in the early 17th century, beginning in 1620, and it was dominated by East Anglian Calvinists, better known as the Puritans. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders and was the origin of dishes seen today as quintessentially &quot;American&quot;, such as apple pie and the oven-roasted Thanksgiving turkey, a bird that although not found in Europe has become linked in tradition and symbolism to the early European immigrants. &quot;As American as apple pie&quot; is a well-known phrase used to suggest that something is all-American.
* Hamburger – Although the origins of the hamburger, including the country in which it was first served, are subjects of debate, the hamburger first became widely marketed in the United States and has been internationally known for decades as a symbol of American fast food.
* Buffalo wings – Invented in 1964 at Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York by Italian-American Teressa Bellissimo. Now popular all over the country, it has become a symbol of American cuisine.
* Hot dog – Hot dogs were brought to New York by German immigrants.
* Pizza – Italian immigrants from Naples brought pizza to the United States.
* Fried chicken – Scottish immigrants brought fried chicken to the Southern United States. Enslaved African Americans began cooking fried chicken based on the recipes from white Scottish slaveholders.

=== Thanksgiving ===
* Thanksgiving – In the United States, it has become a national secular holiday (official since 1863) with religious origins. The first Thanksgiving was celebrated by British settlers to give thanks to God and the Native Americans for helping the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony survive the brutal winter. The modern Thanksgiving holiday traces its origins from a 1621 celebration at the Plymouth Plantation, where the Plymouth settlers held a harvest feast with the Native Americans after a successful growing season. William Bradford is credited as the first to proclaim the American cultural event which is generally referred to as the &quot;First Thanksgiving&quot;.

=== Sports ===

* Baseball – The earliest recorded game of base-ball involved the family of the Prince of Wales, played indoors in London in November 1748. The Prince is reported as playing &quot;Bass-Ball&quot; again in September 1749 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, against Lord Middlesex. English lawyer William Bray recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey; Bray&#x27;s diary was verified as authentic in September 2008. This early form of the game was apparently brought to North America by English immigrants. The first appearance of the term that exists in print was in &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot; in 1744, where it is called Base-Ball.
* American football – can be traced to modified early versions of rugby football played in England and Canadian football mixed with and ultimately changed by American innovations which led over time to the finished version of the game from 1876 to now. The basic set of rules were first developed in American universities in the mid-19th century.
* Golf - Golf originated from Scotland in the 15th century, the first course in Scotland being St Andrews. The first golf course in America was founded by a Scot John Reid in 1888, and was named after the first Scottish golf club Saint Andrew&#x27;s Golf Club located in Yonkers, New York, from here golf soared as a national hobby, and by the turn of the 20th Century there was more than 1,000 golf courses in North America.

=== Music ===
Another area of cultural influence are American Patriotic songs:
* The Star-Spangled Banner – takes its melody from the 18th-century English song &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot; written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men&#x27;s social club in London and lyrics written by American Francis Scott Key. This became a well-known and recognized patriotic song throughout the United States, which was officially designated as the American national anthem in 1931.
Before 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom.

* Amazing Grace – written by British poet and clergyman John Newton. Popular among African Americans, it became an icon in American culture and has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns.
* Hail, Columbia – initial presidential inauguration song up until early 20th century. Now used for the Vice President.
* Battle Hymn of the Republic – Patriotic song sung during the civil war time between 1861 and 1865.

== Admixture in non-Latino whites ==

Some European Americans have varying amounts of Native American and Native African ancestry. From the 23andMe database, about 5 to at least 13 percent of self-identified European American Southerners have greater than 1 percent native African ancestry. Southern states with the highest African American populations tended to have the highest percentages of hidden African ancestry. European Americans on average are: &quot;98.6 percent Native European, 0.19 percent Native African and 0.18 percent Native American.&quot; Inferred British/Irish ancestry is found in European Americans from all states at mean proportions of
above 20%, and represents a majority of ancestry, above 50% mean proportion, in states such
as Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Scandinavian
ancestry in European Americans is highly localized; most states show only trace mean
proportions of Scandinavian ancestry, while it comprises a significant proportion, upwards of
10%, of ancestry in European Americans from Minnesota and the Dakotas.

<doc id="605582" wikidata="Q549498" url="?curid=605582" title="GUM (department store)">
<text>GUM () is a shopping center in Moscow, Russia. It was also the main department store in many cities of the former Soviet Union; similarly named stores operated in some Soviet republics and in post-Soviet states.

The most famous GUM is the large store facing Red Square in the Kitai-gorod area – itself traditionally a mall of Moscow. Originally, and today again, the building functions as a shopping mall. During most of the Soviet period it was essentially a department store as there was one vendor: the Soviet State. Before the 1920s the location was known as the Upper Trading Rows ().

As of 2021, GUM carries over 100 different brands, and has cafes and restaurants inside the mall.

==Moscow GUM==

===Design and structure===

With the façade extending for along the eastern side of Red Square, the Upper Trading Rows were built between 1890 and 1893 by Alexander Pomerantsev (responsible for architecture) and Vladimir Shukhov (responsible for engineering). The trapezoidal building features a combination of elements of Russian medieval architecture and a steel framework and glass roof, a similar style to the great 19th-century railway stations of London. William Craft Brumfield described the GUM building as &quot;a tribute both to Shukhov&#x27;s design and to the technical proficiency of Russian architecture toward the end of the 19th century&quot;.

The glass-roofed design made the building unique at the time of construction. The roof, the diameter of which is , looks light, but it is a firm construction made of more than 50,000 metal pods (about ), capable of supporting snowfall accumulation. Illumination is provided by huge arched skylights of iron and glass, each weighing some and containing in excess of 20,000 panes of glass. The facade is divided into several horizontal tiers, lined with red Finnish granite, Tarusa marble, and limestone. Each arcade is on three levels, linked by walkways of reinforced concrete.

===History===

Catherine II of Russia commissioned Giacomo Quarenghi, a Neoclassical architect from Italy, to design a huge trade area along the east side of Red Square. However, that building was lost to the 1812 Fire of Moscow and replaced by trading rows designed by Joseph Bove. In turn, the current structure opened in 1894, replacing Bove&#x27;s.

By the time of the Russian Revolution of 1917, the building contained some 1,200 stores. After the Revolution, GUM was nationalized. During the NEP period (1921–28), however, GUM as a State Department Store operated as a model retail enterprise for consumers throughout Russia regardless of class, gender, and ethnicity. GUM&#x27;s stores were used to further Bolshevik goals of rebuilding private enterprise along socialist lines and &quot;democratizing consumption for workers and peasants nationwide&quot;. In the end, GUM&#x27;s efforts to build communism through consumerism were unsuccessful and arguably &quot;only succeeded in alienating consumers from state stores and instituting a culture of complaint and entitlement&quot;.

GUM continued to be used as a department store until Joseph Stalin converted it into office space in 1928 for the committee in charge of his first Five Year Plan. After the suicide of Stalin&#x27;s wife Nadezhda in 1932, the GUM was used briefly to display her body.

After reopening as a department store in 1953, GUM became one of the few stores in the Soviet Union that did not have shortages of consumer goods, and the queues of shoppers were long, often extending entirely across Red Square.

Several times during the 1960s and 1970s, the Second Secretary of the Communist Party Mikhail Suslov, who hated having a department store facing Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum, tried to convert GUM into an exhibition hall and museum showcasing the achievements of the Soviet Union and Communism, without the knowledge of General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. Each time, however, Brezhnev was tipped off and put a stop to such plans.

At the end of the Soviet era, GUM was partially, then fully, privatized, and it had a number of owners before it ended up being owned by the supermarket company Perekrestok. In May 2005, a 50.25% interest was sold to Bosco di Ciliegi, a Russian luxury goods distributor and boutique operator. As a private shopping mall, it was renamed in such a fashion that it could maintain its old acronym. The first word &quot;gosudarstvennyj&quot; (&#x27;state&#x27;) has been replaced with &quot;glavnyj&quot; (&#x27;main&#x27;), so that GUM is now an abbreviation for &quot;Main Universal Store&quot;.

<doc id="605584" wikidata="Q1239072" url="?curid=605584" title="Don Cornelius">
<text>Donald Cortez Cornelius (September 27, 1936 – February 1, 2012) was an American television show host and producer widely known as the creator of the nationally syndicated dance and music show &quot;Soul Train&quot;, which he hosted from 1970 until 1993. Cornelius sold the show to MadVision Entertainment in 2008. On November 3, 2023, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with the Ahmet Ertegun Award.

==Early life and career==
Cornelius was born on Chicago&#x27;s South Side on September 27, 1936, and raised in the Bronzeville neighborhood. After graduating from DuSable High School in 1954, he joined the United States Marine Corps and served for 18 months during the Korean War. He worked at various jobs following his stint in the military, including selling tires, automobiles, and insurance, and as an officer with the Chicago Police Department. He quit his day job to take a three-month broadcasting course in 1966, despite being married with two sons and having only $400 in his bank account. In 1966, he landed a job as an announcer, news reporter and disc jockey on Chicago radio station WVON.

Cornelius joined Chicago television station WCIU-TV in 1967 and hosted a news program called &quot;A Black&#x27;s View of the News&quot;. In 1970, he launched &quot;Soul Train&quot; on WCIU-TV as a daily local show. The program entered national syndication and moved to Los Angeles the following year. Eddie Kendricks, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Bobby Hutton and Honey Cone were featured on the national debut episode.

Originally a journalist and inspired by the civil rights movement, Cornelius recognized that in the late 1960s there were very few television venues in the United States for soul music (at the time, only one series, the public television show &quot;Soul!&quot;, was focused on the genre). He introduced many African-American musicians to a larger audience as a result of their appearances on &quot;Soul Train&quot;, a program that was both influential among African-Americans and popular with a wider audience. 

As writer, producer, and host of &quot;Soul Train&quot;, Cornelius was instrumental in offering wider exposure to black musicians such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, and Michael Jackson, as well as creating opportunities for talented dancers, setting a precedent for popular television dance programs. Cornelius said, &quot;We had a show that kids gravitated to,&quot; and Spike Lee described the program as an &quot;urban music time capsule&quot;.

With the creation of &quot;Soul Train&quot;, Cornelius was at the helm of a program that showed African Americans in a new light, creating a Black is Beautiful campaign. Prior to &quot;Soul Train&quot;, African Americans were only occasionally performing on TV, mostly as guests on white-centered programs. &quot;Soul Train&quot; showcased African American culture, and brought African American musicians and dancers to television. The show&#x27;s appeal to white audiences steadily grew and eventually earned a huge following.

Besides his smooth and deep voice and his afro, which slowly shrank over the years as hairstyle tastes changed, Cornelius was best known for the catchphrase that he used to close the show: &quot;and you can bet your last money, it&#x27;s all gonna be a stone gas, honey! I&#x27;m Don Cornelius, and as always in parting, we wish you love, peace and soul!&quot; After Cornelius&#x27;s departure, it was shortened to &quot;and as always, we wish you love, peace and soul!&quot; and it was used through the most recent new episodes in 2006. Another introductory phrase which he often used was: &quot;We got another sound comin&#x27; out of Philly that&#x27;s a sure &#x27;nough dilly&quot;.

He had a small number of film roles, such as record producer Moe Fuzz in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Tapeheads&quot; and a fictional version of himself in 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Bruno&quot;, a mockumentary about fictional singer Bruno Radolini, portrayed by Bruce Willis. In this doc Cornelius appears as the host of the local Detroit funk-gospel based show &quot;Bless My Soul&quot;, that presents Radolini&#x27;s return to the stage with a duet together with The Temptations.

Cornelius last appeared on the episode of the TV series &quot;Unsung&quot; featuring Full Force, which was aired two days before his death.

==Controversy==
===Arrest===
In October 2008, Cornelius was arrested at his Los Angeles home on Mulholland Drive on a felony domestic violence charge. He was released on bail. Cornelius appeared in court in November 2008, and was charged with spousal abuse and dissuading a witness from filing a police report. Cornelius appeared in court again in December 2008, and pleaded not guilty to spousal abuse. 

He was banned from going near his estranged wife, Russian model Victoria Avila-Cornelius (Viktoria Chapman), who had obtained two restraining orders against him. In March 2009, he changed his plea to no contest and was placed on 36 months of probation.

===Sexual assault allegation===
In the 2022 A&amp;E documentary miniseries &quot;Secrets of Playboy&quot;, Cornelius was accused of sexually assaulting two &quot;Playboy&quot; bunnies in the 1970s. The women were alleged to have been brought to Cornelius&#x27;s house for a three-day period where they were locked in separate rooms, bound, drugged and sexually assaulted. Cornelius&#x27;s son, Tony, released a statement calling the allegation an &quot;unbelievable story without real proof&quot;.

==Death==
At around 4 a.m. PST on February 1, 2012, police were called to Cornelius&#x27;s home in Los Angeles after reports of a shooting. He was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at the age of 75. 

An autopsy found that Cornelius had been suffering from seizures during the last 15 years of his life, a complication of a 21-hour brain operation he underwent in 1982 to correct a congenital deformity in his cerebral arteries. He admitted that he was never quite the same after that surgery, and it was a factor in his decision to retire from hosting &quot;Soul Train&quot; in 1993. Cornelius&#x27;s health took a further, sharp decline in the last six months of his life. Former &quot;Soul Train&quot; host Shemar Moore suggested that he may have also been in the early stages of dementia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease by this point. On the night of his suicide, Cornelius told his son in a phone call, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how much longer I can take this&quot;.

<doc id="605587" wikidata="Q391198" url="?curid=605587" title="Laughing dove">
<text>The laughing dove (Spilopelia senegalensis) is a small pigeon that is a resident breeder in Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and Western Australia where it has established itself in the wild after being released from Perth Zoo in 1898. This small long-tailed dove is found in dry scrub and semi-desert habitats where pairs can often be seen feeding on the ground. It is closely related to the spotted dove (&quot;Spilopelia chinensis&quot;) which is distinguished by a white and black chequered necklace. Other names include laughing turtle dove, palm dove and Senegal dove while in Asia the name little brown dove is often used.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the laughing dove in his six volume &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;La tourterelle à gorge tachetée du Sénégal&quot; and the Latin &quot;Tutur gutture maculato senegalensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the laughing dove which he placed with all the other pigeons in the genus &quot;Columba&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Columba senegalensis&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work.

For many years the laughing dove was placed in the genus &quot;Streptopelia&quot;. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2001 found this genus was paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Columba&quot;. To create monophyletic genera the laughing dove as well as the closely related spotted dove were moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Spilopelia&quot; that had been introduced by the Swedish zoologist Carl Sundevall in 1873.

Five populations with small plumage and size differences have been given the status of subspecies:
* &quot;S. s. phoenicophila&quot; (Hartert, 1916) – Morocco to northwest Libya
* &quot;S. s. aegyptiaca&quot; (Latham, 1790) – Nile Valley (Egypt)
* &quot;S. s. senegalensis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – southern laughing dove, west Arabia, Socotra Island, Africa south of the Sahara
* &quot;S. s. cambayensis&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – east Arabia and east Iran to Pakistan, India and Bangladesh
* &quot;S. s. ermanni&quot; (Bonaparte, 1856) – Kazakhstan, north Afghanistan, west China

Several other subspecies have been described but are not now generally recognised. These include &quot;S. s. sokotrae&quot; on Socotra Island, &quot;S. s. dakhlae&quot; in the Dakhla Oasis, Egypt and &quot;S. s. thome&quot; on São Tomé Island.

==Description==
The laughing dove is a long-tailed, slim pigeon, typically in length. It is pinkish brown on the underside with a lilac tinged head and neck. The head and underparts are pinkish, shading to buff on the lower abdomen. A chequered rufous and grey patch is found on the sides of the neck of adults and is made up of split feathers. The upper parts are brownish with a bluish-grey band along the wing. The back is uniform and dull brown in the South Asian population. The African populations &quot;S. s. senegalensis&quot; and &quot;S. s. phoenicophila&quot; have a bluish grey rump and upper tail coverts but differ in the shades of the neck and wing feathers while &quot;S. s. aegyptiaca&quot; is larger and the head and nape are vinous and upper wing coverts are rufous. The tail is graduated and the outer feathers are tipped in white. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Young birds lack the chequered neck markings. The legs are red. The populations vary slightly in plumage with those from more arid zones being paler. Abnormal leucistic plumages have been noted.

The chuckling call is a low rolling &quot;croo-doo-doo-doo-doo&quot; with a rising and falling amplitude.

==Distribution and habitat==

It is a common and widespread species in scrub, dry farmland, and in areas of human habitation, often becoming very tame. Its range includes much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. It is also found in Cyprus, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, the UAE, and Turkey (these populations may be derived from human introductions). They are mostly sedentary but some populations may make movements. Birds ringed in Gujarat have been recovered 200 km north in Pakistan and exhausted birds have been recorded landing on ships in the Arabian Sea. The species (thought to belong to the nominate population) was introduced to Perth in 1889 and has become established around Western Australia. Birds that land on ships may be introduced to new regions.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The species is usually seen in pairs or small parties and only rarely in larger groups. Larger groups are formed especially when drinking at waterholes in arid regions. Small numbers assemble on trees near waterholes before flying to the water&#x27;s edge where they are able to suck up water like other members of the pigeon family. Laughing doves eat the fallen seeds, mainly of grasses, other vegetable matter and small ground insects such as termites and beetles. They are fairly terrestrial, foraging on the ground in grasslands and cultivation. Their flight is quick and direct with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings characteristic of pigeons in general. 

The male in courtship display follows the female with head bobbing displays while cooing. The male pecks its folded wings in &quot;displacement-preening&quot; to solicit copulation from the female. A female accepts by crouching and begging for food. The male may indulge in courtship feeding before mounting and copulating. Pairs may preen each other. Males may also launch into the air with wing clapping above their backs and then glide down in a gentle arc when displaying. The species has a spread out breeding season in Africa. Almost year-round in Malawi and Turkey; and mainly May to November in Zimbabwe, February to June in Egypt and Tunisia. In Australia the main breeding season is September to November. The nest is a very flimsy platform of twigs built in a low bush and sometimes in crevices or under the eaves of houses. Both parents build the nest with males bringing the twigs which are then placed by the female. Two eggs are laid within an interval of a day between them and both parents take part in building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. Males spend more time incubating the nest during the day. The eggs are incubated after the second egg is laid and the eggs hatch after about 13 to 15 days. Nesting adults may feign injury to distract and draw predators away from the nest. Multiple broods may be raised by the same pair in the same nest. Seven broods by the same pair have been noted in Turkey. Initially the altricial hatchlings are fed with regurgitated crop-milk, a secretion from the lining of the crop of parent birds. The young fledge and leave the nest after about 14 to 16 days. The Jacobin cuckoo sometimes lays its egg in the nests of the laughing dove in Africa.

Feral populations in Australia are sometimes infected by a virus that causes symptoms similar to that produced in parrots by psittacine beak and feather disease. Several ectoparasitic bird lice have been found on the species and include those in the genera &quot;Coloceras&quot;, &quot;Columbicola&quot;, &quot;Bonomiella&quot; and &quot;Hohorstiella&quot;. A blood parasite &quot;Trypanosoma hannae&quot; has been recorded in the species. Southern grey shrike have been observed preying on an adult laughing dove in northwestern India while the lizard buzzard is a predator of the species in Africa. South African birds sometimes show a beak deformity in which the upper mandible overgrowth occurs.

<text>Edward Biddle (1738 – 5 September 1779) was an American soldier, lawyer, and statesman from Pennsylvania. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1775 and a signatory to the Continental Association, which was drafted and adopted by that Congress.

On June 6, 1761, Edward married Elizabeth Ross, the sister of George Ross. After the war, he read law in the offices of her brother. By 1767, he had been admitted to the bar, and the couple moved to Reading where he began his practice. Although the couple had no children, they both came from large families. Betsy Ross who gained fame as the seamstress of the first American flag was the wife of her nephew. He was the uncle of Congressman Richard Biddle and financier Nicholas Biddle.

==Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly==
In 1767, Biddle began his career in the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly as a representative for Berks County. He served there until the colonial assembly went out of business during the Revolution. While a representative, in 1768, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. He was also a member of the rebel provincial congress and later the state General Assembly until 1778. He was a leader within that body of the Whig or radical group in the struggle to set Pennsylvania&#x27;s course in the revolution.

In 1774, Pennsylvania was divided about the looming revolution. The loyalists and the supporters of the Penn family in the Assembly were joined by the Quakers who opposed any war. As a result, in July, the Assembly sent a split delegation to the Continental Congress: Joseph Galloway, Charles Humphreys, and Samuel Rhoads were all moderates, while Biddle, Thomas Mifflin, John Morton, and George Ross were radicals. That first Continental Congress produced a statement or Declaration of Rights, as well as a plan of union and pleas to King George to resolve the issues that separated the colonies from Great Britain. They also produced a renewal of the Continental Association, the non-importation agreement adopted in the wake of the Stamp Act protests. Biddle was a member of the committee that drafted the Declaration of Rights and later oversaw the printing of the resolutions the Congress had passed.

Early in 1775, Governor John Penn called the Assembly into session, intent on having Pennsylvania send its own declarations to the crown. These would be based on the Galloway Plan that had been rejected by the Continental Congress, and would try to reconcile Pennsylvania with the British government. But the legislature mirrored the growing split within the colonies. The Whigs, led by Biddle, Ross and John Dickinson won the day. Biddle was elected speaker, replacing Galloway who had held the post the previous year. The actions of the Continental Congress were approved, and a more radical delegation was named to the next Congress.

Biddle died in Chatsworth, Baltimore County, Maryland on September 5, 1779. He is buried in St. Pauls Churchyard in Baltimore.

<text>A media filter is a type of filter that uses a bed of sand, peat, shredded tires, foam, crushed glass, geo-textile fabric, anthracite, crushed granite or other material to filter water for drinking, swimming pools, aquaculture, irrigation, stormwater management, oil and gas operations, and other applications.

Each layer of media is designed to filter out specific types and sizes of particles, allowing for more efficient and effective removal of contaminants.

== Design==
One design brings the water in the top of a container through a &quot;header&quot; which distributes the water evenly. The filter &quot;media&quot; start with fine sand on the top and then becomes gradually coarser sand in a number of layers followed by gravel on the bottom, in gradually larger sizes. The top sand physically removes particles from the water. The job of the subsequent layers is to support the finer layer above and provide efficient drainage.

As particles become trapped in the media, the differential pressure across the bed increases. Periodically, a backwash may be initiated to remove the solids trapped in the bed. During backwash, flow is directed in the opposite direction from normal flow. In multi-media filters, the layers in the media re-stratify due to density differences prior to resuming normal filtration. Multimedia filter can remove particles down to 10-25 microns. 

==Advantages and disadvantages==

=== Advantages of multimedia filters ===

# Multimedia filters use multiple layers of different filter media to achieve more effective and efficient filtration than single-media filters like sand filters.    
# They can remove a wider range of particle sizes and types than single-media filters, resulting in more efficient filtration and longer filter life.  
# They are effective at removing suspended solids, turbidity, and other contaminants from water.    
# They can be used for a wide range of flow rates and particle sizes. They can be easily backwashed to clean the filter media and restore filtration efficiency.    
# They require little to no electricity to operate.   

=== Disadvantages of multimedia filters ===

# Multimedia filters have a higher capital cost compared to single-media filters like sand filters.
# They have a larger footprint and require more space than single-media filters. 
# They may not be effective at removing some types of contaminants, such as dissolved organic compounds and bacteria.
# They may require pre-treatment to remove large particles or debris that could clog the filter media. 
# They can create waste material (backwash water) that needs to be treated or disposed of properly.   

==Uses==

=== Drinking water ===
Media filters are used in drinking water treatment, where multimedia filters are used as a primary or secondary filtration step to remove a wider range of particle sizes and types than sand filters, including organic matter and smaller particles.  

Municipal drinking water systems often use a rapid sand filter and/or a slow sand filter for purification. Silica sand is the most widely used medium in such filters. Anthracite coal, garnet sand, ilmenite, granular activated carbon, manganese green sand and crushed recycled glass are among the alternative filter media used.

=== Stormwater ===

Media filters are used to protect water quality in streams, rivers, and lakes. They can be effective at removing pollutants in stormwater such as suspended solids and phosphorus. Sand is the most common filter material. In other filters, sometimes called &quot;organic filters,&quot; wood chips or leaf mold may be used.

=== Sewage and wastewater ===
Media filters are also used for cleaning the effluent from septic tanks and primary settlement tanks. The materials commonly used are sand, peat and natural stone fibre.

=== Oil and gas industry ===
The oil and gas industry uses media filters for various purposes in both upstream and downstream operations. Nut shell filters are commonly used as a tertiary oil removal step for treatment of produced water. Sand filters are often used to remove fine solids following biological treatment and clarification of oil refinery wastewater. Multi-media filters are used for removing suspended solids from both produced water and refinery wastewater. The materials commonly used in multi-media filters are gravel, sand, garnet, and anthracite.

<text>The off-side rule describes syntax of a computer programming language that defines the bounds of a code block via indentation.

The term was coined by Peter Landin, possibly as a pun on the offside law in association football.

An off-side rule language is contrasted with a free-form language in which indentation has no syntactic meaning, and indentation is strictly a matter of style.

An off-side rule language is also described as having significant indentation.

== Definition ==

Peter Landin, in his 1966 article &quot;The Next 700 Programming Languages&quot;, defined the off-side rule thus: &quot;Any non-whitespace token to the left of the first such token on the previous line is taken to be the start of a new declaration.&quot;

== Example ==

The following is an example of indentation blocks in Python; a popular off-side rule language. 
In Python, the rule is taken to define the boundaries of statements rather than declarations.
def is_even(a: int) -&gt; bool:
 if a % 2 == 0:
 print(&#x27;Even!&#x27;)
 return True
 print(&#x27;Odd!&#x27;)
 return False
The body of the function starts on line 2 since it is indented one level (4 spaces) more than the previous line. The codice_1 clause body starts on line 3 since it is indented an additional level, and ends on line 4 since line 5 is indented a level less, a.k.a. outdented.

The colon (codice_2) at the end of a control statement line is Python syntax; not an aspect of the off-side rule. The rule can be realized without such colon syntax.

==Implementation==

The off-side rule can be implemented in the lexical analysis phase, as in Python, where increasing the indenting results in the lexer outputting an codice_3 token, and decreasing the indenting results in the lexer outputting a codice_4 token. These tokens correspond to the opening brace codice_5 and closing brace codice_6 in languages that use braces for blocks, and means that the phrase grammar does not depend on whether braces or indentation are used. This requires that the lexer hold state, namely the current indent level, and thus can detect changes in indentation when this changes, and thus the lexical grammar is not context-free: codice_3 and codice_4 depend on the contextual information of the prior indent level.

==Alternatives==
The primary alternative to delimiting blocks by indenting, popularized by broad use and influence of the language C, is to ignore whitespace characters and mark blocks explicitly with curly brackets (i.e., codice_5 and codice_6) or some other delimiter. While this allows for more formatting freedom – a developer might choose not to indent small pieces of code like the break and continue statements – sloppily indented code might lead the reader astray, such as the goto fail bug.

Lisp and other S-expression-based languages do not differentiate statements from expressions, and parentheses are enough to control the scoping of all statements within the language. As in curly bracket languages, whitespace is mostly ignored by the reader (i.e., the read function). Whitespace is used to separate tokens. The explicit structure of Lisp code allows automatic indenting, to form a visual cue for human readers.

Another alternative is for each block to begin and end with explicit keywords. For example, in ALGOL 60 and its descendant Pascal, blocks start with keyword codice_11 and end with keyword codice_12. In some languages (but not Pascal), this means that newlines &quot;are&quot; important (unlike in curly brace languages), but the indentation is not. In BASIC and Fortran, blocks begin with the block name (such as codice_13) and end with the block name prepended with codice_14 (e.g., codice_15). In Fortran, each and every block can also have its own unique block name, which adds another level of explicitness to lengthy code. ALGOL 68 and the Bourne shell (sh, and bash) are similar, but the end of the block is usually given by the name of the block written backward (e.g., codice_16 starts a switch statement and it spans until the matching codice_17; similarly conditionals codice_1...codice_19...[codice_20...[codice_21...]]codice_22 or &quot;for&quot; loops codice_23...codice_24...codice_25 in ALGOL68 or codice_23...codice_24...codice_28 in bash).

An interesting variant of this occurs in Modula-2, a Pascal-like language which does away with the difference between one and multiline blocks. This allows the block opener (codice_5 or codice_30) to be skipped for all but the function level block, requiring only a block terminating token (codice_6 or codice_14). It also fixes dangling else. Custom is for the codice_12 token to be placed on the same indent level as the rest of the block, giving a blockstructure that is very readable.

One advantage to the Fortran approach is that it improves readability of long, nested, or otherwise complex code. A group of outdents or closing brackets alone provides no contextual cues as to which blocks are being closed, necessitating backtracking, and closer scrutiny while debugging. Further, languages that allow a suffix for END-like keywords further improve such cues, such as codice_34 versus codice_35, and end-loop marker specifying the index variable codice_36 versus codice_37, and uniquely named loops codice_38 versus codice_39. However, modern source code editors often provide visual indicators, such as syntax highlighting, and features such as code folding to assist with these drawbacks.

==Productivity==
In the language Scala, early versions allowed curly braces only. Scala 3 added an option to use indenting to structure blocks. Designer Martin Odersky said that this was the single most important way Scala 3 improved his own productivity, that it makes programs over 10% shorter and keeps programmers &quot;in the flow&quot;, and advises its use.

* Beginning of a paragraph
* Hierarchy subordinate concept
* Quotation

Many computer languages use &quot;block indentation&quot; to demarcate blocks of source code.

Indentation is essentially the same regardless of whether the writing system is left-to-right (e.g. Latin and Cyrillic) or right-to-left (e.g. Hebrew and Arabic) when considering line beginning and end. For example, indenting at the beginning of line means on the left for a left-to-right script and on the right for right-to-left script.

Indent is both a noun and a verb. The verb is the act of formatting text to be indented whereas the noun refers to the resulting empty space.

== Types ==
There are three main types of indentation: first-line, hanging and block.

Each example below is in a box that represents the page boundary and uses the common typesetting lorem ipsum content. The width of indentation here is in units of em spaces.




== Indentation in programming ==

In computer programming, indentation describes formatting source code with whitespace to the left of code text often to visually show that a sequence of code lines is syntactically a code block. Typically, the lines of a block are aligned with an amount of white space that indicates the block&#x27;s depth in the hierarchical structure of the code. Each inner level of the hierarchy is indented by a multiple of this &quot;indentation width&quot;.

White space in code is typically stored as whitespace characters.

For a free-form language, indentation is exclusively for the programmer since a code processor (i.e. compiler, interpreter) ignores whitespace characters. Code can have inconsistent or even no indentation, but in general is formatted with somewhat consistent indentation.

Some languages rely on indentation to demarcate block structure, often via the off-side rule. Due to this syntax requirement, the code must have a level of consistency that is not required in free-form language code.

The neologisms outdent, unindent and dedent describe the opposite of indentation aligning code text of a line to the left of the previous line.

=== Variations ===

Common variations in the implementation of indentation include: how much to indent a block at each level of the code hierarchy, usually measured in spaces, and whether to store whitespace characters as space or tab characters.
Although there are common practices, consensus is not universal.

These variations are driven by factors that may include but are not limited to: language syntax, organizational mandate and personal preference.

=== Common practices ===

The following table identifies notable practices with respect to code indentation.

=== Elastic tabstops ===

In 2006, a new method of indentation was proposed, called elastic tabstops.

<text>Norwood Park is one of the 77 Chicago community areas. It encompasses the smaller neighborhoods of Big Oaks, Norwood Park East, Norwood Park West, Old Norwood Park, Oriole Park, and Union Ridge.

The community area contains the oldest extant building in Chicago, the Noble–Seymour–Crippen House, built in 1833 and greatly expanded in 1868. Organized in 1873 as a township from the adjacent townships of Jefferson, Leyden, Niles, and Maine, and named after Henry Ward Beecher&#x27;s 1868 novel &quot;Norwood, or Village Life in New England&quot; (With the &quot;Park&quot; added to account for another post office in Illinois with the Norwood name), Norwood Park was incorporated as a village in 1874 and annexed to Chicago on November 7, 1893.

Every Memorial Day since 1922 there has been a parade that runs through Norwood Park. William Howard Taft High School, best known as the inspiration for the musical &quot;Grease&quot;, was completed in 1939 with major additions made in 1959 and 1974.

==History==
The first inhabitant of European descent in the area was Mark Noble, who arrived in 1833 and constructed a house that is still standing as of 2024, the oldest in the Chicago city limits. English farmers were the main group in the 1830s, although they would later be supplanted by Germans and to a lesser extent Poles and Scandinavians. In 1853 the Illinois and Wisconsin Railroad, which would eventually become the Chicago and North Western Railway and is currently Metra&#x27;s Union Pacific / Northwest Line, laid tracks in the area, and in 1868 the Norwood Land and Building Association was formed and purchased the land. A hotel was constructed shortly thereafter in an attempt to lure tourists from Chicago, although it was ultimately unsuccessful. The first Post Office and store were built respectively in 1870 and 1871.

Upon its incorporation the Village of Norwood Park prohibited the sale of alcohol. As of April 2014 there were still eight dry precincts in the community area. The first liquor store in the area in 50 years opened in 2016, without controversy about its existence but with such restrictions on its operation as early closing hours and a price minimum of $5.99.

During the 1920s such roads as Foster Avenue, Milwaukee Avenue, Devon Avenue, Northwest Highway, and Harlem Avenue were improved, further facilitating transportation between Norwood Park and its surroundings. The fieldhouse of the eponymous Norwood Park was built in 1928. Between 1930 and 1940 the area added approximately 2,000 residents despite the Great Depression. The Kennedy Expressway was constructed nearby in the 1950s although the historic buildings of Old Norwood were unaffected. The Norwood Park Chamber of Commerce was incorporated on May 20, 1977. The City of Chicago recognized the Norwood Park Historical District in 1986 and declared the Noble-Seymour-Crippen House a Chicago Landmark on May 11, 1988. The Noble-Seymour-Crippen House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 11, 2000.

==Neighborhoods==

===Norwood Park Historical District (Old Norwood)===

The Norwood Park Historical District, also known as Old Norwood, was recognized by the City of Chicago in 1986. It contains the Noble-Seymour-Crippen House, Wingert House, Taft High School, and the Norwood Park Public School.

===Norwood Park East===
Norwood Park East is bounded by Niles, the north branch of the Chicago River, Devon Avenue, Indian Road, Austin Avenue, Bryn Mawr Avenue, Avondale Avenue and Harlem Avenue. The Roden branch of the Chicago Public Library system is located in the neighborhood. The public school that is located in the central part of the area and that the area is mostly zoned to is William J. Onahan Public School, located on West Raven Street. Rufus M. Hitch Public School, located on North McVicker Avenue, is in the area and zoned to as well. The neighborhood is also home to St. Thecla Catholic School and Parish.

===Norwood Park West===
Norwood Park West is bounded by Devon Avenue, Harlem Avenue, the Kennedy Expressway and Canfield Road. It is home to Edison Park Elementary School, despite the name implying a location in Edison Park. It is also home to Immaculate Conception Catholic School, Resurrection Medical Center and Resurrection High School.

===Big Oaks===
Big Oaks is bounded by Foster Avenue to the north, Nagle Avenue to the east, Gunnison Street to the south, and Harlem Avenue to the west. Opposite of the neighborhood&#x27;s southern border at Gunnison Street is the suburb of Harwood Heights and an unincorporated area housing Ridgemoor Country Club. Many of the city&#x27;s police officers live in Big Oaks, and in recent years the area has seen an increase in the number of Polish immigrants.

At one time, the area was dominated by a large golf course called Big Oaks Golf Course. In the early 1950s, the golf course was demolished, and hundreds of homes replaced it.

The neighborhood contains three schools: Daniel Carter Beard Elementary School, located on West Strong Avenue, John W. Garvy Elementary School, located on West Foster Avenue, and St. Monica Academy, located on North Mont Clare Avenue.

===Oriole Park===
Oriole Park is bordered by the Kennedy Expressway to the north, Foster Ave to the south, Harlem Avenue to the east, and Cumberland Avenue to the west.

The area is home to Oriole Park, which is located in the center of the neighborhood south of Bryn Mawr Avenue. The park covers over of land. The park is a Chicago Park District facility.

The Oriole Park Library is located on Balmoral Avenue next to Oriole Park Elementary School. It operates under the Chicago Public Library.

The neighborhood contains two schools: Oriole Park Elementary School, located on Oketo and Balmoral Avenues, and St. Eugene Catholic School, located on Foster and Canfield Avenues.

Due to its proximity on the edge of Chicago and its suburban feel, Oriole Park residents are primarily city workers, such as teachers, police officers, union workers and firefighters.

===Union Ridge===
Union Ridge, one of the highest points of Cook County, is bounded by Bryn Mawr, Foster, Nagle, and Harlem Avenues. Union Ridge contains no schools. Union Ridge Cemetery is located on Higgins and Talcott Avenues.

==Demographics==
As of 2015, the median household income of the community area was $71,282 and the median age was 44.3. 80.1% of the population was White, 0.9% was Black, 4.2% was Asian, and 2.2% was Other. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 11.8% of the population. This is a marked change from 2000, when Whites were 92.7% of the population and Hispanics or Latinos were 6.4%.

Although predominantly Irish, the Norwood Park neighborhood has a substantial Serbian-American community, centered on Serbian Road and the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral. There is a K-8 Serbian-American School, Saint Sava Academy, and an annual Serbian festival &quot;Serb Fest&quot; which takes place on Serbian Road. During 1990-1999 more than 500 Serbian families from Croatia and another 700 from Bosnia became settled refugees in Norwood Park. Although many have since moved into Edison Park, Park Ridge, Harwood Heights, and Schiller Park, Norwood Park remains the hub of Serbian migrants in Chicago.
==Politics==
===Local===
The community area is split between the 39th, 41st, and 45th wards of the Chicago City Council, where it is represented by Democrat Samantha Nugent, Independent Anthony Napolitano, and Democrat Jim Gardiner respectively.
In the Cook County Board of Commissioners the large majority of the area is in the 9th district, represented by Republican Peter N. Silvestri, while the eastern parts of Norwood Park East, Union Ridge, and Big Oaks are in the 10th district, represented by Democrat Bridget Gainer. As of 2018 Silvestri is the only Republican County Commissioner representing a part of the City of Chicago.

===State===
In the Illinois House of Representatives the majority of the community area is located within District 20, represented by Republican Michael P. McAuliffe, while most of Union Ridge and Big Oaks is in District 19, represented by Democrat Robert Martwick, and a tiny fraction in the northeast is part of District 15, represented by Democrat John D&#x27;Amico.

In the Illinois Senate the vast majority of the community area is located within District 10, represented by Democrat John G. Mulroe, while a tiny part in the northeast is part of District 8, represented by Democrat Ira I. Silverstein.

===Federal===
In the United States House of Representatives it is split between Illinois&#x27;s 5th and Illinois&#x27;s 9th congressional districts, where it is respectively represented by Democrats Mike Quigley and Jan Schakowsky.

Norwood Park has supported the Democratic nominee for President in the past two presidential elections. In the 2016 presidential election, Norwood Park cast 9,894 votes (51.81%) for Hillary Clinton and cast 8,280 votes (43.36%) for Donald Trump. In the 2012 presidential election, Norwood Park cast 8,441 votes (54.19%) for Barack Obama and cast 6,833 votes (43.86%) for Mitt Romney.

==Education==
Chicago Public Schools serves Norwood Park, as the aforementioned schools are located in and serve the area. Taft High School is in Norwood Park, serving the entire community area for public education, while for secondary education Luther North and Resurrection High Schools are also in the area.

==Relation to &quot;Grease&quot; Musical==
&quot;Grease&quot; creator Jim Jacobs attended Taft High School, which was used as the backdrop to Grease. Much of what is in the play is based on his experience growing up in Norwood Park during the 1950s and 1960s. He has stated that the characters of Grease were based on actual people he attended school with. A 2011 reproduction of the original &quot;Grease&quot; musical by American Theater Company in Chicago revisited Norwood Park&#x27;s influence on the production. During the reproduction, many Chicago references were put in, including references to the characters living on &quot;Chicago&#x27;s Northwest side&quot; as middle class first-generation Americans with parents who worked in local factories. Also mentioned were local favorites, including the hot dog restaurant Superdawg.

<text>Joseph Ezekiel Strick (July 6, 1923 – June 1, 2010) was an American director, producer and screenwriter.

==Life and career==
Born in the Pittsburgh area town of Braddock, Pennsylvania, Strick briefly attended UCLA, then enrolled in the U.S. Army during World War II. In the Army, he served as a cameraman in the Army Air Forces.

In 1948, he and Irving Lerner produced &quot;Muscle Beach&quot;. For several years in the 1950s, Lerner, Strick, Ben Maddow, and Sidney Meyers worked part-time on the experimental documentary &quot;The Savage Eye&quot; (1959).

Strick was also a successful businessman, founding Electrosolids Corp (1956), Computron Corp. (1958), Physical Sciences Corp (1958), and Holosonics Corp. (1960). In 1977 he invented the usage of six-axis motion simulators as entertainment systems and applied it to new machines used now in Disney theme parks as &quot;Star Tours.&quot;

In the 1960s, during his first marriage, Strick commissioned what was the only house designed by Oscar Niemeyer in North America. The marriage ended in divorce before construction was completed, and Strick never occupied the house, located on the edge of Santa Monica Canyon.

&quot;The Savage Eye&quot; won the BAFTA Flaherty Documentary Award and was hailed as part of an &quot;American New Wave&quot; alongside the work of Shirley Clarke and John Cassavetes. In 1970, he won an Academy Award for Best Documentary for his movie &quot;Interviews with My Lai Veterans&quot;. His better known ventures include a film adaptation of James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; as well as &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot; (1983). He also directed &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;, based on the novel by Henry Miller.

In Britain, he directed at the Royal Shakespeare Company (1964) and the National Theatre (2003).

Joseph Strick&#x27;s career led him to share his time in Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris. He died in a Paris hospital of congestive heart failure.

The moving image collection of Joseph Strick is held at the Academy Film Archive. The collection consists of over one hundred items, including negative and print materials. The Academy Film Archive has preserved several of Strick&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Savage Eye&quot; and &quot;Muscle Beach&quot;.

<doc id="605637" wikidata="Q4119533" url="?curid=605637" title="Victoria College, Alexandria">
<text>Victoria College, Alexandria, () is an Egyptian private school, operating under the supervision of Ministry of Education, located in the city of Alexandria, Egypt. It was founded in 1902.

The school was founded under the impetus of the recently ennobled Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer of the Barings Bank, that was heavily invested in Egyptian stability. For years the British Consul-General was &quot;ex officio&quot; on the board of Victoria College. The new college was to raise the standard of Imperial education and free it from the influences of the madrassas and the ubiquitous Jesuits, both of whom made the British foreign office uneasy. Among prominent subscribers to the project were members of the prominent internationalized Jewish and Maltese minority in Egypt including members of the Egyptian Royal family. Prior to the 1930s establishment of Baghdad College, members of the upper class of Iraq sent their children to Victoria College.

==History==
During World War II, many displaced European royals and nobles were added to the student body:
:&quot; As the situation worsened north of the Mediterranean, scions of European monarchies expanded the student body further so that Romanovs, Saxe-Coburgs, Hohenzollerns, Zogos and Glucksburgs rubbed shoulders with the Hashemites, Mahdis and al-Sharifs. While most were treated like regular students some stood out because of restrictions imposed upon them. The Albanian royals, the Zogos, for instance, were constantly trailed by massive bodyguards, which is perhaps why they did not last long at Victoria. Years later, many among the Arab elite students would meet again this time as major players in rising petrodollar economies.&quot; (Samir Raafat)

The British Imperial-outpost phase of Victoria College ended abruptly in 1956, the year that began with the dissolution of Anglo-Egyptian cooperation and saw the Suez Crisis in October. The entire British faculty was fired, including then headmaster Herbert Barritt. The school was renamed later to &quot;Victory College&quot; and continues to operate until this day.

At Victoria College on El Iqbal Street, former Bulgarian King and Prime Minister Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha attended classes along with schoolmates such as King Hussein of Jordan, Zaid Al Rifai, the exiled Prince of Ottoman dynasty Osman Osmanoglu, the Kashoggi brothers (whose father was one of Saudi King Abdulaziz&#x27;s physicians), Kamal Adham (who ran the Saudi external intelligence directorate under King Faisal), scholar Edward Said, present-day Saudi businessmen Mohammed Al Attas, Ambassador Mohamed Faqi and Ambassador Fouad Faqi.Shobokshi brothers and Ghassan Shaker —Internationally famous director Youssef Chahine, and actor Omar Sharif and many Princes from the Libyan Royal family and the Jordanian Royal Family.

<doc id="605639" wikidata="Q5282127" url="?curid=605639" title="Disease model of addiction">
<text>The disease model of addiction describes an addiction as a disease with genetic, biological, neurological or environmental origin. The traditional medical model of disease requires only an abnormal condition causing distress, discomfort or dysfunction to an affected individual. The contemporary medical model partly attributes addiction to changes in the brain&#x27;s mesolimbic pathway. The model also considers these diseases as a result of other biological, psychological or sociological entities, despite an incomplete understanding of their mechanisms. The common biomolecular mechanisms underlying addiction – CREB and ΔFosB – were reviewed by Eric J. Nestler in a 2013 review. Genetics and mental disorders may precipitate the severity of a drug addiction. It is estimated that 50% of healthy individuals developing an addiction can trace the cause to genetic factors.

==Criticism==
However, the model does not come without criticisms. Critics of the model, especially those subscribed to the life-process model of addiction, believe that labelling people as &quot;addicts&quot; prevents them from developing self-control and due to social stigmas. As noted by harm reduction specialist Andrew Tatarsky:

<text>Totley Tunnel is a tunnel under Totley Moor, on the Hope Valley line between Totley on the outskirts of Sheffield and Grindleford in Derbyshire, England. 

==Construction==
Totley Tunnel was constructed by the Midland Railway on its line between Sheffield and Manchester via the Hope Valley. The engineers were Parry and Storey of Nottingham and the contractor for of the railway, including the tunnel, was Thomas Oliver of Horsham, West Sussex. Work began in 1888 with the construction of three brick surveying towers along the tunnel&#x27;s proposed line, followed by a vertical shafts to the level of the rails. The Duke of Rutland had decreed that no more than one ventilation shaft should be sunk through his land and that work should cease from August to October, during the grouse shooting season. Four permanent and three temporary shafts were sunk near to the Totley end. The latter were cut through shale, and water was encountered in the first eight feet. The permanent shafts took longer, encountering beds of ganister, coal and rock.

As the headings were driven from the base of each shaft, water flow increased to per day – equivalent to per second. At the Padley (Grindleford) end, the situation was little better and work stopped for several weeks until a drain was laid. Then, at about , a spring was encountered which flooded the workings at per hour or per second. A raft was used to inspect the workings. Shortly after that, the shale became drier and work proceeded toward Totley, the headings finally meeting in 1892.

The tunnel was the proving ground of a number of boring machines for the shot holes, using gelignite to blast the rock. No limit was set on the amount and, in all, some were used. The atmosphere in the workings was hot and humid, and compressed air used for ventilation. For a time at the Padley end, a turbine was installed in the Burbage Brook to drive a fan.

During construction a natural cavern, several hundred square feet in area, was discovered, which was incorporated into the tunnel and a large air shaft was installed to the surface. The entrance to the cavern can be seen on the up side (towards Sheffield) of the tunnel halfway through.

Because of the damp conditions, the workforce suffered outbreaks of typhoid, diphtheria, smallpox and scarlet fever. Accommodation was scarce, and the workers lived often twenty to thirty in a house. Working 24-hour shifts, as soon as one man got out of his bed, another would take his place, with little in the way of washing or sanitary facilities.

At the time the tunnel was completed in 1893, it was the second-longest railway tunnel in the UK, the older Severn Tunnel being longer. Passenger services commenced in 1894. After the two High Speed 1 tunnels opened in 2007, it became the fourth longest mainline railway tunnel in the UK.

Because of its length, in addition to the Midland&#x27;s normal block system, signal wires were installed which, when cut, caused alarms to ring in the signal boxes at each end. The same system was used in the shorter Cowburn and Clay Cross Tunnels.

From the Hope Valley towards Totley the tunnel starts level, then falls on gradients of 1 in 150, 1 in 176, and 1 in 100.

The Totley History Group examined the life history of Joseph Hibberd, a labourer, who was injured whilst building the tunnel, and lingered, &quot;crippled&quot;, for &quot;five years&quot;. His grave has an inscription from Philippians 3:8.

==Services ==
Totley Tunnel is frequently used by both passenger trains between Sheffield and Manchester and freight lines operating from Hope. The passenger services are operated by Northern Trains, which operates a regular stopping service at the Hope Valley stations, TransPennine Express and East Midlands Railway. Above ground, there are a number of ventilation shafts still visible along the Dore and Totley Moss moorland. Several shafts are visible in Dore from Strawberry Lee Road, but safety railings have now been added across the top of the shafts. Additionally, the Western portal is easily observed by hikers at its location in Grindleford.

<text>Charles Churchill (February 1732 – 4 November 1764) was an English poet and satirist.

==Early life==
Churchill was born in Vine Street, Westminster. His father, Rev. Charles Churchill, was rector of Rainham, Essex, held the curacy and lectureship of St Johns, Westminster, from 1733, and Charles was educated at Westminster School, where he became a good classical scholar, and formed a close and lasting friendship with Robert Lloyd. He was admitted to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge on 8 July 1748. Churchill contracted a marriage with a Miss Scot within the rules of the Fleet in his eighteenth year, and never lived at Cambridge; the young couple lived in his father&#x27;s house, and Churchill was afterwards sent to the north of England to prepare for holy orders.

He became curate of the church of St Thomas à Becket in South Cadbury, Somerset, and, on receiving priest&#x27;s orders (1756), began to act as his father&#x27;s curate at Rainham. Two years later the elder Churchill died, and the son was elected to succeed him in his curacy and lectureship. His emoluments amounted to less than £100 a year, and he increased his income by teaching in a girls&#x27; school. His marriage proved unhappy, and he began to spend much of his time in dissipation in the society of Robert Lloyd. He was separated from his wife in 1761, and would have been imprisoned for debt but for the timely help of Lloyd&#x27;s father, Pierson Lloyd, who had been an usher and was now second master at Westminster School.

==Satirist==
Churchill had already done some work for the booksellers, and his friend Lloyd had had some success with a didactic poem, &quot;The Actor&quot;. Churchill&#x27;s knowledge of the theatre was now made use of in the &quot;Rosciad&quot;, which appeared in March 1761. This reckless and amusing satire described with the most disconcerting accuracy the faults of the various actors and actresses on the London stage; in a competition judged by Shakespeare and Jonson, Garrick is named the greatest English actor. Its immediate popularity was no doubt largely due to its personal character, but its vigour and raciness make it worth reading even now when the objects of Churchill&#x27;s wit are forgotten.

The first impression was published anonymously, and in the &quot;Critical Review&quot;, conducted by Tobias Smollett, it was confidently asserted that the poem was the joint production of George Colman the Elder, Bonnell Thornton and Robert Lloyd. Churchill immediately published an &quot;Apology addressed to the Critical Reviewers&quot;, which, after developing the subject that it is only authors who prey on their own kind, repeats the fierce attack on the stage. Incidentally it contains an enthusiastic tribute to John Dryden, of whom Churchill was a devotee. In the &quot;Rosciad&quot; he had praised Mrs Pritchard, Mrs Cibber and Mrs Clive, but no leading London actor, with the exception of David Garrick, had escaped censure, and in the &quot;Apology&quot; Garrick was clearly threatened. He deprecated criticism by showing every possible civility to Churchill, who became a terror to the actors. Thomas Davies wrote to Garrick attributing his blundering in the part of Cymbeline &quot;to my accidentally seeing Mr Churchill in the pit, it rendering me confused and unmindful of my business.&quot;

Churchill&#x27;s satire made him many enemies, and brought reprisals. In &quot;Night, an Epistle to Robert Lloyd&quot; (1761), he answered the attacks made on him, offering by way of defense the argument that any faults were better than hypocrisy. His scandalous conduct brought down the censure of the dean of Westminster, and in 1763 the protests of his parishioners led him to resign his offices, and he was free to wear his blue coat with metal buttons and much gold lace without remonstrance from the dean. &quot;The Rosciad&quot; had been refused by several publishers, and was finally published at Churchill&#x27;s own expense. He received a considerable sum from the sale, and paid his old creditors in full, besides making an allowance to his wife.

==Friendship with Wilkes==
In 1761 or 1762 he became a close ally and friend with the champion of liberty of the press John Wilkes, whom he regularly assisted with &quot;The North Briton&quot; weekly newspaper. His collaboration with Wilkes thereafter earned him an honourable place in the history of parliamentary democracy and civil liberties.

His next poem, &quot;The Prophecy of Famine: A Scots Pastoral&quot; (1763), was founded on a paper written originally for &quot;The North Briton&quot;. This violent satire on Scottish influence fell in with the current hatred of Lord Bute, and the Scottish place-hunters were as much alarmed as the actors had been. When Wilkes was arrested he gave Churchill a timely hint to retire to the country for a time, the publisher, Kearsley, having stated that he received part of the profits from the paper. His &quot;Epistle to William Hogarth&quot; (1763) was in answer to the caricature of Wilkes made during the trial, in it Hogarth&#x27;s vanity and envy were attacked in an invective which Garrick quoted as shocking and barbarous. Hogarth retaliated with an engraving based on his &quot;The Painter and his Pug&quot;, which caricatures Churchill as a bear in torn clerical bands hugging a pot of porter and a club made of lies and &quot;NB&quot;, while Hogarth&#x27;s pug Trump urinates on Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Epistle&quot;.

&quot;The Duellist&quot; (1763) is a virulent satire on the most active opponents of Wilkes in the House of Lords, especially on Bishop Warburton. He attacked Dr Johnson among others in &quot;The Ghost&quot; as &quot;Pomposo, insolent and loud, Vain idol of a scribbling crowd&quot;. Other poems are &quot;The Conference&quot; (1763); &quot;The Author&quot; (1763), highly praised by Churchill&#x27;s contemporaries; &quot;Gotham&quot; (1764), a poem on the duties of a king, didactic rather than satiric in tone; &quot;The Candidate&quot; (1764), a satire on John Montagu, fourth earl of Sandwich, one of Wilkes&#x27;s bitterest enemies, whom he had already denounced for his treachery in &quot;The Duellist&quot; (Bk. iii.) as too infamous to have a friend; &quot;The Farewell&quot; (1764); &quot;The Times&quot; (1764); &quot;Independence&quot;, and an unfinished &quot;Journey&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
In October 1764 he went to Boulogne to join Wilkes. There he was attacked by a fever of which he died on 4 November. He left his property to his two sons, and made Wilkes his literary executor with full powers. Wilkes did little. He wrote an epitaph for his friend and about half a dozen notes on his poems, and Andrew Kippis acknowledges some slight assistance from him in preparing his life of Churchill for the &quot;Biographia&quot; (1780). There is more than one instance of Churchill&#x27;s generosity to his friends. In 1763 he found his friend Robert Lloyd in prison for debt. He paid a guinea a week for his better maintenance in the Fleet, and raised a subscription to set him free. Lloyd fell ill on receipt of the news of Churchill&#x27;s death, and died shortly afterwards. Churchill&#x27;s sister Patty, who was engaged to Lloyd, did not long survive them. William Cowper was his schoolfellow, and left many kindly references to him.

A partial collection of Churchill&#x27;s poems appeared in 1763.

<doc id="605652" wikidata="Q127171" url="?curid=605652" title="Jean-Honoré Fragonard">
<text>Jean-Honoré Fragonard (; 5 April 1732 – 22 August 1806) was a French painter and printmaker whose late Rococo manner was distinguished by remarkable facility, exuberance, and hedonism. One of the most prolific artists active in the last decades of the Ancien Régime, Fragonard produced more than 550 paintings (not counting drawings and etchings), of which only five are dated. Among his most popular works are genre paintings conveying an atmosphere of intimacy and veiled eroticism.

==Biography==

Jean-Honoré Fragonard was born in Grasse, Alpes-Maritimes, France the only child of François Fragonard, a glover, and Françoise Petit.
Fragonard was apprenticed to a Paris notary when his father&#x27;s circumstances became strained through unsuccessful speculations, but showed such talent and inclination for art that he was taken at the age of eighteen to François Boucher. Boucher recognized the youth&#x27;s rare gifts but, disinclined to waste his time with one so inexperienced, sent him to Chardin&#x27;s atelier. Fragonard studied for a short time with Chardin then returned more fully equipped to Boucher, whose style he soon acquired so completely that the master entrusted him with the execution of replicas of his paintings.

Though not yet a student of the Academy, Fragonard gained the Prix de Rome in 1752 with a painting of &quot;Jeroboam Sacrificing to Idols&quot;, but before proceeding to Rome he continued to study for three years under Charles-André van Loo. In the year preceding his departure he painted the &quot;Christ washing the Feet of the Apostles&quot; now at Grasse Cathedral. In December 1756, he took up his abode at the French Academy in Rome, then presided over by Charles-Joseph Natoire.

While at Rome, Fragonard contracted a friendship with a fellow painter Hubert Robert. In 1760, they toured Italy together, executing numerous sketches of local scenery. It was in these romantic gardens, with their fountains, grottoes, temples and terraces, that Fragonard conceived the dreams which he was subsequently to render in his art. He also learned to admire the masters of the Dutch and Flemish schools (Rubens, Hals, Rembrandt, Ruisdael), imitating their loose and vigorous brushstrokes. Added to this influence was the deep impression made upon his mind by the florid sumptuousness of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, whose works he had an opportunity to study in Venice before he returned to Paris in 1761.

In 1765 his &quot;Coresus Sacrificing Himself to Save Callirhoe&quot; secured his admission to the Academy. It was made the subject of a pompous (though not wholly serious) eulogy by Denis Diderot, and was bought by the king, who had it reproduced at the Gobelins factory. Until this time Fragonard had hesitated between religious, classic and other subjects; but now the demand of the wealthy art patrons of Louis XV&#x27;s pleasure-loving and licentious court turned him definitely towards those scenes of love and voluptuousness, which are only made acceptable by the tender beauty of his color and the virtuosity of his facile brushwork; such works include the &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot; (&quot;Le collin maillard&quot;), &quot;Serment d&#x27;amour&quot; (Love Vow), &quot;Le Verrou&quot; (The Bolt), &quot;La Culbute&quot; (The Tumble), &quot;La Chemise enlevée&quot; (The Raised Chemise), and &quot;L&#x27;escarpolette&quot; (The Swing, Wallace Collection), and his decorations for the apartments of Mme du Barry and the dancer Madeleine Guimard. The portrait of Diderot (1769) has recently had its attribution to Fragonard called into question.
A lukewarm response to these series of ambitious works induced Fragonard to abandon the Rococo style and to experiment with Neoclassicism. He married Marie-Anne Gérard, herself a painter of miniatures, (1745–1823) on 17 June 1769 and had a daughter, Rosalie Fragonard (1769–1788), who became one of his favourite models. In October 1773, he again went to Italy with Pierre-Jacques Onézyme Bergeret de Grancourt and his son, Pierre-Jacques Bergeret de Grancourt. In September 1774, he returned through Vienna, Prague, Dresden, Frankfurt and Strasbourg.

Back in Paris Marguerite Gérard, his wife&#x27;s 14-year-old sister, became his student and assistant in 1778. In 1780, he had a son, Alexandre-Évariste Fragonard (1780–1850), who eventually became a talented painter and sculptor. The French Revolution deprived Fragonard of his private patrons: they were either guillotined or exiled. The neglected painter deemed it prudent to leave Paris in 1790 and found shelter in the house of his cousin Alexandre Maubert at Grasse, which he decorated with the series of decorative panels known as the &quot;Les progrès de l&#x27;amour dans le cœur d&#x27;une jeune fille&quot;, originally painted for Château du Barry.
== Reputation ==
For half a century or more, Fragonard was so completely ignored that Wilhelm Lübke&#x27;s 1873 art history volume omits mention of his name. Later re-evaluations have re-identified his position among the all-time masters of French painting. The influence of his handling of local colour and expressive, confident brushstroke on the Impressionists (particularly his grand niece, Berthe Morisot, and Renoir) is undoubtable. Fragonard&#x27;s paintings, alongside those of François Boucher, seem to sum up an era.

One of Fragonard&#x27;s most renowned paintings is &quot;The Swing&quot;, also known as &quot;The Happy Accidents of the Swing&quot; (its original title), an oil painting in the Wallace Collection in London. It is considered to be one of the masterpieces of the rococo era, and is Fragonard&#x27;s best-known work. The painting portrays a young gentleman concealed in the bushes, observing a lady on swing being pushed by her spouse, who is standing in the background, hidden in the shadows, as he is unaware of the affair. As the lady swings forward, the young man gets a glimpse under her dress. 
According to Charles Collé&#x27;s memoirs a young nobleman had requested this portrait of his mistress seated on a swing. He asked first Gabriel François Doyen to make this painting of him and his mistress. Not comfortable with this frivolous work, Doyen refused and passed on the commission to Fragonard.

== References within art and literature ==
Fragonard&#x27;s art finds itself embedded within writer&#x27;s stories, as within the text &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald there is a portion in the story in which Peter L. Hays in the article &quot;Fitzgerald and Fragonard&quot; states that Fitzgerald alludes to Fragonard&#x27;s paintings both implied and explicitly. The first art piece Fitzgerald alludes to is &quot;The Swing&quot;, as the character Nick within &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as he describes what he sees as women swinging in Versailles while a man looks up the skirt of a woman. The is the explicit description that Fitzgerald gives the readers as a clue that alludes to Jean-Honoré Fragonard&#x27;s painting &quot;The Swing.&quot; Hays also claims that F. Scott Fitzgerald is alluding to a second painting of Fragonard which is his rendering of Etienne Maurice Falconet&#x27;s &quot;Cupid the Admonisher&quot; in which Cupid is seen with his finger on his lips referencing the clandestine nature of what the character Nick in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; is looking at. This is because the man that is seen in &quot;The Swing&quot; has a perfect view of the young woman&#x27;s underside of her dress.

Octave Mirbeau&#x27;s short story &quot;The Little Summer-House&quot; in the collective book &quot;French Decadent Tales&quot; by Stephen Romer directly references Fragonard&#x27;s art pieces when an unnamed character is taken into a bathroom and is stuck between two emotions disapproval or pleasure.

Fragonard&#x27;s art also finds itself within not only stories, but poems as well. The poem &quot;The Lamentation of the Old Pensioner&quot; by William Butler Yeats, in which he uses the description of a broken tree and a woman that turns her face as another allusion to Fragonard&#x27;s &quot;The Swing&quot; once again, as the branch the woman uses to swing on is broken and facing the viewer.

Fragonard&#x27;s art finds itself in a poem passage &quot;The Waste Land&quot; written by T.S Eliot which visually depicts the &quot;carvéd dolphin&quot; surmounted by winged cupids in Fragonard’s &quot;Progress of Love: The Pursuit&quot;.

Fragonard is also referenced in a novel written by Milan Kundera &quot;Slowness&quot; which talks about Fragonards paintings &quot;Progress of Love&quot;, which shows the progress of love, from pursuing, love letters, and crowning the lover, which shows the slowness of pursuing a lover.
There have also been many artistic installations inspired Fragonard&#x27;s work, some including actual recreations of his paintings come to life. The Swing (After Fragonard) is a 2001 exhibit that physically recreates Fragonard&#x27;s &quot;The Swing&quot;, creating a real life exhibit of the famous scene of the girl swinging. Artist Yinka Shonibare CBE puts his own spin on Fragonard&#x27;s work, such as using a mannequin wearing a dress made of frilly African print fabric, or choosing to not give the mannequin a head or face. He also keeps the background a neutral white with wooden flooring, which contrasts the bright colors of the dress, and the many flowers he plants at the base of the exhibit. He keeps the flying shoe as seen in the actual painting, as well as the suggestive and upbeat pose of a girl swinging midair, ensuring that the sculpture still closely reflects Fragonard&#x27;s &quot;The Swing&quot;, even with the different renditions of Shonibare.

Artist Cy Twombly also references Fragonard in his 1928 painting &quot;Untitled.&quot; He takes elements of Fragonard&#x27;s work and reinterprets them in his own abstract and expressive style. &quot;Untitled&quot; is an abstract piece made up of loose and energetic lines that portray motion and vigor. The palette of Twombly&#x27;s painting is close to the famous work of Fragonard in that it uses light and airy colors, while representing a sort of sexual and provocative energy.

<text>Anund (, meaning &quot;trail-blazer Anund&quot; or &quot;Anund the Land Clearer&quot;), also called &quot;Brøt-Anundr&quot; (Old East Norse) or &quot;Braut-Önundr&quot; (Old West Norse) was a semi-legendary Swedish king of the House of Yngling who reigned in the mid-seventh century. The form of the name used during his lifetime would have been Proto-Norse *&quot;Anuwinduz&quot;, meaning &quot;winning ancestor&quot;.

==Life==

In his &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Snorri Sturluson relates that Anund succeeded his father King Yngvar who fell in battle with the Estonians. After his father&#x27;s wars against Danish Vikings and Estonian Vikings, peace reigned over Sweden and there were good harvests. Anund was a popular king who became very rich, not only because of the peace and the good harvests but also because he avenged his father in Estonia. That country was ravaged far and wide and in the autumn Anund returned with great riches.

In those days Sweden was dominated by vast and uninhabited forests, so Anund started making roads and clearing land, and vast districts were settled by Swedes. Consequently, he was named &quot;Bröt-Anund&quot;. He made a farm for himself in every district and used to stay as a guest in many homes.

One autumn, King Anund was travelling between his halls (see Husbys) and came to a place called &quot;Himinheiðr&quot; (sky heath) between two mountains. He was surprised by a landslide which killed him.

After presenting this story of Anund, Snorri Sturluson quotes Þjóðólfr of Hvinir&#x27;s &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;:

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation (continuing after Ingvar Harra):
The original text of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; is hard to interpret, and it only says that Anund died &quot;und Himinfjöllum&quot; (under the sky mountains) and that stones were involved. According to &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, he was murdered by his brother Sigvard &quot;in Himinherthy&quot; (which the source says means &quot;the fields of the sky&quot;, &quot;cœli campus&quot;). A place with this name is not known, and Swedish archaeologist Birger Nerman (1888–1971) suggests that the original place of death was under the &quot;sky mountains&quot;, i.e. under the clouds (cf. the etymology of &quot;cloud&quot;). Consequently, he may have been killed outdoors, by his brother and with a stone.

&quot;Thorsteins saga Víkingssonar&quot; says that Anund was not the son of Ingvar Harra, but Östen. It also relates that he had a brother named Olaf who was the king of Fjordane.

All sources say that Anund was the father of Ingjald (&quot;Ingjald Illråde&quot;).

<doc id="605657" wikidata="Q6786965" url="?curid=605657" title="Matheson Fire">
<text>The great Matheson Fire was a deadly forest fire that passed through the region surrounding the communities of Black River-Matheson and Iroquois Falls, Ontario, Canada, on July 29, 1916.

As was common practice at the time, settlers cleared land using the slash-and-burn method. That summer, there was little rain, and the forests and underbrush burned easily. In the days leading up to July 29, several smaller fires that had been purposely set merged into a single large firestorm. It was huge; at times its front measured across. The fire moved uncontrollably upon the towns of Porquis Junction, Iroquois Falls, Kelso, Nushka, Matheson, and Ramore, destroying them completely and causing extensive damage to Homer and Monteith. A separate fire burned in and around Cochrane. In all, the fires burned an area of approximately .

Because of forest fire smoke that had covered the region for several weeks and the absence of a forest fire monitoring service, there was almost no warning that the conflagration was upon the communities. Some people escaped on the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway (now the Ontario Northland Railway), while others were saved by wading into the nearby Black River or one of the small lakes in the area. 223 people were killed according to the official estimate.

After the fire, the village of Nushka was completely removed from maps of the region. The village was rebuilt and renamed to Val Gagné, named after local priest Wilfrid Gagne, who died rescuing churchgoers from the fire.

The Matheson Fire led to the creation of the Forest Protection Branch of the Department of Lands, Forests, and Mines (now known as the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry) and the Forest Fires Prevention Act in Ontario.

The great fires are the subject of the books &quot;Killer in the Bush&quot; by Michael Barnes, and &quot;Il pleuvait des oiseaux&quot; by Jocelyne Saucier.

<text>Sailing/Yachting is an Olympic sport starting from the Games of the 1st Olympiad (1896 Olympics in Athens, Greece). With the exception of 1904 and the canceled 1916 Summer Olympics, sailing has always been included on the Olympic schedule. The Sailing program of 1980 consisted of a total of six sailing classes (disciplines). For each class seven races were scheduled from 19 to 29 July 1980 of the coast of Tallinn (district of Pirita, in present-day Estonia), in that time an illegally annexed part of the USSR at the Baltic Sea. The sailing was done on the triangular type Olympic courses.

==Venue==

According to the IOC statutes the contests in all sport disciplines must be held either in, or as close as possible to the city which the IOC has chosen. Since Moscow was not a suitable place the Olympic Yachting Centre in Pirita Tallinn was constructed for the 1980 Olympic Sailing event.

===1980 Olympic boycott===
The boycott affected the medalists in most sailing events with a number of European and World champions not participating. In the Soiling, the Canadian World champion team of Glen Dexter, Andreas Josenhans and [Sandy McMillan] was absent. Some British athletes participated in the Games under a neutral flag, but the sailing federation chose to join the boycott.

<text>Black River-Matheson is a township in the Cochrane District of the Canadian province of Ontario. The municipality is astride the Black River, for which it is partly named. The Matheson railway station was serviced by the Northlander until 2012.

Matheson was first known as McDougall&#x27;s Chute after an early trapper. Renamed for Arthur J. Matheson (1842–1913), provincial Treasurer and M.P.P. for Lanark South.

Mining, forestry and farming are some of the principal industries in the area, augmented by outdoor tourism in the summer, such as fishing and hunting. There are three elementary schools within the municipality.

==Communities==
The communities in the township are Holtyre, Matheson, Ramore, Shillington, Val Gagné, and Wavell. The main community of Matheson is located at the intersection of highways 11 and 101.

==History==

Settlement of Matheson began in 1907 at the same time that the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway was built in the area, and was originally called McDougall Chute, named after Baziel McDougall, a local trapper. It was renamed in 1912 in honour of Colonel Arthur J. Matheson.

Prospecting started in 1909. The Croesus Mine (1914–1918) became &quot;one of the richest mines in Canada&quot;. Gold was like &quot;plums in pudding&quot; and &quot;one gold nugget was egg shaped, two inches long and one and a quarter across.&quot; A total of 16 companies operated in the Harker Holloway area from 1917 to 1925, including Harker Gold Mines. P.A. McDermott found a gold-bearing zone in 1922, which became American Barrick&#x27;s Holt-McDermott Mine in 1988. Located in the Abitibi greenstone belt, the mine produced 60,000 ounces of gold in 1994.

The Great Fire of 1916 left 243 dead.

In 1945, the Township of Black River was incorporated, consisting of the geographic townships of Stock, Taylor, Carr, Beatty, Bond, Currie, Bowman, Hislop, and part of Walker. In 1969, the Township of Black River and the Town of Matheson merged to form the Township of Black River-Matheson, and in 1973, it was enlarged through the addition of Playfair Township and Kingham Improvement District.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Black River-Matheson had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="605671" wikidata="Q1053463" url="?curid=605671" title="Census geographic units of Canada">
<text>The census geographic units of Canada are the census subdivisions defined and used by Canada&#x27;s federal government statistics bureau Statistics Canada to conduct the country&#x27;s quinquennial census. These areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation; they have no government of their own. They exist on four levels: the top-level (first-level) divisions are Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories; these are divided into second-level census divisions, which in turn are divided into third-level census subdivisions (often corresponding to municipalities) and fourth-level dissemination areas.

In some provinces, census divisions correspond to the province&#x27;s second-level administrative divisions such as a county or another similar unit of political organization. In the prairie provinces, census divisions do not correspond to the province&#x27;s administrative divisions, but rather group multiple administrative divisions together. In Newfoundland and Labrador, the boundaries are chosen arbitrarily as no such level of government exists. Two of Canada&#x27;s three territories are also divided into census divisions.

== Census divisions ==

In most cases, a census division corresponds to a single unit of the appropriate type listed above. However, in a few cases, Statistics Canada groups two or more units into a single statistical division:
* In Ontario, Haldimand County and Norfolk County are grouped as a single census division, as are Brant and Brantford. Additionally, in 2023 the government of Ontario expected to change a few district boundaries. One of which is Peel Region, which will be split by 2025, although it is unclear if the census division boundary will remain.
* In Quebec, 93 of 98 census divisions correspond precisely to the territory of one regional county municipality (with the addition of Indian reserves, which do not legally belong to RCMs) or a &quot;territory equivalent to an RCM&quot; (which usually corresponds to a single independent city). However, there are five census divisions consisting of two or three RCMs or equivalent territories each. See List of census divisions of Quebec.
** These are the five census divisions:
**** The CD of Francheville (37) consists of the TE of Trois-Rivières (371) and the RCM of Les Chenaux (372). These two divisions formerly constituted the single RCM of Francheville, which was dissolved in 2002.
**** The CD of Le Saguenay-et-son-Fjord (94) consists of the TE of Saguenay (941) and the RCM of Le Fjord-du-Saguenay (942). Le Fjord-du-Saguenay formerly included the smaller cities which were amalgamated to create the new city of Saguenay in 2002.
**** The CD of Sept-Rivières—Caniapiscau (97) consists of the RCMs of Sept-Rivières (971) and Caniapiscau (972).
**** The CD of Minganie–Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent (98) consists of the RCMs of Minganie (981) and Le Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent (982). The latter superseded Basse-Côte-Nord in 2010; Basse-Côte-Nord itself was part of Minganie until 2002.
**** The CD of Nord-du-Québec (99) is coextensive with the administrative region of Nord-du-Québec and consists of the TEs of Jamésie (991), Kativik (992) and Eeyou Istchee (993).
In almost all such cases, the division in question was formerly a single unit of the standard type, which was divided into multiple units by its province after the 2001 Canadian census.

== Census consolidated subdivisions ==
A census consolidated subdivision is a geographic unit between census division and census subdivision. It is a combination of adjacent census subdivisions typically consisting of larger, more rural census subdivisions and smaller, more densely populated census subdivisions.

== Census subdivisions ==
Census subdivisions generally correspond to the municipalities of Canada, as determined by provincial and territorial legislation. They can also correspond to area which are deemed to be equivalents to municipalities for statistical reporting purposes, such as Indian reserves, Indian settlements, and unorganized territories where municipal level government may not exist. Statistics Canada has created census subdivisions in cooperation with the provinces of British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia as equivalents for municipalities. The Indian reserve and Indian settlement census subdivisions are determined according to criteria established by Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada.

== Dissemination areas ==
Dissemination areas are the smallest standard geographic unit in Canada and cover the entire country. As small areas, they comprise one or more dissemination blocks and have a population between 400 and 700 people.

== Specially-defined geographic units ==

=== Census metropolitan areas ===
: &quot;See template below for links to census metropolitan areas by size.&quot;
A &quot;census metropolitan area&quot; (CMA) is a grouping of census subdivisions comprising a large urban area (the &quot;urban core&quot;) and those surrounding &quot;urban fringes&quot; with which it is closely integrated. To become a CMA, an area must register an urban core population of at least 100,000 at the previous census. CMA status is retained even if this core population later drops below 100,000.

CMAs may cross census division and provincial boundaries, although the Ottawa-Gatineau metropolitan area in Ontario and Quebec is the only one that currently crosses a provincial border.

The methodology used by Statistics Canada does not allow for CMA-CMA mergers into larger statistical areas; consequently, there is no Canadian equivalent to the combined statistical areas of the United States. Statistics Canada has stated that Toronto, Oshawa and Hamilton could be merged into a single CSA were such an approach utilized. Statistics Canada has described the Greater Golden Horseshoe as the country&#x27;s largest urban area.

=== Census agglomerations ===

A &quot;census agglomeration&quot; (CA) is a smaller version of a CMA in which the urban core population at the previous census was greater than 10,000 but less than 100,000. If the population of an urban core is less than 50,000, it is the starting point for the construction of a &#x27;census agglomeration&#x27;.

=== Census tracts ===
CMAs and CAs with a population greater than 50,000 are subdivided into census tracts which have populations ranging from 2,500 to 8,000.

=== Population centres ===

A population centre (PC), formerly known as an urban area (UA), is any grouping of contiguous dissemination areas that has a minimum population of 1,000 and an average population density of 400 persons per square kilometre or greater. For the 2011 census, urban area was renamed &quot;population centre&quot;. In 2011, Statistics Canada identified 942 population centres in Canada. Some population centres cross municipal boundaries and not all municipalities contain a population centre while others have more than one.

The population centre level of geography is further divided into the following three groupings based on population:

*&quot;small population centre&quot; – 1,000 to 29,999
*&quot;medium population centre&quot; – 30,000 to 99,999
*&quot;large urban population centre&quot; – 100,000 and greater

=== Designated places ===

A &quot;designated place&quot; (DPL) is usually a small community that does not meet the criteria used to define incorporated municipalities or urban areas (areas with a population of at least 1,000 and no fewer than 400 persons per square kilometre), but for which Statistics Canada or a provincial government has requested that similar demographic data be compiled.

=== Localities === 
A &quot;locality&quot; (LOC) is a historical named location or place. The named location may be a former census subdivision, a former urban area, or a former designated place. It may also refer to neighbourhoods, post offices, communities and unincorporated places among other entities.

=== Electoral districts ===

Statistics Canada also aggregates data by federal electoral districts, one purpose for which is the redrawing of district boundaries every ten years. Federal electoral districts are numerically indexed; each district receives a unique five-digit code, with the first two digits being the Standard Geographical Classification code for the province or territory in which the district is located.

<doc id="605674" wikidata="Q863493" url="?curid=605674" title="Bin Laden family">
<text>The bin Laden family (), also spelled bin Ladin, is a wealthy Hadhrami family intimately connected with the innermost circles of the Saudi royal family. It is the namesake and controlling shareholder of the Saudi Binladin Group, a multinational construction firm. Following the September 11 attacks, the family became the subject of media attention and scrutiny due to the activities of Osama bin Laden, the former head of al-Qaeda, even though they publicly disowned him in 1994.

==Beginnings==
The family traces its origins to Awad bin Laden from the village of al-Rubat, in the Wadi Doan of the Tarim Valley, Hadramout governorate, Yemen. Awad&#x27;s son was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden (1908-1967). Mohammed bin Laden was a native of the Hadhramaut region in eastern Yemen, and, like many other Hadharem, emigrated to Saudi Arabia prior to World War I. He set up a construction company and came to Abdul Aziz ibn Saud&#x27;s attention through construction projects, later being awarded contracts for major renovations in Mecca. He made his initial fortune from exclusive rights to construct all mosques and other religious buildings not only in Saudi Arabia, but as far as Ibn Saud&#x27;s influence reached. Until his death, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden had exclusive control over restorations at the Jami Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem. Soon, the bin Laden corporate network extended far beyond just construction sites.

Mohammed&#x27;s special intimacy with the monarchy was inherited by the younger bin Laden generation. Mohammed&#x27;s sons attended Victoria College, Alexandria, Egypt. Their schoolmates included King Hussein of Jordan, Zaid Al Rifai, the Kashoggi brothers (whose father was one of the king&#x27;s physicians), Kamal Adham (who ran the General Intelligence Directorate under King Faisal), present-day contractors Mohammed Al Attas, Fahd Shobokshi, Ghassan Sakr, and actor Omar Sharif.

When Mohammed bin Laden died in 1967, his son Salem bin Laden took over the family enterprises, until his own accidental death in 1988.

==Family members==
American and European intelligence officials estimate that all the relatives of the family may number as many as 600. In 1994, the bin Laden family disowned Osama bin Laden, and the Saudi government revoked his passport. The Saudi government also stripped Osama of his citizenship for publicly speaking out against the government for permitting U.S. troops to be based in Saudi Arabia in preparation for the 1991 Gulf War.

The groupings of the bin Laden family, based on the nationalities of the wives, include the most prominent &quot;Saudi group&quot;, a &quot;Syrian group&quot;, a &quot;Lebanese group,&quot; and an &quot;Egyptian group&quot;. The Egyptian group employs 40,000 people, most likely the country&#x27;s largest private foreign investor. Osama bin Laden was born the only son of Muhammed bin Laden&#x27;s tenth wife, Hamida al-Attas, who was of Syrian origin, making Osama a member of the Syrian group.

===First generation===
* Muhammed bin Awad bin Laden (1908–1967) was the family patriarch and founder; before World War I, Muhammed, originally poor and uneducated, emigrated from Hadhramaut, on the south coast of Yemen, to the Red Sea port of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he began to work as a porter. Starting his own business in 1930, Muhammed built his fortune as a building contractor for the Saudi royal family during the 1950s. Married 22 times, with 54 children, his 17th child was Osama bin Laden, who was the son of Hamida al-Attas (born in Syria), Muhammed’s tenth wife. The couple divorced soon after Osama was born, and Hamida was given in marriage to one of the executives of Muhammed&#x27;s company around 1958. In 1967, Muhammed was killed in an airplane crash in Saudi Arabia when his pilot misjudged a landing.
* Muhammad al-Attas is Osama&#x27;s stepfather in whose household Osama was raised at Jeddah, and worked at the bin Laden company. The couple had four children in addition to Osama: three boys and a girl, Fatima Mohammed al-Attas.
*Abdallah bin Laden is the brother of Mohammed and the uncle of Osama; headed the Saudi Binladin Group (SBG); died in Medina, March 21, 2002, at age 75. He also had over 60 children and was married 6 times.

===Second generation===
* Salem bin Laden (1946–1988) attended Millfield, the English boarding school. He took over the family empire in 1967 upon the death of his father; also an amateur rock guitarist in the 1970s. He married an English art student, Caroline Carey, whose half-brother, Ambrose, is the son of the Marquess of Queensberry. Salem died outside San Antonio, Texas in 1988, when an experimental ultralight plane that he was flying got tangled in power lines.
* Tarek bin Laden (born 1947); once called &quot;the personification of the dichotomy (conservatism and change) of Saudi Arabia&quot;.
* Bakr bin Laden (born 1946) succeeded Salem as the chairman of the Saudi Binladin Group; major power broker in Jeddah.
* Hassan bin Laden, senior vice president of the SBG.
* Yehia bin Laden, also active in the SBG; in 2001, owned 16 percent of Cambridge, MA-based Hybridon, Inc.
* Mahrous bin Laden, implicated in the Grand Mosque Seizure carried out by dissidents against the Saudi ruling family at the Masjid al-Haram in Makkah on November 20, 1979. This event shook the Muslim world with the ensuing violence and the killing of hundreds at the holiest of Islamic sites. Trucks owned by the family were reported to have been used to smuggle arms into the tightly controlled city. The bin Laden connection was through the son of a Sultan of Yemen who had been radicalized by Syrian members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Mahrous was arrested for a time, but was not beheaded by the Saudi government alongside 63 others who were, with their public executions broadcast live on Saudi television. Later exonerated, he joined the family business and became manager of the Medina branch of the bin Laden enterprises and a member of the board.
* Osama bin Laden (born 1957 in Saudi Arabia, died May 2, 2011, in Pakistan) was a terrorist who co-founded the terrorism group Al-Qaeda, which was responsible for the attacks such as the 1998 United States embassy bombings, the 2002 Bali bombings, and most infamously, the September 11 attacks. His death was announced on May 2, 2011. He was one of the FBI&#x27;s Most Wanted Terrorists.
* Najwa Ghanem (born 1959), became the first wife of Osama in 1974. A first cousin, she was his mother&#x27;s niece. She co-authored &quot;Growing Up bin Laden&quot; with her son Omar.
* Shaikha bint Laden (born 1960), half-sister of Osama, married Mohammed Jamal Khalifa. He was the founder of Benevolence International Foundation, in the Philippines in 1988. During this period, Khalifa is believed to have received large donations of cash from outside the country, some of which, intelligence officials suspect, may have been funneled to him by Al-Qaeda. He also ran the International Relations and Information Centre, by which embezzled money was funneled to Ramzi Yousef. In 1993, his business cards were found in the Jersey City, New Jersey apartment that Yousef stayed in while he was involved with the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing plot. Khalifa was first arrested on December 14, 1994, in Mountain View, California, placed in solitary confinement, and the contents of his luggage were logged and edited. In 1995, Khalifa was arrested in San Francisco on charges of violating United States immigration laws. He was detained while the Justice Department tried but failed to gather enough information to charge him in connection with suspected terrorist activities. Eventually, he was deported on May 5, 1995, to Jordan, which had an outstanding warrant for him on charges stemming from the bombing of movie theaters in Amman in 1994, for which he had been under a possible death sentence, convicted in absentia. His conviction was later overturned in a new trial, which resulted in an acquittal. In 1996, Khalifa returned to Saudi Arabia, where he was again arrested after 9/11, but later released. He lived in Saudi Arabia and was assassinated in 2007 in Madagascar.
* Yeslam bin Ladin (born 1950) studied in the 1970s at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles; settled in Switzerland; became a Swiss citizen in 2001; Geneva-based head of the family&#x27;s European holding company, the Saudi Investment Company; was scrutinized by Swiss and American investigators because of a financial stake he has in a Swiss aviation firm; he has claimed to not have had contact with Osama since 1981
* Abdullah bin Laden (born 1965); a graduate of Harvard Law School, Abdullah lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts on 9/11, and was the only bin Laden relative to remain in the United States, staying in Boston for almost a month following the attacks.
* Shafig bin Laden, the half-brother of Osama, was a guest of honour at the Carlyle Group&#x27;s Washington conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel on September 11, 2001, and was among the 13 members of the family to leave the United States on September 19, 2001, aboard flight N521DB.

===Third generation===
* Wafah Dufour (born 1975), daughter of Yeslam bin Laden, is an American model and aspiring singer-songwriter. She spent the early part of her life in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Dufour, her little sisters Najia (1979) and Noor (1987), her mother (1954) and her father (1950) then moved to Geneva, Switzerland. In 1988, her parents separated. She earned a law diploma at Geneva Law School (Switzerland) and later a master&#x27;s degree from Columbia Law School in the United States. She lived in Manhattan until around the time of the September 11, 2001 attacks, but was staying in Geneva for a summer holiday at the time of the attacks.
* Abdullah Osama bin Laden (born 1976), son of Osama and Najwa. He is reportedly residing in Saudi Arabia, and runs his own firm, called Fame Advertising, in Jeddah; he is closely watched by the Saudi government, which has restricted his travel from the kingdom since 1996; reportedly, he has never disowned his father.
*Abdul Rahman bin Laden (born 1979), the second son of Osama and Najwa. As a child he was born with hydrocephalus, and his father took him to the United Kingdom for medical treatment. However, he refused to allow British surgeons to operate on the boy and tried to treat him himself using a folk remedy of honey. He ended up having an intellectual disability and autism. As an adult he moved to Syria with his mother in 2011. 
* Saad bin Laden (1979–2009) son of Osama and Najwa; Saad accompanied Osama on his exile to Sudan from 1991 to 1996, and then to Afghanistan. He was believed to be married to a woman from Yemen. Saad reportedly arrived in Iran in 2002 from Afghanistan, with a fake Iranian passport using the name Saad Mahmoudian. The customs officer immediately recognized that the passport was fake, and searched and questioned Saad briefly. He notified airport security but did not notify the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran (which is also responsible for identifying detained people at airports) as he was supposed to. As a result, the officer found nothing suspicious about his entrance and permitted him to leave Tehran. He was believed to have been heavily responsible for the bombing of a Tunisian synagogue on April 11, 2002. He was then implicated in the May 12, 2003, suicide bombing in Riyadh, and the Morocco bombing four days later. He was put under house arrest by the Iran government, but later escaped by January 2009 and fled to Pakistan. Saad was later killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2009. Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri confirmed Saad&#x27;s death in a videotape three years later.
* Omar bin Laden (born 1981) son of Osama and Najwa; Omar accompanied Osama on his exile to Sudan from 1991 to 1996, and then to Afghanistan. He returned to Saudi Arabia after an apparent falling-out with his father over Omar&#x27;s disagreement with violence. For a while, Omar ran his own company in Jeddah as a contractor. Omar has one son, Ahmed, by his ex-wife, whom he had divorced 3 times by 2006. In September 2006, he married Zaina and they are now said to be living in a secret location in Qatar. He is now reported to be living in Normandie, France, with his wife.

* Hamza bin Laden (1989–2017/2019), also the son of Osama, was groomed to be Osama&#x27;s heir following Saad&#x27;s death. On February 28, 2019, the U.S. State Department offered a reward of up to $1 million for information on Hamza bin Laden&#x27;s whereabouts. The announcement described Hamza bin Laden as a &quot;key leader&quot; of Al-Qaeda who had released audio and video messages on the internet calling for attacks on the U.S. and its western allies to avenge his father&#x27;s killing. On July 31, 2019, it was reported that Hamza bin Laden was believed to have been killed in the first two years of the first Trump administration, which began on January 20, 2017. On September 14, 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that Hamza bin Laden was killed in a U.S. counter-terrorism operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region. Other details were not disclosed.

==Bin Laden flights==
Around 13 members of the Bin Laden family, alongside their associates and bodyguards, flew out of the United States on a chartered flight with Ryan International Airlines (Ryan International Flight 441), eight days after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to a passenger manifest released on July 21, 2004. The passenger list was obtained and released by Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), who acquired it from officials at Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport. None of the flights, domestic or international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of September 13 and the 9/11 Commission found &quot;no evidence of a political intervention&quot;.

Among the passengers with the bin Laden surname were Omar Awad bin Laden, who had lived with Osama&#x27;s nephew Abdallah Awad bin Laden, who was involved in forming the U.S. branch of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth in Alexandria, and Shafig bin Laden, a half brother of Osama&#x27;s who was reportedly attending the annual investor conference of the Carlyle Group. Also on board was Akberali Moawalla, an official with the investment company run by Yeslam bin Ladin, another of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s half brothers. Records show that a passenger, Kholoud Kurdi, lived in Northern Virginia with a bin Laden relative.

The bin Laden flights received fresh publicity when they were discussed in Michael Moore&#x27;s controversial documentary &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.

The 9/11 Commission found that the &quot;FBI conducted a satisfactory screening of Saudi nationals who left the United States on charter flights. The Saudi government was advised of and agreed to the FBI&#x27;s requirements that passengers be identified and checked against various databases before the flights departed. The Federal Aviation Administration representative working in the FBI operations center made sure that the FBI was aware of the flights of Saudi nationals and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart.&quot;

Produced by David Weisbart, the film was directed by Gordon Douglas, based on an original story by George Worthing Yates that was developed into a screenplay by Ted Sherdeman, with adaptation by Russell Hughes.

&quot;Them!&quot; is one of the first of the 1950s &quot;nuclear monster&quot; movies, and the first with big bugs
as the threat. A nest of gigantic irradiated ants is discovered in the New Mexico desert; they quickly become a national threat when it is discovered that two young queens and their consorts have escaped to establish new nests. The national search that follows culminates in a battle with the last surviving colony in the concrete spillways and storm drain system of Los Angeles.
==Plot==
In 1954, New Mexico State Police Sgt. Ben Peterson and his partner, Ed Blackburn, discover a little girl wandering the desert in a catatonic state near Alamogordo. Shortly after they discover a ravaged travel trailer with its owners missing. They summon an ambulance for the girl then search for clues indicating what may have happened.

Later that night at a rural general store the officers find it destroyed in the same way the trailer was and its mutilated owner dead, killed fending off some sort of vicious attack. In each case no money had been taken. Peterson leaves Blackburn behind to secure the crime scene. Upon hearing a strange, pulsating sound outside, Blackburn goes to investigate and disappears.

FBI Agent Robert Graham arrives to investigate. Shortly after myrmecologist Phd’s Harold Medford and his daughter Pat are sent by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to lend assistance. On an educated hunch, Medford exposes the little girl to formic acid fumes, characteristic of ants. The odor releases her from her catatonia, leaving her shrieking in panic, &quot;Them! Them!&quot;

Peterson accompanies Graham and the Medfords to where the girl was first discovered. There Pat is accosted by a giant foraging ant. Following Medford&#x27;s orders, Peterson and Graham shoot off the ant&#x27;s antennae, to blind it, then kill it with a Thompson submachine gun. Medford theorizes that the giant ants mutated by radiation from the first atomic bomb test near Alamogordo, and have turned carnivorous from lack of a suitable food supply in the desert.

A helicopter search ensues, and a cave-sized ant nest is found. Cyanide gas bombs are tossed inside before Graham, Peterson, and Pat check for survivors. Inside, the trio are attacked by surviving guard ants, which they dispatch with flamethrower and Thompson before Pat finds evidence that two queens have hatched and escaped to establish new colonies. With the possibility that each could grow to thousands of ants apiece and spawn thousands more nests, Dr. Medford announces that mankind may become extinct within a year if the new winged queens aren’t found and eradicated.

A worldwide search is begun. One queen and its offspring are discovered aboard a freighter in mid-ocean out of Acapulco, which savagely attacked its crew. A handful of crewmen are rescued from the water and the freighter is sunk by U.S. naval gunfire.

Graham and Pat then travel to Brownsville, Texas, to interrogate a civilian pilot, committed to a mental hospital after claiming he was forced down by UFOs shaped like giant ants. A later report sends the investigators west to a Los Angeles hospital, where a chronic alcoholic claims he has seen giant ants in the city’s storm drain system. The mutilated body of a man is shortly found nearby, but his two young sons remain missing.

Martial law is declared and a curfew imposed. With help from Graham, the Medfords, and the armed forces, Peterson searches inside the cavernous drain network for the two boys. He finds them trapped by the ants near their nest. He calls for reinforcements and lifts the boys to safety, just before being attacked and killed by a giant ant. Graham arrives with backup, and they find the remaining queen and her hatchlings. The Medfords confirm that no new queens have gotten away and sanction their destruction. The senior Dr. Medford muses on the possible consequences of the decade of atomic tests already carried out since the firing of the Trinity atomic bomb.

===Cast notes===
*Leonard Nimoy has a small, uncredited part as a U.S. Army staff sergeant in the communications room.
*Other actors who appear in small parts include John Beradino, Willis Bouchey, Booth Colman, Richard Deacon, Lawrence Dobkin, Ann Doran, William Schallert, Douglas Spencer, Dub Taylor, Dorothy Green, Harry Wilson, Jan Merlin, and Walter Coy.
*When casting his planned Davy Crockett episode of the &quot;Disneyland&quot; television series, Walt Disney viewed the film to see James Arness, who had been recommended for the role. Disney, however, was more impressed by a scene with Fess Parker as an inmate in the mental ward of the Texas hospital. Watching Parker&#x27;s performance, Disney realized he had found his Davy Crockett. John Wayne saw the film and, impressed with Arness&#x27; performance, recommended him for the role of Marshal Matt Dillon in the new &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; TV series, a role that Arness went on to play from 1955 to 1975.

==Production==

When &quot;Them!&quot; began production in the fall of 1953, it was originally conceived to be in 3D and Warner Color. During pre-production, test shots in color and 3D were made. A few color tests of the large-scale ant models were also made, but when it was time to shoot the 3D test, Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;All Media&quot; 3D camera rig malfunctioned and no footage could be filmed. The next day a memo was sent out that the color and 3D aspects of the production were to be scrapped; widescreen black-and-white would now be the film&#x27;s presentation format. Warner Bros. hoped to emulate the &quot;effective shock treatment&quot; effect of its previous science fiction thriller &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;; ultimately, however, the film was never made in widescreen. Because of the preparation of certain scenes, many of the camera set-ups for 3D remain in the film, like the opening titles and the flamethrowers shots aimed directly at the camera.

Although Warner Bros. was dissatisfied with the color results, the film&#x27;s titles were printed in vivid red and blue against a black-and-white background to give the film&#x27;s opening a dramatic &quot;punch&quot;. This effect was achieved by an Eastman Color section spliced into each release print. The 1985 VHS tape release, the subsequent LaserDisc and later DVD release have retained this black-and-white-with-two-color title effect.

The entrance to the ants&#x27; final nest was filmed along the concrete spillways of the Los Angeles River, between the First and Seventh Street Bridges, east of downtown. The depiction of the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico is actually the Mojave Desert near Palmdale, California. Mercy Hospital was a real institution and is now Brownsville Medical Center.

James Whitmore wore &quot;lifts&quot; in his shoes to compensate for the height difference between himself and James Arness. Whitmore also employed bits of &quot;business&quot; (hand gestures and motions) during scenes in which he appeared to draw more attention to his character when not speaking.

The Wilhelm scream, created three years earlier for the film &quot;Distant Drums&quot;, is used during the action sequences: when a sailor aboard the freighter is grabbed by an ant, when James Whitmore&#x27;s character is caught in an ant&#x27;s mandibles, and when an overhead wooden beam falls on a soldier in the Los Angeles storm drain sequence.

The giant ants, painted a purplish-green color, were constructed and operated by unseen technicians supervised by Ralph Ayers. During the climactic battle sequence in the Los Angeles sewers, there is a brief shot of one ant moving in the foreground with its side removed, revealing its mechanical interior. This filming error was obscured on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film.

The film poster shows a gigantic ant with menacing cat-like eyes rather than the normal compound eyes of an ant.

The stridulations (the sounds the giant ants emit on the soundtrack) were the calls of bird-voiced tree frogs mixed together with the calls of a wood thrush, hooded warbler, and red-bellied woodpecker. These were recorded at Indian Island, Georgia, on April 11, 1947, by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.

==Reception==
===Box office===

&quot;Them!&quot; was released in June 1954, and by the end of that year had accrued $2.2 million (US) in distributors&#x27; domestic (U.S. and Canada) rentals, making it the year&#x27;s 51st biggest earner.

===Reviews===
A. H. Weiler&#x27;s review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted &quot;... from the moment James Whitmore, playing a New Mexico state trooper, discovers a six-year-old moppet wandering around the desert in a state of shock, to the time when the cause of that mental trauma is traced and destroyed, &quot;Them!&quot; is taut science fiction&quot;.

The reviewer in &quot;Variety&quot; stated it was a &quot;top-notch science fiction shocker. It has a well-plotted story, expertly directed and acted in a matter-of-fact style to rate a chiller payoff and thoroughly satisfy the fans of hackle-raising melodrama&quot;.

John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;If you&#x27;re willing to let your imagination off its leash, you may have a fairly good time at &#x27;Them!&#x27;&quot;

The contemporary &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; stated that despite the science fiction film genre being new it had developed several sub-divisions including &quot;the other-worldly, the primeval-monstrous, the neo-monstrous, the planetary-visitant, etc.&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Them!&quot; is a &quot;well-built example of the neo-monstrous&quot;, &quot;less absurdly sensational than most&quot; Discussing the ant monsters in the film, the review referred to them as &quot;reasonably horrible--they do not entirely avoid the impression of mock-up that is almost inevitable when over-lifesize creatures have to be constructed and moved&quot; while noting that they were &quot;considerably more conceivable than those prehistoric remnants that have recently been emerging from bog and iceberg&quot;. The review commented on the cast as &quot;like most science-fiction, [the film] is on the whole serviceably rather than excitingly cast&quot; and the crew was noted, stating the direction was &quot;smoothly machined&quot; and the film has &quot;decent writing&quot; though &quot;more short cuts might have been [taken]&quot;, finding that the start of the film was too slow.

Since its original release, &quot;Them!&quot; has become generally regarded as one of the best science fiction films of the 1950s. Bill Warren described it as &quot; ... tight, fast-paced and credible ... [T]he picture is suspenseful&quot;. Phil Hardy&#x27;s &quot;The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Science Fiction&quot; noted, &quot;Directed by [Gordon] Douglas in semi-documentary fashion, &quot;Them!&quot; is one of the best American science fiction films of the fifties&quot;. Danny Peary believed the film &quot;Ranks with &quot;The Thing&quot; and &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; as the best of the countless &#x27;50s science fiction films&quot;. In the &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot;, David Pirie wrote, &quot;By far the best of the 50s cycle of &#x27;creature features&#x27; ... retains a good part of its power today&quot;. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating as of September 2021, with an average rating of 7.6/10, based on 57 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;One of the best creature features of the early atomic age, &quot;Them!&quot; features effectively menacing special effects and avoids the self-parody that would taint later monster movies&quot;.

&quot;Them!&quot; was nominated for an Oscar for its special effects (but the award went to &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;) and won a Golden Reel Award for best sound editing.

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Them!&quot; heavily inspired the 1956 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film &quot;Rodan&quot;.
*Van Morrison&#x27;s band Them was named after this film though the band member that came up with the name was not Van Morrison but Eric Wrixon.
*The video game series &quot;It Came from the Desert&quot; was inspired by &quot;Them!&quot;
*&quot;Fallout 3&quot;, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic irradiated wasteland, has a side-quest involving giant mutated fire ants titled &quot;Those!&quot; in homage to the film.
*The scene where Pat is attacked by the foraging ant appears as a replay in the 2018 Marvel film &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot;.

<text>(Henrik) Kurt Carlsen (20 February 1914 – 7 October 1989) was a Danish-born sea-captain who became world-famous in January 1952 when he stayed on his sinking freighter, the &quot;Flying Enterprise&quot;, for 13 days. It eventually sank less than from safe harbour at Falmouth, Cornwall in England, minutes after the Captain was forced to abandon ship. The endeavour was reported around the world, and Carlsen received a ticker-tape parade in New York City on January 17, 1952. A few months later Carlsen took command of the &quot;Flying Enterprise II&quot;, passing up lucrative offers from Hollywood.
It is now believed that the &quot;Flying Enterprise&quot; was hit not once but twice by a rogue wave thereby eventually sinking the freighter.

Carlsen became a seaman at age 14 and master of his first ship at 22, in the service of the Danish-American company American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines. He was an amateur radio operator with callsign W2ZXM.

Carlsen, and his ordeal aboard the &quot;Flying Enterprise&quot;, is the subject of the book &quot;Simple Courage: a True Story of Peril on the Sea&quot; by Frank Delaney.

Carlsen received the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Award, authorized by a special act of Congress. On January 10, 2012, the Captain Carlsen Park in Sewaren,(Woodbridge Township) NJ was rededicated to the heroic efforts of Captain Carlsen. A monument was installed at the park which was donated by Shipco Transport Inc. a New Jersey transportation services company. A contingent of Danish visitors were present along with the Captain Carlsen&#x27;s daughters.

<text>In photochemistry, photohydrogen is hydrogen produced with the help of artificial or natural light. This is how the leaf of a tree splits water molecules into protons (hydrogen ions), electrons (to make carbohydrates) and oxygen (released into the air as a waste product). Photohydrogen may also be produced by the photodissociation of water by ultraviolet light.

Photohydrogen is sometimes discussed in the context of obtaining renewable energy from sunlight, by using microscopic organisms such as bacteria or algae. These organisms create hydrogen with the help of hydrogenase enzymes which convert protons derived from the water splitting reaction into hydrogen gas which can then be collected and used as a biofuel.

<doc id="605698" wikidata="Q7101103" url="?curid=605698" title="Oregon Bottle Bill">
<text>The Oregon Bottle Bill is a container-deposit legislation enacted in the U.S. state of Oregon in 1971 that went into effect in October 1972. It was the first such legislation in the United States. It was amended in 2007 and 2011. It requires applicable beverages in applicable sizes in glass, plastic or metal cans or bottles sold in Oregon to be returnable with a minimum refund value. The refund value was initially 5 cents until April 1, 2017, when it increased to 10 cents. The Oregon Legislature has given the Oregon Liquor Control Commission the authority to administer and enforce the Bottle Bill. Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative (OBRC), a private cooperative owned by retailers and beverage distributors, administers the collection and transportation of returned containers and keeps all the unclaimed deposits. Materials from returned containers are sold by the OBRC and proceeds are handed out to beverage distributors. In 2022, the bottle bill was expanded to include canned wine, which will become eligible for redemption on July 1, 2025.

When passed in 1971, the bottle bill was viewed primarily as a litter control measure. In 1971, bottles made up about 40% of litter, 10.8% in 1973 and 6% in 1979. Oregon DEQ reports that the reduction is &quot;as a result of the law&quot; referring to the Bottle Bill. In a 2006 publication it was reported that states without similar bills recycle on average 33% of their containers. A 2016 study by Campbell, Benjamin, et al. found bottle deposit law only had a small impact of about 3% for clear glass and aluminum recycling rate when bottle deposit law coexists with municipal recycling program. The redemption rate in the 1980s was around 90%. Negative return experiences such as discomfort and inability to return due to retailers failing to keep machines in working order have led to the decline in redemption rate to about 65% by 2015. In 2015, more than 80% of Oregonians lived where curbside recycling is provided. In the same year, the Oregonian&#x27;s editorial board posited that the bottle deposit has become more redundant as curbside recycling became more common. State law requires retailers and redemption centers to pay the refund value to consumers presenting containers covered under the bottle bill. Beverage distributors charge the initial deposit on shipments of beverages to retailers, who in turn pass it onto customers, however, charging deposit to consumers is not required by state law. Beverage distributors retain all deposits not reclaimed by consumers. The 2022 statewide redemption rate for containers subject to deposit was 85.5%.

Starting in the early 2010s, OLCC approved redemption centers run by distributors; there were 16 of them by April 2017. Several redemption centers have been plagued with issues revolving around transients, crime and drug activities. Community objections to redemption center proposals have revolved around these issues.

Portland, Multnomah County and state officials have said drug addicts use bottle return to fund their fentanyl purchase.

== Covered beverages ==
The refund value has been 10 cents since April 1, 2017 and it applies to covered beverages in cans or bottles made from metal, glass or plastic.

=== 3 liters or less ===

# Water and flavored water
# Beer or other malt beverages
# carbonated soft drinks.
#kombucha
#hard seltzer

=== 4 oz to 1.5 liters ===
Any beverages other than the above in sizes 4 oz to 1.5 liters in metal, glass or plastic containers are subject to a 10 cent refund value. Some milk based products such as kefir, drinkable yogurt, milk-based smoothies and milk or plant-based milk with other ingredients that have been previously excluded were enrolled into the Oregon Bottle Bill in January 2020, but the OLCC reversed the decision on February 5, 2020.

==== exclusions to the refund value requirements ====

#distilled spirits (liquor). Canned cocktails are considered liquor.
#wine, including mead and hard cider over 8.5% ABV. 
#milk and plant based milk
#infant formula
#vinegar (except drinking vinegar)
#flavoring and condiments, including juices not normally drunk without mixing, like lemon and lime juice
#concentrates and syrup
#meal replacements

=== Senate Bill 1520 (canned wine) ===
2022 expansion to Oregon Bottle Bill added canned wine, which will carry a refund value starting on July 1, 2025.

== Deposit redemption ==
=== Bag drop off redemption ===
Bulk redemption of Oregon bottles by bag drop was introduced in 2010. In this redemption method, consumers create an account and fill designated bags with empty containers and drop off the filled bags to a participating location. They&#x27;re collected and taken to a processing center and refund value is credited to the consumer&#x27;s account after they have been counted. By February 2024, one in four households in Oregon had a bag account. The redemption operator OBRC is rated &quot;D&quot; by the Better Business Bureau as of March 2024 for having 71 complaints and 1 unanswered complaints. State audit reported that consumers have complained about accuracy of the counting process, but found the program generally works well. The audit identified an instance where the OBRC incorrectly counted against a usage quota and commented that they were unable to identify where discrepancy came from due to account only shows the current balance without revealing credit for each bag. 


=== Concerns around fraudulent conduct ===
==== Theft from curbside bins and receptacles ====
It is unlawful under Oregon Revised Statutes 459A.080 to remove recyclable containers set aside for collection by a city or county collection service without the permission of the owner or generator of the contents, which includes going through curbside bins for containers with deposit value. It is also unlawful to remove recyclable material from a container, box, vehicle, depot or other receptacle for the accumulation or storage of recyclable material without permission of the receptacle&#x27;s owner. Violation of ORS 459A.080 is a class A misdemeanor criminal offense per ORS 459.992(1)(d) In the Oregon Supreme Court case State v. Waterhouse, defendant, a scrapper, was found guilty of intentionally appropriating scrap metal having some value to himself.

===== Issues attributed to refundable container thefts =====

In December 2018, &quot;The Columbian&quot; reported neighbors in the Cascade Park neighborhood in Vancouver, Washington near the Oregon border have noticed thefts of cans and bottles as well as the curbside bins. A district manager for Waste Connections reported its subsidiary Columbia Resource Company that handles Clark County, Washington saw a 9% reduction in glass bottles returned after the deposit increased from 5 cents to 10 cents in Oregon in 2017. He attributes the likely cause to theft. Removal of contents from recycling bins or nearby them without the consent of the generator or the hauler is prohibited in Clark County. Waste Connections did not provide an exact number on thefts from recycling bins, but reported enough is removed and taken to Oregon to have a financial impact for Waste Connections which sells recyclable materials collected. &quot;The Columbian&quot; reported in June 2019 that reports of scavengers rummaging through recycling bins have increased in the past year. The newspaper reports scavengers target cans and bottles that have value across the Columbia river which undercuts the hauler as well as generating complaints from the public. Marty Smith, writing for the &quot;Willamette Week&quot; reports that community members in Vancouver started complaining about theft of cans and bottles from their recycling bins. To better track complaints related to recyclables scavenging, the Clark Regional Emergency Services Agency (CRESA), the police dispatch for Clark County is looking into a way of tracking scavenging complaints. In Washington state, scavenging is a crime of third degree theft. According to the city of Vancouver, scavenging is considered by law enforcement to be a gateway crime to other crimes such as illegal drugs and identity theft.

A video on the internet showing a woman dumping water into the sink at the BottleDrop redemption center in 2017 caused a community outrage and resulted in the woman being cited for theft of $40 worth of bottled water from Albertsons. Police commented that as she was seen cashing stolen goods, it could be a felony.

In a 2018 concession stand burglary at Douglas McKay High School in Salem, burglars emptied out about ten cases of 24-pack beverages into a trash can inside the concession stand and stole the empty containers. School staff believed the theft motive was converting the stolen containers into cash at the nearby OBRC BottleDrop redemption center on Lancaster Drive.

In September 2019, Recology, a waste hauler operating in Ashland told the &quot;Ashland Tidings&quot; that in addition to theft, its drivers were experiencing harassment by emboldened recyclables thieves that they had to improvise plans to deal with theft and harassment of drivers by thieves. Recology receives many calls from customers concerning people going through their bins. The company recommends people to not put out their redeemables, donating them to charities or redeeming them themselves to reduce this problem.

Oregon DEQ survey reports over half of 77 multi-family property managers interviewed identified the use of waste collection area by non-tenants, such as transients, a problem that cause issues such as contamination of recyclable materials. Oregon DEQ opined retrieval of returnable containers as the motivation for transients and other non-tenants to access the collection areas.

===== Redemption of previously redeemed containers =====
Jules Bailey, the chief stewardship officer for OBRC, told &quot;the Mail Tribune&quot; there have been instances of people attempting to redeem cans that have already been redeemed through a machine.

==== Fraudulent redemption of out-of-state containers ====
Redemption of out-of-state containers is considered a fraud and prohibited by the bottle bill. Retailers and redemption centers may refuse to accept containers when they have reasonable grounds to believe they were purchased outside of Oregon. Staff at some locations near the state border request receipts proving the containers being redeemed were purchased in Oregon. Fraudulent redemption has been a problem according to KATU news. As told to KATU reporter by a coop (OBRC) representative, the redemption center staff at Delta Park near the state boundary catches about 50 people per day from Washington. C-TRAN which operates public transit service that traverses between Vancouver, Washington and Portland have banned the carrying of empty beverage containers on their service for safety and sanitation reasons created by people who carry cans across the state line on their service to redeem them in Portland. In May 2019, Jules Bailey from OBRC said he did not know the magnitude of the problem, but said it is an issue with the return of Washington containers around the &quot;Columbia corridor&quot; and minimal issues with California or Idaho. Senate Bill 522 sponsored by senator Betsy Johnson from Scappoose fines those who bring out-of-state containers. The bill was passed and signed into law making fraudulent redemption a Class D violation going into effect January 2020. Johnson told KGW &quot;retail grocers in her district every day are overwhelmed with massive bottle returns from the Washington side of river, sometimes by the pickup load.&quot; During the public hearing, the store director for the St. Helens Safeway testified to the committee of seeing a dramatic increase in Washington residents returning containers and described that people arrive in Washington plate vehicles with cases of bottled water and emptying them out on the parking lot to prepare the bottles to return into bottle machines at the Safeway location he manages. Northwest Grocery Association&#x27;s president reported redemption rates at redemption centers near the Oregon state border have seen a sharp rise, sometimes over 100% following the deposit value increase in Oregon.

In the November 2020 State audit, OBRC reported the cost of cross-border fraud is &quot;upwards of $10 million&quot; however, auditors could not verify OBRC&#x27;s claim. In preparing the report, representatives from the Audits Division visited two BottleDrop redemption centers near the Washington border and they reported observing numerous people arriving in vehicles with Washington license plates or without any plates.

==== Bottle deposit motivated welfare fraud &quot;water dumping&quot; ====

&quot;Water dumping&quot; is a term dubbed by the United States Department of Agriculture referring to a commonly perpetrated welfare fraud by cash seeking welfare recipients purchasing bottled water so they can empty them out and redeem containers for the redemption value in cash. In September 2012, such scheme was not considered a fraud in Oregon. In February 2013, USDA expanded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program fraud definition to include water dumping. The USDA intends to place repeat &quot;water dumping&quot; offenders on the nationwide lifetime SNAP ban list. In August 2019, KTVZ shared a video recorded by a grocery store employee in La Pine of a man dumping contents of soda that had been purchased with Oregon Trail SNAP card. According to the statement provided to the reporter by the employee, it was a common occurrence. Oregon Department of Human Services told KTVZ that it is considered a fraud that may result in a termination of benefits and the state is cracking down on this fraud this year. Springfield police observed a man and woman emptying bottles in September 2019. When contacted, the woman admitted to police they were emptying water they had purchased on SNAP to cash the containers so they can use the money to purchase fuel. The woman was arrested on outstanding warrants and the police reported the water dumping incident to the Oregon Department of Human Services. &quot;KTVL&quot; reports a store manager they interviewed has seen people purchasing bottled water with SNAP, emptying them out and returning to the store to redeem the containers for cash.

=== Community concerns regarding beverage container redemption centers (BCRC) ===
In order to open a redemption center, it must be approved by OLCC. A site was proposed at southwest 17th Avenue and west Burnside Street in Portland in 2014. OLCC received about 200 comments, most of which were against the center. Stakeholders such as dozens of neighbors and businesses including Portland Timbers and Portland Thorns FC opposed the establishment of the beverage container redemption center. Many objections related to foresight of vagrants and crime related to transients with shopping carts with scavenged cans flocking to the new redemption center. A redemption center planned in Portland&#x27;s St. Johns neighborhood in 2024 was also met with objections from hundreds of community members. The city has since received over 650 emails voicing opposition to the redemption center. Redemption centers are associated with criminal activity.

==== Beaverton ====
A redemption center opened up in May, 2017 in Beaverton. KATU&#x27;s Andrew Reed reports neighbors report BottleDrop brought in people &quot;who routinely act suspicious and are causing problems&quot; in the neighborhood. A nearby veterinarian interviewed reports BottleDrop &quot;brought a wave of problems to his property&quot;. He reports one of his business&#x27; security camera was ripped off and had someone break into his practice&#x27; bathroom to use drugs. In addition, he reports shopping carts getting left on his property almost daily as well as finding bottles of urine; offering a list of issues of security, noise, odor, traffic, littering, drug paraphernalia and transients. A resident behind the redemption center reported seeing public urination and became suspicious of people he believes to be acting suspiciously near his home. The dean of students for Jesuit High School commented &quot;Our school is less safe now&quot; referring to the presence of OBRC&#x27;s BottleDrop redemption center. Supporters of the center were the Oregon Food Bank which participates in its fundraising program and two science teachers from Meadow Park Middle School, which is approximately four miles from the site.

==== Bend ====
In September 2017, KTVZ described that businesses near the Bend BottleDrop Center have &quot;noticed a difference in the neighborhood ever since the Bottle Drop moved in&quot;. The news reporter described businesses have seen transient encampments nearby and felt the BottleDrop attracts transients. In 2017, Bend police responded to 270 calls at the BottleDrop. In four months period leading up to when the story was written on July 16, 2018, two subjects were arrested for offensive littering and 11 were arrested for drug offenses at the BottleDrop property. Bend Police arrested 24 people in 4-months period leading up to July 12, 2018 around the BottleDrop for matters such as drug possession, stealing shopping carts from retailers and offensive littering. In April 2020, Bend Police again identified the area around Bend BottleDrop as a site of ongoing complaints about drug use, theft, littering, abandoned shopping carts and criminal mischief and conducted a focused enforcement operation resulting in several arrests.

==== Medford ====
In June 2018, Damian Mann of &quot;Mail Tribune&quot; reports nearby business owners say the OBRC&#x27;s redemption center has been a &quot; magnet for methamphetamine &quot;tweakers&quot; who cash in their bottles and head out to buy drugs and &quot;unsavory behavior&quot;. These Medford businesses also said they began noticing vagrancy, theft and vandalism ever since BottleDrop redemption center opened. In 2018, the owner of Southern Oregon Crane in Medford testified to the city council &quot;It’s like living right next to a crack house.&quot; in reference to the redemption center. The Medford redemption center opened in November 2014 and it was the 10th one to open in the state.

==== Portland Delta Park ====

On March 27, 2020, Delta Park BottleDrop&#x27;s landlord TMT Development issued a notice of default citing health and safety concerns. After a long line started to form outside the store, TMT stated BottleDrop had not been managing social distancing requirements relating to COVID-19 pandemic. The notice directed them to comply with 6 ft social distancing rule or face eviction. The same weekend, the police were called to the redemption center after a man made death threats. TMT Development&#x27;s CEO said nearby businesses have complained about BottleDrop&#x27;s patrons blocking their doors, standing too close together as well as violence, according to &quot;The Oregonian&quot;. In April, TMT development installed a fence around a grassy property after drug needles were found. TMT has also deployed armed guards to prevent people from queuing up in the parking lot or in front of other businesses. This area has been used by BottleDrop&#x27;s customers, but it is not part of the formal lease agreement. TMT&#x27;s president cites they needed to step in to prevent fights and drug dealing. The manager of a sporting goods store interviewed by Willamette Week said he&#x27;s seen drug deals and fights in front of the OBRC&#x27;s BottleDrop. The police responded to the Delta Park BottleDrop location 67 times in 2023. Complaints have been getting filed for years about litter and crime around this site.

== Retailer requirements ==
Retailers are required to refund deposit to consumer when they present containers as set forth by the bottle bill. The requirements are dependent on if the store is under 5,000 square foot; or greater than or equal to 5,000 square feet, distance from the redemption center, and the retailer&#x27;s participation in the program.

Reverse vending machines are optional. Retailers are required to accept containers all hours they are open for business whether or not they have a machine or if their machine is working and being busy is not an exception to this obligation. Retailers are required to accept crushed or damaged containers if the brand and Oregon 10c marking are visible and customers are entitled to ask for a hand count on containers with refund value rejected by the store&#x27;s machine.

=== Situations when returns can be refused ===
Retailers and redemption centers may refuse containers contaminated with anything other than ordinary dust, the original contents or water. Additionally, when staff have reasonable grounds to suspect the containers were not purchased in Oregon. Redemption centers use individuals arriving in a vehicle with Washington license plates as a reasonable ground to suspect they were purchased outside Oregon unless they can prove the beverages were purchased in Oregon. If there are reasonable such grounds, retailers may request a receipt. The OLCC says retailers should reject containers that have been flattened by a reverse vending machine as it is an indication that they have already been redeemed. OLCC describes cans that have already been through the machine are characterized by &quot;small square indentations or perforations and will be fairly symmetrically crushed&quot; and plastic bottles will have a crushed neck.

=== Over 5,000 square feet ===
Participating retailers over 5,000 square feet within two miles (zone 1) from a redemption center are not required to accept any container. If in zone 2 (up to miles from center), they are required to accept 24 per person, per day. Retailers outside of the zone are required to accept 144. Retailers within the zone that choose not to participate in the redemption center program are required to accept 350 containers per person per day.

=== Under 5,000 square feet ===
They&#x27;re required to accept 24 containers per person per day if they&#x27;re within either zone 1 or zone 2 of the redemption center.

Retailers under 5,000 square feet (small shop, convenience stores and like) outside the two zones are allowed to limit the quantity to 50 containers per person per day. They can also limit them to the brand and size they sell.

Within these limitations, retailers are required to accept containers all hours they&#x27;re open for business and it is unlawful for retailers to refuse containers unless:
Bottle return machines are provided for retailers&#x27; convenience. Even when machines are broken, retailers continue to have legal obligations to accept containers even if they have to hand count them.

== Redemption value flow ==
State law mandates a payment of redemption value upon presentation of container. Deposit initiator is not required and charging deposit to consumers is voluntary. Bottle deposit is generally initiated by distributors and charged on each transaction. Covered products sold within the State of Oregon must read &quot;OR 10c&quot; for compliance purposes. For redemption purposes, OBRC&#x27;s BottleDrop service will redeem all covered containers regardless of marking. Deposit that is not redeemed is kept by distributors such as Columbia Distributing and Maletis Beverages. &quot;Willamette Week&quot;&#x27;s Nigel Jaquiss was uncertain about the environmental benefits but opined &quot;the increase will create a big payday for the companies that distribute beer and soda.&quot; The Oregon legislature has given the OLCC the authority to enforce and administer the Bottle Bill.

In 2016, OLCC refused to release the monetary value of the deposit kept by distributors when &quot;Willamette Week&quot; asked for it. OLCC responded &quot;we are forbidden from releasing any numbers other than a percentage&quot;. The newspaper appealed to the Oregon Department of Justice which ordered the numbers be released as a matter of public record in September 2016. The newspaper said that the beverage industry lobbyist Paul Romain said the distributor wanted the individual companies numbers private. The data showed that distributors were keeping about $30 million annually. OBRC had 450 employees and a budget of $44 million for 2019. During the same year, $29 million of the budget was paid for with unredeemed bottles. Remaining were paid by cash contributions from grocers and distributors.

== Returned material process ==
OBRC, a group of deposit initiating distributors administers the collection and transportation of deposit bearing containers. Containers that are recycled through curbside recycling are not counted towards redemption rate statistics and waste haulers do not receive the redemption value. The value of scrap materials sold is not included in the OBRC&#x27;s operating budget. OBRC distributes the revenue from selling recyclable materials to distributors that form the cooperative membership. The disbursement amount to individual cooperative member is determined based on proportion of containers and materials returned that are attributed to each member. OBRC does not release these figures to OLCC, however the state auditor&#x27;s report estimated the OBRC disbursed $19.08 million in 2018 and $17.05 million in 2019 to its beverage distributor members from selling scrap materials from returned containers and most of value comes from aluminum. The OBRC reports an annual volume of: of aluminum, of PET, and of glass. In 2017, OBRC&#x27;s expenses were $34 million. $9 million of which was paid by distributors and $25 million was paid by the unredeemed deposit.

The green bags used for BottleDrop drop off is landfilled after the contents are processed. All glass bottles that are returned for redemption under the Oregon Bottle Bill are processed at Owens-Brockway plant located in the Cully neighborhood in Portland. This plant was fined $1 million by the Oregon DEQ for environmental violations in June 2021.

== History ==
Oregon&#x27;s 1971 &quot;Beverage Container Act&quot; (ORS 459A.700 to 459A.740) was the first such legislation passed in the United States. It went into effect on October 1, 1972.

=== 1970s ===
Before the formal 1971 Oregon Bottle Bill, Oregon had already set up a less formal bottle return system that most stores and some of the public cooperated with. Inspired by the early Vermont bottle return system before it was repealed, Oregon&#x27;s limited system paid 1 cent for beer bottles and cans and 3 cents for soda bottles and cans. It was started in the mid-1950s and lasted through the rest of the 50s, throughout the 1960s and into the early 70s until the more formal and expanded Bottle Bill was enacted. The emphasis was on bottles, as bottles were washed and re-used for fresh product sold to the public before health laws were enacted that stopped the re-wash system. And because of the low payout for the return of bottles and cans, and in spite of various anti-litter PSA advertising campaigns on Oregon television, only a relatively small percentage of Oregonians participated in the return of bottles and cans. As a result, many bottles and cans still littered Oregon&#x27;s highways and scenic areas throughout this entire early bottle-can recycling period.

Richard Chambers, a logging equipment salesman, collected litter during his hiking, climbing, and kayaking throughout the state. In 1968, he called Oregon State Representative Paul Hanneman, whom Chambers knew well, after he was inspired by a small newspaper article about British Columbia wanting to ban non-refundable bottles and cans. Chambers wanted a deposit on bottles and cans to encourage people to return them to the store.

Chambers began a letter-writing campaign, using non-ordinary stationery and stamps to draw the attention of his intended audience. Oregon House Bill 1157 was introduced and assigned to the House State and Federal Affairs Committee. Chambers brought in people to testify for the bill, including a river guide to testify about the amount of beverage package litter in the water, and a farmer who lost four cows because of ingestion of glass and metal shards from beverage containers. Beverage container materials companies and bottling companies fought the bill. Hanneman offered the compromise of not banning non-returnables but instead requiring a five-cent deposit as an incentive for return. By a 5 to 4 vote, the bill was sent to the House floor, where it fell 3 votes short of passage, with 27 of 60 members voting for it. Governor Tom McCall had already offered his support for the bill, so Hanneman asked McCall to help sway the House&#x27;s vote in favor of passage. McCall refused, advising that he did not want a Bottle Bill in that legislative session. McCall planned to endorse the anti-littering campaign espoused by the Keep America Beautiful non-profit in 1970 and wait until 1971 to support the Bottle Bill. It has been written that this delay was intentional on McCall&#x27;s part to make the bill his. After its defeat, Chambers continued his letter writing campaign.

After McCall refused to back the Bottle Bill in 1969, he sponsored the formation of non-profit SOLV—Stop Oregon Litter and Vandalism. In 1971, it was reported that 75% of SOLV&#x27;s budget was derived from organizations opposing the bottle bill. SOLV also received state funds.

In 1970, McCall initiated his own campaign for the Bottle Bill. Bill Chambers and Don Waggoner (1935–2016) worked to get the bill approved. Among opponents of the bill were beverage companies who feared financial strains with the processing of returns.

The new bill, House Bill 1036, banned non-returnables and placed a five-cent deposit on bottles and cans containing beer, malt beverage, mineral and soda waters and carbonated soft drinks. The law went into effect on October 1, 1972. The law mandated beer, malt liquor and carbonated soft drinks in refillable containers that were certified for use by multiple manufacturers to have a minimum of 2 cent per container deposit. Those beverages in other types of containers were required to have a 5 cent refund value.

==== The first 6 months into the bottle bill ====
Prior to the Bottle Bill becoming enacted, about 51% of soft drinks were sold in refillable glass bottles, 41% in cans and 8% in non-refillable glass bottles. In December 1971, the OLCC estimated about 35% of beer sold in Oregon were sold in cans. In December 1972, 99.5% of beer was sold in bottles with the remainder being sold in cans.

In March 1973, all soft drinks sold in Oregon were in refillable bottles, except for less than 1% that were sold in cans.

In March 1973 prices, beer cited as an example cost $1.58 for a six pack including 30 cent deposit in non-refillable containers and $1.17 for 6 in refillable bottles which included a 12 cent deposit.

In 1974, the state reported that litter of beverage containers had been by reduced by 83 percent.

=== 1990s to present ===
In 1996, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have extended the bottle bill. In 2005, Republican Party Representative Vicki Berger (daughter of Chambers) introduced another bill to extend the bottle bill, but it was defeated in the Senate.

On June 7, 2007, Governor Ted Kulongoski signed Senate Bill 707 into law, which added water bottles to the refund law. The law went into effect January 1, 2009. Of the nine states that had bottle bill laws at that time, only Maine, California, and Hawaii included water bottles.

The 2007 legislature also created a task force, charged with making recommendations for further updating of the Bottle Bill to the 2009 legislature. Updates under consideration in the late 2000s included adding products like wine and juice bottles, and increasing the refund amount from 5 cents.

The Container Recycling Institute estimates that 125 million disposable water bottles were sold in Oregon in 2005, more than the number of soft drink bottles, and the recycling rate for water bottles was 32 percent, compared with 82 percent for beer and soft drink bottles. Container Recycling Institute is a research and advocacy group in support of the bottle bill.

OLCC approved redemption centers run by distributors on an experimental basis in early 2010. Two locations were opened, one in Wood Village and another in Oregon City. By April 2017, there were 16 redemption centers. The first redemption center intended to replace redemption at retail stores opened in Wood Village in September 2010 and it included bag drop off service as well. For decades, bottle returns were done exclusively through retail stores. In 2008, Oregon and Michigan were the only bottle deposit states without a redemption center and also had the highest redemption rates.

On April 1, 2017, the refund value was increased to 10 cents per container from 5 cents per container. This was the first increase in the history of Oregon Bottle Bill. The change was triggered by a provision of state law enacted by the legislature in 2011, which called for refund value increase to 10 cents if the return rate for containers fell below 80 percent for two consecutive years. The return rate was 64.5% in 2015 and 68.3% in 2014. The return rate is not an indication of recycling rate. Containers recycled through curbside recycling is not accounted in the return rate.

The next change came into effect in January 2018, when additional categories of beverages were required to have a deposit.

2019: Modification to include all kombucha and hard seltzer 3 liters and under into covered beverages. (SB 247). SB 522 was signed into law making fraudulent redemption of out of state container a violation punishable by a fine up to $250.

Also in 2019, dealer redemption center was enacted under SB 93, which was sponsored by OBRC. Dealer redemption centers are stores that have partnered with OBRC to allow containers to be dropped off in bulk in bags from 8AM-8PM and allowing partnered stores to limit individual container returns to 24 per day. The service must be provided without charge and redemption value paid within one week bags being dropped off.

January 2020: The act of returning containers fraudulent became a violation effective January 1, 2020. The OLCC announced the addition of 4oz to 1.5 liter sized Kefir, drinkable yogurt, milk-based smoothies and other beverages which are mostly milk or milk substitute with additions of other ingredients. Milk and plant-based milk substitutes are not covered, however, OLCC withdrew the decision on February 5, 2020 out of concerns about the effects of milk residue on process equipment. In the 2018 expansion, Kefir was exempt from having a refund value.

A 2020 audit conducted by the state recommends shifting some or all of unclaimed deposit to the state. Throughout the history of Oregon Bottle Bill, these funds have been kept by the beverage industry. The 2020 Secretary of State audit recommends all or portions of unredeemed deposit to be remitted to the state for recycling or environmental program as done in all states with bottle deposit except Oregon and Iowa instead of letting OBRC keep it.

==== 2022 expansion ====
Bottle Bill was expanded in June 2022 to include wine in cans, which will become redeemable starting on July 1, 2025.
=== Temporary redemption suspension ===
Bottle redemption enforcement has been suspended twice in the history of Oregon Bottle Bill.

During a part of the COVID-19 pandemic, OLCC temporarily modified the retailer requirements several times. On March 15, 2020, OLCC allowed grocery stores to stop accepting bottle returns during the COVID-19 pandemic through at least the end of May 2020; The Bottle Bill reprieve was amended on May 22, so that enforcement begins two weeks after the county in which the store is located in has entered phased 1 of reopening schedule. Enforcement was re-suspended in counties that reverted to baseline phase. A modification was made to bottle bill requirements during phase 1 reopening allowing retailers that are not open 24 hours a day to limit bottle return hours to 8AM to 6PM. For retailers that are open 24 hours, they were allowed to limit to 7AM to 11PM. Bottle bill enforcement was suspended in March 2020, and again on November 18, 2020. The suspension remained in place in individual counties until COVID-19 risk category as defined by Oregon Health Authority is no longer &quot;extreme&quot; or &quot;high&quot;. Enforcement resumes five days after the respective county is classified as &quot;low&quot; or &quot;medium&quot; by the Oregon Health Authority and suspension is resumed if the status reverts to high or extreme. Retailers in counties classified as &quot;low&quot; or &quot;medium&quot; were allowed to a reduce acceptance hours to 8AM to 6PM for stores that are not open 24 hours and 7AM to 11PM for stores open 24 hours. All pandemic related variance to the Bottle Bill requirements ended on July 5, 2021.

Portland, Multnomah County and State officials said drug addicts are using bottle redemption as a source of funding to buy fentanyl. Oregon governor Tina Kotek and local officials ordered the suspension of bottle redemption at two downtown Portland stores as part of the &quot;90 day fentanyl emergency&quot; to address neighborhood impact such as drugs, crime and homelessness among other issues. The suspension was originally for March 2024, but it was extended until May 1, 2024. Redeeming cans to obtain money to purchase drugs is part of the problem. Downtown residents have complained that retailers being obligated to issue cash refund attracted people who use the money from bottle redemption to buy drugs and use nearby. The two stores issued exemptions were downtown Safeway and a Plaid Pantry location close-by. A week into the exemption, other retailers started seeking exemption as well.

== Context ==
Deposits on refillable glass bottles were the norm well before the 1930s, at which time the disposable steel beverage can began to slowly displace glass. By 1960, almost half of U.S. beer was in cans, while only five percent of soft drinks were not in bottles.

Vermont passed the first &quot;bottle bill&quot; in 1953, but it only banned non-refillable bottles and did not introduce a deposit system. It expired in 1957 after beer industry lobbying.

British Columbia enacted North America&#x27;s oldest beverage deposit system in 1970.

Beverage containers constituted 58% of litter in Kentucky in 1999.
States which have adopted bottle deposits have reduced litter as much as 64%.
The container deposit system cost averages 1.53 cents per container (versus 1.25 cents for other collection systems) and are more than two and a half times more effective at recycling containers.

By 1968, beer and soda companies were responsible for 173 million bottles and 263 million cans each year in Oregon.

=== Oregon Beverage Recycling Cooperative ===
OBRC is the industry steward for the bottle bill and receives all of unclaimed deposit. It was formed in 2009 through the merger of Beverage Recyclers of Oregon and Container Recovery Inc. It represents 96% of beverage distributors in Oregon and operates the BottleDrop redemption centers and green bag program. It is the primary stakeholder of the Oregon Bottle Bill. While the OLCC oversees the bottle bill, OLCC&#x27;s oversight over OBRC is limited. San Francisco&#x27;s bag return program BottleBank is based on its green bag system used in Oregon.

<text>Charles Rudolf Friml (December 7, 1879 – November 12, 1972) was a Czech-born composer of operettas, musicals, songs and piano pieces, as well as a pianist. After musical training and a brief performing career in his native Prague, Friml moved to the United States, where he became a composer. His best-known works are &quot;Rose-Marie&quot; and &quot;The Vagabond King&quot;, each of which enjoyed success on Broadway and in London and were adapted for film.

==Early life==
Friml was born Rudolf Antonín Frymel on December 2, 1879, in Staré Město 445, Prague, Bohemia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire) and was baptized Roman Catholic at the Kostel svatého Jiljí. Friml showed aptitude for music at an early age. He entered the Prague Conservatory in 1895, where he studied the piano and composition with Antonín Dvořák. Friml was expelled from the conservatory in 1901 for performing without permission. In Prague and soon afterwards in America he composed and published songs, piano pieces and other music, including the prize-winning set of songs, &quot;Písně Závišovy&quot;. The last of these, &quot;Za tichých nocí&quot;, later became the basis for a famous film in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in 1941. 

After the conservatory, Friml took a position as accompanist to the violinist Jan Kubelík. He toured with Kubelik twice in the United States (1901–02, 1904) and moved there permanently in 1906, apparently with the support of the Czech singer Emmy Destinn. His first regular post in New York was as a repetiteur at the Metropolitan Opera, but he had made his American piano debut at Carnegie Hall. On November 17, 1904, there, he gave the premiere of his Piano Concerto in B-flat major with the New York Symphony, under the baton of Walter Damrosch, in a concert that also included Friml playing his own Etude de concert, Op. 4, Smetana&#x27;s &quot;Am Seegestade&quot;, Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Liebesträume&quot; No. 3, the Grieg A minor piano concerto with the orchestra, and a solo improvisation. 

He later settled briefly in Los Angeles where he married Mathilde Baruch (in 1909). They had two children, Charles Rudolf Jr. (born 1910) and Marie Lucille (born 1911). His second marriage was to Blanch Betters, an actress who had appeared in the chorus of Friml&#x27;s musical &quot;Katinka&quot;. His third marriage was to actress Elsie Lawson (who played the maid in Friml&#x27;s &quot;Glorianna&quot;, and by whom he had a son, William). His fourth and final marriage was to Kay Wong Ling. The first three marriages ended in divorce.

==&quot;The Firefly&quot; and early operettas==
In 1912, it was announced that operetta diva Emma Trentini would star in a new operetta on Broadway by veteran Victor Herbert and lyricist Otto Harbach titled &quot;The Firefly&quot;. Shortly before the composition of the operetta, Trentini appeared in a special performance of Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot; conducted by Herbert himself. When Trentini refused to sing &quot;Italian Street Song&quot; for an encore, an enraged Herbert stormed out of the orchestra pit refusing any further work with Trentini. Arthur Hammerstein, the upcoming operetta&#x27;s sponsor, frantically began to search for another composer. Not finding another theatre composer of comparable reputation to Herbert, Hammerstein settled on the almost unknown Friml because of his classical training. After a month of work, Friml produced the score for his first theatrical success. 

After tryouts in Syracuse, New York, &quot;The Firefly&quot; opened at Broadway&#x27;s Lyric Theatre on December 2, 1912, to a warm reception by both the audience and the critics. The production moved to the Casino Theatre after Christmas, where it ran until March 15, 1913, for a total of 120 performances. After &quot;The Firefly&quot;, Friml produced three more operettas that each had longer runs than &quot;The Firefly&quot;, although they are not as enduringly successful. These were &quot;High Jinks&quot; (1913), &quot;Katinka&quot; (1915) and &quot;You&#x27;re in Love&quot; (1917). He also contributed songs to a musical in 1915, &quot;The Peasant Girl&quot;.

Trentini was named as a co-respondent in Friml&#x27;s divorce from his first wife in 1915, and evidence was introduced that they were having an affair. Another show, &quot;Sometime&quot;, written with Rida Johnson Young and starring Ed Wynn and Mae West, ran successfully on Broadway in 1918–19.

==Success==
Friml wrote his most successful operettas in the 1920s. In 1924, he wrote &quot;Rose-Marie&quot;. This operetta, on which Friml collaborated with lyricists Oscar Hammerstein II and Otto Harbach and co-composer Herbert Stothart, was a hit worldwide, and a few of the songs from it also became hits including &quot;The Mounties&quot; and &quot;Indian Love Call&quot;. The use of murder as part of the plot was ground-breaking among operettas and musical theatre pieces at the time.

After &quot;Rose-Marie&#x27;s&quot; success came two other hit operettas, &quot;The Vagabond King&quot; in 1925, with lyrics by Brian Hooker and William H. Post, and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; in 1928, with lyrics by P. G. Wodehouse and Clifford Grey, based on Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s famous swashbuckling novel. In addition, Friml contributed to the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; of 1921 and 1923.

Friml wrote music for many films during the 1930s, often songs adapted from previous work. &quot;The Vagabond King&quot;, &quot;Rose-Marie&quot; and &quot;The Firefly&quot; were all made into films and included at least some of Friml&#x27;s music. His operetta version of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; was never filmed. In 1930, he wrote a new operetta score for the film, &quot;The Lottery Bride&quot;. Like his contemporary, Ivor Novello, Friml was sometimes ridiculed for the sentimental and insubstantial nature of his compositions and was often called trite. Friml was also criticized for the old-fashioned, Old World sentiments found in his works. Friml&#x27;s last stage musical was &quot;Music Hath Charms&quot; in 1934. During the 1930s, Friml&#x27;s music fell out of fashion on Broadway and in Hollywood.

==Later years and legacy==
Rather than trying to adapt to popular taste, Friml decided to focus on playing the piano in concert and composing art music, which he did into his nineties. He also composed the music for the 1947 film &quot;Northwest Outpost&quot;, starring Nelson Eddy and Ilona Massey. A few of Friml&#x27;s works have seen revivals on Broadway; these include a 1943 production of &quot;The Vagabond King&quot; and a 1984 production of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. &quot;The Donkey Serenade&quot; from the film version of &quot;The Firefly&quot;, &quot;The Mounties&quot; and &quot;Indian Love Call&quot; are still frequently heard, often in romantic parody or comic situations. His piano music is also often performed.

In 1967, Friml performed in a special concert at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco. As he often did in his concerts, he began the concert with a piano improvisation, then played special arrangements of his own compositions as well as composers who had influenced him. He even played Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Humoresque&quot; as a special tribute to his teacher. He also appeared on Lawrence Welk&#x27;s television program in 1971. He was one of the original inductees into the Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

His two sons also worked as musicians. Rudolf Jr. was a big band leader in the 1930s and 1940s, and William, a son from Friml&#x27;s third marriage, was a composer and arranger in Hollywood. William married Shelby Payne after her divorce from actor Douglas Fowley. In 1969, Friml was celebrated by Ogden Nash on the occasion of his 90th birthday in a couplet which ended: &quot;I trust your conclusion and mine are similar: &#x27;Twould be a happier world if it were Frimler.&quot; Similarly, satiric songwriter Tom Lehrer made a reference to Friml on his first album, &quot;Songs by Tom Lehrer&quot; (1953). The song &quot;The Wiener Schnitzel Waltz&quot; includes the lyric, &quot;Your lips were like wine (if you&#x27;ll pardon the simile) / The music was lovely, and quite Rudolf Friml-y.&quot; Near the end of the 1957 musical &quot;The Music Man&quot;, Harold Hill lies to Marian Paroo: &quot;I&#x27;m expecting a telegram from Rudy Friml, and this could be it.&quot;

Friml died in Los Angeles in 1972 and was interred in the &quot;Court of Honor&quot; at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. On August 18, 2007, a death notice in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that Kay Wong Ling Friml (born March 16, 1913), Friml&#x27;s last wife, died on August 9, 2007, and would be buried with him in Forest Lawn.

<text>Anne Lockhart (born Anne Kathleen Maloney; September 6, 1953) is an American actress. She is best known for her role as Lieutenant Sheba in the 1978–79 television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

==Early life==
Lockhart is the elder of two daughters of actress June Lockhart and the granddaughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart.

Lockhart attended Verde Valley School in Sedona, Arizona, appearing in her first school play as a senior there.

==Career==
===Television===
Lockhart began her career at the age of four, starring as Annie in the short film &quot;T Is for Tumbleweed&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Best Live Action Short Film. She frequently accompanied her mother to the set of &quot;Lassie&quot;, where she made five uncredited appearances between 1959 and 1962. She began making credited guest appearances in 1965 starting with the &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; episode &quot;Magic Locket&quot;. She has since made over 60 guest appearances in network television shows, including multiple appearances on series such as &quot;Knight Rider&quot;; &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;; &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;; &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;; and &quot;&quot;. In 1979, she appeared as Lieutenant Sheba in 11 episodes of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. She also appeared as Officer Kathy Mulligan in the &quot;CHiPs&quot; episode &quot;The Return of the Super Cycle&quot;, and in the episode &quot;A Dream of Jennifer&quot; on &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;.

In 1980, she appeared in a &quot;Magnum PI&quot; episode &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; playing a World War II flashback version of character Diane Westmore played by her mother June Lockhart. Through the 1980s and &#x27;90s, Lockhart appeared steadily in a variety of credited and uncredited roles primarily on television series. She appeared on &quot;Airwolf&quot; in episodes, &quot;Random Target&quot; in season two and &quot;Day of Jeopardy&quot; in season three, playing different characters.

In the 2000s and 2010s, Lockhart had several recurring and multiepisode minor roles on series such as &quot;The Lying Game&quot;, &quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise shows, and &quot;Chicago Fire&quot;. These roles were often &quot;uncredited&quot; and as a &quot;policewoman&quot;. She also had similar one-time roles on shows such as &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Raines&quot;, and &quot;Chase&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;B. J. and the Bear&quot; in the episode &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;.

===Film===
Lockhart&#x27;s first film role was playing Dora in the 1973 Western &quot;Jory&quot;. That same year, she appeared in the critically acclaimed &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; episode &quot;Lisa, Bright and Dark&quot;, alongside Kay Lenz, Anne Baxter, and John Forsythe. She then appeared in the films &quot;Slashed Dreams&quot; (1975) and &quot;Joyride&quot; (1977), with Robert Carradine and Melanie Griffith. She played the young Eunice St. Clair in the 1986 horror film &quot;Troll&quot;, with her mother playing the older version of her character. Her other film credits include &quot;Just Tell Me You Love Me&quot; (1978), &quot;Hambone and Hillie&quot; (1983) opposite Lillian Gish, &quot;Young Warriors&quot; (1983), &quot;The Oasis&quot; (1984), &quot;The Serpent Warriors&quot; (1985), &quot;Dark Tower&quot; (1989), &quot;Big Bad John&quot; (1990), &quot;Bug Buster&quot; (1998), &quot;A Dog&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1999), &quot;Daybreak&quot; (2000), &quot;Cahoots&quot; (2001), &quot;Hollywood, It&#x27;s a Dog&#x27;s Life&quot; (2004), &quot;ExTerminators&quot; (2009), and &quot;Dakota&#x27;s Summer&quot; (2014).

Though Lockhart herself claims no recollection of being approached, she was reportedly John Carpenter&#x27;s first choice to play the role of main character Laurie Strode in &quot;Halloween&quot; (1978). Other commitments kept her from doing so, and the part was played by Jamie Lee Curtis in the original and its many sequels.

===Other acting===
In addition to her television and film appearances, Lockhart has also worked extensively in television commercials and voice acting. In 1997, she began working with Lane Davies to form the Kingsmen Shakespeare Festival, the forerunner of the Kingsmen Shakespeare Company, which offers seminars and summer camps aimed at teaching children ages 8–16 various acting techniques.
In recent years she has appeared onstage as Eleanor in &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; (2010) and as Virginia in &quot;It&#x27;s Only a Play&quot; (2016) at River City Repertory Theatre.
==Personal life==
On December 24, 1986, Lockhart married Adam Carlyle Taylor, the son of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; actor Buck Taylor and Judy Nugent. They had two children: a daughter, Carlyle, and a son, Zane. Taylor died in a motorcycle accident in Ennis, Montana on June 4, 1994 at the age of 27.

A Catholic, Lockhart met Pope John Paul II in 1985 when she was invited to attend a papal audience in St. Peter&#x27;s Square. She is also an expert horsewoman, having won championships in cutting, reining, team penning, and barrel racing.

<text>The Bug or Western Bug is a major river in Central Europe that flows through Belarus (border), Poland, and Ukraine, with a total length of . A tributary of the Narew, the Bug forms part of the border between Belarus and Poland for and part of the border between Ukraine and Poland for . 

The Bug is connected with the Dnieper by the Dnieper–Bug Canal. Out of its drainage basin, half is in Poland, just over a quarter in Belarus, and slightly under a quarter in Ukraine.

==History==
According to Zbigniew Gołąb, the Slavic hydronym &quot;Bug&quot; as &quot;*bugъ&quot;/&quot;*buga&quot; derives from the Proto-Indo-European verbal root &quot;*bheug-&quot; (with cognates in old Proto-Germanic &quot;*bheugh-&quot; etc. with the meaning &#x27;bend, turn, move away&#x27;), with the hypothetical original meaning &#x27;pertaining to a (river) bend&#x27;, and derivatives in Russian &quot;búga&quot; &#x27;low banks of a river overgrown with bushes&#x27;, Polish &quot;bugaj&quot; &#x27;bushes or woods in a river valley or on a steep river bank&#x27;, and Latvian &quot;bauga&quot; &#x27;marshy place by a river&#x27;.

Traditionally (e.g., by the drafters of the Curzon Line), the Bug River has been considered the ethnographic border between the East and West as well as the border between Orthodox (Ukrainians, Belarusians) and Catholic (Poles) peoples. 

The Bug was part of the frontier between the territories occupied by Austria, Russia, and Prussia after the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, the southern half of the eastern border of the Duchy of Warsaw and Lithuanian Provisional Governing Commission (1809–1815), Congress Poland and Russia proper (1815–1867), of the Vistula Land and Russia proper (1867–1913), and of the Regency Kingdom of Poland and BPR (1917–1918). The Bug also formed part of the dividing line between German Wehrmacht and Soviet Red Army zones specified in a secret clause of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty of 28 September 1939 following the September 1939 invasion of Poland in the Second World War.

==Geographic characteristics==
The Bug is a left tributary of the Narew. It flows from the Lviv Oblast in the west of Ukraine northwards into the Volyn Oblast, before passing along the Ukraine-Polish and Polish-Belarusian border and into Poland, where it follows part of the border between the Masovian and Podlaskie Voivodeships. It joins the Narew at Serock, a few kilometers upstream of the artificial Zegrze Lake.

This part of the Narew between the confluence and the Vistula is sometimes referred to as Bugo-Narew but on December 27, 1962, the Prime Minister of Poland&#x27;s act abolished the name &quot;Bugo-Narew&quot;, soon after Zegrze Lake was completed.

On the Bug, a few kilometers from the Vysokaye in Kamenets District of the Brest Region, is the westernmost point of Belarus. It is also connected with the Dnieper via the Mukhavets, a right-bank tributary, by the Dnieper-Bug Canal.

==Basin==

The total basin area of the Bug is of which half, or, 50%, is in Poland. Somewhat more than a quarter, or 29%, is in Belarus, and a bit under a quarter, or 22% lies in Ukraine.

The climate of the Bug basin is temperate.

The basin experiences annual high-water levels during spring flooding due to thawing snow, after which a low flow period starts and lasts until October or mid-November. Occasional summer floods often occur in the headlands, where mountains influence favorable flash-flood conditions. In Autumn the water level increases are inconsiderable; in some years they do not happen at all. During the winter the river can have temporary ice-outs that sometimes provoke ice jams, causing an increase of the level up to . The resultant water levels are changeable due to the instability of ice cover.

==Flooding==

Significant floods during the last 60 years in Belarus were registered in 1958, 1962, 1967, 1971 and 1974. The largest spring flood was observed in 1979, when the maximum water discharge was 19.1 cubic metres per second on 24 March 1979, at the village of Chersk; 166 cubic metres per second near the village of Tyukhinichi (Lyasnaya river) on 31 March 1979; and 269 cubic metres per second near Brest on 1 April 1979. A similar spring flood occurred in 1999 when the spring run-off in March–May exceeded the average annual value by almost half again (48%).

The last time the Bug flooded in Poland and Ukraine was in 2010 and the last time it flooded in Belarus was in 1999.

<text>The Southern Bug, also called Southern Buh (; ; or just ), and sometimes Boh River (; ), is a navigable river located in Ukraine. It is the second-longest river flowing exclusively in Ukraine.

While located in relatively close proximity, the river should not be confused with Western Bug or Bug which flows in opposite direction towards Baltics. The source of the Southern Bug is in the west of Ukraine, in the Volhynian-Podolian Upland, about from the Polish border, from where it flows southeasterly into the Bug Estuary (Black Sea basin) through the southern steppes (see Granite-steppe lands of Buh park). It is long and drains .

Several regionally important cities and towns in Ukraine are located on the Southern Bug. Beginning in Western Ukraine and moving downstream, in a southeasterly direction, they are: Khmelnytskyi, Khmilnyk, Vinnytsia, Haivoron, Pervomaisk, Voznesensk and Mykolaiv.

On several occasions the river served as an international border. At least following the 1768–1774 Russo-Turkish War, and more narrowly the Chyhyryn campaigns, the river became a border between the Imperial Russia and Ottomans. Some 200 years later between 1941 and 1944 during World War II the Southern Bug formed the border between German-occupied Ukraine (Reichskommissariat Ukraine) and the Romanian-occupied part of Ukraine, called Transnistria.

== Nomenclature and etymology ==
Herodotus (c. 484–425 BCE) refers to the river using its ancient Greek name: Hypanis. During the Migration Period of the 5th to the 8th centuries CE the Southern Bug represented a major obstacle to all the migrating peoples in the area. In his work Getica, Jordanes calls the river Bogossola. Mentioning of Bogossola could also be found in works of Guido of Pisa.

The long-standing local Slavic name of the river, &quot;Boh&quot; (Cyrillic: Бог), according to Zbigniew Gołąb as &quot;*bugъ&quot;/&quot;*buga&quot; derives from Indo-European verbal root &quot;*bheug-&quot; (having cognates in old Germanic word &quot;*bheugh-&quot; etc. with meaning of &quot;bend, turn, moves away&quot;), with hypothetical original meaning of &quot;pertaining to a (river) bend&quot;, and derivatives in Russian &quot;búga&quot; (&quot;low banks of a river, overgrown with bushes&quot;), Polish &quot;bugaj&quot; (&quot;bushes or woods in a river valley or on a steep river bank&quot;), Latvian &quot;bauga&quot; (&quot;marshy place by a river&quot;). The Polish linguist Jan Michał Rozwadowski was explaining that the name derived from the Indo-European root &quot;water&quot;, &quot;source&quot;, &quot;swamp&quot;. The 17th-century French military engineer and geographer Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan recorded the name of the river as &quot;Bog&quot;.

== History ==

From the 16th to the 18th centuries most of the south of Ukraine was under Turkish imperial domination and the colonists renamed the river using their language to the &quot;Aq-su&quot;, meaning the &quot;White river&quot;. Indigenous Slavic toponyms were re-established after the conquest of the Pontic region from Turkish domination in the 17th and 18th centuries.

On March 6, 1918, the Central Council of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic adopted a law on the &quot;administrative-territorial division of Ukraine&quot;, dividing it into regional districts. One of these, Pobozhia (meaning lands of the &quot;Boh&quot;, ), was in the upstream lands of the Southern Bug, near the source of the river.

==Tributaries==
The main tributaries of the Southern Bug are, from source to mouth (length in parentheses):
* Left: Buzhok (75), Ikva (57), Snyvoda (58), Desna (80), Sob (115), Udych (56), Synytsia (78), Synyukha (111), Velyka Korabelna (45), Mertvovid (114), Hnylyi Yelanets (103), Inhul (354)
* Right: Vovk (71), Zghar (95), Riv (104), Silnytsia (67), Dokhna (68), Savran (97), Kodyma (149), Bakshala (57), Chychyklia (156)

==Ecology==
In October 2020, the Southern Bug was stocked with three hundred and fifty kilograms of Hungarian carp and 50 kilograms of silver carp at Khmelnytskyi.

==Bridges and ferries==

The Varvarivskyi Bridge over Southern Bug in Mykolaiv is a swing bridge (facilitating ship building) with Europe&#x27;s largest span (134 m). It is also the southernmost bridge over the river.

==Navigation==
The river is technically navigable for dozens of kilometers up from its mouth; several river ports (such as Mykolaiv) exist.

In 2011, plans were announced to revive commercial freight navigation on the Southern Bug upstream of Mykolaiv, to facilitate the increasing grain export from Ukraine. As of April 2018, freight navigation was renewed between the estuary and a newly built grain terminal in the village of Prybuzhany, Voznesensk Raion, in the center of the Mykolaiv Oblast.

<doc id="605716" wikidata="Q935268" url="?curid=605716" title="Hungarian literature">
<text>Hungarian literature is the body of written works primarily produced in Hungarian, and may also include works written in other languages (mostly Latin), either produced by Hungarians or having topics which are closely related to Hungarian culture. While it was less known in the English-speaking world for centuries, Hungary&#x27;s literature gained renown in the 19th and 20th centuries, thanks to a new wave of internationally accessible writers like Mór Jókai, Antal Szerb, Sándor Márai, Imre Kertész and Magda Szabó.

==Earliest writings in the 10th-14th century==


The beginning of the history of Hungarian language as such (the proto-Hungarian period) is set at 1000 BC, when according to current theory, the language had become differentiated from its closest relatives, the Ob-Ugric languages. No written evidence remains of the earliest Hungarian literature, but through folktales and folk songs, elements have survived that can be traced back to pagan times. Also extant, although only in Latin and dating from between the 11th and 14th centuries, are shortened versions of some Hungarian legends relating the origins of the Hungarian people and episodes from the conquest of Hungary and from campaigns of the 10th century.

In earliest times the Hungarian language was written in a runic-like script, although it was not used for literary purposes in the modern sense. The country switched to the Latin alphabet after being Christianized under the reign of Stephen I (1000–1038). There are no existing documents from the pre-11th century era. The Old Hungarian period is reckoned from 896 CE, when Hungarians conquered the Carpathian Basin, settled down and started to build their own state. Creation of the first extant written records followed soon after. The oldest written record in Hungarian is a fragment in the Establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany (1055) which contains several Hungarian terms, among them the words &quot;feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea,&quot; (&quot;up the military road to Fehérvár,&quot; referring to the place where the abbey was built). This text is probably to be read as &quot;Fehérü váru reá meneü hodu utu reá&quot; with today&#x27;s spelling, and it would read as &quot;a Fehérvárra menő had[i] útra&quot; in today&#x27;s Hungarian. The rest of the document was written in Latin.

The oldest complete, continuous text in Hungarian is &quot;Halotti beszéd és könyörgés&quot;, a short funeral oration written in about 1192–1195, moving in its simplicity. The oldest poem is &quot;Ómagyar Mária-siralom&quot; (the Lamentations of Mary), a free translation from Latin of a poem by Godefroy de Breteuil. It is also the oldest surviving Uralic poem. Both the funeral sermon and the Lamentations are hard to read and not quite comprehensible for modern-day Hungarians, mostly because the 26-letter Latin alphabet was not sufficient to represent all the sounds in Hungarian before diacritic marks and double letters were added.

During the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance, the language of writing was mostly Latin. Important documents include the &quot;Admonitions of St. Stephen,&quot; which includes the king&#x27;s admonitions to his son Prince Imre.

Among the first chronicles about Hungarian history were Gesta Hungarorum (&quot;Deeds of the Hungarians&quot;), by an unknown author, and Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum (&quot;Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians&quot;) by Simon Kézai. Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot; (&quot;Illustrated Chronicle&quot;), which was written for King Louis the Great by Mark of Kalt in 1358.

Further, Rogerius&#x27;s 13th-century work was published with Thuróczy chronicle in the late 15th century. In Split (now a part of Croatia) Thomas of Spalato wrote on local history, with much information on Hungary in the 13th century. At that time Dalmatia and the city of Split were part of the Kingdom of Hungary.

==Renaissance and Baroque during the 15th-17th centuries==
The 15th century saw the first translations from the Bible. Two Transylvanian preachers, Thomas and Valentine, followers of the Bohemian religious reformer Jan Hus, were responsible for this work, of which the prophetic books, the Psalms, and the Gospels have survived. A great part of the vocabulary created for the purpose is still in use.

Renaissance literature flourished under the reign of King Matthias (1458–1490). Janus Pannonius, although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian humanist poet of the period.

The Buda Chronicle was published in 1473, it was produced by András Hess in Buda, and is the first incunabulum ever printed in Hungary. Thus, the year 1473 is considered the beginning of Hungarian book printing. The &quot;Chronica Hungarorum&quot; from the Hess printing house in Buda is unprecedented in Europe in the 15th century, because no other country&#x27;s history of printing begins with the publication of a folk&#x27;s history. This is the first example, that the printing history of a country begin with the publication of the history of a people. The Hungarian book printing preceded England, Spain, and Austria. In fact, the number of printing houses was not too high at that time. At the end of the 1470s, 66 printing houses could operate in Europe, of which two were in the Kingdom of Hungary (in Buda and Pozsony (now Bratislava)).

In 1526 most of Hungary fell under Ottoman occupation, from which date the beginning of the Middle Hungarian period is set, in connection with various cultural changes. The most important poets of the period were Bálint Balassi (1554–1594), Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos (c. 1510–1556) and Miklós Zrínyi (1620–1664). Balassi&#x27;s poetry shows Mediaeval influences. His poems can be divided into three thematic categories: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zrínyi&#x27;s most significant work, &quot;Szigeti veszedelem&quot; (&quot;Peril of Sziget&quot;, 1648/49) is an epic written in the style of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, and recounts the heroic Battle of Szigetvár, where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetvár.
Translation of Roman authors produced also some works: János Baranyai Decsi translated Sallust&#x27;s &quot;Catalina&quot; and Jughurta&#x27;s war in the late 16th century. A decade later appeared the translation of Curtius Rufus&#x27;s life of Alexander in Debrecen.

Historical works were even more numerous: the chronicle of Gáspár Heltai, published by him in Kolozsvár; Zay Ferenc&#x27;s unpublished work on the siege of Belgrade from the 15th century; Kemény János&#x27;s Transylvanian Dukes, and Miklós Bethlen&#x27;s memoirs with János Szalárdy&#x27;s voluminous then-unpublished work on Transylvanian history from Bethlen&#x27;s reign to the 1660s; and Mihály Cserei&#x27;s early 18th-century work are highlights of Hungarian-language literature. Another category is historical verses in Hungarian, like that of Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos from the 16th century, Péter Ilosvai Selymes, Mihály Szabatkai and Gergely Bornemissza.

Latin works in the period are more numerous. István Szamosközy, János Baranyai Decsi, Miklós Istvánffy, János Bethlen, and Farkas Bethlen, Ferenc Forgách, György Szerémi, Ambrus Somogyi, Gianmichele Bruto and Oláh Miklós are the most important authors of historical works from the 16th to 17th century. In German Georg Kraus and Georg Zeiler wrote on Transylvanian history. In Spanish one may read Bernardo de Aldana&#x27;s apology for the 1552 loss of the castle of Lippa to the Turks.

Among religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by Gáspár Károli, the Protestant pastor of Gönc, in 1590. The translation is called the &quot;Bible of Vizsoly&quot;, after the town where it was first published. Another important religious work is the &quot;Legend of Saint Margaret&quot;, copied by Lea Ráskai around 1510 from an earlier work that did not survive.

==Enlightenment and the language reform==

The first Enlightenment writers in Hungary were Maria Theresia&#x27;s bodyguards (György Bessenyei, János Batsányi and so on). The greatest poets of the time were Mihály Csokonai Vitéz and Dániel Berzsenyi.

The most prominent figure of Hungarian language reform was Ferenc Kazinczy, who helped make the Hungarian language a useful tool for scientific theorization; many new words were coined for describing new inventions, for example, &quot;mozdony&quot; (locomotive).

<doc id="605721" wikidata="Q1670841" url="?curid=605721" title="Ordos Desert">
<text>The Ordos Desert () is a desert/steppe region in Northwest China, administered under the prefecture of Ordos City in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region (centered ca. ). It extends over an area of approximately , and comprises two sub-deserts: China&#x27;s 7th-largest desert, the Kubuqi Desert, in the north; and China&#x27;s 8th-largest desert, the Mu Us Desert, in the south. Wedged between the arable Hetao region to the north and the Loess Plateau to the south, the soil of the Ordos Desert is mostly a mixture of dry clay and sand, and as a result is poorly suited for agriculture.

==Location==
The Ordos Desert is almost completely encircled in the west, north and east by a great rectangular bend of the middle Yellow River known as the Ordos Loop. Mountain ranges separate the Ordos from the Gobi Desert north and east of the Yellow River. The northern border serves as the southern border of the Mu Us Desert. The mountain chains separating the Ordos from the central Gobi in the north of the great bend of the Yellow River are: the Kara-naryn-ula, the Sheitenula, and the Yin Mountains, which link on to the south end of the Greater Khingan Mountains. In the south and east, the Great Wall of China separates the Ordos from fertile loess lands. The Ordos covers the southern section of Inner Mongolia, an Autonomous Region of China; Ningxia, an Autonomous Entity of China; and the Chinese Provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu.

==Relief==
The Ordos Desert forms an intermediate step in the descent from the Himalayas to the lowlands of eastern China. Towards the south it rises to an altitude of over 1,500 m, and in the west, along the right bank of the Yellow River, the Arbus or Arbiso Mountains, which overlie the steppe by some 900 m, serve to link the Helan Mountains with the Yin Mountains. The northern part of the great bend of the Yellow River is filled with the sands of Kuzupchi River, a succession of dunes, 12–15 m high. In some places these sand dunes approach close to the Yellow River; in others they are parted from it by a belt of sand, intermingled with clay, which terminates in a steep escarpment, 15 m and in some localities 30 m above the river.

Eventually the sand dunes cross over to the left bank of the Yellow River where they are threaded by the beds of dry watercourses. The Yin Mountains, which stretch from 108° to 112° E in the north of the great bend of the Yellow River, have a wild alpine character and are distinguished from other mountains in the southeast of Mongolia by an abundance of both water and vegetation. In one of their constituent ranges, the bold Muni-uul, long and nearly wide, they attain elevations of , and have steep flanks, slashed with rugged gorges and narrow glens.

==Climate==
The desert receives less than 250 mm of precipitation annually, and most of this is in the form of summer thunderstorms. The region has many salt lakes and intermittent streams. Winters are bitter cold, with cold winds blowing into the region from the north and west, and January temperatures ranging from .

==Fauna and flora==
The vegetation of the Ordos region is made up of montane grasslands and shrublands. Among the sand dunes in the north, shrubs including &quot;Hedysarum scoparium&quot; and &quot;Calligonum arborescens&quot; grow in scattered patches. Native grasses and herbs include &quot;Bromus inermis, Agropyron mongolicum, A. cristatum, Festuca arundinacea, Elymus dahuricus, Melilotus albus, M. officinalis, Lotus corniculatus, Pugionium cornutum, Astragalus adsurgens,&quot; and &quot;Filifolium sibiricum&quot;. The belt of sand and clay which separates the sand dunes from the Huang He in places is studded with little mounds (up to 1.2 m high), mostly overgrown with wormwood &quot;(Artemisia campestris)&quot; and the Siberian pea-tree &quot;(Caragana spp.)&quot;; and here too grows one of the most characteristic plants of Ordos, the liquorice root &quot;(Glycyrrhiza uralensis)&quot;. On the left bank of the Huang He, level spaces amongst the dry river beds are studded with little mounds (9 cm to 1.8 m high), on which grow stunted &quot;Nitraria schoberi&quot; and &quot;Zygophyllum.&quot; Towards the south, sparse scrub vegetation is found. Forest thickets thrive along the river margins.

In the Yin Mountains, forests begin at altitudes of 1,600 m and wild flowers grow in great profusion and variety in summer, though with a striking lack of color. In this same border range there is also a much greater abundance and variety of animal life, especially among the birds.

Rare bird species also breed in the saline lakes of the Ordos, among them relict gulls (&quot;Larus relictus&quot;) breeding at Lake Hongjiannao; for this species the Ordos is home to the world&#x27;s largest breeding colony.

The present status of large mammals in the region is largely unclear. In the past, it was inhabited by wild two-humped Bactrian camels, snow leopards, Przewalski&#x27;s gazelles, and Przewalski&#x27;s horses.

==History==
Chinese names of the Ordos region were He-tau and – later – He-nan (&quot;the country south of the river&quot;). It was occupied by horse nomads for many centuries, and these were very often at war with China. In the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, it was occupied by the Xiongnu. It was almost depopulated during and after the Dungan revolt of 1869.

This region was a desert during the Late Glacial Maximum. During the Holocene Climatic Optimum the monsoonal rains that reached the Loess Plateau in the modern era pushed the desert back to the Yellow River. Since then, overgrazing at various periods and in the modern period, the lack of rainfall, has resulted in a return to desert conditions. However, the most disastrous damage to the environment was caused by the political movements launched by Mao Zedong, namely the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, during which the thin line of fragile vegetation separating the Kubuqi and Maowusu deserts was destroyed. Subsequent pressure of population and the increase in sheep/goats/cattle further damaged the already weakened local environment to the point of no return, and as a result, the two deserts finally linked up in the 1990s, forming the larger current-day Ordos.

==Economy==
The alkaline soil allows for some nomadic Mongol herders to raise sheep and goats. Heavy grazing by goats has done damage to the grasslands in the region and led to desertification. The oasis in the region support small-scale farming. The area contains large soda deposits which are heavily mined.

<doc id="605727" wikidata="Q848810" url="?curid=605727" title="Kronecker's theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Kronecker&#x27;s theorem is a theorem about diophantine approximation, introduced by .

Kronecker&#x27;s approximation theorem had been firstly proved by L. Kronecker in the end of the 19th century. It has been now revealed to relate to the idea of n-torus and Mahler measure since the later half of the 20th century. In terms of physical systems, it has the consequence that planets in circular orbits moving uniformly around a star will, over time, assume all alignments, unless there is an exact dependency between their orbital periods.

== Statement ==
Kronecker&#x27;s theorem is a result in diophantine approximations applying to several real numbers &quot;xi&quot;, for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, that generalises Dirichlet&#x27;s approximation theorem to multiple variables.

The classical Kronecker approximation theorem is formulated as follows. 

:&quot;Given real &quot;n&quot;-tuples formula_1 and formula_2 , the condition: &quot;
::formula_3 
:&quot;holds if and only if for any formula_4 with&quot;
::formula_5
:&quot;the number formula_6 is also an integer.&quot;

In plainer language, the first condition states that the tuple formula_7 can be approximated arbitrarily well by linear combinations of the formula_8s (with integer coefficients) and integer vectors.

For the case of a formula_9 and formula_10, Kronecker&#x27;s Approximation Theorem can be stated as follows. For any formula_11 with formula_12 irrational and formula_13 there exist integers formula_14 and formula_15 with formula_16, such that 
::formula_17

==Relation to tori==

In the case of &quot;N&quot; numbers, taken as a single &quot;N&quot;-tuple and point &quot;P&quot; of the torus

:&quot;T&quot; = &quot;RN/ZN&quot;,

the closure of the subgroup &lt;&quot;P&quot;&gt; generated by &quot;P&quot; will be finite, or some torus &quot;T′&quot; contained in &quot;T&quot;. The original Kronecker&#x27;s theorem (Leopold Kronecker, 1884) stated that the necessary condition for

:&quot;T′&quot; = &quot;T&quot;,

which is that the numbers &quot;xi&quot; together with 1 should be linearly independent over the rational numbers, is also sufficient. Here it is easy to see that if some linear combination of the &quot;xi&quot; and 1 with non-zero rational number coefficients is zero, then the coefficients may be taken as integers, and a character χ of the group &quot;T&quot; other than the trivial character takes the value 1 on &quot;P&quot;. By Pontryagin duality we have &quot;T′&quot; contained in the kernel of χ, and therefore not equal to &quot;T&quot;.

In fact a thorough use of Pontryagin duality here shows that the whole Kronecker theorem describes the closure of &lt;&quot;P&quot;&gt; as the intersection of the kernels of the χ with

:χ(&quot;P&quot;) = 1.

This gives an (antitone) Galois connection between monogenic closed subgroups of &quot;T&quot; (those with a single generator, in the topological sense), and sets of characters with kernel containing a given point. Not all closed subgroups occur as monogenic; for example a subgroup that has a 
torus of dimension ≥ 1 as connected component of the identity element, and that is not connected, cannot be such a subgroup.

The theorem leaves open the question of how well (uniformly) the multiples &quot;mP&quot; of &quot;P&quot; fill up the closure. In the one-dimensional case, the distribution is uniform by the equidistribution theorem.

<text>Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (; ; ; 12 January 1746 – 17 February 1827) was a Swiss pedagogue and educational reformer who exemplified Romanticism in his approach.

He founded several educational institutions both in German- and French-speaking regions of Switzerland and wrote many works explaining his revolutionary modern principles of education. His motto was &quot;Learning by head, hand and heart&quot;. Thanks to Pestalozzi, illiteracy in 18th-century Switzerland was overcome almost completely by 1830.

== Life ==
=== Early years, 1746–1765 ===

Pestalozzi was born on 12 January 1746, in Zürich, Switzerland. His father was a surgeon and oculist who died at age 33 when Pestalozzi, the second of three children, was five years old; he belonged to a family who had fled the area around Locarno due to its Protestant faith. His mother, whose maiden name was Hotze, was a native of Wädenswil on the lake of Zürich. The family also had a maid, Barbara Schmid, nicknamed Babeli. After the death of Pestalozzi&#x27;s father it was only through the help of Babeli that Pestalozzi&#x27;s mother could financially support the family.

In 1761, Pestalozzi attended the Gymnasium (Collegium Humanitatis) and received instruction from educators Johann Jakob Bodmer, who taught history and politics, and Johann Jakob Breitinger, who taught Greek and Hebrew.

On holidays Pestalozzi would visit his maternal grandfather, a clergyman in Höngg. Together they would travel to schools and the houses of parishioners. It was through these visits that Pestalozzi learned the poverty of country peasants. He saw the consequences of putting children to work in factories at an early age and he saw how little the Catechism schools did for them. Their ignorance, suffering and inability to help themselves left an impression on Pestalozzi, an impression that would guide his future educational ideas.

Pestalozzi was educated to become a clergyman. As a clergyman, he expected to have ample opportunity to carry out his educational ideas; however, the failure of his first sermon and influence from philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau led him to pursue a career in law and political justice.
=== Young adulthood and early political aspirations, 1765–1767 ===
During the mid-18th century the government in Switzerland condemned Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Emile&quot; and &quot;Social Contract&quot;, saying they were dangerous to the State and the Christian religion. A prison sentence was issued upon Rousseau. Bodmer, Pestalozzi&#x27;s former professor, embraced the teachings of Rousseau and founded the Helvetic Society with about 20 other philosophers in 1765. Their goal was the advancement of freedom. The 19-year-old Pestalozzi was an active member, contributing many articles to the Society&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;Der Erinnerer&quot;.

Pestalozzi brought to light several cases of official corruption and was believed to be an accessory to the escape of a fellow newspaper contributor. Although he was later proven innocent, he was under arrest for three days. These events caused Pestalozzi to have many political enemies and destroyed any hope of a legal career.

=== Neuhof, 1769–1779 ===
After the failure of his political aspirations and at the suggestion of several friends, Pestalozzi decided to become a farmer. During this time, Johann Rudolf Tschiffeli, who was also a member of the Helvetic Society, attracted widespread attention regarding his successful business model. He had converted a large plot of worthless land into several valuable farms. In 1767 Pestalozzi visited Tschiffeli to learn about his method. After a year with Tschiffeli, Pestalozzi purchased 15 acres of waste land in the neighborhood of Zürich. He obtained financial support from a Zürich banker, bought more land and, in 1769, he married Anna Schulthess.

Pestalozzi began to build a house on the heavily mortgaged property, calling it &quot;Neuhof&quot;. The land he had bought, however, was unsuitable to farm. Unfavorable reports led the banker to withdraw his support. Pestalozzi added a wool-spinning business to the farm, hoping to improve his financial situation. The challenges increased as much as his debt. Three months after their financial support was withdrawn, Schulthess gave birth to the couple&#x27;s only son, Jean-Jacques Pestalozzi. He was nicknamed Schaggeli and often had epileptic fits that led Pestalozzi and Schulthess to worry constantly about his health.

==== Transition from farm to industrial school at Neuhof ====
After the failure of his farming venture, Pestalozzi wanted to help the poor. He had been poor himself most of his life and had observed orphans who gained apprenticeships as farmers only to be overworked and underfed. He desired to teach them how to live self-respecting lives. This led him to the conception of converting Neuhof into an industrial school. Against the wishes of his wife&#x27;s family, Pestalozzi gained the support of philosopher Isaak Iselin of Basel, who published it in &quot;Die Ephemerides&quot;, a periodical devoted to social and economic questions. The publication led to subscriptions and loans free of interest. The new foundation had a short period of apparent prosperity, but after a year Pestalozzi&#x27;s old faults again led the institution to near ruin. An appeal for public support in 1777 brought much-needed help, and Pestalozzi contributed to the periodical a series of letters on the education of the poor. The appeal, however, only postponed the failure of the institution. In 1779, Pestalozzi had to close Neuhof. With help from his friends, Pestalozzi was able to save the house at Neuhof for himself and his family to live in. Despite the property being saved, they were in financial ruin and were reduced to poverty. His family connections abandoned him, along with most people who had shown interest in his ideas.

=== Period of literary activity, 1780–1797 ===
==== &quot;The Evening Hours of a Hermit&quot;, 1780 ====
Iselin remained a friend of Pestalozzi and encouraged him to continue writing. In 1780 Pestalozzi published anonymously in &quot;Die Ephemerides&quot; a series of aphorisms entitled &quot;The Evening Hours of a Hermit&quot;. They are his earliest works which outline ideas that would later be known as Pestalozzian. The aphorisms attracted little attention at the time of publication.

==== &quot;Leonard and Gertrude&quot;, 1781, 1783, 1785, 1787 ====
Pestalozzi knew the country peasant life much more intimately than his contemporaries did, from the visits of his childhood with his grandfather to his current state of poverty. He drew from these experiences and published four volumes of a story titled &quot;Leonard and Gertrude&quot;. These four volumes revolve around the lives of four characters: Gertrude, Glüphi, an unnamed parish clergyman and Arner. Gertrude is a wife and mother from the village of Bonnal, who teaches her children how to live moral upstanding lives through the belief and love of God. Glüphi, a school teacher, sees the success Gertrude has with her children and tries to model his school around her teachings. A parish clergyman also adopts Gertrude&#x27;s teachings and the work of Gertrude, Glüphi and the clergyman are helped by Arner, a politician, who solicits aid from the state. Through these four institutions, harmony is achieved and a comprehensive education is offered to all people.

The first volume was very successful; however, the second through fourth volumes were not widely published or read.

===== Fifth and sixth volumes =====
Pestalozzi had planned a fifth and sixth volume, but the manuscript of the fifth was lost in his 1804 trip to Paris and it is not known if a sixth was ever written.

==== &quot;Christopher and Elizabeth&quot; and the &quot;Schweizerblatt&quot;, 1782 ====
Pestalozzi wrote &quot;Christopher and Elizabeth&quot; in 1782 as a series of evening conversations to address social and political corruption. A weekly newspaper called the &quot;Schweizerblatt&quot; was also founded and disbanded during the same year with Pestalozzi briefly acting as the chief editor.

==== &quot;Enquiries into the Course of Nature in the Development of the Human Race&quot;, 1797 ====
In 1794 Pestalozzi visited his sister in Leipzig. During the visit, he met Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Christoph Martin Wieland and Johann Gottfried Herder. On his return trip to Neuhof, he met Johann Gottlieb Fichte. Fichte saw in Pestalozzi&#x27;s ideas the key to the solution of the educational problem, and suggested to Pestalozzi that he write about his views on human nature and the problem of its development. After three years, Pestalozzi wrote and published &quot;Enquiries into the Course of Nature in the development of the Human Race&quot;. Few people read his work, and in an 1821 edition, Pestalozzi wrote: 

This work marked the end of his eighteen-year literary period, during which time Pestalozzi and his family lived a life of poverty. His wife was often ill, and in 1797 his son returned home from his apprenticeship in Basel in a similar state of health.

=== Stans, 1799 ===

Political changes were taking place, and when serfdom was abolished in Switzerland in 1798, Pestalozzi decided to become an educator. He wrote a plan for a school and submitted it to Philipp Albert Stapfer, the new Minister of Arts and Sciences, who approved of Pestalozzi&#x27;s plan. Pestalozzi was not able to implement his new school right away, because a suitable site could not be found quickly enough. In the meantime, Pestalozzi was asked to take charge of a government newspaper, the &quot;Helvetisches Volksblatt&quot;, in hopes that he could win the acceptance of the people of Switzerland. Political change of any kind during this period was viewed as tyrannical.

When the French army invaded the town of Stans in 1798, many children were left without a home or family. The Swiss government established an orphanage and recruited Pestalozzi on 5 December 1798, to take charge of the newly formed institution. On 7 December, Pestalozzi went to Stans, writing:

The buildings of the Ursuline Convent at Stans were supposed to have been converted into an orphanage, but little had been done when Pestalozzi arrived. On 14 January 1799, a number of orphans came to the newly established institution. Pestalozzi wrote, . He took many roles at Stans, including a master, servant, father, guardian, sick-nurse and teacher. He had no school materials and his only assistant was a housekeeper.

Drawing from previous experience, his aim at Stans was similar to that of Neuhof: the combination of education and industry. However, he no longer looked at the products of the children&#x27;s labors as a possible source of income. Any work was considered by Pestalozzi as a way to train physical dexterity, promote efficiency and encourage mutual helpfulness. He wanted to cultivate the fundamental activities of the mind— It was during his time at Stans that Pestalozzi realized the significance of a universal method of education, which he would attempt to apply at future institutions.

In June 1799, the French army, after being defeated by the Austrians, took back Stans. They needed every available building to house their troops, and the school was broken up. Even during the short time of the orphanage, Pestalozzi&#x27;s success was apparent in the well-being of the children. He left Stans in order to recover in Gurnigel, an Alpine health resort, hoping to return to the orphanage when the buildings were free, but he was not permitted to return.

=== Burgdorf, 1800–1804 ===

During his recovery in Gurnigel, Stapfer assigned Pestalozzi to the town of Burgdorf. He was to receive a small quarterly salary, an apartment and a position teaching at the lowest school in town. Pestalozzi&#x27;s position was not held long; the shoemaker who ran the school before Pestalozzi had arrived did not agree with his ideas. Shortly after, Pestalozzi was able to transfer to a different school. The children were five to eight years old. Pestalozzi was nervous at first, but he continued his investigations and experiments in education carried out at Stans.

A book was suggested to Pestalozzi by a friend, . Although Pestalozzi said he did not know much French, what he was able to understand . It confirmed his ideas of education that he had developed at Neuhof, Stans, and now Burgdorf, in which all understanding can be achieved through a psychologically ordered sequence.

In January 1800, a young teaching assistant, Hermann Krüsi, offered to help Pestalozzi. Krüsi already had some practical teaching experience and followed the example set by Pestalozzi. After eight months of teaching, Pestalozzi was evaluated by school authorities who praised him for his progress. In eight months, he had not only taught children of five and six years of age to read perfectly, but also to write, draw and understand arithmetic. The school board promoted Pestalozzi to a mastership in the second boys&#x27; school where he continued his educational experiments.

Fueled by his success, in October 1800 Pestalozzi decided to open another school in Burgdorf, the &quot;Educational Institute for the Children of the Middle Classes&quot;, in the Burgdorf Castle. Here, two educators joined Pestalozzi, Johann Georg Tobler and Johann Christoff Büss. During this time Pestalozzi systemized and codified many of his methods and ideas about education.

==== &quot;How Gertrude Teaches her Children&quot;, 1801 ====
Pestalozzi for the second time in his literary career attracted a wide circle of readers after publishing &quot;How Gertrude Teaches her Children&quot;. The book had a profound impact on the opinion and practice of education. It is written in the form of fourteen letters from Pestalozzi to his friend Heinrich Gessner, a bookbinder in Berne. The first three letters describe how he, Krüsi, Tobler, and Büss came to their present situation at Burgdorf. Letters four to eleven are his reflections and experience in pedagogical instruction and educational theory. The twelfth letter is about physical education while the last two letters talk about moral and religious education. Pestalozzi&#x27;s purpose in these letters was to show that, by reducing knowledge to its elements and by constructing a series of psychologically ordered exercises, anybody could teach their children effectively.

Because of this literary success, people from all parts of Switzerland and Germany came to see the school in Burgdorf. The school grew, but Pestalozzi still felt that he was not doing enough. Though a financial success, the school could not do what Pestalozzi desired: educate the poor. He communicated to the Swiss government that he would like more opportunity to educate the poor. In response it sent two commissioners to investigate his work and, following their favorable review, the government decided to transform Pestalozzi&#x27;s school into a national institution. Staff would receive fixed salaries and money would be spent to publish textbooks written by Pestalozzi and his staff. Using this money, in 1803 Pestalozzi published three elementary books: &quot;The ABC of Sense Perception&quot;, &quot;Lessons on the Observation of Number Relations&quot; and &quot;The Mother&#x27;s Book&quot;.

Two additions were made to Pestalozzi&#x27;s staff during this time: Johann Joseph Schmid (1785–1851) and Johannes Niederer (1779–1843). Schmid had been at the institute as a poor pupil but was added to the staff for his teaching ability. Niederer had formerly been a minister.

Pestalozzi&#x27;s family finally joined him in the institute to live and work. In 1801 Pestalozzi&#x27;s son, Jean-Jacques, died at the age of 31, but his daughter-in-law and grandchild, Gottlieb, moved from Neuhof to Burgdorf to live at the institute.

==== Trip to Paris, 1804 ====
Political changes by Napoleon during this time put Pestalozzi&#x27;s institute in jeopardy through reform in the Swiss government. A national was sent to Paris to interview Napoleon on behalf of Switzerland. Pestalozzi was elected as a member of this deputation. Before going, he published his ideas about political effort. It is a unique document in Pestalozzi&#x27;s work that shows the connection of his political, social and educational influence. Pestalozzi did not enjoy his time in Paris; Napoleon had no interest in his work.

On his return, Pestalozzi found the new Swiss government questioning his right to use the facilities at Burgdorf. They notified him that his services were no longer needed on the grounds that the buildings were needed for their own officials. To avoid being criticized by the public, however, the authorities offered Pestalozzi the use of an old monastery in Münchenbuchsee. Pestalozzi received offers to establish his institute in other towns, but ultimately he decided to accept the Government&#x27;s offer and, in June 1804, Pestalozzi&#x27;s work in Burgdorf ended.

=== Münchenbuchsee, 1804–1805 ===
Pestalozzi&#x27;s stay at Münchenbuchsee was short. Nearby in Hofwil, there was another educational establishment run by Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg. Pestalozzi&#x27;s colleagues convinced him to collaborate with Fellenberg to plan the new institute at Münchenbuchsee. Pestalozzi and Fellenberg did not get along and after months of planning it was decided to move the institute to Yverdon.

=== Yverdon, 1805–1825 ===
By far, the institute at Yverdon was the longest lasting of Pestalozzi&#x27;s endeavors. Pestalozzi spent the first few months of his stay at Yverdon in quiet literary work, thanks to a monetary gift from the King of Denmark, Christian VII. During this time he wrote &quot;Views and Experiences relating to the idea of Elementary Education&quot;.

In July 1805 the institute at Yverdon opened and attracted visitors and pupils from all over Europe. Many governments sent their own educators to study with Pestalozzi with the desire to implement a similar system in their own nations. In May 1807, &quot;Die Wochenschrift fur Menschenbildung&quot;, a newspaper published by the institute, was started by Niederer and regularly included philosophical discussions about education and reports to parents and the public about the institute&#x27;s progress. Some notable changes to the institute at Yverdon were that pupils of any age were educated, not just young children; German, French, Latin and Greek were taught along with geography, natural history, history, literature, arithmetic, geometry, surveying, drawing, writing and singing. At the height of the institution&#x27;s fame Pestalozzi was highly regarded for his work as an educator and in educational reform.

As time went on, Pestalozzi felt that his colleagues were growing farther apart, something he called the . Disagreement had not yet developed into open conflict, but different views about policy were represented by Niederer and Schmid. Niederer had gained influence in the institution and started to add subjects that teachers were not competent to teach. Schmid was open about his criticisms and the division grew among the institute&#x27;s staff. In 1809 and 1810 the criticism was so great that Niederer suggested to Pestalozzi that an impartial commission be brought in from the Government to assess the conduct and efficiency of the institute. Against Schmid&#x27;s wishes, Pestalozzi agreed, and in 1810 the state commissioners visited Yverdon. The commissioners&#x27; report looked favorably upon Pestalozzi&#x27;s ideas but not on the practices of the institute. Any hope of Yverdon becoming a state institution was cut off.

Pestalozzi felt that justice had not been done. Schmid resigned his post and neither Pestalozzi nor Niederer could fill his position as teacher of mathematics, so instead they opened a printing and bookselling business. This proved to be a financial failure, and only through the help of friends was the institute able to stay on its feet until 1815, when Schmid returned. During the period of Schmid&#x27;s absence, Pestalozzi wrote &quot;Swansong&quot;, a restatement of his educational doctrines, and &quot;Life&#x27;s Destiny&quot;, a review of his life&#x27;s work. These were not published until 1826 when they were joined into one book called &quot;Pestalozzi&#x27;s Swansong&quot;. In 1814 he also wrote an article titled &quot;To the Innocent, Serious, and Magnanimous of my Fatherland&quot;, a testimony to the many people living in poverty which his institutions could not reach.

After the death of Pestalozzi&#x27;s wife in 1815, Krüsi resigned from the institute. Niederer followed in 1817. Overcome by troubles, Pestalozzi sought Schmid&#x27;s help. Schmid managed to raise £2,500 by publishing a compilation of Pestalozzi&#x27;s works. The institute remained open for another 10 years, during which time Pestalozzi tried to convince Krüsi and Niederer to return. In 1825 the institute had to be closed due to a lack of funds.

=== Death ===
Pestalozzi returned to his old home at Neuhof and published &quot;Pestalozzi&#x27;s Swansong&quot;. This provoked many bitter responses, by Fellenberg and Niederer in particular. Pestalozzi did not take lightly to these criticisms. He became sick on 15 February 1827, and died two days later in Brugg on 17 February 1827. His last words were, 

The inscription on Pestalozzi&#x27;s grave reads:
&lt;poem&gt;
Heinrich Pestalozzi:
born in Zurich January 12, 1746
died in Brugg February 17, 1827
Saviour of the Poor on the Neuhof.
Preacher to the People in Leonard and Gertrude
In Stans, Father of the orphan,
In Burgdorf and Münchenbuchsee,
Founder of the New Primary Education.
In Yverdon, Educator of Humanity.
He was an individual, a Christian and a citizen.
He did everything for others, nothing for himself!
Bless his name!&lt;/poem&gt;

== Ideas ==
Pestalozzi was a Romantic who felt that education must be broken down to its elements in order to have a complete understanding of it. Based on what he had learnt by operating schools at Neuhof, Stans, Burgdorf and Yverdon, Pestalozzi emphasized that every aspect of the child&#x27;s life contributed to the formation of the child&#x27;s personality, character, and capacity to reason. His educational methods were child-centered and based on individual differences, sense perception, and the student&#x27;s self-activity. He worked in Yverdon to &quot;elementarize&quot; the teaching of ancient languages, principally Latin, but also Hebrew and Greek. In 1819, Stephan Ludwig Roth came to study with Pestalozzi, and his new humanism contributed to the development of the method of language teaching, including considerations such as the function of the mother tongue in the teaching of ancient languages. Pestalozzi and Niederer were important influences on the theory of physical education; they developed a regimen of physical exercise and outdoor activity linked to general, moral and intellectual education that reflected Pestalozzi&#x27;s ideal of harmony and human autonomy.

Pestalozzi&#x27;s philosophy of education was based on a four-sphere concept of life and the premise that human nature was essentially good. The first three &quot;exterior&quot; spheres—home and family, vocational and individual self-determination, and state and nation—recognized the family, the utility of individuality, and the applicability of the parent-child relationship to society as a whole in the development of a child&#x27;s character, attitude toward learning, and sense of duty. The last &quot;exterior&quot; sphere—inner sense—posited that education, having provided a means of satisfying one&#x27;s basic needs, results in inner peace and a keen belief in God.

== Legacy ==
As Pestalozzi said himself, the real work of his life did not lie in Burgdorf or in Yverdon. It lay in the principles of education which he practised, in the development of his observation, in the training of the whole person, and in the sympathetic way of dealing with students, principles and practices which he illustrated in his six months&#x27; labors at Stans. He had the deepest effect on all branches of education, and his influence continues.

Friedrich Fröbel, the creator of the concept of the kindergarten, was a student of Pestalozzi. Pestalozzi&#x27;s ideas inspired Charles Mayo who returned from Switzerland to work with his sister Elizabeth Mayo. Charles had lived with Pestalozzi from 1819 to 1822 at Yverdon. The two siblings were credited with founding the formal education of infant teachers in Britain.

Schools that are named after Pestalozzi include Pestalozzi-Gymnasium Biberach and Pestalozzischule Raunheim in Germany, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi () Elementary School in Skopje, North Macedonia, Colegio Pestalozzi in Argentina, Asociación Colegio Pestalozzi in Peru, and the Johann Pestalozzi Bilingual Academy in Aibonito, Puerto Rico, US. In fact, when the Swiss government joined the international rebuilding effort after the devastating 1963 Skopje earthquake by donating funds for the construction of a school in Skopje, it enrolled the famous Swiss architect to design the new school, equipped it with the first modern application of seismic isolation, and named it after the Swiss pedagogue.

The Pestalozzi-Stiftung Hamburg, created in 1847, runs child day care centers and residential homes.

Pestalozzi&#x27;s method was used by the Old Cantonal School Aarau that Albert Einstein attended, and which has been credited with fostering Einstein&#x27;s process of visualizing problems and his use of &quot;thought experiments&quot;. Einstein said of his education at Aarau, 

The British charity Pestalozzi International sponsors students from developing countries to study in their countries of origin.

Today the Pestalozzi-Fröbel-Haus in Berlin continues to train nursery school teachers.

&quot;Pestalozzianum&quot; in Zürich was named after Pestalozzi and was established in 1875. Based in Zürich, the foundation promoted the school teacher&#x27;s instruction and postgraduate training. In 2003 it was renamed in &quot;Stiftung Pestalozzianum&quot; as its teacher-oriented objectives were integrated in the new model of university-like &quot;Fachhochschule&quot; colleges that was introduced in Switzerland in 2002.

Kinderdorf Pestalozzi in Trogen, Switzerland, was established as a foundation in 1945 to provide the &quot;Kinderdorf&quot; (children&#x27;s village) for war-affected children. In 1946 the foundation stone in the municipality of Trogen in the Canton of Appenzell Ausserrhoden was laid, and in the same year children from war-torn countries settled the first houses. From 1960, in addition to European children, war orphans from Tibet lived at the orphanage, later mostly children from Korea, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Lebanon, and orphans from Switzerland since 1983. The length of stay varies from a few weeks (educational or recreational reasons) up to several years. As of 2012, the projects of the foundation benefited 321,000 children and adolescents in Switzerland and abroad.

The 1989 film &quot;Pestalozzi&#x27;s Mountain&quot; is a biopic about his life and career. Gian Maria Volonté plays the part of Pestalozzi.

<text>Thomas Southerne (12 February 166026 May 1746) was an Irish dramatist.

==Biography==
Thomas Southerne, born on 12 February 1660, in Oxmantown, near Dublin, was an Irish dramatist. He was the son of Francis Southerne (a Dublin brewer) and Margaret Southerne. He had one daughter, Agnes, of whom the mother is unknown.

He attended Trinity College, Dublin, in 1676 for two years. In 1680, he began attending Middle Temple, London, to study law but was drawn away by his interest for theater. By 1682 he was greatly influenced by John Dryden and produced his first play, &quot;The Loyal Brother&quot;, which was performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane by the King&#x27;s Company. Southerne bought his prologue and epilogue from Dryden, who made extra income from his ability to turn such pieces. Despite his friendship with the new playwright, Dryden raised his prices for Southerne&quot;. In 1684, Southerne produced his second play, &quot;The Disappointment, or, The Mother in Fashion&quot; (Kaufman). However, in 1685 Southerne enlisted as an ensign in Princess Anne&#x27;s Regiment of the Duke of Berwick&#x27;s Foot. He rapidly rose to the rank of captain, but his military career came to an end in 1688 at the Glorious Revolution.

The plays Southerne had written before he withdrew from the army would see the light of day, for he returned to theater. On his return, he took on a new form of genre for his writing, &quot;he turned from political allegory to comedy&quot;. In 1690 &quot;Southerne made his first financial profit from his work&quot;. In 1691 he encounters failure with his play,&quot;The Wives Excuse, or, Cuckolds Make Themselves&quot; which was produced by Dury Lane. Thus failure would not stop Southerne, and so in 1693 he wrote another comedy,&quot;The Maid&#x27;s Last Prayer, or, Any Rather Than Fail&quot; which was a success. In 1692 he was blessed with the opportunity by finishing Dryden&#x27;s tragedy, &quot;Cleomenes&quot;. In February 1694 he created the tragicomedy &quot;The Fatal Marriage&quot; which was a huge success and resulted in him being established as a tragic dramatist.

By 1688, &quot;his subject once again ends up in a novel by his colleague Aphra Behn,&quot;Oroonoko&quot;, or &quot;The Royal Slave&quot; was performed as a play and was a huge success&quot;. According to Kaufman, &quot;At the age of sixty-seven Southerne offers one last play, Money The Mistress in 1726, it is a weak conclusion to an honorable career.&quot; He was honored as a playwright. On 26 May 1746, at the age of eighty-seven Southerne died. According to Kaufman, &quot;He was a successful man of the theater, a working playwright for forty-four years.&quot; His best plays, &quot;The Wives Excuse&quot;, &quot;The Fatal Marriage&quot; and &quot;Oroonoko&quot;, reveal a competent, indeed interesting, playwright.

Southerne experimented in a variety of dramatic forms. His contemporaries valued him for his ability to portray intensely emotional scenes and for his &quot;pure&quot; language. He worked in the tradition of Otway, and his tragedies point the way to his successor, Nicholas Rowe. In comedy his subject is the distressed wife, and here he offered a pattern for such playwrights as Vanbrugh, Cibber, Congreve, and Farquhar. Today readers are interested in his psychological realism, his portraits of complex characters, often women in the throes of domestic distress, and his coldly realistic, often harsh, analysis of corrupt societal relations&quot;.

==&quot;Oroonoko&quot;==

Thomas Southerne also wrote the play &quot;Oroonoko&quot;. Southerne&#x27;s play was staged in 1695 and published in 1696, with a foreword in which Southerne expresses his gratitude to Behn and praises her work. One of the major changes that Southerne made to his play from Behn&#x27;s version was that he turned Imoinda&#x27;s skin color from black to white. &quot;She becomes the invisible and reconstructed black female subject in the America&#x27;s cultural discourse&quot;. Southerne plays with the idea of a double plot: one path that deals with the tragic fates of the newly interracial African lovers and the other on Charlotte&#x27;s comical take on finding rich husbands for herself and her sister. Through his double plot, Southerne had hoped to illuminate a &quot;twinned relationship between white women&#x27;s social representation and black women&#x27;s invisibility and lose of agency under colonialism&#x27;s raced visual regimes&quot; (MacDonald). At one point, he puts Imonida in a heroic situation where she drives the governor off with her sword when he tried to rape her. In Southerne&#x27;s play, she fights beside her man during the rebellion with her bow and arrow. She also was the one who used her words to persuade Oroonoko to kill them both and vindicate the honor and the innocence of their love. She was the one who helped guide his knife into her body. Southerne does not speak of the advantages of a white womanhood like most novels during colonialism, but speaks of the unfairness and the treatment of the slaves no matter the color of their skin or gender.

According to T. J. Cribb, Behn mentions that Oroonoko experiences some conflict between his devotion to Imoinda, and his need to rebel, which gives Southerne an opportunity to build Oroonoko&#x27;s character on this conflict, making it a source of the play&#x27;s actions. Behn ends the novel with the brutal death of Oroonoko, but the play written by Southerne ends with the &quot;love death&quot; with Imoinda fulfilling his pact with her. Southerne also emphasizes Oroonoko&#x27;s honor and writes about how Oroonoko gave a speech on justifying slavery in terms of private property and civil contract. Oroonoko speaks of how their owners have paid for them and now they are a part of their estate and they may not like it, but they are no longer individuals, but pieces of property. Southerne expands the idea that even though the harsh treatments, Oroonoko is willing to come to terms with his situation and make it work.

==Other plays==

Thomas Southern&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Persian Prince, or the Loyal Brother&quot; (1682), was based on a contemporary novel. The real interest of the play lay not in the plot, but in the political significance of the personages. Tachmas, the loyal brother, is obviously a flattering portrait of James II, and the villain Ismael is generally taken to represent Shaftesbury.

After leaving his regiment in 1688 he gave himself up entirely to dramatic writing. In 1692 he revised and completed &quot;Cleomenes&quot; for John Dryden; and two years later he scored a great success in the sentimental drama of &quot;The Fatal Marriage, or the Innocent Adultery&quot; (1694). The piece is based on Aphra Behn&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Nun&quot;, with the addition of a comic underplot. It was frequently revived, and in 1757 was altered by David Garrick and produced at Drury Lane. It was known later as &quot;Isabella, or The Fatal Marriage&quot;.

&quot;The Fatal Marriage&quot; is yet another play based on the story of a woman. Like many of his other plays, this too was considered a comedy. Isabella wishes to mourn her lost husband. Isabella finds herself feeling lonely and an outcast from the rest of society. Living in this relatively new world without her husband, Isabella finds herself raped and taken of her innocence by an admirable man in the play who goes by Villeroy. Southerne uses character techniques within Villeroy to display the once innocence of Isabella which enhanced the theme of the play. Southerne was admired for his character technique and was skilled at creating realistic characters and enhancing other characters with the use of newly created personalities. The play was considered to be a tragedy and a serious topic of that time period. Due to the intense tragedy in the play, it became a rather big hit on the stage in which many actresses fought to play the lead role of Isabella and was soon translated from a multitude of languages to be presented on many stages around the world.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;[t]he general spirit of his comedies is well exemplified by a line from &quot;Sir Anthony Love&quot; (1691) &quot;every day a new mistress and a new quarrel.&quot; This comedy, in which the part of the heroine, disguised as Sir Anthony Love, was excellently played by Mrs Mountfort, was his best. He scored another conspicuous success in &quot;Oroonoko, or The Royal Slave&quot; (1696). For the plot of this he was again indebted to the novel by [Aphra] Behn.&quot;

== Later works ==

&quot;The Wives&#x27; Excuse&quot; (1669) was a play Southerne wrote in the late 1660s. a comedy that focused on the idea of a woman trapped in an unhealthy marriage. It was one of its kind in that time period and dramatized a serious, intelligent woman living in a corrupt and unethical society. During this time, divorce was a difficult issue to overcome and go through with. The woman, Mrs.Friendall was dismissed by her husband and later resulted in a liking for her suitor. Overall, the play touches up on the subject of inequality in terms of men in relation to women. At the end of the play, although Mrs. Friendall acted with great dignity after being brought down frequently, she remains stuck in her unwanted marriage while the men in the play seem unaffected by any of the circumstances. As so, &quot;The Wives&#x27; Excuse&quot; did not get too many likings by the public as it seemed like the play may have been too foolish for such a serious topic and was dismissed as stupid and thoughtless.

&quot;The Maid&#x27;s Last Prayer&quot; was yet another unliked piece by society as it was considered too harsh of a subject for the people living in the mid to late 1690s, although it was unliked, it was not necessarily a lack of success. Often in Thomas Southerne&#x27;s plays he depicted woman as greedy, selfish, and likely to commit sin. In this piece, a notable character Lady Trickett is considered to be a dirty, sinful woman unworthy of marriage. The play focuses on women such as Lady Trickett being rejected by a seemingly male-dominated society. As so, the message is clear in the play as it is for that time period, women who were sinful and simply not pure were not worthy of marriage and a happy life.

Southerne&#x27;s later pieces did not achieve any great successes, but he contrived to gain better returns from his plays than Dryden did, and he remained a favourite with his contemporaries and with the next literary generation. He died on 26 May 1746.

His other plays were: &quot;The Disappointment, or the Mother in Fashion&quot; (1684), founded in part on the Curioso Imperlinente in Don Quixote; &quot;The Wives Excuse&quot; (1691), or &quot;Cuckolds make themselves&quot; (1692); &quot;The Maids Last Prayer; or Any rather than fail&quot; (1692); &quot;The Fate of Capua&quot; (1700); &quot;The Spartan Dame&quot; (1719), taken from Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Aegis&quot;; and &quot;Money the Mistress&quot; (1726).

His work was collected as &quot;Plays written by Thomas Southerne, with an Account of the Life and Writings of the Author&quot; (1774).

<doc id="605748" wikidata="Q355567" url="?curid=605748" title="Imperial, royal and noble ranks">
<text>Traditional rank amongst European imperiality, royalty, peers, and nobility is rooted in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Although they vary over time and among geographic regions (for example, one region&#x27;s prince might be equal to another&#x27;s grand duke), the following is a reasonably comprehensive list that provides information on both general ranks and specific differences. Distinction should be made between reigning (or formerly reigning) families and the nobility – the latter being a social class subject to and created by the former.

==Ranks and titles==
===English titles===

During the Middle Ages, in England, as in most of Europe, the feudal system was the dominant social and economic system. Under the feudal system, the monarch would grant land to the monarch’s loyal subjects in exchange for the subject’s loyalty and military service when called by the monarch. Besides grants of land, these subjects were usually given titles that implied nobility and rank, such as duke, earl, baron, etc, which were passed down through the holder’s male line. Barons were the lowest rank of nobility and were granted small parcels of land. Earls were the next highest rank with larger land holdings. Dukes were the highest rank and held the largest holdings, known as duchies. The monarch was the ultimate authority and was able to grant and revoke titles.

In the 14th century, an English peerage began to emerge as a separate entity from the feudal system. The peers held titles granted by the monarch, but did not necessarily hold any land or have any feudal obligations. The peerage was divided into five ranks; from highest to lowest: duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron.

The peerage system became more formalized over time. By the 18th century, peerages were no longer granted as a reward for military service, but instead were granted as a way to recognize social status and political influence.

Today, there are two types of peerages in England: hereditary and life peerages. Hereditary peerages are those that are passed down through the male line of the family. Life peerages, on the other hand, are granted to an individual for their lifetime only and do not pass down to their heirs. 

Before 1958, life peerages were relatively rare, and were held to entitle the bearer to sit in the House of Lords. Since the &quot;Life Peerages Act 1958&quot;, nearly all new peerages are life baronies.

In addition to peerages, there are also a number of other titles in England, such as &quot;knight&quot; and &quot;dame.&quot; These titles are granted by the monarch and are not hereditary.

===Sovereign===
* The word &quot;monarch&quot; is derived from the Greek , &quot;monárkhēs&quot;, &quot;sole ruler&quot; (from , &quot;mónos&quot;, &quot;single&quot; or &quot;sole&quot;, and , &quot;árkhōn&quot;, &quot;archon&quot;, &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;, &quot;chief&quot;, the word being the present participle of the verb , &quot;árkhein&quot;, &quot;to rule&quot;, &quot;to lead&quot;, this from the noun , &quot;arkhē&quot;, &quot;beginning&quot;, &quot;authority&quot;, &quot;principle&quot;) through the Latinized form .
* The word &quot;sovereign&quot; is derived from the Latin (&quot;above&quot;).
* Autocrat is derived from the Greek : (&quot;self&quot;) and (&quot;to hold power&quot;), and may be translated as &quot;one who rules by himself.”

====Common titles for European, Latin American, and Asian monarchs====
Many titles listed may also be used by lesser nobles – non-sovereigns – depending on the historical period and state. The sovereign titles listed below are grouped together into categories roughly according to their degree of dignity; these being: imperial (Emperor/Empress, etc.), royal (King/Queen, Grand Duke, etc.), others (sovereign Prince, sovereign Duke, etc.), and religious.

=====Imperial titles=====
*&quot;Emperor&quot; (in English), &#x27; (in Portuguese), &#x27; (in Spanish), &#x27; (in Italian) and &#x27; (in French), from the Latin , was originally a military title.

**Caesar, the appellation of Roman emperors derived from the Roman dictator Julius Caesar, whose great-nephew and adopted son Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus became the first emperor of Rome. Augustus&#x27; four successors were each made the adoptive son of his predecessor, and were therefore legally entitled to use &quot;Caesar&quot; as a constituent of their names; after Nero, however, the familial link of the Julio-Claudian dynasty was disrupted and use of the word &quot;Caesar&quot; continued as a title only.

**Sapa Inca, The Sapa Inca (Hispanicized spelling) or Sapa Inka (Quechua for &quot;the only Inca&quot;), also known as Apu (&quot;divinity&quot;), Inka Qhapaq (&quot;mighty Inca&quot;), or simply Sapa (&quot;the only one&quot;), was the ruler of the Kingdom of Cusco and, later, the monarch of the &quot;Tawantinsuyu&quot; (called Inca Empire by historians) and the Neo-Inca State.

In the Ottoman Empire, the Grand Vizier held the imperial seal and could convene all other viziers (ministers) to attend to affairs of the state; the viziers in conference were called &quot;Kubbealtı viziers&quot; in reference to their meeting place, the Kubbealtı (&#x27;under the dome&#x27;) in Topkapı Palace.

It was a court title, bestowed by the monarch to the highest military commander, usually reserved for the most influential and most capable among the highest Bosnian nobility. To interpret it as an office post rather than a court rank could be equally accurate, and although it was retained for life by a nobleman who gained it, it was not meant to be hereditary, at least not at first. However, in the last several decades of the Bosnian medieval state it became hereditary, which means it became more than just an office or a court rank. The feminine form is Grand Duchess

===Other sovereigns, royalty, peers, and major nobility===
Several ranks were widely used (for more than a thousand years in Europe alone) for both sovereign rulers and non-sovereigns. Additional knowledge about the territory and historic period is required to know whether the rank holder was a sovereign or non-sovereign. However, joint precedence among rank holders often greatly depended on whether a rank holder was sovereign, whether of the same rank or not. This situation was most widely exemplified by the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) in Europe. Several of the following ranks were commonly both sovereign and non-sovereign within the HRE. Outside of the HRE, the most common sovereign rank of these below was that of Prince. Within the HRE, those holding the following ranks who were also sovereigns had (enjoyed) what was known as an &quot;immediate&quot; relationship with the Emperor. Those holding non-sovereign ranks held only a &quot;mediate&quot; relationship (meaning that the civil hierarchy upwards was mediated by one or more intermediaries between the rank holder and the Emperor).

Exceptional use of &quot;Prinz&quot; was permitted for some morganatic families (e.g., Battenberg, Montenuovo) and a few others (Carolath-Beuthen, Biron von Kurland).

** Heer, a Dutch word meaning &quot;lord&quot;, when used before and during the Dutch Republic, refers to the feudal lords that ran the countryside on behalf of the counts.

The rule of a regent or regents is called a regency. A regent or regency council may be formed ad hoc or in accordance with a constitutional rule. Regent is sometimes a formal title granted to a monarch&#x27;s most trusted advisor or personal assistant. If the regent is holding their position due to their position in the line of succession, the compound term prince regent is often used; if the regent of a minor is their mother, she would be referred to as queen regent.

===Minor nobility, landed gentry, and other aristocracy===
The distinction between the ranks of the major nobility (listed above) and the minor nobility, listed here, was not always a sharp one in all nations. But the precedence of the ranks of a baronet or a knight is quite generally accepted for where this distinction exists for most nations. Here the rank of baronet (ranking above a knight) is taken as the highest rank among the ranks of the minor nobility or landed gentry that are listed below.

====Titles====

* Baronet is a hereditary title ranking below baron but above knight; this title is granted only in the United Kingdom and is variously considered to be &quot;the head of the &quot;nobiles minores&quot;&quot; or &quot;the lowest of the &quot;nobiles majores&quot;&quot; of that country. The feminine form is Baronetess. 
* Dominus was the Latin title of the feudal, superior and mesne, lords, and also an ecclesiastical and academical title (equivalent of Lord)
* Vidame, a minor French aristocrat
* Vavasour, also a petty French feudal lord
* Seigneur or Lord of the manor rules a smaller local fief
* Captal, archaic Gascon title equivalent to seigneur
* Knight is the central rank of the Medieval aristocratic system in Europe (and having its equivalents elsewhere), usually ranking at or near the top of the minor nobility in most areas. However, before the 18th century in the Low Countries of the Holy Roman Empire, the knights (ridderen) were major nobility, ranking above the &quot;heren&quot; (equivalent to feudal barons and lords of the manor, depending on the size of the estate) and directly below the head of state.
* Patrician is a dignity of minor nobility or landed gentry (most often being hereditary) usually ranking below Knight but above Esquire
* Fidalgo or Hidalgo is a minor Portuguese and Spanish aristocrat (respectively; from &quot;filho d&#x27;algo&quot; / &quot;hijo de algo&quot;, lit. &quot;son of something&quot;)
* Nobile is an Italian title of nobility for prestigious families that never received a title
* Edler is a minor aristocrat in Germany and Austria during those countries&#x27; respective imperial periods.
* Jonkheer is an honorific for members of the Dutch nobility who do not currently hold a title. An untitled noblewoman is styled &quot;Jonkvrouw&quot;, though the wife of a &quot;Jonkheer&quot; is a &quot;Mevrouw&quot; or, sometimes, &quot;Freule&quot;, which could also be used by daughters of the same.
* Junker is a German noble honorific, meaning &quot;young nobleman&quot; or otherwise &quot;young lord&quot;.
* Reis is an obscure aristocratic title from the coastlines of Lebanon and Syria that is roughly equivalent to a baron. The word itself can be translated as &quot;Commodore&quot;, and is found only among a few of the former &quot;Merchant Aristocrat&quot; houses of the former Mount Lebanon Emirate. The only legitimate holders of this title are those that trace their lineage back to vassals of Fakhr al-Din II that arrived from Italy via the alliance with the Medici.
* Skartabel is a minor Polish aristocrat.
* Scottish Baron is a hereditary noble dignity, outside the Scots peerage, recognised by Lord Lyon as a member of the Scots &quot;noblesse&quot; and ranking below a Lord of Parliament but above a Scottish Laird in the British system. However, Scottish Barons on the European continent are considered and treated equal to European barons.
* Laird is a Scottish hereditary feudal dignity ranking below a Scottish Baron but above an Esquire
* Esquire is a rank of gentry originally derived from Squire and indicating the status of an attendant to a knight, an apprentice knight, or a manorial lord; it ranks below Knight (or in Scotland below Laird) but above Gentleman.
* Gentleman is the basic rank of landed gentry (ranking below Esquire), historically primarily associated with land; within British Commonwealth nations it is also roughly equivalent to some minor nobility of some of the continental European nations The feminine form is Gentlewoman
* Bibi, means Miss in Urdu and is frequently used as a respectful title for women in South Asia when added to the given name.
* Lord, a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom, or used for people entitled to courtesy titles. The collective &quot;Lords&quot; can refer to a group or body of peers, the feminine is Lady.
* Lalla, is an Amazigh title of respect. The title is a prefix to her given name or personal name, and is used by females usually of noble or royal background.
* Samurai, the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan.
* Jizamurai, (&quot;samurai of the land&quot;) lower-ranking provincial samurai and petty nobility. The term was rather broad and could also refer to non-noble independent peasant landowners.
* Sidi, is a masculine title of respect, meaning &quot;my master&quot; in Maltese, Darija and Egyptian Arabic.
* Dvoryanin, the word (); a member of Russian nobility.

In Germany, the constitution of the Weimar Republic in 1919 ceased to accord privileges to members of dynastic and noble families. Their titles henceforth became legal parts of the family name, and traditional forms of address (e.g., &quot;Hoheit&quot; or &quot;Durchlaucht&quot;) ceased to be accorded to them by governmental entities. The last title was conferred on 12 November 1918 to Kurt von Kleefeld. The actual rank of a title-holder in Germany depended not only on the nominal rank of the title, but also the degree of sovereignty exercised, the rank of the title-holder&#x27;s suzerain, and the length of time the family possessed its status within the nobility (&quot;Uradel, Briefadel, altfürstliche, neufürstliche&quot;, see: German nobility). Thus, any reigning sovereign ranks higher than any deposed or mediatized sovereign (e.g., the &quot;Fürst&quot; of Waldeck, sovereign until 1918, was higher than the Duke of Arenberg, head of a mediatized family, although &quot;Herzog&quot; is nominally a higher title than &quot;Fürst&quot;). However, former holders of higher titles in extant monarchies retained their relative rank, i.e., a queen dowager of Belgium outranks the reigning Prince of Liechtenstein. Members of a formerly sovereign or mediatized house rank higher than the nobility. Among the nobility, those whose titles derive from the Holy Roman Empire rank higher than the holder of an equivalent title granted by one of the German monarchs after 1806.

In Austria, nobility titles may no longer be used since 1918.

<text>Plestiodon multivirgatus, commonly known as the many-lined skink, the northern many-lined skink, or the variable skink, is a medium-sized species of lizard, a member of the North American skink genus &quot;Plestiodon&quot; in the family Scincidae. The species is native to the western United States.

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy of this species is somewhat unclear, even amongst researchers. Most commonly, two subspecies are recognized:
*&quot;P. m. multivirgatus&quot; (Hallowell, 1857) – northern many-lined skink
*&quot;P. m. epipleurotus&quot; (Cope, 1880) – variable skink

The latter is sometimes treated as a separate species &quot;Plestiodon epipleurotus&quot; or &quot;Plestiodon gaigeae&quot; (Taylor, 1935), or given as the subspecies &quot;P. m. gaigeae&quot;. These last two scientific names are in honor of American herpetologist Helen Beulah Thompson Gaige (1890–1976) of the University of Michigan.

&quot;P. m. epipleurotus&quot; is also called the two-lined skink.

==Description==
The many-lined skink is a medium-sized skink reaching a maximum snout-to-vent length (SVL) of about and a total length of roughly . Its body is olive to brown in color. &quot;P. m. multivirgatus&quot; has black stripes along the body and tail, while &quot;P. m. epipleurotus&quot; has two white stripes with black borders.

==Geographic range &amp; habitat==
The geographic range of &quot;P. m. multivirgatus&quot; in the north includes southern South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming, and extends in the south to the Arkansas River in Colorado. &quot;P. m. multivirgatus&quot; prefers sandy soil and occurs in habitat below .

&quot;P. m. epipleurotus&quot; occurs from south-eastern Utah and southern Colorado through Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. It lives in rocky habitat up to elevations of .

==Reproduction==
&quot;P. multivirgatus&quot; is oviparous. Eggs are deposited under rocks.

<text>Kapunda is a town on the Light River near the Barossa Valley in South Australia. It was established after a discovery in 1842 of significant copper deposits. The population was 2,917 at the 2016 Australian census.

The southern entrance to the town has been dominated since 1988 by the statue of Map Kernow (&quot;the son of Cornwall&quot;), a traditional Cornish miner. The statue was destroyed by a fire in June 2006 but was rebuilt.

==History==
Francis Dutton and Charles Bagot, who both ran sheep in the area, discovered copper ore outcrops in 1842. They purchased around the outcrop, beginning mining early in 1844 after good assay results. Mining began with the removal of surface ore and had progressed to underground mining by the end of the year. Copper was mined until 1879. There are also quarries near the town which provide fine marble ranging from dark blue to white. Marble from the Kapunda quarries was used to face Parliament House in Adelaide, and the pedestal of the statue of Venus on North Terrace, Adelaide is made of Sicilian and Kapunda marble.

Ore was initially exported to Swansea in Wales, but later Welsh smelters migrated to South Australia and the ore was smelted locally by 1851. Typically, the miners were Cornish, labourers were Irish and smelter specialists were Welsh. Trade and agriculture were Scottish and English. German farmers and timber cutters at nearby Bethel had already been in the area. Underground mining became more difficult as the mines reached deeper. A steam engine to drive a water pump was installed in 1847, replaced by a larger one in 1851. Mining operations ground to a halt in 1851 with the impact of the Victorian gold rush, restarted in 1855. In 1865, the mine was leased to a Scottish company which switched to open-cut mining methods and replaced the smelters with a different treatment method (cooking the ore with salt to produce copper chloride). Copper prices fell in 1877 and the mine closed in 1879.
A railway from Adelaide was opened in 1860, and extended to Eudunda and Morgan in 1878.

The Corporate Town of Kapunda was established in 1865 to form a local governing body for the township and the District Council of Kapunda was established the following year to govern the surrounds.

The Baptist Church building was constructed in 1866.

Kapunda is known for being the home of Sir Sidney Kidman (1859–1935). He was a major cattle pastoralist who at one time owned 68 properties with a total area larger than the British Isles. He held annual horse sales at Kapunda with up to 3,000 horses sold during the week. His house, &quot;Eringa&quot;, was donated to the Education Department in 1921, and it was used as the administration building for the Kapunda High School until it was gutted by fire on the night of 29 March 2022.

Kapunda was home to several notable manufacturers of farm and mining machinery: Robert Cameron, Joseph Mellors, James Rowe and Adamson Brothers. It was with this last-named company that Tobias Richards, the founder of, TJ Richards &amp; Sons one of Australia&#x27;s largest coach-building firms, started his career. HB Hawke &amp; Co, began in 1857 and operated under various names. The firm closed in 1983.

In the 1850s Irish mine labourers and their families formed a communal settlement on unused land at Baker&#x27;s Flat, south of Kapunda and adjacent to the mine, and successfully resisted attempts from the 1870s by the wealthy landowners to evict them. Although it no longer exists, archaeological digs by Flinders University researchers have revealed the remains of the settlement as having had a population of around 500, and being in the form of a traditional Irish clachan.

Kapunda had a strong Catholic community and Saint Mary MacKillop visited and established a convent there. St John&#x27;s Reformatory for Girls operated from 1897 to 1909.

==Description==

The southern entrance to the town has been dominated since 1988 by the statue of Map Kernow (&quot;the son of Cornwall&quot;), a traditional Cornish miner. The statue was destroyed by a fire on the morning of 1 June 2006 but has since been rebuilt by its creator, Ben van Zetten.

Today, Kapunda is a producer of cereal crops, mainly wheat, barley and oats. Value-added services carried out by local industry include stock feed milling and hay processing. Kapunda is a contributor to the wine-growing industry centred in the nearby Barossa Valley.

The population was 2,917 at the 2016 Australian census.

The Kapunda Historical Society runs a museum housed in the old Baptist Church building.

Kapunda has hosted the Kapunda Celtic Music Festival since 1976.

The town was titled the most haunted town in Australia after a television documentary went to air about this, which led to an increase in the number of tourists that visit the area. The ruins of the Reformatory, located outside the town, were bulldozed for this reason.

The town is close to the historic Anlaby Station with its 23-room homestead, houses, gardens and other buildings on the property, many of which are being restored by its current owners.
==Climate==
Kapunda has a hot-summer mediterranean climate#mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa/Csb), with very warm, dry summers and cool, wetter winters. Temperatures vary throughout the year, with average maxima ranging from in January to in July, and average minima fluctuating between in February and in July. Annual precipitation is somewhat low, averaging between 104.8 precipitation days. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 9 January 1939 to on 9 July 1959. 

==Historic buildings==
===Church===
The second St Rose of Lima Catholic Church, replacing one designed by Edmund Wright and E. J. Woods built in 1866 and subsequently demolished, was built in 1938, to designs by Herbert Jory in Romanesque Revival style, and has been described as &quot;perhaps Jory&#x27;s Romanesque masterpiece&quot;. The Sydney-based magazine &quot;Builder&quot; commented that &quot;the long narrow window openings, infilled with cast cement grilles, the design of which has an Eastern flavour, are an interesting innovation&quot;.

===&quot;Eringa&quot;===

The house which became known as Sir Stanley Kidman&#x27;s home, &quot;Eringa&quot;, was built in 1876 by Alexander H. Greenshields, who named it &quot;Lanark House&quot; after his birthplace, Lanark, in Scotland. Greenshields was a prominent citizen, who built up a drapery business and was a member of many local organisations, as well as the municipal council. The grounds and conservatories of Lanark House occupied nearly . Greenshields died in 1897 and Kidman acquired the property around 1900 and used it as his residence, naming it &quot;Eringa&quot; after one of his properties, Eringa Station. It was damaged by fire in 1902.

After gifting it to Kapunda High School in 1921, the building was originally used as classrooms, then as the library until 2010, and after that as an administration building. The building was heritage-listed, and in 2011–12 the South Australian Government funded a major refurbishment.
On the night of 29 March 2022, the building caught fire, having spread from a nearby transportable classroom building. Eighty firefighters from the Metropolitan Fire Service battled the blaze, but were hampered by a limited water supply, and explosions around the building. The walls were left standing, but there was significant damage to the roof. Staff members were &quot;heartbroken&quot;. Writer Colin Thiele once described the school as &quot;unique&quot;.

==Media==
Kapunda was home to several newspapers. &quot;The Kapunda Herald&quot; (known as the &quot;Northern Star&quot; from 1860 to 1863 and the &quot;Kapunda Herald and Northern Intelligencer&quot; from 1864 to 1878) was printed in the town until 1951, when it was merged with the &quot;Barossa News&quot; to become the &quot;Barossa and Light Herald&quot;.

Another publication, the &quot;Farmers&#x27; Weekly Messenger&quot; (4 April 1874 – 27 September 1878) was also printed in Kapunda by Ebenezer Ward. Within a month, in May 1874, it absorbed another Ward newspaper, &quot;Northern Guardian&quot; (1 April – 6 May 1874), which itself was a continuation of the &quot;Guardian and Northern and North-eastern Advertiser&quot; (19 May 1871 – 28 March 1874) and the short-lived &quot;Gumeracha Guardian and North-eastern Advertiser&quot; (19 March 1870 – 20 October 1870).

The North Kapunda Hotel was featured on television show &quot;&quot;, when cast member Allen Tiller, who was a local at the time, requested to producers, Flame Productions, that Kapunda, known as Australia&#x27;s Most Haunted Town, should be a feature on the show. &quot;Haunting: Australia&quot; aired internationally in 2014.

==Government==
Kapunda is in the state electoral district of Frome (since the 2020 redistribution) and the federal Division of Barker.
Kapunda hosts the meeting chamber and main office of the Light Regional Council.

==Healthcare==
The Kapunda hospital is the main hospital in the Light Valley. However, its birthing and emergency services have intermittently been reported as closed for short periods because of COVID-19 pandemic.

Kapunda Homes, a residential aged care facility, occupies an extension wing of Kapunda Hospital.

<doc id="605783" wikidata="Q1737166" url="?curid=605783" title="Kaurna">
<text>The Kaurna people (, ; also Coorna, Kaura, Gaurna and other variations) are a group of Aboriginal people whose traditional lands include the Adelaide Plains of South Australia. They were known as the Adelaide tribe by the early settlers. Kaurna culture and language were almost completely destroyed within a few decades of the British colonisation of South Australia in 1836. However, extensive documentation by early missionaries and other researchers has enabled a modern revival of both language and culture. The phrase &quot;Kaurna meyunna&quot; means &quot;Kaurna people&quot;.

==Etymology==
The early settlers of South Australia referred to the various indigenous tribes of the Adelaide Plains and Fleurieu Peninsula as &quot;Rapid Bay tribe&quot;, &quot;the Encounter Bay tribe&quot;, &quot;the Adelaide tribe&quot;, the Kouwandilla tribe, &quot;the Wirra tribe&quot;, &quot;the Noarlunga tribe&quot; (the Ngurlonnga band) and the Willunga tribe (the Willangga band).

The extended family groups of the Adelaide Plains, who spoke dialects of a common language, were named according to locality, such as &quot;Kawanda Meyunna&quot; (North men), &quot;Wirra Meyunna&quot; (Forest People), &quot;Pietta Meyunna&quot; (Murray River people), &quot;Wito Meyunna&quot; (Adelaide clan&#x27;s former name), &quot;Tandanya&quot; (South Adelaide people), etc. – but they had no common name for themselves. The name &quot;Kaurna&quot; was not recorded until 1879, used by Alfred William Howitt in 1904, but not widely used until popularised by Norman B. Tindale in the 1920s. Most likely, it is an exonym introduced from the Ramindjeri or Ngarrindjeri word &quot;kornar&quot; meaning &quot;men&quot; or &quot;people&quot;.

&quot;Kaurna meyunna&quot;, meaning Kaurna people, is often used in greetings and Welcome to Country or Acknowledgement of Country ceremonies.

==Language==

Kaurna&#x27;war:a (Kaurna speech) belongs to the Thura-Yura branch of the Pama–Nyungan languages. The first word lists taken down of the Kaurna language date to 1826. A knowledge of Kaurna language was keenly sought by many of the early settlers. William Williams and James Cronk were the first settlers to gain a working knowledge of the language, and to publish a Kaurna wordlist, which they did in 1840. When George Gawler, South Australia&#x27;s third Governor, arrived in October 1838, he gave a speech to the local Indigenous population through a translator, William Wyatt (later third interim Protector of Aborigines), assisted by Williams and Cronk. Gawler actively encouraged the settlers to learn Kaurna, and advocated using the Kaurna names for geographic landmarks.

In October 1838 two German missionaries, Christian Teichelmann and Clamor Schürmann, arrived on the same ship as Gawler in 1838, and immediately set about learning and documenting the language. In December 1839, they opened a school at Piltawodli (in the west Park Lands north of the River Torrens) where the children were taught to read and write in Kaurna. Schurmann and Teichelmann (and later Samuel Klose) translated the Ten Commandments and a number of German hymns into Kaurna, with Schürmann attempting to &#x27;Christianize&#x27; and &#x27;civilize&#x27; the people. Although they never achieved their goal of translating the entire Bible, their recorded vocabulary of over 2,000 words was the largest wordlist registered by that time, and pivotal in the modern revival of the language.

==Territory==

Kaurna territory extended from Cape Jervis at the bottom of the Fleurieu Peninsula to Port Wakefield on the eastern shore of Gulf St Vincent, and as far north as Crystal Brook in the Mid North. Tindale claimed clans were found living in the vicinity of Snowtown, Blyth, Hoyleton, Hamley Bridge, Clarendon, Gawler and Myponga. The stringy bark forests over the back of the Mount Lofty Ranges have been claimed as a traditional boundary between Kaurna and Peramangk people. Tunkalilla Beach (keinari), east of Cape Jervis, is the traditional boundary with the Ramindjeri.

This is the most widely cited alignment of Kaurna territorial boundaries. However, according to Ronald and Catherine Berndt the neighbouring Ramindjeri tribe asserts a historical territory including the whole southern portion of the Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island, extending as far north as Noarlunga or even the River Torrens. This overlaps with a significant portion of the territory claimed by both the Kaurna and the neighbouring Ngarrindjeri to the east. However, linguistic evidence suggests that the Aboriginal people encountered by Colonel Light at Rapid Bay in 1836 were Kaurna speakers. The Berndts&#x27; ethnographic study, which was conducted in the 1930s, identified six Ngarrindjeri clans occupying the coast from Cape Jervis to a few kilometres south of Adelaide. The Berndts posited that the clans may have expanded along trade routes as the Kaurna were dispossessed by colonists.

A main Kaurna presence was in Tarndanyangga (&quot;red kangaroo place&quot;) near the River Torrens and the creeks that flowed into it, an area that became the site of the Adelaide city centre. Kaurna people also resided in the suburb of Burnside, and an early settler of the village of Beaumont described the local people thus:
At every creek and gully you would see their wurlies and their fires at night ... often as many as 500 to 600 would be camped in various places ... some behind the Botanic Gardens on the banks of the river; some toward the Ranges; some on the Waterfall Gully.

===Dispossession===
Although Governors Hindmarsh (1836–1838) and Gawler (1838–1841) had orders to extend the protection of British law to the people and their property, the colonists&#x27; interests came first; their policy of &quot;civilising&quot; and &quot;protecting&quot; the Indigenous people nonetheless assumed a peaceful transfer of land to the settlers. All land was offered up for sale and bought by settlers.

The Lutheran missionaries Christian Teichelmann and Clamor Schurmann studied Kaurna language and culture, and were able to inform the authorities of their exclusive ownership of land inherited through the paternal line. Gawler reserved several areas for the Kaurna people, but the settlers protested and these areas were subsequently sold or leased. Within ten years, all of the Kaurna and Ramindjeri lands were occupied by Europeans. Wild fauna disappeared as European garden practices were introduced and grazing animals destroyed the bulbs, lilies and tubers that the Kaurna had tended for food. Elders no longer had authority; their entire way of life had been undermined.

==Population==
===1790s–1860s===
The Kaurna may have numbered several thousand before European contact, but were down to about 700 by the time of the formal establishment of the colony in 1836. Initially, contacts began with the arrival of sealers and whalers in the 1790s. Sealers established themselves on Kangaroo Island as early as 1806, and raided the mainland for Kaurna women, both for the sexual opportunities and the workforce they could supply in skinning the sealers&#x27; prey. Wary of Europeans from their experience with sealers, the Kaurna generally stayed aloof when the first colonists arrived. The timing was important. Summer was a period when the Kaurna traditionally moved from the plains to the foothills, so that the initial settlement of the Adelaide area took place without any conflict.

The population again severely declined upon the arrival of Anglo-European colonial settlers with South Australia Governor Captain John Hindmarsh as Commander-in-chief in December 1836 at Holdfast Bay (now Glenelg). According to an entry in the &quot;South Australian Register&quot; (30 January 1842), the Kaurna population numbered around 650. They had suffered a serious drop in numbers in the early 1830s (and possibly again in 1889) due to a smallpox epidemic which is thought to have originated in the eastern states and spread along the Murray River as Indigenous groups traded with each other. This devastated their lives in every way. An outbreak of typhoid, due to pollution by Europeans of the River Torrens, lead to many deaths and a rapid population decline, though accurate figures were not recorded. Many contracted other diseases against which they lacked immunity, such as measles, whooping cough, typhus, dysentery and influenza. The groups lost their identities as they merged with others, and the Kaurna and Ramindjeri people were reduced to very few. In the 1840s, Murray River people invaded, stealing women and children, while the government suppressed the Kaurna attempts at self-defence. Some Kaurna moved north to join other tribes.

The Colonisation Commissioners had promised to protect the Aboriginal people and their property as well as making provision for their subsistence, education and advancement, with the post of Protector of Aborigines set up with this aim. William Wyatt was followed by the first official appointment in the role, Matthew Moorhouse, who held the post from 1839 to 1856. He reported in 1840 that many Kaurna were friendly and helpful, and that by 1840, about 150 spoke at least some English. Many Kaurna men, such as Mullawirraburka (&quot;King John&quot;) and Kadlitpinna (&quot;Captain Jack&quot;) helped the police and new settlers, also sharing their language, culture and beliefs with the missionaries. An early settler in Marryatville, George Brunskill, reported that the &quot;local Blacks&quot; were harmless, did not steal, and returned borrowed items promptly. Much goodwill was shown on both sides, but as the settler numbers grew, their drunkenness, violence, exploitation and failure to practise the reciprocity expected in Aboriginal culture soured the relationships.

After a few incidents involving the executions of Aboriginal men after the murders of settlers, sometimes on flimsy evidence, and a blind eye turned to violence against Indigenous people, the situation escalated. The Maria massacre of shipwrecked people on the Coorong led to further violent clashes and harsh penalties were imposed to protect the settlers. Missionaries Teichelmann and Schurmann, Protector Moorhouse and Sub-Protector Edward John Eyre questioned the use of a foreign legal code against the Indigenous peoples, and Moorhouse complained of police hostility towards Aboriginal people, but Governor George Grey stood firm, and martial law was applied even where there had been little previous contact with the settlers.

Moorhouse and Grey gave up trying to settle the local Aboriginal people as farmers, and discouraged settlement at Pirltawardli. The 1847 &quot;Vagrancy Act&quot; restricted their free movement. Teichelmann tried to establish an Aboriginal mission settlement at Happy Valley, about south of Adelaide, but he lacked the means to develop the property or make farming a viable option for the Kaurna. Many Kaurna people worked for the settlers and were well thought of, but the work was seasonal and the rewards inadequate, and their tribal obligations were not understood by their employers. Grey started the use of rations to maintain the peace and to persuade the people to send their children to school.

According to Moorhouse, &quot;almost whole tribes&quot; had disappeared by 1846, and by the 1850s, there were few remaining Kaurna in the Adelaide area. In 1850 the children (mostly from the Murray River area, but including a few Kaurna) at the Native School (which had been on Kintore Avenue since 1846) were transferred to the Poonindie Native Training Institution near Port Lincoln, on the Eyre Peninsula, over away. Moorhouse resigned as Protector in 1856, and in 1857 the position was abolished.

The Kaurna people had to accept colonial domination more quickly than in other regions, and they mostly chose to co-exist peacefully with the settlers. Most, however, resisted the &quot;civilising&quot; policies of the government and the Christian teachings of the missionaries. Being so small in number by the 1850s, some were absorbed into the neighbouring Narungga or Ngarrindjeri groups, and some married settlers.

===1860s–present===
By 1860 the Kaurna were vastly outnumbered by the colonists, who numbered 117,727. Adults were also relocated from the city to places such as Willunga, Point McLeay, and Point Pearce in the 1860s. In 1888 a German missionary reported that there was &quot;scarcely one remaining&quot;. Some of the Kaurna people settled at Point McLeay and Point Pearce married into local families, and full-blood Kaurna still lived at the missions and scattered in the settled districts in the late 19th century, despite the wide belief that the &quot;Adelaide tribe&quot; was extinct by the 1870s.

Rations continued to be supplied in Adelaide and from ration depots in the country. Although the office of Protector was restored in 1861, the government did not play an active role in Aboriginal affairs, leaving their welfare to the missionaries. A Select Committee reported that the race was doomed to extinction. Some Aboriginal people (Kaurna and others) moved around and sometimes visited the city, camping in Botanic Park, then called the Police Paddocks. In 1874, 18 men and women were arrested and charged as &quot;vagrants&quot;, and after a 14 days&#x27; imprisonment were sent back to Goolwa and Milang. Running battles between the police and similar groups continued for decades.

History books about Adelaide have largely ignored the Aboriginal presence, and Womadelaide is held each year in Botanic Park without acknowledgement of the Aboriginal encampments 150 years ago on the same land. There is a tradition of performing corroborees and dances dating back to the 1840s, including the &quot;Grand Corroboree&quot; at the Adelaide Oval in 1885 and corroborees at the beaches of Glenelg and Henley Beach around the turn of the century. This huge omission in the history books has been described as &quot;strategic forgetting&quot; by anthropologist W. E. H. Stanner.

The last surviving person of full Kaurna descent, a woman called Ivaritji (Amelia Taylor or Amelia Savage) died in 1929. Born in Port Adelaide in the late 1840s, her name means &quot;gentle, misty rain&quot; in the Kaurna language. Her father, Ityamai-itpina, known as &quot;Rodney&quot;, was one of the leaders of the Kaurna and prominent in the early settlers&#x27; accounts. She was responsible for identifying locations of cultural significance in the city, such as the lake in the Adelaide Botanic Garden and Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga, and Whitmore Square has been given her name in honour of the prior occupation of the land by the Kaurna people.

==Native title==

Unlike the rest of Australia, South Australia was not considered to be terra nullius. The enactment of the South Australia Act 1834 which enabled the province of South Australia to be established, acknowledged Aboriginal ownership and stated that no actions could be undertaken that would &quot;affect the rights of any Aboriginal natives of the said province to the actual occupation and enjoyment in their own persons or in the persons of their descendants of any land therein now actually occupied or enjoyed by such natives&quot;. Although the Act guaranteed land rights under force of law for the Indigenous inhabitants, it was ignored by the South Australian Company authorities and squatters, who interpreted the Act to mean &quot;permanently occupied&quot;.

In 2000, a group called Kaurna Yerta Corporation lodged a native title claim on behalf of the Kaurna people. The claim covers over of land stretching from Cape Jervis to Port Broughton, including the entire Adelaide metropolitan area. The Ramindjeri people contested the southern portion of the original claim. In March 2018 the determination was made and the Kaurna were officially recognised as the traditional owners of the land from &quot;Myponga to Lower Light&quot;. An Indigenous land use agreement for the area was finalised on 19 November 2018. The agreement was among the South Australian government, the federal government and the Kaurna people, with formal recognition coming after the Federal Court judgement, 18 years after lodgement. This was the first claim for a first land use agreement to be agreed to in any Australian capital city. The rights cover Adelaide&#x27;s whole metropolitan area and includes &quot;17 parcels of undeveloped land not under freehold&quot;. Some of the land is Crown land, some belongs to the state government and some is private land owned by corporations. Justice Debra Mortimer said it would be &quot;the first time in Australia that there [had] been a positive outcome within the area of (native title) determination&quot;.

In 2009, a group called Encompass Technology wrote to the Governor of South Australia on behalf of the Kaurna people, asserting sovereignty over the Marble Hill ruins in the Adelaide Hills, and the Warriparinga Living Kaurna Cultural Centre in Marion, and claiming that they were owed nearly $50 million in rent. The South Australian Government rejected the claim.

==Culture==
The Kaurna people were a hunter-gatherer society, who changed their dwellings according to climatic conditions: in summer they would camp near the coastal springs fishing for mulloway. With the onset of winter, they would retire to the woodlands, often using hollowed out fallen redgums along creeks, with bark extensions as shelters. Sudden downpours could quench their fires, the maintaining of which was old women&#x27;s work, with deadly consequences. At times they would have to impose themselves on otherwise despised tribes, such as the Ngaiawang and Nganguruku to trade goods like their cloaks, quartz flints and red ochre in order to obtain firesticks.

Among their customs was the practice of fire-stick farming (deliberately lit bushfires for hunting purposes) in the Adelaide Hills, which the early European settlers spotted before the Kaurna were displaced. These fires were part of a scrub clearing process to encourage grass growth for emu and kangaroo. This tradition led to conflict with the colonists as the fires tended to cause considerable damage to farmland. In an official report, Major Thomas O&#x27;Halloran claimed the Kaurna also used this as a weapon against the colonists by lighting fires to deliberately destroy fences, survey pegs and to scatter livestock. Due to this regular burning by the time the first Europeans arrived, the foothills&#x27; original stringybark forests had been largely replaced with grassland. Since the late 1960s, restrictions on foothills subdivision and development have allowed regeneration of native trees and bush to a &quot;natural&quot; condition that would not have existed at the time of European occupation.

===Artefacts===
Items of Kaurna material culture, such as traditional objects, spears, boomerangs and nets etc. are extremely rare. Interest in collecting and conserving Kaurna culture was not common until their display at the 1889 Paris Exhibition spurred an interest in Indigenous culture, by which time the Kaurna traditional culture was no longer practised. Many hundreds of objects were sent to the Paris exhibition and these were never returned to Australia.

The Kaurna collection held by the South Australian Museum contains only 48 items. In September 2002, a Living Kaurna Cultural Centre was opened at Warriparinga in the southern suburbs area of Adelaide.

===Tribal organisation===
The Kaurna people lived in family groups called bands, who lived in defined territories called &quot;pangkarra&quot; which were &quot;passed&quot; from father to son upon his initiation. Pangkarra always had access to the coastline and ran extensively inland. The coastline was essential for seafood hunting and the inland territories provided food, clothing and protection for the people during bad weather. The pangkarra were also grouped into larger areas of land called &quot;yerta&quot;.

As all the members of a band were related, marriage between a man and a woman within the same band was forbidden. Bands were patrilineal and patrilocal: a woman always lived with her husband&#x27;s band following her marriage. Each band was also composed of two exogamous moieties, the Karuru and Mattari, which traced their descent matrilineally to an ancestral totemic being. All the children of a marriage would take their mother&#x27;s moiety as children were considered to have &quot;inherited&quot; their &quot;flesh and blood&quot; from their mothers alone. Marriage within the same moiety was forbidden. Girls became marriageable at puberty, usually around 12 years of age. Conversely, men were only allowed to marry after the age of 25.

Sexual relations were relatively free and uninhibited, regardless of marital status. Kaurna ownership of property was communal; the reproductive organs were seen no differently from any other form of property, and thus adultery was practically ubiquitous. The visitation of men from distant tribes was seen as a good opportunity to enhance the gene pool. The practice of &quot;milla mangkondi&quot; or wife stealing was also common, for the same reason. Although this custom was hated by some victims, as arranged marriages were the norm, some women saw it as an opportunity to choose their own partners and actively encouraged a preferred suitor; all Kaurna bands are said to have engaged in the practice regularly.

===Rites and mythology===
Very little is known of Kaurna rites and mythology as colonial written records are fragmentary and rare. Physically, the Kaurna practised chest scarification and performed circumcision as an initiatory rite and were the southernmost Indigenous language group to do so. Waterfall Gully has been linked to initiation rites.

Historical accounts of Kaurna burial rites are unreliable as any gathering of Kaurna was thought to be for a funeral. As soon as a person died the body was wrapped in the clothes they had worn in life. The body was then placed on a &quot;wiralli&quot; (crossed sticks that form the radii of a circle) and an inquest was held to determine cause of death. The body was then buried. Children under four years were not buried for some months, but were wrapped and carried by their mothers during the day with the bundle being used as a pillow at night.
Burial by bodies of water was common with the use of sandy beaches, sand dunes and banks of rivers. A large number of graves have been found on Glenelg beach and at Port Noarlunga.
Similarly, an unusually complex burial at Kongaratti was found. The grave was rectangular and lined with slate, the base was also lined with slate which had been covered with a bed of grass. An elderly woman was lying on her side, draped in a fishing net and wrapped in a Kangaroo skin cloak. The grave was topped with a layer of grass covered by marine sponges.

Similar to a Peramangk dreamtime legend, the Kaurna regard the 35 miles from the Mount Lofty Ranges to Nuriootpa as the body of a giant called Nganno (often pronounced Nunoo) who was killed there after attacking their tribe. The peaks of the Mount Lofty Ranges and Mount Bonython are &quot;jureidla&quot; (conserved in the toponym Uraidla), namely his &quot;two ears&quot;. There are other traditional stories connected to the two peaks Mt Lofty and Mt Bonython, one story concerning two men and another referring to the two moiety groups of the Kaurna. The general theme of these stories surrounding the two peaks is the importance of community and the notion of unselfishness as a practice which supports community.

A legend recounted variously by Unaipon and Milerum concerns a culture hero called Tjilbruke has topographical features that locate it in Kaurna territory. In Tindale&#x27;s version Tjilbruke is associated with the glossy ibis; the name actually refers to the blue crane. The &quot;Tjilbruke Dreaming Tracks&quot; have been mapped from the Bedford Park area (Warriparinga), down the Fleurieu Peninsula, and efforts have been made to preserve and commemorate it where possible.

&quot;Munaitjerlo&quot; is an ancestral being who created the Moon and stars before himself becoming the Sun. The word &quot;Munaitjerlo&quot; was believed by Teichelmann to also refer to the Kaurna Dreamtime itself. The mythology of the Mura-Muras, ancestral beings who created landscape features and introduced laws and initiation, can be found in southwest Queensland, the Northern Territory and in the Flinders Ranges through to Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. As it is known that the Kaurna shared a common Dreaming with these peoples it is likely they shared the Mura-Muras as well. By way of contrast, the travels of Tjilbruke are well known from Norman Tindale&#x27;s research.

===Seasons===

The Kaurna seasonal calendar is divided into four seasons, roughly equivalent to summer, autumn, winter and spring:
*Warltati, the hot season, from January to March (&quot;warlta&quot; = hot, heat and warmth)
*Parnati, the windy season, from April to June (&quot;waitpi&quot; = windy)
*Kudlila, the wet season, from July to September (&quot;kudlinthi&quot; = to wash the earth)
*Wirltutu, the mild warm season, October to December (indicated by the position of &quot;wirltu&quot;, the eagle&#x27;s foot constellation, or Southern Cross, in the sky)

==Cultural revival==
From the 1970s onwards, a number of elders and community leaders led a cultural revival, and were responsible for introducing Kaurna perspectives into the SA education curriculum, establishing the Tjilbruke Dreaming Track and other initiatives. These people included Lewis O&#x27;Brien, Gladys Elphick, Alitya (Alice) Rigney, and Georgina Williams of the South Australian Museum. Much of its Aboriginal Studies curriculum is based on &quot;The Kaurna People&quot; (1989). Many Kaurna people grew up in Bukkiyana (Point Pearce mission) and Raukkan (Macleay mission) and experienced some aspects of Narungga and Ngarrindjeri culture, and gradually started reclaiming Kaurna skills and Dreaming stories.

===Organisations===
The Kaurna Aboriginal Community and Heritage Association (KACHA) is recognised as the representative body for all Kaurna people. Starting life as the Tjilbruke Track Committee based at the South Australian Museum, it was renamed as the Kaurna Heritage Committee before growing into KACHA, which encompasses broader issues than cultural heritage concerns, including rebuilding the language and culture.

The Kaurna Yerta Aboriginal Corporation represents Kaurna people, and was involved in the creation of the Wangayarta memorial park and burial site in 2021.

===Dance===
There are at least two groups of Kaurna traditional dancers in South Australia: 
* Taikurtinna (meaning &quot;family&quot;) group established by Uncle Stevie Goldsmith and since his death led by his son Jamie 
* Kuma Karro (&quot;One Blood&quot;), established in 2008 by Jack Buckskin

==Kaurna place names==

Many places around Adelaide and the Fleurieu Peninsula have names either directly or partially derived from Kaurna place names, such as Cowandilla, Aldinga, Morialta and Munno Para. Some were the names of the Kaurna bands who lived there. There are also a few Kaurna names hybridised with European words.

The Adelaide City Council began the process of dual naming all of the city squares, each of the parks making up the parklands which surround the Adelaide city centre and North Adelaide, and other sites of significance to the Kaurna people in 1997. The naming process, which assigned an extra name in the Kaurna language to each place, was mostly completed in 2003, and the renaming of 39 sites finalised and endorsed by the council in 2012.

==Alternative names==

* &quot;Adelaide tribe&quot;
* &quot;Coorna&quot;
* &quot;Jaitjawar:a&quot; (&quot;our own language&quot;)
* &quot;Koornawarra&quot;
* &quot;Kurumidlanta&quot; (Pangkala term, lit. &quot;evil spirits&quot;)
* &quot;Medaindi&quot; (horde living near Glenelg), Medaindie

==Repatriation of remains==
On 1 August 2019, the remains of 11 Kaurna people were laid to rest at a ceremony led by elder Jeffrey Newchurch at Kingston Park Coastal Reserve, south of Adelaide. John Carty, Head of Humanities at the South Australian Museum, said that the museum was &quot;passionate&quot; about working with the Kaurna people to repatriate their ancestors, and would also be helping to educate the community about what it means to Aboriginal people. The Museum continues to receive further remains of Aboriginal people from overseas museums, in addition to the large amount of remains it already has. While many of these ancestral remains may be returned to Country by their families, who many of these people were is unknown. Due to the large number of remains which continues to grow and that many are unknown, a way to return these ancestors to Country, such as a memorial park, needed to be found.

In 2021, a new burial site was built in the cemetery to accommodate the repatriated remains of Kaurna people, called Wangayarta, in Evanston South. It was designed by a group that included elders Uncle Jeffrey Newchurch, Aunty Heather Agius, Uncle Major &quot;Moogy&quot; Sumner, and many others, and was supported by the Kaurna Yerta Aboriginal Corporation. The memorial site is in the shape of the Kaurna shield, to protect the ancestors now buried there.

In November 2021, the South Australian Museum apologised to the Kaurna people for having held 4,600 Aboriginal remains over the past 165 years, and buried the first 100 remains of their ancestors at the site. A second round of burials took place in June 2022.

==Notable people==
===Jack Buckskin===
Jack Kanya Kudnuitya Buckskin (born ), a Kaurna/Narungga man also known as Vincent Buckskin, who was Young South Australian of the Year in 2011, is a teacher of Kaurna language and culture. 

The impetus for his work stems from when he was just 19, and having become the second in his family to have finished Year 12, and started at university, received the news that his sister Mary, who had moved to Darwin, had committed suicide. Uncle Stevie Goldsmith (see below) invited him to join the Taikurtinna dance group to lift his spirits, and he first danced in public at Festival Plaza, featuring in a Bollywood film called &quot;Love Story 2050&quot;. He has since established his own traditional dance group, Kuma Karro (&quot;One Blood&quot;) in 2008, which has performed nationally and internationally, and has taught dance at Kaurna Plains School. Kuma Kaaru has since evolved into a hub for many local Aboriginal cultural services, employing 12 people who aim to teach both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people about the language, culture diversity of Aboriginal peoples. They work with schools, the South Australian Music Awards, Sydney Swans, and many others.
Buckskin has taught Kaurna language at Warriparinga through the School of Languages; at Salisbury High School; Kaurna Plains School, Le Fevre High School; and at Adelaide High School. He works with Rob Amery on language revival at the University of Adelaide 

A documentary directed by Dylan River and Glynn McDonald, portraying Buckskin&#x27;s engagement with his language and culture, titled &quot;Buckskin&quot;, was released in 2013 and is available on SBS on Demand. In 2018, the City of Port Adelaide Enfield honoured him with an award. 

In 2020, he delivered the Kaurna Welcome to Country for the online theatre series, &quot;Decameron 2.0&quot;, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and acted in a single-actor play by Alexis West in the series.
 Buckskin works at Tauondi Aboriginal College in Port Adelaide as a cultural adviser and mentor, and is frequently called upon to perform Welcomes to Country. He and his partner Khesanh, whom he met while both were attending Salisbury High School, have three children, who have learnt to speak Kaurna at home.

===Uncle Stevie Goldsmith===
Stephen &quot;Gadlabarti&quot; Goldsmith (died July 2017), known as Uncle Stevie, a Kaurna, Narungga, and Ngarrindjeri man, was a respected cultural adviser. He worked at the Kaurna language revival centre at the University of Adelaide, Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi (KWP), and advised the South Australian Museum and the Art Gallery of South Australia.

Uncle Stevie established and danced with the Taikurtinna (meaning &quot;family&quot;) group, and was an accomplished player of the yidaki. He was frequently called upon to deliver Welcomes to Country, including at WOMADelaide and other WOMAD festivals overseas. He also acted on television and stage, including the Adelaide Festival production of &quot;The Secret River&quot;, and appeared in many advertisements.

Goldsmith was honoured at the 2017 Lord Mayor of Adelaide&#x27;s NAIDOC Awards, and awarded Male Elder of the Year. He was a fan of the Adelaide Crows AFL team, and after his death, the team wore black armbands at the Showdown game. After his death, Rob Amery, head of KWP, wrote on his staff web page: &quot;This has been a great loss to the team who relied on Steve for so much - role model, mentor, Kurraka in the Pirltawardli Puppet Show, performer, editor, camera operator, cultural advisor, etc.&quot;. 

In 2018, an award was created in his honour as part of the Ruby Awards – the Stevie Gadlabarti Goldsmith Memorial Award Major Moogy Sumner won the inaugural award, and Art Gallery of South Australia Indigenous art curator Nici Cumpston won the award in 2019.

&quot;Uncle Stevie&#x27;s Classroom&quot; continues in KidZone at WOMADelaide. &quot;The Portrait of Stephen Goldsmith&quot; is a mural Wright Street, Adelaide city centre, by Jimmy C (James Cochran) with Eizabeth Close, painted in 2018. Uncle Stevie&#x27;s son Jamie is a well-known yidaki player and dancer with the Taikurtinna group, who has also been honoured by a mural painted by Jimmy C, in Frank&#x27;s Lane.

===Other notable Kaurna people===
Uncle Major &quot;Moogy&quot; Sumner is a widely respected Ngarrindjeri and Kaurna elder, who mostly works to further Ngarrindjeri culture.

Other notable Kaurna people include:
* Gladys Elphick (1904–1988), founding president of the Council of Aboriginal Women of South Australia
* Ivaritji (c.1849–1929), probably the last person of full Kaurna ancestry, last known speaker of the Kaurna language before its revival 
* Lewis O&#x27;Brien (born 1930), elder and advocate
* Alitya (Alice) Rigney (1942–2017), scholar and linguist
* Georgina Williams, who did a lot of work for the Tjilbruke Dreaming Track, and who was a finalist in the 2021 NAIDOC Awards

<text>Powder blue is a pale shade of blue.
As with most colours, there is no absolute definition of its exact hue. Originally, &quot;powder blue&quot;, in the 1650s, was powdered smalt (cobalt glass) used in laundering and dyeing applications, and it then came to be used as a colour name from 1894.

Smalt has a deep, dark blue hue, but powder blue nowadays is a pale cobalt blue as illustrated by the examples below, which show powder blue as defined by British and Australian Standards for paint colours along with an example of one manufacturer&#x27;s actual Powder Blue paint, and a consensus definition produced by an online colour names survey in which 140,000 people took part. The sources differ on how pale or saturated a colour it is, but broadly agree on the hue.

&quot;Powder blue&quot; was also used as a colour name in English in 1774, but the exact colour is unclear: it may be a blue-grey or a dark unsaturated blue.

==Web colour==
In contrast to the above examples, the list of X11 color names defines &quot;powderblue&quot; as a pale cyan shade, RGB(176,224,230). This is the colour displayed by a web browser if &quot;color=powderblue&quot; is specified in CSS. However the use of such colour names in stylesheets is deprecated, with the W3C standards body itself saying, &quot;it is often hard to imagine what each name will look like&quot;.

==Crayola colour==
Displayed adjacent is the colour that is called &quot;powder blue&quot; in Crayola crayons. This colour was introduced for the Colors of Kindness set in 2022.

<text>Procida (; ) is one of the Phlegraean Islands off the coast of Naples in southern Italy. The island is between Cape Miseno and the island of Ischia. With its tiny satellite island of Vivara, it is a (municipality) of the Metropolitan City of Naples, in the region of Campania.

==Etymology==
The island derives its name from the Latin name &quot;Prochyta&quot;. Προχύτη/Prochýtē means &#x27;poured out&#x27; in Ancient Greek. According to another theory, &quot;Prochyta&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek verb &quot;prokeitai&quot;, meaning &#x27;it lies forth&#x27;, because of the appearance of the island seen from the sea.

==Geography==
Procida is located between Capo Miseno and the island of Ischia. It is less than . Its coastlines, very jagged, are . The &quot;Terra Murata&quot; hill is the highest point on the island ().
Geologically, Procida was created by the eruption of four volcanoes, now dormant and submerged.

==History==

===Ancient history===
Some Mycenaean Greek objects from the 16th to 15th centuries BC have been found on Procida. Traces have also been found on Vivara, an islet off the southwest coast of Procida. The first historically attested Greek settlers arrived from the Aegean to this island during the 8th century BC, followed by other Greeks of Magna Graecia coming from nearby Cuma.

The island is mentioned by the Roman satirist, Juvenal, in Sat. 3, 5, as a barren place. Later, during Roman rule, Procida became a renowned resort for the patrician class of Rome.

===Middle Ages===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine reconquest in the Gothic Wars, Procida remained under the jurisdiction of the Duke of Naples. The continual devastation first by the Vandals and Goths, and later by the Saracens, pushed the population to resettle in a fortified village typical of medieval times. The population was sheltered by a cape, naturally defended by walls that peaked on the sea that were later fortified, thus acquiring the name of &quot;Terra Murata&quot; (&quot;walled land&quot;).

Testimonies from this period are from those who staffed the watchtowers on the sea, which became the symbol of the island. With the Norman conquest of Southern Italy, Procida experienced feudal dominion; the island, with a mainland annexe (the future Mount of Procida), came under the control of the Da Procida family which continued to hold the island for more than two centuries. The most famous member of the family was John III of Procida, counsellor to Emperor Frederick II and leader of the revolt of the Sicilian Vespers.

In 1339, the fiefdom, together with the Island of Ischia, was handed over to the Cossa family, of French origin, loyal followers of the Angevin dynasty then reigning in Naples. Baldassare Cossa was elected Antipope in 1410 with the name of John XXIII. In this period a deep economic transformation of the island began, as agriculture was slowly abandoned in favour of fishing.
===Modern era===
During the rule of Charles V, Emperor of Spain, the island was granted to the D&#x27;Avalos family. Pirate raids continued during this period. Particularly notable was one in 1534, led by the infamous Turk admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa.

In 1744, King Charles III of Spain made Procida a royal game reserve. In this period the Procidan fleet reached its zenith, backed by a period of flourishing shipbuilding. The population rose to approximately 16,000. In 1799, Procida took part in the revolts that led to the proclamation of the Neapolitan Republic. With the return of the Bourbon dynasty a few months later 12 Procidans were beheaded.

The Napoleonic Wars brought several episodes of devastation due to the island&#x27;s strategic position in the naval engagements between the French and the English. In 1860, after the fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the island became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy.
=== 20th century===
The 20th century saw a crisis in Procidan shipbuilding due to competition with industrial conglomerates. In 1907 Procida lost its mainland territory, which became independent and is commonly called the Mount of Procida (Monte di Procida).

In 1957, the first underwater aqueduct in Europe was built in Procida.

In the last few decades, the population has slowly begun to grow. The economy remains in great part tied to the marine industry, although the tourist industry has also grown.

==Culture==
Several writers have set their novels in Procida. These include &quot;Graziella&quot; written by Alphonse de Lamartine, who came to Procida from Bourgogne at the beginning of the 19th century while in the French army; and &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Island&quot; (1957) by Elsa Morante.

Procida has been chosen as a film set for numerous films (more than 30 films) including &quot;The Postman&quot; and &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;. Procida was also the site of filming for scenes in &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Specifically, the harbour of Procida was shown in scenes related to Cleopatra&#x27;s barge, which was intended to represent the harbour of the ancient city of Tarsus in Asia Minor. In anachronistic Hollywood fashion, the baroque dome of the church in Procida can be seen in the background as the golden Egyptian barge of Cleopatra is docking in the port.
In 2013, Fabrizio Borgogna launched the Procida Film Festival, an international contest for young movie directors, writers and lovers.
===Folklore and traditions===
There are many religious traditions on the island tied to the period of Holy Week before Good Friday. The most evocative of these are the Procession of the Apostles of Holy Thursday and the Procession of the Mysteries of Good Friday. The last one is based on a tradition going back to the end of the 17th century. In the procession, the young males of the island, dressed in the traditional dress of the &quot;Confraternity of the Turchini&quot;, carry allegorical wagons (called &quot;mysteries&quot;) of religious character for a fixed distance, from the village of Torre Murata to the port of Marina Grande. The &quot;mysteries&quot;, often highly artistic, are prepared by the young people and generally, nobody except them would have, at least in theory, seen them before the procession. After the procession, they are taken apart or destroyed.

Every summer, there is an election of the &quot;Graziella&quot; (&quot;Little Graceful&quot;), a young woman that wears the customary clothes of the island, referring to the history told in Alphonse de Lamartine&#x27;s novel, &quot;Graziella&quot;. Also during the summer, a literary award dedicated to Elsa Morante and her novel, &quot;Arthur&#x27;s Island&quot;, is presented.

=== Italian Capital of Culture 2022 ===
Procida has been chosen from among several Italian candidate cities to be the Italian Capital of Culture 2022. On 18 January 2020, the Italian Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism, Dario Franceschini announced the reasons that led to this choice: the cultural project has well-structured local and regional public and private support, giving importance to the heritage and landscape dimension of the place. 

In relation to this, the artisanal dimension has been emphasised, given by the small workshops that characterise the tradition of the Mediterranean islands. The project encompasses characteristics such as authenticity, sustainability of development, culture of the islands and coastal areas of the Bel Paese.

<doc id="605792" wikidata="Q7043865" url="?curid=605792" title="No. 8 Squadron RAF">
<text>Number 8 Squadron (sometimes written as No. VIII Squadron) of the Royal Air Force last operated the Boeing E-3D Sentry AEW1 (AWACS) from RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. As of 2020, the RAF AWACS fleet was made up of three Sentry AEW1s, down from seven originally ordered in the late 1980s. Pursuant to the 2021 defence review, the E-3D Sentry aircraft made its final flight in U.K. service in August 2021.

It was announced in July 2019 that from the early 2020s the squadron will be the first to operate the Boeing E-7 Wedgetail AEW1, the planned replacement for the RAF&#x27;s E-3D Sentry fleet. The squadron was to reform at RAF Lossiemouth in 2024 but service entry was reported as likely in late 2025.

==History==

===First World War===
As No. 8 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) it was formed at Brooklands, Surrey on 1 January 1915, equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c. The squadron moved to Fort Grange, Gosport later on 6 January for further training, and crossed to France on 15 April 1915 to St-Omer. While its main equipment was the B.E.2c, it also operated a fighter flight between May 1915 and early 1916 equipped with a mixture of aircraft, including the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.8 and the Bristol Scout, while it also evaluated the prototype Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.9, a modified B.E.2 that carried the observer/gunner in a nacelle ahead of the aircraft&#x27;s propeller.

Operating from airfields near Saint-Omer, the squadron was initially used for bombing and long-range reconnaissance, carrying out flights of up to behind the front lines. In February 1916 it moved to Bellevue and specialised in the Corps Reconnaissance role, carrying out contact patrols and artillery spotting in close co-operation with the army. The squadron flew in support of the Battle of the Somme in the summer of 1916 and the Battle of Arras in April–May 1917. It received the improved B.E.2e from February 1917, but despite this, losses were heavy as all marks of B.E.2 were outclassed. Armstrong Whitworth FK.8s replaced the B.E.2s in August 1917.

In June 1918, No 8 Squadron, part of the Royal Air Force since 1 April 1918 and commanded by Major T. Leigh-Mallory, was allocated to the Tank Corps, flying contact patrols in support of the Tank Corps attacks during the Battle of Amiens, and becoming expert in spotting and destroying German anti-tank guns. The FK.8s and some tanks were equipped with wireless sets, although wireless communications between tanks and aeroplanes remained at a very basic stage for the rest of the war.

On 12 August 1918, Captain Ferdinand West of 8 Squadron was flying a F.K.8 on a contact patrol when he was attacked by seven German fighters. Despite a severe leg wound, West managed to manoeuvre his aircraft so that his observer could drive off the attacking fighters, before making a forced landing behind Allied lines and insisting in reporting the results of the flight. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for this action.

In December 1918, a few weeks after the Armistice with Germany that ended the First World War, the Squadron re-equipped with Sunbeam Arab-engined Bristol F.2 Fighters. It served briefly in Germany as part of the British Army of Occupation, before moving back to the United Kingdom in July 1919 and disbanding on 20 January 1920.

===Reformation===
8 Squadron reformed at Helwan, near Cairo, Egypt, as a day-bomber squadron equipped with the Airco DH.9A on 18 October 1920. It moved to Basra, Iraq in the Air Policing role, with the security of Iraq the responsibility of the RAF, in February 1921. The squadron was deployed to Kirkuk in July 1922, where it operated against a Kurdish rebellion and Turkish infiltration, and helping to evacuate forces allied to the British from the city of Sulaymaniyah in September 1922. In November–December 1923 the squadron was deployed against Marsh Arabs in the Mesopotamian Marshes.

In February 1927, in response to unrest in Aden, 8 Squadron was deployed to RAF Khormaksar, where it continued in the air policing role. The squadron replaced its elderly DH.9As with new Fairey IIIF light bombers from January 1928. It flew operations against Zaidi in February 1928 and against the Subaihi tribe, who were refusing to pay taxes and revolting, from January to March 1929. Operations against the Subaihi involved destroying crops with incendiary bombs and bombing villages after giving warning so they could be evacuated. This pressure eventually forced the Subaihi to sue for peace, with the rebel chiefs paying fines. More peaceful operation carried out by the squadron included survey flights, casualty evacuation and carrying mail, while the squadron carried out a long-distance return trip from Aden to Cairo and back in 1932.

In April 1935, it re-equipped again with Vickers Vincents, a general purpose aircraft based on the Vickers Vildebeest biplane torpedo bomber replacing the Fairey IIIFs. The squadron started to receive Bristol Blenheim twin-engined monoplane bombers in April 1939, but it retained a flight of Vincents for operations over the rough interior of the Aden Protectorate.

===Second World War===
On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and France. No 8 Squadron flew its first combat missions of the war on 12 June, when nine Blenheims bombed an airfield at Assab in Italian-occupied Eritrea, across the Red Sea from Aden, with 5 Vincents attacking the same airfield that night. On 5 August 1940, Italy invaded British Somaliland, and 8 Squadron&#x27;s Blenheims flew missions against advancing Italian troop columns. The Italians heavily outnumbered the British and Commonwealth defences, and the port of Berbera was occupied by the Italians on 19 August.

The squadron&#x27;s long association with the Middle East gave rise to the adoption of the Arabian Khanjar as the unit&#x27;s badge. The unit continued to be based at RAF Khormaksar in Aden equipped with Bristol Blenheims. Vickers Wellington XIIIs were flown from December 1943 until May 1945.

===Post-War (1945–1971)===
On 15 May 1945 No. 8 Squadron was reformed by renumbering No. 200 Squadron at RAF Jessore in India. Consolidated Liberator VIs were flown. The squadron again disbanded on 15 November 1945.

The unit was reformed at Khormaksar on 1 September 1946 by renumbering No. 114 Squadron and the role of fighter bomber was adopted, initially with de Havilland Mosquito FB.6 aircraft. These were replaced by the Hawker Tempest, and the Bristol Brigand. These fighter was supported by Anson C.19s and Auster AOP.6&#x27;s. Jet equipment was received in 1953 with the de Havilland Vampire FB.9. Continued updating of equipment brought the de Havilland Venom FB.1 and FB.4 and the Hawker Hunter, flown from 1960 until 1971. The squadron disbanded on 21 December 1971.

===Shackletons and Sentries (1972–2021)===

The squadron reformed at RAF Kinloss on 1 January 1972 in the Airborne Early Warning (AEW) role using Avro Shackleton AEW.2s. It moved to RAF Lossiemouth on 14 August 1973, where it stayed until 1991 when it moved to RAF Waddington near Lincoln and re-equipped with Boeing E-3 Sentry. The first Sentry was handed over to the RAF on 26 March 1991 and the last (No. 7) was handed over during May 1992. The squadron was deployed over the Balkans in the early 1990s; it also saw action over Iraq in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2010 and was then involved in Operation Ellamy in 2011 during the Libyan Civil War.

In early 2015, No. 8 Squadron deployed with two Sentries to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, to participate in Operation Shader. 

Two Sentries (&quot;ZH101&quot; and &quot;ZH103&quot;) deployed to RAF Akrotiri in late May/early June 2021 to support Carrier Strike Group 21 as it passed through the Mediterranean Sea. The E-3D&#x27;s final operational sortie was carried out on 30 July, with &quot;ZH103&quot; returning to Waddington on 2 August followed by &quot;ZH101&quot; on 4 August. The Sentry AEW1s were officially retired by the RAF on 28 September 2021.

== Future ==

It was announced in July 2019 that from the mid-2020s the squadron will be the first to operate the Boeing E-7 Wedgetail, the planned replacement for the RAF&#x27;s E-3D Sentry fleet.

<doc id="605799" wikidata="Q2142742" url="?curid=605799" title="Emilio Largo">
<text>Emilio Largo is a fictional character and the main antagonist from the 1961 James Bond novel &quot;Thunderball&quot;. He appears in the 1965 film adaptation, again as the main antagonist, with Italian actor Adolfo Celi filling the role. Largo is also the main antagonist in the 1983 unofficial James Bond movie &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, a remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot;. In &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, the character&#x27;s name, however, was changed to Maximillian Largo and he was portrayed by the Austrian actor Klaus Maria Brandauer.

==Biography==
Fleming describes Largo as a ruthless Neapolitan black marketeer and fence who moved to riskier and more profitable ventures on the international crime scene after five years smuggling from Tangiers and five years of masterminding big jewel robberies on the French Riviera. He is supposedly the last survivor of a once famous Roman family whose legacy he inherited. Largo eventually became the second-in-command of the terrorist organisation SPECTRE. In the film, Largo is &quot;No. 2&quot; and head of extortion operations. In the novel, Largo is &quot;No. 1&quot;; however the numbers are rotated every month as a security precaution, although Largo is the successor to Ernst Stavro Blofeld and the Supreme Commander of &quot;Plan Omega&quot;.

Largo&#x27;s two main headquarters are located in the Bahamas. The first is his estate, called Palmyra, which houses a giant swimming pool filled with sharks; Bond is thrown into this pool but he is able to escape. The second is Largo&#x27;s private yacht, the &quot;Disco Volante&quot;. The yacht is a hydrofoil craft purchased with SPECTRE funds for £200,000. The craft plays a pivotal role in the seizure and transportation of the two nuclear weapons.

To Largo, failure is punishable by death. When Quist, one of Largo&#x27;s henchmen, fails to kill Bond, Largo has him thrown into his pool of sharks. Largo also has little consideration even for those closest to him, going so far as to torture his own mistress, Domino, when he finds out she is betraying him.

One of Largo&#x27;s henchmen, Ladislav Kutze, helps Domino get free, allowing Domino to do what she wanted Bond to do: kill Largo. When Largo gets the upper hand over Bond, Domino shoots him in the back with a spear gun. Largo dies and collapses onto the controls of the &quot;Disco Volante&quot;, jamming them. Bond, Domino, and Kutze all evacuate the &quot;Disco Volante&quot; seconds before the ship collides with rocks and explodes.

==Scheme==
Largo&#x27;s scheme in &quot;Thunderball&quot; involves the theft of two nuclear weapons from NATO at sea to which he would then use to hold the world hostage by threatening to detonate the two devices in Britain or the United States unless they paid the ransom of £100 million British pounds. This scheme has been used countless times since &quot;Thunderball&quot; and is even a joke in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series of movies.

The basic concept of Largo&#x27;s scheme in &quot;Thunderball&quot; is held over in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. As in &quot;Thunderball&quot;, the scheme involves obtaining two nuclear warheads, this time stealing them directly from a United States Air Force base in the UK and holding the world hostage.

==Appearance and personality==
In the novel he is depicted as a large, muscular, olive-skinned, powerful man exuding animal charm, with the profile of a Roman emperor, hooked nose, long sideburns and hairy hands which are likened to crawling tarantulas. Indeed, Emilio Largo&#x27;s surname means &quot;play slowly and broadly&quot;. Adolfo Celi strongly resembles his literary counterpart in the film adaptation. However, his white hair contrasts with the pomaded black hair that Fleming specified in the novel, and he wears a black eye patch over his left eye for reasons that remain unexplained. His powerful influence and command is exhibited at the beginning of the film when a traffic warden begins to protest against Largo&#x27;s parking in Paris but quickly corrects himself when he sees Largo step out of his Ford Thunderbird on the way to a SPECTRE meeting. Like Count Lippe, Umberto Eco describes Largo as handsome and personable, but also vulgar and cruel. Christoph Lindner describes Largo as a &quot;vicarious figure&quot;.

Celi&#x27;s voice was dubbed by Robert Rietty (who previously dubbed the voice of John Strangways in &quot;Dr. No&quot; and later a man resembling Ernst Stavro Blofeld, in &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;).

==Legacy==
With his status as SPECTRE&#x27;s second in command, Largo and his appearance inspired Robert Wagner&#x27;s character &quot;Number Two&quot; in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; films.

<text>Alkaline mucus is a thick fluid produced by animals which confers tissue protection in an acidic environment, such as in the stomach.

== Properties ==
Mucus that serves a protective function against acidic environments generally has a high viscosity, though the thickness and viscosity of the mucus layer can vary due to several factors. For example, alkaline mucus in the stomach increases in thickness when the stomach is distended. The pH level of the mucus also plays a role in its viscosity, as higher pH levels tend to alter the thickness of the mucus, making it less viscous. Because of this, invading agents such as &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, a bacterium that causes stomach ulcers, can alter the pH of the mucus to make the mucus pliable enough to move through. Exposure to atmospheric air also tends to increase the pH level of alkaline mucus.

== In humans ==
In humans, alkaline mucus is present in several organs and provides protection by way of its alkalinity and high viscosity. Alkaline mucus exists in the human eye, stomach, saliva, and cervix.

In the stomach, alkaline mucus is secreted by gastric glands in the gastric mucosa of the stomach wall. Secretion of alkaline mucus is necessary to protect the mucous membrane of the stomach from acids released during digestion. Ulcers can develop as a result of damage caused to the gastric mucosal barrier. Duodenal ulcers have been shown to develop in sites that are in direct contact with pepsin and acids. To prevent damage and protect the mucus epithelium, alkaline mucus secretions increase in the digestive system when food is being eaten.

In the cervix, alkaline mucus has been shown to possess bactericidal properties to protect the cervix, uterus, peritoneal cavity, and vagina from microbes.

<doc id="605810" wikidata="Q16933744" url="?curid=605810" title="Shakespearean problem play">
<text>In Shakespeare studies, the problem plays are plays written by William Shakespeare which are characterized by their complex and ambiguous tone, which shifts violently between more straightforward comic material and dark, psychological drama. Shakespeare&#x27;s problem plays eschew the traditional trappings of both comedy and tragedy, and are sometimes cited as early predecessors to the tragicomedy. 

The term was coined by critic F. S. Boas in &quot;Shakespeare and His Predecessors&quot; (1896). Boas&#x27; use of the phrase was derived from a type of drama that was popular at the time of his writing, most commonly associated with the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. In these problem plays, the situation faced by the protagonist is put forward by the author as a representative instance of a contemporary social problem. The term can refer to the subject matter of the play, or to a classification &quot;problem&quot; with the plays themselves.

As Boas used it, the term &quot;problem play&quot; was originally used to refer exclusively to three plays that Shakespeare wrote between the late 1590s and the first years of the seventeenth century: &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;. Some critics include other plays that were not enumerated by Boas, most commonly &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. The term has been variously applied to other odd plays from different points in Shakespeare&#x27;s career, as the notion of a problem play remains somewhat vaguely defined, and its use as a classification is still not accepted by all Shakespeare critics.

==As conceived by Boas==

Boas himself lists the first three plays and adds that &quot;Hamlet&quot; links Shakespeare&#x27;s problem-plays to his unambiguous tragedies. For Boas, this modern form of drama provided a useful model with which to study works by Shakespeare that had previously seemed uneasily situated between the comic and the tragic; nominally two of the three plays identified by Boas are comedies, while the third, &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, is found amongst the tragedies in the First Folio, although it is not listed in the &quot;Catalogue&quot; (table of contents) of the First Folio. According to Boas, Shakespeare&#x27;s problem-plays set out to explore specific moral dilemmas and social problems through their central characters.

Boas contends that the plays allow the reader to analyze complex and neglected topics. Rather than arousing simple joy or pain, the plays induce engrossment and bewilderment. &quot;All&#x27;s Well that Ends Well&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; have resolutions, but &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; do not. Instead Shakespeare requires that the reader decipher the plays. Per Boas, these plays, distinguished by their themes and treatment, require classification beyond comedy; adopting the popular classification of his time, he called them problem plays.

==Other conceptions==
Author Neil Rhodes argues that the defining characteristic of the Shakespearean problem-play is its controversial plot, and as such, the subgenre of problem-plays has become less distinct as scholars continue to debate the controversies in Shakespeare&#x27;s straightforward tragedies and comedies. What differentiates plays like &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; from Shakespeare&#x27;s explicitly comedic or tragic plays is that it presents both sides of a contentious issue without making a judgement for the audience. Rhodes goes on to claim that this offering of the merits of both sides of the social dispute is a rhetorical device employed but not originated by Shakespeare. Rather, the rhetorical practice of submitting a thesis with a counter-contention that is just as persuasive began in Ancient Greece. Per Rhodes, Shakespeare&#x27;s problem-plays must address a social issue that can reasonably be debated, ranging from gender roles to institutional power frameworks.

Another scholarly analysis of Shakespeare&#x27;s problem-plays by A.G. Harmon argues that what the problem-plays have in common is how each consciously debates the relationship between law and nature. Many of the problem-plays address a disorder in nature, and the characters attempt to mitigate the disorder in varying manners. In four of the plays that Harmon categorizes as problem-plays, &quot;The Merchant of Venice,&quot; &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well,&quot; &quot;Measure for Measure,&quot; and &quot;Troilus and Cressida,&quot; the social order is restored when faulty contracts are properly amended. Harmon&#x27;s conception of the problem-plays differs from others in that he argues that the problem-plays offer a resolution to their respective stories. Much like the characters in the plays must fulfill their contracts, he argues, Shakespeare fulfills his contract as a playwright by providing resolution. Though Harmon&#x27;s conception of the problem-plays does not align with the common understanding of Shakespeare&#x27;s problem-plays, he does provide examples of the social dilemmas that Shakespeare addresses through these plays. The common social problem, per Harmon, is the tension between laws establishing order and the natural tendencies of humans. The problem-plays follow a formula: the established laws of society are challenged, chaos reigns over society, chaos is vanquished by the institution of a new order.

From the perspective of scholar Ernest Schanzer, a Shakespearean problem-play is first defined independently of the idea of a Shakespearean play and only by what the phrase &quot;problem play&quot; itself necessitates. Schanzer chooses to consider only ethical dilemmas in the definition of &quot;problem,&quot; excluding psychological, political, social, and metaphysical problems that may develop. He concludes that problem plays are classified by a pivotal ethical dilemma that instigates multiple opposing but equally plausible opinions from the audience. Using this theory, Schanzer distinguishes only &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; as a Shakespearean problem comedy, identifying both &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; and &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; as lacking of a pivotal ethical dilemma that divides the audience. Schanzer offers &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; in the place of previously recognized problem plays.
