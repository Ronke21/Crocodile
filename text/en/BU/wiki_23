<text>The Home Guard – National Security Forces () is a military reserve force of the Swedish Armed Forces. It was formally established on May 29, 1940, during World War II upon popular demand. While originally composed of former militia groups, today it comprises half of the Swedish Army, thus constituting the basis of the territorial defence of Sweden.

The Home Guard consists mainly of local rapid response units, numbering 17,000 of the 22,000 total Home Guard strength, organised in 40 battalions, with 23 associated auxiliary defence organisations. Most soldiers maintain a civilian job while serving the army part-time. Rapid response units were formed in the early 2000s in parallel to the Swedish government&#x27;s abolishment of conscription to the Swedish Armed Forces; small-scale conscription has since been reintroduced.

The Chief of Home Guard is the commanding officer of the Home Guard, representing 40,000 present and veteran soldiers, reporting directly to the Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces.

==History==
The establishment of the Home Guard was passed into law by the Riksdag on May 29, 1940, after the beginning of World War II, however, units had already been formed by the military before this. Home Guard units were groups of usually eight to 15 men that were to serve as defence units in case of war, located in towns and in both private and state-owned factories, throughout all of Sweden. Members of these small units usually consisted of former professional military men who were equipped with rifles, machine guns, ammunition, medicine, uniforms, and had the option of buying additional materials such as skis, sweaters and marching boots. An additional group, called the Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization, helped with additional tasks that the Home Unit was unable to perform themselves. The Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization helped provide the home unit with additional items such as socks, scarves and gloves as well as performing all administrative work that the unit could not afford to do themselves. In case of war, and in case the Home Guard was unable to utilize local hospitals, the Swedish Red Cross was prepared to set up first aid stations for its use.

==Organisation==

The Home Guard with the national security forces are part of the Swedish Armed Forces&#x27; mission-based organization. The Home Guard is a unit and constitutes the basis for the protection of Sweden. It has the task of operating over the entire conflict scale, from societal support during great strains in peacetime to armed combat in times of war.

The units of the Home Guard have a response capability that is measured in hours, as opposed to days or weeks. The personnel is made up of locally recruited volunteers and consists largely of experienced soldiers and officers with a background in mission-based units.

When the Armed Forces are called in to help with forest fires, flooding or missing person searches, it often falls to Home Guard units to support the police and Rescue Services. Territorial surveillance, base security, escort duties, transport protection, target identification and artillery spotting are other typical Home Guard duties.

In addition to personnel who have completed their national service or Basic Military Training, the Home Guard includes a large proportion of specialists, for example, paramedics, motorcycle orderlies and dog handlers, that are recruited and trained by voluntary defence organizations.

=== Territorial organisation ===
Sweden is divided into four military regions:

* Northern Military Region (MR N) comprises Norrbotten, Västerbotten, Jämtland and Västernorrland counties. The regional command is located at Norrbotten Regiment (I 19) headquarters in Boden.
* Central Military Region (MR M) comprises Stockholm and Gotland, Södermanland, Uppsala, Västmanland, Dalarna and Gävleborg counties. The regional command is located at the Life Guards (LG) headquarters in Stockholm.
* Western Military Region (MR V) comprises Västra Götaland, Halland, Örebro and Värmland counties. The regional command is located at Skaraborg Regiment (P 4) headquarters in Skövde.
* Southern Military Region (MR S) comprises Skåne, Blekinge, Kronoberg, Jönköping, Kalmar and Östergötland counties. The regional command is located at South Scanian Regiment (P 7) headquarters Revinge.

Home Guard battalions are supported for administration, training and logistics by 22 Training Groups (Swedish &quot;Utbildningsgrupp&quot;). The Training Groups are for the most parts the descendants of disbanded regiments and most Home Guard battalions carry the colours and traditions of its antecedent regiment, e.g. the &quot;17. Dalabataljonen&quot; which carries the colours and traditions of the Dalarna Regiment (raised 1628 and disbanded in 2000). Usually, each Training Group supports 1-2 battalions but some have four battalions. The Training Groups in turn belong to a regular regiment. Uniform guidelines and materials for courses are determined centrally by the National Home Guard Combat School.

===Units===
As of 2012, the Home Guard consists of 22,000 soldiers (down from 42,000 in 2001) organized into 40 light infantry battalions (down from 69 in 2001) of 300-700 personnel.

In 2001, the Rapid Response units numbered around 5,000 soldiers of the total of 42,000. Rapid Response units have more combat tasks compared to the rest of the Home Guard, including escort duties. Some battalions located near the coast also have marine companies equipped with Combat Boat 90.

As of 2014, the majority of the force, 17,000 out of 22,000 soldiers will be in Rapid Response units. The decrease in number of troops comes with an equal increase in quality and modern equipment.

The designation &quot;hvbat&quot; is an abbreviation of &quot;Hemvärnsbataljon&quot;, or &quot;Home Guard Battalion&quot;.

== Doctrine of Defence ==
 There are two main ways to form a doctrine for defence: static and dynamic.

A static defence could for example be stationing coastal missile batteries on Gotland. No warning is needed, the equipment and staff is already in place and can hold the area.
A dynamic defence could for example be stationing a coastal missile battery in conjunction with an air transport and airborne troops ready to be transported to any area if warning is given.
The current doctrine MSD 16 includes elements of both strategies in synergy.

According to MSD 16 the National Security Forces are to have an increased integration with the Swedish Defence. National Defensive Force operators are stationed in the area where they live. This means they know the terrain and can more easily spot unusual activity. They will also be the first on site, with the role of detecting, reporting and if possible denying an intruder freedom of action. As first responders to any given region, they are also required to support the mobilisation of the specialised, dynamic defence.

The current organisation of the Swedish defence has highly specialised units which requires time to assemble. During this period, there would be no opposition for a forward operating resource such as an aerial troop landing. However the National Defensive Forces are stationed in the area where they live. In case of a surprise attack, the National Security Forces Handbook states that the National Defensive Forces are to become an integrated part of the dynamic response of the Swedish defence. Since each operator is stationed in the area they live in, they know the terrain, they notice when something is out of place and thus will likely be the first to detect and respond to an incursion. By using knowledge of terrain they are to deny, delay or harass the opposing force until friendly specialised units have been mobilised to the given theatre. They can also aid with this knowledge to achieve synergy in the counteroperation.

The current role of the National Security Forces is dynamic, first acting as the spearhead, first on site. After the more specialised troops have been mobilised and deployed, the role shifts to either aiding the unarmed civilian defence force and securing food, medical care and infrastructure for civilians, or fighting the invading force using asymmetric warfare and local knowledge.

== Key Tasks ==
* Assist/protect mobilisation of specialised units (Swedish Defence)
* Early intelligence
* Make use of forward operating forces difficult or impossible
* Protect key assets from sabotage and theft by qualified or unqualified actors
* Contingency: Free War Doctrine

== Protection and assistance of mobilisation of specialised units ==
The Swedish Defence units are highly specialised, but operators may live far from the given base. Mobilisation during a surprise attack could take several days. The National Defence Force (Hemvärnet) is composed of less specialised units, and each operator is assigned to a unit near their home. This makes Hemvärnet the first qualified force on site, anywhere within the national borders of Sweden. With this in mind, one of the primary roles are to protect the mobilisation of the specialised units as well as assisting through local knowledge.

The lower degree of specialisation of the National Defence Force is here a significant strength, as they are by default able to function well in the random groups that would be formed during the initial phases of a surprise attack. Each unit is expected to practice this.

== Early Intelligence ==
During the initial phases of a surprise conflict, confusion may be significant. With local knowledge, and being the first assembled force on site, the National Defence Force can provide centralised command posts with accurate intelligence. This in turn allows for a more synergistic allocation of resources, and gives a more robust situational awareness to allow for decisions. A secondary effect of accurate intelligence is giving political leaders a correct and reliable strategic situational image.

== Against Qualified Hostile Forward Operating Resource ==
* Detect and report activity to give central command accurate situation intelligence.
* Denial of Access.
* Denial of Freedom of Action.
* Denial of freedom of movement.
* Delaying field work.
* Detection of hostile forward operating elements using dogs, alarm systems, alarm mines and local knowledge.
* If opforce is detected within a key asset, certain National Security Force units have the task to re-take the key asset.
* If possible, elimination of hostile forward operating elements.
* Covert reconnaissance.
* Force reconnaissance.
* Protection of key assets from sabotage or attack.
* Destruction of key assets if undefendable. If excessive explosive loads are used for example on a concrete harbour, only gravel will be left, easily overcome by landing crafts. Destruction is in this case designed to transform the asset into large blocks forming delaying obstacles. For this purpose, special destruction tubes have been built into certain key assets.
* Protection of civilians

== Against Unqualified Opportunistic Actors ==
* Guarding key assets
* Noticing when situation deviates from normal activity, possibly indicating imminent sabotage or theft.
* Protection of civilians
For clarification:
Unqualified opportunistic actors are usually divided into two groups. Criminals and political, with varying overlap.

Criminal gangs, &quot;gangs of war&quot;, are actors who want to steal things for monetary gain. Perhaps they want weapons so they can extort locals, or perhaps they want to steal food deliveries to sell them for extremely high prices.

Politically motivated actors, who may seek to aid the invader, or seek to cause so much chaos that they&#x27;re free to (for a short time) reign over an area and do whatever pleases them.

Though motivations of these may be seen as the polar opposites of each other, their modus operandi are very similar.

== Contingency ==
If all contact with friendly forces is lost, National Security Forces are to follow the &quot;Free War&quot; doctrine. This gives broad authority to the ranking officer and has three goals:
* Engage, delay or harass hostile forces at own discretion.
* Use any means to rejoin or contact friendly forces for synergistic effect.
* Protection of civilians

== Method of operation ==
The Home Guard units are trained to be local combat units (primarily infantry but also signal troops). Although current doctrine states that Home Guard units can act anywhere within the country, local knowledge is one of the strengths of the organization. Training focuses on guard duties and weapons proficiency.

In peacetime the Home Guards main task is to help with search and rescue operations, and to provide assistance to civil society in cases of severe emergencies such as natural disasters and the like.

== Requirements ==
The Home Guard soldier must fulfill the following requirements in order to be object to admittance:
* Swedish citizenship
* Minimum 85 days of basic military training (2 weeks for specialists such as signalists, drivers, dog handlers etc. in addition to their role specific training)
* Approval of personal appraisal - personal examination by the Military Intelligence and Security department, the police and the municipal authorities - and otherwise be suitable for service
* Availability for duty in the Home Guard
* Approved &quot;disposition right&quot;. A person who is &quot;war placed&quot; at another institution is required to be at that institution during an emergency or war. If, for example, a police officer applies to the National Security Forces, the unit will be denied disposition right for this applicant. The officer can still hold a peacetime role, but can not be assigned a war time placement.

Troops are trained regularly and conditions of suitability abilities tested continually.

==Training==
Contractually a member of the Home Guard must train four days (before 2010 20 hours) per year up to eight days for the Rapid Response units, although the time requirement varies according to role. A prerequisite for joining the Home Guard is to have received at least 85 days of basic military training for combat roles and two weeks for certain specialist roles such as signalists, field cooks, nurses and dog handlers. The level of training varies widely, from basic military training to Ranger school.

The training is centered around two 4-day-long battalion exercises per year for the Rapid Response units and one 4-day exercise for the support units. These exercises are mandatory for all personnel. Apart from the mandatory training, the companies organize their own exercises, often up to ten weekend-long exercises a year.

==Equipment==

== Home Guard Bands ==

Military traditions are strongly connected with military bands and marches, etc. The bands, with diverse military musicians, fulfil the task to replace professional military bands. Throughout Sweden, there are about 32 Home Guard bands which total more than 1,500 members, such as Södertörn Home Guard Band. 17 bands are qualified for performance at state ceremonies, royal visits and festivities. Aside from the bands, Home Guard Bugle Bands also are in service within their respective areas, doing tasks formerly done by the now defunct drum and bugle corps of the Armed Forces.

==Home Guard Cadets==
The Home Guard Cadets (&quot;hemvärnsungdomar&quot;) is a youth section consisting of young girls and boys aged 15–20, typically recruited at age 15–16. The Cadets receive military training that includes base building, first aid, communications, physical training, orienteering, defence studies, basic firearms training (with .22 long rifle up to age 16 and AK4 B with red dot sight from age 17) and from age 17 and up also patrolling and leadership training (group and platoon). At 18, a Cadet is allowed to undergo battle training. Despite this they are not officially called soldiers.

Although there is no rank system for Cadets, the training consists of 4 1-year-long blocks named Basic Course, Continuation Course, Leadership Course Level 1 and Leadership Course Level 2 (&quot;Grundkurs&quot;, GK; &quot;Fortsättningskurs&quot;, FK; &quot;Ledarskapskurs 1&quot;, LK1; and &quot;Ledarskapskurs 2&quot;, LK2. LK1 and LK2 are sometimes called Practical Course, PK, and &quot;Instruktörskurs&quot;, IK which means Practical Course and Instructor Course). After 4 years as a Cadet, the 19- to 20-year-old has received military training equivalent to 85 days of basic military training, plus basic commander training.

Typically, the Cadets train one day or evening every or every other week, with 10-12 weekends per year spent in the field. The Home Guard Cadets is the &quot;unit&quot; who spend the most time out on the field in the whole Home Guard. During training they wear the same type of uniform and equipment as the regular forces, although it may vary between the sections depending on local budget and resources. From 2008, a Cadet at least 18 years of age who has completed at least the first three blocks of training is welcome to take a course to repeat and improve learned skills in order to serve in the regular Home Guard at age 20. This is very valuable to many of them, since many of them will not be needed in the Army, Navy or Air Force but are still eager to do military service.

==Associated organisations==
The Home Guard also includes staff from eight voluntary organisations, so-called contractual organisations:

* Swedish Voluntary Flying Corps (FFK) – reconnaissance and transport
* Swedish Air Force Volunteers Association (FVRF) – support for the Swedish Air Force
* Swedish Parachute Association (&quot;Svenska Fallskärmsförbundet&quot;, SFF)
* Swedish Voluntary Motorcycle Corps (&quot;Frivilliga Motorcykelkåren&quot;, FMCK) – despatch riders and reconnaissance
* Swedish Voluntary Radio Organization (FRO) – Radio and telephone connection
* Swedish Working Dog Club (&quot;Svenska Brukshundklubben&quot;, SBK) – service dogs, and Crawl, searching
* Swedish Central Federation of Motor Transport Corps (&quot;Sveriges Bilkårers Riksförbund&quot;, SBR) – Transport and drivers
* Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization (SLK) – rope and staff procedures
* Swedish Auxiliary Naval Corps (SVK) – Water Transport in and defence of the archipelago
* Swedish Civil Defence League (&quot;Civilförsvarsförbundet&quot;) – Educating people on how to handle various crisis situations
* Swedish Federation for Voluntary Defence Education and Training – healthcare professionals and CBRN staff
* Swedish Pistol Shooting Association (&quot;Svenska pistolskytteförbundet&quot;, SPSF)
* Swedish Shooting Sport Federation (SvSF)

In 2006, the Home Guard Bronze Medal (HvBM) of the 8th size was established. The medal is exactly the same in design as the Home Guard Silver Medal, but is embossed in bronze. The ribbon of blue moiré pattern with two vertical yellow, two mm wide stripes in the middle. The number of awards is marked with metal stars on the ribbon and ribbon bar.

In 2019, the Home Guard Service Medal (HVtjgSM/GM/GMmemalj) of the 8th size was established. The award is given to a Home Guard soldiers, Home Guard musicians and volunteer staff with a valid Home Guard contract and to those who remain in the Home Guard as a Home Guard veteran. The medal is made of three denominations: silver, gold and gold with enamel.

In addition to these medals, the Association of Home Guard Officers (&quot;Hemvärnsbefälets Riksförbund&quot;, HBR) awards the Association of Home Guard Officers Royal Medal since 1996 (silver medal since 2018) and the Association of Home Guard Officers Merit Badge since 1991.

<text>Code or text folding, or less commonly holophrasting, is a feature of some graphical user interfaces that allows the user to selectively hide (&quot;fold&quot;) or display (&quot;unfold&quot;) parts of a document. This allows the user to manage large amounts of text while viewing only those subsections that are currently of interest. It is typically used with documents which have a natural tree structure consisting of nested elements. Other names for these features include expand and collapse, code hiding, and outlining. In Microsoft Word, the feature is called &quot;collapsible outlining&quot;.

Many user interfaces provide disclosure widgets for code folding in a sidebar, indicated for example by a triangle that points sideways (if collapsed) or down (if expanded), or by a codice_1 box for collapsible (expanded) text, and a codice_2 box for expandable (collapsed) text.

Code folding is found in text editors, source code editors, and IDEs. The folding structure typically follows the syntax tree of the program defined by the computer language. It may also be defined by levels of indentation, or be specified explicitly using an in-band marker (saved as part of the source code) or out-of-band.

Text folding is a similar feature used on ordinary text, where the nested elements consist of paragraphs, sections, or outline levels. Programs offering this include folding editors, outliners, and some word processors.

Data folding is found in some hex editors and is used to structure a binary file or hide inaccessible data sections. 

Folding is also frequently used in data comparison, to select one version or another, or only the differences.

==History==
The earliest known example of code folding in an editor is in NLS. Probably the first widely available folding editor was the 1974 Structured Programming Facility (SPF) editor for IBM 370 mainframes, which could hide lines based on their indentation. It displayed on character-mapped 3270 terminals. It was very useful for prolix languages like COBOL. It evolved into the Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF).

==Use==
Code folding has various use patterns, primarily organizing code or hiding less useful information so one can focus on more important information. Common patterns follow.

===Outlining===
Most basically, applications use code folding to outline source code, collapsing each block to a single line. This can be only top-level blocks like functions and classes, nested blocks like nested functions and methods, or all blocks, notably control-flow blocks. This allows one to get an overview of code, easily navigating and rearranging it, and to drill down into more detail as needed, without being distracted by other code. Viewing-wise, this allows one to quickly see a list of all functions (without their bodies), while navigation-wise this replaces extensive paging past long functions – or searching for the target – with going directly to the next function.

===Hiding boilerplate code===
Some languages or libraries require extensive boilerplate code. This results in extremely long code, which can obscure the main point. Further, substantive code can be lost in the boilerplate.

For example, in Java a single private field with a getter and setter requires at least 3 lines, if each is on a separate line:
private String name = null;
public String getName() { return name; }
public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
This expands to 10 lines with conventional function line breaks and spacing between functions (including trailing newline):
private String name = null;

public String getName() {
 return name;

public void setName(String name) {
 this.name = name;


Documentation with Javadoc expands this to 20 lines:
/**
 * Property codice_3 readable/writable.
private String name = null;
 * Getter for property codice_3
public String getName() {
 return name;

 * Setter for property codice_3.
 * @param name
public void setName(String name) {
 this.name = name;


If there are many such fields, the result can easily be hundreds of lines of code with very little &quot;interesting&quot; content – code folding can reduce this to a single line per field, or even to a single line for all fields. Further, if all routine fields are folded, but non-routine fields (where getter or setter is not just returning or assigning a private field) are not folded, it becomes easier to see the substantive code.

===Collapsing metadata===
Metadata can be lengthy, and is generally less important than the data it is describing. Collapsing metadata allows one to primarily focus on the data, not the metadata. For example, a long list of attributes in C# may be manually collapsed as follows:
#region Attributes
[Browsable(false)]
[MergableProperty(false)]
[DefaultValue(null)]
[PersistenceMode(PersistenceMode.InnerProperty)]
[TemplateContainer(typeof(MyType))]
[TemplateInstance(TemplateInstance.Single)] 
#endregion
public ITemplate ContentTemplate { get; set; }
The resulting code displays as:

Attributes
public ITemplate ContentTemplate { get; set; }
===Collapsing comments===
Comments are a form of human-readable metadata, and lengthy comments can disrupt the flow of code. This can be the case either for a long comment for a short section of code, such as a paragraph to explain one line, or comments for documentation generators, such as Javadoc or XML Documentation. Code folding allows one to have long comments, but to display them only when required. In cases where a long comment has a single summary line, such as Python docstrings, the summary can still be displayed when the section is collapsed, allowing a summary/detailed view.

===Showing structure or sandwich code in structured programming===
Structured programming consists of nested blocks of code, and long blocks of code – such as long switch statements – can obscure the overall structure. Code folding allows one to see the overall structure and expand to a specific level. Further, in some uses, particularly strict structured programming (single function exit), there are code patterns that are hard to see when looking at expanded code. For example, in resource management in structured programming, one generally acquires a resource, followed by a block of code using the resource, and finishing with releasing the resource. The acquisition/release pairing is hard to see if there is a long block of code in between, but easy to see if the intervening block is folded. Similarly, in conditional code like codice_6, secondary blocks may be far from the condition statement.

===Grouping code===
Fold groups can be used to group code, either by explicit grouping – similar to comment blocks separating a module into sections, or class members into associated groups – or implicitly, such as by automatically grouping class members by access level.

===Hiding legacy code===
Legacy code – or any code that a developer does not wish to view or change at a given point in time – can be folded away so that programmers can concentrate on the code under consideration.

=== Hiding in-source data tables ===

==Conventions==
In order to support code folding, the text editor must provide a mechanism for identifying &quot;folding points&quot; within a text file. Some text editors provide this mechanism automatically, while others provide defaults that can either be overridden or augmented by the user.

There are various mechanisms, coarsely divided as automatic and manual – do they require any specification by the programmer? Folding points are usually determined with one or more of the following mechanisms. Each of these has its own distinct advantages and difficulties, and it is essentially up to the developers who create the text editor software to decide which to implement. Text editors that provide support for multiple folding mechanisms typically allow the user to choose which is most appropriate for the file being edited.

===Syntax-dependent===
Syntax-dependent folding points are those that rely on the content of the file being edited in order to specify where specific folding regions should begin and end. Syntax-based folding points are typically defined around any or all of the standard sub-features of the markup language or programming language in use. These are desirable due to being automatic and agreeing with code structure, but may require significant work to implement, and time to compute when editing a file.

===Indentation-based===
Indentation-based folding points are generally specified by the position and sequence of non-printing whitespace, such as tabs and spaces, within the text. This is most often used as a simple form of syntax-based folding, as indentation almost always reflects nesting level in indent styles for structured programming languages.

This convention is particularly suitable to syntaxes that have an off-side rule, so the structure largely agrees with the indent. Examples include Python and text files that require indentation as a rule by themselves. However, even in these cases, structure does not exactly agree with indent, such as in line continuation, and thus syntax-dependent folding is preferred.

===Token-based===
Token-based folding points are specified using special delimiters that serve no other purpose in the text than to identify the boundaries of folding points. This convention can be compared to indentation-based folding points, where printable characters are used instead of whitespace. The most common delimiter tokens are codice_7 to end it.

Another notable token is codice_8 (C# directives), respectively codice_9 (Visual Basic directives), used in Microsoft Visual Studio Code Editor. These are treated syntactically as compiler directives, though they do not affect compilation.

As a manual method, token-based folding allows discretion in grouping code based on arbitrary criteria, such as &quot;functions related to a given task&quot;, which cannot be inferred from syntactic analysis.

Token-based folding requires in-band signalling, with folding tokens essentially being structured comments, and unlike other methods, are present in the source code and visible to other programmers. This allows them to be shared, but also requires their use (or preservation) by all programmers working on a particular file, and can cause friction and maintenance burden.

===User-specified===
User-specified folding allows the user to fold sections of text using a generic selection method, but without changing the source code (out-of-band), instead being specified only in the editor. For example, a programmer may select some lines of text and specify that they should be folded. Folded text might be anonymous or named, and this may be preserved across editing sessions or discarded. Unlike token-based folding, this does not change the source text – it thus is not shared with other editors of the file, and is not visible in the code.

==Examples==
The following document contains folding tokens (codice_7):

When loaded into a folding editor, the outline structure will be shown:

Usually clicking on the codice_11 marks makes the appropriate body text appear.

==Software with code folding capability==
One of the earliest folding editors was STET, an editor written for the VM/CMS operating system in 1977 by Mike Cowlishaw. STET is a text editor (for documentation, programs, etc.) which folds files on the basis of blocks of lines; any block of lines can be folded and replaced by a name line (which in turn can be part of a block which itself can then be folded).

A folding editor appeared in the occam IDE &quot;circa&quot; 1983, which was called the Inmos Transputer Development System (TDS). The &quot;f&quot; editor (in list below) probably is the most intact legacy from this work.

The Macintosh computer historically had a number of source code editors that &quot;folded&quot; portions of code via &quot;disclosure triangles&quot;. The UserLand Software product Frontier is a scripting environment that has this capability.

Folding is provided by many modern text editors, and syntax-based or semantics-based folding is now a component of many software development environments. Editors include:

<text>Tunceli (, , ) is a municipality (belde) in Tunceli District and capital of Tunceli Province, Turkey. The city has a Kurdish majority. It had a population of 35,161 in 2021.

==Name==

During Ottoman times, the settlement was called &quot;Kalan&quot; or &quot;Mameki&quot;. Tunceli, which is a modern name, literally means &quot;bronze fist&quot; in Turkish (&quot;tunç&quot; meaning &quot;bronze&quot; and &quot;eli&quot;, in this context, meaning &quot;fist&quot;). It shares the name with the military operation under which the Dersim massacre was conducted. The province of Dersim (or Dêsim) was renamed Tunceli in 1935, as was the settlement of Kalan, which became the province&#x27;s administrative center in 1938. Dersim is popularly understood to be composed of the Kurdish/Zazaki words &quot;der&quot; (&quot;door&quot;) and &quot;sim&quot; (&quot;silver&quot;), thus meaning &quot;silver door.&quot; Whether the town should be called Dersim or Tunceli has been a cause of political quarrels. In May 2019, the local authorities decided to call it Dersim, while the governor said it was against the law to call it Dersim.

==History==

During the time of the Ottoman Empire, Tunceli (then known as Kalan) was a part of the region named &quot;Dersim&quot;. In 1847, Dersim was declared a sanjak (a historical administrative unit smaller than the province). The capital of the sanjak was Hozat. During the Republican period, Tunceli Province was established in 1935. In 1946, the former town of Kalan was renamed as Tunceli and it was declared as the capital city of the province.

As a result of the Turkish campaign of &quot;Turkification&quot; Tunceli became a main target of Turkish officials after the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Tunceli played a role in the Dersim rebellion by the Kurds.

Tunceli is famous for excellent rankings in National Education statistics.

== Politics ==
In the Municipal Elections which took place on 31st of March 2019, Fatih Mehmet Maçoğlu was elected Mayor. He is the first mayor of Tunceli from the Communist Party of Turkey.

In 2018, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan stated that if &quot;those involved with terrorism&quot; (referring to the HDP party) were to win the elections, that his government would &quot;appoint trustees without delay&quot;.

In May 2019 the Municipal Council decided to use the city&#x27;s historic name Dersim and also to offer municipal services in Zazaki and Kurmanji. 4 Members of the newly elected municipal council had their certificates revoked in May 2019 for having been dismissed from public office in the past.

==Economy==
The main economic activity is animal breeding. Wheat is the only notable agricultural product. There are chromium, salt and marble deposits, but only salt is produced. There are a few factories based on agriculture.

==Climate==
Tunceli has a continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsa,&quot; Trewartha: &quot;Dc&quot;) with very hot, dry summers and cold, snowy winters.

<doc id="592016" wikidata="Q616642" url="?curid=592016" title="Broken Social Scene">
<text>Broken Social Scene is a Canadian indie rock band and musical collective including as few as six and as many as nineteen members, formed by Kevin Drew (vocals, guitar) and Brendan Canning (vocals, bass) in 1999. Alongside Drew and Canning, the other core members of the band are Justin Peroff (drums), Andrew Whiteman (guitar) and Charles Spearin (guitar).

Most of its members play in various other groups and solo projects, mainly in the city of Toronto. These associated acts include Metric, Feist, Stars, Apostle of Hustle, Do Make Say Think, KC Accidental, Emily Haines &amp; The Soft Skeleton, Amy Millan, and Jason Collett.

The group&#x27;s sound combines elements of all of its members&#x27; respective musical projects, and is occasionally considered baroque pop. It includes grand orchestrations featuring guitars, horns, woodwinds, and violins, unusual song structures, and an experimental, and sometimes chaotic production style from David Newfeld, who produced the second and third albums.

Stuart Berman&#x27;s &quot;This Book Is Broken&quot; (2009) covers the band from its inception to its critical acclaim. In 2010, Bruce McDonald made &quot;This Movie Is Broken&quot;, a movie about the band&#x27;s Harbourfront show during the 2009 Toronto strike.

The collective and their respective projects have had a broad influence on alternative music and indie rock during the early 21st century; in 2021 Pitchfork listed the band among the &quot;most important artists&quot; of the last 25 years.

==History==
===&quot;Feel Good Lost&quot;===
The band was formed in 1999 by core members Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning. This duo recorded and released the band&#x27;s ambient debut album, &quot;Feel Good Lost&quot;, on Noise Factory Records in 2001, with contributions by Justin Peroff, Charles Spearin, Bill Priddle, Leslie Feist, Jessica Moss and Stars&#x27; Evan Cranley.

Drew and Canning&#x27;s material at the time was almost entirely instrumental, so they brought together musicians from the Toronto indie scene, the album contributors as well as Andrew Whiteman, Jason Collett, and Metric&#x27;s Emily Haines, to flesh out their live show with lyrics and vocals. Over time, the band came to include contributions from James Shaw, Justin Peroff, John Crossingham, and Stars member Amy Millan.

===&quot;You Forgot It in People&quot;===
All of the musicians from the live show joined Drew, Canning, Peroff and Spearin to record the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;You Forgot It in People&quot;. The album was produced by David Newfeld and released on Paper Bag Records in October 2002 and won the Alternative Album of the Year Juno Award in 2003. The album also included musical contributions by Priddle, Jessica Moss, Brodie West, Susannah Brady and Ohad Benchetrit, but these were credited as supporting musicians rather than band members. On the supporting tour, the core band consisted of Drew, Canning, Peroff, Whiteman and Jason Collett, along whichever band members were available on each show date.

In 2003, the B-sides and remix collection &quot;Bee Hives&quot; was released.

Broken Social Scene&#x27;s song &quot;Lover&#x27;s Spit&quot; from 2002&#x27;s &quot;You Forgot It in People&quot; has been featured in director Clément Virgo&#x27;s movie &quot;Lie with Me&quot; (2005), Paul McGuigan&#x27;s &quot;Wicker Park&quot; (2004), Bruce McDonald&#x27;s &quot;The Love Crimes of Gillian Guess&quot; (2004), Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (2003) and the penultimate episode of the Canadian series &quot;&quot;Terminal City&quot;&quot; (2005). The version of &quot;Lover&#x27;s Spit&quot; found on 2004&#x27;s &quot;Bee Hives&quot; record was also featured in an episode of the third season of the FX series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;. Showtime&#x27;s television program &quot;The L Word&quot; featured &quot;Pacific Theme&quot; and &quot;Looks Just Like the Sun&quot;, both from &quot;You Forgot It in People&quot;, in the show&#x27;s first season. &quot;Lover&#x27;s Spit&quot; is referenced in the 2013 Lorde song, &quot;Ribs&quot;. &quot;Looks Just Like the Sun&quot; was featured in the 2006 film &quot;Swedish Auto&quot;. &quot;Stars and Sons&quot; from &quot;You Forgot It in People&quot; also appeared in the movie &quot;The Invisible&quot;. Music from the band&#x27;s albums was used to score the 2006 film &quot;Half Nelson&quot;.

===&quot;Broken Social Scene&quot;===
Broken Social Scene released their third full-length album, &quot;Broken Social Scene&quot;, also produced by Newfeld, in October 2005, with new contributors including k-os, Jason Tait and Murray Lightburn. New band members were Newfeld and Torquil Campbell, who were members of the band Stars. A limited edition EP, &quot;EP to Be You and Me&quot; was also printed along with the album.

Broken Social Scene performed &quot;7/4 (Shoreline)&quot; on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on January 31, 2006, and that year they performed &quot;Ibi Dreams of Pavement&quot; at the 2006 Juno Awards, at which their self-titled album won the Alternative Album of the Year award. In August the band went on a European tour. Returning in September, they were last-minute replacement performers at North America&#x27;s first Virgin Festival, at Toronto Islands Park after headliners Massive Attack cancelled due to problems involving obtaining US visas. The band quickly assembled to play a one-hour closing performance on the main stage, following The Strokes and The Raconteurs. Through the performance the band was joined by Feist, Amy Millan of Stars, k-os, and Emily Haines of Metric. This was the last show featuring the entire 15 member line-up of the band until 2009.

After a US tour in November, the band went on hiatus while members worked on their other projects. In late 2006, several members of the band appeared as special guests on &quot;The Stars and Suns Sessions&quot;, the second album from Mexican indie band Chikita Violenta. The album was produced by Dave Newfeld.

In May 2008, the band contributed a T-shirt design for the Yellow Bird Project to raise money and awareness for the Lake Ontario Waterkeeper. The shirt was designed by their drummer, Justin Peroff, and bears the slogan &quot;Hope for Truth&quot;.

Members of Broken Social Scene composed and recorded an original score for director Marc Evans&#x27;s film &quot;Snow Cake&quot;, as well as scored his 2007 film adaptation of Maureen Medved&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Tracey Fragments&quot;. In 2009, Bruce McDonald directed a short documentary episode of IFC&#x27;s &quot;The Rawside Of...&quot; that focused on the making of Brendan Canning&#x27;s solo album &quot;Something for All of Us&quot;.

===&quot;Broken Social Scene Presents...&quot;===
In June 2007, BSS founder Kevin Drew began recording an album which featured many members of Broken Social Scene. The album was produced by Ohad Benchetrit and Charles Spearin and was titled &quot;Broken Social Scene presents ..Spirit If...&quot;. The album was recorded throughout 2004 and 2006 in Ohad Benchetrit&#x27;s house while the band was not on tour. Although billed as a solo project, most Broken Social Scene members make cameo appearances. The sound itself is Broken Social Scene&#x27;s familiar mix of rough and ragged, sad and celebratory, with psychedelic swells and acoustic jangles. Also featured are Dinosaur Jr.&#x27;s J Mascis and Canadian rock icon Tom Cochrane playing and singing and handclapping along. The album was released on September 18, 2007, and a tour billed as Broken Social Scene Performs Kevin Drew&#x27;s &quot;Spirit If...&quot; took place in late 2007.

The second &quot;Broken Social Scene presents...&quot; record, by Brendan Canning, is entitled &quot;Something for All of Us&quot; and was released on Arts &amp; Crafts in July 2008. Broken Social Scene also took part in the 2008 Siren Music Festival in Coney Island, Brooklyn.

On April 29, 2009, Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning guest-hosted 102.1 The Edge&#x27;s program &quot;The Indie Hour&quot; to promote their concert at the Olympic Island Festival. The festival was later moved to Harbourfront Centre after a labour dispute resulted in the suspension of ferry service to the Toronto Islands.
In May 2009 Arts &amp; Crafts, with association from Anansi Press, released &quot;This Book Is Broken&quot; written by &quot;The Grid&quot; editor Stuart Berman, who had a close personal involvement with the band. The book includes artwork, concert posters and photographs (professional and amateur) of the band. Berman includes extensive interviews with band members and related persons, arranged by subject and chronology.

===&quot;Forgiveness Rock Record&quot;===
In June 2009, the band played a short set to launch &quot;This Book Is Broken&quot; at the North by Northeast festival. They played a mix of new songs from their then-upcoming album and old favourites, and were joined by Feist, who also joined them on their second visit to Mexico City in October.

During the band&#x27;s free performance at the Harbourfront Centre on July 11, 2009, they were joined by nearly all past contributors, including Feist, Emily Haines and James Shaw, Amy Millan and Evan Cranley, John Crossingham, Jason Collett and Julie Penner. This revue-like show celebrated other projects by members as well as including material from the then-upcoming album. Emcee Bruce McDonald announced the filming of a documentary directed by him and written by Don McKellar, Titled &quot;This Movie Is Broken&quot;, it includes concert footage and a fictional romance. Although McDonald announced at the concert that film submitted by fans would be used in the movie, the final cut of the movie included only one submission, a front-row recording of &quot;Major Label Debut&quot;.

Broken Social Scene released their fourth full-length album on May 4, 2010. Entitled &quot;Forgiveness Rock Record&quot;, it was recorded at Soma in Chicago, with John McEntire producing, and in Toronto at the studio of Sebastian Grainger and James Shaw. For the first time, Amy Millan, Emily Haines, and Leslie Feist recorded a track together (albeit at different times). This album was short-listed for the 2010 Polaris Music Prize.

In August 2010, Broken Social Scene initiated their &quot;All to All&quot; remix series, which included seven different versions of the track from &quot;Forgiveness Rock Record&quot;. Every Monday a new remix was released and available for 24 hours via a different online partner. The first version, &quot;All to All (Sebastien Sexy Legs Grainger Remix)&quot;, by Sebastien Grainger, was released August 9 via Pitchfork.

===&quot;Lo-Fi for the Dividing Nights&quot;===
During the recording of &quot;Forgiveness Rock Record&quot;, the group also worked on tracks for &quot;Lo-Fi for the Dividing Nights&quot; while in Chicago. While John McEntire worked in the main room, during downtime band members would head into Soma&#x27;s second smaller studio (B-Room) to test out and record new ideas and overdubs. One of their collaborations, &quot;Me &amp; My Hand&quot;, ended up being the closing song on &quot;Forgiveness Rock Record&quot;; the rest became the beginnings of the later album.

===Hiatus===
In October 2011 the band put on a show featuring Isaac Brock and went on a fall tour in support of TV on the Radio. After their concert in November in Rio de Janeiro, the band took a long break from performing until 2013, when they headlined the Field Trip Arts &amp; Crafts Music Festival, celebrating tenth anniversary of their label Arts &amp; Crafts.

The band appeared on a number of compilation albums released in 2013, including &quot;Arts &amp; Crafts: 2003−2013&quot; (&quot;7/4 (Shoreline)&quot;, &quot;Lover&#x27;s Spit&quot; and &quot;Deathcock&quot;), &quot;Arts &amp; Crafts: X&quot; (&quot;Day of the Kid&quot;) and &quot;Sing Me the Songs: Celebrating the Works of Kate McGarrigle&quot; (&quot;Mother Mother&quot;).

===Broken Social Scene Story Project===
In 2013, publisher House of Anansi teamed with several members of Broken Social Scene to sponsor the Broken Social Scene short story contest.

===&quot;Hug of Thunder&quot; (2015–2018)===
The band began to play occasional festivals in 2015 and 2016, including a performance at the Electric Arena in September 2016. They released &quot;Halfway Home&quot;, the first single from their new album, on March 30, 2017.

On March 30, 2017, they appeared on the &quot;Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; as musical guests and performed &quot;Halfway Home&quot;. Emily Haines and James Shaw of Metric, and Amy Millan and Evan Cranley of Stars joined the band for the performance.

The album, &quot;Hug of Thunder&quot;, was released July 7, 2017.

On May 15, 2017, the band shared the title track with vocals from Leslie Feist. On May 31, 2017, the band released &quot;Skyline&quot;, the album&#x27;s third preview single. On June 26, 2017, the band released the album&#x27;s fourth and final preview track &quot;Stay Happy&quot;, which features new member Ariel Engle on lead vocals.

Broken Social Scene began a tour of Europe and North America in May 2017, which concluded in fall 2017.

=== &quot;Let&#x27;s Try the After&quot; (2019–present) ===
On January 22, 2019, the band released the single &quot;All I Want&quot; and the details of an EP titled &quot;Let&#x27;s Try the After, Vol. 1&quot; which was released February 15, 2019.

They debuted two new songs, &quot;Can’t Find My Heart&quot; and &quot;1972&quot;, from the new EP during an appearance on CBC Music&#x27;s &quot;The Strombo Show&quot;. The EP&#x27;s first official single was &quot;All I Want&quot;.

On March 20, 2019, they announced the sequel EP &quot;Let&#x27;s Try the After, Vol 2&quot;, which was released April 12, 2019, on Arts &amp; Crafts. Its first single was &quot;Can&#x27;t Find My Heart&quot;.

<text>The King&#x27;s Head is one of the oldest public houses with a coaching yard in the south of England. It is located in the Market Square, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and is a Grade II* Listed Building.

The oldest part of the current structure of the building is of 15th-century design; however, the cellars are much older, dating back to the 13th century, and may have been part of the local friary.

==History==
The history of The King&#x27;s Head starts in 1455, with the first documentary reference appearing in a conveyance between William Wandeford, a London wool merchant, and Ralph Verney, a former master of the London Mercer&#x27;s Company, dated 18 December 1455. It refers to the newly built &#x27;Kyngeshede&#x27;, as well as a cellar and shop, and cottages. The Great Hall is the oldest standing structure on site, dating back to the 1470s, and was built as a guest house by the Verney family (of nearby Claydon House).

King Henry VI possibly stayed at the inn while on a tour of the country with his new wife Margaret of Anjou in the 15th century. Later, a stained glass panel, previously in the nearby Greyfriars monastery, was inserted in the front window of the inn showing the king and queen&#x27;s individual coats of arms. The other coats of arms are of Cardinal Henry Beaufort, William de la Pole and the local Botlier family. That window is still there, though it is heavily protected.

From the mid 17th century onwards, The King&#x27;s Head thrived as a coaching inn. The front gateway is smaller than the rear gateway, which was made larger to accommodate the growing size of carriages; the wheel knocking stones still visible at the entrance aligning the carriage wheels as they entered.

In c.1750, innkeeper William Bell converted the cottages (now the public house) to accommodate stagecoaches with room upstairs for his servants. The enclosure of the courtyard with additional stables to the one at the rear, which dates back to the late 16th century, provided housing for nearly thirty horses. The hoop above the mounting block was used to light the way of the coaches by burning rags tied round it. The walls have been limewashed allowing the timbers to breathe, as standard paint will seal in moisture and cause rot. Over time the timbers will show through more as the lime wash weathers away.

===The English Civil War===
At the time of the Civil War, Aylesbury was very much in support of the Parliamentarians against Charles I. It is likely that at some point, Parliamentarian troops would have visited The King&#x27;s Head. It is thought that Oliver Cromwell was in Aylesbury around 1650, although there is no evidence that he stayed at The King&#x27;s Head.

It is claimed that the inn is linked to other churches and establishments in the town via a system of underground tunnels that were in use during the Civil War as escape routes should the town be taken by Royalist troops. However, there is no evidence of this and it is more likely that these &#x27;tunnels&#x27; are simply cellars.

Following the English Civil War coins were in short supply. Inns like The King&#x27;s Head took to minting trade tokens on this site when William Dawney was innkeeper in 1657. They could be used as currency and you can see copies of these tokens on display.

==Construction==
In the Great Hall, the wattle and daub timber construction can be seen on display. Wattle was twigs and branches woven between the upright timber posts. Daub was the name given to clay, lime and horsehair pushed into the wattle frame forming a weatherproof surface.

==Notable features==
A rare surviving clock decorates the wall, a Tavern clock, also known as an Act of Parliament clock. In 1797, William Pitt the Younger introduced a tax on all clocks and watches and public clocks such as these became much more popular to check the time of day. The bar was installed by the Rothschild family who had acquired the property as a hotel in the 19th century. In the snug next to the bar is an example of Victorian era wallpaper that would once have covered the whole room.

In the late 17th century, The King&#x27;s Head began taking delivery of mail, which was dropped by horsemen through a hatch behind the mirrors. The room is called the &#x27;Glue Pot&#x27; as mail was once sorted and stamped here. Beneath a range of meat hooks is a square patch where the hole for the post would have been dropped into the Glue Pot. It is just the right height for a mail delivery on horseback. The cobbled passage leads into the courtyard that dates back to the early 14th century when it was the original market square. There are three layers of cobblestones.

==Ghost stories==
The supernatural history of The King&#x27;s Head tells of at least three known ghosts to haunt the property. One is that of The Grey Lady, a ghost said to stand by the fireplace in the Great Hall and another has also been seen in the corridor by the red staircase. It is thought that she is a maid who fell to her death in about 1900.

==Rooms==
===Georgian Room===
The Georgian Room is so called because of the style of panel on the walls, which date from between 1714 and 1837. The Hussar&#x27;s belt and satchel on the wall belong to the Royal Bucks Hussars. The belt would have held a decorative sword used by the mounted cavalry of the 19th century. The satchel is surrounded by silver braid with &#x27;VR&#x27; surmounted by a crown on the centre panel.

===Gatehouse Chamber===
One of the grandest rooms at The King&#x27;s Head is the Gatehouse Chamber. This dates from the mid-16th century but, in the 17th century, Assize Courts met here to discuss criminal cases. Judges would announce their verdicts out of the front window of the chamber, which would have then overlooked the Market Square. The first floor offered the judge both prestige and protection from possible angry locals. Amongst the many judges who visited the King&#x27;s Head was the infamous Judge George Jeffreys. In 1700 local magistrates considered converting The King&#x27;s Head into an overflow jail, but the sum of £400 for refurbishment was thought to be prohibitively expensive. The main feature of the room is the ceiling, which is the work of the Victorian architect George Devey who was commissioned by the Rothschild family in the 1880s to undertake changes to The King&#x27;s Head. He was responsible for offsetting the front window to retain the view of the Market Square. He also remodelled the ceiling in a mock Tudor style using some of the original beams, but the black and white design is a Victorian idea of how Tudor buildings looked. Tudor rooms could, in fact, be quite colourful. The large medieval hearth was moved here from the Great Hall. It is etched with graffiti, possibly by Roundhead troops garrisoned here during the English Civil War.

===Solar room===
The Solar Room, built directly above the Great Hall, was the master bedroom and, according to local folklore, was the suite where King Henry VIII wooed Anne Boleyn in 1533. It is claimed that Oliver Cromwell stayed at the King&#x27;s Head in 1651 after the Battle of Worcester and received the thanks of Parliament in Market Square, although there is no evidence for this. However, if Cromwell did stay here, this is the room that he would have stayed in. Flintlock pistols and swords were found earlier in the 20th century in a &#x27;priest hole&#x27; and suggest that Roundhead troops were at one time garrisoned at the property. The roof is Victorian except for the original tie beam and queen post frame in the back wall. The room was originally accessed from the ground floor by a newel stair, which is a spiral staircase inside a tower.

===Dining room===
The Dining Room was built in the late 19th century when the King&#x27;s Head was a hotel. George Devey inserted the oak panels. The room originally had two fireplaces and it was here, in November 2003, that the ghost of a nun was seen. The nun had been seen before, but only ever appearing to ladies, and the dining room itself was built on land that once belonged to the church or friary.

==The National Trust==
After a number of years serving as a hotel as part of the Rothschild business empire, the property was donated to the National Trust in 1925, a fact commemorated by a plaque at the site. The Trust are developing the site to serve as a focal point for the community of Aylesbury. Visitors to Aylesbury are still able to go to the inn and purchase alcoholic beverages in the same way that they would in any other pub.

The pub, The Farmers&#x27; Bar, within The King&#x27;s Head site has been run by The Chiltern Brewery since 2005.

<doc id="592030" wikidata="Q1097922" url="?curid=592030" title="Leg warmer">
<text>Leg warmers are coverings for the lower legs, similar to long socks but thicker and generally footless. Leg warmers are worn to keep the lower legs warm in colder weather. They can be tubular sleeves, long fabric wrappings, or simple pieces of fur or fabric tied around the calves. They are used in several outdoor activities and sports including cycling, soccer, hockey, hiking, ice skating, and dance.

They are used as dancewear by ballet and other classic dancers in order to keep the leg muscles warm and to prevent cramping or other muscle injuries. No scientific data has been yet collected to substantiate the claim that leg warmers prevent injury.

Traditionally knitted from pure sheep wool, modern variants are more typically made of cotton, synthetic fibers, or both. Some are made of other materials, such as chenille.

Leg warmers can vary in length, and in width, due to the material&#x27;s stretchiness. They are commonly worn between the ankle to just below the knee, though many dancers prefer it to extend to cover the lower parts of the thigh. Some cover the entire foot—these &quot;warmers&quot; usually have a pad that grips the floor so the dancer does not slip. Some leg warmers are particularly short and made of thinner material; these are also known as &quot;ankle warmers&quot;.

Originally, legwarmers were worn by dancers to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching. In the early 1980s leg warmers became a fad after David Lee and Trisha Kate opened a dancewear shop in the East Village, New York. They mainly sold legwarmers. Wearing them was fashionable among teenage girls; later to be an adopted fashion by boys in the city of Berkeley in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their popularity was partly due to the influence of the films &quot;Fame&quot;, &quot;Xanadu&quot; and &quot;Flashdance&quot; and the concurrent aerobics craze. They were worn with leggings, jeans, and tights or as part of aerobic wear. They were internationally popular in the 1980s.

<text>Cipla Limited is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company headquartered in Mumbai. Cipla primarily focuses on developing medication to treat respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, diabetes, depression, paediatric and various other medical conditions. Cipla has 47 manufacturing locations across the world and sells its products in 86 countries. It is the third-largest drug producer in India.

==History ==
Cipla was founded in Mumbai in 1935 by Khwaja Abdul Hamied as the Chemical, Industrial &amp; Pharmaceutical Laboratories.
In July 1984, the name of the company was changed to &#x27;Cipla&#x27;.

Upon Hamied&#x27;s death in 1972, his son Yusuf Hamied, a Cambridge-educated chemist, took over the company.

In 1995, Cipla launched Deferiprone, the world&#x27;s first oral iron chelator.

In 1999, Cipla joined the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance as a founding member in an effort to promote the development of generic drugs in India. During the AIDS epidemic in the early 2000s, Hamied reverse-engineered a three-drug antiretroviral medication that was sold for about $12,000 per year to create a cheaper version that sold for $304 per year. This drug was sold to African charities and governments. It is estimated that &quot;at one time, as much as 40 percent of the AIDS patients in poor countries took Cipla drugs&quot;.

During the avian flu pandemic in 2006, Cipla was able to reverse-engineer the drug Tamiflu and sell it for significantly lower prices.

In 2013 Cipla acquired the South African company Cipla-Medpro. Its name was changed to Cipla Medpro South Africa Limited and was kept as a subsidiary. At the time of the acquisition, Cipla-Medpro had been a distribution partner for Cipla and was South Africa&#x27;s third-biggest pharmaceutical company. The company had been founded in 2002 under the name Enaleni Pharmaceuticals Ltd. In 2005, Enaleni bought all the shares of Cipla-Medpro, which had been a joint venture between Cipla and Medpro Pharmaceuticals, a South African generics company; in 2008, it changed its name to Cipla-Medpro. In September 2023, it was announced Cipla South Africa had acquired the Midrand-headquartered healthcare products manufacturer, Actor Pharma.

In September 2015, Cipla acquired InvaGen Pharmaceuticals and Exelan Pharmaceuticals, two American pharmaceutical companies, for 555 million dollars.

In 2019 Cipla entered digital therapeutics by partnering with Wellthy Therapeutics in India and Brandmed in South Africa.

In April 2024, Cipla acquired Ivia Beaute Pvt Ltd&#x27;s cosmetics and personal care distribution and marketing business for ₹130 crore.

==Products and services==
Cipla sells active pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers as well as pharmaceutical and personal care products, including the anti-depressant escitalopram oxalate, lamivudine, and fluticasone propionate. Cipla is the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of antiretroviral drugs.

In July 2020, the company announced the introduction of Gilead Sciences&#x27; Remdesivir under the brand name CIPREMI in India after reaching a voluntary licensing agreement with the parent company and DCGI approval for &quot;restricted emergency use&quot; in COVID-19 treatment of patients in critical condition.

==Operations==

Cipla has 34 manufacturing units in 8 locations across India and a presence in over 80 countries. Exports accounted for 48% of its revenue for the 2013–14 fiscal year. Cipla spent 517 crore (5.4% of their revenue) in the 2013–14 fiscal year on R&amp;D activities. The primary focus areas for R&amp;D were development of new formulations, drug-delivery systems, and APIs. Cipla also cooperates with other enterprises in areas such as consulting, commissioning, engineering, project appraisal, quality control, know-how transfer, support, and plant supply.

During the FY 2013–14, the company incurred on employee benefit expenses.

According to Cipla&#x27;s 2022-23 annual report, the company had over 25,000 employees, out of which 14.3% were women.

== Listings and shareholding==

The equity shares of Cipla are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the BSE SENSEX index, and the National Stock Exchange of India, where it is a constituent of the CNX Nifty. Its Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

As of December 31, 2022, the promoter group, Y. K. Hamied and his family, held around 33.61% equity shares in Cipla. Individual shareholders hold approximately 14.72% of its shares. SBI Mutual Fund, LIC etc. are the largest non-promoter shareholders in the Company. In January 2024, Samina Hamied resigned from her position as the Executive Vice Chairperson of Cipla. She continued to serve the company as a non-executive director subject to rotational retirement.


==Awards and recognitions==
* In 1980, Cipla won Chemexcil Award for Excellence for exports.
* In 2006, Cipla won Dun &amp; Bradstreet American Express Corporate Awards.
* In 2007, Forbes included Cipla in the 200 &#x27;Best under a billion&#x27; list of best small Asian companies.
* In 2012, Cipla received the Thomson Reuters India Innovation Award.
* In 2015, Cipla stood third in the India&#x27;s Most Reputed Brands (Pharmaceutical) list, in a study conducted by BlueBytes, a Media Analytics firm in association with TRA Research, a brand insights organization (both part of the Comniscient Group).

==Criticism==

===Emergency contraception===
In August 2007, Cipla launched an emergency contraception drug &quot;i-pill&quot; sold over the counter. The drug sparked controversy as it was available without prescription and contained a large amount of API per dosage.

===Generic drugs===
In the late 1960s, Cipla began manufacturing a new, patented drug, propranolol, without the permission of the drug&#x27;s patent holder, Imperial Chemical Industries; a protest was filed with the Indian government. The CEO of Cipla pressured the government of Indira Gandhi to change India&#x27;s patent laws to eliminate patents that directly covered drugs, and instead to allow only patents that covered methods to make drugs so that Cipla could produce low-priced generic drugs. Since then, Cipla has also produced a low-cost drug to treat HIV, and expanded operations into several developing countries. The changes made led to criticism of both India&#x27;s patent laws and Cipla. India reinstated patents on drugs in 2005.

<doc id="592039" wikidata="Q3113157" url="?curid=592039" title="Rosewood massacre">
<text>The Rosewood massacre was a racially motivated massacre of black people and the destruction of a black town that took place during the first week of January 1923 in rural Levy County, Florida, United States. At least six black people were killed, but eyewitness accounts suggested a higher death toll of 27 to 150. In addition, two white people were killed in self-defense by one of the victims. The town of Rosewood was destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black men in the years before the massacre, including the lynching of Charles Strong and the Perry massacre in 1922.

Before the massacre, the town of Rosewood had been a quiet, primarily black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been assaulted by a black drifter. A mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. For several days, survivors from the town hid in nearby swamps until they were evacuated to larger towns by train and car. No arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black and white residents; none of them ever moved back and the town ceased to exist.

Although the rioting was widely reported around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event. The survivors, their descendants, and the perpetrators all remained silent about Rosewood for decades. Sixty years after the rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived by major media outlets when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. The survivors and their descendants all organized in an attempt to sue the state for failing to protect Rosewood&#x27;s black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned a report on the incident. As a result of the findings, Florida compensated the survivors and their descendants for the damages which they had incurred because of racial violence. The incident was the subject of a 1997 feature film which was directed by John Singleton. In 2004, the state designated the site of Rosewood as a Florida Heritage Landmark.

Officially, the recorded death toll during the first week of January 1923 was eight (six blacks and two whites). Some survivors&#x27; stories claim that up to 27 black residents were killed, and they also assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths. Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the Carrier house when it was besieged, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house. A newspaper article published in 1984 stated that estimates of up to 150 victims might have been exaggerations. Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave which was filled with the bodies of black people; one of them remembers seeing 26 bodies being covered with a plow which was brought from Cedar Key. However, by the time authorities investigated these claims, most of the witnesses were dead or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories.

== Background ==

=== Settlement ===
Rosewood was settled in 1847, nine miles (14 km) east of Cedar Key, near the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the local economy drew on the timber industry; the name Rosewood refers to the reddish color of cut cedar wood. Two pencil mills were founded nearby in Cedar Key; local residents also worked in several turpentine mills and a sawmill three miles (4.8 km) away in Sumner, in addition to farming of citrus and cotton. The hamlet grew enough to warrant the construction of a post office and train depot on the Florida Railroad in 1870, but it was never incorporated as a town.

Initially, Rosewood had both black and white settlers. When most of the cedar trees in the area had been cut by 1890, the pencil mills closed, and many white residents moved to Sumner. By 1900, the population in Rosewood had become predominantly black. The village of Sumner was predominantly white, and relations between the two communities were relatively amicable. Two black families in Rosewood named Goins and Carrier were the most powerful. The Goins family brought the turpentine industry to the area, and in the years preceding the attacks were the second largest landowners in Levy County. To avoid lawsuits from white competitors, the Goins brothers moved to Gainesville, and the population of Rosewood decreased slightly. The Carriers were also a large family, primarily working at logging in the region. By the 1920s, almost everyone in the close-knit community was distantly related to each other. The population of Rosewood peaked in 1915 at 355 people. Florida had effectively disenfranchised black voters since the start of the 20th century by high requirements for voter registration; both Sumner and Rosewood were part of a single voting precinct counted by the U.S. Census. In 1920, the combined population of both towns was 638 (344 black and 294 white).

As was common in the late 19th century South, Florida had imposed legal racial segregation under Jim Crow laws requiring separate black and white public facilities and transportation. Black and white residents created their own community centers: by 1920, the residents of Rosewood were mostly self-sufficient. They had three churches, a school, a large Masonic Hall, a turpentine mill, a sugarcane mill, a baseball team named the Rosewood Stars, and two general stores, one of which was white-owned. The village had about a dozen two-story wooden plank homes, other small two-room houses, and several small unoccupied plank farm and storage structures. Some families owned pianos, organs, and other symbols of middle-class prosperity. Survivors of Rosewood remember it as a happy place. In 1995, survivor Robie Mortin recalled at age 79 that when she was a child there, that &quot;Rosewood was a town where everyone&#x27;s house was painted. There were roses everywhere you walked. Lovely.&quot;

=== Racial tensions in Florida ===
Racial violence at the time was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means of social control throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens. Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democratic-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following. Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.
Elected officials in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location out of state for black people to live separately. Tens of thousands of people moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.

When U.S. troop training began for World War I, many white Southerners were alarmed at the thought of arming black soldiers. A confrontation regarding the rights of black soldiers culminated in the Houston Riot of 1917. German propaganda encouraged black soldiers to turn against their &quot;real&quot; enemies: American whites. Rumors reached the U.S. that French women had been sexually active with black American soldiers, which University of Florida historian David Colburn argues struck at the heart of Southern fears about power and miscegenation. Colburn connects growing concerns of sexual intimacy between the races to what occurred in Rosewood: &quot;Southern culture had been constructed around a set of mores and values which places white women at its center and in which the purity of their conduct and their manners represented the refinement of that culture. An attack on women not only represented a violation of the South&#x27;s foremost taboo, but it also threatened to dismantle the very nature of southern society.&quot; The transgression of sexual taboos subsequently combined with the arming of black citizens to raise fears among whites of an impending race war in the South.

The influx of black people into urban centers in the Northeast and Midwest increased racial tensions in those cities. Between 1917 and 1923, racial disturbances erupted in numerous cities throughout the U.S., motivated by economic competition between different racial groups for industrial jobs. One of the first and most violent instances was a riot in East St. Louis, sparked in 1917. In the Red Summer of 1919, racially motivated mob violence erupted in 23 cities—including Chicago, Omaha, and Washington, D.C.—caused by competition for jobs and housing by returning World War I veterans of both races, and the arrival of waves of new European immigrants. Further unrest occurred in Tulsa in 1921, when whites attacked the black Greenwood community. David Colburn distinguishes two types of violence against black people up to 1923: Northern violence was generally spontaneous mob action against entire communities. Southern violence, in contrast, took the form of individual incidents of lynchings and other extrajudicial actions. The Rosewood massacre, according to Colburn, resembled violence more commonly perpetrated in the North in those years.
In the mid-1920s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) reached its peak membership in the South and Midwest after a revival beginning around 1915. Its growth was due in part to tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities; in the Midwest and West, its growth was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tampa; Miami&#x27;s chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club. The Klan also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the Reconstruction era. An editor of &quot;The Gainesville Daily Sun&quot; admitted that he was a member of the Klan in 1922, and praised the organization in print.

Despite Governor Catts&#x27; change of attitude, white mob action frequently occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement. Extrajudicial violence against black residents was so common that it seldom was covered by newspapers. In 1920, whites removed four black men from jail, who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in Macclenny, and lynched them. In Ocoee the same year, two black citizens armed themselves to go to the polls during an election. A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot, after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee&#x27;s black community, causing as many as 30 deaths, and destroying 25 homes, two churches, and a Masonic Lodge. Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre, the Perry Race Riot occurred on December 14 and 15, 1922, in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry, Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered. On the day following Wright&#x27;s lynching, whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry; next they burned the town&#x27;s black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families&#x27; homes.

== Events in Rosewood ==

=== Fannie Taylor&#x27;s story ===
The Rosewood massacre occurred after a white woman in Sumner claimed she had been assaulted by a black man. Frances &quot;Fannie&quot; Taylor was 22 years old in 1923 and married to James, a 30-year-old millwright employed by Cummer &amp; Sons in Sumner. They lived there with their two young children. James&#x27; job required him to leave each day during the darkness of early morning. Neighbors remembered Fannie Taylor as &quot;very peculiar&quot;: she was meticulously clean, scrubbing her cedar floors with bleach so that they shone white. Other women attested that Taylor was aloof; no one knew her very well.

On January 1, 1923, the Taylors&#x27; neighbor reported that she heard a scream while it was still dark, grabbed her revolver and ran next door to find Fannie bruised and beaten, with scuff marks across the white floor. Taylor was screaming that someone needed to get her baby. She said a black man was in her house; he had come through the back door and assaulted her. The neighbor found the baby, but no one else. Taylor&#x27;s initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not rape her. Rumors circulated—widely believed by whites in Sumner—that she was both raped and robbed. The charge of rape of a white woman by a black man was inflammatory in the South: the day before, the Klan had held a parade and rally of over 100 hooded Klansmen away in Gainesville under a burning cross and a banner reading, &quot;First and Always Protect Womanhood&quot;.
The neighbor also reported the absence that day of Taylor&#x27;s laundress, Sarah Carrier, whom the white women in Sumner called &quot;Aunt Sarah&quot;. Philomena Goins, Carrier&#x27;s granddaughter, told a different story about Fannie Taylor many years later. She joined her grandmother Carrier at Taylor&#x27;s home as usual that morning. They watched a white man leave by the back door later in the morning before noon. She said Taylor did emerge from her home showing evidence of having been beaten, but it was well after morning. Carrier&#x27;s grandson and Philomena&#x27;s brother, Arnett Goins, sometimes went with them; he had seen the white man before. Carrier told others in the black community what she had seen that day; the black community of Rosewood believed that Fannie Taylor had a white lover, they got into a fight that day, and he beat her. When the man left Taylor&#x27;s house, he went to Rosewood.

Quickly, Levy County Sheriff Robert Elias Walker raised a posse and started an investigation. When they learned that Jesse Hunter, a black prisoner, had escaped from a chain gang, they began a search to question him about Taylor&#x27;s attack. Men arrived from Cedar Key, Otter Creek, Chiefland, and Bronson to help with the search. Adding confusion to the events recounted later, as many as 400 white men began to gather. Sheriff Walker deputized some of them, but was unable to initiate them all. Walker asked for dogs from a nearby convict camp, but one dog may have been used by a group of men acting without Walker&#x27;s authority. Dogs led a group of about 100 to 150 men to the home of Aaron Carrier, Sarah&#x27;s nephew. Aaron was taken outside, where his mother begged the men not to kill him. He was tied to a car and dragged to Sumner. Sheriff Walker put Carrier in protective custody at the county seat in Bronson to remove him from the men in the posse, many of whom were drinking and acting on their own authority. Worried that the group would quickly grow further out of control, Walker also urged black employees to stay at the turpentine mills for their own safety.

A group of white vigilantes, who had become a mob by this time, seized Sam Carter, a local blacksmith and teamster who worked in a turpentine still. They tortured Carter into admitting that he had hidden the escaped chain gang prisoner. Carter led the group to the spot in the woods where he said he had taken Hunter, but the dogs were unable to pick up a scent. To the surprise of many witnesses, someone fatally shot Carter in the face. The group hung Carter&#x27;s mutilated body from a tree as a symbol to other black men in the area. Some in the mob took souvenirs of his clothes. Survivors suggest that Taylor&#x27;s lover fled to Rosewood because he knew he was in trouble and had gone to the home of Aaron Carrier, a fellow veteran and Mason. Carrier and Carter, another Mason, covered the fugitive in the back of a wagon. Carter took him to a nearby river, let him out of the wagon, then returned home to be met by the mob, who was led by dogs following the fugitive&#x27;s scent.

After lynching Sam Carter, the mob met Sylvester Carrier—Aaron&#x27;s cousin and Sarah&#x27;s son—on a road and told him to get out of town. Carrier refused, and when the mob moved on, he suggested gathering as many people as possible for protection.

=== Escalation ===
Despite the efforts of Sheriff Walker and mill supervisor W. H. Pillsbury to disperse the mobs, white men continued to gather. On the evening of January 4, a mob of armed white men went to Rosewood and surrounded the house of Sarah Carrier. It was filled with approximately 15 to 25 people seeking refuge, including many children hiding upstairs under mattresses. Some of the children were in the house because they were visiting their grandmother for Christmas. They were protected by Sylvester Carrier and possibly two other men, but Carrier may have been the only one armed. He had a reputation of being proud and independent. In Rosewood, he was a formidable character, a crack shot, expert hunter, and music teacher, who was simply called &quot;Man&quot;. Many white people considered him arrogant and disrespectful.

Sylvester Carrier was reported in the &quot;New York Times&quot; saying that the attack on Fannie Taylor was an &quot;example of what negroes could do without interference&quot;. Whether or not he said this is debated, but a group of 20 to 30 white men, inflamed by the reported statement, went to the Carrier house. They believed that the black community in Rosewood was hiding escaped prisoner Jesse Hunter.

Reports conflict about who shot first, but after two members of the mob approached the house, someone opened fire. Sarah Carrier was shot in the head. Her nine-year-old niece at the house, Minnie Lee Langley, had witnessed Aaron Carrier taken from his house three days earlier. When Langley heard someone had been shot, she went downstairs to find her grandmother, Emma Carrier. Sylvester placed Minnie Lee in a firewood closet in front of him as he watched the front door, using the closet for cover: &quot;He got behind me in the wood [bin], and he put the gun on my shoulder, and them crackers was still shooting and going on. He put his gun on my shoulder ... told me to lean this way, and then Poly Wilkerson, he kicked the door down. When he kicked the door down, Cuz&#x27; Syl let him have it.&quot;

Several shots were exchanged: the house was riddled with bullets, but the whites did not capture it. The standoff lasted long into the next morning, when Sarah and Sylvester Carrier were found dead inside the house; several others were wounded, including a child who had been shot in the eye. Two white men, C. P. &quot;Poly&quot; Wilkerson and Henry Andrews, were killed; Wilkerson had kicked in the front door, and Andrews was behind him. At least four white men were wounded, one possibly fatally. The remaining children in the Carrier house were spirited out the back door into the woods. They crossed dirt roads one at a time, then hid under brush until they had all gathered away from Rosewood.

=== Razing Rosewood ===
News of the armed standoff at the Carrier house attracted white men from all over the state to take part. Reports were carried in the &quot;St. Petersburg Independent&quot;, the &quot;Florida Times-Union&quot;, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, and &quot;The Miami Metropolis&quot;, in versions of competing facts and overstatement. The &quot;Miami Metropolis&quot; listed 20 black people and four white people dead and characterized the event as a &quot;race war&quot;. National newspapers also put the incident on the front page. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;St. Louis Dispatch&quot; described a band of &quot;heavily armed Negroes&quot; and a &quot;negro desperado&quot; as being involved. Most of the information came from discreet messages from Sheriff Walker, mob rumors, and other embellishments to part-time reporters who wired their stories to the Associated Press. Details about the armed standoff were particularly explosive. According to historian Thomas Dye, &quot;The idea that blacks in Rosewood had taken up arms against the white race was unthinkable in the Deep South&quot;.

Black newspapers covered the events from a different angle. The &quot;Afro-American&quot; in Baltimore highlighted the acts of African-American heroism against the onslaught of &quot;savages&quot;. Another newspaper reported: &quot;Two Negro women were attacked and raped between Rosewood and Sumner. The sexual lust of the brutal white mobbists satisfied, the women were strangled.&quot;

The white mob burned black churches in Rosewood. Philomena Goins&#x27; cousin, Lee Ruth Davis, heard the bells tolling in the church as the men were inside setting it on fire. The mob also destroyed the white church in Rosewood. Many black residents fled for safety into the nearby swamps, some clothed only in their pajamas. Wilson Hall was nine years old at the time; he later recounted his mother waking him to escape into the swamps early in the morning when it was still dark; the lights from approaching cars of white men could be seen for miles. The Hall family walked through swampland to the town of Gulf Hammock. The survivors recall that it was uncharacteristically cold for Florida, and people suffered when they spent several nights in raised wooded areas called hammocks to evade the mob. Some took refuge with sympathetic white families. Sam Carter&#x27;s 69-year-old widow hid for two days in the swamps, then was driven by a sympathetic white mail carrier, under bags of mail, to join her family in Chiefland.

White men began surrounding houses, pouring kerosene on and lighting them, then shooting at those who emerged. Lexie Gordon, a light-skinned 50-year-old woman who was ill with typhoid fever, had sent her children into the woods. She was killed by a shotgun blast to the face when she fled from hiding underneath her home, which had been set on fire by the mob. Fannie Taylor&#x27;s brother-in-law claimed to be her killer. On January 5, more whites converged on the area, forming a mob of between 200 and 300 people. Some came from out of state. Mingo Williams, who was away near Bronson, was collecting turpentine sap by the side of the road when a car full of whites stopped and asked his name. As was custom among many residents of Levy County, both black and white, Williams used a nickname that was more prominent than his given name; when he gave his nickname of &quot;Lord God&quot;, they shot him dead.

Sheriff Walker pleaded with news reporters covering the violence to send a message to the Alachua County Sheriff P. G. Ramsey to send assistance. Carloads of men came from Gainesville to assist Walker; many of them had probably participated in the Klan rally earlier in the week. W. H. Pillsbury tried desperately to keep black workers in the Sumner mill, and worked with his assistant, a man named Johnson, to dissuade the white workers from joining others using extra-legal violence. Armed guards sent by Sheriff Walker turned away black people who emerged from the swamps and tried to go home. W. H. Pillsbury&#x27;s wife secretly helped smuggle people out of the area. Several white men declined to join the mobs, including the town barber who also refused to lend his gun to anyone. He said he did not want his &quot;hands wet with blood&quot;.

Governor Cary Hardee was on standby, ready to order National Guard troops in to neutralize the situation. Despite his message to the sheriff of Alachua County, Walker informed Hardee by telegram that he did not fear &quot;further disorder&quot; and urged the governor not to intervene. The governor&#x27;s office monitored the situation, in part because of intense Northern interest, but Hardee would not activate the National Guard without Walker&#x27;s request. Walker insisted he could handle the situation; records show that Governor Hardee took Sheriff Walker&#x27;s word and went on a hunting trip.

James Carrier, Sylvester&#x27;s brother and Sarah&#x27;s son, had previously suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed. He left the swamps and returned to Rosewood. He asked W. H. Pillsbury, the white turpentine mill supervisor, for protection; Pillsbury locked him in a house but the mob found Carrier, and tortured him to find out if he had aided Jesse Hunter, the escaped convict. After they made Carrier dig his own grave, they fatally shot him.

=== Evacuation ===

On January 6, white train conductors John and William Bryce managed the evacuation of some black residents to Gainesville. The brothers were independently wealthy Cedar Key residents who had an affinity for trains. They knew the people in Rosewood and had traded with them regularly. As they passed the area, the Bryces slowed their train and blew the horn, picking up women and children. Fearing reprisals from mobs, they refused to pick up any black men. Many survivors boarded the train after having been hidden by white general store owner John Wright and his wife, Mary Jo. Over the next several days, other Rosewood residents fled to Wright&#x27;s house, facilitated by Sheriff Walker, who asked Wright to transport as many residents out of town as possible.

Lee Ruth Davis, her sister, and two brothers were hidden by the Wrights while their father hid in the woods. On the morning of Poly Wilkerson&#x27;s funeral, the Wrights left the children alone to attend. Davis and her siblings crept out of the house to hide with relatives in the nearby town of Wylly, but they were turned back for being too dangerous. The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights&#x27; house. After spotting men with guns on their way back, they crept back to the Wrights, who were frantic with fear. Davis later described the experience: &quot;I was laying that deep in water, that is where we sat all day long ... We got on our bellies and crawled. We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes ... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house. After we got all the way to his house, Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes hollering and calling us, and when we answered, they were so glad.&quot; Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town. Gainesville&#x27;s black community took in many of Rosewood&#x27;s evacuees, waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked, covered in sheets. On Sunday, January 7, a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood.

=== Response ===

Many people were alarmed by the violence, and state leaders feared negative effects on the state&#x27;s tourist industry. Governor Cary Hardee appointed a special grand jury and special prosecuting attorney to investigate the outbreak in Rosewood and other incidents in Levy County. In February 1923, the all-white grand jury convened in Bronson. Over several days, they heard 25 witnesses, eight of whom were black, but found insufficient evidence to prosecute any perpetrators. The judge presiding over the case deplored the actions of the mob.

By the end of the week, Rosewood no longer made the front pages of major white newspapers. The &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;, the most influential black newspaper in the U.S., reported that 19 people in Rosewood&#x27;s &quot;race war&quot; had died, and a soldier named Ted Cole appeared to fight the lynch mobs, then disappeared; no confirmation of his existence after this report exists. A few editorials appeared in Florida newspapers summarizing the event. &quot;The Gainesville Daily Sun&quot; justified the actions of whites involved, writing &quot;Let it be understood now and forever that he, whether white or black, who brutally assaults an innocent and helpless woman, shall die the death of a dog.&quot; The &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot;, in a rare comment on the excesses of whites in the area, called it &quot;a foul and lasting blot on the people of Levy County&quot;.

Northern publications were more willing to note the breakdown of law, but many attributed it to the backward mindset in the South. The &quot;New York Call,&quot; a socialist newspaper, remarked &quot;how astonishingly little cultural progress has been made in some parts of the world&quot;, while the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; compared the events in Rosewood to recent race riots in Northern cities, but characterized the entire event as &quot;deplorable&quot;. A three-day conference in Atlanta organized by the Southern Methodist Church released a statement that similarly condemned the chaotic week in Rosewood. It concluded, &quot;No family and no race rises higher than womanhood. Hence, the intelligence of women must be cultivated and the purity and dignity of womanhood must be protected by the maintenance of a single standard of morals for both races.&quot;

Officially, the recorded death toll of the first week of January 1923 was eight people (six black and two white). Historians disagree about this number. Some survivors&#x27; stories claim there may have been up to 27 black residents killed, and assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths. Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the Carrier house siege, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house. Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people; one remembers a plow brought from Cedar Key that covered 26 bodies. However, by the time authorities investigated these claims, most of the witnesses were dead, or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories.

Aaron Carrier was held in jail for several months in early 1923; he died in 1965. James Carrier&#x27;s widow Emma was shot in the hand and the wrist and reached Gainesville by train. She never recovered, and died in 1924. Sarah Carrier&#x27;s husband Haywood did not see the events in Rosewood. He was on a hunting trip, and discovered when he returned that his wife, brother James, and son Sylvester had all been killed and his house destroyed by a white mob. Following the shock of learning what had happened in Rosewood, Haywood rarely spoke to anyone but himself; he sometimes wandered away from his family unclothed. His grandson, Arnett Goins, thought that he had been unhinged by grief. Haywood Carrier died a year after the massacre. Jesse Hunter, the escaped convict, was never found. Many survivors fled in different directions to other cities, and a few changed their names from fear that whites would track them down. None ever returned to live in Rosewood.

Fannie Taylor and her husband moved to another mill town. She was &quot;very nervous&quot; in her later years, until she succumbed to cancer. John Wright&#x27;s house was the only structure left standing in Rosewood. He lived in it and acted as an emissary between the county and the survivors. After they left the town, almost all of their land was sold for taxes. Mary Jo Wright died around 1931; John developed a problem with alcohol. He was ostracized and taunted for assisting the survivors, and rumored to keep a gun in every room of his house. He died after drinking too much one night in Cedar Key, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Sumner. The sawmill in Sumner burned down in 1925, and the owners moved the operation to Lacoochee in Pasco County. Some survivors as well as participants in the mob action went to Lacoochee to work in the mill there. W. H. Pillsbury was among them, and he was taunted by former Sumner residents. No longer having any supervisory authority, Pillsbury was retired early by the company. He moved to Jacksonville and died in 1926.

== Culture of silence ==
Despite nationwide news coverage in both white and black newspapers, the incident, and the small abandoned village, slipped into oblivion. Most of the survivors scattered around Florida cities and started over with nothing. Many, including children, took on odd jobs to make ends meet. Education had to be sacrificed to earn an income. As a result, most of the Rosewood survivors took on manual labor jobs, working as maids, shoe shiners, or in citrus factories or lumber mills.

Although the survivors&#x27; experiences after Rosewood were disparate, none publicly acknowledged what had happened. Robie Mortin, Sam Carter&#x27;s niece, was seven years old when her father put her on a train to Chiefland, east of Rosewood, on January 3, 1923. Mortin&#x27;s father avoided the heart of Rosewood on the way to the depot that day, a decision Mortin believes saved their lives. Mortin&#x27;s father met them years later in Riviera Beach, in South Florida. None of the family ever spoke about the events in Rosewood, on order from Mortin&#x27;s grandmother: &quot;She felt like maybe if somebody knew where we came from, they might come at us&quot;.

This silence was an exception to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want them to know what I came through and I didn&#x27;t discuss it with none of them ... I just didn&#x27;t want them to know what kind of way I come up. I didn&#x27;t want them to know white folks want us out of our homes.&quot; Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother&#x27;s story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.

In 1982, an investigative reporter named Gary Moore from the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; drove from the Tampa area to Cedar Key looking for a story. When he commented to a local on the &quot;gloomy atmosphere&quot; of Cedar Key, and questioned why a Southern town was all-white when at the start of the 20th century it had been nearly half black, the local woman replied, &quot;I know what you&#x27;re digging for. You&#x27;re trying to get me to talk about that massacre.&quot; Moore was hooked. He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother. Moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history: &quot;After a week of sensation, the weeks of January 1923 seem to have dropped completely from Florida&#x27;s consciousness, like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet&quot;.

When Philomena Goins Doctor found out what her son had done, she became enraged and threatened to disown him, shook him, then slapped him. A year later, Moore took the story to CBS&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African-American journalist Ed Bradley. Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore&#x27;s story and Bradley&#x27;s television exposé were full of lies. A psychologist at the University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder, made worse by the secrecy. Many years after the incident, they exhibited fear, denial, and hypervigilance about socializing with whites—which they expressed specifically regarding their children, interspersed with bouts of apathy. Despite such characteristics, survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood, to keep them from becoming bitter. Michael D&#x27;Orso, who wrote a book about Rosewood, said, &quot;[E]veryone told me in their own way, in their own words, that if they allowed themselves to be bitter, to hate, it would have eaten them up.&quot; Robie Mortin described her past this way: &quot;I knew that something went very wrong in my life because it took a lot away from me. But I wasn&#x27;t angry or anything.&quot;

The legacy of Rosewood remained in Levy County. For decades no black residents lived in Cedar Key or Sumner. Robin Raftis, the white editor of the &quot;Cedar Key Beacon&quot;, tried to place the events in an open forum by printing Moore&#x27;s story. She had been collecting anecdotes for many years, and said, &quot;Things happened out there in the woods. There&#x27;s no doubt about that. How bad? We don&#x27;t know ... So I said, &#x27;Okay guys, I&#x27;m opening the closet with the skeletons, because if we don&#x27;t learn from mistakes, we&#x27;re doomed to repeat them&#x27;.&quot; Raftis received notes reading, &quot;We know how to get you and your kids. All it takes is a match&quot;. 
University of Florida historian David Colburn stated, &quot;There is a pattern of denial with the residents and their relatives about what took place, and in fact they said to us on several occasions they don&#x27;t want to talk about it, they don&#x27;t want to identify anyone involved, and there&#x27;s also a tendency to say that those who were involved were from elsewhere.&quot;

In 1993, a black couple retired to Rosewood from Washington D.C. They told &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;When we used to have black friends down from Chiefland, they always wanted to leave before it got dark. They didn&#x27;t want to be in Rosewood after dark. We always asked, but folks wouldn&#x27;t say why.&quot;

== Seeking justice ==

=== History includes Rosewood ===
Philomena Goins Doctor died in 1991. Her son Arnett was, by that time, &quot;obsessed&quot; with the events in Rosewood. Although he was originally excluded from the Rosewood claims case, he was included after this was revealed by publicity. By that point, the case had been taken on a &quot;pro bono&quot; basis by one of Florida&#x27;s largest legal firms. In 1993, the firm filed a lawsuit on behalf of Arnett Goins, Minnie Lee Langley, and other survivors against the state government for its failure to protect them and their families.

Survivors participated in a publicity campaign to expand attention to the case. Langley and Lee Ruth Davis appeared on &quot;The Maury Povich Show&quot; on Martin Luther King Day in 1993. Gary Moore published another article about Rosewood in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; on March 7, 1993; he had to negotiate with the newspaper&#x27;s editors for about a year to publish it. At first they were skeptical that the incident had taken place, and secondly, reporter Lori Rosza of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; had reported on the first stage of what proved in December 1992 to be a deceptive claims case, with most of the survivors excluded. &quot;If something like that really happened, we figured, it would be all over the history books&quot;, an editor wrote.

Arnett Doctor told the story of Rosewood to print and television reporters from all over the world. He raised the number of historic residents in Rosewood, as well as the number who died at the Carrier house siege; he exaggerated the town&#x27;s contemporary importance by comparing it to Atlanta, Georgia as a cultural center. Doctor wanted to keep Rosewood in the news; his accounts were printed with few changes. According to historian Thomas Dye, Doctor&#x27;s &quot;forceful addresses to groups across the state, including the NAACP, together with his many articulate and heart-rending television appearances, placed intense pressure on the legislature ... to do something about Rosewood&quot;. In December 1996, Doctor told a meeting at Jacksonville Beach that 30 women and children had been buried alive at Rosewood, and that his facts had been confirmed by journalist Gary Moore. He was embarrassed to learn that Moore was in the audience. As the Holland &amp; Knight law firm continued the claims case, they represented 13 survivors, people who had lived in Rosewood at the time of the 1923 violence, in the claim to the legislature.

The lawsuit missed the filing deadline of January 1, 1993. The speaker of the Florida House of Representatives commissioned a group to research and provide a report by which the equitable claim bill could be evaluated. It took them nearly a year to do the research, including interviews, and writing. On December 22, 1993, historians from Florida State University, Florida A&amp;M University, and the University of Florida delivered a 100-page report (with 400 pages of attached documentation) on the Rosewood massacre. It was based on available primary documents, and interviews mostly with black survivors of the incident. Due to the media attention received by residents of Cedar Key and Sumner following filing of the claim by survivors, white participants were discouraged from offering interviews to the historians. The report used a taped description of the events by Jason McElveen, a Cedar Key resident who had since died, and an interview with Ernest Parham, who was in high school in 1923 and happened upon the lynching of Sam Carter. Parham said he had never spoken of the incident because he was never asked. The report was titled &quot;Documented History of the Incident which Occurred at Rosewood, Florida in January 1923&quot;. Gary Moore, the investigative journalist who wrote the 1982 story in &quot;The St. Petersburg Times&quot; that reopened the Rosewood case, criticized demonstrable errors in the report. The commissioned group retracted the most serious of these, without public discussion. They delivered the final report to the Florida Board of Regents and it became part of the legislative record.

=== Rosewood victims v. the State of Florida ===
Florida&#x27;s consideration of a bill to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any U.S. state. Opponents argued that the bill set a dangerous precedent and put the onus of paying survivors and descendants on Floridians who had nothing to do with the incident in Rosewood. James Peters, who represented the State of Florida, argued that the statute of limitations applied because the law enforcement officials named in the lawsuit—Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee—had died many years before. He also called into question the shortcomings of the report: although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind, they offered conclusions about the actions of Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee. The report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts; they relied in cases on information that was hearsay from witnesses who had since died. Critics thought that some of the report&#x27;s writers asked leading questions in their interviews.

Even legislators who agreed with the sentiment of the bill asserted that the events in Rosewood were typical of the era. One survivor interviewed by Gary Moore said that to single out Rosewood as an exception, as if the entire world was not a Rosewood, would be &quot;vile&quot;. State legislators who supported the bill Democrat Al Lawson and Republican Miguel De Grandy, argued that, unlike Native Americans or slaves who had suffered atrocities at the hands of whites, the residents of Rosewood were tax-paying, self-sufficient citizens who deserved the protection of local and state law enforcement. While mob lynchings of black people around the same time tended to be spontaneous and quickly concluded, the incident at Rosewood was prolonged over a period of several days. Some legislators began to receive hate mail, including some claiming to be from Ku Klux Klan members. One legislator remarked that his office received an unprecedented response to the bill, with a proportion of ten constituents to one opposing it.

In 1994, the state legislature held a hearing to discuss the merits of the bill. Lee Ruth Davis died a few months before testimony began, but Minnie Lee Langley, Arnett Goins, Wilson Hall, Willie Evans, and several descendants from Rosewood testified. Other witnesses were a clinical psychologist from the University of Florida, who testified that survivors had suffered post-traumatic stress, and experts who offered testimony about the scale of property damages. Langley spoke first; the hearing room was packed with journalists and onlookers who were reportedly mesmerized by her statement. Ernest Parham also testified about what he saw. When asked specifically when he was contacted by law enforcement regarding the death of Sam Carter, Parham replied that he had been contacted for the first time on Carter&#x27;s death two weeks before testifying. The coroner&#x27;s inquest for Sam Carter had taken place the day after he was shot in January 1923; he concluded that Carter had been killed &quot;by Unknown Party&quot;.

After hearing all the evidence, the Special Master Richard Hixson, who presided over the testimony for the Florida Legislature, declared that the state had a &quot;moral obligation&quot; to make restitution to the former residents of Rosewood. He said, &quot;I truly don&#x27;t think they cared about compensation. I think they simply wanted the truth to be known about what happened to them ... whether they got fifty cents or a hundred and fifty million dollars. It didn&#x27;t matter.&quot;

Black and Hispanic legislators in Florida took on the Rosewood compensation bill as a cause, and refused to support Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles&#x27; healthcare plan until he put pressure on the Democrat controlled state assembly to vote in favor of the bill. Chiles was offended, as he had supported the compensation bill from its early days, and the legislative caucuses had previously promised their support for his healthcare plan. The legislature passed the bill, and Governor Chiles signed the Rosewood Compensation Bill, a $2.1 million package to compensate survivors and their descendants. Seven survivors and their family members were present at the signing to hear Chiles say

Because of the strength and commitment of these survivors and their families, the long silence has finally been broken and the shadow has been lifted ... Instead of being forgotten, because of their testimony, the Rosewood story is known across our state and across our nation. This legislation assures that the tragedy of Rosewood will never be forgotten by the generations to come.

Originally, the compensation total offered to survivors was $7 million, which aroused controversy. The legislature eventually settled on $1.5 million: this would enable payment of $150,000 to each person who could prove he or she lived in Rosewood during 1923, and provide a $500,000 pool for people who could apply for the funds after demonstrating that they had an ancestor who owned property in Rosewood during the same time. The four survivors who testified automatically qualified; four others had to apply. More than 400 applications were received from around the world.

Robie Mortin came forward as a survivor during this period; she was the only one added to the list who could prove that she had lived in Rosewood in 1923, totaling nine survivors who were compensated. Gaining compensation changed some families, whose members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding in order to avoid the press or friends and relatives who asked them for handouts. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among their siblings, received not much more than $100 each. Later, the Florida Department of Education set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities.

==Rosewood remembered ==
=== Representation in other media===
The Rosewood massacre, the ensuing silence, and the compensation hearing were the subject of the 1996 book titled &quot;Like Judgment Day: The Ruin and Redemption of a Town Called Rosewood&quot; by Mike D&#x27;Orso. It was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller and won the Lillian Smith Book Award, bestowed by the University of Georgia Libraries and the Southern Regional Council to authors who highlight racial and social inequality in their works.

The dramatic feature film &quot;Rosewood&quot; (1997), directed by John Singleton, was based on these historic events. Minnie Lee Langley served as a source for the set designers, and Arnett Doctor was hired as a consultant. Recreated forms of the towns of Rosewood and Sumner were built in Central Florida, far away from Levy County. The film version, written by screenwriter Gregory Poirier, created a character named Mann, who enters Rosewood as a type of reluctant Western-style hero. Composites of historic figures were used as characters, and the film offers the possibility of a happy ending. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; E.R. Shipp suggests that Singleton&#x27;s youth and his background in California contributed to his willingness to take on the story of Rosewood. She notes Singleton&#x27;s rejection of the image of black people as victims and the portrayal of &quot;an idyllic past in which black families are intact, loving and prosperous, and a black superhero who changes the course of history when he escapes the noose, takes on the mob with double-barreled ferocity and saves many women and children from death&quot;. Singleton has offered his view: &quot;I had a very deep—I wouldn&#x27;t call it fear—but a deep contempt for the South because I felt that so much of the horror and evil that black people have faced in this country is rooted here ... So in some ways this is my way of dealing with the whole thing.&quot;

Reception of the film was mixed. Shipp commented on Singleton&#x27;s creating a fictional account of Rosewood events, saying that the film &quot;assumes a lot and then makes up a lot more&quot;. The film version alludes to many more deaths than the highest counts by eyewitnesses. Gary Moore believes that creating an outside character who inspires the citizens of Rosewood to fight back condescends to survivors, and he criticized the inflated death toll specifically, saying the film was &quot;an interesting experience in illusion&quot;. In contrast, in 2001 Stanley Crouch of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described &quot;Rosewood&quot; as Singleton&#x27;s finest work, writing, &quot;Never in the history of American film had Southern racist hysteria been shown so clearly. Color, class and sex were woven together on a level that Faulkner would have appreciated.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
The State of Florida declared Rosewood a Florida Heritage Landmark in 2004 and subsequently erected a historical marker on State Road 24 that names the victims and describes the community&#x27;s destruction. Scattered structures remain within the community, including a church, a business, and a few homes, notably John Wright&#x27;s. Mary Hall Daniels, the last known survivor of the massacre at the time of her death, died at the age of 98 in Jacksonville, Florida, on May 2, 2018. Vera Goins-Hamilton, who had not previously been publicly identified as a survivor of the Rosewood massacre, died at the age of 100 in Lacoochee, Florida, in 2020. 

Rosewood descendants formed the Rosewood Heritage Foundation and the Real Rosewood Foundation, Inc., in order to educate people both in Florida and all over the world about the massacre. The Rosewood Heritage Foundation created a traveling exhibit that tours internationally in order to share the history of Rosewood and the attacks; a permanent display is housed in the library of Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach. The Real Rosewood Foundation presents a variety of humanitarian awards to people in Central Florida who help preserve Rosewood&#x27;s history. The organization also recognized Rosewood residents who protected blacks during the attacks by presenting an Unsung Heroes Award to the descendants of Sheriff Robert Walker, John Bryce, and William Bryce. Lizzie Jenkins, executive director of the Real Rosewood Foundation and niece of the Rosewood schoolteacher, explained her interest in keeping Rosewood&#x27;s legacy current: 

It has been a struggle telling this story over the years, because a lot of people don&#x27;t want to hear about this kind of history. People don&#x27;t relate to it, or just don&#x27;t want to hear about it. But Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it ... It&#x27;s a sad story, but it&#x27;s one I think everyone needs to hear.

The Real Rosewood Foundation, Inc., under the leadership of Jenkins, is raising funds to move John Wright&#x27;s house to nearby Archer, Florida, and make it a museum.

The state of Florida in 2020 established a Rosewood Family Scholarship Program, paying up to $6,100 each to up to 50 students each year who are direct descendants of Rosewood families.

<text>The American Community Survey (ACS) is an annual demographics survey program conducted by the United States Census Bureau. It regularly gathers information previously contained only in the long form of the decennial census, including ancestry, US citizenship status, educational attainment, income, language proficiency, migration, disability, employment, and housing characteristics. No respondents personal information is released, and only used statistically in these data which are used by many public-sector, private-sector, and not-for-profit stakeholders to allocate funding, track shifting demographics, plan for emergencies, and learn about local communities.

Sent to approximately 295,000 addresses monthly, or 3.5 million addresses annually, it is the largest household survey that the Census Bureau administers.

The American Community Survey gathers information annually in the 50 U.S. states, the federal national capital city of Washington, D.C. and the associated Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea (via the Puerto Rico Community Survey (PRCS), which is part of the ACS). It does not gather information in the other four major U.S. territories / commonwealths and associated states of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands in the western Pacific Ocean, and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea.

==History==
The Article I, Section II of the Constitution of the United States of 1787, adopted 1788, requires an enumeration of the population every ten years &quot;in such Manner as they (Congress) shall by Law direct&quot;. From the first United States Decennial Census three years later in 1790, congressional legislators understood that it should also collect basic demographic information beyond just the number of people in the household. James Madison, an American Founding Father and the fourth President of the United States, first proposed including additional questions in the U.S. Decennial Census to &quot;enable them to adapt the public measures to the particular circumstances of the community&quot;. Such knowledge collected with each census, President Madison argued, &quot;would give them an opportunity of marking the progress of the society&quot;. The questions included in censuses since 1790 have reflected American understandings of and concerns about societal trends and the growing nation&#x27;s expanded data needs.

By 130 years later in 1940, advancements in statistical methods and knowledge enabled the administrators and statisticians / mathematicians of the United States Census Bureau (Bureau of the Census), first established in 1902 within the United States Department of Commerce, to begin asking a sample of the American population a sub-set of additional detailed questions without unduly increasing cost or respondent burden. In the decades that followed, new questions were added to those that had previously been asked of all respondents, and all the questions were moved to the sample questionnaire form. As the sample form grew longer than the census form itself, it became known as the Census &quot;long form&quot;.

Following the 1960 U.S. Decennial Census, federal, state, and local governmental officials, and some in the private sector began demanding more timely long-form-type data. Lawmakers representing rural districts claimed they were at a data disadvantage, unable to self-fund additional surveys of their populations. Congress explored the creation of a mid-decade census, holding hearings and even authorizing a special mid-decade census in the American Bicentennial year of 1976, but not funding it.

Efforts to obtain data on a more frequent basis began again after the 1990 U.S. Decennial Census, when it became clear that the more burdensome long form was depressing overall census response rates and jeopardizing the accuracy of the count. At the Congress&#x27;s request, the U.S. Census Bureau in the United States Department of Commerce, developed and tested a new design to obtain long-form data. Noted U.S. statistician / mathematician Leslie Kish, had introduced the concept of a rolling sample (or continuous measurement) design in 1981. This design featured ongoing, monthly data collection aggregated on a yearly basis, enabling annual data releases. By combining multiple years of this data, the Census Bureau could release &quot;period&quot; estimates to produce estimates for smaller areas. After a decade of testing, it launched as the American Community Survey in 2005, replacing the once-a-decade census long form.

==Implementation==
The American Community Survey initially sampled approximately 3.5 million housing unit addresses and group quarters in the United States. The Census Bureau selects a random sample of addresses to be included in the ACS. Each address has about a 1-in-480 chance of being selected in a given month, and no address should be selected more than once every five years. Data is collected by internet, mail, telephone interviews, and in-person interviews. The questionnaire is available in English and Spanish, with assistance provided in additional languages. Approximately one-third of those who do not respond to the survey by mail or telephone are randomly selected for in-person interviews. About 95 percent of households across all response modes ultimately participate in the survey.

Like the decennial census, ACS responses are confidential. Every employee at the Census Bureau takes an oath of nondisclosure and is sworn for life to not disclose identifying information. Violations of the nondisclosure oath are punishable by prison sentences of up to five years and/or a $250,000 fine. Under , census responses are &quot;immune from legal process&quot; and may not &quot;be admitted as evidence or used for any purpose in any action, suit, or other judicial or administrative proceeding&quot;.

==Data availability==
The Census Bureau aggregates individual ACS responses, also known as microdata, into estimates at many geographic summary levels. Among these summary levels are legal and administrative entities such as states, counties, cities, and congressional districts, as well as statistical entities such as metropolitan statistical areas, tracts, block groups, and census designated places. Estimates for census blocks are not available from ACS. Puerto Rico is the only US territory that is part of the ACS program.

In order to balance geographic resolution, temporal frequency, statistical significance, and respondent privacy, ACS estimates released each year are aggregated from responses received in the previous calendar year or the previous five calendar years. The Census Bureau provides guidance for data users about which data set to use when analyzing different population and geography sizes.

From 2007 to 2013, three-year estimates were available for areas with 20,000 people or more. This data product was discontinued in 2015 due to budget cuts. The last 3-year release was the 2011–2013 ACS 3-year estimates.

Current data releases include:
* 1-year estimates are available for areas with a population of at least 65,000 people. The 2015 ACS 1-year estimates were released in 2016 and summarize responses received in 2015 for all states but only 26% of counties due to the 65,000 minimum population threshold. This is most suitable for data users interested in shorter-term changes at medium to large geographic scales.
* Supplemental estimates are shown in annual tables summarizing populations for geographies with populations of 20,000 or more.
* 5-year estimates are available for areas down to the block group scale, on the order of 600 to 3000 people. The 2015 ACS 5-year estimates, summarizing data from 2011 to 2015, were released in 2016.

Over the past decade, the American Community Survey has collected and supplied all data at local levels. This was a large breakthrough in the survey because it allows American citizens more individualized data on a community level as opposed to extrapolating from data collected over a larger area. It has also provided unparalleled information to be more accessible for local government planning and financing. Many conclusions for local data are averaged from various information across the area, but it is not always an adequate representation.

ACS estimates are available via a number of online data tools. U.S. Census website (AFF) is the primary tool for disseminating ACS data, allowing users to drill down to specific tables and geographies (starting with 2013 estimates, AFF also includes block group data). A selection of the most popular tables is shown in QuickFacts. Other tools include OnTheMap for Emergency Management, Census Business Builder and My Congressional District. My Tribal Area featuring 5-year estimates for federally recognized tribes, launched in 2017. The Summary File is the most detailed data source and is available as a series of downloadable text files or through an application programming interface (API) for software developers.

Custom cross-tabulations of ACS questions can be made using the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), freely accessible through the Census Bureau website and Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. PUMS data contain responses to every question from a sample of respondents. To protect respondent privacy, PUMS data are anonymized and only available down to areas containing 100,000 people or more known as Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). The analysis of all ACS microdata without the sampling and anonymization in PUMS is restricted to qualified researchers at secure Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs).

==Research studies==
The Census Bureau conducts research and evaluation projects, including survey methodology research, important for the improvement of the ACS.

The ACS data is used by researchers to examine societal changes, study data quality, and conduct methodological research.

==Controversy==

===Support===
American Community Survey data provides important information that cannot be found elsewhere. The federal government, as well as various businesses, researchers, and local governments use ACS data for planning and decision-making purposes. ACS data are used by public and business decision-makers to more clearly identify issues and opportunities and more effectively allocate scarce resources to address them. In Fiscal Year 2008, 184 federal domestic assistance programs used ACS-related datasets to help guide the distribution of $416 billion, 29 percent of all federal assistance.

The American Community Survey is authorized by 13 U.S.C. § 141 and 13 U.S.C. § 193. Federal courts have held that the long form is constitutional.

In 2000, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas ruled that the 2000 U.S. Decennial Census and its questions did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or any other constitutional provisions that were alleged in the federal lawsuit initiated by the plaintiffs. The federal district court said responses to census questions are not a violation of an American citizen&#x27;s right to privacy or free speech.

The U.S. District Court&#x27;s decision in Texas was later affirmed by the higher United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on appeal, and the Supreme Court of the United States denied the petition for a writ of certiorari. A number of other courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have held through the years that the Census and the questions in the Census are authorized by both the Constitution and Congressional statute.

In 2002, the General Accounting Office confirmed that the U.S. Census Bureau has authority to conduct the survey and &quot;require responses from the public&quot;. All individual American Community Survey responses are kept private and are used (along with other ACS responses) to create estimates of demographic characteristics for various geographies. Because of data swapping techniques to ensure confidentiality, it is impossible to figure out how individual people responded based on data from published ACS estimates.

===Opposition===
Opponents of the American Community Survey disagree with the court&#x27;s findings about its constitutionality, contending that the survey asks for more information and at a higher frequency than the simple enumeration authorized and required by Article 1, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution. Despite the Government Accountability Office&#x27;s conclusion that the U.S. Census Bureau has the authority to conduct the survey under and , several US representatives have challenged the ACS as unauthorized by the Census Act and a violation of the Right to Financial Privacy Act. U.S. Representative (congressman) Ron Paul of Texas, who opposes ACS, said that the founding fathers of the United States &quot;never authorized the federal government to continuously survey the American people&quot;.

Those who decline to complete the survey may receive visits to their homes from Census Bureau personnel. Because it is a mandatory survey, it is governed by federal laws that could impose a fine of as much as $5,000 on those who flagrantly refuse to participate.

To date, no person has been prosecuted for refusing to answer the ACS. Kenneth Prewitt, the former director of the U.S. Census Bureau, said in March 2000 that the United States Department of Commerce is &quot;not an enforcement agency&quot; and that the parallel United States Department of Justice in the presidential cabinet would be responsible for prosecuting violations, adding that &quot;we don&#x27;t recommend that&quot;. The Census Bureau prefers to gain cooperation by convincing respondents of the importance of participation while acknowledging that the mandate improves response rates (and thus accuracy) and lowers the annual cost of survey administration by more than $90 million.

In 2014, the Census Project, a collaboration of pro-Census business and industry associations, gathered signatures from 96 national and local organizations urging the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to reject a proposal to make the American Community Survey voluntary. Signers included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Realtors, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The letter cited results from a congressionally mandated test of a voluntary ACS that found that mail response rates would drop &quot;dramatically,&quot; by more than 20 percentage points. The resulting loss in quality and reliability would essentially eliminate data for 41 percent of US counties, small cities, towns and villages, many school districts, neighborhoods, remote areas, and American Indian reservations.

<doc id="592044" wikidata="Q261041" url="?curid=592044" title="Margherita Sarfatti">
<text>Margherita Sarfatti (; ; 8 April 1880 – 30 October 1961) was an Italian journalist, art critic, patron, collector, socialite, and prominent propaganda adviser of the National Fascist Party. She was Benito Mussolini&#x27;s biographer as well as one of his mistresses.

== Biography ==
Margherita Grassini was born in Venice to a Jewish family, the daughter of Amedeo Grassini and Emma Levi (whose cousin Giuseppe Levi was the father of Natalia Ginzburg). Amedeo was a wealthy lawyer and businessman and a former fiscal attorney for the Venetian government. He was a close friend of Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, later Pope Pius X. Amadeo would further be made a Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy.

Margherita grew up in a &quot;palazzo&quot; situated at the Canal Grande in Venice and was educated by private tutors. However, she was soon attracted by socialist ideas and escaped her parents&#x27; home at age 18 to marry Cesare Sarfatti, a Jewish lawyer from Padua. He was 13 years her senior, but shared her socialist beliefs. In 1902, the couple moved to Milan. There, they became prominent in the city&#x27;s artistic life, hosting weekly Salons that became the centre of the Futurist and Novecento Italiano artistic movements. The Salons took place at the number 93 of Corso Venezia. Present at these gatherings were Mussolini, Massimo Bontempelli, Ada Negri, and the sculptors Medardo Rosso and Arturo Martini. Margherita Sarfatti and her husband had several children. Their eldest son, Robert, enlisted in the Italian army during World War I, and was killed in action on Monte Baldo in January 1918, aged 18.

Personal friend and private collector of the right-wing avanguardist Umberto Boccioni, in 1911 Sarfatti met Benito Mussolini (three years her junior) and started a relationship with him. During this time she was working as an art critic at the socialist newspaper Avanti! which at the time was directed by Mussolini. After losing her husband in 1924, she wrote a biography of Mussolini. This was first published in 1925 in Britain under the title &quot;The Life of Benito Mussolini&quot;; it was published the following year in Italy with the title &quot;Dux&quot;. Because of the fame of Mussolini and the author&#x27;s familiarity with the dictator, the book was a success. Seventeen editions were printed and it was translated into 18 languages.

Sarfatti is memorialized in Guido Cadorin frescoes in the (now called) Grand Hotel Palace, Via Veneto No. 70, Rome. &quot;Fiammetta and I wanted to pass into immortality in the salon&#x27;s frescoes,&quot; she remarked, referring to her daughter, who is portrayed with her in the frescoes. 

Sarfatti had an influence over Mussolini&#x27;s policies from 1922 until 1938, when Mussolini bowed to German pressure and enacted racial legislation through the Manifesto of Race; until then, the fascist government&#x27;s politics were not antisemitic, and the party&#x27;s membership rolls were open to Jews. From 1927 she contributed to the Heidelberg-based magazine &quot;Italien&quot; which had been established with the support of Mussolini. In 1922, the group Novecento was enlarged to Anselmo Bucci, Leonardo Dudreville, Achille Funi, Gian Emilio Malerba, Pietro Marussig, Ubaldo Oppi, and Mario Sironi. She had contacts and personal knowledge of more exponents of the Italian Freemasonry, which Mussolini affirmed to badly tolerate.
By 1930 Sarfatti converted to Catholicism, and noted that Mussolini was cheating on her with younger women, and expelled her from whatever influence she had. By 1938, with the application of racial laws, she left Italy, first to Switzerland, and then alone for Argentina and Uruguay. She took with her the 1272 letters from Mussolini. she worked as a journalist for the newspaper &quot;El Diario&quot; of Montevideo. After the war, in 1947, Sarfatti returned to her home country and once again became an influential force in Italian art. Her children who remained in Italy survived the war, but her sister with her husband were extradited to the fascist forces and perished on the way to Auschwitz.

== In popular culture ==
Actress Susan Sarandon portrayed Sarfatti in the 1999 movie &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot;, written and directed by Sarandon&#x27;s then longtime companion, Tim Robbins. Sarandon discussed her role, saying: 
Margherita is someone who is a legitimate historical figure. She really existed. She really was Mussolini&#x27;s mistress and was very involved in the cultural shaping of Italy&#x27;s art movements. She was a patron of new painters in Italy. She came over to the United States to sell Mussolini to the American people, and she did that by using Hearst&#x27;s column. She wrote a column, and that was how they prepared the United States people for the concept of entering the war on the side of Mussolini, I suppose. And also, she was trying to fund the war.

And the complication of this was the fact that she was Jewish, and she in fact supported thus her own crisis, which eventually would make her flee Italy to Argentina and Uruguay for several years until it was safe for her to return. Whether or not she was just in complete denial or she really truly believed that there was a way to sleep with Mussolini and not be held accountable, I don&#x27;t know. But she ended up in an awkward position. She was hobnobbing with all these rich American people. I think in the context of the film, she&#x27;s somebody who has a job to do and because she loved art, she sometimes finds herself to be giving all this art away to people she feels don&#x27;t really appreciate it.

<doc id="592058" wikidata="Q3444692" url="?curid=592058" title="Outline of transgender topics">
<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to transgender topics.

The term &quot;transgender&quot; is multi-faceted and complex, especially where consensual and precise definitions have not yet been reached. While often the best way to find out how people identify themselves is to ask them, not all persons who might be thought of as falling under the transgender &#x27;umbrella&#x27; identify as such. &quot;Transgender&quot; can also be distinguished from &quot;intersex&quot;, a term for people born with physical sex characteristics &quot;that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies&quot;.

Books and articles written about transgender people or culture are often outdated by the time they are published, if not already outdated at the time of composition, due to inappropriate and/or outdated questions or premises. Psychology, medicine, and social sciences research, aid, or otherwise interact with or study transgender people. Each field starts from a different point of view, offers different perspectives, and uses different nomenclature. This difference is mirrored by the attitude of transgender people regarding transgender issues, which can be seen in the articles listed below.

<text>The Eads Bridge is a combined road and railway bridge over the Mississippi River connecting the cities of St. Louis, Missouri, and East St. Louis, Illinois. It is located on the St. Louis riverfront between Laclede&#x27;s Landing to the north, and the grounds of the Gateway Arch to the south. The bridge is named for its designer and builder, James Buchanan Eads. Work on the bridge began in 1867, and it was completed in 1874. The Eads Bridge was the first bridge across the Mississippi south of the Missouri River. Earlier bridges were located north of the Missouri, where the Mississippi is narrower. None of the earlier bridges survived, which means that the Eads Bridge is also the oldest bridge on the river.

To accommodate the massive size and strength of the Mississippi River, the Eads Bridge required a number of engineering feats. It pioneered the large-scale use of steel as a structural material, leading the shift from wrought-iron as the default material for large structures. Its foundations, more than 100 feet below water level, were the deepest underwater constructions at the time. They were installed using pneumatic caissons, a pioneering application of caisson technology in the United States and, at the time, by far the largest caissons ever built. Its 520-foot center arch was the longest rigid span ever built at the time. The arches were built suspended from temporary wooden towers, sometimes cited as the first use of the &quot;cantilever principle&quot; for a large bridge. These engineering principles were used for later bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge, which began construction in 1870.

The Eads Bridge became a famous image of the city of St. Louis, superseded only by the Gateway Arch, completed in 1965. The highway deck was closed to automobiles from 1991 to 2003, but has been restored and now carries both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. It connects Washington Avenue in St. Louis with Riverpark Drive and East Broadway in East St. Louis. The former railroad deck now carries the St. Louis MetroLink light rail system, connecting Missouri and Illinois stations.

The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark. As of April 2014, it carries about 8,100 vehicles daily, down 3,000 since the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge opened in February 2014.

==History==



The Eads Bridge was built by the Illinois and St. Louis Bridge Company. A subcontractor was the Keystone Bridge Company, founded in 1865 by Andrew Carnegie, which erected the steel superstructure.

The growth of railroads since the Civil War had depressed river shipping trade, and Chicago was fast gaining as the center of commerce in the West. The bridge was envisioned to restore St. Louis&#x27; eminence as a center of commerce by connecting railroad and vehicle transportation across the river. Although he had no experience in building bridges, James Eads was chosen as chief engineer.

In an attempt to secure their future, steamboat interests successfully lobbied to place restrictions on bridge construction, requiring spans and heights previously unheard of. This was ostensibly to maintain sufficient operating room for steamboats beneath the bridge&#x27;s base for the then foreseeable future. The unproclaimed purpose was to require a bridge so grand and lofty that it was impossible to erect according to conventional building techniques. The steamboat parties planned to prevent any structure from being built, in order to ensure continued dependence on river traffic to sustain commerce in the region.

Such a bridge required a radical design solution. The Mississippi River&#x27;s strong current was almost and the builders had to battle ice floes in the winter. The ribbed arch had been a known construction technique for centuries. The triple span, tubular metallic arch construction was supported by two shore abutments and two mid-river piers. Four pairs of arches per span (upper and lower) were set apart, supporting an upper deck for vehicular traffic and a lower deck for rail traffic.

Construction involved varied and confusing design elements and pressures. State and federal charters precluded suspension or draw bridges, or wood construction. There were constraints on span size and the height above the water line. The location required reconciling differences in heights - from the low Illinois floodplain of the east bank of the river to the high Missouri cliff on the west bank. The bedrock could only be reached by deep drilling, as it was below water level on the Illinois side and below on the Missouri side.

These pressures resulted in a bridge noted as innovative for precision and accuracy of construction and quality control. This was the first use of structural alloy steel in a major building construction, through use of cast chromium steel components – even though as 1988 tests showed, the amount of chromium was too low to influence the strength, and the steel in general wouldn&#x27;t be considered suitable for any structural application in modern times. The completed bridge also relied on significant—and unknown—amounts of wrought iron. Eads argued that the great compressive strength of steel was ideal for use in the upright arch design. His decision resulted from a curious combination of chance and necessity, due to the insufficient strength of alternative material choices.

The particular physical difficulties of the site stimulated interesting solutions to construction problems. The deep caissons used for pier and abutment construction signaled a new chapter in civil engineering. Piers were sunk almost below the river&#x27;s surface. Unable to construct falsework to erect the arches, because they would obstruct river traffic, Eads&#x27;s engineers devised a cantilevered rigging system to close the arches.

Masonry piers were built to heights of almost , about the height of a ten-story building. About of that span was driven through the sandy riverbed until it hit bedrock. Eads implemented a building method that he had observed in Europe, whereby masonry was set atop a metal chamber filled with compressed air. Stone was added to the chamber, which caused the caisson to sink. Workers dove into the caisson to shovel sand into a pump that shot it out into the air so the masonry could be sunk into the riverbed. Numerous workers who operated in the Eads Bridge caissons, still among the deepest ever sunk, suffered from &quot;caisson disease&quot; (also known as &quot;the bends&quot; or decompression sickness). Fifteen workers died, two other workers were permanently disabled, and 77 were severely afflicted.

The Eads Bridge was recognized as an innovative and exciting achievement. Eads secured 47 patents during his lifetime, many of which were taken out for parts of the bridge&#x27;s structure and devices for its construction. President Ulysses S. Grant dedicated the bridge on July 4, 1874, and General William T. Sherman drove the gold spike completing construction. After completion, 14 locomotives crossed the bridge to prove its stability.

On June 14, 1874, John Robinson led a &quot;test elephant&quot; on a stroll across the new Eads Bridge to prove that it was safe. A big crowd cheered as the elephant from a traveling circus lumbered toward Illinois. Popular belief held that elephants had instincts that would make them avoid setting foot on unsafe structures. Two weeks later, Eads sent 14 locomotives back and forth across the bridge at one time. The opening day celebration on July 4, 1874, featured a parade that stretched for through the streets of St. Louis.

The cost of building the bridge was nearly $10 million ($ million with inflation).

The Eads Bridge was undercapitalized during construction and burdened with debt. Because of its historic focus on the Mississippi and river trade, St. Louis lacked adequate rail terminal facilities, and the bridge was poorly planned to coordinate rail access. Although an engineering and aesthetic success, the bridge operations became bankrupt within a year of opening. The railroads boycotted the bridge, resulting in a loss of tolls. The bridge was later sold at auction for 20 cents on the dollar. This sale caused the National Bank of the State of Missouri to fold, which was the largest bank failure in the United States at that time. Eads did not suffer financial consequences. Many involved with financing the bridge were indicted, but Eads was not.

Granite for the bridge came from the Iron County, Missouri, quarry of B. Gratz Brown, Missouri Governor and U.S. Senator, who had helped secure federal financing for the bridge.

In April 1875, after the failure of the Illinois and St Louis Bridge Company, the bridge was sold at public auction, for $2 million, to a newly incorporated St. Louis Bridge Company controlled by the old company&#x27;s creditors. This group was bought-out two years later by the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis (TRRA). The TRRA owned the bridge until 1989, when the Terminal Railroad transferred the bridge to the Bi-State Regional Transportation Authority and the City of St. Louis, for incorporation into St Louis&#x27; MetroLink light rail system. In exchange for Eads Bridge, the TRRA acquired the MacArthur Bridge, previously owned by the City of St Louis.

In 1949, the bridge&#x27;s strength was tested with electromagnetic strain gauges. It was determined that Eads&#x27; original estimation of an allowable load of could be raised to . According to Carol Ferring Shepley, a professional writer who has written a biography of the bridge&#x27;s designer, Eads Bridge is still considered one of the greatest bridges ever built.

The Eads Bridge had long hosted only passenger trains on its rail deck. In the late 20th century, however, passenger traffic had declined because of individual automobile use, and the railroad industry was restructuring. By the 1970s, the Terminal Railroad Association had abandoned its Eads trackage. The bridge had lost all remaining passenger rail traffic to the MacArthur Bridge during the early years of Amtrak; the dimensions of modern passenger diesels were incompatible with both the bridge and the adjoining tunnel linking the Union Station trackage with Eads.

MetroLink service over the bridge began in 1993. The bridge was closed to automobile traffic between 1991 and 2003, when the city of St. Louis, Missouri, completed a project to restore the highway deck.

In 1998, the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center investigated the effects of the ramming of the bridge by the towboat &quot;Anne Holly&quot; on April 4 of that year. The ramming resulted in the near breakaway of the SS &quot;Admiral&quot;, a riverboat casino. Implementing several recommended changes reduced the odds of this happening in the future.

In 2012, the Bi-State Development Agency/Metro (BSDA/Metro) started the Eads Bridge Rehabilitation project to extend the life of the bridge to at least the year 2091. The restorations included replacing 1.2 million pounds of struts, bracing, and other support steel dating to the 1880s; removing all paint and corrosion from the superstructure; re-painting the superstructure with a rust-inhibiting coating; repairing damaged structure; rebuilding concrete supports; restoring the brick archways; and upgrading the MetroLink&#x27;s rails. The total cost was $48 million, with $27 million coming from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. While expected to start in 2009, work did not begin until 2012 due to labor disputes and higher-than-expected cost estimates. Workers completed the project in 2016.

== Tunnel ==
City fathers wanted a wagon bridge to the heart of town to highlight the best features of St. Louis. Economics required that it be a railroad bridge, but there was no space for railroads in the heart of downtown. Hence, a tunnel was authorized to connect the bridge to the Missouri Pacific Railroad to the south (and later to the new Union Station).

Eads worked out the specifications for the tunnel. It was to be a “cut and cover” tunnel 4000 ft long, 30 ft below street level. They advertised for bids in the Missouri Republican on August 31, 1872. The contract was awarded to William Skrainka and Company. Construction began in October. A series of problems arose including quicksand and springs on the planned route. Also several workers were injured; at least one was killed.

On November 29, the city council passed an ordinance changing the tunnel route to Eight Street and transferring the right to build to the newly formed St. Louis Tunnel Railroad Company.

In April, Skrainka and Co. decided the project was too difficult. They agreed to complete construction south of Market St. The work north of Market was assigned to James Andrews, the stonemason overseeing construction of the bridge piers.

The Eads Bridge was ready to be opened after seven years of construction on July 4, 1874. The celebration included a fifteen-car train filled with 500 dignitaries pulled by three locomotives that departed from the St. Louis, Vandalia, and Terre Haute Railroad station in East St. Louis. Locomotives were provided by the Illinois Central Railroad and the Vandalia line (a Pennsylvania Railroad subsidiary). The route crossed the Eads Bridge and traveled through the tunnel to Mill Creek Valley and then returned.

Locomotive smoke is a concern in tunnels, especially passenger tunnels. Specially designed coke-burning “smoke-consuming engines” from the Baldwin Locomotive Works had yet to be ordered. News reports tell of passengers coughing and gasping for breath. Construction of the tunnel was not yet complete. Only one of the two tracks was available and ventilation was not yet arranged.

A photograph of the St. Louis Bridge Company&#x27;s coke-burning engine appears on page 38 of Brown&#x27;s Baldwin Locomotive Works.

The St. Louis Bridge Company almost certainly had a transfer station in East St. Louis to switch trains entering St. Louis from Illinois between steam locomotives and the coke-burning engine used in this tunnel, as the Eads Bridge&#x27;s railroad deck connects directly to the tunnel. This would have been analogous to the later (1910–1937), well-known Manhattan Transfer station in New Jersey, except there rail passengers switched between the electric trains used in the New York Tunnel Extension tunnels under the Hudson River (North River Tunnels) and thru New York City (historic Penn Station and East River Tunnels) and the steam trains then used on the Pennsylvania Railroad main line (now part of Amtrak’s electrified Northeast Corridor along with the tunnels and present-day Penn Station), instead of switching engines on the train itself as was apparently the case in St. Louis.

In 1875, the bridge and tunnel companies declared bankruptcy. In 1881, Jay Gould got control of the bridge and tunnel companies by threatening to build a competing bridge four miles north of St. Louis. In 1889, Gould was instrumental in the creation of the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis. He died in 1892, but this led to the construction of Union Station in 1894.

The Eads Bridge and its tunnel are now used by Metrolink, the St. Louis light rail system.

==Recognition==
At the 1893 Columbian Exposition, Missouri exhibited a model of the bridge made of sugar cane.

In 1898 the bridge was featured on the $2 Trans-Mississippi Issue of postage stamps. One hundred years later the design was reprinted in a commemorative souvenir sheet.

The bridge was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1964, in recognition of its innovations in design, materials, and construction methods, and its importance in the history of large-scale engineering projects.

During the bridge&#x27;s construction, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;The World&#x27;s Eighth Wonder&quot;. On its 100th anniversary, the Times&#x27; architectural critic, Ada Louise Huxtable, described it as &quot;among the most beautiful works of man.&quot;

<doc id="592065" wikidata="Q1190997" url="?curid=592065" title="Riau Archipelago">
<text>The Riau Archipelago is a &quot;geographic&quot; term (as opposed to administrative region) for the core group of islands within the Riau Islands Province in Indonesia, and located south of Singapore and east of Riau on Sumatra. Before the province of Riau Islands was formed, there was no ambiguity in term; however, in Indonesian language, both the archipelago and administrative province are referred to simply as &quot;Kepulauan Riau&quot;. The province may have the word &quot;Provinsi&quot; preceding it for clarity. Additionally, the term BBK for &quot;Batam Bintan Karimun&quot; may refer to the archipelago.

==History==

The name of this archipelago predates the creation of the Indonesian province, and historically did not include the Lingga Islands or Natuna Islands, which now belong to that province. On the other hand, Singapore was considered a part of the islands, at least in the Islamic eras.

===Srivijaya and Jambi===
From 650 CE–1377 CE are accepted dates for the Srivijaya empire, when the area seemed to be well within the bounds of their control.
The Jambi Kingdom sacked the Srivijaya capital in 1088, allowing that empire to grow and spread Malay (language) as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;, ostensibly as a successor or part of the Srivijaya empire itself.
The Pamalayu expedition force of the Singhasari empire in 1275 sacked the Jambi/Srivijaya forces. Bintan was a staging ground in the Malay Annals for the foundation of a state at Temasek (Singapore).

===Singapura Era===
The Kingdom of Singapura dated from 1299 to 1398 but it not known how much influence it wielded on the nearby Riau archipelago.

===Islamic Era===
When exactly control passed to the Malacca Sultanate is unknown, but that sultanate dates from 1400 until 1511, when the Portuguese conquered and sacked Malacca (Melaka). Some time after, the Johor Sultanate, once itself part of the Malacca Sultanate, took control of the area until Sultan Mahmud III&#x27;s death in 1811, and Singapore&#x27;s purchase in 1819, the islands of the Riau Archipelago, along with Temasek (now Singapore). The islands then became part of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, created after the succession dispute following the death of Mahmud III of Johor, when Abdul Rahman was crowned as the first Sultan of Riau-Lingga in 1812.

===Colonial Era===
The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 established the border between Dutch and British interests and awarded the islands to the Dutch sector of influence. Henceforth, Singapore was no longer co-administered. The remaining archipelago became a part of the Residency of Riau and Dependencies (Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden Riouw).

===Modern===
* In 1989, the Sijori Growth Triangle was formed to speed up development, especially in Batam.
* In 2002, Riau Islands Province was carved out of Riau Province.
* In 2009, the area was formally included in a free-trade zone, though it had already been operating as such.

==Social change==
A number of studies and books have detailed the growing violence and concern about identity and social change in the archipelago. As the Malay, who were once the dominant ethnic group in the islands, have been reduced to about a third of the population, primarily as a result of immigration from elsewhere in Indonesia, they feel that their traditional rights are threatened. Similarly, the immigrants have felt politically and financially suppressed. Both of these causes have led to increased violence.

Piracy in the archipelago is also an issue.

==Islands==
The main islands are Batam, Rempang, Galang, Bintan, Combol, Kundur, and Karimun.

Tanjung Pinang located in the south of Bintan Island is the provincial capital. Tanjung Balai Karimun is an international port along with Tanjung Pinang.

==Transport==
High speed ferry services exist to the archipelago of the south, the Lingga Islands (Kepulauan Lingga).

<text>The Dread Pirate Roberts is the identity assumed by several characters in the novel &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1973) and its 1987 film adaptation. Various pirates (including Westley) take on the role of Roberts and use his reputation to intimidate their opponents, before retiring and secretly passing on the name to someone else.

==Role in &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;==
A pirate of near-mythical reputation, the Dread Pirate Roberts is feared across the seven seas for his ruthlessness and sword fighting prowess, and is well known for taking no prisoners.

It is revealed during the course of the story that Roberts is not one man; rather, it is a series of individuals who pass the Roberts name and reputation to a chosen successor once they are wealthy enough to retire. When the time comes, the current &quot;Roberts&quot; and his chosen successor sail into port and discharge the crew. They then hire a new crew, the ex-Roberts staying aboard as first mate and referring to his successor as &quot;Captain Roberts&quot;. Once the crew grows accustomed to the new Roberts, the previous captain leaves to enjoy his retirement.

Westley, the hero of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, was on a voyage to seek his fortune when his ship was captured by the Dread Pirate (who never leaves captives alive) and Westley is reported dead. While the other passengers are weeping and offering bribery for their lives, Westley simply asks Roberts to please not kill him. The &quot;please&quot; arousing his interest, Roberts asks, &quot;Why should I make an exception of Westley then explains his mission to get enough money to reunite with his true love, Buttercup. Westley&#x27;s description of Buttercup&#x27;s beauty moves Roberts to the point that he hires Westley as a personal attendant. While Roberts is impressed with Westley&#x27;s work, he continues to keep Westley&#x27;s future in doubt by saying each night, &quot;Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I&#x27;ll most likely kill you in the morning.&quot; After about three years, Roberts and Westley have grown close, and Roberts promotes Westley to his second-in-command. Shortly after that, Roberts reveals to Westley that the guise of the &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; is merely a pseudonym that he has inherited, and that his real name is Ryan. Roberts goes on to explain that the method works because Roberts&#x27; notorious reputation inspires overwhelming fear in sailors. Ships immediately capitulate and surrender their wealth rather than be taken by force, a fate they imagine to be certain death. A pirate operating under his own name is said to be incapable of such infamy: &quot;No one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley.&quot;

The fear inspired by the title is used in Westley&#x27;s plan of invading the castle right before Buttercup&#x27;s wedding. In the invasion the giant Fezzik poses as Roberts to inspire fear in the castle guard. The fear is amplified by Fezzik&#x27;s size and a few more tricks, and makes the entire guard run away so that the invaders can easily enter.

===Retirement===
In both the movie and the novel, Westley indicates that he plans to retire after reuniting with Buttercup. In the movie, he suggests that Inigo Montoya might succeed him. However, in the novel, no mention is made as to who is to succeed Westley as the Dread Pirate Roberts. In the first chapter of &quot;Buttercup&#x27;s Baby&quot; (the supposed sequel to the novel), which is included in the 25th anniversary edition of the book, Goldman refers to &#x27;Pierre&#x27;, who is in charge of the pirate ship &quot;Revenge&quot; during Westley&#x27;s absence and next in line to become the Dread Pirate Roberts. By the end of the chapter, Westley and his companions leave the ship again, presumably leaving Pierre once again in charge, but no mention is made of an official transfer of the title of Dread Pirate Roberts.

===Holders of the title===
Holders of the title &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot; include:

# The original Roberts, retired 15 years in Patagonia at the time Ryan picked Westley to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts
# Clooney, the original Roberts&#x27; first mate (only in the novel)
# Cummerbund
# Ryan
# Westley, who presumably retired shortly following the end of the novel
# Inigo Montoya, who presumably inherited the title from Westley (movie version)
# Pierre, who was in line to assume the title after Westley (novel version)

In the film&#x27;s continuity, neither Clooney nor Pierre are mentioned, and Westley does not state how many (if any) individuals held the title between the original Roberts and Cummerbund.

==Other uses of the name==
Ross Ulbricht, operator of the illicit goods marketplace Silk Road, used the alias &quot;Dread Pirate Roberts&quot;. In a display of life imitating art, another person claimed the name Dread Pirate Roberts, reopening the Silk Road website one month after the original site was seized by US law enforcement.

The name was also used by John Hiatt in his song, &quot;Only the Song Survives&quot;, from the album &quot;Crossing Muddy Waters&quot;.&lt;br&gt;

<text>Akçakoca is a town in Düzce Province, in the West Black Sea Region of Turkey, located about 200 km east of Istanbul. It is the seat of Akçakoca District. Its population is 27,878 (2022). The town was named after a Turkish chieftain of the 14th century CE who captured the area for the Ottoman Empire, and sports a statue in his honor. The town features a modern mosque of unusual design. Tourist attractions include beaches and a small ruined Genoese castle. It is the regional center of hazelnut cultivation.

== Name ==
In the classical period the town &quot;Dia&quot; or &quot;Diospolis&quot; was located at the site of present Akçakoca. After the Turkish conquest, the town was named &quot;Akçaşehir&quot;, which was changed to Akçakoca in 1934.

== Population ==
Akçakoca&#x27;s estimated population of about 30,000 increases during the summer months, due to tourism activities and cottage owners. Due to war, specifically the one between the Ottomans and Russia in 1877–1878, a wide range of people, most of whom had roots in the Pontic region (Lazes, Georgians, and Abkhazians), emigrated from their native lands to settle in Akçakoca.

== History ==
=== Latin-Nicea Empires Period and Genoese ===
During the Fourth Crusade, European armies conquered Constantinople in 1204, founding the Latin Empire for a short period. Because of this situation, the Genoese established commercial bases on the Western Black Sea coasts for their interests, which included a Genoese castle in Akçakoca. This castle helped to protect trade routes in the area and was used for commercial activities itself. When the Nicea Empire reconquered Constaninople in 1261, Akçakoca, which was under the auspices of the Nicea Empire, came under Byzantine rule again.

Turkic people seem to have been living in Akçakoca since 1243, after Mongol pressure and defeat. From Kastamonu, the Oghuz tribes of Kınık and Üçok migrated westward, some of them came to Akçakoca and settled. The Oghuz Turks then plundered Genoese trade centers and Greek villages, upon which the Genoese and Greeks complained to the Byzantine Emperor, who responded to the complaints and brought and settled Christian Cumans, Pechenegs, Uzes from Romania Dobruja to protect the region against the Turkmens. Oguz from the Kayı tribe settled here.

=== The Seljuks and Ottoman ===
Before the crusades, The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum controlled the region around Akçakoca.

There is no evidence that a military action was taken by the Ottomans to conquer Akçakoca from the Byzantines. According to some historians, the Turk population submitted to Ottoman rule without military action.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Akçakoca was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.

=== Republic ===
After the foundation of Turkish Republic, it was renamed Akçakoca. The first governor was Ali Zarifi (Okay). Due to the 1999 Düzce and Marmara earthquakes, Düzce had been declared a province by the government, and the town was included in the new province as a district.

==Climate==
Akçakoca has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;).

== Economy ==

=== Tourism ===
After the 1950s, touristic activities in summer seasons attained an important place in Akçakoca&#x27;s economy. The construction of tourism facilities and new transportation improvements further influenced tourism in the late-1970&#x27;s.

==== Water sports ====
Numerous water sports such as sailing, swimming, water skiing, sunbathing, fishing, scuba diving, are performed in Akçakoca. Sailing and diving have become more prominent in the last few years. In 2010, sailing races have been held as part of the 14th Akçakoca Festival. Furthermore, the first Marine and Sailing Club in the town was opened in town in 2012.

=== Heavy industry ===
Akçakoca has one large factory, which produces large pipes for a variety of purposes. It has great importance both Akçakoca and Ereğli. Akçakoca also has only natural gas platform over the Black Sea. There are four platforms which three of them are small and one is big.

=== Fishing ===
Fishing is traditional job in Akçakoca. Anchovies, nonita, bluefish, whiting, red mullet, clams, jack mackerel, sea bass, salmon, trout, and turbot are some of fish that can be found.

=== Government ===
One governor&#x27;s office and one municipality building can be found in Akçakoca. It has one state hospital, one rest home and a small tourism office for tourists.

=== Construction ===
There is an attractive mosque what built in 2004. Akçakoca Central Mosque was built in a similar fashion to Faisal Mosque in Pakistan. The mosque was designed by Ergün Subaşı. This highly irregular mosque was placed above 160 concrete poles driven into the ground. The dome height is 31 meters and covered by 32 tons of copper plates. And the chandelier that resembles the dome in reverse weigh around 1300 kg. The rocket like minarets are at 58 meters in height.

== Culture ==

=== Festivals ===
There is a traditional festival every July. During the festival, scheduled buses from neighbor towns and cities, such as Ereğli, Düzce, Zonguldak, Bolu and Adapazarı carrypeople to Akçakoca.

=== Languages ===
Some native languages are nearly forgotten, but there are some towns and people who speak Georgian, Laz and Circassian. Native Turk people of Akçakoca are Manav Turks.

=== Dances and Music ===
Because of the presence of many residents originally from the eastern Black Sea littoral, &#x27;Horon&#x27;, played with the Pontic lyra/kemençe are popular here.

== Damage to Historical and Natural Heritage ==
Tourism activities in Akçakoca rely on short summer tourism, also depending on beach tourism, also referred to as sea-sand-sun tourism. Prior to 1945, Akçakoca had a wider and longer coastline. The beach extended from Cuhallı to the rocks on the western side (today there is a five-star hotel called Skytower) and continued until the castle beach below Geonavise Castle. However, road construction, cafes, restaurants, hotels, and residential buildings have made the beach narrower and shorter on the Cuhallı side. In the center of Akçakoca, there used to be a large and beautiful beach, which was part of Cuhallı Beach, but now there is a harbor for fishermen. Many locals attribute the construction of the harbor, formed by piling concrete and rocks, to the discomfort felt by conservative elements towards people swimming and walking in swimsuits and shorts.

In Akçakoca, there are many wooden houses in neighborhoods such as Yukarı Mahalle, Cumhuriyet Mahallesi, and Orhangazi. The government has declared these areas as protected sites. As a result, no one can claim ownership of these houses, not even their owners can intervene for repairs and use. Most of these houses are collapsing, and some are damaged by fire because it is illegal to make any changes in the area. However, the government has yet to take action regarding these houses and areas. Consequently, they are quietly awaiting their fate.

<text>Blazin&#x27; Squad were an English hip hop group. The group had six top ten hits, including &quot;Crossroads&quot;, a cover version of the Bone Thugs-n-Harmony original.

==Career==

===&quot;In The Beginning&quot;: 2002===
The band released a number of white label singles on the Weighty Plates label featuring remixes of the track &quot;Standard Flow&quot; from their album &quot;In the Beginning&quot;. &quot;Standard Flow&quot; was remixed by Ras Kwarme and Origin Unknown, with a version available featuring Jamaican dancehall musician Elephant Man on guest vocals. Even though the releases were issued as underground white labels, &quot;Standard Flow&quot; sold enough copies to chart as Blazin&#x27; Squad&#x27;s first Top 100 chart entry, peaking at number 78 on the chart of 17 August 2002 with three weeks in the countdown.
For their official debut, the band released a cover of the Bone Thugs-N-Harmony song &quot;Crossroads&quot; for Warner Music&#x27;s East West Records label. This single was the first to reach the UK Top 40, and debuted in the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart of 31 August 2002. The song was highly re-recorded and hardly contained any lyrics of the original. The single was heavily criticised by the media, some of whom claimed their rap skills were &#x27;not to be taken seriously&#x27;, and others sidelining them to a younger audience. Despite this, however, their debut album, &quot;In the Beginning&quot; achieved gold status in the UK and spawned two further top ten hits, &quot;Love on the Line&quot; and double A-side single, &quot;Reminisce/Where the Story Ends&quot;. The album was released to general critical censure. Jon O&#x27;Brien of AllMusic called them the &quot;self-proclaimed pioneers of &#x27;chav&#x27; culture&quot;.

===&quot;Now or Never&quot;: 2003–2004===

The group went on to achieve further chart success in 2003, with two further top five chart hits. &quot;We Just Be Dreamin&#x27;&quot; reached number three in July 2003, and &quot;Flip Reverse&quot;, which was co-written by former member Liam D&#x27;Souza reached number two in November. &quot;Flip Reverse&quot; was subsequently used to re-launch &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, with a special performance recorded outside the BBC Television Centre with 100 or so hooded back-up dancers. Despite the chart success of their singles, the group failed to match their success with their second album, &quot;Now or Never&quot;, only peaking at #36 on the UK Albums Chart. A live recording of a concert in Liverpool was released on DVD for Christmas 2003 but failed to achieve any commercial success. It also failed to re-ignite the low sales of the album. &quot;Here 4 One&quot; was issued as the third single from &quot;Now or Never&quot; in early 2004, peaking at #6 on the UK Singles Chart, but sales failed to be strong enough to warrant a third album deal.

===Friday Hill and &quot;Times Like These&quot;: 2005–2006===
In 2005, Strider, Flava and Kenzie signed a record deal with Polydor records, and began recording an album under the name Friday Hill, named after a location in their hometown in Chingford. In October 2005, the group released their debut single, &quot;Baby Goodbye&quot;, which reached #5 in the UK Singles Chart, selling over 80,000 copies. In February 2006, they released a second single, &quot;One More Night Alone&quot;, which reached #13 on the UK Singles Chart. Their album, entitled &quot;Times Like These&quot;, was also released in February 2006, but only peaked at #67 on the UK Albums Chart, leading them to be dropped from their label. 

In July 2006, Rocky-B, Reepa, Spike-E and Melo-D made an announcement that they were going to reform as Blazin&#x27; Squad, and record and release a new album under Peach Records. They released a single, &quot;All Night Long&quot;, in August 2006, however, it only peaked at #54, which resulted in their record deal being scrapped and their disbandment.

===&quot;Greatest Hits&quot;: 2009===
In June 2009, Strider, Flava, Kenzie, Krazy and Rocky B announced they would be re-uniting as a five piece, and subsequently released their comeback single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Start Again&quot;. The single fared slightly better than the previous single but could only peak at #51 on the UK Singles Chart. Despite their record label wanting to drop them following the lack of success of the single, they had signed a binding contract to release an album. The label issued a Greatest Hits compilation via digital download and thereby ended the contract with the group.

<text>Young Italy (, ) was an Italian political movement founded in 1831 by Giuseppe Mazzini. A few months after leaving Italy, in June 1831, Mazzini wrote a letter to King Charles Albert of Sardinia, in which he asked him to unite Italy and lead the nation. A month later, convinced that his demands did not reach the king, he founded the movement in Marseille. It would then spread out to other nations across Europe. The movement&#x27;s goal was to create a united Italian republic through promoting a general insurrection in the Italian reactionary states and in the lands occupied by the Austrian Empire. Mazzini&#x27;s belief was that a popular uprising would create a unified Italy. The slogan that defined the movement&#x27;s aim was &quot;Union, Strength, and Liberty&quot;. The phrase could be found in the tricolor Italian flag, which represented the country&#x27;s unity.

==Overview==
The &quot;Giovine Italia&quot; was founded in France, in July 1831 when Mazzini was in exile. Its members adopted nicknames taken from figures of the Italian Middle Ages. Every member of the brotherhood had to recite an Oath, where they would pledge to make Italy a united, free, independent, republican nation, and where every man would be considered equal. The movement garnered about 60,000 members around 1833. In that same year, many of the members who were plotting a revolt in Savoy and Piedmont were arrested and executed by the Sardinian police. In Austria, having links with the movement was seen as treason. The crime was punishable by death.

After another failed Mazzinian revolt in Piedmont and Savoy of the February 1834, the movement disappeared for some time, reappearing in 1838 in England. Further insurrections in Sicily, Abruzzi, Tuscany, Lombardy-Venetia, Romagna (1841 and 1845), and Bologna (1843) failed. Also short-lived was the Roman Republic of 1848–49, which was crushed by a French Army called in to help by Pope Pius IX. That Pope was initially hailed by Mazzini as the most likely paladin of a liberal unification of Italy, but he turned into the leader of the reactionaries.

Similar movements were set up around Europe by Mazzini himself. &quot;La Giovine Italia&quot; became affiliated with the movement Giovine Europa (created in 1835), an internationally oriented association, together with similar movements such as &quot;Junges Deutschland&quot;, &quot;Młoda Polska&quot;, &quot;Young Turks&quot; and &quot;Giovine Svizzera&quot;. It also inspired &quot;Mlada Bosna&quot;, early-20th-century Serbian revolutionary movement in occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Mazzini&#x27;s movement was basically evicted after a last failed revolt against Austria in Milan in 1853, crushing hopes of a democratic Italy in favor of the Piedmontese monarchy. It achieved national unification in 1860 under the leadership of Count Cavour.

The most famous member of Young Italy was Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807–1882). He joined the movement around 1833, after meeting Mazzini through social and political reforms back in Geneva. Additionally, he was part of a failed revolt led by Mazzini in Piedmont. As a consequence, he was sentenced to death. After learning his fate, Garibaldi fled to Marseille.

Later on, similar nationalist movements for youth appeared in Europe&#x27;s colonies in various Asian and African countries from the mid 19th century to the period of decolonization in the late 20th century.

<text>Captain Star is a 1997 animated television series created by Steven Appleby and is based on Appleby&#x27;s comic &quot;Rockets Passing Overhead&quot;. It stars Richard E. Grant as the voice of Captain Jim Star. The show was produced by Cosgrove Hall Films and HTV.

13 half-hour episodes were produced and aired from 1997 to 1998.

==Plot==
The narrative of Captain Star revolves around the crew of a rocket ship named The Boiling Hell. They receive orders to travel to a dry planet known as &quot;The Nameless Planet&quot; at the Ragged Edge of the Universe, where they are to await their next assignment. The ship&#x27;s crew comprises the deeply egocentric and often paranoid Captain Star, the Science Officer Scarlett, the nine-headed, six-armed mutant Engineer/Stoker &quot;Limbs&quot; Jones, and the fish-keeping milquetoast Navigator Black. Later on, they are joined by a robot named Jim-Bob-Bob, tasked with laundry duties and various other acts of menial servitude.

Captain Star is heralded in the opening theme song as &quot;the greatest hero any world has ever known.&quot; A legendary explorer with hundreds of planets named after him, Captain Star&#x27;s birthday is celebrated as a holiday throughout the entire universe. Despite his renowned status, the characters in the program find themselves continuously awaiting further orders from Mission Control, which never materialize. Stranded on The Nameless Planet for an extended period, Navigator Black even constructs a fish restaurant during their wait. It remains unclear whether Mission Control has simply forgotten about Captain Star and his crew, but there is an implication that they have spared him the indignity of forced retirement, allowing him to maintain his hero status in the public eye. Throughout the series, events both on and off the planet frequently necessitate Captain Star&#x27;s intervention.

==Main characters==

Captain Jim Star (voiced by Richard E. Grant) — Groomed from birth to be a starship captain, Captain Star is regarded as the greatest captain in the fleet. Leaving the Captains&#x27; Academy at the age of 12, Captain Star embarked on a year-long apprenticeship under Captain Ned Nova of the Merry Cheeser. Notably, Captain Nova had named 115 planets after himself, a record eventually surpassed by Captain Star. At present, Captain Star is approximately 127 &quot;space years&quot; old, equating to a man in his 50s in his society. Possessing confidence that borders on arrogance, Captain Star views himself as a hero and deems himself worthy of the widespread acclaim he receives. Despite his lack of humility, he remains unquestionably loyal and firmly believes that his awaited orders will eventually arrive, often disregarding both danger and the advice or concerns of his crew.

First Officer Scarlett (voiced by Denica Fairman) — A strong, brave, redheaded woman, and an accomplished scientist, Scarlett often saves the day through her scientific endeavours. Scarlett&#x27;s logic and investigative mood are a stark contrast to Captain Star&#x27;s tendency to improvise in an emergency. On The Nameless Planet, where Captain Star has no ship to command or adventures to lead, Scarlett handles most of his command duties.

Atomic Engine Stoker &quot;Limbs&quot; Jones (voiced by Adrian Edmondson) — Mutated in an atomic accident, &quot;Limbs&quot; Jones has nine heads and six arms. Each of Jones&#x27; heads accommodates a different part of his brain, causing each head to have a slightly different personality. Jones is a cat lover, having sequentially named pet cats Sputnik 1 through 374. Conversations between Jones&#x27; many heads and other members of the crew often lead them to become impatient and annoyed with him.

Navigator Black (voiced by Kerry Shale/Gary Martin) — Once the navigator of the &quot;Boiling Hell&quot;, Navigator Black sets up a small fish-shaped restaurant on The Nameless Planet and becomes the cook. Obsessed with fish, the restaurant is filled with aquariums. Black often swims with his fish, and even creates a brain-computer interface device that depicts their thoughts. Black has a nervous temperament and often panics under pressure. A running gag in the show is Navigator Black&#x27;s inability to tell his left from his right.

==Story format and themes==
Some episodes of Captain Star commence with a flashback to The Boiling Hell&#x27;s magnificent missions, promptly contrasted with their present state of abandonment on The Nameless Planet as a crew past its prime. These flashbacks serve to set the episode&#x27;s tone and offer a foreshadowing of the thematic elements in the story. Concluding each episode, Captain Star, seated in his wheelbarrow, recounts an entry in his Captain&#x27;s Diary that typically begins with &quot;Uneventful day.&quot; This is followed by a brief witticism encapsulating the moral of the story.

The Low-Flying Moon, a small moon in an extremely close orbit around The Nameless Planet, frequently passes overhead, causing objects on the ground to briefly levitate for a few seconds.

For a children&#x27;s television program, Captain Star deals with unusually advanced themes. The primary theme throughout the series is of society&#x27;s treatment of the aged. While Captain Star appears to be strong and healthy and continues to save the universe, after several years of distinguished service, Mission Control sweeps him under the rug by sending him to the edge of the universe to an unnamed planet and has him remain there without any orders to carry out. Despite continuing to prove his usefulness, there is an ageist undertone that Mission Control assumes that he is no longer a valuable asset because of his age and extensive service.

Many episodes feature a popular TV show titled &quot;Star of Space&quot; in which actors portray the crew of the &quot;Boiling Hell&quot; in many of Captain Star&#x27;s most heroic missions. Captain Star is presented as a James Bond-like hero, handsome and virile, who saves the day almost effortlessly. The episodes exaggerate his role in events while minimizing the contributions of his crew — most conspicuously presenting strong and scientifically accomplished first officer Scarlett as a bimbo and damsel in distress. Even when watching events that had just occurred earlier in the episode, the entire crew, except for Scarlett, regard the re-enactments as mostly historically accurate, emphasizing the role of television as a means to control public perception of people and events.

Despite Captain Star being out of the public eye, he continues to be showcased as a hero through public propaganda. By maintaining his active duty status and strategically placing him at the Ragged Edge of the Universe, the public perception keeps him as a timeless hero, forever in his prime. His birthday is celebrated as a public holiday throughout the universe, providing an opportunity to portray him as a larger-than-life figure and promote him as a role model. While not overtly dystopian, there is an implication that the government exploits Captain Star&#x27;s fame, possibly as a recruitment tool and to foster patriotism, unity, and support for the government.

115 space years prior to the events of the program, Captain Star&#x27;s former captain, Ned Nova, was ordered into retirement. Ignoring orders, Nova fled in his ship, the &quot;Merry Cheeser&quot;. Captain Star was ordered to arrest his former captain and chased the &quot;Merry Cheeser&quot; to a black hole. Refusing to retire, Nova piloted his ship into the black hole. He was discovered in the present day in suspended animation in the stomach of a space slug on The Nameless Planet. Star decided to let him leave in his rocket ship and declared that he could never have been Ned Nova because he was only half Ned Nova&#x27;s age (thanks to his preservation inside the space slug). While an act of loyalty to his former captain and role model, his willingness to preserve an idealized image of Nova by refusing to arrest him and turn him over to Mission Control in disgrace ironically mirrors Mission Control&#x27;s decision to preserve an idealized image of Star himself by exiling him on The Nameless Planet.

The program frequently satirizes commercialism in an exaggerated manner. The opening theme discloses that Captain Star&#x27;s renowned heroics involved renaming inhabited planets after himself, akin to explorers during the colonial era renaming and claiming lands for Europe. He would then proceed to sell unnecessary items to the inhabitants, like a group of aliens purchasing umbrellas before returning to their underwater homes. In the second episode, a persistent &quot;hard sell droid&quot; attempts to peddle a carpet to the crew, refusing to accept &quot;no&quot; for an answer. Ultimately, the crew is compelled to dismantle the droid, revealing its brain to be the size of a pea. Numerous episodes showcase improbable Captain Star-themed products and memorabilia, such as a croquet set featuring a tee and hoops shaped like Captain Star&#x27;s head, highlighting the pervasive consumerism surrounding Star&#x27;s identity and likeness.

<text>William Henry Pickering (February 15, 1858 – January 16, 1938) was an American astronomer. Pickering constructed and established several observatories or astronomical observation stations, notably including Percival Lowell&#x27;s Flagstaff Observatory. He led solar eclipse expeditions and studied craters on the Moon, and hypothesized that changes in the appearance of the crater Eratosthenes were due to &quot;lunar insects&quot;. He spent much of the later part of his life at his private observatory in Jamaica.

==Biography==
William Pickering was born on February 15, 1858, in Boston, Massachusetts. His older brother was Edward Charles Pickering, director of the Harvard College Observatory for three decades.

He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1879 then became an instructor in physics from 1880 to 1887.

Throughout his life Pickering was known as an avid hiker and mountaineer. He was also a charter member of the Appalachian Mountain Club, founded in 1876. In 1882 he published &quot;Walking Guide to the Mt. Washington Range&quot;, arguably the first modern hiking trail guide to be published in America. The book contained a topographical trail map, which is also likely to be the first published trail map of the White Mountains.

In 1883 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences at the age of 25.

He discovered Saturn&#x27;s ninth moon Phoebe in 1899 from plates taken in 1898. He produced a photographic atlas of the Moon: &quot;The Moon : A Summary of the Existing Knowledge of our Satellite&quot; in 1903.

He believed he discovered a tenth Saturnian moon in 1905 from plates taken in 1904, which he called &quot;Themis&quot;. For this discovery he was awarded the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1905. &quot;Themis&quot; was later shown not to exist.

Following George Darwin, he speculated in 1907 that the Moon was once a part of the Earth and that it broke away where now the Pacific Ocean lies. He also proposed a version of continental drift before Alfred Wegener where America, Asia, Africa, and Europe once formed a single continent, which broke up because of the separation of the Moon.

In 1908, he made a statement regarding the possibility of airplanes that had not yet been invented, saying that &quot;a popular fantasy is to suppose that flying machines could be used to drop dynamite on the enemy in time of war&quot;.

In 1919, he predicted the existence and position of a Planet X based on anomalies in the positions of Uranus and Neptune but a search of Mount Wilson Observatory photographs failed to find the predicted planet. Pluto was later discovered at Flagstaff by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, but in any case it is now known that Pluto&#x27;s mass is far too small to have appreciable gravitational effects on Uranus or Neptune, and the anomalies are accounted for when today&#x27;s much more accurate values of planetary masses are used in calculating orbits. When the planet was named, he interpreted its symbol as a monogram referring to himself and Lowell by the phrase &quot;Pickering-Lowell&quot;.

He claimed to have found vegetation on the Moon in 1921.

In 1923, he retired from Harvard University. He died on January 16, 1938, in Mandeville, Jamaica.

==Awards==
He won the Prix Lalande in 1905 and the Prix Jules Janssen in 1909. The asteroid 784 Pickeringia, and the craters Pickering on the Moon and Pickering on Mars, are jointly named after him and his brother Edward Charles Pickering.

<doc id="592096" wikidata="Q1322518" url="?curid=592096" title="Bobby Abreu">
<text>Bob Kelly Abreu (; ; born March 11, 1974), nicknamed &quot;El Comedulce&quot; and &quot;La Leche&quot;, is a Venezuelan former professional baseball outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Los Angeles Dodgers, and New York Mets.

Abreu is a two-time All-Star, and has won a Gold Glove Award and a Silver Slugger Award. He has been a single-season league leader in games played (twice), doubles, and triples. He had two seasons in which he collected thirty home runs and thirty stolen bases, making him one of thirteen players to have achieved the 30–30 club twice in a career. Through 2014, Abreu led active ballplayers in doubles (565), walks (1,456), and outfield assists (136), was fifth in runs scored (1,441) and stolen bases (400), seventh in extra-base hits (911) and on-base percentage (.396), and tenth in runs batted in (1,363). He is also one of only seven players ever to record at least 900 career extra-base hits and steal at least 400 bases along with Barry Bonds, Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker, Craig Biggio, Honus Wagner, and Paul Molitor. Of these, five are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Career==

===Houston Astros===
Abreu was signed as an amateur free agent by the Houston Astros on August 21, 1990. He was the Astros Minor League Player of the Year in 1996 and made his Major League debut on September 1, 1996, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was announced as a pinch hitter but did not get to bat because he was subsequently pinch hit for by Mike Simms. He had his first official at-bat the following day against the St. Louis Cardinals when he flied out to left field as a pinch hitter in the top of the sixth inning. After a few more appearances as a pinch hitter or late inning defensive replacement, he made his first start in left field against the Colorado Rockies on September 6, going hitless in four at-bats with two strikeouts. Abreu&#x27;s first Major League hit was a single to right field as a pinch hitter against Bobby Jones of the New York Mets on September 24. He finished his first season with five hits in 22 at-bats. He hit his first two home runs in the same game on April 28, 1997, against Jamey Wright and Steve Reed of the Colorado Rockies. He played in 59 games for the Astros in 1997, hitting .250 with three home runs and 26 RBI.

Left unprotected in the 1997 MLB Expansion Draft when the Astros decided to keep fellow Venezuelan outfielder Richard Hidalgo, Abreu was selected by the then Tampa Bay Devil Rays, only to be dealt hours later to the Phillies for shortstop Kevin Stocker, a trade regarded among the worst in MLB history.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
====1998–2003 seasons====
In 1998, his first season with the Phillies, Abreu led the team with a .312 batting average and collected 17 home runs, 74 RBI, and 19 stolen bases in 151 games, with 271 putouts and 17 assists in right field.
In 1999, Abreu made a brief run at the batting title. His .335 career-high average that season ranked third in the National League and was the highest posted by a Phillies player since outfielder Tony González hit .339 in 1967. His .446 career-high OBP was third in the league and he tied for the league lead in triples with 11.

In 2000, Abreu finished fourth in the league in triples (10), sixth in doubles (42), seventh in walks (100), and ninth in OBP (.416). Abreu became the first Phillie outfielder since Greg Luzinski with back-to-back 20 homer seasons. In 2001, Abreu led the NL in games played (162), and was third in walks (106), fourth in stolen bases (36) and doubles (48), and eighth in runs (118) and sacrifice flies (9). He also hit a career-high 31 home runs and had a career-high 110 RBI.

For the 2002 season, Abreu led the league in doubles (50), and was sixth in walks (104), seventh in stolen bases (31) and intentional walks (13), eighth in OBP (.413), ninth in hits (176), and tenth in runs (102). In 2003, Abreu was fourth in the league in walks (109), seventh in sacrifice flies (7), eighth in OBP (.409), and ninth in stolen bases (22).

====2004 season====
In 2004, Abreu got his first All-Star berth, being voted in as the National League All-Star Final Vote winner in online voting on MLB.com.

Abreu hit the first home run at Citizens Bank Park on Opening Day, April 12, 2004. He finished the season with a .301 average, 30 home runs, and 105 RBI, and ranked among the National League top five in five offensive categories: runs (fourth, 118) -- the third time in six years that he scored 118 runs, doubles (fourth, 47), stolen bases (third, 40—a career high), walks (second, 127—a career high) and on-base percentage (fifth, .428). Abreu became the first player in major league history to record 30 home runs, 40 doubles, 40 stolen bases, and 100 walks in a single season. He also led the Major Leagues in pitches-per-plate-appearance (4.32) and number of pitches seen (3,077), was eighth-highest in the league in total bases (312), and posted the league&#x27;s tenth-best OPS (.971).

====2005 season====
In May, Abreu was honored as the Player of the Month in the National League, after he hit .396 and 11 home runs. He also led the NL for the month in slugging average (.792), on-base percentage (.535), and walks (30) and was tied for the league lead with 30 RBI. He became the first player in Major League history to hit at least one home run in nine out of ten team games.

He was voted a starter in the NL outfield for the All-Star Game, finishing second in fan voting, behind St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Jim Edmonds. Prior to the All-Star Game at Comerica Park in Detroit, Abreu won the Home Run Derby as he set records with 24 home runs in a single round (since broken by Josh Hamilton in 2008), and 41 overall, topping Miguel Tejada&#x27;s previous marks of 15 and 27 set one year earlier. Abreu&#x27;s longest homer was measured at 517 feet, the third longest in Derby history.

===New York Yankees===

====2006 season====

On July 30, 2006, Abreu was traded along with Cory Lidle to the New York Yankees for minor league shortstop C. J. Henry (a 2005 first-round draft pick), left-hander Matt Smith (a seven-year minor league veteran), catcher Jesus Sanchez, and right-hander Carlos Monasterios—all low-level prospects in the Yankee organization. &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; columnist Bill Conlin called the trade &quot;the Great Gillick Giveaway&quot; and declared it &quot;an unvarnished disaster.&quot; The Phillies actually improved after the Abreu trade and made a run for the National League wild card, only to be eliminated on the second to last day of the season.

Abreu fit well into the Yankees lineup. He batted .297 with 15 home runs and 107 RBI in the 2006 season. The Yankees ran away with the AL East division title by mid-September 2006, but were eliminated by the Detroit Tigers in the 2006 American League Division Series.

In 2006, Abreu led the major leagues in walks (124), pitches per plate appearance (4.45), and number of pitches seen (3,056), and was second in the major leagues in percent of plate appearances that were walks (18.5%), and led the AL in percentage of pitches taken (66.2), and in walks per plate appearance (.181), third in batting average on balls in play (.375), eighth in on-base percentage (.424), 18th in stolen bases (30), and 19th in doubles (41).

On September 12, 2006, Abreu drove in six runs in the first inning of the Yankees&#x27; 12–4 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Abreu began the 9-run inning by homering with Johnny Damon and Derek Jeter on base, then concluded it with a bases-loaded double that scored Hideki Matsui, Melky Cabrera and Jeter. The six RBIs tied Gil McDougald&#x27;s 55-year franchise record for most in one inning (McDougald batted in six runs in one inning in 1951, his rookie season). Alex Rodriguez broke the record shared by Abreu and McDougald by driving in seven runs in the sixth inning of 2009 regular season finale, also against Tampa Bay.

====2007 and 2008 seasons====
After getting off to a slow start in (2007), Abreu finished the season strong putting up 101 RBI, 16 home runs and a .283 batting average. In 2007, Abreu was second in the AL in runs (123), third in pitches per plate appearance (4.38), ninth in games (158) and times on base (258), and tenth in walks (84) and plate appearances (699).

Abreu hit a walk-off double on July 9, 2008 against the Tampa Bay Rays. On September 18, Abreu hit two home runs and had 6 RBI in a game versus the Chicago White Sox and Javier Vázquez. He finished the season with a .296 average, 20 home runs, and 100 RBI. He had the last stolen base in the original Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008.

===Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===

====2009 season====

On February 12, 2009, Abreu signed a $5 million, one-year deal with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and was expected to play left field. However, after Vladimir Guerrero was moved to DH due to injury, Abreu saw more action at his natural position in right field.

After struggling early in the season, Abreu hit .380 with 28 RBI in 26 games in July and was named the American League Player of the Month. Abreu became the first Angels player to reach those figures in batting average and RBI in one calendar month since Tim Salmon, who hit .390 with 32 RBI in 27 games in July 1997.

On August 6, Abreu hit his 250th career home run when he led off the fifth inning with a solo home run off Chicago White Sox pitcher John Danks. Abreu became one of only six players in major league history to collect 250 home runs, 2,000 hits, 1,000 runs, 1,000 runs batted in, 1,000 walks and 300 stolen bases. In 2009, he led the AL in errors by an outfielder, with 8.

Though Abreu stated that he enjoyed his season with the Angels and was credited with helping many of the team&#x27;s younger players to improve their swings and patience at the plate, he turned down a two-year, $16 million extension on his contract on October 15.

====2010–2012 seasons====
On November 5, 2009, the first day eligible players could file for free agency, Abreu accepted a two-year deal with the Angels, with a club option for 2012. He cited the Angels manager, Mike Scioscia as one of the reasons, saying &quot;He&#x27;s one of those managers that lets you play the game, and he gives you big support.&quot; He also noted the organization publicly recognized his career achievements and consistently delivered opportunities to succeed in the postseason, saying, &quot;This is a team that gives you an opportunity always to be in the playoffs. This time, my first time with them, I was very close to getting to the World Series, so why not stay? Of course you want a team that is going to give you opportunities to be in the World Series and win the World Series. I don&#x27;t want to take a chance with someone else.&quot;

During the 2011–2012 offseason, the New York Yankees proposed a trade to the Angels that would have sent starting pitcher A. J. Burnett to Anaheim for Abreu. Abreu would have become the Yankees&#x27; regular designated hitter, but Burnett vetoed the trade. On February 20, 2012, Burnett was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Yankees signed Raúl Ibañez to be the DH. Abreu was already annoyed that he would not be playing every day for the Angels, and when he learned what Burnett had done, he ordered Angels&#x27; management to either play him every day as the designated hitter or trade him. Another proposed trade, which would have sent Abreu to the Cleveland Indians for Lou Marson, fell through. Abreu was released by the Angels on April 27, 2012 and replaced on the roster by future Rookie of the Year and MVP Award winner Mike Trout.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===

On May 4, 2012, Abreu signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was designated for assignment on August 1, 2012. Abreu cleared waivers and accepted an assignment to AAA Albuquerque. He had six hits in his 17 at-bats for the Isotopes before rejoining the Dodgers as a September call-up, spending the last month of the season as a pinch hitter. He played in 92 games with the Dodgers, hitting .246 with three home runs and 19 RBI.

===Second stint with Phillies===
After sitting out the 2013 season, Abreu participated in the 2013–14 Venezuelan Winter League and logged a .322 batting average in 180 plate appearances with Leones del Caracas. On January 21, 2014, Abreu signed a minor league contract with the Phillies. He was released before the season on March 27.

===New York Mets===

On March 31, 2014, Abreu signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets. On April 21, the Mets promoted Abreu from the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, after trading Ike Davis to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was designated for assignment on August 4 and officially released on August 10. However, just four days later on August 14, the Mets re-signed Abreu to another minor league contract. He was called back up to the majors on September 9, 2014. Abreu announced his retirement from baseball on September 26. He singled in his final at-bat on September 28.

==Batting style==
Abreu was noted for his plate discipline. In 2009, he led the American League in percent of pitches taken at 67.5%, while also having the fourth lowest percentage of swinging at the first pitch at 9.5%.

==Career statistics==
In 2,425 games over 18 seasons, Abreu posted a .291 batting average (2,470-for-8,480) with 1,453 runs, 574 doubles, 59 triples, 288 home runs, 1,363 RBI, 400 stolen bases, 1,476 bases on balls, .395 on-base percentage and .475 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .982 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions. In 20 postseason games, he hit .284 (19-for-67) with nine runs, six doubles, one home run, 9 RBI, two stolen bases and 12 walks.

Abreu logged 60.2 Wins Above Replacement (WAR). Among right fielders, this is 19th best all time, and he is one of 191 players as of 2025 with a WAR over 60.

===National Baseball Hall of Fame consideration===
Abreu was listed on 2020 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting; other than Derek Jeter, he was the only first-year candidate to receive at least 5% of the vote, enabling him to appear on the 2021 ballot, when he garnered 8.7%, thus qualifying him to appear on the 2022 ballot, where he fell to 8.6%. In 2023, he rose to 15.4%, but his support has stagnated since then, receiving 14.8% in 2024 and 19.5% in 2025, his 6th year of eligibility.

==Personal life==

Abreu dated former Miss Universe Alicia Machado; the couple later split, calling off their engagement.

Abreu is the owner of Mineros de Guyana, a soccer team based in Puerto Ordaz.
===In the community===
Abreu was involved in many events in the Philadelphia and Delaware Valley communities. In 2001, he was the Honorary Chairman for the American Red Cross Blood Drive.

Abreu bought $10,000 worth of tickets to most Friday night games for children in his &quot;Abreu&#x27;s Amigos&quot; organization during the 2003 and 2004 seasons. In this program, the children got jerseys, coupons for concessions, and chances to meet Abreu on the field during batting practice.

Abreu was the 2004 recipient of the Phillies Community Service award and the Phillies&#x27; representative for MLB&#x27;s Roberto Clemente Award.

In 2008, Abreu made a contribution to the Police Athletic League of New York City through his Abreu&#x27;s Finest charity to provide boys and girls with recreational, educational, cultural and social programs.

Abreu is known as &quot;El Comedulce&quot; in Venezuela. The name translates roughly to &quot;the candy-eater&quot;, which had been his father Nelson Abreu&#x27;s nickname. Following Nelson&#x27;s death, Abreu &quot;began asking people to call him the same name as a way of honoring his father&#x27;s memory.&quot;

<text>Narcisse-Achille, comte de Salvandy (; 11June 179516December 1856) was a French politician.

He was born at Condom, Gers of a poor family of Irish extraction. He joined the army in 1813, and in the following year joined the household troops of Louis XVIII of France. His patriotic pamphlet on &quot;La Coalition et la France&quot; (1816) attracted the attention of Elie, Comte Decazes, who employed him to disseminate his views in the press, and he waged war against the Jean-Baptiste, Comte de Villèle ministry of 1822–1828.

Under the July monarchy he sat almost continuously in the Chamber of Deputies from 1830 till 1848, remaining steadfast to his Moderate Liberal principles. Minister of education in Louis-Mathieu Molé&#x27;s cabinet of 1837–1839, and again in 1845, he superintended the reconstitution of the Council of Education, the foundation of the French School at Athens and the restoration of the École des Chartes.

For short periods in 1841 and 1843 he was ambassador at Madrid and at Turin, and became a member of the Académie française, the twelfth occupant of seat 1, in 1835. Under the Second French Empire he took no part in public affairs, and died at Graveron (Eure).

<doc id="592099" wikidata="Q3012884" url="?curid=592099" title="Killing of Damilola Taylor">
<text>On 27 November 2000, ten-year-old Nigerian schoolchild Damilola Taylor was killed in London, in what became one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most high-profile killings. Two brothers who were 12 and 13 at the time of the killing were convicted of manslaughter in 2006.

==Damilola Taylor==
Damilola Olufemi Taylor was born in Lagos, Nigeria on 7 December 1989 to Richard and Gloria Taylor, both from the Yoruba ethnic group. He attended Wisdom Montessori School in Ikosi, Ketu, Lagos before he travelled to the United Kingdom in August 2000 with his family to seek treatment for his sister&#x27;s epilepsy.

==Death==
At 4:51 pm on 27 November 2000, Taylor set off from Peckham Library, south east London, to walk home. Approaching the North Peckham Estate, he was attacked on Blakes Road with a glass bottle resulting in a gash to his left thigh and a severed artery. He was found in a stairwell on the estate and taken to King&#x27;s College Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

==Trials==
===First trial===
In 2002, four youths, including two 16-year-old brothers, went on trial at the Old Bailey for murder. The trial led to all four suspects being acquitted – two were acquitted on the direction of the judge after he ruled that the prosecution&#x27;s key witness, a 14-year-old girl, was unreliable; and the jury found the other two not guilty. As well as questioning the reliability of the witness, the defence presented expert witness testimony from Alastair Wilson, associate clinical director at the Royal London Hospital, that Taylor&#x27;s wounds were consistent with having fallen on a broken bottle whilst being attacked. This was disputed by the prosecution, who argued that Taylor would have had to &quot;take off and fly through the air like Peter Pan&quot; in order for Wilson&#x27;s theory to be correct. Wilson also admitted that &quot;he had not seen Damilola&#x27;s body or been given other information about the death.&quot; Pathologist Vesna Djurovic maintained that Taylor &quot;was stabbed deliberately [with a broken bottle] in the left thigh, probably while he was on the ground.&quot;

===New evidence===
Despite the acquittals, police vowed to keep the investigation open. New DNA techniques employed by Angela Gallop and her team identified Taylor&#x27;s blood on the trainers of Danny Preddie and on the sweatshirt cuff of his brother Ricky, neither of whom were among the four original suspects. This led to a re-examination of the evidence obtained at the time of Taylor&#x27;s death. In 2005, fresh arrests were made, and 19-year-old Hassan Jihad and brothers Danny and Rickie Preddie (aged 16 and 17) were charged with manslaughter. Due to their age, the Preddie brothers were not publicly named at the time of their arrest or during their trial.

===Second trial===
On 23 January 2006, Jihad (then 21 years old) and the Preddie brothers (then 17 and 18 years old) appeared at the Old Bailey to face charges of his manslaughter and assault before the start of their imminent trial. The trial commenced on 24 January 2006. Wilson again testified that he thought that Taylor had died after falling on a shard of glass from a broken bottle. After retiring on 29 March to consider its verdict, the jury cleared Jihad of all charges on 3 April. They were unable to reach a verdict on the charges of manslaughter against the two brothers, so they were released but with the possibility of a retrial on those charges.

===Retrial for manslaughter===
The retrial of the two brothers began on 23 June. As they were by then over 18, they were publicly named. Both defendants were known to police, having committed multiple robberies.

On 9 August 2006, the Preddie brothers were convicted of Taylor&#x27;s manslaughter after a 33-day retrial. During the retrial it was noted that while police followed procedure collecting evidence, lapses occurred in the prosecution. On 9 October, Mr Justice Goldring sentenced the brothers to eight years in youth custody for manslaughter.

Although it was widely reported in the media that Taylor&#x27;s parents were unhappy at the sentences, Goldring explained the sentence was determined by the age of the offenders at the time and that there was no evidence to suggest that there was premeditation. In addition, the bottle used had not been carried to the scene of the crime.

==Aftermath==
In May 2001, Richard and Gloria Taylor established the Damilola Taylor Trust in their son&#x27;s memory, and which campaigns against knife crime. Richard Taylor also dedicated his life to campaigning to improve the lives of disadvantaged children. In 2008, Richard Taylor organised a march against knife crime which took place in central London and was attended by several thousand young people, and led by Brooke Kinsella, whose brother, Ben Kinsella, was stabbed to death. In 2009, Richard Taylor was appointed as an anti-knife crime and youth violence envoy by Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and was awarded an OBE in the 2011 New Year Honours for his services to campaigning for youth charities. Gloria died from a heart attack in April 2008; Richard died on 23 March 2024 from prostate cancer.

Ricky Preddie was released on parole in September 2010, but recalled to prison in March 2011 for breaking the terms of his parole. He was released from prison again in February 2012. In February 2020, Ricky Preddie (also known as Ricky Johnson) was again jailed. He had driven his car into a police officer, leaving her with serious injuries. Preddie pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving; driving whilst disqualified; failing to stop; and driving without insurance. He was imprisoned for four years for the crimes.

== Perpetrators ==
Ricky Gavin Preddie and Danny Charles Preddie were born in Peckham, South London, to Alfred Preddie and Marion Johnson. Their father was a boxer from Jamaica who came to the UK during the 1960s. He later died in 2004, aged 53. The Preddie brothers joined the Peckham Boys gang in 1997 where their reputation began.

==In popular culture==
Children&#x27;s author Beverley Naidoo recalled how when she went to accept the Smarties Silver Award for her book &quot;The Other Side of Truth&quot; (2000), about two Nigerian child refugees, she heard the news of Taylor&#x27;s death. As a result, she organized an ongoing donation of 10p to the Refugee Council from every book sold.

Writer Stephen Kelman was nominated for the 2011 Man Booker Prize for his debut novel &quot;Pigeon English&quot;, inspired in part by the Taylor killing.

Actor John Boyega, then 8 years old, and his older sister Grace were among the last people to see Taylor alive. They were friends and the Boyegas helped watch him.

The BBC programme &quot;Panorama&quot; aired a special on the death of Taylor in April 2002. A 90-minute BBC dramatization of the events leading to his death and his family&#x27;s search for justice, &quot;Damilola, Our Loved Boy&quot;, premiered in November 2016 and won the BAFTA Award for a single drama.

In Black History Month 2020, Capital XTRA presenter Yinka Bokinni, a friend of Taylor, hosted a documentary about him for Channel 4 titled &quot;Damilola: The Boy Next Door&quot;.

In 2020, 7 December was declared Day of Hope to mark two decades since Taylor&#x27;s killing.

<doc id="592100" wikidata="Q716555" url="?curid=592100" title="Wong Kei-ying">
<text>Wong Kei-ying or Huang Qiying (c. 1815–1886) was a Chinese Hung Ga martial artist and physician of Cantonese ethnicity, who lived during the Qing dynasty. He was one of the Ten Tigers of Canton and was best known for his use of the Tiger Crane Paired Form Fist skill set. His son, Wong Fei-hung, who inherited his martial arts and medical skills, is commonly portrayed as a folk hero in Chinese popular culture.

==Life==
Wong was born in Luzhou Hamlet, Lingxi Village, Xiqiao Country, Foshan Town, Nanhai County, Guangzhou Prefecture, Guangdong Province, which is now part of Xiqiao Town, Nanhai District, Foshan City, during the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor. His date of birth is not known. Since his son, Wong Fei-hung, lived from 1847 to 1924, his year of birth was estimated to be between 1810 and 1820.

In his younger days, Wong earned a living by performing martial arts and acrobatics in the streets. One day, he encountered Luk Ah-choi (陸阿采; Lu A&#x27;cai), a notable practitioner of the martial art Hung Ga. Luk was also a student of Reverend Jee-sin, one of the legendary Five Elders who survived the destruction of Shaolin Monastery by the Qing government in the 17th or 18th century. Luk saw great potential in the young Wong, accepted him as an apprentice, and taught him martial arts. Another legend, which reflects historicity in the Hung Ga lineage, says that Wong learnt martial arts from his father, Wong Chun-kong (黃鎮江; ca. 1782–1867), also named as Wong Tai (黃泰), who was taught by Luk Ah-choi.

Wong spent ten years training and mastering all the skills he learnt, including the Single Hard Fist, Double Hard Fist, Taming the Tiger Fist, Mother and Son Butterfly Knives, Angry Tiger Fist, Fifth Brother Eight Trigram Pole, Flying Hook, Black Tiger Fist, and the well-known Tiger and Crane Paired Form Fist. Once his training was complete, Wong joined the Black Flag Army and became its martial arts instructor. However, as his wages were too low, he also opened a herbal medicine dispensary, Po Chi Lam (寶芝林), to earn additional income to support his wife Pok Lai-ngor (樸麗娥) and family.

Wong was named one of the Ten Tigers of Canton, a group of the ten most famous martial artists in Guangzhou (Canton) in the 19th century. His martial arts and medical skills were inherited by his son, Wong Fei-hung, who also became a famous martial artist and physician in his own right.

==In popular culture==
In the 1976 Shaw Brothers film &quot;Challenge of the Masters&quot;, he was portrayed by Yang Chiang.

In the 1978 film &quot;Ten Tigers of Shaolin&quot; (廣東十虎) produced by Mei Lam Film Production Company, he was portrayed by Wong Yuen-san.

In the many films about Wong Fei-hung, Wong Kei-ying had a more prominent screen presence in 1978 film &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, who was portrayed by Lam Kau.

In the 1979 film &quot;Ten Tigers from Kwangtung&quot; (廣東十虎與後五虎) produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio, he was portrayed by Wai Pak.

In the 1981 Shaw Brothers film &quot;Martial Club&quot;, he was portrayed by Ku Feng.

In the 1986 film &quot;Millionaires Express&quot;, he was portrayed by Jimmy Wang Yu.

In the 1993 films &quot;Once Upon a Time in China III&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in China IV&quot;, despite his death in 1886, Wong Kei-ying, being portrayed by Lau Shun, appeared as a supporting character with little screen time due to the real-life events that happened during Wong Fei-hung&#x27;s lifetime.

However the 1993 film &quot;Iron Monkey&quot; is a fictional depiction of the relationship between Wong Kei-ying and a ten-year-old Wong Fei-hung. It hints at how the younger Wong is shaped by the example of his father. He was portrayed by Donnie Yen.

In the 1994 films &quot;Drunken Master II&quot; and &quot;Drunken Master III&quot;, he was portrayed by Ti Lung and Adam Cheng respectively.

In the 1995 ATV and TVB television drama series &quot;Wong Fei Hung Series&quot;, he was again portrayed by Lau Shun.

In the 1999 ATV television drama series &quot;Ten Tigers of Guangdong&quot; (英雄之廣東十虎), he was portrayed by Eddy Ko.

In the 2002 television series &quot;The Young Wong Fei Hung&quot;, he was portrayed by He Zhonghua.

In the 2004 TVB television drama series &quot;Wong Fei Hung – Master of Kung Fu&quot;, he was portrayed by David Chiang.

In the 2014 film &quot;Rise of the Legend&quot;, he was portrayed by Tony Leung Ka-fai.

He was also shown as the main protagonist depicted as a young man in his youth in the 2017 TV movie, &quot;Master of the Shadowless Kick: Wong Kei-ying&quot;, which aired on HBO Asia. He was portrayed by Sun Hao Ran.

In the series of comic books &quot;Atomic Robo&quot; he is a member of a team of adventurers along with Nikola Tesla, Annie Oakley and Harry Houdini.

<text>Pierre-Antoine Lebrun (; 29 November 1785 – 27 May 1873) was a French poet.

==Biography==
Lebrun was born in Paris. An &quot;Ode à la grande armée&quot;, mistaken at the time for the work of Écouchard Lebrun, attracted Napoleon&#x27;s attention, and secured for the author a pension of 1200 francs. Lebrun&#x27;s plays, once famous, are now forgotten. They are: &quot;Ulysse&quot; (1814), &quot;Marie Stuart&quot; (1820), which obtained a great success, and &quot;Le Cid d&#x27;Andalousie&quot; (1825).

Lebrun visited Greece in 1820, and on his return to Paris he published in 1822 an ode on the death of Napoleon, which cost him his pension. In 1825 he was the guest of Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford. The coronation of Charles X in that year inspired the verses entitled &quot;La Vallée de Champrosay&quot;, which have, perhaps, done more to secure his fame than his more ambitious attempts.

In 1828 appeared his most important poem, &quot;Le Voyage en Grèce&quot;, and in the same year he was elected to the Academy. The revolution of 1830 opened up for him a public career; in 1831 he was made director of the &quot;Imprimerie Royale&quot;, and subsequently filled with distinction other public offices, becoming senator in 1853.

<doc id="592115" wikidata="Q171789" url="?curid=592115" title="FIFA Confederations Cup">
<text>The FIFA Confederations Cup was an international association football tournament for men&#x27;s national teams, held every four years by FIFA. It was contested by the holders of each of the six continental championships (AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, and UEFA), along with the current FIFA World Cup holder and the host nation, to bring the number of teams up to eight.

Between 2001 and 2017 (with an exception in 2003), the tournament was held in the country that would host the World Cup the following year, acting as a test event for the larger tournament.

The last champions were Germany, who won the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup by defeating Chile 1–0 in the final to win their first title.

In March 2019, FIFA confirmed that the tournament would no longer be staged, with its slot replaced by an expansion of the FIFA Club World Cup, as well as the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup, as a prelude to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

== History ==

=== King Fahd Cup === 
The tournament was originally organized by and held in Saudi Arabia, contested in 1992 and 1995 by the Saudi national side and some continental champions. Disputed as the King Fahd Cup (&quot;Confederations Winners Cup&quot; or &quot;Intercontinental Championship&quot;), it was named in honor of the then Saudi ruler who organized the tournament with the help of his country&#x27;s federation.

=== Confederations Cup era ===
In 1997, FIFA took over the organization of the tournament, named it the &quot;FIFA Confederations Cup&quot; and staged the competition every two years and recognized the first two editions in 1997.
After 2005, it was held every four years, in the year prior to each World Cup in the host country of the forthcoming World Cup (the 2001 edition was hosted in South Korea and Japan, before the quadrennial pattern was established). Considered a dress rehearsal for the World Cup it precedes, it used around half of the stadiums intended for use at the following year&#x27;s competition and gave the host nation, which qualified for that tournament automatically, experience at a high level of competition during the two years. At the same time, participation was made optional for the South American and European champions.

Generally, the host nation, the World Cup holders, and the six continental champions qualified for the competition. In those cases where a team meets more than one of the qualification criteria (such as the 2001 tournament where France qualified as the World Cup champions and European champions), another team was invited to participate, often the runner-up in a competition that the extra-qualified team won.

On four occasions teams have chosen not to participate in the tournament. Germany did so twice, in 1997 (replaced by Euro 1996 runners-up Czech Republic) and in 2003 when Germany were awarded a place as the 2002 World Cup runners-up, replaced by the third-placed team Turkey. World champions France declined a place in the 1999 Confederations Cup, replaced by Brazil, the 1998 World Cup runners-up. Italy, UEFA Euro 2000 runners up, declined their place in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup.
An earlier tournament that invited former World Cup winners, the 1980 Mundialito, celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the first World Cup. The Artemio Franchi Trophy, contested in 1985 and 1993 between the winners of the Copa América and UEFA European Championship, was another example of an earlier contest between football confederations. Both of these are considered by some to be a form of unofficial precursor to the Confederations Cup, although FIFA recognised only the 1992 tournaments onwards to be Confederations Cup winners.

=== 2021 tournament and abolition ===
The 2021 tournament was originally to be held in Qatar, the host country of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, as announced on 2 December 2010 after the country was awarded the hosting rights of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, concerns arose surrounding Qatar&#x27;s high temperatures during the summer period (which also led to calls for the World Cup to be moved from its traditional June–July scheduling to November–December).

On 25 February 2015, this resulted in FIFA officially announcing that it would move the 2021 Confederations Cup to another country of the Asian Football Confederation, so it could still be held during the traditional window of June/July 2021, without interrupting domestic leagues. As compensation, another FIFA tournament, potentially the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup, could be held in Qatar in November–December 2021, as the test event for the 2022 World Cup.

In October 2017, FIFA divulged plans to abolish the Confederations Cup by 2021 and replace it with a quadrennial, 24-team FIFA Club World Cup and move the latter tournament from December to June. On 15 March 2019, FIFA announced that the Confederations Cup would be abolished, with an expanded FIFA Club World Cup taking place instead.

===Present===
In July 2021, UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin and CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez began efforts to launch a competition including the winners of the Copa America and the European Championship. The idea is to have the European Championship and Copa America both be played two years ahead of the World Cup, with the new tournament played a year before the World Cup in the nation that will host the World Cup. An edition of the tournament was considered for 2022, and on 1 June 2022, Argentina beat Italy in the 2022 Finalissima, a relaunch of the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.

The eight qualified teams were drawn into two round-robin groups: two teams from the same confederation could not be drawn in a group, except if there were three teams from the same confederation (something that only happened in the 2017 edition when hosts Russia were joined by World Cup champions Germany and European champions Portugal). Every team played all other teams in their group once, for three matches.

The top two teams of each group advanced to the semi-finals, with the winners of each group playing the runners-up of the other group. The rankings of teams in each group were determined as follows (regulations Article 19.6):

If two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined as follows:
The winners of the semi-finals advanced to the final, while the losers played in the third-place game. For the knockout stage, if the score was drawn at the end of regular time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner.

<text>John Jeremy Lloyd (22 July 1930 – 23 December 2014) was an English writer, screenwriter, author, poet and actor. He was the co-writer of several successful British sitcoms, including &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;.

==Early years==
John Jeremy Lloyd was born in Danbury, Essex to a mother who had been a dancer, and a petroleum engineer father who served as an officer in the Royal Engineers at the beginning of World War II. As a child he was sent to live with his grandmother in Manchester and rarely saw his parents, who he claimed had seen him as a failure. His father withdrew him from a private preparatory school in 1943.

Lloyd then worked as a junior assistant in the menswear department at Simpsons of Piccadilly and many of the characters depicted in &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; were drawn from his recollections of his time there. He was also a travelling paint salesman and believed his early jobs gave him a better education than a university could have provided.

==Career==
Lloyd began his career as a writer in 1958 before making his film debut two years later in 1960 in &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot;, and appeared in numerous film and television comedies during the 1960s and 1970s. Notably, he was a regular performer on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; during the 1969–70 television season. Back in England, after he completed the season, he met actress Joanna Lumley. A decision had to be made as to whether he would return to the U.S. for the start of the new season or remain in the UK and marry Lumley. He never returned to the United States.

In &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) Lloyd is uncredited as a tall man dancing at the disco with Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. In &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), he is a restaurant patron, also uncredited. In 1969, he filmed a scene with Peter Sellers for &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;, which co-starred Ringo Starr. Lloyd can be seen in a boardroom meeting offering marketing slogans for a really big car, and suggests &quot;the gang&#x27;s all here back seat.&quot; In 1967 he played the eccentric chimney sweep, Berthram Fortesque Wynthrope-Smythe, aka Bert Smith, in &quot;The Avengers&quot; episode, &quot;From Venus With Love&quot;.

Lloyd&#x27;s first major success as a comedy writer was with &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; in 1972, on which he worked with David Croft. He and Croft subsequently produced &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, which was equally popular in the UK, and a spinoff of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot;, which aired in 1992. Lloyd wrote the poem/lyrics for the popular &quot;Captain Beaky&quot; album and books in 1980.

In 1993 Lloyd published his autobiography, titled with a phrase from &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, called &quot;Listen Very Carefully—I Shall Say this Only Once&quot; (BBC Books: ).

Lloyd was the subject of what was considered an urban legend, that he had been invited to a dinner party at the home of Sharon Tate on the night that she was murdered by followers of Charles Manson. However, the story was verified as true when the octogenarian was interviewed by Emma Freud on the BBC Radio 4 programme, &quot;Loose Ends&quot;, on 10 December 2011.

Lloyd was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to British comedy.

==Personal life==
Lloyd&#x27;s first marriage in 1955 to model Dawn Bailey lasted seven years. After their marriage ended, he was briefly engaged to the actress Charlotte Rampling. Lloyd then married actress Joanna Lumley in May 1970, but that union ended in September of the same year. In 1992 he married actress Collette Northrop. In August 2014, Lloyd married Elizabeth &quot;Lizzy&quot; Moberly.

==Death==
Lloyd died on 23 December 2014, aged 84, after being admitted to a London hospital with pneumonia. He was survived by his wife Elizabeth.

<text>The strange-horned chameleon (Kinyongia xenorhina), also known as Rwenzori plate-nosed chameleon or single welded-horn chameleon, is a species of chameleon. It is native to the rainforests of the Ruwenzori Mountains of western Uganda and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The strange-horned chameleon is named for the large protuberance extending from the top of its snout, particularly prominent on the males of the species. This feature is composed of two separate plates extending outwards from either side of the snout and merging at the end. This feature has also earned it the alternate common name single welded-horn chameleon. It also has a very high casque (a helmet-like structure towards the back of the skull). The head and casque are covered with enlarged, plate-like scales.

Strange-horned chameleons are olive to brown in color. Males range more towards olive and females more towards brown. They can reach a total length of . They have among the sharpest &quot;teeth&quot; and longest claws of any chameleon species.

The strange-horned chameleon has rarely been bred in captivity. Most of the current population is within the Rwenzori Mountains National Park. Suitable forest habitat has largely disappeared from outside the park, and some habitat destruction is also occurring inside the park. In addition, overcollecting for the live animal trade is a serious potential threat, even though the species is not much traded at present. The IUCN considers it near threatened. CITES lists it in the Appendix II.

<doc id="592121" wikidata="Q168235" url="?curid=592121" title="Tristan Garel-Jones">
<text>William Armand Thomas &quot;Tristan&quot; Garel-Jones, Baron Garel-Jones, PC (28 February 1941 – 23 March 2020) was a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Watford from 1979 to 1997, before being made a life peer in 1997.

Following his election to Parliament, Garel-Jones served in various whip positions and also as a junior minister at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

==Early life==
Born in Gorseinon, Wales, the son of Bernard Garel-Jones and Meriel (née Williams), he and his family moved first to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands prior to settling in Madrid, Spain, when he was seven years old. Garel-Jones was educated at the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury. His parents established successful language schools in Spain during this time. He moved back to the United Kingdom and worked as a merchant banker prior to embarking on a career in politics.

==Parliamentary career==
Garel-Jones first contested Caernarvon in February 1974, but was defeated by the future leader of Plaid Cymru, Dafydd Wigley. He was elected for Watford at the 1979 General Election.

===Whips Office===

Viewed as an effective whip who successfully delivered parliamentary votes in favour of Thatcher&#x27;s legislation, Garel-Jones was nonetheless seen as a mixture of Machiavelli and Ivan the Terrible by the Thatcherite right-wing. Although his loyalty to Thatcher was never questioned, nor his ability to stamp out a rebellion, his party&#x27;s &quot;dry&quot; (right wing) flank associated him with the Conservative &quot;wets&quot; (centrist) faction. He was seen as being to blame for the &quot;growing wetness&quot; of Thatcher&#x27;s government. His formidable reputation as an effective enforcer in the whips&#x27; office was said to have been the inspiration for the fictional scheming Whip Francis Urquhart in the novel &quot;House of Cards&quot; and subsequent BBC TV drama adaptation.

Others who knew him said &quot;where Dobbs’ character was a cold, machiavellian schemer, Garel-Jones was in reality a warm and enthusiastic person who cared deeply about human rights, equality, and the advancement of humanist ideals.&quot;

===Europe===

Garel-Jones was a leading pro-European, and remained so, despite the Conservative party moving to a more Eurosceptic position by the end of the Thatcher era. This created suspicion among right-wing Thatcherites, who thought of him as one of the &quot;wets&quot;. However, he voted for Margaret Thatcher in the first round of the leadership challenge by Michael Heseltine, but reserved the right to vote against her if it went to a second round. He subsequently voted for Douglas Hurd.

After he stepped down from the House of Commons in 1997, he was given a life peerage as Baron Garel-Jones, of Watford in the County of Hertfordshire.

== Other interests ==
Garel-Jones was a well-known Hispanophile. A dedicated defender of bullfighting, he worked as a bullfighting critic. He was also a supporter of Humanists UK, and a vice chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist Group. He was an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

== Personal life ==
In 1966, Garel-Jones married Catalina Garrigues Carnicer, niece of the Spanish bullfighting critic . They had four sons and a daughter. He lived in Candeleda, Spain, and died there on 23 March 2020.

Garel-Jones was a firm atheist and humanist, but held strong respect for the right to freedom of religion or belief. He built a chapel for his wife Catalina on his estate so that she could practice her religion comfortably, as well as a bench outside the chapel where he could &quot;smoke and contemplate more worldly concerns&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Garel-Jones was portrayed by Hugh Fraser in the 2004 BBC production of &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot;, and by Guy Henry in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Margaret&quot;.

<doc id="592124" wikidata="Q567016" url="?curid=592124" title="List of mayors of Hamburg">
<text>The following is a chronological list of mayors of Hamburg, a city-state in Germany. The mayors are the head of the city-state, part of the government of Hamburg. Since 1861, according to the constitution of 28 September 1860, the state has been governed by the ten-member Senate, which had previously been called the &quot;council&quot; (in the German language of that time: &quot;Rath&quot;). It is headed by the first mayor of Hamburg (German title: &quot;Erster Bürgermeister der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg&quot;) as the president of the Senate. The deputy is the second mayor.

For much of its history, Hamburg was a free imperial city and later a sovereign state; the position of First Mayor historically was equivalent to that of a sovereign head of state. In the 1871–1918 German Empire, the Hamburg First Mayor was equivalent to the federal princes of the 23 German monarchies (4 of whom held the title of King and the others holding titles such as Grand Duke, Duke or Sovereign Prince). Since 1918, the position is equivalent to that of the minister-presidents of the (West) German states.

Prior to World War I, the two mayors were elected for one-year terms. Until 1997, the first mayor was primus inter pares among, and was elected by, the members of the Senate. Since then, the Hamburg Parliament (German: &quot;Hamburgische Bürgerschaft&quot;) has elected the first mayor; the first mayor is able to appoint and dismiss other senators.

==1293–1860==
The function of burgomaster (mayor) was usually held simultaneously by three persons, serving as an executive college. One of the three being burgomaster in chief for a year, the second being the prior burgomaster in chief, the third being the upcoming one. Therefore, sometimes up to three names are mentioned for one year, since the names of the three appear in deeds, signed with or mentioning their names. The names in the list from 1239 until 1820 were archived in a book by Johann August Meister (1820). This is an incomplete list of burgomasters and uses the spelling in Meister&#x27;s book, which is preserved in the Hamburg state library. After 1820 the list were added by hand. On 6 August 1806 Hamburg gained sovereignty as an independent country. From 1811 to 1814 Hamburg was part of France in the Bouches-de-l&#x27;Elbe.

If another reference is not noted, all mayors are taken from: Domizlaff. &quot;Das Hamburger Rathaus&quot;.

== Hamburg (1860–1919) ==
Since 1860 Hamburg had a constitution. Members of the Hamburg senate were elected by the Hamburg Parliament—not coopted by the existing senate. They were lifelong members of the senate. From the three eldest and juristic trained members the senate elected annually the First Mayor of Hamburg (German title: &quot;Erster Bürgermeister der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg&quot;) – the presiding head – and his deputy (Second Mayor of the Free and Hanseatic city of Hamburg, German title: &quot;Zweiter Bürgermeister der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg&quot;).

;Description of the method
All mayors are taken from Domizlaff: &quot;Das Hamburger Rathaus&quot; and are listed in &quot;Erste Bürgermeister Hamburgs 1507–2008&quot;, only changes in dates are marked by an added reference.

== German Reich (1871–1945) ==

=== German Empire (1871–1918) ===


=== Weimar Republic (1919–1933) ===
During the German Revolution of 1918–1919 an &quot;Arbeiter- und Soldatenrat&quot; (workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; council) was formed. From 12 November 1918 to 1919, a chairman was the head of state and city government: Heinrich Lauffenberg (−1919), Carl Hense (1919). This is not mentioned in Domizlaff: &quot;Das Hamburger Rathaus&quot;. The period in Germany after the First World War until the takeover of power – by the Nazi Party in 1933 – is called Weimar Republic. The Hamburg Parliament was democratically elected.
;First Mayor of Hamburg

;Second Mayor of Hamburg
=== Nazi Germany (1933–1945) ===
In Nazi Germany the &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot; (&quot;Gesetz über den Neuaufbau des Reiches&quot;) of 30 January 1934 abandoned the concept of a federal republic. The political institutions of the Länder were abolished altogether, passing all powers to the central government. The Hamburg Parliament was dissolved. The First Mayor was appointed by the Reich Interior Minister, though Hitler himself reserved the right to appoint him (as was also the case with Berlin and Vienna). The actual head of the Hamburg executive was the &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (Regional Governor) Karl Kaufmann (1933–1945).
;Second Mayor 
Colonel Robert Gordon Kitchen VI, Governor of Hamburg during the control of the British Army 1945–1946.

<doc id="592127" wikidata="Q1002123" url="?curid=592127" title="Mottled duck">
<text>The mottled duck (Anas fulvigula) or mottled mallard is a medium-sized species of dabbling duck. It is intermediate in appearance between the female mallard and the American black duck. It is closely related to those species, and is sometimes erroneously considered a subspecies of the former.

Along the Gulf of Mexico coast, the mottled duck is one of the most frequently banded waterfowl. This is due in part to the fact that it is mostly non-migratory. Approximately one out of every 20 mottled ducks is banded, making it an extremely prized and sought after bird among hunters.

==Subspecies==
There are two distinct subspecies of the mottled duck. One subspecies, the Gulf Coast mottled duck (&quot;A. f. maculosa&quot;), lives on the Gulf of Mexico coast between Alabama and Tamaulipas (Mexico); outside the breeding season, individual birds may venture as far south as Veracruz. The other, the Florida mottled duck (&quot;A. f. fulvigula&quot;), is resident in central and southern Florida and occasionally strays north to Georgia. The same disjunct distribution pattern was also historically found in the local sandhill cranes. Individuals of both subspecies were introduced into South Carolina in the 1970s and 1980s, where the birds of mixed ancestry have greatly expanded in range, extending through the Atlantic coastal plain of Georgia into northeastern Florida.

==Description==
The adult mottled duck is long from head to tail. It has a dark body, lighter head and neck, orange legs and dark eyes. Both sexes have a shiny green-blue speculum (wing patch), which is not bordered with white as with the mallard. Males and females are similar, but the male&#x27;s bill is bright yellow, whereas the female&#x27;s is deep to pale orange, occasionally lined with black splotches around the edges and near the base.

The plumage is darker than in female mallards, especially at the tail, and the bill is yellower. In flight, the lack of a white border to the speculum is a key difference. The American black duck is darker than most mottled ducks, and its wing-patch is more purple than blue. The behaviour and voice are the same as the mallard.

Mottled ducks feed by dabbling in shallow water, and grazing on land. They mainly eat plants, but also some mollusks and aquatic insects. The ducks are fairly common within their restricted range; they are resident all-year round and do not migrate. Their breeding habitat is brackish and intermediate coastal marshes, but they will also use human developed habitat such as retaining ponds, water impoundments, and agricultural land during the breeding season. According to a review of their breeding behaviors, mottled duck nests may be found in &quot;pastures, levees, dry cordgrass marsh, cutgrass marsh, spoil banks, and small islands.&quot;

==Systematics==
The Floridian population, which occurs approximately south of Tampa, is separated as the nominate subspecies &quot;Anas fulvigula fulvigula&quot; and is occasionally called the Florida mottled duck or Florida mallard. It differs from the other subspecies, the Gulf Coast mottled duck (&quot;A. f. maculosa&quot;) (etymology: &quot;maculosa&quot;, Latin for &quot;the mottled one&quot;), by being somewhat lighter in color and less heavily marked; while both subspecies are intermediate between female mallards and American black ducks, the Florida mottled duck is closer to the former and the Gulf Coast mottled duck closer to the latter in appearance; this is mainly recognizable in the lighter head being quite clearly separated from the darker breast in Gulf Coast mottled ducks, but much less so in Florida mottled ducks. As the subspecies&#x27; ranges do not overlap, these birds can only be confused with female mallards and American black ducks however; particularly female American black ducks are often only reliably separable by their dark purple speculum from mottled ducks in the field.

mtDNA control region sequence data indicates that these birds are derived from ancestral American black ducks, being far more distantly related to the mallard, and that the two subspecies, as a consequence of their rather limited range and sedentary habits, are genetically well distinct already.
As in all members of the &quot;mallardine&quot; clade of ducks, they are able to produce fertile hybrids with their close relatives, the American black duck and the mallard. This has always been so to a limited extent; individuals of the migratory American black ducks which winter in the mottled duck&#x27;s range may occasionally stay there and mate with the resident species, and for the mallard, which colonized North America later, the same holds true. Genetic tools have been developed in order to robustly classify hybrids and to assess and monitor the genetic dynamics of introgression between the Florida mottled duck and the mallard.

While the resultant gene flow is no cause for immediate concern, habitat destruction and excessive hunting could eventually reduce this species to the point where the hybridization with mallards would threaten to make it disappear as a distinct taxon. This especially applies to the Florida mottled duck, in the fairly small range of which rampant habitat destruction due to urbanization and draining of wetlands has taken place in the last decades; this, in combination with climate change affecting the Everglades, could be sufficient to cause the Florida mottled duck to decline to a point where hunting would have to be restricted or prohibited. At present, these birds too appear to be holding their own, with a population of 50,000-70,000 individuals. While hybridization is common, double white bars above and below the speculum are not a sufficient indicator of hybridization and therefore should not be used to determine genetics.

<text>Palladian architecture is a European architectural style derived from the work of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio (1508–1580). What is today recognised as Palladian architecture evolved from his concepts of symmetry, perspective and the principles of formal classical architecture from ancient Greek and Roman traditions. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Palladio&#x27;s interpretation of this classical architecture developed into the style known as Palladianism.

Palladianism emerged in England in the early 17th century, led by Inigo Jones, whose Queen&#x27;s House at Greenwich has been described as the first English Palladian building. Its development faltered at the onset of the English Civil War. After the Stuart Restoration, the architectural landscape was dominated by the more flamboyant English Baroque. Palladianism returned to fashion after a reaction against the Baroque in the early 18th century, fuelled by the publication of a number of architectural books, including Palladio&#x27;s own &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (&quot;The Four Books of Architecture&quot;) and Colen Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;. Campbell&#x27;s book included illustrations of Wanstead House, a building he designed on the outskirts of London and one of the largest and most influential of the early neo-Palladian houses. The movement&#x27;s resurgence was championed by Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, whose buildings for himself, such as Chiswick House and Burlington House, became celebrated. Burlington sponsored the career of the artist, architect and landscaper William Kent, and their joint creation, Holkham Hall in Norfolk, has been described as &quot;the most splendid Palladian house in England&quot;. By the middle of the century Palladianism had become almost the national architectural style, epitomised by Kent&#x27;s Horse Guards at the centre of the nation&#x27;s capital.

The Palladian style was also widely used throughout Europe, often in response to English influences. In Prussia the critic and courtier Francesco Algarotti corresponded with Burlington about his efforts to persuade Frederick the Great of the merits of the style, while Knobelsdorff&#x27;s opera house in Berlin on the Unter den Linden, begun in 1741, was based on Campbell&#x27;s Wanstead House. Later in the century, when the style was losing favour in Europe, Palladianism had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America. Thomas Jefferson sought out Palladian examples, which themselves drew on buildings from the time of the Roman Republic, to develop a new architectural style for the American Republic. Examples include the Hammond–Harwood House in Maryland and Jefferson&#x27;s own house, Monticello, in Virginia. The Palladian style was also adopted in other British colonies, including those in the Indian subcontinent.

In the 19th century, Palladianism was overtaken in popularity by Neoclassical architecture in both Europe and in North America. By the middle of that century, both were challenged and then superseded by the Gothic Revival in the English-speaking world, whose champions such as Augustus Pugin, remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples, deemed the style too pagan for true Christian worship. In the 20th and 21st centuries, Palladianism has continued to evolve as an architectural style; its pediments, symmetry and proportions are evident in the design of many modern buildings, while its inspirer is regularly cited as having been among the world&#x27;s most influential architects.

==Palladio&#x27;s architecture==
Andrea Palladio was born in Padua in 1508, the son of a stonemason. He was inspired by Roman buildings, the writings of Vitruvius (80 BC), and his immediate predecessors Donato Bramante and Raphael. Palladio aspired to an architectural style that used symmetry and proportion to emulate the grandeur of classical buildings. His surviving buildings are in Venice, the Veneto region, and Vicenza, and include villas and churches such as the Basilica del Redentore in Venice. Palladio&#x27;s architectural treatises follow the approach defined by Vitruvius and his 15th-century disciple Leon Battista Alberti, who adhered to principles of classical Roman architecture based on mathematical proportions rather than the ornamental style of the Renaissance. Palladio recorded and publicised his work in the 1570 four-volume illustrated study, &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (The Four Books of Architecture).

Palladio&#x27;s villas are designed to fit with their setting. If on a hill, such as Villa Almerico Capra Valmarana (Villa Capra, or La Rotonda), façades were of equal value so that occupants could enjoy views in all directions. Porticos were built on all sides to enable the residents to appreciate the countryside while remaining protected from the sun. Palladio sometimes used a loggia as an alternative to the portico. This is most simply described as a recessed portico, or an internal single storey room with pierced walls that are open to the elements. Occasionally a loggia would be placed at second floor level over the top of another loggia, creating what was known as a double loggia. Loggias were sometimes given significance in a façade by being surmounted by a pediment. Villa Godi&#x27;s focal point is a loggia rather than a portico, with loggias terminating each end of the main building.
Palladio would often model his villa elevations on Roman temple façades. The temple influence, often in a cruciform design, later became a trademark of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated basement or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms; above this, the &quot;piano nobile&quot; (noble level), accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms; and lastly a low mezzanine floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room (for example, height and width) within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5. The arrangement of the different rooms within the house, and the external façades, were similarly determined. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical façade; however, Palladio&#x27;s designs related to the entire structure. Palladio set out his views in &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot;: &quot;beauty will result from the form and correspondence of the whole, with respect to the several parts, of the parts with regard to each other, and of these again to the whole; that the structure may appear an entire and complete body, wherein each member agrees with the other, and all necessary to compose what you intend to form.&quot;

Palladio considered the dual purpose of his villas as the centres of farming estates and weekend retreats. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings, or barchessas, sweeping away from them to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by colonnades, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate the villa. Palladio did not intend them to be part of the main house, but the development of the wings to become integral parts of the main building – undertaken by Palladio&#x27;s followers in the 18th century – became one of the defining characteristics of Palladianism.

== Venetian and Palladian windows ==

Palladian, Serlian, or Venetian windows are a trademark of Palladio&#x27;s early career. There are two different versions of the motif: the simpler one is called a Venetian window, and the more elaborate a Palladian window or &quot;Palladian motif&quot;, although this distinction is not always observed.

The Venetian window has three parts: a central high round-arched opening, and two smaller rectangular openings to the sides. The side windows are topped by lintels and supported by columns. This is derived from the ancient Roman triumphal arch, and was first used outside Venice by Donato Bramante and later mentioned by Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554) in his seven-volume architectural book &quot;Tutte l&#x27;opere d&#x27;architettura et prospetiva&quot; (&quot;All the Works of Architecture and Perspective&quot;) expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture. It can be used in series, but is often only used once in a façade, as at New Wardour Castle, or once at each end, as on the inner façade of Burlington House (true Palladian windows).

Palladio&#x27;s elaboration of this, normally used in a series, places a larger or giant order in between each window, and doubles the small columns supporting the side lintels, placing the second column behind rather than beside the first. This was introduced in the in Venice by Jacopo Sansovino (1537), and heavily adopted by Palladio in the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza, where it is used on both storeys; this feature was less often copied. The openings in this elaboration are not strictly windows, as they enclose a loggia. Pilasters might replace columns, as in other contexts. Sir John Summerson suggests that the omission of the doubled columns may be allowed, but the term &quot;Palladian motif&quot; should be confined to cases where the larger order is present.
Palladio used these elements extensively, for example in very simple form in his entrance to Villa Forni Cerato. It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the Veneto that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window has become one of the most enduring features of Palladio&#x27;s work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism. According to James Lees-Milne, its first appearance in Britain was in the remodelled wings of Burlington House, London, where the immediate source was in the English court architect Inigo Jones&#x27;s designs for Whitehall Palace rather than drawn from Palladio himself. Lees-Milne describes the Burlington window as &quot;the earliest example of the revived Venetian window in England&quot;.

A variant, in which the motif is enclosed within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Richard Boyle seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall. Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to Vincenzo Scamozzi. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of Tottenham Park in Savernake Forest for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). William Kent used it in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in his executed designs for the north front of Holkham Hall. Another example is Claydon House, in Buckinghamshire; the remaining fragment is one wing of what was intended to be one of two flanking wings to a vast Palladian house. The scheme was never completed and parts of what was built have since been demolished.

== Early Palladianism ==

During the 17th century, many architects studying in Italy learned of Palladio&#x27;s work, and on returning home adopted his style, leading to its widespread use across Europe and North America. Isolated forms of Palladianism throughout the world were brought about in this way, although the style did not reach the zenith of its popularity until the 18th century. An early reaction to the excesses of Baroque architecture in Venice manifested itself as a return to Palladian principles. The earliest neo-Palladians there were the exact contemporaries Domenico Rossi (1657–1737) and Andrea Tirali (1657–1737). Their biographer, Tommaso Temanza, proved to be the movement&#x27;s most able proponent; in his writings, Palladio&#x27;s visual inheritance became increasingly codified and moved towards neoclassicism.

The most influential follower of Palladio was Inigo Jones, who travelled throughout Italy with the art collector Earl of Arundel in 1613–1614, annotating his copy of Palladio&#x27;s treatise. The &quot;Palladianism&quot; of Jones and his contemporaries and later followers was a style largely of façades, with the mathematical formulae dictating layout not strictly applied. A handful of country houses in England built between 1640 and 1680 are in this style. These follow the success of Jones&#x27;s Palladian designs for the Queen&#x27;s House at Greenwich, the first English Palladian house, and the Banqueting House at Whitehall, the uncompleted royal palace in London of Charles I.

Palladian designs advocated by Jones were too closely associated with the court of Charles I to survive the turmoil of the English Civil War. Following the Stuart restoration, Jones&#x27;s Palladianism was eclipsed by the Baroque designs of such architects as William Talman, Sir John Vanbrugh, Nicholas Hawksmoor, and Jones&#x27;s pupil John Webb.

==Neo-Palladianism==

=== English Palladian architecture ===

The Baroque style proved highly popular in continental Europe, but was often viewed with suspicion in England, where it was considered &quot;theatrical, exuberant and Catholic.&quot; It was superseded in Britain in the first quarter of the 18th century when four books highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture. These were:
* &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot; &quot;(The British Architect)&quot;, published by Colen Campbell in 1715 (of which supplemental volumes appeared through the century);
* &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; &quot;(The Four Books of Architecture)&quot;, by Palladio himself, translated by Giacomo Leoni and published from 1715 onwards;
* &quot;(On the Art of Building)&quot;, by Leon Battista Alberti, translated by Giacomo Leoni and published in 1726; and
* &quot;The Designs of Inigo Jones... with Some Additional Designs&quot;, published by William Kent in two volumes in 1727. A further volume, &quot;Some Designs of Mr. Inigo Jones and Mr. William Kent&quot; was published in 1744 by the architect John Vardy, an associate of Kent.

The most favoured among patrons was the four-volume &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot; by Campbell, The series contains architectural prints of British buildings inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio; at first mainly those of Inigo Jones, but the later works contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. These four books greatly contributed to Palladian architecture becoming established in 18th-century Britain. Campbell and Kent became the most fashionable and sought-after architects of the era. Campbell had placed his 1715 designs for the colossal Wanstead House near to the front of &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;, immediately following the engravings of buildings by Jones and Webb, &quot;as an exemplar of what new architecture should be&quot;. On the strength of the book, Campbell was chosen as the architect for Henry Hoare I&#x27;s Stourhead house. Hoare&#x27;s brother-in-law, William Benson, had designed Wilbury House, the earliest 18th-century Palladian house in Wiltshire, which Campbell had also illustrated in &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;.
At the forefront of the new school of design was the &quot;architect earl&quot;, Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, according to Dan Cruikshank the &quot;man responsible for this curious elevation of Palladianism to the rank of a quasi-religion&quot;. In 1729 he and Kent designed Chiswick House. This house was a reinterpretation of Palladio&#x27;s Villa Capra, but purified of 16th century elements and ornament. This severe lack of ornamentation was to be a feature of English Palladianism.

In 1734 Kent and Burlington designed Holkham Hall in Norfolk. James Stevens Curl considers it &quot;the most splendid Palladian house in England&quot;. The main block of the house followed Palladio&#x27;s dictates, but his low, often detached, wings of farm buildings were elevated in significance. Kent attached them to the design, banished the farm animals, and elevated the wings to almost the same importance as the house itself. It was the development of the flanking wings that was to cause English Palladianism to evolve from being a pastiche of Palladio&#x27;s original work. Wings were frequently adorned with porticos and pediments, often resembling, as at the much later Kedleston Hall, small country houses in their own right.
Architectural styles evolve and change to suit the requirements of each individual client. When in 1746 the Duke of Bedford decided to rebuild Woburn Abbey, he chose the fashionable Palladian style, and selected the architect Henry Flitcroft, a protégé of Burlington. Flitcroft&#x27;s designs, while Palladian in nature, had to comply with the Duke&#x27;s determination that the plan and footprint of the earlier house, originally a Cistercian monastery, be retained. The central block is small, has only three bays, while the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of state rooms replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block and given Palladian windows, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in many houses and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Often the terminating blocks would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very far removed from the designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, the approach was revived by Sir Aston Webb for his refacing of Buckingham Palace in 1913.

The villa tradition continued throughout the late 18th century, particularly in the suburbs around London. Sir William Chambers built many examples, such as Parkstead House. But the grander English Palladian houses were no longer the small but exquisite weekend retreats that their Italian counterparts were intended as. They had become &quot;power houses&quot;, in Sir John Summerson&#x27;s words, the symbolic centres of the triumph and dominance of the Whig Oligarchy who ruled Britain unchallenged for some fifty years after the death of Queen Anne. Summerson thought Kent&#x27;s Horse Guards on Whitehall epitomised &quot;the establishment of Palladianism as the official style of Great Britain&quot;. As the style peaked, thoughts of mathematical proportion were swept away. Rather than square houses with supporting wings, these buildings had the length of the façade as their major consideration: long houses often only one room deep were deliberately deceitful in giving a false impression of size.

=== Irish Palladian architecture ===

During the Palladian revival period in Ireland, even modest mansions were cast in a neo-Palladian mould. Irish Palladian architecture subtly differs from the England style. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them. In Ireland, Palladianism became political; both the original and the present Irish parliaments in Dublin occupy Palladian buildings.

The Irish architect Sir Edward Lovett Pearce (1699–1733) became a leading advocate. He was a cousin of Sir John Vanbrugh, and originally one of his pupils. He rejected the Baroque style, and spent three years studying architecture in France and Italy before returning to Ireland. His most important Palladian work is the former Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin. Christine Casey, in her 2005 volume &quot;Dublin&quot;, in the Pevsner Buildings of Ireland series, considers the building, &quot;arguably the most accomplished public set-piece of the Palladian style in [Britain]&quot;. Pearce was a prolific architect who went on to design the southern façade of Drumcondra House in 1725 and Summerhill House in 1731, which was completed after his death by Richard Cassels. Pearce also oversaw the building of Castletown House near Dublin, designed by the Italian architect Alessandro Galilei (1691–1737). It is perhaps the only Palladian house in Ireland built with Palladio&#x27;s mathematical ratios, and one of a number of Irish mansions which inspired the design of the White House in Washington, D.C.

Other examples include Russborough, designed by Richard Cassels, who also designed the Palladian Rotunda Hospital in Dublin and Florence Court in County Fermanagh. Irish Palladian country houses often feature robust Rococo plasterwork – an Irish specialty which was frequently executed by the Lafranchini brothers and far more flamboyant than the interiors of their contemporaries in England. In the 20th century, during and following the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent civil war, large numbers of Irish country houses, including some fine Palladian examples such as Woodstock House, were abandoned to ruin or destroyed.

=== North American Palladian architecture ===

Palladio&#x27;s influence in North America is evident almost from its first architect-designed buildings. The Irish philosopher George Berkeley, who may be America&#x27;s first recorded Palladian, bought a large farmhouse in Middletown, Rhode Island, in the late 1720s, and added a Palladian doorcase derived from Kent&#x27;s &quot;Designs of Inigo Jones&quot; (1727), which he may have brought with him from London. Palladio&#x27;s work was included in the library of a thousand volumes amassed for Yale College. Peter Harrison&#x27;s 1749 designs for the Redwood Library in Newport, Rhode Island, borrow directly from Palladio&#x27;s &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot;, while his plan for the Newport Brick Market, conceived a decade later, is also Palladian.

Two colonial period houses that can be definitively attributed to designs from &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; are the Hammond-Harwood House (1774) in Annapolis, Maryland, and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s first Monticello (1770). Hammond-Harwood was designed by the architect William Buckland in 1773–1774 for the wealthy farmer Matthias Hammond of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The design source is the Villa Pisani, and that for the first Monticello, the Villa Cornaro at Piombino Dese. Both are taken from Book II, Chapter XIV of &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot;. Jefferson later made substantial alterations to Monticello, known as the second Monticello (1802–1809), making the Hammond-Harwood House the only remaining house in North America modelled directly on a Palladian design.

Jefferson referred to &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; as his bible. Although a statesman, his passion was architecture, and he developed an intense appreciation of Palladio&#x27;s architectural concepts; his designs for the James Barbour Barboursville estate, the Virginia State Capitol, and the University of Virginia campus were all based on illustrations from Palladio&#x27;s book. Realising the political significance of ancient Roman architecture to the fledgling American Republic, Jefferson designed his civic buildings, such as The Rotunda, in the Palladian style, echoing in his buildings for the new republic examples from the old.

In Virginia and the Carolinas, the Palladian style is found in numerous plantation houses, such as Stratford Hall, Westover Plantation and Drayton Hall. Westover&#x27;s north and south entrances, made of imported English Portland stone, were patterned after a plate in William Salmon&#x27;s &quot;Palladio Londinensis&quot; (1734). The distinctive feature of Drayton Hall, its two-storey portico, was derived from Palladio, as was Mount Airy, in Richmond County, Virginia, built in 1758–1762. A particular feature of American Palladianism was the re-emergence of the great portico which, as in Italy, fulfilled the need of protection from the sun; the portico in various forms and size became a dominant feature of American colonial architecture. In the north European countries the portico had become a mere symbol, often closed, or merely hinted at in the design by pilasters, and sometimes in very late examples of English Palladianism adapted to become a porte-cochère; in America, the Palladian portico regained its full glory.
The White House in Washington, D.C., was inspired by Irish Palladianism. Its architect James Hoban, who built the executive mansion between 1792 and 1800, was born in Callan, County Kilkenny, in 1762, the son of tenant farmers on the estate of Desart Court, a Palladian House designed by Pearce. He studied architecture in Dublin, where Leinster House (built ) was one of the finest Palladian buildings of the time. Both Cassel&#x27;s Leinster House and James Wyatt&#x27;s Castle Coole have been cited as Hoban&#x27;s inspirations for the White House but the more neoclassical design of that building, particularly of the South façade which closely resembles Wyatt&#x27;s 1790 design for Castle Coole, suggests that Coole is perhaps the more direct progenitor. The architectural historian Gervase Jackson-Stops describes Castle Coole as &quot;a culmination of the Palladian traditions, yet strictly neoclassical in its chaste ornament and noble austerity&quot;, while Alistair Rowan, in his 1979 volume, &quot;North West Ulster&quot;, of the Buildings of Ireland series, suggests that, at Coole, Wyatt designed a building, &quot;more massy, more masculine and more totally liberated from Palladian practice than anything he had done before.&quot;

Because of its later development, Palladian architecture in Canada is rarer. In her 1984 study, &quot;Palladian Style in Canadian Architecture&quot;, Nathalie Clerk notes its particular impact on public architecture, as opposed to the private houses in the United States. One example of historical note is the Nova Scotia Legislature building, completed in 1819. Another example is Government House in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

===Palladianism elsewhere===

The rise of neo-Palladianism in England contributed to its adoption in Prussia. Count Francesco Algarotti wrote to Lord Burlington to inform him that he was recommending to Frederick the Great the adoption in his own country of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England. By 1741, Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff had already begun construction of the Berlin Opera House on the Unter den Linden, based on Campbell&#x27;s Wanstead House.

Palladianism was particularly adopted in areas under British colonial rule. Examples can be seen in the Indian subcontinent; the Raj Bhavan, Kolkata (formerly Government House) was modelled on Kedleston Hall, while the architectural historian Pilar Maria Guerrieri identifies its influences in Lutyens&#x27; Delhi. In South Africa, Federico Freschi notes the &quot;Tuscan colonnades and Palladian windows&quot; of Herbert Baker&#x27;s Union Buildings.

== Legacy ==

By the 1770s, British architects such as Robert Adam and William Chambers were in high demand, but were now drawing on a wide variety of classical sources, including from ancient Greece, so much so that their forms of architecture became defined as neoclassical rather than Palladian. In Europe, the Palladian revival ended by the close of the 18th century. In the 19th century, proponents of the Gothic Revival such as Augustus Pugin, remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples, considered it pagan, and unsuited to Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship. In North America, Palladianism lingered a little longer; Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s floor plans and elevations owe a great deal to Palladio&#x27;s &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura.&quot;

The term &quot;Palladian&quot; is often misused in modern discourse and tends to be used to describe buildings with any classical pretensions. There was a revival of a more serious Palladian approach in the 20th century when Colin Rowe, an influential architectural theorist, published his essay, &quot;The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa&quot;, (1947), in which he drew links between the compositional &quot;rules&quot; in Palladio&#x27;s villas and Le Corbusier&#x27;s villas at Poissy and Garches. Suzanne Walters&#x27; article &quot;The Two Faces of Modernism&quot; suggests a continuing influence of Palladio&#x27;s ideas on architects of the 20th century. In the 21st century Palladio&#x27;s name regularly appears among the world&#x27;s most influential architects. In England, Raymond Erith (1904–1973) drew on Palladian inspirations, and was followed in this by his pupil, subsequently partner, Quinlan Terry. Their work, and that of others, led the architectural historian John Martin Robinson to suggest that &quot;the &quot;Quattro Libri&quot; continues as the fountainhead of at least one strand in the English country house tradition.&quot;

<text>John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford (6 July 1766 – 20 October 1839), known as Lord John Russell until 1802, was a British Whig politician who notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the Ministry of All the Talents. He was the father of Prime Minister John Russell, 1st Earl Russell.

==Background==
Bedford was a younger son of Francis Russell, Marquess of Tavistock, eldest son and heir of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford. His mother was Lady Elizabeth, the youngest child of Willem van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle and Lady Anne Lennox.

==Political career==
Like most Russells, Bedford was a Whig in politics. He sat as Member of Parliament for Tavistock from 1788 to June 1790 and from December 1790 to 1802, when he was automatically elevated to the Lords on the death of his brother. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland during the Whig government of 1806–1807. He became, as did many of his party who were strong followers of Bonapartism, opposed to the Peninsular War, believing that it neither could nor should be won. He funded, along with his son, many anti-war publications. Bedford was sworn of the Privy Council in 1806 and appointed a Knight of the Garter in 1830.

==Family==
Bedford married firstly the Hon. Georgiana Byng, daughter of George Byng, 4th Viscount Torrington, in 1786. The marriage lasted 15 years and they had three sons:

*Francis Russell, 7th Duke of Bedford
*Lord George William Russell
*Lord John Russell, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and grandfather of philosopher Bertrand Russell.

After Georgiana&#x27;s early death in October 1801, Bedford married secondly Lady Georgiana, daughter of Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, in 1803. They had ten children, including:


* Reverend Lord Wriothesley Russell (11 May 1804 – 6 April 1886), married Elizabeth Russell, his first cousin, and had issue
* Admiral Lord Edward Russell (24 April 1805 – 21 May 1887), married Mary Ann Taylor and died without issue
* Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Charles James Fox Russell (10 February 1807 – 29 June 1894), married Isabella Davies and had issue
* Lady Georgiana Elizabeth Russell (23 June 1810 – 22 March 1867), married Charles Romilly and had issue
* Lady Louisa Jane Russell (8 July 1812 – 31 March 1905), married James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Abercorn and had issue.
* Lord Cosmo Russell (1817–1875)
* General Lord Alexander Russell (16 September 1821 – 10 January 1907), married Anne Holmes and had issue
* Lady Rachel Evelyn Russell (1826 – 21 February 1898), married Lord James Butler and had issue.

The Duchess of Bedford was a great patroness of the arts, and had a longstanding relationship with the painter Sir Edwin Landseer, a man twenty years her junior. The Bedfords&#x27; marriage was nevertheless considered to be a very happy one.

== Glen Feshie ==
In 1818, the Duke and Duchess of Bedford leased the Invereshie shootings in Badenoch from George Macpherson Grant of Ballindalloch, beginning a lifelong sporting association with Glen Feshie. The Duke built a timber shooting lodge (his &#x27;shooting box&#x27;) at Ruigh Fionntaig in the upper glen. In 1829, the Bedfords moved to the Mackintosh shootings on the east side of the glen, making the Doune House of Rothiemurchus their base. While there, the Duke&#x27;s main focuses were the breeding of livestock and the collection of botanical specimens.

==Bedford Lodge==
In 1823 the 6th Duke of Bedford was looking for a house in London and took the lease of one of the seven houses designed and built by John Tasker on Campden Hill, Kensington, for the sum of £5,250. The lodge, previously occupied by General Sir John Fraser and then a Major Colegrave, was a simple Regency villa. The Duke employed his architect Jeffry Wyatt, who had worked for him on Woburn Abbey, to enlarge the villa. After these developments were completed, for several years Bedford Lodge was valued more highly for rating purposes than Holland House. After the Duke&#x27;s death in 1839, the Dowager Duchess continued to live at Bedford Lodge and made it a famous centre for social gatherings. Duchess of Bedford&#x27;s Walk in Kensington is named in her honour. Shortly after her death in 1853, it was taken by the eighth Duke of Argyll, who renamed the house Argyll Lodge and kept it until his death in 1900.

<doc id="592151" wikidata="Q126592" url="?curid=592151" title="Even and odd functions">
<text>In mathematics, an even function is a real function such that formula_1 for every formula_2 in its domain. Similarly, an odd function is a function such that formula_3 for every formula_2 in its domain.

They are named for the parity of the powers of the power functions which satisfy each condition: the function formula_5 is even if &quot;n&quot; is an even integer, and it is odd if &quot;n&quot; is an odd integer.

Even functions are those real functions whose graph is self-symmetric with respect to the and odd functions are those whose graph is self-symmetric with respect to the origin.

If the domain of a real function is self-symmetric with respect to the origin, then the function can be uniquely decomposed as the sum of an even function and an odd function.

==Definition and examples==

Evenness and oddness are generally considered for real functions, that is real-valued functions of a real variable. However, the concepts may be more generally defined for functions whose domain and codomain both have a notion of additive inverse. This includes abelian groups, all rings, all fields, and all vector spaces. Thus, for example, a real function could be odd or even (or neither), as could a complex-valued function of a vector variable, and so on.

The given examples are real functions, to illustrate the symmetry of their graphs.

===Even functions===

A real function is even if, for every in its domain, is also in its domain and
formula_6
or equivalently
formula_7

Geometrically, the graph of an even function is symmetric with respect to the &quot;y&quot;-axis, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after reflection about the &quot;y&quot;-axis.

Examples of even functions are:
*The absolute value formula_8
*formula_9
*formula_10
*cosine formula_11
*hyperbolic cosine formula_12
*Gaussian function formula_13

===Odd functions===

A real function is odd if, for every in its domain, is also in its domain and
formula_14
or equivalently 
formula_15

Geometrically, the graph of an odd function has rotational symmetry with respect to the origin, meaning that its graph remains unchanged after rotation of 180 degrees about the origin.

If formula_16 is in the domain of an odd function formula_17, then formula_18.

Examples of odd functions are:
*The sign function formula_19
*The identity function formula_20
*formula_21
*sine formula_22
*hyperbolic sine formula_23
*The error function formula_24

==Basic properties==

===Uniqueness===
* If a function is both even and odd, it is equal to 0 everywhere it is defined.
* If a function is odd, the absolute value of that function is an even function.

===Addition and subtraction===
* The sum of two even functions is even.
* The sum of two odd functions is odd.
* The difference between two odd functions is odd.
* The difference between two even functions is even.
* The sum of an even and odd function is not even or odd, unless one of the functions is equal to zero over the given domain.

===Multiplication and division===
* The product of two even functions is an even function.
** That implies that product of any number of even functions is an even function as well.
* The product of two odd functions is an even function.
* The product of an even function and an odd function is an odd function.
* The quotient of two even functions is an even function.
* The quotient of two odd functions is an even function.
* The quotient of an even function and an odd function is an odd function.

===Composition===
* The composition of two even functions is even.
* The composition of two odd functions is odd.
* The composition of an even function and an odd function is even.
* The composition of any function with an even function is even (but not vice versa).

==Even–odd decomposition==
If a real function has a domain that is self-symmetric with respect to the origin, it may be uniquely decomposed as the sum of an even and an odd function, which are called respectively the even part (or the even component) and the odd part (or the odd component) of the function, and are defined by
formula_25
and
formula_26

It is straightforward to verify that formula_27 is even, formula_28 is odd, and formula_29

This decomposition is unique since, if
:formula_30
where is even and is odd, then formula_31 and formula_32 since
: formula_33

For example, the hyperbolic cosine and the hyperbolic sine may be regarded as the even and odd parts of the exponential function, as the first one is an even function, the second one is odd, and 
:formula_34.
Fourier&#x27;s sine and cosine transforms also perform even–odd decomposition by representing a function&#x27;s odd part with sine waves (an odd function) and the function&#x27;s even part with cosine waves (an even function).

==Further algebraic properties==
* Any linear combination of even functions is even, and the even functions form a vector space over the reals. Similarly, any linear combination of odd functions is odd, and the odd functions also form a vector space over the reals. In fact, the vector space of &quot;all&quot; real functions is the direct sum of the subspaces of even and odd functions. This is a more abstract way of expressing the property in the preceding section.
**The space of functions can be considered a graded algebra over the real numbers by this property, as well as some of those above.

*The even functions form a commutative algebra over the reals. However, the odd functions do &quot;not&quot; form an algebra over the reals, as they are not closed under multiplication.

==Analytic properties==

A function&#x27;s being odd or even does not imply differentiability, or even continuity. For example, the Dirichlet function is even, but is nowhere continuous. 

In the following, properties involving derivatives, Fourier series, Taylor series are considered, and these concepts are thus supposed to be defined for the considered functions.

===Basic analytic properties===
* The derivative of an even function is odd. 
* The derivative of an odd function is even.
* The integral of an odd function from −&quot;A&quot; to +&quot;A&quot; is zero (where &quot;A&quot; can be finite or infinite, and the function has no vertical asymptotes between −&quot;A&quot; and &quot;A&quot;). For an odd function that is integrable over a symmetric interval, e.g. formula_35, the result of the integral over that interval is zero; that is
*:formula_36.
* The integral of an even function from −&quot;A&quot; to +&quot;A&quot; is twice the integral from 0 to +&quot;A&quot; (where &quot;A&quot; is finite, and the function has no vertical asymptotes between −&quot;A&quot; and &quot;A&quot;. This also holds true when &quot;A&quot; is infinite, but only if the integral converges); that is 
*:formula_37.

===Series===
* The Maclaurin series of an even function includes only even powers.
* The Maclaurin series of an odd function includes only odd powers.
* The Fourier series of a periodic even function includes only cosine terms.
* The Fourier series of a periodic odd function includes only sine terms.
*The Fourier transform of a purely real-valued even function is real and even. (see )
*The Fourier transform of a purely real-valued odd function is imaginary and odd. (see )

==Harmonics==
In signal processing, harmonic distortion occurs when a sine wave signal is sent through a memory-less nonlinear system, that is, a system whose output at time &quot;t&quot; only depends on the input at time &quot;t&quot; and does not depend on the input at any previous times. Such a system is described by a response function formula_38. The type of harmonics produced depend on the response function &quot;f&quot;:
* When the response function is even, the resulting signal will consist of only even harmonics of the input sine wave; formula_39
** The fundamental is also an odd harmonic, so will not be present.
** A simple example is a full-wave rectifier.
** The formula_40 component represents the DC offset, due to the one-sided nature of even-symmetric transfer functions.
* When it is odd, the resulting signal will consist of only odd harmonics of the input sine wave; formula_41
** The output signal will be half-wave symmetric.
** A simple example is clipping in a symmetric push-pull amplifier.
* When it is asymmetric, the resulting signal may contain either even or odd harmonics; formula_42
** Simple examples are a half-wave rectifier, and clipping in an asymmetrical class-A amplifier.

This does not hold true for more complex waveforms. A sawtooth wave contains both even and odd harmonics, for instance. After even-symmetric full-wave rectification, it becomes a triangle wave, which, other than the DC offset, contains only odd harmonics.

==Generalizations==
===Multivariate functions===

Even symmetry:

A function formula_43 is called &quot;even symmetric&quot; if:
:formula_44

Odd symmetry:

A function formula_43 is called &quot;odd symmetric&quot; if:
:formula_46

===Complex-valued functions===
The definitions for even and odd symmetry for complex-valued functions of a real argument are similar to the real case. In signal processing, a similar symmetry is sometimes considered, which involves complex conjugation.

Conjugate symmetry:

A complex-valued function of a real argument formula_47 is called &quot;conjugate symmetric&quot; if
:formula_48

A complex valued function is conjugate symmetric if and only if its real part is an even function and its imaginary part is an odd function.

A typical example of a conjugate symmetric function is the cis function
:formula_49

Conjugate antisymmetry:

A complex-valued function of a real argument formula_47 is called &quot;conjugate antisymmetric&quot; if:
:formula_51

A complex valued function is conjugate antisymmetric if and only if its real part is an odd function and its imaginary part is an even function.

===Finite length sequences===
The definitions of odd and even symmetry are extended to &quot;N&quot;-point sequences (i.e. functions of the form formula_52) as follows:

Even symmetry:

A &quot;N&quot;-point sequence is called &quot;conjugate symmetric&quot; if
:formula_53

Such a sequence is often called a palindromic sequence; see also Palindromic polynomial.

Odd symmetry:

A &quot;N&quot;-point sequence is called &quot;conjugate antisymmetric&quot; if
:formula_54
Such a sequence is sometimes called an anti-palindromic sequence; see also Antipalindromic polynomial.

<text>Jean Richepin (; 4 February 1849 – 12 December 1926) was a French poet, novelist and dramatist.

==Biography==
Born on February 4, 1849 at Médéa, French Algeria, Jean Richepin was the son of an army doctor.

At school and at the École Normale Supérieure he gave evidence of brilliant, if somewhat undisciplined, powers, for which he found physical vent in different directions—first as a franc-tireur in the Franco-German War, and afterwards as actor, sailor and stevedore—and an intellectual outlet in the writing of poems, plays and novels which vividly reflected his erratic but unmistakable talent. A play, &quot;L&#x27;Étoile&quot;, written by him in collaboration with André Gill (1840–1885), was produced in 1873; but Richepin was virtually unknown until the publication, in 1876, of a volume of verse entitled &quot;La Chanson des gueux&quot;, a declaration of war against the bourgeoisie, according to : Richepin&#x27;s outspokenness resulted in his being imprisoned and fined for &quot;outrage aux mœurs&quot;. The collection was republished, without the contentious pieces, which were published separately in Brussels in 1881.

The same quality characterized his succeeding volumes of verse: &quot;Les Caresses&quot; (1877), &quot;Les Blasphèmes&quot; (1884), &quot;La Mer&quot; (1886), &quot;Mes paradis&quot; (1894), &quot;La Bombarde&quot; (1899). His novels have developed in style from the morbidity and brutality of &quot;Les morts bizarres&quot; (1876), &quot;La Glu&quot; (1881) and &quot;Le Pavé&quot; (1883) to the more thoughtful psychology of &quot;Madame André&quot; (1878), &quot;Sophie Monnier&quot; (1884), &quot;Cisarine&quot; (1888), &quot;L&#x27;Aîné&quot; (1893), &quot;Grandes amoureuses&quot; (1896) and &quot;La Gibasse&quot; (1899), and the more simple portrayal of life in &quot;Miarka&quot; (1883), &quot;Les Braves Gens&quot; (1886), &quot;Truandailles&quot; (1890), &quot;La Miseloque&quot; (1892) and &quot;Flamboche&quot; (1895).
His plays, though occasionally marred by his characteristic propensity for dramatic violence of thought and language, constitute in many respects his best work. Most of these were produced at the &quot;Comédie française&quot;. During the 1880s he had an affair with Sarah Bernhardt, the greatest actress of the time.

Richepin and Arthur Rimbaud met in 1871 and seem to have formed a friendly relationship : it is through him, in any case, that the manuscripts of &quot;Fêtes de la patience&quot; (including notably &#x27;Chanson de la plus haute Tour&#x27;) have reached us. Also, Richepin was one of only &quot;seven known recipients&quot; of the first edition of &quot;A Season in Hell&quot;. They remained in correspondence at least until 1874. 

On 14 June 1913 a banquet, the &quot;Ligue des Gourmands, Xeme Diner d’Epicure&quot; was held at the Hyde Park Hotel in London. The menu was designed and a toast given by August Escoffier, the league&#x27;s founder and at the time co-president with Richepin.

Richepin won three prizes awarded by the Académie française: the for the best comedy in verse or prose performed at the Théâtre Français during the previous year), in 1893, for&quot; Par le glaive&quot;, and again, in 1906, for &quot;Don Quichotte&quot;. He also won the (awarded to the author of a dramatic work), in 1899, for &quot;Le Chemineau&quot;. He was elected to the Académie française on March 5, 1908. He was also Commander of the Legion of Honour.

A commemorative plaque pays tribute to him at 85, rue de la Tour, Paris, on the façade of the building where he died.

His son was also a dramatist ; one of Jean Richepin&#x27;s favourite composers, Xavier Leroux, composed incidental music for Jacques Richepin&#x27;s comedy &quot;Xantho chez les courtisanes&quot;. His other son, , a composer of operettas and film music.

In an interview recorded in 1942 Tiarko said: &quot;My grandfather, Jules Richepin, was a military doctor. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t know him very well. My grandmother followed her husband to the garrisons, so it was by chance that my father was born in Médéa, Algeria. Let&#x27;s delve a little deeper into the past. My father was an extraordinary storyteller. He had the whole of Paris and many foreigners flocking to his famous Annales lectures. He was received with great respect in the courts of Europe. He was friends with Queen Elisabeth of Romania, also known as Carmen Sylva. He admired her poetry and visited her often. Returning from his lecture tours, he would bring back decorations, modestly stored in a trunk, because my father was simplicity itself. He spoke verse admirably, like a professional actor. In 1884 [In fact 1883], he performed her drama, Nana-Sahib, alongside the legendary Sarah Bernhardt. With a prodigious memory, he could recite thousands of verses by heart. Later, the French Academy opened its doors wide to him.&quot; (RTF, 1942)

Tiarko is perhaps overly eulogistic—cultivating a legend seems to be a trait he shares with his father, though his father crafted the legend around himself. He spread self-serving rumours after he was expelled from the École normale supérieure, probably for cheating. One rumour claimed he had been caught one night in the chapel of the École normale, in the company of three women. This fabricated achievement was intended to obscure his real fault. A second rumour suggested that the day after his expulsion, he set up a stall opposite the École normale supérieure, selling chestnuts - or possibly chips - and displayed a sign reading : ‘Jean Richepin, former student of the École normale, chestnut seller’) . This was another lie designed to undermine those who expelled him and mock them. He later used manipulative lies to draw attention to himself and gain fame (for want of being recognized as a great writer), particularly when he was about to publish a new book.
The newspapers sometimes criticized him severely :
‘As soon as the news of Jean Richepin&#x27;s madness broke along the boulevard, everyone exclaimed with a smile: ‘This Richepin, what a clever fellow!’ It never occurred to anyone — even those unfamiliar with his cold, calculating nature — that M. Richepin might really be mad ; on the contrary, everyone thought that it was M. Richepin himself who, with the complaisance of a friend — the poet Ponchon, perhaps — who was spreading the rumour of his sudden madness through the cafés. People especially admired the ingenious staging, completely new, which seemed to have been planned by M. Duquesnel, of this gripping drama: the Trappists refusing to open the door of their cloister to the author of ‘’Blasphèmes’’, the unhappy wife setting off in pursuit of the desperate man, and the latter, filth on his body, revolt in his soul, sinking into the desert, the mysterious desert from which no one has returned, and where he was already represented to us, loved by panthers, taming lions and raising up wandering peoples. ’ (First paragraph of a long and delightful article by Octave Mirbeau published on the front page of the newspaper Le Gaulois, 8 December 1884
Justine Richard suspects that this lie was invented in collaboration with Sarah Bernhardt, whom the actor Paul Mounet introduced to Richepin in 1882, and who became her lover.

==Richepin and composers==
Richepin adapted a libretto from his 1883 novel &quot;Miarka la fille à l&#x27;ours&quot; for Alexandre Georges&#x27; opera &quot;Miarka&quot; (Paris, 1905), and &quot;Le mage&quot; (1891) for the music of Jules Massenet (Paris, 1891). &quot;Le Flibustier&quot; was made into an opera by César Cui (1888). Richepin adapted from his play &quot;Le Chemineau&quot; a libretto for &quot;&quot;, a lyric drama composed by Xavier Leroux, and premiered in Paris in 1907. Also for Leroux, he wrote the libretto for &quot;Le Carillonneur&quot;, based on the novel by Georges Rodenbach (Opéra-Comique, March 20, 1913. Still for the same composer, he composed the libretto for &quot;La plus forte&quot; in collaboration with Paul de Choudens. The ballet &quot;L&#x27;Impératrice&quot; by Paul Vidal is based on a text by Richepin (Paris, 1901) who also wrote the lyrics for his friend Emmanuel Chabrier&#x27;s concert &quot;scène lyrique&quot; &quot;La Sulamite&quot; and helped with the libretto of Le roi malgré lui. His novel &quot;La Glu&quot; was the basis for two other operas, one by Gabriel Dupont (1910) and one by Camille Erlanger. Another work he collaborated on is &quot;Soléa&quot;, a lyric drama in four acts and five tableaux, with poetry and music by Isidore de Lara, versified into French by Jean Richepin (Cologne, December 19, 1907). Composer Dagmar de Corval Rybner used Richepin’s text for her song &quot;Te Souvient-il&quot;. &quot;Mam&#x27;selle Napoléon&quot; is a musical comedy by Joseph W. Herbert based on a play by Jean Richepin, with music by Gustav Luders, which opened at the Knickerbocker Theater in New York, 8 December 1903, starring Ann Held.

There are over 100 poems by Jean Richepin which have inspired a large number of musicians. Forty poems from &quot;Les Caresses&quot; attracted the attention of composers such as César Cui, Gabriel Dupont, Louis Vierne, Auguste Chapuis, Alfred Bruneau, Camille Erlanger, Nikolay Sokolov, Paul Hillemacher and his brother, Georges Hüe, André Messager, Florent Schmitt, Paul Puget, , (&#x27;Du mouron pour les p&#x27;tits oiseaux&#x27;) and Ernest Moret. &#x27;Le bateau rose&#x27; was his most popular poem with composers, set to music more than ten times, including by Paul Lacôme : the song was titled &#x27;Je m&#x27;embarquerai, si tu le veux&#x27; (Lacôme also set &quot;Vieilles amourettes&quot; as &quot;Aux prés de l&#x27;enfance on cueille&quot;) There are several translations of &#x27; Où vivre ? Dans quelle ombre ?&#x27; that have been set to music : one in Italian for Casella, and two translations in Russian, one for Cui and the other one (Где жить?) for Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, for his opus 22.

Over 20 poems from &quot;La Mer&quot; garnered significant interest, particularly for &quot;Larmes&quot; (Pleurons nos chagrins, chacun le nôtre) with 8 different settings, including those by Marie Jaëll, André Caplet, , Cui, Fauré, Alfredo Casella. 

Sixteen poems from &quot;La chanson des gueux&quot; have been the sources for melodies by Désiré Dihau, Cui, Marguerite Roesgen-Champion, etc. &quot;Miarka la fille à l&#x27;ours&quot; particularly inspired Alexandre Georges, while also inspiring two works by Ernest Chausson or Arthur Honegger, and one by Frederick Delius. 

Only two poems from &quot;La bombarde, contes à chanter&quot; have retained the attention of composers : &#x27;Trois petits oiseaux dans les blés&#x27; (Gabriel Pierné, Marcel Samuel-Rousseau) and &#x27;Les deux ménétriers&#x27; (Cécile Chaminade, Cui, Robert Dussaut - as well as Edith Piaf). There are also six settings of &#x27;La Chanson de la Glu&#x27; (Y avait un&#x27; fois un pauv&#x27; gas) from the novel &quot;La Glu&quot; (Auguste Chapuis, Georges Fragerolle, Charles Gounod, Joseph Jongen, and others), two poems from &quot;Par le Glaive&quot;, one set by Ethelbert Nevin and the other one by Richepin himself (who also composed music for &#x27;Les trois bateaux&#x27; from &quot;Les Truands&quot;). Louis Vierne composed on &#x27;Les roses blanches de la lune&#x27; (from &quot;Les Glas, Poèmes&quot;) ; Max Arham and Ange Flégier on &#x27;La requête aux étoiles&#x27; and César Cui and Ernest Moret on &#x27;Si mon rival&#x27; (all three poems from &quot;Les Blasphèmes&quot;, as well as &#x27;Le Hun&#x27; by (Chœurs sans accompagnement, op. 37), and Alfred Bruneau on &#x27; Ohé! la belle, en vous levant&#x27; (from &quot;Interludes&quot;). One poem from &quot;Mes Paradis&quot; was also set to music. composed the melody &#x27;Rêve !&#x27; on a poem by Richepin. 

More recently, &#x27;Les deux ménétriers&#x27; was sung by Damia, Line Marsa as well as Piaf. Singer-songwriter Georges Brassens sang two poems from &quot;La Chanson des gueux&quot; : &#x27;Les oiseaux de passage&#x27; and &#x27;Philistins&#x27; (Richepin&#x27;s title was &#x27;Chanson des cloches de Baptême&#x27;). has released a double CD-book, &quot; Même pas foutus d&#x27;être heureux &quot;: the second CD contains 15 songs based on poems by Richepin taken from &quot;La Chanson des Gueux&quot;, &quot;Mes Paradis&quot;, &quot;La Mer&quot;... - and one by his friend Raoul Ponchon : &#x27;Vive l’eau&#x27;, from &quot;La Muse au cabaret&quot;.

<text>William Arnold Ridley (7 January 1896 – 12 March 1984) was an English playwright and actor, known early in his career for writing the 1925 play &quot;The Ghost Train&quot; and later in life for the British television sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; (1968–77), in which he played the elderly, bumbling Private Godfrey. He also appeared in such &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; spin-offs as the feature film version and the stage production.

==Early life==

William Arnold Ridley was born in Walcot, Bath, Somerset, England, the son of Rosa Caroline (née Morrish, 1870–1956) and William Robert Ridley (1871–1931). His father was a gymnastics instructor and ran a boot and shoe shop. He attended the Clarendon School and the Bath City Secondary School where he was a keen sportsman. A graduate of the University of Bristol, he studied at the Education Department, and played Hamlet in a student production. Ridley undertook teaching practice at an Elementary School in Bristol.

==Military service==

Ridley was a student teacher and had made his theatrical debut in &quot;Prunella&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Bristol when he volunteered for service with the British Army on the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. He was initially rejected because of a hammer toe. In December 1915, he enlisted as a private with the Somerset Light Infantry, British Army. He saw active service in the war, sustaining several wounds in close-quarter battle. His left hand was left virtually useless by wounds sustained on the Somme; his legs were riddled with shrapnel; he received a bayonet wound in the groin; and the legacy of a blow to the head from a German soldier&#x27;s rifle butt left him prone to blackouts after the war. He was medically discharged from the army with the rank of lance corporal in May 1917. He received the Silver War Badge having been honourably discharged from the army due to wounds received in the war, and was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal for his service.

Ridley rejoined the army in 1939 following the outbreak of the Second World War. He was commissioned into the General List on 7 October 1939 as a second lieutenant. He served with the British Expeditionary Force in France during the &quot;Phoney War&quot;, employed as a &quot;Conducting Officer&quot; tasked with supervising journalists who were visiting the front line. In May 1940, Ridley returned to Britain on the overcrowded destroyer HMS &quot;Vimiera&quot;, which was the last British ship to escape from the harbour during the Battle of Boulogne. Shortly afterwards, he was discharged from the Armed Forces on health grounds. He relinquished his commission as a captain on 1 June 1940. He subsequently joined the Home Guard, in his home town of Caterham, and ENSA, with which he toured the country. He described his wartime experiences on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1973.

==Acting career==

After his medical discharge from the army in 1916, Ridley commenced a career as a professional actor. In 1918 he joined the company of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, staying for two years and playing 40 parts before moving on to Plymouth, where he took a break from the stage when his war injuries began to trouble him.

After being stranded for an evening at Mangotsfield railway station, near Bristol, Ridley was inspired to write the play &quot;The Ghost Train&quot; (1925), a tale of passengers stranded at a haunted railway station in Cornwall, with one of the characters being an incognito British Government agent trying to catch Bolshevik revolutionaries active in Great Britain. The play became a hit, with 665 consecutive performances in London&#x27;s West End, and numerous revivals. The first credited film version was a German-British silent film, &quot;The Ghost Train&quot;, in 1927. &quot;The Ghost Train&quot; was also filmed in 1931, with Jack Hulbert, and again in 1941, when it starred Arthur Askey. Ridley also wrote more than 30 other plays, including &quot;The Wrecker&quot; (1924), &quot;Keepers of Youth&quot; (1929), &quot;The Flying Fool&quot; (1929) and &quot;Recipe for Murder&quot; (1932).

During his time in military service in the Second World War he adapted the Agatha Christie novel &quot;Peril at End House&quot; into a West End play that premiered in 1940. Ridley&#x27;s post-war play, &quot;Beggar My Neighbour&quot;, was first performed in 1951 and adapted for the Ealing Comedy film &quot;Meet Mr. Lucifer&quot; (1953).

Ridley worked regularly as an actor, including an appearance in the British comedy &quot;Crooks in Cloisters&quot; (1964). He also played Doughy Hood, the village baker, in the radio soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot; and the Rev. Guy Atkins in the ATV soap &quot;Crossroads&quot; from the programme&#x27;s inception in 1964 until 1968. However, he became a household name only after he was cast as Private Godfrey, the gentle platoon medic in the television comedy series &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; (1968–1977). He continued to appear into his eighties, and was appointed an OBE in the 1982 Queen&#x27;s New Year Honours List, for services to the theatre.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1976 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at London&#x27;s Marylebone Station.

==Personal life==

Ridley was married three times. His first marriage lasted from January 1926 to 1939, and was followed by a short marriage to Isola Strong, an actress (&quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Be Good&quot;), at Kensington in 1939, before his final marriage to actress Althea Parker (1911–2001) on 3 October 1945; they had one son, Nicolas (b. 1947). He was a Freemason, and belonged to the Savage Club Lodge in London. The actress Daisy Ridley is his great-niece.

A keen rugby player in his youth, he was President of Bath Rugby from 1950 to 1952.

==Death==

Ridley died in hospital in Northwood in 1984 at the age of 88 after falling at his residence in Denville Hall, a home for retired actors. His body was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium and an urn holding his ashes was buried in his parents&#x27; grave at Bath Abbey Cemetery. His collection of theatrical memorabilia was left to the University of Bristol and has been made available online.

<text>Kay Starr (born Catherine Laverne Starks; July 21, 1922 – November 3, 2016) was an American singer who enjoyed considerable success in the late 1940s and 1950s. She was of Iroquois and Irish heritage. Starr performed multiple genres, such as pop, jazz, and country, but her roots were in jazz.

==Early life==
Catherine Laverne Starks was born in Dougherty, Oklahoma to Annie and Harry Starks. Her mother&#x27;s ancestors were Irish-American while her father was a Native American Iroquois. She would later claim to be both Cherokee and Choctaw descent. At the age of three, the Starks family moved to Dallas, Texas, where her father obtained a job installing building sprinklers. Her mother raised chickens to support the family as well. Catherine began singing during early childhood, often performing to the chickens that her mother was raising. She sang frequently around the house which caught the attention of her aunt, with whose help she took part in a local talent contest and won at the age of seven.

== Career ==

Young Catherine continued to enter talent contests, and eventually landed a spot performing on Dallas&#x27;s WRR radio station. She performed two times a week and earned three dollars a performance. The Starks family moved to Memphis, Tennessee when she was 15 and was given her own &quot;Starr Segment&quot; on Memphis&#x27;s WREC station. Due to many people incorrectly saying her last name, she adapted the stage name of &quot;Kay Starr&quot;. During high school, she worked with various country music bands. She was discovered by jazz violinist Joe Venuti, who had obtained a contract to perform at the Peabody Hotel in the summer of 1937. Starr&#x27;s parents accepted the performance opportunity, as long as she was home by their midnight curfew. Venuti did not tell the hotel her real age, and fibbed about Starr&#x27;s mother being her sister. For the next two summers, Starr performed alongside Venuti.

Starr&#x27;s singing attracted the attention of Bob Crosby&#x27;s manager and had her join Crosby on the road. She went to New York City and played with Crosby&#x27;s band for two weeks until she was dismissed by the show&#x27;s sponsor for being considered &quot;too earthy&quot;. Despite being let go, she caught the attention of Glenn Miller, who needed a substitute female performer while his regular performer (Marion Hutton) was ill. For two weeks, Starr performed at the Glen Island Casino alongside Miller&#x27;s orchestra. At age 16, Starr recorded her first tracks with Miller&#x27;s orchestra: &quot;Baby Me&quot; and &quot;Love with a Capital &#x27;You&#x27;&quot;. The songs failed to become a success. This was in part because the band played in a key that, while appropriate for Hutton, did not suit Kay. Starr later recalled that she sounded like &quot;a jazzed up Alfalfa&quot; since they weren&#x27;t in her range.

Starr and her mother then returned to Memphis, where she completed high school in 1940. She then moved to Los Angeles and worked alongside Venuti until 1941.

Starr then signed with Wingy Manone&#x27;s band. From 1943 to 1945 she sang with Charlie Barnet&#x27;s ensemble, retiring for a year after contracting pneumonia and later developing nodes on her vocal cords as a result of fatigue and overwork. In 1946 Starr became a soloist and a year later signed a contract with Capitol Records. The label had a number of female singers signed up, including Peggy Lee, Ella Mae Morse, Jo Stafford, and Margaret Whiting, so it was hard to find her a niche of her own. In 1948 when the American Federation of Musicians was threatening a strike, Capitol wanted to have each of its singers record a back list for future release. Being junior to all these other artists meant that every song Starr wanted to sing was taken by her rivals on the label, leaving her a list of old songs which nobody else wanted to record.
In 1950, she returned home to Dougherty and heard a fiddle recording of &quot;Bonaparte&#x27;s Retreat&quot; by Pee Wee King. She liked it so much that she wanted to record it. She contacted Roy Acuff&#x27;s publishing house in Nashville and spoke to Acuff directly. He was happy to let her record it, but it took a while for her to make clear that she was a singer, not a fiddler, and therefore needed to have some lyrics written. Acuff came up with a new lyric, and &quot;Bonaparte&#x27;s Retreat&quot; became her biggest hit up to that point, with close to a million sales.

In 1955, she signed with RCA Victor Records. However, at this time, rock-and-roll was displacing the existing forms of pop music and Kay had only two hits, the aforementioned, which is sometimes considered her attempt to sing rock and roll, and sometimes as a song poking fun at it, &quot;The Rock and Roll Waltz&quot;. She stayed at RCA Victor until 1959, hitting the top ten with &quot;My Heart Reminds Me&quot;, then returned to Capitol.

Most of Starr&#x27;s songs had jazz influences. Like those of Frankie Laine and Johnnie Ray, they were sung in a style that anticipated rock and roll songs. These included her hits &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (her biggest hit, No. 1 for 10 weeks), &quot;Side by Side&quot;, &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll Waltz&quot;. One of her biggest hits was her version of &quot;(Everybody&#x27;s Waitin&#x27; For) The Man with the Bag&quot;, a Christmas song that became a holiday favorite.

After rock-and-roll swept established performers from the charts, Starr appeared in the television series &quot;Club Oasis&quot;, mostly associated with the bandleader Spike Jones. She recorded several albums, including &quot;Movin&quot;&#x27; (1959), &quot;Losers, Weepers…&quot; (1960), &quot;I Cry By Night&quot; (1962), and &quot;Just Plain Country&quot; (1962).

After leaving Capitol for a second time in 1966, Starr continued touring in the US and the UK. She recorded several jazz and country albums on small independent labels, including &quot;How About This&quot;, a 1968 album with Count Basie.

In the late 1980s she performed in the revue &quot;3 Girls&quot; with Helen O&#x27;Connell and Margaret Whiting, and in 1993 she toured the United Kingdom as part of Pat Boone&#x27;s &quot;April Love&quot; Tour. Her first live album, &quot;Live at Freddy&#x27;s&quot;, was released in 1997. She sang with Tony Bennett on his album &quot;Playin&#x27; with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues&quot; (2001).

==Death==
Starr died on November 3, 2016, in Los Angeles at the age of 94 from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Starr was married six times, including, briefly in 1953, to bandleader/composer Vic Schoen. Starr was survived by a daughter.

<text>Thorah Island is a lake island located in the southeast portion of Lake Simcoe, approximately west from Beaverton in Ontario, Canada. The island, part of Brock Township, is approximately 1,450 acres (6 km2) in size and the land is divided mainly between wooded and wooded-swamp terrain. Some land has been cleared for farming and recreational purposes but much of the agricultural land has fallen into disuse and has grown over. Centre Road runs from the east side of the island to the west side but is not much more than a dirt path. A small harbour exists on the east side of the island, directly across from Beaverton Harbour. There are several sandy beaches on the west side of the island, but most of the island&#x27;s shore is rocky.

Thorah as well as three other islands in Lake Simcoe were ceded by the Chippewa Indians in 1856 to the British Crown on the agreement that the land would be sold and the proceeds invested for the descendants of the ceding chiefs. Following this sale William Napier made the first survey of the island in 1856.

Thorah was originally used as a recreational destination in the late nineteenth century by a group of four businessmen from Toronto who came to the island to camp and fish. The island currently (2005) has a seasonal population of 147 that include several descendants of the original group.

Today the island is used by the Honey Bee Research Centre at the University of Guelph as an isolated mating station for the Buckfast Bee lines maintained by the research centre.

The island was also named Canise (or Kanise) Island by Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1793 to honour a local native chief by that name. In the above-mentioned treaty between the natives and the British the island is known as Plum Island. Neither of these names is in popular use today.

<text>Roch-Ambroise Cucurron Sicard (; 20 September 1742 – 10 May 1822) was a French abbé and instructor of the deaf.

Born at Le Fousseret, in the ancient Province of Languedoc (now the Department of Haute-Garonne), and educated as a priest, Sicard was made principal of a school for the deaf at Bordeaux in 1786, and in 1789, on the death of the Abbé de l&#x27;Épée, succeeded him at a leading school for the deaf which Épée had founded in Paris. He later met Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet while traveling in England, and invited him to visit the school.

Sicard&#x27;s chief works were his &quot;Eléments de grammaire générale&quot; (1799), &quot;Cours d&#x27;instruction d&#x27;un sourd-muet de naissance&quot; (1800) and &quot;Traité des signes pour l&#x27;instruction des sourds-muets&quot; (1808). The Abbé Sicard managed to escape any serious harm in the political troubles of 1792, and became a member of the Institute in 1795, but the value of his educational work was hardly recognized till shortly before his death at Paris.

In 1803 Sicard became a member of the Académie française, occupying Seat 3 as the successor to the François-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis, who was a diplomat.

<text>A trackless train — or tram (U.S. English), road train, land train, or parking lot train is a road-going articulated vehicle used for the transport of passengers, comprising a driving vehicle pulling one or more carriages connected by drawbar couplings, in the manner of a road-going railway train.
Similar vehicles may be used for transport of freight or baggage for short distances, such as at a factory or airport. Often depending on use, land train may or may not be skeuomorphically styled to look like traditional, often steam trains.

==Terminology==
&quot;Trackless train&quot; or &quot;land train&quot; are descriptive terms for the rubber tired road-going vehicles to distinguish them from rail mounted trains. &quot;Parking lot tram&quot; is a common name in the US, reflecting its use in parking lot transport.

The lack of a widely accepted generic name for trackless trains often leads to them being called trams, people movers or road trains. Due to cultural terminology differences, &quot;trackless train&quot;, &quot;tram&quot; and &quot;parking lot tram&quot; usages occur in North America, while &quot;land train&quot; and &quot;road train&quot; are used in Europe.

==Technology==

A trackless train usually consists of a tractor unit pulling a number of articulated trailers or carriages in the manner of a locomotive-hauled railway train. The tractor unit can be powered by an internal combustion engine or an electric motor.

Carriages may seat between 6 and 40 persons, and can be roofed or not, featuring open or closed sides and various levels of interior comfort such as padded seats. If open, depending on climate they may feature plastic or fiberglass corrugated panels overhead, to divert rain and provide some measure of shade. Alternative designs may use a cloth awning overhead for similar purposes.

Carriages usually contain latchable doors or chains to act as safety measures to prevent exit while in motion. Carriages and tractor false bodies are constructed in either fiberglass or aluminum, and may feature levelling suspension.

As in a regular road vehicle, the tractor unit is steered through the front wheels by a steering wheel operated by a human driver, and powered by its rear single or double axle. The following carriages are then steered through the drawbar couplings between the carriages. Simple trains with few carriages or short in overall length may feature single- or double-axle carriages with just front-axle steering only. Larger or longer trains feature four-wheel steering by way of mechanical linkages. Four-wheel steering ensures that longer trains need less side clearance while turning, as the carriages are able to maintain the same path, describing a constant radius of arc. This adds to the impression of the vehicle being on rails. The drawbar connections of more complex trains may feature a shock absorber to mitigate the effect of acceleration or braking.

==Public uses==

Trackless trains are often used for the transport of tourists instead of other public transport modes. These may be seasonal services, linking attractions such as museums and zoos or other tourist destinations with central areas. Often, the train ride itself is a tourist attraction, offering sightseeing along scenic routes as well as a transport service. In the Swiss town of Gruyères, a trackless train is the only vehicle allowed in the pedestrianized streets. A similar train is also used to move students between the train station and the faculties in the Outer Alcalá de Henares University Campus.

Trackless trains are also used in shopping malls to entertain children while their parents are shopping. Trackless trains used for this purpose are commonly smaller and have less power.

A larger and faster form of trackless tram is the rubber-tyred tram used as a public transport alternative to conventional light rail, tram and bus.

In some countries in Europe a Volkswagen minibus usually carries 3 carriages, these trackless trains can often carry only 38 passengers.

==Private/Theme Park uses==
Trackless trains are also often operated for the exclusive use of customers of resorts or amusement parks, both as internal transport systems entirely within their premises either from parking areas and between attractions, or as rides in themselves. A particularly heavy user of trackless trains has been the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts where they are used to move guests between the outlying parking lots and the park entrances. 16 trams reside at Disneyland Resort, and 28 trams reside at Walt Disney World Resort. Universal, and other movie studio theme parks also use trackless trains on their studio backlot tours. Purdue University has the Boilermaker Special as its mascot.

==Appearance==
While some trackless trains are functional or modern in appearance, many are often constructed with false bodywork and are painted to look like nineteenth century steam locomotives. Others may feature decorative or fun paint schemes to appeal to children. Certain models of trackless train may look the same as narrow-gauge rail guided amusement park trains, due to the common manufacture of both vehicles. Some fifth wheel coupled trailer buses may also be similarly decorated.

==Airport baggage trains==
Mechanized baggage trains−trams, used at airport terminals, have steering mechanisms similar to those on longer trackless trains, although the tractor units are commonly designed to be frequently detached from the baggage carts, to be used for other purposes. Individual baggage carts are also quickly detachable for parking in loading−unloading areas. Airport baggage trains are often also much longer than the passenger type.

<text>In stellar evolution, an FU Orionis star (also FU Orionis object, or &quot;FUor&quot;) is a pre–main-sequence star which displays an extreme change in magnitude and spectral type. One example is the star V1057 Cyg, which became six magnitudes brighter and went from spectral type dKe to F-type supergiant during 1969-1970. These stars are named after their type-star, FU Orionis.
The current model developed primarily by Lee Hartmann and Scott Jay Kenyon associates the FU Orionis flare with abrupt mass transfer from an accretion disc onto a young, low mass T Tauri star. Mass accretion rates for these objects are estimated to be around 10−4 solar masses per year. The rise time of these eruptions is typically on the order of 1 year, but can be much longer. The lifetime of this high-accretion, high-luminosity phase is on the order of decades. However, even with such a relatively short timespan, no FU Orionis object had been observed shutting off. By comparing the number of FUor outbursts to the rate of star formation in the solar neighborhood, it is estimated that the average young star undergoes approximately 10–20 FUor eruptions over its lifetime.

The spectra of FU Orionis stars are dominated by absorption features produced in the inner accretion disc. The spectrum of the inner part produce a spectrum of a F-G supergiant, while the outer parts and slightly colder parts of the disk produce a K-M type supergiant spectrum that can be observed in the near-infrared. In FU Orionis stars the disk radiation dominates, which can be used to study the inner parts of the disk.

The prototypes of this class are: FU Orionis, V1057 Cygni, V1515 Cygni, and the embedded protostar V1647 Orionis, which erupted in January 2004.

<text>Simeon Bekbulatovich (; born Sain-Bulat; ; died ) was a Russian statesman of Tatar origin who briefly served as the figurehead ruler of Russia from 1575 to 1576. He was a descendant of Genghis Khan.

He was born into a Muslim family and served as the khan of the Khanate of Qasim before converting to Christianity and becoming an aide to Ivan IV of Russia. He participated in the Livonian War as a commander of the main regiment (&quot;bolshoy polk&quot;) of the Russian army. In 1575, Ivan made Simeon the grand prince of all Russia, though Ivan remained the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler and returned to his throne a year later. Subsequently, Simeon became the grand prince of Tver and Torzhok (1576–1585). He went blind (or was blinded) in 1595 and was allegedly tonsured as a Christian monk under the monastic name Stefan in 1606.

==Biography==
Simeon was the son of Bek-Bulat, and a great-grandson of Ahmed Khan bin Küchük.
The first mention of Simeon is in the &quot;Supplement to the Nikon Chronicle&quot; in 1561 when he came to Moscow in the entourage of his aunt, Kochenei (baptized as Maria), when she married Ivan IV that year. The earliest evidence he was the khan of Qasim comes from a statement from the Russian ambassador to Constantinople, Ivan Novosiltsev, to the Ottoman sultan Selim II in 1570.

In 1575 (either September or October), Ivan IV appointed Simeon as the grand prince of all Russia, and styled himself merely as &quot;Ivan of Moscow&quot;. Historians have a number of opinions concerning why Ivan did this. According to the most popular theory by contemporary diplomat Giles Fletcher, the Elder, Ivan aimed to confiscate the land that belonged to monasteries without attracting the ire of the Church. Simeon issued the decrees of confiscation instead of Ivan, while Ivan pretended to disagree. During his one-year &quot;rule&quot; in the Moscow Kremlin, Simeon married Anastasia Mstislavskaya, the great-great-granddaughter of Ivan III.

In September 1576, Simeon stepped down as the grand prince of all Russia as Ivan returned to the throne, and was given the title of grand prince of Tver and Torzhok. In 1585, Tsar Feodor Ivanovich removed his title as grand prince of Tver and Torzhok, and confined him to his estate at Kushalov. In 1595, Simeon went blind. According to Jacques Margeret, Simeon blamed Spanish wine that Boris Godunov sent him for his birthday. When Boris was elected tsar in 1598, he required those at the court to sign a loyalty oath, which prohibited them from recognizing Simeon as tsar or corresponding with him. False Dmitry I required Simeon to be tonsured at the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, where he took the monastic name Stefan on April 3, 1606. When Vasilii Shuiskii was elected tsar, he ordered the elder Stefan taken to the Solovki Monastery on May 29, 1606.

In 1612, as the result of a decree issued by Prince Dmitry Pozharsky and &quot;on the advice of all the land&quot; (Zemsky Sobor), Stefan was returned to the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery. Under Tsar Mikhail Fedorovich, he returned to Moscow and resided in the Simonov Monastery until he died in 1616. He was buried in the Simonov Monastery next to his wife, who had died June 7, 1607, after having been veiled as the nun Alexandra.

<text>Charadrius is a genus of plovers, a group of wading birds. The genus name &quot;Charadrius&quot; is a Late Latin word for a yellowish bird mentioned in the fourth-century Vulgate.
They are found throughout the world.

Many &quot;Charadrius&quot; species are characterised by breast bands or collars. These can be (in the adult) single complete bands (ringed, semipalmated, little ringed, long-billed),or double or triple bands (killdeer, three-banded, Forbes&#x27;).

They have relatively short bills and feed mainly on insects, worms or other invertebrates, depending on habitat, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups. They hunt by sight, rather than by feel as do longer-billed waders like snipe.

Species of the genera &quot;Aegialites&quot; (or &quot;Aegialitis&quot;), &quot;Thinornis&quot;, and &quot;Elseyornis&quot; are now subsumed within &quot;Charadrius&quot;. The former genus name &quot;Thinornis&quot; combined the Ancient Greek &quot;this&quot; meaning &quot;beach&quot; or &quot;sand&quot; with &quot;ornis&quot; meaning &quot;bird&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Charadrius&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The name had been used (as &quot;Charadrios sive Hiaticula&quot;) by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603 for the common ringed plover. The word is Late Latin and is mentioned in the Vulgate Bible. It derives from the Ancient Greek χαραδριος&quot;/kharadrios&quot;, an unidentified plain-coloured nocturnal bird that was found in ravines and river valleys (from &quot;kharadra&quot;, &quot;ravine&quot;). The type species is the common ringed plover. However, it once appeared that the taxonomy of “&quot;Charadrius&quot;” was erroneous, as for example the Kentish plover is more closely related to lapwings than it is to, say, the greater ringed plover. Hence, either all members of Charadriidae, excluding &quot;Pluvialis&quot; are grouped in a single genus, &quot;Charadrius&quot;, or the genus is reduced to the Common ringed plover, Piping plover, Semipalmated plover, and Killdeer. The latter option was chosen.

===Species===
The genus originally contained 33 species. However, in December 2023, The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union incorporated all species under &quot;Thinornis&quot; and &quot;Elseyornis&quot; into &quot;Charadrius&quot;, and some species of &quot;Charadrius&quot; are now placed in the genus &quot;Anarhynchus&quot;. As a result, &quot;Charadrius&quot; now consists of only 11 species:

* Killdeer &quot;Charadrius vociferus&quot; 
* Common ringed plover &quot;Charadrius hiaticula&quot; 
* Semipalmated plover &quot;Charadrius semipalmatus&quot; 
* Piping plover &quot;Charadrius melodus&quot; 
* Hooded plover &quot;Charadrius cucullatus&quot; 
* Forbes&#x27;s plover &quot;Charadrius forbesi&quot; 
* Three-banded plover &quot;Charadrius tricollaris&quot; 
* Black-fronted dotterel &quot;Charadrius melanops&quot; 
* Shore plover &quot;Charadrius novaeseelandiae&quot; 
* Little ringed plover &quot;Charadrius dubius&quot; 
* Long-billed plover &quot;Charadrius placidus&quot; 
Another species, the Auckland Islands shore plover (&quot;Charadrius&quot; (&quot;Thinornis&quot;) &quot;rossii&quot;), known from just one specimen collected in 1840, is now generally considered to be a juvenile shore plover whose location was incorrectly recorded.

<doc id="592189" wikidata="Q11120689" url="?curid=592189" title="Penang Hokkien">
<text>Penang Hokkien (; IPA: ) is a local variant of Hokkien spoken in Penang, Malaysia. It is spoken natively by 63.9% of Penang&#x27;s Chinese community, and also by some Penangite Indians and Penangite Malays.

It was once the &quot;lingua franca&quot; among the majority Chinese population in Penang, Kedah, Perlis and northern Perak. However, since the 1980s, many younger speakers have shifted towards Malaysian Mandarin under the Speak Mandarin Campaign in Chinese-medium schools in Malaysia, even though Mandarin was not previously spoken in these regions. Mandarin has been adopted as the only language of instruction in Chinese schools and, from the 1980s to mid-2010s, these schools penalised students and teachers for using non-Mandarin varieties of Chinese. A 2021 study found that Penang Hokkien was a &#x27;threatened&#x27; language in the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale, due to the encroachment of Mandarin.

Penang Hokkien is a subdialect of Zhangzhou (漳州; &quot;Tsiang-tsiu&quot;) Hokkien, with extensive use of Malay and English loanwords. Compared to dialects in Fujian (福建; &quot;Hok-kiàn&quot;) province, it most closely resembles the variety spoken in the district of Haicang (海滄; &quot;Hái-tshng&quot;) in Longhai (龍海; &quot;Liông-hái&quot;) county and in the districts of Jiaomei (角美; &quot;Kak-bí&quot;) and Xinglin (杏林; &quot;Hēng-lîm&quot;) in neighbouring Xiamen (廈門; &quot;Ēe-muî&quot;) prefecture. In Southeast Asia, similar dialects are spoken in the states bordering Penang (Kedah, Perlis and northern Perak), as well as in Medan and North Sumatra, Indonesia. It is markedly distinct from Southern Peninsular Malaysian Hokkien, Singaporean Hokkien and Taiwanese Hokkien.

==Orthography==
Penang Hokkien is largely a spoken language, however it can be written in Chinese characters (唐人字; &quot;Tn̂g-lâng-jī&quot;), or romanised in the Latin script (紅毛字; &quot;Âng-môo-jī&quot;). Penang Hokkien has a growing body of written, particularly romanised material, thanks largely in part to its increasing online presence on social media. Many topics focus on the language itself such as dictionaries and learning materials. This is linked to efforts to preserve, revitalise and promote the language as part of Penang&#x27;s cultural heritage, due to increasing awareness of the loss of Penang Hokkien usage among younger generations in favour of Mandarin and English. The standard romanisation systems commonly used in these materials are based on Tâi-lô and Pe̍͘h-ōa-jī, with varying modifications to suit Penang Hokkien phonology.

The Hokkien Language Association of Penang (&quot;Persatuan Bahasa Hokkien Pulau Pinang&quot;; 庇能福建話協會) is one such organisation which promotes the language&#x27;s usage and revitalisation. Through their Speak Hokkien Campaign they promote a Tâi-lô based system modified to suit the phonology of Penang Hokkien and its loanwords. This system is used throughout this article and its features are detailed below.

The Speak Hokkien Campaign also promotes the use of traditional Chinese characters derived from recommended character lists for written Hokkien published by Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Education.

Most native-speakers are not aware of these standardised systems and resort to ad hoc methods of romanisation based on English, Malay and Pinyin spelling rules. These methods are in common use for many proper names and food items, e.g. &quot;Char Kway Teow&quot; (炒粿條; &quot;tshá-kúe-tiâu&quot;). These spellings are often inconsistent and highly variable with several alternate spellings being well established, e.g. &quot;Char Koay Teow&quot;. These methods, which are more intuitive to the average native-speaker, are the basis of non-standard romanisation systems used in some written material.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
* Unlike other dialects of Hokkien, alveolar affricates and fricatives remain the same and do not undergo palatalisation to become alveolo-palatal before /i/, e.g. 時 [si] instead of [ɕi].
* Words that begin with a null initial, i.e. begin with a vowel without a preceding consonant may feature an initial glottal stop /ʔ/, this is not indicated in writing.
* The consonants and are only used in the spelling of loanwords. They may be analysed in terms of native Hokkien phonology as beginning with a null initial and may instead be spelled with and respectively, e.g. 我 &quot;wá&quot;/&quot;uá&quot; and 捎央 &quot;sa-yang&quot;/&quot;sa-iang&quot;.
* The consonants , , and are only used in loanwords.

===Vowels===
* In the Tâi-lô system for Penang Hokkien, nasal vowels are indicated using final , while Pe̍͘h-ōa-jī uses superscript . Vowel nasalisation occurs in words that have nasal initials (, , ), however, this is not explicitly indicated in writing with either or , e.g. 卵 &quot;nūi&quot; (/nuĩ/) instead of &quot;nūinn&quot;/&quot;nūiⁿ&quot;.&lt;br&gt;For most speakers who are not familiar with Tâi-lô or Pe̍͘h-ōa-jī, nasalisation is commonly indicated by putting an after the initial consonant of a word. This is commonly seen for the popular Penang delicacy &quot;Tau Sar Pneah&quot; (豆沙餅; &quot;tāu-sa-piánn&quot;). In other instances, nasalisation may not be indicated at all, such as in &quot;Popiah&quot; (薄餅; &quot;po̍h-piánn&quot;), or as in the common last name &quot;Ooi&quot; (黃; &quot;Uînn&quot;).
* The final is only written in conjunction with words that have an initial , e.g. 娘 &quot;niôo&quot;. In this instance it is pronounced /iɔ̃/ and is a variant of , with nasalisation instead indicated by the nasal initial.
* The rime is a variant pronunciation of . The two may be used interchangeably in Penang Hokkien, e.g. 張 &quot;tiaunn&quot;/&quot;tionn&quot;, 羊 &quot;iâunn&quot;/&quot;iônn&quot;.
* When is followed by final or , it is pronounced [iɛ], with and being pronounced as [iɛn] and [iɛt̚] respectively.&lt;br&gt;In speech, these sounds are often reduced to [ɛn] and [ɛt̚], e.g. 免 &quot;mián&quot;/&quot;mén&quot;.
* The diphthong /ua/ may be spelled in loanwords, e.g. 我 &quot;wá&quot;/&quot;uá&quot;.
* The diphthong /ia/ may be spelled in loanwords, e.g. &quot;sa-yang&quot;/&quot;sa-iang&quot; 捎央.
* There are clear distinction between /e/ and /ɛ/ vowel in Penang Hokkien. For example, the term 家 (home) is pronounced as /kɛ/ (Tâi-lô: ⟨kee⟩, Pe̍͘h-ōa-jī: ⟨ke͘⟩), while 雞 (chicken) is pronounced as /ke/, which is transcribed as ⟨ke⟩ in both Tâi-lô and Pe̍͘h-ōa-jī. However, a lot of Penang Hokkien Tâi-lô or Pe̍͘h-ōa-jī users were prone to ignore the difference. Reasons being the absence of formal letter on /ɛ/ from the orthodox Pe̍h-ōe-jī which is based on Amoy accent, and there are lack of support from most mainstream POJ input methods for the letter ⟨e͘⟩. Despite the existence of formal notation of /ɛ/ in Tâi-lô as ⟨ee⟩, some Tâi-lô users were seems to neglect it too, possibly due to the influence from Taiwanese online resources which don&#x27;t include letter /ee/ and not aware of it.


===Rhymes===
* * Used in loanwords, variants and onomatopoeia

===Tones===
In Penang Hokkien, the two &quot;Departing&quot; tones (3rd &amp; 7th) are virtually identical, and may not be distinguished except in their sandhi forms. Most native speakers of Penang Hokkien are therefore only aware of four tones in unchecked syllables (high, low, rising, high falling), and two &quot;Entering&quot; tones (high and low) in checked syllables. In most systems of romanisation, this is accounted as seven tones altogether. The tones are:

The names of the tones no longer bear any relation to the tone contours. The (upper) &quot;Rising&quot; (2nd) tone has two variants in Penang Hokkien, a high falling tone [˥˧] (53) and a high rising tone [˦˦˥] (445). The high falling tone [˥˧] (53) is more common among the older generations while in the younger generations there has been a shift towards the use of the high rising tone [˦˦˥] (445). When the 3rd tone is sandhied to the 2nd tone, the high falling variant [˥˧] (53) is used, however some speakers may sandhi the 3rd tone to the 1st tone [˦] (44). As in Amoy and Zhangzhou, there is no lower &quot;Rising&quot; (6th) tone.

====Tone sandhi====
Penang Hokkien, like other Hokkien dialects albeit less extensive, features tone sandhi (變調; &quot;piàn-tiāu&quot;), a process where the tone of a character changes if it is followed by another character as part of a multisyllabic compound. When a character is read in isolation as a monosyllabic word, or as the final character in a multisyllabic compound, it is pronounced with its &quot;original tone&quot; (本調; &quot;pún-tiāu&quot;). Within a multisyllabic compound, every character, except for the one in the final position undergoes tone sandhi. For example, the word 牛 &quot;gû&quot; in isolation is pronounced with an ascending tone, [˨˧] (23), but when it combines with a following syllable, as in 牛肉 &quot;gû-bah&quot;, it undergoes tone sandhi and is pronounced with a low tone, [˨˩] (21). Meanwhile 肉 &quot;bah&quot; in the final position is pronounced with its original tone [ʔ˧] (3). This process occurs regardless of the length of the compound, for example, in 牛肉粿條湯 &quot;gû-bah-kué-tiâu-thng&quot;, the first 4 characters are pronounced with their sandhied tone, while only the final character 湯 &quot;thng&quot;, is pronounced with its original tone.

In both Tâi-lô and Pe̍͘h-ōa-jī based romanisation systems, compounds are indicated with the use of hyphens linking the individual syllables. Single hyphens (-) are most often used and linked syllables undergo tone sandhi as described above. Double hyphens (--) are used in instances where the preceding syllable does not undergo tone sandhi. Tone marks always show the original tone, and do not change to indicate the sandhied tone in a compound.

The general tone sandhi rules for Penang Hokkien are as follows:
* 5th becomes 7th
* 7th becomes 3rd
* 3rd becomes 2nd (for some speakers becomes 1st)
* 2nd becomes 1st
* 1st becomes 7th

Checked syllables (-p, -t, -k, -h):
* 4th becomes 8th
* 8th becomes 4th

Although the two departing tones (3rd &amp; 7th) are virtually identical in Penang Hokkien, in their sandhi forms they become [˥˧] (53) and [˨˩] (21) and are thus easily distinguishable.

====Relationship between Hokkien and Mandarin tones====
There is a reasonably reliable correspondence between Hokkien and Mandarin tones:

* Upper &quot;Level&quot;: Hokkien 1st tone = Mandarin 1st tone, e.g. 雞 &quot;ke&quot;/&quot;jī&quot;.
* Lower &quot;Level&quot;: Hokkien 5th tone = Mandarin 2nd tone, e.g. 龍 &quot;lêng&quot;/&quot;lóng&quot;.
* &quot;Rising&quot;: Hokkien 2nd tone = Mandarin 3rd tone, e.g. 馬 &quot;bée&quot;/&quot;mǎ&quot;.
* &quot;Departing&quot;: Hokkien 3rd/7th tones = Mandarin 4th tone, e.g. 兔 &quot;thòo&quot;/&quot;tù&quot;, 象 &quot;tshiōnn&quot;/&quot;xiàng&quot;.

Words with &quot;Entering&quot; tones all end with , , or (glottal stop). As Mandarin no longer has any &quot;Entering&quot; tones, there is no simple corresponding relationship for the Hokkien 4th and 8th tones, e.g. 國 &quot;kok&quot;/&quot;guó&quot;, but 發 &quot;huat&quot;/&quot;fā&quot;. The tone in Mandarin often depends on what the initial consonant of the syllable is (see the article on Entering tones for details).

==Literary and colloquial pronunciations==
Hokkien has not been taught in schools in Penang since the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911, when Mandarin was made the Chinese national language. As such, few if any people have received any formal instruction in Hokkien, and it is not used for literary purposes. However, as in other variants of Min Nan, most words have both literary and colloquial pronunciations. Literary variants are generally eschewed in favour of colloquial pronunciations, e.g. 大學 &quot;tuā-o̍h&quot; instead of &quot;tāi-ha̍k&quot;, though literary pronunciations still appear in limited circumstances, e.g.:

* in given names (but generally not surnames), e.g. 安 &quot;an&quot; rather than , 玉 &quot;gio̍k&quot; rather than &quot;ge̍k&quot;, 月 &quot;gua̍t&quot; rather than &quot;gue̍h&quot;, 明 &quot;bêng&quot; rather than &quot;mêe&quot;
* in a few surnames, e.g. 葉 &quot;ia̍p&quot; rather than &quot;hio̍h&quot;
* in other proper names, e.g. 龍山堂 &quot;Liông-san-tông&quot; rather than &quot;Lêng-suann-tn̂g&quot;
* in certain set phrases, e.g. 差不多 &quot;tsha-put-to&quot; rather than &quot;tshee-m̄-to&quot;, 見笑 &quot;kiàn-siàu&quot; rather than &quot;kìnn-tshiò&quot;
* in certain names of plants, herbs, and spices, e.g. 木瓜 &quot;bo̍k-kua&quot; rather than &quot;ba̍k-kua&quot;, 五香 &quot;ngóo-hiong&quot; rather than &quot;gōo-hiong&quot;
* in names of certain professions, eg. 學生 &quot;ha̍k-seng&quot; instead of &quot;o̍h-senn&quot;, 醫生 &quot;i-seng&quot; rather than &quot;i-senn&quot;, and 老君 &quot;ló-kun&quot; instead of &quot;lāu-kun&quot;. A notable exception is 先生 &quot;sin-senn&quot;

Unlike in China, Taiwan, and the Philippines, the literary pronunciations of numbers higher than two are not used when giving telephone numbers, etc.; e.g. 二五四 &quot;jī-gōo-sì&quot; instead of &quot;jī-ngóo-sù&quot;.

==Differences from other varieties of Hokkien==
Penang Hokkien has differences in pronunciation and vocabulary when compared to other varieties of Hokkien. Although Penang Hokkien has many similarities to Zhangzhou Hokkien from which it is derived, it also has its own unique differences.

* The use of Zhangzhou pronunciations such as 糜 &quot;muâi&quot; (Amoy: &quot;bê&quot;), 先生 &quot;sin-senn&quot; (Amoy: &quot;sian-sinn&quot;), etc.;
* The use of Zhangzhou expressions such as 調羹 &quot;thâu-kiong&quot; (Amoy: 湯匙 &quot;thng-sî&quot;);
* The adoption of pronunciations from Teochew: e.g. 我 &quot;wá&quot;/&quot;uá&quot; (Zhangzhou: &quot;guá&quot;), 糜 &quot;môi&quot; (Zhangzhou: &quot;muâi&quot;);
* The adoption of Amoy and Quanzhou pronunciations like 歹勢 &quot;pháinn-sè&quot; (Zhangzhou: &quot;bái&quot;/&quot;pháinn-sì&quot;), 百 &quot;pah&quot; (Zhangzhou: &quot;peeh&quot;), etc.

General pronunciation differences can be shown as below:

==Loanwords==
Due to Penang&#x27;s linguistic and ethnic diversity, Penang Hokkien is in close contact with many other languages and dialects which are drawn on heavily for loanwords. These include Malay, Teochew, Cantonese and English.

===Malay===
Like other dialects in Malaysia and Singapore, Penang Hokkien borrows heavily from Malay, but sometimes to a greater extent than other Hokkien dialects, e.g.:

There are also many Hokkien words which have been borrowed into Malay, sometimes with slightly different meanings, e.g.:

===Other Chinese varieties===
There are words in Penang Hokkien that originated from other varieties of Chinese spoken in and around Malaysia. e.g.:

===English===
Penang Hokkien has also borrowed some words from English, some of which may have been borrowed via Malay. Often, these words tend to be more technical and less well embedded than the Malay words, e.g. brake, park, pipe, pump, etc. However some are used in common everyday language, e.g.:

===Thai===
Penang Hokkien also contains words which are thought to come from Thai, e.g.:

== Entertainment ==
In recent years, a number of movies that incorporate the use of Penang Hokkien have been filmed, as part of wider efforts to preserve the language&#x27;s relevance. Among the more recent movies are &quot;The Journey&quot;, which became the highest-grossing Malaysian film in 2014, and &quot;You Mean the World to Me&quot;, the first movie to be filmed entirely in Penang Hokkien.

Another significant contribution to the entertainment landscape is the Penang Hokkien Podcast. Founded in 2005 by John Ong, a Penangite residing in Kansas City, US - this podcast stands as the pioneering platform dedicated entirely to Penang-style Hokkien. The podcast offers a fun and engaging show for Penangites and individuals who understand the language. With its inception predating the recent wave of Penang Hokkien-focused films, the podcast provides a unique space for lighthearted and casual conversations with no topic restrictions. Listeners can enjoy funny and relatable discussions reminiscent of sharing secrets and stories with close friends.

As an initiative in the realm of Penang Hokkien entertainment, the Penang Hokkien Podcast complements the efforts to preserve the language&#x27;s relevance. It serves as an audio medium that celebrates the culture, and humour associated with Penang Hokkien, offering a valuable resource for those seeking an immersive experience.

An earlier and unexpected instance of Penang Hokkien in global entertainment can be traced back to the British sitcom &quot;Mind Your Language&quot; (1977–79). Malaysian-born actress Pik-Sen Lim, a native of Penang, portrayed Chung Su-Lee, a Chinese national. While her character would have been expected to speak Mandarin, Lim naturally spoke Penang Hokkien, the language she grew up identifying as &quot;Chinese&quot;. During the late 1970s, Mandarin had not yet gained global prominence, and the distinction went unnoticed by most viewers. This unintentional but authentic use of Penang Hokkien is likely the earliest recorded instance of the language being clearly spoken and heard on video, adding a unique and unplanned moment of representation for the language in international media. This occurrence underscores how Penang Hokkien forms a deep part of the identity of its speakers, even when representing different cultural contexts.

== Speak Hokkien Campaign ==
The Speak Hokkien Campaign is a social movement aimed at the revitalisation and promotion of the Hokkien language, with a particular focus on preserving its use among Hokkien-speaking communities worldwide. Launched online on 12 Jul 2015, the campaign began as a grassroots initiative on Facebook by Hokkien speakers from Penang, Malaysia, and has since grown into an active platform for spreading awareness and fostering pride in the language.

While its roots lie in Penang Hokkien, the campaign also shares information about other variants of Hokkien spoken in regions such as Singapore, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, and beyond, emphasising the language’s diversity and cultural richness.

The campaign contrasts with Singapore’s government-led Speak Mandarin Campaign, advocating instead for the preservation and use of Hokkien. The Facebook page is operated by members of the Persatuan Bahasa Hokkien Pulau Pinang (Hokkien Language Association of Penang), a non-governmental organisation officially established in 2014 to safeguard the linguistic and cultural heritage of Penang Hokkien. Through its online presence, the Speak Hokkien Campaign plays a crucial role in uniting Hokkien-speaking communities globally and inspiring a renewed appreciation for the language.

<doc id="592190" wikidata="Q4824826" url="?curid=592190" title="Civil Partnership Act 2004">
<text>The Civil Partnership Act 2004 (c. 33) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, introduced by the Labour government, which grants civil partnerships in the United Kingdom the rights and responsibilities very similar to those in civil marriage. Initially the Act permitted only same-sex couples to form civil partnerships. This was altered to include opposite-sex couples in 2019. Civil partners are entitled to the same property rights as married couples, the same exemption as married couples regarding social security and pension benefits, and also the ability to exercise parental responsibility for a partner&#x27;s children, as well as responsibility for reasonable maintenance of one&#x27;s partner and their children, tenancy rights, full life insurance recognition, next-of-kin rights in hospitals, and others. There is a formal process for dissolving civil partnerships, akin to divorce.

== Schedule 20 ==
Schedule 20 recognises certain overseas unions as equivalent to civil partnerships under the laws of the United Kingdom. Same-sex couples who have entered into those unions are automatically recognised in the United Kingdom as civil partners. In England and Wales, overseas marriages (but not other types of relationship) are automatically recognised as marriages by the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013; the same is true in Scotland by the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, and in Northern Ireland by The Marriage (Same-sex Couples) and Civil Partnership (Opposite-sex Couples) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2019.

Schedule 20 is subject to adjustment, and additional overseas relationships may be added as more jurisdictions across the world bring in civil partnership or same-sex marriage legislation. On 5 December 2005, the original schedule of the 2004 act was amended to include several other countries and states. On 31 January 2013, a further 50 types of overseas relationship were added to the schedule. Relationships not specified in the schedule may also recognised as civil partnerships if they meet the conditions of Section 214 of the Act, therefore many of the unions listed below as not listed in Schedule 20 may nonetheless be recognised.

== Legislative passage ==
The Act was announced in the Queen&#x27;s Speech at the start of the 2003/2004 legislative session, and its full text was revealed on 31 March 2004. It received royal assent on 18 November 2004 and came into force on 5 December 2005, allowing the first couples to form civil partnerships 15 days later. Confusion regarding the interpretation of the Act led to registrations being accepted from 19 December in Northern Ireland, 20 December in Scotland and 21 December in England and Wales. The Scottish Parliament voted in favour of a Legislative Consent Motion allowing Westminster to legislate for Scotland in this Act.

=== Political opposition and support ===
The Bill was backed by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the SNP and the SDLP. It was opposed by the DUP and the UUP. Conservative Party MPs were split on the issue, and the party leadership did not issue a whip mandating MPs to take a particular stance on the Bill, instead allowing its MPs a free vote. This decision was described by some in the British media as an attempt to demonstrate a shift to a more inclusive, centrist approach under the leadership of Michael Howard, and as a departure from the alleged active opposition to LGBT rights under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith. As party leader, Duncan Smith had imposed a three-line whip against the Adoption and Children Bill, mandating all Conservative MPs to vote against extending adoption rights to same-sex couples. Conservative MPs split 67 in favour to 37 against at the second reading, and 43 in favour to 39 against at the third reading. High-profile Conservative MPs who voted against the Civil Partnerships Bill included Iain Duncan Smith, Ann Widdecombe, Bob Spink and Peter Lilley. Those who voted in favour included David Cameron, George Osborne and party leader Michael Howard. Around 30 Conservative MPs did not participate in any of the votes.

=== Amendments ===
An amendment tabled by Conservative MP Edward Leigh proposed to extend the property and pension rights afforded by civil partnerships to siblings who had lived together for more than 12 years. This was opposed by many backers of the bill, such as frontbench Conservative MP Alan Duncan, who considered it a wrecking amendment. Leigh himself was an opponent of the Civil Partnerships bill, and voted against it at the second reading. The amendment was backed by Norman Tebbit and the Christian Institute, which paid for a full page advert in favour of the amendment in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. Labour and the Liberal Democrats issued a whip against the Leigh Amendment, and only two MPs from each party rebelled to vote in favour of it.

On 24 June 2004, during the discussion at the report stage in the House of Lords, Conservative peer Baroness O&#x27;Cathain moved an amendment to extend eligibility for civil partnership to blood relatives who had lived together for a minimum period of time. This amendment was passed in the Lords by 148 to 130, a majority of 18. Like the Leigh amendment, opponents considered the O&#x27;Cathain amendment to be a wrecking amendment, and like Leigh, O&#x27;Cathain herself voted against the Civil Partnerships Bill. Labour Peer Baron Alli, said the amendment was &quot;ill-conceived and does nothing other than undermine the purpose of the bill&quot;, while the gay rights group Stonewall said the amendment was &quot;unworkable and undermined hundreds of years of family law&quot;.

The House of Commons later voted 381—74 to remove this amendment, and sent the revised Bill back to the Lords for reconsideration. On 17 November, the Lords accepted the Commons version by a vote of 251 to 136; the bill received royal assent the next day.

== Legal process to form a civil partnership in the UK ==
To form a civil partnership in the UK, both parties must be over the age of 16, not already in a civil partnership or marriage, and not be within the prohibited degrees of relationship. If of the age of 16 or 17, the consent of the individual&#x27;s parent or guardian is required, except in Scotland, where marriages and civil partnerships can take place from the age of 16 with no need for parental consent.

From 2004 to 2019 both parties to a partnership also had to be of the same sex. This requirement was removed by Parliament in March 2019, and since 2 December 2019 couples irrespective of sex can register their intent to form a civil partnership.

To complete the registration process, the couple must each give notice of their intention to the registry office. After 15 days they can complete the registration process. The couple can also have a ceremony if they choose but this is not a requirement of the Act. The first date on which notice could be given was 5 December 2005 and the first registration was on 21 December 2005. The 15-day notice period allows the registrar to check that the couple is eligible to go ahead with the registration.

===Expansion of civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples===
In June 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in the Steinfeld–Keidan case that restricting civil partnerships to same-sex couples was discriminatory and mandated that the Government change the law, although did not set a timeline for doing so. In response, the Prime Minister announced in October 2018 that civil partnerships would be opened to heterosexual couples. Legislation that requires the Secretary of State to issue regulations amending the Civil Partnership Act, so that opposite-sex couples may enter into civil partnerships, passed the Parliament on 15 March and received royal assent on 26 March 2019. The legislation was enacted on 26 May 2019 in the form of the Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration etc) Act 2019. The regulations came into effect on 2 December 2019, the date on which opposite-sex couples could register their intent to form a civil partnership. This expansion of civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples applies only in England and Wales, and not in Scotland or Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, civil partnerships were extended to opposite-sex couples by The Marriage (Same-sex Couples) and Civil Partnership (Opposite-sex Couples) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2019.

<text>François-Joachim de Pierre de Bernis, comte de Lyonnais (22 May 1715 – 3 November 1794) was a French cardinal and diplomat. He was the sixth member elected to occupy Seat 3 of the Académie française in 1744. Bernis was a prominent figure in the autobiography of Giacomo Casanova, &quot;Histoire de ma vie&quot; (&quot;Story of My Life&quot;), starting from the chapter on &quot;Convent Affairs&quot;.

==Biography==
Born at Saint-Marcel d&#x27;Ardèche, de Bernis was of a noble, but impoverished family, and, being a younger son, was intended for the church. His father, Joachim de Pierre, seigneur de Bernis, was a captain of cavalry and, in 1697, was married to Marie Elisabeth, daughter of Nicolas de Chastel de Condres. The cardinal&#x27;s elder brother was Philippe Charles François (1714–1774), baron de Pierrebourg, marquis de Pierre de Bernis, seigneur de Saint-Marcel. François was educated at the Louis-le-Grand college and the seminary of Saint-Sulpice, Paris, but did not take holy orders until 1755.

Bernis became known as one of the most expert epigrammatists in the gay society of Louis XV of France&#x27;s court, and by his verses won the friendship of Madame de Pompadour, the royal mistress, who obtained for him an apartment, furnished at her expense, in the Tuileries, and a yearly pension of 1500 livres. Voltaire admired his verses, calling him &quot;Babet la bouquetière&quot;. In 1744, he was elected to seat 3 of the Académie française.

In 1752, Bernis was appointed to the French embassy at Venice, where he acted, to the satisfaction of both parties, as mediator between the republic and Pope Benedict XIV. During his stay in Venice he received subdeacon&#x27;s orders, and on his return to France in 1755 was made a papal councillor of state.

Bernis took an important part in the delicate negotiations between France and Austria which preceded the Seven Years&#x27; War. He regarded the alliance purely as a temporary expedient, and did not propose to employ the whole forces of France in a general war. But he was overruled by his colleagues. Bernis became secretary for foreign affairs on 27 June 1757, but owing to his attempts to counteract the spendthrift policy of the marquise de Pompadour and her followers, he fell into disgrace and was, in December 1758, banished to Soissons by Louis XV, where he remained in retirement for six years. In the previous November he had been created cardinal by Pope Clement XIII.

On the death of the royal mistress in 1764, Bernis was recalled and once more offered the seals of office, but declined them, and was appointed archbishop of Albi. His occupancy of the see was not of long duration. In 1769, he went to Rome to assist at the conclave which resulted in the election of Pope Clement XIV, and the talent which he displayed on that occasion procured him the appointment of ambassador to Rome, where he spent the remainder of his life. He was partly instrumental in bringing about the suppression of the Jesuits, and acted with greater moderation than is generally allowed. He assisted the wavering pope in securing the delays for which he had asked. But the pressure exercised by the Bourbons of Spain, Naples, and France, and the passive attitude and tacit consent of Austria brought the negotiations to an abrupt termination. During the French Revolution, he celebrated, in the national church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, a solemn funeral for Louis XVI of France, who had been executed on the guillotine in 1793. He resigned the administration of his archdiocese rather than take the constitutional oath.

Bernis lost his influence under Pius VI, who was friendly to the Jesuits, to whom he was hostile. He was reduced almost to penury but the court of Spain, mindful of the support he had given to their ambassador in obtaining the condemnation of the Jesuits, came to his relief with a handsome pension. He devoted himself to the French exiles, placing his palace at the disposal of the princesses of France who had sought refuge in Rome, for Pope Pius VI bestowed on him posthumously the epithet &quot;Protector of the Church of France&quot;.

Bernis died at Rome on 3 November 1794, and was buried in the church of S. Luigi de Francesi. In 1803 his remains were transferred to the cathedral at Nîmes. His poems, the longest of which is &quot;La Religion vengée&quot; (Parma, 1794), were collected and published after his death (Paris, 1797, etc.). His &quot;Mémoires et lettres 1715-58&quot; (8 vols. Paris. 1878) are still interesting to the historian.

<text>Richard Martin West (born 1941) is a Danish astronomer and discoverer of astronomical objects with a long career at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and at the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

He discovered numerous comets, including Comet West (C/1975 V1), which was one of the brightest comets of the 1970s, and the periodic comets 76P/West–Kohoutek–Ikemura and 123P/West–Hartley.

He is also credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 40 minor planets between 1976 and 1986, including 2146 Stentor and 2148 Epeios, two Trojan asteroids. Together with Hans-Emil Schuster, he co-discovered the Phoenix Dwarf galaxy.

== Early life and education ==

West was born in Copenhagen in 1941. He completed high school in 1959 and then achieved a degree in astronomy and astrophysics from University of Copenhagen in 1964.

== Career at ESO ==
Richard West began working at ESO in 1970, when he joined as Assistant Astronomer to the ESO Director General, Adriaan Blaauw. His career took a leap in 1972, when he charged one of the first and largest scientific programmes of ESO: the Sky Atlas Laboratory project to systematically map the southern hemisphere.

West was a leading figure in helping out and establishing serious collaborations with the scientific communities of the Central and Eastern European countries in the wake of the political, social and economical turmoil following the collapse and dismantling of the Soviet bloc in the early 1990s. 

West retired in 2005, after a continuous employment at ESO.

== Positions ==

Richard West focussed a lot of his worklife on the organizational matters of the international scientific community in addition to science communications in general. He held a number of influential positions:
* Assistant General Secretary of the IAU in 1979–1982.
* General Secretary of the IAU (1982–1985). 
* Presided over a number of IAU Commissions, including Commission 20 from 1988 to 1991.
* Member of the Executive Committee of ICSU.

== Awards and honors ==
* Rosenkjaer Prize. A prestigious award in Denmark, given for outstanding science or culture communication.
* The main-belt asteroid 2022 West was named in his honor.

<doc id="592198" wikidata="Q7623484" url="?curid=592198" title="Stretch rule">
<text>In classical mechanics, the stretch rule (sometimes referred to as [[Edward Routh|Routh]]&#x27;s rule) states that the moment of inertia of a rigid object is unchanged when the object is stretched parallel to an axis of rotation that is a principal axis, provided that the distribution of mass remains unchanged except in the direction parallel to the axis. This operation leaves cylinders oriented parallel to the axis unchanged in radius.

This rule can be applied with the parallel axis theorem and the perpendicular axis theorem to find moments of inertia for a variety of shapes.

==Derivation==
The (scalar) moment of inertia of a rigid body around the z-axis is given by:

:formula_1

Where formula_2 is the distance of a point from the z-axis. We can expand as follows, since we are dealing with stretching over the &quot;z&quot;-axis only:

:formula_3

Here, formula_4 is the body&#x27;s height. Stretching the object by a factor of formula_5 along the z-axis is equivalent to dividing the mass density by formula_5 (meaning formula_7), as well as integrating over new limits formula_8 and formula_9 (the new height of the object), thus leaving the total mass unchanged. This means the new moment of inertia will be:

:formula_10

<doc id="592200" wikidata="Q769567" url="?curid=592200" title="Britain's Best Sitcom">
<text>Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom was a BBC media campaign in which television viewers were asked to decide the best British situation comedy. Viewers could vote via telephone, SMS, or BBC Online. This first round of voting was conducted in 2003, after which the BBC published a list of the top 100 selections. From this list, they produced a 12-episode television series broadcast by BBC Two from January through to March 2004.

The series was a retrospective that examined the history and qualities of the contending programmes. In the first episode, Jonathan Ross summarised the progress of the poll and presented video clips from the 50 sitcoms that received the most votes. Each of the next ten weekly episodes, one hour in length, focused on one sitcom. In each episode, a different celebrity presenter advocated a particular sitcom, delivering 20 reasons why it deserved viewers&#x27; votes. The sitcom&#x27;s writers and actors, as well as celebrity viewers, also shared their own perspectives and memories. In the 90-minute series finale, transmitted live, Jonathan Ross announced the top sitcom to be &quot;Only Fools and Horses,&quot; with &quot;Blackadder&quot; in second place and &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot; in third place.

Notably, all finalists were BBC productions, with ITV and Channel 4 sitcoms not appearing (&quot;Father Ted&quot;, the highest-ranked non-BBC sitcom, was at number 11).

<text>John Bagnell Bury (; 16 October 1861 – 1 June 1927) was an Anglo-Irish historian, classical scholar, Medieval Roman historian and philologist. He objected to the label &quot;Byzantinist&quot; explicitly in the preface to the 1889 edition of his &quot;Later Roman Empire&quot;. He was Erasmus Smith&#x27;s Professor of Modern History at Trinity College Dublin (1893–1902), before being Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge and a Professorial Fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge from 1902 until his death.

==Early life and education==
Bury was born the son of Edward John Bury and Anna Rogers in 1861 in Clontibret, County Monaghan, where his father was Rector of the Anglican Church of Ireland. He was educated first by his parents and then at Foyle College in Derry. He studied classics at Trinity College Dublin, where he was elected a scholar in 1879, and graduated in 1882. 

He was elected a fellow of Trinity College Dublin in 1885 at the age of 24. Also in that year, he married his second cousin Jane Bury, who assisted him in his work, notably with her chapter on Byzantine art in the History of the later Roman Empire (1889); they had one son. In 1893, he was appointed to the Erasmus Smith&#x27;s Chair of Modern History at Trinity College, which he held for nine years. In 1898 he was appointed Regius Professor of Greek, also at Trinity, a post he held simultaneously with his history professorship. In late 1902 he became Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge, and early the following year he was elected a Professorial Fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

At Cambridge, Bury became a mentor to Steven Runciman (the medievalist), who later commented that he had been Bury&#x27;s &quot;first, and only, student&quot;. At first, the reclusive Bury tried to brush him off; then, when Runciman mentioned that he could read Russian, Bury gave him a stack of Bulgarian articles to edit, and so their relationship began. Bury was the author of the first truly authoritative biography of Saint Patrick (1905).

Bury remained at Cambridge until his death at the age of 65 in Rome, where he took his annual retreat since 1918. He is buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome.

He received the honorary degree Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901, the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of Aberdeen in 1905, and the honorary degree Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Oxford in October 1902, in connection with the tercentenary of the Bodleian Library.

His brother, Robert Gregg Bury, was an Irish clergyman, classicist, philologist, and a translator of the works of Plato and Sextus Empiricus into English.

==Writings==

Bury&#x27;s writings, on subjects ranging from ancient Greece to the 19th-century papacy, are at once scholarly and accessible to the layman. His two works on the philosophy of history elucidated the Victorian ideals of progress and rationality which undergirded his more specific histories. He also led a revival of Byzantine history (which he considered and explicitly called Roman history), which English-speaking historians, following Edward Gibbon, had largely neglected. In 1886–88 he published a series of articles on the Frankish domination in Greece. In 1892 he was among the first contributors to Karl Krumbacher&#x27;s journal &quot;Byzantinische Zeitschrift&quot;. He contributed to, and was himself the subject of, an article in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. With Frank Adcock and S. A. Cook he edited &quot;The Cambridge Ancient History&quot;, launched in 1919.

In 1913, Bury wrote &quot;&quot;, a book from the freethinking perspective criticizing Christianity and the Catholic Church as being against reason. In response, Hilaire Belloc wrote exposing numerous historical inaccuracies in the book, and accusing him of not doing original research, but simply &quot;repeating what some other man of the same kind has said before him, and that other man is repeating something that was said before &quot;him&quot;.&quot;

===History as a science===
Bury&#x27;s career shows his evolving thought process and his consideration of the discipline of history as a &quot;science&quot;. From his inaugural lecture as Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge delivered on 26 January 1903 comes his public proclamation of history as a &quot;science&quot; and not as a branch of &quot;literature&quot;. He stated:
I may remind you that history is not a branch of literature. The facts of history, like the facts of geology or astronomy, can supply material for literary art; for manifest reasons they lend themselves to artistic representation far more readily than those of the natural sciences; but to clothe the story of human society in a literary dress is no more the part of a historian as a historian, than it is the part of an astronomer as an astronomer to present in an artistic shape the story of the stars.
Bury&#x27;s lecture continues by defending the claim that history is not literature, which in turn questions the need for a historian&#x27;s narrative in the discussion of historical facts and essentially evokes the question: is a narrative necessary? But Bury describes his &quot;science&quot; by comparing it to Leopold von Ranke&#x27;s idea of science and the German phrase that brought Ranke&#x27;s ideas fame when he exclaimed &quot;tell history as it happened&quot; or &quot;Ich will nur sagen wie es eigentlich gewesen ist.&quot; [I only want to say how it actually happened.] Bury&#x27;s final thoughts during his lecture reiterate his previous statement with a cementing sentence that argues &quot;...she [history] is herself simply a science, no less and no more&quot;.

<doc id="592203" wikidata="Q149374" url="?curid=592203" title="25143 Itokawa">
<text>25143 Itokawa (provisional designation ) is a sub-kilometer near-Earth object of the Apollo group and also a potentially hazardous asteroid. It was discovered by the LINEAR program in 1998 and later named after Japanese rocket engineer Hideo Itokawa. The peanut-shaped S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 12.1 hours and measures approximately in diameter. Due to its low density and high porosity, Itokawa is considered to be a rubble pile, consisting of numerous boulders of different sizes rather than of a single solid body.

It was the first asteroid to be the target of a sample-return mission, of the Japanese space probe &quot;Hayabusa&quot;, which collected more than 1500 regolith dust particles from the asteroid&#x27;s surface in 2005. Since its return to Earth in 2010, the mineralogy, petrography, chemistry, and isotope ratios of these particles have been studied in detail, providing insights into the evolution of the Solar System. Itokawa was the smallest asteroid to be photographed and visited by a spacecraft prior to the DART mission to Dimorphos in 2022.

== Discovery and naming ==
Itokawa was discovered on 26 September 1998 by astronomers with the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program at Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States. It was given the provisional designation . The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its first observation by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey just one week prior to its official discovery observation. The minor planet was named in memory of Japanese rocket scientist Hideo Itokawa (1912–1999), who is regarded as the father of Japanese rocketry. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 6 August 2003 ().

== Orbit and classification ==
Itokawa belongs to the Apollo asteroids. They are Earth-crossing asteroids and the largest dynamical group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10,000 known members. Itokawa orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.95–1.70 AU once every 18 months (557 days; semi-major axis of 1.32 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. It has a low &quot;Earth minimum orbital intersection distance&quot; of , which corresponds to 5.1 lunar distances.

== Exploration ==
In 2000, it was selected as the target of Japan&#x27;s &quot;Hayabusa&quot; mission. The probe arrived in the vicinity of Itokawa on 12 September 2005 and initially &quot;parked&quot; in an asteroid–Sun line at , and later , from the asteroid (Itokawa gravity was too weak to provide an orbit, so the spacecraft adjusted its orbit around the Sun until it matched the asteroid&#x27;s). Hayabusa landed on 20 November for thirty minutes, but it failed to operate a device designed to collect soil samples. On 25 November, a second landing and sampling sequence was attempted. The sample capsule was returned to Earth and landed at Woomera, South Australia on 13 June 2010, around 13:51 UTC (23:21 local). On 16 November 2010, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency reported that dust collected during Hayabusa&#x27;s voyage was indeed from the asteroid.

=== Surface features ===
Names of major surface features were proposed by &quot;Hayabusa&quot; scientists and accepted by the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature of the International Astronomical Union. Also, the Hayabusa science team is using working names for smaller surface features. The following tables list the names of geological features on the asteroid. No naming conventions have been disclosed for surface features on Itokawa.

==== Craters ====
Ten impact craters on the surface of Itokawa were named on 18 February 2009.
==== Regiones ====
Regio or regiones are large area marked by reflectivity or color distinctions from adjacent areas in planetary geology. The following regiones have been named on Itokawa.
== Physical characteristics ==

Itokawa is a stony S-type asteroid. Radar imaging by Goldstone in 2001 observed an ellipsoid meters long and meters wide.

The &quot;Hayabusa&quot; mission confirmed these findings and also suggested that Itokawa may be a contact binary formed by two or more smaller asteroids that have gravitated toward each other and stuck together. The &quot;Hayabusa&quot; images show a surprising lack of impact craters and a very rough surface studded with boulders, described by the mission team as a rubble pile. Furthermore, the density of the asteroid is too low for it to be made from solid rock. This would mean that Itokawa is not a monolith but rather a rubble pile formed from fragments that have cohered over time. Based on Yarkovsky–O&#x27;Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack effect measurements, a small section of Itokawa is estimated to have a density of , whereas a larger section is estimated to have a density of 1.8 g/cm3.

=== Rotation period and poles ===
Since 2001, a large number of rotational lightcurves of Itokawa have been obtained from photometric observations. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve by Mikko Kaasalainen gave a sidereal rotation period of hours with a high brightness variation of 0.8 magnitude, indicative of the asteroid&#x27;s non-spherical shape (). In addition, Kaasalainen also determined two spin axes of (355.0°, −84.0°) and (39°, −87.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β). Alternative lightcurve measurements were made by Lambert ( h), Lowry ( and  h), Ohba ( h), Warner ( h), Ďurech ( h), and Nishihara ( h).

=== Composition ===

The 26 August 2011 issue of &quot;Science&quot; devoted six articles to findings based on dust that &quot;Hayabusa&quot; had collected from Itokawa. Scientists&#x27; analysis suggested that Itokawa was probably made up from interior fragments of a larger asteroid that broke apart. Dust collected from the asteroid surface is thought to have been exposed there for about eight million years.

Scientists used varied techniques of chemistry and mineralogy to analyze the dust from Itokawa. Itokawa composition was found to match the common type of meteorites known as &quot;low-total-iron, low metal ordinary chondrites&quot;. Another team of scientists determined that the dark iron color on the surface of Itokawa was the result of abrasion by micrometeoroids and high-speed particles from the Sun which had converted the normally whitish iron oxide coloring.

==== 2018 Hayabusa results ====

Two separate groups report water in different Itokawa particles. Jin et al. report water in low-calcium pyroxene grains. The water&#x27;s isotope level corresponds with inner Solar System and carbonaceous chondrite water isotope levels. Daly et al. report &quot;OH and &quot; apparently formed by implantation of solar wind hydrogen. The rims of an olivine particle &quot;show an enrichment of up to ~1.2 at % in OH and H2O&quot;. The water concentrations of the Itokawa grains would indicate an estimated BSI (Bulk Silicate Itokawa) water content in line with Earth&#x27;s bulk water, and that Itokawa had been a &quot;water-rich asteroid&quot;.

==== 2020 Hayabusa results ====

At the 2020 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, a third group reported water and organics, via a third Hayabusa particle- RA-QD02-0612, or &quot;Amazon.&quot; Olivine, pyroxene, and albite contain water. Isotopic compositions indicate a clear extraterrestrial origin.

==== 2021 Hayabusa results ====
A further report by Daly&#x27;s group was published which supported the theory that a large source of Earth&#x27;s water has come from hydrogen atoms carried on particles in the solar wind which combine with oxygen on asteroids and then arrive on Earth in space dust. Using atom probe tomography the study found hydroxide and water molecules on the surface of a single grain from particles retrieved from the asteroid Itokawa by the Japanese space probe Hayabusa.

Dust ponds are identified in the asteroid. They are a phenomenon where pockets of dust are seen in Celestial bodies without a significant atmosphere. Smooth deposits of dust accumulate in depressions on the surface of the body (like craters), contrasting from the Rocky terrain around them. In the Sagamihara and Muses-Sea regions of the asteroid dust ponds were identified. Dust particles had a size varying from millimeters to less than a centimeter.

<text>Altered Beast is a 1988 beat &#x27;em up arcade video game developed and published by Sega. The game is set in Ancient Greece and follows a player character chosen by Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena from the demonic ruler of the underworld, Neff. By collecting three power-ups in a level, the player character transforms into one of five magical beasts. It was ported to several home video game consoles and home computers. &quot;Altered Beast&quot; was the pack-in game when the Genesis launched in North America and the Mega Drive in Europe.

The game&#x27;s development was led by Makoto Uchida which was his first time as a project lead. Uchida and his team used the System 16 arcade system board.

&quot;Altered Beast&quot;″s arcade release and its ports received generally positive reviews, mainly praising the gameplay and graphics. The game has been re-released several times for various consoles and as part of video game compilations, and there have been one sequel and one reboot.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Altered Beast&quot; is a side scrolling beat &#x27;em up game with light platform elements. It has five levels and can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Combat takes place across five levels set in Ancient Greece and populated by aggressive undead creatures and monsters resembling those from Greek mythology. The demonic god Neff waits at the end of each level. Between each level are small animations giving the player glimpses of Athena&#x27;s peril. Players can punch, kick and jump.

The game&#x27;s premise is that Neff, ruler of the underworld, captures the goddess Athena. Angry, her father, the Olympian god Zeus, decides to choose a champion to save her. Respecting the bravery of Roman Centurions, Zeus resurrects one of them and empowers him as a champion. The game&#x27;s player character is the resurrected Roman Centurion, given extra power by Zeus so they can battle Neff and his supernatural minions. In the original arcade game, the end credits include the revelation that the whole game actually depicted a staged film production.

Whenever a player defeats a white two-headed wolf, a Spirit Ball power-up appears. Each obtained Spirit Ball increases the player character&#x27;s strength and size. Collecting three Spirit Balls allows the player character to transform into a powerful beast form, increasing their combat abilities before having to face Neff at the end of the level. The player character&#x27;s beast forms include a weredragon, a werebear, a weretiger, a werewolf, or a golden werewolf. Each beast form grants its own abilities. The dragon can unleash lightning bolts and an electric barrier, the bear has a petrifying breath that turns enemies into stone, the tiger can throw fireballs in a zig-zag pattern, the wolf can throw direct, but weak fireballs and has a powerful thrust attack, while the golden werewolf has the same abilities as the wolf form. In the Famicom version of the game, available beast forms also include a shark, lion, and phoenix form.

== Development ==
&quot;Altered Beast&quot; was developed by Makoto Uchida. He took inspiration for the game from &quot;The Howling&quot; and the music video for the Michael Jackson song &quot;Thriller&quot;, as well as movies by Ray Harryhausen, and chose the Greek setting for the powerful characters he had in mind. Uchida admitted that he struggled during production because it was his first game he developed, and so he leaned on his lead programmer to help create balance in the gameplay.

One of Uchida&#x27;s goals was to create flashy visuals that would surprise players, so he asked his lead artist to focus just on the player character&#x27;s transformation sequences for one month. Additionally, he and his team used the System 16 arcade system board for its ability to add great detail to large character sprites, as well as the visual effects it could provide, such as limbs flying off characters during combat. Uchida was not impressed by the initial concept art, so he worked with an artist to sketch out his specific ideas on character design. While the results of this were positive, Uchida&#x27;s lead designer quit the team over this situation. &quot;Altered Beast&quot; includes Easter eggs that are references to other System 16 titles &quot;Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars&quot; and &quot;Shinobi&quot;, as a nod to members on Uchida&#x27;s team that had worked on those titles previously.

There were planned features for the game that Uchida did not have the opportunity to implement, namely a pressure-sensitive button. Discussions took place but a deal could not be reached with the owner of the patent of the pressure-sensitive device over the small number to be ordered. The failure to secure the button meant that half of the planned character actions had to be removed. Uchida claims that the reduced complexity of the game caused by this caused players to tire of &quot;Altered Beast&quot; quickly. Despite this, Uchida was proud of the reactions he was getting from players during play testing.

==Releases==

Released in June 1988, &quot;Altered Beast&quot; arcade version proved to be more popular overseas than it did in Japan. As a result of its popularity, it was selected to be ported and made the pack-in game for the Sega Genesis and Mega Drive in North America and Europe. Uchida was not involved directly with either the Genesis or the Master System port, though he did give some advice and noted he was not worried about the Genesis port because its hardware was based on the System 16 arcade system board he used. He had hoped to implement the pressure-sensitive button for the Genesis port, but could not due to tight development time and the lack of the button in Genesis hardware. Because &quot;Altered Beast&quot; was not the pack-in game in Japan, Uchida did not get to see his game included with the console. By the time he went to the US three years later, all of the available consoles instead included &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, which replaced &quot;Altered Beast&quot; in part over concerns the latter&#x27;s themes of zombies and magic were not popular in the Bible Belt.

In addition to the Genesis and Master System, &quot;Altered Beast&quot; was ported to several platforms, including for PC Engine, PC Engine-CD, Famicom, Atari ST, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Amiga. Several of the conversions for European systems were completed by Activision. Certain differences are seen between the several versions of the game. Some of them, like the Master System version, were missing levels. Others provided additional beasts to mutate into, such as a humanoid lion, shark, and phoenix forms seen in the Famicom version, ported by Asmik.

The Genesis version is included in the compilations &quot;Sega Smash Pack&quot;, &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot;, and &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot;, with the latter two also including the arcade version as an unlockable game. The Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service, the Xbox 360&#x27;s Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation 3&#x27;s PlayStation Network all received a version of the game. In 2017, &quot;Altered Beast&quot; was rereleased on iOS and Android as a part of the Sega Forever collection. M2 released a 3D port for the Nintendo 3DS as a digital download on the Nintendo eShop. The game was also included as one of the pre-loaded games on the SEGA Genesis Mini. This game has also been released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on December 16, 2021.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Altered Beast&quot; was the second highest-grossing arcade game of the month in July 1988.

Upon its initial arcade release, &quot;Altered Beast&quot; received mixed reviews. &quot;Commodore User&quot; called it &quot;a clever game, and well worth a few tens of anybody&#x27;s money.&quot; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s plot as being unoriginal and the graphics as &quot;large and clumsily drawn&quot;. &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; stated the game was &quot;not recommended to those that are still living&quot;. By contrast, &quot;Crash&quot; called the graphics &quot;nifty&quot; and suggested that despite the repetitive plot, the gameplay is compelling. &quot;The Games Machine&quot; offered a positive review, stating that while the game is not highly visual like &quot;Out Run&quot; or &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, the gameplay makes the game worth a play.

The various ports of &quot;Altered Beast&quot; received more mixed reviews. &quot;The Games Machine&quot; gave the Mega Drive version a positive review on the faithful arcade conversion. In 1989, &quot;ACE&quot; praised the Mega Drive conversion as never having played better on any home system, and they rated it as the best Mega Drive game available at the time. &quot;Sega Power&quot;, however, criticized the same version for jerky gameplay and bad scrolling. The PC Engine CD conversion was panned by &quot;The Games Machine&quot;, which called the port &quot;a disappointment&quot; and suggested players who want to play the game try the Mega Drive version instead.

Julian Rignall of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; criticized the Master System version, stating that while he is a fan of the arcade version, the reduced graphics, slow gameplay of the port, and fussy collision detection are significant issues. Contrary to their praise for the Mega Drive port, &quot;The Games Machine&quot; called the Master System version &quot;a middling conversion of a nice coin-op&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; was more positive, claiming the game &quot;does a good job of capturing most of the familiar play mechanics of its arcade cousin.&quot; &quot;Sega Pro&quot; called the Master System version &quot;a shame, since the Mega Drive version was a great success.&quot; &quot;S: The Sega Magazine&quot; stated that there are better arcade conversions on the Master System and that &quot;Altered Beast&quot;, while having a passable soundtrack, suffers from poor animation and control issues.

&quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #10 in their list of the 10 Worst Mega Drive Games of All Time. Its re-release for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console was given a lukewarm reception by GameSpot and IGN, describing the game as merely decent with some nostalgic value. The Xbox Live Arcade re-release was even described by IGN as a &quot;relic of the arcade heyday that just doesn&#x27;t hold up today&quot;.

==Legacy==
Video game journalist Ken Horowitz stated that video gamers identify the &quot;rise from your grave&quot; opening from the game, whether they are fans of Sega&#x27;s games or not. According to Horowitz, &quot;Altered Beast&quot; biggest attraction is its charm, which was reduced in the modifications to the game&#x27;s Genesis port, and has called the game &quot;one of the more memorable concepts Sega conceived.&quot; Uchida has expressed surprise over the sustained popularity around his arcade games, stating &quot;When I occasionally visit videogame arcades in the US, I still see people playing my &quot;Altered Beast&quot; and &quot;Golden Axe&quot; games. It proves to me that, if the game is good, people will still pay good money to play it.&quot;

===Sequels===
&quot;Altered Beast&quot; has received two sequels. &quot;Altered Beast: Guardian of the Realms&quot;, developed by 3d6 Games and published by THQ, is a 2002 sequel for Game Boy Advance in the style of the original arcade game. It adds new features like power-ups and beast forms, as well as 15 levels. While the graphics are improved compared to the original game, the scrolling mechanic remains the same. A PlayStation 2 title known as &quot;Jūōki: Project Altered Beast&quot; in Japan and &quot;Altered Beast&quot; in Europe was released by Sega in 2005. It was planned for a North American release as well, but was later cancelled. Rather than serving as a sequel to the original game, the newer title features a more modern setting that is unconnected to the original game, with a darker and more violent tone. Uchida advised on the project, and stated, &quot;We really couldn&#x27;t steer away from the violence aspect. The American marketing side was cheering us on, so we did it as best we could.&quot; The 2005 &quot;Altered Beast&quot; received mixed reviews for its camera system and poor graphics. 
==Film adaptation==
In 2014, Sega announced a partnership with Evan Cholfin for film and TV projects based on their games. &quot;Altered Beast&quot; was announced as live action project in 2016.

===Popular culture===
&quot;Altered Beast&quot; has been referenced in other media. In 1993, Matthew Sweet named his album &quot;Altered Beast&quot; after the game. Sweet told &quot;Spin&quot; magazine that the title meant &quot;whatever is inside you that someday might explode, and maybe you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s there&quot;, which he found similar to the game, where &quot;you have to find these little power-up things, and when you eat them you become the Altered Beast, this other creature that&#x27;s really powerful and violent&quot;. The character Neff, in his Rhino form as the boss of the game&#x27;s final level, appeared in the 2012 Disney film &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot;, along with &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; villain Doctor Eggman.

==Competition==
On October 31, 2019, ZeeGee_ of New York achieved the world record for fastest speedrun at 6 minutes 10 seconds on the Sega Genesis, while thu_ox placed second with 6 minutes 12 seconds on the Nintendo Wii. Apostle Studios achieved the world record of highest score with 6,621,500 on the Sega Genesis, while Samuel Clemens of California placed second with 1,008,300 points on July 19, 2022, on the PlayStation 4.

<doc id="592213" wikidata="Q677840" url="?curid=592213" title="Comet West">
<text>Comet West, formally designated C/1975 V1, 1976 VI, and 1975n, was a comet described as one of the brightest objects to pass through the inner Solar System in 1976. It is often described as a &quot;great comet.&quot;

== History ==
It was discovered photographically by Richard M. West, of the European Southern Observatory, on August 10, 1975. The comet came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on February 25, 1976. During perihelion the comet had a minimum solar elongation of 6.4° and as a result of forward scattering reached a peak apparent magnitude of −3. From February 2527, observers reported that the comet was bright enough to study during full daylight.

Despite its brightness, Comet West went largely unreported in the popular media. This was partly due to the relatively disappointing display of Comet Kohoutek in 1973, which had been widely predicted to become extremely prominent: scientists were wary of making predictions that might raise public expectations.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, reported on March 2, 1976 that West was &quot;a comet that may prove one of the brightest in this decade&quot; and would be &quot;visible to the unaided eye.&quot;

==Period==
With a nearly parabolic trajectory, estimates for the orbital period of this comet have varied from 254,000 to 558,000 years. Computing the best-fit orbit for this long-period comet is made more difficult since it underwent a splitting event which may have caused a non-gravitational perturbation of the orbit. The 2008 SAO Catalog of Cometary Orbits shows 195 observations for C/1975 V1 and 135 for C/1975 V1-A, for a combined total of 330 (218 observations were used in the fit).

== Breakup ==
Before the perihelion passage, and using 28 positions obtained between 1975 August 10 and 1976 January 27, Comet West was estimated to have an orbital period of about 254,000 years. As the comet passed within 30 million km of the Sun, the nucleus was observed to split into four fragments.

The first report of the split came around 7 March 1976 12:30UT, when reports were received that the comet had broken into two pieces. Astronomer Steven O&#x27;Meara, using the 9-inch Harvard Refractor, reported that two additional fragments had formed on the morning of 18 March.

The fragmentation of the nucleus was, at the time, one of very few comet breakups observed, one of the most notable previous examples being the Great Comet of 1882, a member of the Kreutz Sungrazing &#x27;family&#x27; of comets. More recently, comets Schwassmann-Wachmann-3 (73P), C/1999 S4 LINEAR, and 57P/du Toit-Neujmin-Delporte, have been observed to split or disintegrate during their passage close to the Sun.

The comet has been more than from the Sun since 2003.

== Nomenclature ==
In the nomenclature of the time, it was known as &quot;Comet 1976 VI&quot; or &quot;Comet 1975n&quot;, but the modern nomenclature is &quot;C/1975 V1&quot;. (Note that &quot;1976 VI&quot; uses the Roman numeral VI = 6, while &quot;C/1975 V1&quot; is the letter V and the number 1).

<doc id="592219" wikidata="Q5498020" url="?curid=592219" title="Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol">
<text>Frederick William Augustus Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol (born 19 October 1979), is a British peer. 

After managing a Baltic property fund, based in Estonia, he is currently the chairman of Bristol Estates.

As Marquess of Bristol, he was a hereditary member of the House of Lords in 1999. He is also High Steward of the Liberty of St Edmund, which encompasses the whole former county of West Suffolk.

== Early life==
Bristol is the only son of the late 6th Marquess by his third wife, the former Yvonne Sutton. His godparents include King Fuad II and his former wife, Queen Fadila of Egypt, Prince Tomislav of Yugoslavia, Prince Nikita Romanoff of Russia, and the Countess of Dundonald. He is the brother of Lady Victoria Hervey (born 1976) and Lady Isabella Hervey (born 1982).

He was educated at St Maur School in Monaco, Sunningdale School, Eton College, and the University of Edinburgh, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree.

He became heir to his elder half-brother the 7th Marquess in January 1998, on the death of his older half-brother Lord Nicholas Hervey, and succeeded to the peerages in January 1999, becoming Marquess and Earl of Bristol, Earl Jermyn of Horningsheath, and 13th Baron Hervey of Ickworth. He served briefly as a member of the House of Lords until the House of Lords Act 1999 came into effect in November.

==Business career==
After graduating from Edinburgh in 2002, Lord Bristol went to live in Estonia, where for seven years he managed a Baltic property fund. He is currently the chairman of Bristol Estates, a company which owns historic property interests in Horringer, Suffolk, Great Chesterford, Essex, Sleaford, Lincolnshire, and in Kemptown, Brighton.

==Public life==
Bristol is patron of several organisations, including the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust; the Athenaeum, Bury St Edmunds; and the Friends of West Suffolk Hospital. He is Vice President of Friends of the Suffolk Record Office, Trustee of General Sir William Hervey&#x27;s Charitable Trust, and founder, Trustee, and Chairman of the Ickworth Church Conservation Trust.

He is also Hereditary High Steward of the Liberty of St Edmund.

== Ickworth House and Church==
In 1998, the 7th Marquess sold his lease to occupy the East Wing of Ickworth House, the family seat since the 15th century. After his brother&#x27;s death on 10 January 1999, the 8th Marquess vigorously criticised the National Trust for not being willing to sell him what would have been the remaining term of that lease, arguing that the 7th Marquess could only sell his own life interest, and not that of his successors. This was disputed by the National Trust, which by 2001 had converted the East Wing into a hotel. However, in 2009, Sir Simon Jenkins, the National Trust&#x27;s new chairman, stated, &quot;I think it is in our interest for the Marquesses of Bristol to be living there&quot;.

In 2005, Lord Bristol created the Ickworth Church Conservation Trust, to safeguard the future of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ickworth, and transferred ownership of the Church from himself to the Trust. He later led a restoration project and sourced the £1.2m required to restore the building. He remains as Chairman and Trustee of the ICCT, which now owns and manages the Church.

==Private life==
In 2011, Bristol was romantically linked to the fashion model Alana Bunte.

On 11 May 2018, Lord Bristol married Meredith Dunn, an American art consultant, in a Roman Catholic wedding at the Brompton Oratory. They have a daughter, Lady Arabella Prudence Morley Hervey, born on 8 March 2020 and baptised as a Roman Catholic and a son, Frederick William Herbert Morley Hervey, Earl Jermyn, born on 25 July 2022.

<text>Denis-Antoine-Luc, comte de Frayssinous (9 May 176512 December 1841) was a French prelate and statesman, orator and writer. He was the eighth member elected to occupy Seat 3 of the Académie Française in 1822.

==Biography==
De Frayssinous was born of humble parentage at Curières, in the &quot;département&quot; of Aveyron. He owes his reputation mainly to the lectures on dogmatic theology, known as the conferences of Saint Sulpice, delivered in the church of Saint Sulpice, Paris, from 1803 to 1809, to which admiring crowds were attracted by his lucid exposition and by his graceful oratory. The freedom of his language in 1809, when Napoleon had arrested the pope and declared the annexation of Rome to France, led to a prohibition of his lectures; and the dispersion of the congregation of Saint Sulpice in 1811 was followed by his temporary retirement from the capital. He returned with the Bourbons, and resumed his lectures in 1814; but the events of the Hundred Days again compelled him to withdraw into private life, from which he did not emerge until February 1816.

As court preacher and almoner to Louis XVIII of France, he now entered upon the period of his greatest public activity and influence. In connection with the controversy raised by the signing of the reactionary concordat of 1817, he published in 1818 a treatise entitled &quot;Les vrais principes de l&#x27;Église gallicane sur la puissance ecclésiastique&quot;, which though unfavourably criticized by Lamennais, was received with favor by the civil and ecclesiastical authorities.

The consecration of Frayssinous as bishop of Hermopolis &quot;in partibus&quot;, his election to the Académie française, and his appointment to the grand-mastership of the university, followed in rapid succession. In 1824, on the accession of Charles X of France, he became minister of public instruction and of ecclesiastical affairs under the administration of Jean-Baptiste, Comte de Villèle; and about the same time he was created a peer of France with the title of count. His term of office was chiefly marked by the recall of the Jesuits.

In 1825 he published his lectures under the title &quot;Défense du christianisme&quot;. The work passed through 15 editions within 18 years, and was translated into several European languages. In 1828 he, along with his colleagues in the Villèle ministry, was compelled to resign office, and the subsequent revolution of July 1830 led to his retirement to Rome. Shortly afterwards he became tutor to the duke of Bordeaux (Comte de Chambord) at Prague, where he continued to live until 1838. He died at Saint-Geniez-d&#x27;Olt on 12 December 1841.

==Literary quotations==

The famous novel of Gustave Flaubert, Madame Bovary, mentions the Conferences of Saint Sulpice by the abbot Frayssinous, habitual readings during the stay of Emma Rouault (not yet Bovary) in a nunnery.

<text>4660 Nereus, provisional designation 1982 DB, is a small (about ) asteroid. It was discovered by Eleanor F. Helin on 28 February 1982, approximately a month after it passed from Earth.

Nereus is potentially an important asteroid with a high albedo. It is an Apollo and Mars-crosser, with an orbit that frequently comes close to Earth, and because of this it is exceptionally accessible to spacecraft. Indeed, because of its small size and close orbit, its delta-V for rendezvous of ~5 km/s is smaller than the Moon&#x27;s, which is about 6.3 km/s.

Nereus makes seven approaches to Earth of less than 5 million km between 1900 and 2100. The closest will be on 14 February 2060, at 1.2 million km. The most recent closest approach was on 11 December 2021, when it was 3.9 million km away. During the 2021 approach, the asteroid peaked around apparent magnitude 12.6, requiring a telescope with around a 100mm objective lens to be visually seen. Its orbital period of 1.82 yr also puts it somewhat near a 2:1 orbital resonance with Earth, which means that an approximately 4-year mission could depart for and return from the asteroid on relatively near passes to the Earth.

Nereus is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA), due to both its absolute magnitude and its minimum orbit intersection distance .

The asteroid is classified as E-type, so it could be potentially associated with aubrite meteorites (enstatite achondrites).

==Name==
Although the discoverer is given the opportunity to name the asteroid, Helin donated naming rights to the Planetary Society which organized a naming contest. The winner, Robert M. Cutler, then an employee of NASA contractor The MITRE Corporation, named the asteroid after the ancient Greek proto-god Nereus who had characteristics later attributed to Apollo (prophecy) and Poseidon (a sea god similar to Nereus but with legs rather than a fish tail).

==Physical characteristics==

Nereus has been imaged by radar, revealing a slightly elongated shape which would allow for stable orbits around it. Earlier optical measurements had given an estimated diameter of about meters. More recent work on the analysis of the radar data gives a much more detailed shape for Nereus as well as a fairly detailed terrain map of the surface.

Nereus has a generally ellipsoidal shape with dimensions of . On the ends of its longest axis, one end appears narrower and rounder than the other, larger end, making it more of an egg shape. The larger end also appears to have a flatter region on one side of it. Nereus rotates about an axis roughly perpendicular to its longest axis much like a silver spoon spinning on a table.

== Exploration ==

Nereus was proposed for visitation by both the private Near Earth Asteroid Prospector (NEAP) probe, and the Japanese sample return mission Hayabusa. However, the NEAP probe was not realized, and the Hayabusa&#x27;s launch was delayed by 10 months and the probe had to be redirected to 25143 Itokawa.

4660 Nereus was considered as a flyby target of the NEAR robotic spacecraft mission. NEAR was eventually launched, but visited 253 Mathilde and 433 Eros.

<doc id="592228" wikidata="Q702931" url="?curid=592228" title="Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)">
<text>The Congress of Aachen () was assembled on 24 April 1748 in the Imperial Free City of Aachen, in the west of the Holy Roman Empire, to conclude the struggle known as the War of Austrian Succession. Between 30 April and 21 May the preliminaries were agreed to between Great Britain, France, the Dutch Republic, and Maria Theresa, queen of Bohemia and Hungary. The king of Sardinia, Ferdinand VI of Spain, the duke of Modena, and the Republic of Genoa successively gave their adhesion. The definitive treaty was signed on the 18th of October, Sardinia alone refusing to accede, because the Treaty of Worms was not guaranteed.

== Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ==
Of the provisions of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, the most important were those stipulating for:
#a general restitution of conquests, including Cape Breton Island to France, Madras to England and the barrier towns to the Dutch
#the assignment to Don Philip of the duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla
#the restoration of the duke of Modena and the republic of Genoa to their former positions
#the renewal in favour of Great Britain of the Asiento contract of 16 March 1713, and of the right to send an annual vessel to the Spanish colonies
#the renewal of the article of the treaty of 1718 recognizing the Protestant succession in the English throne
#the recognition of the emperor Francis and the confirmation of the pragmatic sanction, i.e. of the right of Maria Theresa to the Habsburg succession
#the guarantee to Prussia of the duchy of Silesia and the county of Glatz.

== Changes to the treaty ==
Spain having raised objections to the Asiento clauses, the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was supplemented by the Treaty of Madrid on the 5th of October, 1750, by which Great Britain surrendered her claims under those clauses in return for a sum of £100,000.

<doc id="592234" wikidata="Q289113" url="?curid=592234" title="Étienne-Denis Pasquier">
<text>Étienne-Denis, duc de Pasquier (21 April 17675 July 1862), &quot;Chancelier de France&quot;, (a title revived for him by Louis-Philippe in 1837), was a French statesman. In 1842, he was elected a member of the Académie française, and in the same year was created a duke by Louis-Philippe.

==Biography==
Born in Paris in a family of the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot;, with ancestors such as Étienne Pasquier, he was destined for the legal profession and was educated at the &quot;Collège de Juilly&quot; near Paris. He then became a counsellor of the &quot;parlement de Paris&quot;, and witnessed many of the incidents that marked the growing hostility between that body and Louis XVI of France in the years preceding the French Revolution of 1789.

His views were those of a moderate reformer, determined to preserve the House of Bourbon in a renovated France; his memoirs depict in a favorable light the actions of his (an institution soon to be abolished towards the end of the year 1789, under growing revolutionary pressures).

For some time, and especially during the Reign of Terror (1793–1794), Pasquier remained in obscurity; but this did not save him from arrest nor his father from execution in the year 1794. He was incarcerated for two months in the Saint-Lazare Prison shortly before the start of Thermidorian Reaction, and released after the fall and execution of Maximilien Robespierre at the end of July 1794.

==Empire==
He did not re-enter the public service until the period of the First French Empire, when the arch-chancellor Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès used his influence with Napoleon I to procure for him the office of &quot;maître des requêtes&quot; to the Conseil d&#x27;État. In 1809, he became baron of the Empire, and in February 1810 counsellor of State. In October 1810, the Emperor made him prefect of police of Paris.

The main challenge of his career was the strange conspiracy of the republican general Claude François de Malet (October 1812); Malet, spreading false news that Napoleon had died in the Russian campaign, managed to surprise and capture some of the ministers and other authorities in Paris, among them Pasquier. However, the attempt&#x27;s manifest failure enabled Pasquier to speedily regain his liberty.

==Restoration and July Monarchy==
When Napoleon abdicated in April 1814, Pasquier continued to exercise his functions for a few days in order to preserve order, and then resigned from the prefecture of police, whereupon Louis XVIII of France allotted to him the &quot;Corps des Ponts et Chaussées&quot;. He distanced himself from the Imperial restoration at the time of the Hundred Days (1815), and, after the final Bourbon Restoration, became Keeper of the Seal (July 1815). Finding it impossible to work with the Ultra-royalists of the Chamber of Deputies (the &quot;Chambre introuvable&quot;), he resigned office in September. Under the more moderate ministers of succeeding years, he again held various appointments, but refused to join the reactionary cabinets of the close of the reign of Charles X of France.

After the July Revolution (1830), he became president of the Chamber of Peers, a post which he held through the whole of the reign of Louis-Philippe (1830–1848). After the abdication of Louis-Philippe in February 1848, &quot;Chancelier Pasquier&quot; retired from active life and set to work to compile the notes and reminiscences of his long and active career. He died in Paris at the age of ninety-five on 5 July 1862.

<text>Jacques Maritain (; 18 November 1882 – 28 April 1973) was a French Catholic philosopher. Raised as a Protestant, he was agnostic before converting to Catholicism in 1906. An author of more than 60 books, he helped to revive Thomas Aquinas for modern times, and was influential in the development and drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pope Paul VI presented his &quot;Message to Men of Thought and of Science&quot; at the close of Vatican II to Maritain, his long-time friend and mentor. The same pope had seriously considered making him a lay cardinal, but Maritain rejected it. Maritain&#x27;s interest and works spanned many aspects of philosophy, including aesthetics, political theory, philosophy of science, metaphysics, the nature of education, liturgy and ecclesiology.

==Life==
Maritain was born in Paris, the son of Paul Maritain, who was a lawyer, and his wife Geneviève Favre, the daughter of philosopher and educator Julie Favre and statesman and lawyer Jules Favre. His niece was librarian and Resistance member Éveline Garnier, who he later made his principal legatee and introduced to her life partner Andrée Jacob. Maritain was reared in a liberal Protestant milieu. He was sent to the Lycée Henri-IV. Later, he attended the Sorbonne, studying the natural sciences: chemistry, biology and physics. At the Sorbonne, he met Raïssa Oumançoff, a Russian Jewish émigré. They married in 1904, but they made a private vow to abstain from sex.

A noted poet and mystic, Raïssa participated as his intellectual partner in his search for truth. Raïssa&#x27;s sister, Vera Oumançoff, lived with Jacques and Raïssa for almost all their married life. At the Sorbonne, Jacques and Raïssa soon became disenchanted with scientism, which could not, in their view, address the larger existential issues of life. In 1901, in light of this disillusionment, they made a pact to commit suicide together if they could not discover some deeper meaning to life within a year. They were spared from following through on this because, at the urging of Charles Péguy, they attended the lectures of Henri Bergson at the Collège de France. Bergson&#x27;s critique of scientism dissolved their intellectual despair and instilled in them &quot;the sense of the absolute.&quot; Then, through the influence of Léon Bloy, they converted to the Catholic faith in 1906.

In the fall of 1907, the Maritains moved to Heidelberg, where Jacques studied biology under Hans Driesch. Hans Driesch&#x27;s theory of neo-vitalism attracted Jacques because of its affinity with Henri Bergson. During this time, Raïssa fell ill, and during her convalescence, their spiritual advisor, a Dominican friar named Humbert Clérissac, introduced her to the writings of Thomas Aquinas. She read them with enthusiasm and, in turn, exhorted her husband to examine the saint&#x27;s writings. In Thomas, Maritain found a number of insights and ideas that he had believed all along. He wrote:
Thenceforth, in affirming to myself, without chicanery or diminution, the authentic value of the reality of our human instruments of knowledge, I was already a Thomist without knowing it ... When several months later I came to the &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot;, I would construct no impediment to its luminous flood.

From the Angelic Doctor (the honorary title of Aquinas), he was led to &quot;The Philosopher&quot;, as Aquinas called Aristotle. Still later, to further his intellectual development, he read the neo-Thomists. Beginning in 1912, Maritain taught at the Collège Stanislas. He later moved to the Institut Catholique de Paris. For the 1916–1917 academic year, he taught at the Petit Séminaire de Versailles. In 1930 Maritain and Étienne Gilson received honorary doctorates in philosophy from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;.

In 1933, Maritain gave his first lectures in North America in Toronto at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. He also taught at Columbia University; at the Committee on Social Thought, University of Chicago; at the University of Notre Dame, and at Princeton University. From 1945 to 1948, he was the French ambassador to the Holy See. Afterwards, Maritain returned to Princeton University. In 1952, he gave the inaugural A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts. Four years later, he achieved the &quot;Elysian status&quot; (as he put it) of a professor emeritus. Raïssa Maritain died in 1960. After her death, Jacques published her journal under the title &quot;Raïssa&#x27;s Journal.&quot; For several years Maritain was an honorary chairman of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, appearing as a keynote speaker at its 1960 conference in Berlin.

From 1961, Maritain lived with the Little Brothers of Jesus in Toulouse, France. He had an influence on the order since its foundation in 1933 and became a Little Brother in 1970. Maritain was also an oblate for the Order of Saint Benedict. In a 1938 interview published by the &quot;Commonweal&quot; magazine, they asked if he was a freemason. Maritain replied:That question offends me, for I should have a horror of belonging to Freemasonry. So much the worse for well-intentioned people whose anxiety and need for explanations would have been satisfied by believing me to be one.Jacques and Raïssa Maritain are buried in the cemetery of Kolbsheim, a little French village in Alsace where he had spent many summers at the estate of his friends, Antoinette and Alexander Grunelius.

==Work==
The foundation of Maritain&#x27;s thought is Aristotle, Aquinas, and the Thomistic commentators, especially John of St. Thomas. He is eclectic in his use of these sources. Maritain&#x27;s philosophy is based on evidence accrued by the senses and acquired by an understanding of first principles. Maritain defended philosophy as a science against those who would degrade it, and promoted philosophy as the &quot;queen of sciences&quot;. In 1910, Jacques Maritain completed his first contribution to modern philosophy, a 28-page article titled, &quot;Reason and Modern Science&quot; published in &quot;Revue de Philosophie&quot; (June issue). In it, he warned that science was becoming a divinity, its methodology usurping the role of reason and philosophy, supplanting the humanities.

In 1917, a committee of French bishops commissioned Jacques to write a series of textbooks to be used in Catholic colleges and seminaries. He wrote and completed only one of these projects, titled &quot;Elements de Philosophie&quot; (Introduction of Philosophy) in 1920. It has been a standard text ever since in many Catholic seminaries. He wrote in his introduction:
If the philosophy of Aristotle, as revived and enriched by Thomas Aquinas and his school, may rightly be called the Christian philosophy, both because the church is never weary of putting it forward as the only true philosophy and because it harmonizes perfectly with the truths of faith, nevertheless it is proposed here for the reader&#x27;s acceptance not because it is Christian, but because it is demonstrably true. This agreement between a philosophic system founded by a pagan and the dogmas of revelation is no doubt an external sign, an extra-philosophic guarantee of its truth; but from its own rational evidence, it derives its authority as a philosophy.

During the Second World War, Jacques Maritain protested the policies of the Vichy government while teaching at the Pontifical Institute for Medieval Studies in Canada. &quot;Moving to New York, Maritain became deeply involved in rescue activities, seeking to bring persecuted and threatened academics, many of them Jews, to America. He was instrumental in founding the École Libre des Hautes Études, a kind of university in exile that was, at the same time, the centre of Gaullist resistance in the United States&quot;. After the war, in a papal audience on 16 July 1946, he tried unsuccessfully to have Pope Pius XII officially denounce antisemitism.

Many of his American papers are held by the University of Notre Dame, which established The Jacques Maritain Center in 1957. The Cercle d&#x27;Etudes Jacques &amp; Raïssa Maritain is an association founded by the philosopher himself in 1962 in Kolbsheim (near Strasbourg, France), where the couple is also buried. The purpose of these centres is to encourage study and research of Maritain&#x27;s thoughts and expand upon them. It is also absorbed in translating and editing his writings.

==Metaphysics and epistemology==
Maritain&#x27;s philosophy is based on the view that metaphysics is prior to epistemology. Being is first apprehended implicitly in sense experience, and is known in two ways. First, being is known reflexively by abstraction from sense experience. One experiences a particular being, e.g. a cup, a dog, etc. and through reflection (&quot;bending back&quot;) on the judgement, e.g. &quot;this is a dog&quot;, one recognizes that the object in question is an existent. Second, in light of attaining being reflexively through apprehension of sense experience, one may arrive at what Maritain calls &quot;an Intuition of Being&quot;. For Maritain this is the point of departure for metaphysics; without the intuition of being one cannot be a metaphysician at all. The intuition of being involves rising to the apprehension of &quot;ens secundum quod est ens&quot; (being insofar as it is a being). In &quot;Existence and the Existent&quot;, he explains:

&quot;It is being, attained or perceived at the summit of an abstractive intellection, of an eidetic or intensive visualization which owes its purity and power of illumination only to the fact that the intellect, one day, was stirred to its depths and trans-illuminated by the impact of the act of existing apprehended in things, and because it was quickened to the point of receiving this act, or hearkening to it, within itself, in the intelligible and super-intelligible integrity of the tone particular to it.&quot; (p. 20)

In view of this priority given to metaphysics, Maritain advocates an epistemology he calls &quot;Critical Realism&quot;. Maritain&#x27;s epistemology is not &quot;critical&quot; in Kant&#x27;s sense, which held that one could only know anything after undertaking a thorough critique of one&#x27;s cognitive abilities. Rather, it is critical in the sense that it is not a naive or non-philosophical realism, but one that is defended by way of reason. Against Kant&#x27;s critical project, Maritain argues that epistemology is reflexive; you can only defend a theory of knowledge in light of knowledge you have already attained. Consequently, the critical question is not the question of modern philosophyhow do we pass from what is perceived to what is? Rather, &quot;Since the mind, from the very start, reveals itself as warranted in its certitude by things and measured by an esse [the Latin verb &#x27;to be&#x27;, Aquinas&#x27; preferred term for &#x27;existence&#x27;], independent of itself, how are we to judge if, how, on what conditions, and to what extent it is so both in principle and in the various moments of knowledge?&quot;

In contrast, idealism inevitably ends up in contradiction, since it does not recognize the universal scope of the first principles of identity, contradiction, and finality. These become merely laws of thought or language, but not of being, which opens the way to contradictions being instantiated in reality. Maritain&#x27;s metaphysics ascends from this account of being to a critique of the philosophical aspects of modern science, through analogy to an account of the existence and nature of God as it is known philosophically and through mystical experience.

==Ethics==
Maritain was a strong defender of a natural law ethics. He viewed ethical norms as being rooted in human nature. For Maritain, the natural law is known primarily, not through philosophical argument and demonstration, but rather through &quot;Connaturality&quot;. Connatural knowledge is a kind of knowledge by acquaintance. We know the natural law through our direct acquaintance with it in our human experience. Of central importance, is Maritain&#x27;s argument that natural rights are rooted in the natural law. This was key to his involvement in the drafting of the UN&#x27;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Another important aspect of his ethics was his insistence upon the need for moral philosophy to be conducted in a theological context. While a Christian could engage in speculative thought about nature or metaphysics in a purely rational manner and develop an adequate philosophy of nature of metaphysics, this is not possible with ethics. Moral philosophy must address the actual state of the human person, and this is a person in a state of grace. Thus, &quot;moral philosophy adequately considered&quot; must take into account properly theological truths. It would be impossible, for instance, to develop an adequate moral philosophy without giving consideration to proper theological facts such as original sin and the supernatural end of the human person in beatitude. Any moral philosophy that does not take into account these realities that are only known through faith would be fundamentally incomplete.

==Political theory==
Maritain corresponded with, and was a friend of, the American radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, as well as French Prime Minister Robert Schuman. In the study &quot;The Radical Vision of Saul Alinsky&quot;, author P. David Finks noted that &quot;For years Jacques Maritain had spoken approvingly to Montini of the democratic community organizations built by Saul Alinsky&quot;. Accordingly, in 1958 Maritain arranged for a series of meetings between Alinsky and Archbishop Montini in Milan. Before the meetings, Maritain had written to Alinsky: &quot;the new cardinal was reading Saul’s books and would contact him soon&quot;.

===Integral Humanism===
Maritain advocated what he called &quot;Integral Humanism&quot; (or &quot;Integral Christian Humanism&quot;). He argued that secular forms of humanism were inevitably anti-human in that they refused to recognize the whole person. Once the spiritual dimension of human nature is rejected, we no longer have an integral, but merely partial humanism, one which rejects a fundamental aspect of the human person. Accordingly, in &quot;Integral Humanism&quot; he explores the prospects for a new Christendom, rooted in his philosophical pluralism, in order to find ways Christianity could inform political discourse and policy in a pluralistic age. In this account he develops a theory of cooperation, to show how people of different intellectual positions can nevertheless cooperate to achieve common practical aims. Maritain&#x27;s political theory was extremely influential and was a primary source behind the Christian Democratic movement.

=== Global policy ===
Along with Albert Einstein, Maritain was one of the sponsors of the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples&#x27; World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place in 1950–51 at Palais Electoral, Geneva, Switzerland.

==Legacy==

===Praise===
Citing the Integral humanism of Jacques Maritain&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;humanisme intégral&quot;, Pope Paul VI declared in &quot;Populorum progressio&quot; that the &quot;ultimate goal is a full-bodied humanism&quot;. Senator John F. Kennedy (later President of the United States), once quoted Maritain in a 1955 address to Assumption College. President Joe Biden has cited Maritain as immensely influential in his thinking. In an interview from 2016, Pope Francis praised Maritain among a small list of French liberal thinkers.

===Criticism===
Major criticisms of Maritain have included: 
#Spanish Dominican theologian Santiago Ramírez argued that Maritain&#x27;s moral philosophy, adequately considered, could not be distinguished in any meaningful way from moral theology as such. 
#Tracey Rowland, a theologian at the University of Notre Dame (Australia), has argued that the lack of a fully developed philosophy of culture in Maritain and others (notably Rahner) was responsible for an inadequate notion of culture in the documents of Vatican II and thereby for much of the misapplication of the conciliar texts in the life of the church following the council.
#Maritain&#x27;s political theory has been criticized for a democratic pluralism that appeals to something very similar to the later liberal philosopher John Rawls&#x27; conception of an overlapping consensus of reasonable views. It is argued that such a view illegitimately presupposes the necessity of pluralistic conceptions of the human good.

Catholic philosopher and historian Thomas Molnar, who praised Maritain as &quot;a man of charity&quot;, also wrote that Maritain&#x27;s work contained &quot;baffling paradoxes&quot;. Molnar said that while Maritain&#x27;s philosophy was &quot;Orthodox and Thomist&quot;, he nonetheless unfortunately had &quot;occasional excursions into strange semi-spiritual lands.&quot; Catholic political theorist Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn wrote that &quot;Maritain knew a lot about theology, he was a philosopher, and he knew something about biology, but he knew next to nothing about politics and economics.&quot; Catholic philosopher Alice von Hildebrand referred to Maritain as &quot;treasonous&quot; and criticized his negative views on Engelbert Dollfuss, whom Maritain had spoken of positively in the past, but later became critical of.

===Veneration===
A cause for beatification of him and his wife Raïssa was being planned in 2011. Since then, there have been no advancements in the case.

<doc id="592245" wikidata="Q8039432" url="?curid=592245" title="Www.pitchshifter.com">
<text>www.pitchshifter.com is the fourth album by the British industrial metal band Pitchshifter. It was released in the United Kingdom by Geffen Records on 2 March 1998, and in the United States by DGC Records on 7 April 1998. The record, which was their first released through a major label, sold just over 60,000 copies in the US alone—selling nearly twice as much as the group&#x27;s proceeding album &quot;Deviant&quot; did (which sold 33,000 copies).

The album&#x27;s name comes from the band&#x27;s domain name–a relative novelty at the time of the release. The domain name registration was eventually lapsed; JS Clayden said &quot;we carried the website for such a long time that it felt like a burden being lifted to let it go&quot;.

Multiple songs from &quot;www.pitchshifter.com&quot; were included on the vehicular-based PlayStation games &quot;Twisted Metal 3 and &quot;Test Drive 5&quot;.

== Reception ==
In 2005, &quot;Rock Hard&quot; placed &quot;www.pitchshifter.com&quot; at number 263 on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. Also in 2005, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked the album as the 45th greatest British rock album of all time. In 2016, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; named it the 10th best industrial metal album.

<text>The Battle of Reichenberg took place during the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War) on 21 April 1757 near the town of Reichenberg (Czech: &quot;Liberec&quot;) in Bohemia.

== Background ==
Marshal von Bevern had entered Bohemia with a corps of 15,000 Prussians. At Reichenberg he encountered Königsegg&#x27;s Austrian corps. The full Austrian corps consisted of 18,000 infantry and 4,900 cavalry, but only about 14,000 of them had been concentrated at Reichenberg.

The experienced Bevern defeated his opponent. As a result, Bevern captured large quantities of Austrian supplies and could continue his march on Prague.

<text>Deviant is the fifth album by the British industrial metal band Pitchshifter, released in 2000. It was a follow-up to the commercially successful album &quot;www.pitchshifter.com&quot;, but was seen by the record label as a disappointment. Promotional videos by DOSE Productions were made for the tracks &quot;Hidden Agenda&quot; and &quot;Dead Battery&quot;. The track &quot;Everything&#x27;s Fucked&quot; was originally released as &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;. Jello Biafra makes an appearance on the track &quot;As Seen on TV&quot;. By March 2002, the album had sold 33,000 copies in the U.S., just over half the amount &quot;www.pitchshifter.com&quot; had sold at the same time.

Before &quot;Deviant&quot; was released, a promotional sampler CD was released under the name &#x27;Deviant Sampler&#x27;.

== Track listing ==
== Album cover ==
Pitchshifter&#x27;s album cover used a picture of a painting by Gee Vaucher, who did artwork for Crass and Carcass. The painting shows a cross between the Pope John Paul II and Queen Elizabeth II. The album cover was banned in Poland, due to some of the public&#x27;s response and complaints deeming the image offensive and insulting to the Pope. The band and MCA Records apologized and changed the artwork.

<doc id="592263" wikidata="Q1364466" url="?curid=592263" title="Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque">
<text>The Metropolitan Archdiocese of Dubuque () is a Latin Church ecclesiastical territory, or archdiocese, of the Catholic Church in the northeastern quarter of the state of Iowa in the United States.

The Diocese of Dubuque was erected in 1837 and elevated to an archdiocese in 1893. It is a metropolitan archdiocese with three suffragan dioceses:

* Diocese of Davenport
* Diocese of Des Moines
* Diocese of Sioux City

==Territory and personnel==
The seat of the archdiocese is St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral in Dubuque, named in honor of the Archangel Raphael. As of 2024, the archbishop is Thomas Zinkula.

The archdiocese is one of a few American archdioceses that is not based in a major metropolitan area. It includes all the Iowa counties north of Polk, Jasper, Poweshiek, Iowa, Johnson, Cedar, and Clinton counties, and east of Kossuth, Humboldt, Webster and Boone counties. It has an area of approximately .

As of 2023, the archdiocese had 173 priests and 143 permanent deacons serving 163 parishes divided into eight deaneries. The archdiocese had a Catholic population of approximately 183,700.

==History==
===1673 to 1837===
The first Catholic presence in present-day Iowa was that of the French Jesuit missionary, Reverend Jacques Marquette. He traveled down the Mississippi River with the French explorer Louis Jolliet in 1673, stopping briefly at what is now Montrose in southern Iowa. The region would be under French and Spanish control for the next 131 years.

After the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, the Iowa region passed from French to American control. The few Catholics in the area were originally under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas. In 1826, the Vatican transferred the Iowa region to the new Diocese of St. Louis. It would remain under this jurisdiction for the next 11 years.

The earliest Catholic settlers in the Iowa region were French-Canadian, German, and Irish. With the growth of the Catholic population, Bishop Joseph Rosati of St. Louis sent the Belgian Jesuit Reverend Charles Van Quickenborne to the newly founded Dubuque in 1833, where he organized the first parish. He was followed in 1834 by Reverend Charles Fitzmaurice, who began amassing funds to construct a church. When Fitzmaurice died of cholera in early 1835, Rosatis sent the Dominican Reverend Samuel Mazzuchelli to replace him.

Mazzuchelli ministered to a scattered Catholic population of under 3,000. In 1835, he dedicated the first church in the present day archdiocese, which he named St. Raphael.

=== 1837 to 1850 ===

Pope Gregory XVI erected the Diocese of Dubuque on July 28, 1837, and named Monsignor Mathias Loras from the Diocese of Mobile as its first bishop. This vast diocese covered the entire Iowa Territory along with what became the Minnesota Territory (including the Dakotas).

Gathering funds and personnel in Alabama, Loras arrived in Dubuque in 1839. He designated St. Raphael as the cathedral parish later that year. That same year, he establish St. Raphael Seminary in Dubuque, which in later years would become Loras College. Loras encouraged immigration to the area, especially German and Irish settlers.

Loras invited several religious orders to the diocese. In 1843, while visiting Baltimore, Loras met with several Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He convinced them to come to Dubuque, where they founded St. Joseph&#x27;s Academy for girls. It became Clarke University in 1881. In 1849, with Ireland ravaged by the Great Famine, several Irish Cistercians immigrated to Iowa to build the New Melleray Abbey in Peosta.

=== 1850 to 1865 ===

In 1850, Pope Pius IX separated the Minnesota Territory from the Diocese of Dubuque to form the new Diocese of St. Paul. On January 9, 1857, at Loras&#x27;s request, Pius IX appointed Reverend Clement Smyth, a Trappist priest, to assist Loras as a coadjutor bishop. In early 1858, Loras started the construction of the current St. Raphael&#x27;s Cathedral. When Loras died on February 19, 1958, Smyth automatically succeeded him as the second bishop of Dubuque.

As the diocese expanded, Smyth successfully recruited Irish priests to the diocese, primarily from All Hallows College in Dublin. This caused discontent among the French-born priests in Dubuque, with many of them transferring to other dioceses. In 1863, Smyth consecrated Ephraim McDonnell as the first abbot for New Melleray after the Vatican elevated to an abbey. During his episcopacy the German Catholics in Dubuque began construction of a new St. Mary&#x27;s church to replace the Church of the Holy Trinity.

In 1863, during the American Civil War, Smyth learned about a branch of the Knights of the Golden Circle (KCG) in Dubuque, a secret paramilitary society with sympathies for the Confederate South. Smyth told Catholic members of KCG to either quit the organization or be excommunicated. Smyth preached a stinging sermon after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 15, 1865. That evening, an arsonist set fire to Smyth&#x27;s carriage house, killing his horses and destroying his carriage and the structure.

=== 1865 to 1893 ===

Smyth died in 1865. On April 24, 1866, Pius IX appointed Reverend John Hennessey of Saint Louis as the third bishop of Dubuque. When he arrived in Dubuque, there were 27 priests, 30 churches, two schools and seven sisters.

During Hennessy&#x27;s tenure, the population of Dubuque exploded as the Milwaukee Railroad opened a maintenance center in the city. Hennessey erected Sacred Heart, Holy Ghost, St. Anthony&#x27;s, and Holy Trinity Parishes in Dubuque to deal with this population increase. In 1871, Nicholas E. Gonner, a Catholic immigrant from Luxembourg, founded the Catholic Printing Company in Dubuque, That same year, he started publishing the German language &quot;Luxemburger Gazette&quot;. In 1878, the Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis of the Holy Family relocated from Iowa City to Dubuque to staff St. Mary&#x27;s Orphan Home.

Hennessy was a strong proponent of Catholic education, terming public schools as &quot;dens of iniquity&quot; and &quot;gates of hell&quot;.

Both Smyth and Hennessy believed that the diocese was becoming too big and should be split up. He proposed that the Vatican erect a new diocese in southern Iowa based in Des Moines. However, in 1881, Pope Leo XIII instead erected the Diocese of Davenport in southern Iowa.

By 1891, the diocese had 203 priests, 319 churches, 615 sisters, and over 135 parochial schools with 16,257 students.

=== 1893 to 1944 ===

On June 15, 1893, Pope Leo XIII elevated the Diocese of Dubuque to the Archdiocese of Dubuque and Hennessey became the first archbishop. Hennessey died in 1900 and was buried in the mortuary vault that he had constructed under the cathedral. When Hennessey will was read, he had an estate of property and bank accounts exceeding $1,000,000. Since he was poor when assuming office, it was widely assumed that Hennessy had been taking money from the archdiocese.

After the death of Hennessey, Pope Pius X on July 24, 1900, appointed John J. Keane, titular archbishop of Damascus, as the second archbishop of Dubuque.

On January 15, 1902, Pius X erected the Diocese of Sioux City from the western half of the archdiocese. During his tenure as archbishop, John Keane encouraged postgraduate courses and ongoing education for priests, and doubled the faculty and buildings of St. Joseph&#x27;s College. He established 12 academies for girls and two for boys in the archdiocese. Due to poor health, Keene resigned as archbishop of Dubuque in 1911.

To succeed John Keene, on August 11, 1911, Pius X appointed Bishop James Keane from the Diocese of Cheyenne as the next archbishop of Dubuque. One of James Keane&#x27;s interests as archbishop was Columbia College, later called Loras College. When he came to Dubuque, Columbia had an enrollment of 330 students and a faculty of 20. By the time he died, Columbia had 700 students and 48 faculty members.

A strong believer in Catholic education, James Keane encouraged all Catholics in the archdiocese tp support the parochial schools, even if they did not have children attending them. He also started the diocesan newspaper, the &quot;Witness&quot;. In 1928, the Sisters of Mercy opened Mount Mercy Junior College in Cedar Rapids. It was a two-year college for women that in 1960 became Mount Mercy University. Keene died on August 2, 1929.

On January 17, 1930, Pope Pius XI named Bishop Francis J. Beckman from the Diocese of Lincoln as archbishop of Dubuque. Impressed with the Catholic culture he had seen in Europe, Beckman began to collect fine art pieces. The Beckman collection includes works of Winslow Homer, Rembrandt, Rubens, and Van Dyck.

In 1936, promoter Phillip Suetter convinced Beckman to invest in a gold mine in Oregon. Beckman borrowed money on promissory notes to fund the project. It soon became clear that the project was a scam. In 1941, the Vatican ordered the creation of a Special Commission on Administration, composed of three American archbishops, to take control of the archdiocese&#x27;s finances. In 1942, Suetter was convicted of violating the Securities and Exchange Act. With the diocese $600,000 in debt, the archbishops recommended to Pius XII that he appoint a coadjutor archbishop to run the archdiocese.

=== 1944 to 1984 ===
On June 15, 1944, Pope Pius XII appointed Bishop Henry Rohlman from Davenport as coadjutor archbishop of Dubuque. When Beckman retired in 1947, Rohlman automatically succeeded him as bishop of Dubuque.

While Rohlman was archbishop, Christ the King Chapel was constructed at Loras College, St. Mary&#x27;s Home for Children was built in Dubuque, and the number of priests in the archdiocese rose from 290 to 345. Rohlman, along with the other bishops in Iowa, re-established the Mount St. Bernard Seminary for the education of new priests in the province. The archdiocese built a $2.5 million home for the seminary in Dubuque.

On October 15, 1949, Pius XII named Bishop Leo Binz from the Diocese of Winona as coadjutor archbishop in Dubuque. When Rohlman retired on December 2, 1954, Binz replaced him. During his seven years as archbishop, Binz helped develop Catholic high schools in the archdiocese. He also established the North American Martyrs Retreat House in Cedar Falls, and expanded the archdiocesan branch of Catholic Charities. On December 16, 1961, Pope John XXIII named Binz as archbishop of Saint Paul.

John XXIII nominated Bishop James Byrne from the Diocese of Boise to be the next archbishop of Dubuque on March 7, 1962. After the Second Vatican Council (1962 to 1965), Byrne implemented many of its reforms in the archdiocese, including a priests senate, a clergy advisory board, and an advisory board for the assignment of priests to parishes. In 1964, the Trappist sisters founded Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbey in Dubuque.

===1983 to present===

Byrne retired from office on August 23, 1983. On December 20, 1983, Pope John Paul II appointed Bishop Daniel Kucera of the Diocese of Salina as the eighth archbishop of Dubuque.

In 1987, Kucera launched a plan that divided the archdiocese into three regions with a resident bishop in each. The Dubuque Region was served by retired Archbishop James Byrne and Archbishop Kucera; the Cedar Rapids Region by Bishop Francis Dunn, and Waterloo Region by William Franklin who was consecrated as a bishop in April 1987. However, Bishop Kucera eventually dropped the plan after the death of Bishop Dunn in 1989 and Bishop Franklin&#x27;s nomination as the head of the Diocese of Davenport.

In 1986 the archdiocese celebrated the 150th anniversary of its founding. John Paul II named Bishop Jerome Hanus from the Diocese of St. Cloud as coadjutor archbishop in Dubuque on August 23, 1994. When retired on October 16, 1995, Hanus became archbishop.

As archbishop, Hanus implemented a strategic planning process throughout the archdiocese. He sent videotaped messages to all the parishes to be played at mass. Parishioners were given opportunities to respond and express their own views. Hanus then issued a vision statement, which spelled out his plans for the archdiocese. These plans included an increased role for the laity in leadership roles, necessitated by the priest shortage and the changing demographics of the archdiocese. These conditions also forced Hanus to combine and close a number of parishes.

After Hanus retired in 2013, Pope Francis on April 8, 2013, appointed Bishop Michael Jackels from the Diocese of Wichita as the next archbishop of Dubuque. On April 24, 2023, a cardiac condition forced Jackels to immediately retire as archbishop. Francis appointed Bishop Emeritus Richard Pates from Des Moines to serve as the apostolic administrator, running the archdiocese.

On July 26, 2023, Francis appointed Thomas Zinkula from Davenport as the eleventh archbishop of Dubuque. As of October 2024, he is the current archbishop of Dubuque

== Early parishes ==

=== St. John the Baptist ===
Founded in 1874, St. John the Baptist parish is now part of the St. Elizabeth Pastorate, a cluster of parishes in northern Dubuque County, Iowa. In July 1874, Bishop Hennessy granted Catholic residents of Centralia permission to build St. John the Baptist Church. They laid the cornerstone in the fall of 1874 and Reverend George W. Heer became the first pastor in 1875. When the railroad came through neighboring Peosta, Archbishop John Keane decided in 1923 to move St. John there. During the winter, parishioners would travel to services by horse-drawn bobsled. In 1989, the parish dedicated a new church building.

=== St. Francis ===
Founded in 1891, St. Francis Parish in Balltown is now part of the St. John Baptist de La Salle Pastorate. The parish traces its history to 1858 when area Catholics petitioned Bishop Loras to establish a parish for them. Loras visited Balltown and offered mass in a log cabin. In 1891, parishioners built a brick building to house a school and a convent. and established a cemetery. The school opened in September 1891 with 45 children. The priest celebrated mass in a small sanctuary adjoining the schoolroom.

In 1892, the parish laid the cornerstone for the St. Francis Church building. On August 27, 1976, the church was destroyed by fire. The parish built a new church, demolishing the old convent building to make room for it.

=== Ss. Peter and Paul ===

Founded in 1852, Ss. Peter and Paul Parish in Sherrill, Iowa, is now part of the St. John Baptist de La Salle Pastorate.

Before the parish was founded, its Catholics had to travel 15 miles by ox-team to Dubuque to attend mass. With the influx of German Catholic immigrants to the area, Bishop Loras established the St. William Parish in Sherrill. It was renamed Ss. Peter and Paul Parish in 1860. In 1889, the parish replaced its original wood church with the current brick and stone Romanesque Revival structure. During the 1970s, the parish removed the original carved wood altars from the church and painted over its 19th-century wood trim. 

For over 100 years, the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration (FSPA) of La Crosse, Wisconsin, operated the parish school. The school is now consolidated in Sherrill with the parish school from Balltown.

<text>Santa Rosa de Copán () is a municipality in Honduras. The city of Santa Rosa de Copán is the municipal seat and the departmental capital of the Honduran department of Copán. It is located approximately above mean sea level.

Santa Rosa de Copán is the largest and most important city in western Honduras with a population of 61,800 (2023 calculation). Santa Rosa is the governmental hub of the department of Copán. The city is connected through the International Highway of the West (CA-4) with San Pedro Sula to the North and with the borders of El Salvador at El Poy and Guatemala at Agua Caliente to the west. Santa Rosa has a subtropical climate with temperatures ranging from to in the summer (March–June), and from to in the winter (December–February).

The historical centre of Santa Rosa de Copán has been declared a Honduran national monument, with preservation of its Republican or Neoclassical architecture and cobblestone streets that has its origins in a prosperous tobacco farming industry of the 18th century. Santa Rosa is situated at a strategic point between Copán Ruinas and Gracias, Lempira and the Celaque National Park. As before, tobacco farming remains a staple of the local economy, particularly the cultivation of premium cigar tobaccos. The La Flor de Copán cigar factory is located in the city.

== History ==
The town was founded in the early 18th century. On 8 August 1705, the Spanish colonial captain Don Juan García de la Candelaria acquired the area then called &quot;Los Llanos&quot; from the Spanish crown and founded his estate with four ranches, later the first settlers named it Santa Rosa, and later Santa Rosa de Los Llanos. A tobacco industry developed in the early 18th Century and in 1765 the town was picked as the site for La Real Factoria del Tabacos, the Royal Tobacco Company, a Spanish crown company. Later, the Gracias a Dios Department was split in two departments, becoming Copán department and Lempira department.

The town was on various occasions the capital of the State of Honduras. On 7 May 1862 the nation&#x27;s President Don Victoriano Castellanos Cortes, issued Legislative Decree No. 3, giving the country the title of &quot;Republic of Honduras&quot; instead of &quot;State of Honduras.&quot; In 1865, the town was renamed Santa Rosa de Copán.

Its Catedral de Santa Rosa, dedicated to Saint Rosa, is the cathedral episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Santa Rosa de Copán (established on 1916.02.02).

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification, Santa Rosa has a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;) that closely borders a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;). Temperatures are relatively consistent year throughout the course of the year and the town is not as hot as other locations in the tropics because of its altitude. Like other locations with this climate, there is a pronounced drier season during the “winter” months. The location sees on average roughly 1500mm of precipitation annually.

==Sports==
Football club Deportes Savio has been playing in the Honduran National league since 2007 and play their home matches at the Estadio Sergio Antonio Reyes.

<doc id="592269" wikidata="Q907578" url="?curid=592269" title="One by One (Foo Fighters album)">
<text>One by One is the fourth studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released on October 22, 2002, through Roswell and RCA Records. Production on the album was troubled, with initial recording sessions considered unsatisfying and raising tensions between the band members. They eventually decided to redo the album from scratch during a two-week period at frontman Dave Grohl&#x27;s home studio in Alexandria, Virginia. The album, which includes the successful singles &quot;All My Life&quot; and &quot;Times Like These&quot;, has been noted for its introspective lyrics and a heavier, more aggressive sound compared to the band&#x27;s earlier work, which Grohl said was intended to translate the energy of the Foo Fighters&#x27; live performances into a recording. This was the first album recorded with Chris Shiflett as part of the band, and the first in which Grohl did not play drums, as drum duties were permanently assigned to Taylor Hawkins.

The album was a commercial success, topping the charts in Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, and sold over one million copies in the United States. &quot;One by One&quot; was positively received by critics, who praised its sound and production, and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2004, the second for the band.

==Production==
Frontman Dave Grohl began working on new material for the band&#x27;s next album as early as 2000 during the band&#x27;s tour promoting &quot;There Is Nothing Left to Lose&quot;. Following the tour, the band started to compose songs for their next album in early 2001. After demo work in drummer Taylor Hawkins&#x27; home studio in Topanga, the band used the second quarter of 2001 to perform in European festivals. In August, after performing in Chelmsford&#x27;s V Festival, Hawkins suffered a heroin overdose that left him in a coma for two weeks. After taking time off to recover, during which Grohl accepted an offer to play drums for the Queens of the Stone Age on their album &quot;Songs for the Deaf&quot;, the band got together in October 2001 to continue composition. During November and December, they had been recording at Grohl&#x27;s Studio 606 in Alexandria, Virginia, working with both the producer for their previous album, Adam Kasper, and recording engineer Nick Raskulinecz, whom they met after he had engineered &quot;A320&quot; for &quot;&quot;. Raskulinecz had just left his job at Sound City Studios, and speculated that Grohl, having found difficulty in &#x27;finding a guy who would commit to sitting in his basement for four months&#x27;, picked him for his energetic and enthusiastic nature.

The progress of the Virginia sessions started to become stale, so with six tracks finished, in January 2002 the band moved to Los Angeles&#x27; Conway Studios for a &quot;change of scenery&quot;. 29 songs were recorded, including &quot;The One&quot;—featured in the film &quot;Orange County&quot; and released as a standalone single— and ten finished tracks that were considered for the upcoming album. The sessions took four months and were at the cost of over US$1,000,000. It was the first Foo Fighters album produced with Pro Tools and on which the band members have recorded separately.

The recording sessions were considered unsatisfying; Hawkins said that &quot;nobody had their studio chops together&quot;, and Grohl considered that the band was lacking enthusiasm and were too focused on production, adding that he felt the rough mixes &quot;sucked a lot of the life out of the songs&quot; and &quot;sound[e]d like another band playing our songs.&quot; Tensions were escalating, as arguments broke out at the studio, and Hawkins said he &quot;didn&#x27;t feel we were much of a band&quot; as there was much animosity among the bandmembers. Bassist Nate Mendel said that he was in a bad attitude during the sessions due to disagreements with Grohl, and guitarist Chris Shiflett added that he felt he would at times spend whole days in the studio without playing anything.

The band also showed disappointment with the ten songs that emerged from the sessions, as Hawkins described the finished tracks as &quot;million-dollar demos&quot;, and Grohl considered the recordings &quot;far too clean, too tame and boring&quot;. The band only liked five of the ten songs, and thought that listeners would enjoy the other five anyway. Grohl was afraid to promote the album because of his lack of confidence in it. After manager John Silva listened to the recordings, he agreed that it was not a work that represented the band well, and that &quot;we can release it now, but I don&#x27;t know if anyone would want to buy it&quot;.

In April 2002, the band discarded the recordings and took a break. The members then each started individual projects: Grohl became the full-time Queens of the Stone Age drummer for a tour, Shiflett started the Viva Death and Jackson projects with his brother Scott and rejoined his former band Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, Hawkins played with Jane&#x27;s Addiction bassist Eric Avery, and Mendel both played with Juno and reunited with his former bandmate William Goldsmith in The Fire Theft. Later on April, they reunited for the Foo Fighters&#x27; scheduled concert at the 2002 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which Grohl felt could be the last the band would perform. During the rehearsals, the tensions broke out in huge fights, especially between Grohl and Hawkins. The musicians decided to at least perform in Coachella before deciding whether to continue playing together or end the band. After enjoying their performance, the bandmembers decided to remain united and returned to re-recording the album.
Grohl decided to take a two-week period before Queens of the Stone Age went on tour to work on the Foo Fighters record, and after consulting Raskulinecz decided to promote him to producer. First, Grohl visited Hawkins in Topanga to rework the songs that had already been done and show new compositions, such as &quot;Times Like These&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, and &quot;Disenchanted Lullaby&quot;. Then Grohl and Hawkins went to Virginia to redo the drum, vocal and guitar tracks across a twelve-day period, and Mendel and Shiflett were later called to record their parts in Los Angeles&#x27; The Hook Studios, which were mostly done with the supervision of Raskulinecz, as Grohl had to go back to Queens of the Stone Age. The only remaining track from the original sessions was &quot;Tired of You&quot;, which features a guest appearance by Queen guitarist Brian May. Two of the demos would leak online in 2012, with the other five unreleased demos being leaked on Reddit in 2015.

The title &quot;One by One&quot;—taken from a lyric on &quot;All My Life&quot;, and for which the spelling &quot;1 X 1&quot; was also considered—was chosen according to Grohl because &quot;it somehow made sense&quot;, and even worked as a reference to relationships—&quot;one person by another person, or one after another&quot;. The singer added that the word &quot;one&quot; is frequently used in the album&#x27;s lyrics, meaning either loneliness or continuation.

==Composition==

Upon its release, &quot;One by One&quot; was considered the band&#x27;s heaviest album, as Grohl described the sound as a darker and more aggressive approach as opposed to the band&#x27;s usual work. Grohl said that the album mainly focused on the energy of live performances, which he attributed to both the extensive touring preceding the compositions, and the short period during which the re-recordings were done. The frontman added that although the previous albums had songs which were never played live, the track listing on &quot;One by One&quot; was compared to a set list where he would play all songs every night. The early recording sessions had manager John Silva complimenting the songs that did not sound like the band&#x27;s previous work, and suggesting that Grohl &quot;stop trying to write hit singles and go back to being weird&quot;, the band decided to be more experimental in addition to writing music meant to be played in full arenas. The variety included moody songs such as &quot;Have It All&quot; and &quot;Tired of You&quot;, the seven-minute &quot;epic opus&quot; album closer &quot;Come Back&quot;, and the alternating dynamics of &quot;Halo&quot;, which drew inspiration from Tom Petty, Cheap Trick and Guided by Voices. Grohl added that the sonority tried to blend dissonance and melody: &quot;We figured we&#x27;re gonna get mean, we&#x27;re gonna get ugly. And then I end up putting this four-part harmony on it, and all of sudden it&#x27;s beautiful. Like &#x27;wait a second, it was supposed to be gross, and now it&#x27;s gorgeous&#x27;.&quot;

While in previous records Grohl tried to not get introspective in his lyrics, for &quot;One by One&quot; he found himself writing lyrics that matched the &quot;emotional level we were hinting with the music&quot;, such as &quot;Come Back&quot;, with words &quot;revealing all these dark, shitty sides of myself&quot;. The lyrics to a song were usually done after finishing the vocal track for another. Grohl described the track listing as &quot;11 tortured love songs&quot;, with a major theme of &quot;surrendering to yourself&quot;, and a sequencing that described the difficult beginnings of falling in love, and then the relief of feeling comfortable in love. A major inspiration was Grohl&#x27;s new girlfriend Jordyn Blum, as well as the troubled times with the band, demonstrated in &quot;Times Like These&quot;, which laments the absence of the Foo Fighters and ponders about their future. Grohl also described &quot;All My Life&quot;, released as a single, as representative of the album&#x27;s sound for being &quot;much more aggressive&quot; as well as &quot;a little darker, more romantic, creepier than anything we have done&quot;.

==Packaging and formats==
The album artwork was done by Raymond Pettibon, who has worked with punk bands such as Black Flag and Minutemen. Grohl was introduced to Pettibon by ex-Minutemen bassist Mike Watt and, after visiting his house, decided to hire him for the artwork because &quot;we had to somehow pay tribute to Pettibon as a hero, because his stuff, those images just stuck with me my whole life.&quot; Grohl came up with the heart theme used in the booklet and related singles. The album was issued with two different covers, black and white. The first 575,000 units comprised a limited edition with a bonus DVD.

A limited international edition features seven bonus tracks: the outtake &quot;Walking a Line&quot;, three live songs, and three covers, The Psychedelic Furs&#x27; &quot;Sister Europe&quot;, the Ramones&#x27; &quot;Danny Says&quot;—with Shiflett on the vocals—and Joe Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Life of Illusion&quot;—sung by Hawkins. A Norwegian version had an extra album with tracks recorded at the Oslo Spektrum on December 4, 2002. &quot;One by One&quot; was also issued as a double vinyl LP record, and a DVD-Audio with 5.1 surround sound mixes.

An Enhanced CD edition was released with weblinks to their official website and where to download free music.

==Critical reception==
&quot;One by One&quot; received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, a website that assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 75, based on 19 reviews. Reviewer Jon Pareles of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the &quot;potent guitar riffs&quot; and the introspective themes, which he called &quot;stronger and broader than autobiography&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s April Long felt that &quot;even the quieter moments bristle&quot; and considered the album an affirmation of the band&#x27;s quality. Michael Paoletta of &quot;Billboard&quot; considered the album &quot;among the band&#x27;s best work&quot; and that the themes gave the record &quot;an emotional intimacy that makes it all more satisfying&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ken Tucker rated the album A−, calling it full of &quot;unexpected exhilaration&quot; and liking the &quot;exploration of various relationships&quot; on the lyrics. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; reviewer praised the heavy sound of the album, saying it drifted from the light-hearted tone of songs such as &quot;Big Me&quot; while &quot;retaining their melodic instincts&quot;.

However, many reviewers felt that the album was not up to the standards of the Foo Fighters&#x27; previous work. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that although &quot;One by One&quot; was well-produced and played, it was too polished to &quot;hit at a gut-level&quot; and that the songs were &quot;not as immediate or memorable&quot; as the band&#x27;s earlier compositions. Writing for PopMatters, Margaret Schwartz considered the album &quot;ultimately unsatisfying&quot; despite its quality writing and production, particularly for not drifting much from the band&#x27;s typical style. Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described &quot;One by One&quot; as &quot;mostly middling, sticking to slick, pounding, functional rock that doesn&#x27;t dig much deeper than the usual spleen-venting and loud-quiet brooding-to-bluster formula&quot;. BBC&#x27;s Nick Reynolds found the record inconsistent, praising the first four tracks but saying the following songs did not maintain the same quality, and concluding that although &quot;One By One&quot; is a good record, it may frustrate a listener. Eric Carr of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; was very critical of the album, saying it was overproduced and the songs are &quot;weightless, antiseptic cuts&quot; with &quot;skillful composition&quot; but &quot;lacking strength and character&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;One by One&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, while one year earlier at the 45th Grammy Awards &quot;All My Life&quot; was chosen as Best Hard Rock Performance. While the band had a positive opinion about the record following release, as Grohl said the songs were &quot;the best we&#x27;ve ever written&quot;, he and the rest of the Foo Fighters eventually grew distasteful about the results. Grohl stated that he was frustrated at himself for rushing on the album: &quot;four of the songs were good, and the other seven I&#x27;ve never played again in my life.&quot; Hawkins said that &quot;if you think about things too much, they kinda get sterile, as we found out there&quot;, and Shiflett declared that &quot;there are great songs [in &quot;One by One&quot;], and then there are... &quot;parts&quot; of great songs&quot;.
