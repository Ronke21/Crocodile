<text>Christopher Hikaru Nakamura (born December 9, 1987) is an American chess grandmaster, streamer, YouTuber, five-time U.S. Chess Champion, and the reigning World Fischer Random Chess Champion. A chess prodigy, he earned his grandmaster title at the age of 15, the youngest American at the time to do so. With a peak rating of 2816, Nakamura is the tenth-highest-rated player in history. 

Nakamura has represented the United States at seven Chess Olympiads (2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018), securing a team gold medal and two team bronze medals, and participated in three Candidates Tournaments, finishing second in 2024 edition, fourth in 2022 edition, and seventh in the 2016 edition. In May 2014, when FIDE began publishing official rapid and blitz chess ratings, Nakamura ranked No. 1 in the world on both lists; he has remained at or near the No. 1 rank in rapid and blitz ever since.

Since 2018, Nakamura has pursued a career as a content creator and subsequently signed with an esports organization TSM, later joining Misfits Gaming and then Team Falcons. Having popular channels on Twitch, Kick and YouTube, Nakamura is the most popular chess streamer and has been credited with contributing to the growth in popularity of online chess.

== Early life ==
Nakamura was born in Hirakata, Osaka Prefecture, Japan, to an American mother, Carolyn Merrow Nakamura, a classically trained musician and former public school teacher, and a Japanese father, Shuichi Nakamura. Nakamura has an older brother, Asuka. When he was two years old, his family moved to the United States, and, a year later in 1990, his parents divorced. He was raised in White Plains, New York. He began playing chess at the age of seven and was coached by his Sri Lankan stepfather, FIDE Master and chess author Sunil Weeramantry. Weeramantry began coaching the Nakamura brothers after Asuka Nakamura won the National Kindergarten Championship in 1992, which led to his developing a relationship with their mother.

== Chess prodigy ==
At age 10, he became the youngest American to beat an International Master when he defeated Jay Bonin at the Marshall Chess Club. Also at age 10, Nakamura became the youngest player to achieve the title of chess master from the United States Chess Federation, breaking the record previously set by Vinay Bhat. (Nakamura&#x27;s record stood until 2008 when Nicholas Nip achieved the master title at the age of 9 years and 11 months.) In 1999, Nakamura won the Laura Aspis Prize, given annually to the top USCF-rated player under age 13. In 2003, at age 15 years and 79 days, Nakamura solidified his reputation as a chess prodigy, becoming the youngest American to earn the grandmaster title at the time, breaking the record of Bobby Fischer by three months.

==Chess career==
In July 2002, Nakamura achieved 56th place at the 30th annual World Open tournament in Philadelphia.

In April 2004, Nakamura achieved a fourth-place finish in the &quot;B&quot; group at the Corus tournament at Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands.

Nakamura qualified for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004, played in Tripoli, Libya, and reached the fourth round, defeating grandmasters Sergey Volkov, Aleksej Aleksandrov, and Alexander Lastin before falling to England&#x27;s Michael Adams, the tournament&#x27;s third-seeded participant and eventual runner-up.

On June 20, 2005, Nakamura was selected as the 19th Frank Samford Chess Fellow, receiving a grant of $32,000 to further his chess education and competition.

Nakamura won the 2005 U.S. Chess Championship (held in November and December 2004), scoring seven points over nine rounds to tie grandmaster Alexander Stripunsky for first place. Nakamura defeated Stripunsky in two straight rapid playoff games to claim the title and become the youngest national champion since Fischer. Nakamura finished the tournament without a loss and, in the seventh round, defeated grandmaster Gregory Kaidanov, then the nation&#x27;s top-ranked player.

Following that victory, Nakamura played a challenge match dubbed the &quot;Duelo de Jóvenes Prodigios&quot; in Mexico against Russian grandmaster Sergey Karjakin and defeated his fellow prodigy by 4½–1½.

In November and December 2005, Nakamura competed in the FIDE World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, seeded 28th (of 128 players) but failed to advance beyond the first round. He lost each of his two games to Indian grandmaster Surya Ganguly.

In 2006, Nakamura was offered a full scholarship to the University of Texas, Dallas but instead began attending Dickinson College, with a partial scholarship, in order to take a break from chess. Later in the year, he announced that he would resume playing. The same year, he helped the U.S. team win the bronze medal in the Chess Olympiad at Turin, Italy, playing on the third board behind Gata Kamsky and 2006 U.S. Champion Alexander Onischuk. In the same year, he won the 16th North American Open in Las Vegas.

In January 2007, Nakamura shared second place at the GibTelecom Masters in Gibraltar. He placed joint first in the tournament the following year, finishing with five straight wins to tie with Chinese GM Bu Xiangzhi, whom he then proceeded to beat in the rapidplay playoff.

In October 2007, Nakamura won the &quot;Magistral D&#x27;Escacs&quot; tournament in Barcelona and the Corsican circuit rapid chess tournament.

Nakamura won the 2008 Finet Chess960 Open in Mainz, Germany. In November 2008, he won the Cap d&#x27;Agde Rapid Tournament in Cap d&#x27;Agde, defeating Anatoly Karpov in the semifinals and Vassily Ivanchuk in the finals. In February 2009, he came joint third at the 7th Gibtelecom Masters in Gibraltar, again finishing strongly with 4½/5 to end the event on 7½/10.

=== 2009: Second U.S. Championship and other tournament successes ===
Nakamura won the 2009 U.S. Chess Championship (St Louis, Missouri, May 2009), scoring 7/9 to take clear first ahead of 17-year-old GM-elect Robert Hess, who shared second with 6½.

In July 2009, Nakamura won the Donostia-San Sebastian Chess Festival, tying with former FIDE world champion Ruslan Ponomariov with 6½/9 before defeating Ponomariov in a blitz playoff to win the title over a field including former undisputed world champion Anatoly Karpov, former FIDE world champions Rustam Kasimdzhanov and Ponomariov, 2009 World Junior champion Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, and Peter Svidler among others. In August 2009, Nakamura became the 960 World Chess Champion, beating GM Levon Aronian 3½–½ in Mainz, Germany.

In November 2009, Nakamura participated in the BNbank blitz tournament in Oslo, Norway. He reached the final by winning all 12 of his games. In the championship, he faced the world No. 2 and reigning World Blitz Champion Magnus Carlsen. Nakamura won the match 3–1, further cementing his reputation as one of the best blitz players in the world, despite having not been invited to the 2009 World Blitz championship.

Nakamura skipped the Chess World Cup 2009 in favor of the London Chess Classic in December 2009. Although he drew with the black pieces against eventual winner Magnus Carlsen and with White against former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, Nakamura failed to win a game during the tournament and ended in seventh place out of eight.

=== 2010: Gold medalist and top-ten player ===
Nakamura began 2010 playing first board for the United States at the World Team Chess Championship held in Bursa, Turkey. His performance, including a win over world No. 6 and recent FIDE World Cup winner Boris Gelfand on the black side of a King&#x27;s Indian Defense, won him the individual gold medal for board one and led the U.S. to a second-place finish behind Russia.

Nakamura participated in the Corus Chess Tournament 2010 in Wijk aan Zee. He finished with a score of 7½/13, tying for fourth place with Viswanathan Anand, and behind Carlsen, Alexei Shirov, and Kramnik.

In May, Nakamura participated in the 2010 United States Chess Championship in Saint Louis, Missouri, attempting to defend his 2009 title. Seeded first, he scored 5/7 points to qualify for the round-robin stage against the 1991 champion Gata Kamsky, 2006 champion Alexander Onischuk, and 2008 champion Yuri Shulman. In the round-robin stage, he drew with Kamsky before losing to Shulman, with the white pieces in both games. The loss to Shulman eliminated him from defending his 2009 title.

Nakamura competed in the 39th Chess Olympiad. Although he defeated Lê Quang Liêm and drew Kramnik with the black pieces during the tournament, the U.S. team failed to medal.

From November 5–14, Nakamura competed in the 2010 Mikhail Tal Memorial in Moscow; the field consisted of world No. 3 Levon Aronian, world No. 4 Vladimir Kramnik, world No. 6 Alexander Grischuk, world No. 8 Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, world No. 9 Sergey Karjakin, Pavel Eljanov, Boris Gelfand, Alexei Shirov, and Wang Hao. The average Elo of the field was 2757, making it the third-strongest tournament in chess history at the time. Nakamura finished at +1, defeating Eljanov and drawing every other player to finish in a tie for fourth place and missing out on a tie for first place by blundering into a draw in a winning position in the final round against Grischuk. Nakamura&#x27;s round two win over Eljanov placed him in the world top-ten in the live ratings for the first time in his career. Nakamura&#x27;s performance at this tournament, his first involving an entirely super-elite field allowed him to &quot;force (the chess elite) to respect him&quot;, according to noted Russian commentator grandmaster Sergey Shipov.

From November 16–18, Nakamura made his debut at the 2010 World Blitz Championship in Moscow. Despite a disastrous start and losing four of his first five games to Magnus Carlsen, Vladimir Kramnik, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, and Sergey Karjakin, he recovered to score 5/7 in the second half of the day and finished with a score of 7½/14, 2½ points behind co-leaders Carlsen and Levon Aronian, whom he defeated in their individual games. On the second day, Nakamura avenged his earlier losses against both Carlsen and Kramnik and scored 8/14, for a total of 15½/28, three points behind Aronian and a point and a half behind Carlsen. Nakamura finished with 21½/38 for fifth place behind Gelfand, Carlsen, Teimour Radjabov and champion Aronian.

In December 2010, Nakamura finished fourth in the London Chess Classic, among a field including Anand, Carlsen, Kramnik, Michael Adams, Nigel Short, David Howell, and Luke McShane. This included a win with Black against Kramnik, evening their career head-to-head record at 2½/2½. The tournament was won by Magnus Carlsen. Nakamura&#x27;s performance ensured that he would officially join the world top ten in January 2011.

===2011: Tata Steel Group A victory===
In the January 2011 FIDE rating list, Nakamura was ranked number 10 in the world with a rating of 2751.

Nakamura began training with former world champion Garry Kasparov. The first of several training sessions were held in New York at the beginning of January, but the training ended in December 2011.

From January 14 through 30, Nakamura competed in the Tata Steel Grandmaster A tournament in Wijk aan Zee among a field of world No. 1 and defending champion Magnus Carlsen, world champion, world No. 2 and former world champion Viswanathan Anand, world No. 3 and reigning World Blitz champion Levon Aronian, world No. 4 and former world champion Vladimir Kramnik, world No. 7 Alexander Grischuk, former FIDE world champion Ruslan Ponomariov, reigning Russian champion Ian Nepomniachtchi, reigning Chinese champion Wang Hao, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, Alexei Shirov, Anish Giri, Jan Smeets, and Erwin L&#x27;Ami. The average rating of the field was 2740, making this thirteen-round event a category 20 tournament. After twelve rounds, Nakamura was in clear first place with 8½ points going into the final round, half a point ahead of Anand and a full point ahead of Carlsen and Aronian. In the final round, Nakamura drew against Wang with the black pieces in a King&#x27;s Indian Defense. With the draw, Nakamura finished with 9/13 (+5), a tournament performance rating of 2879, and guaranteed at least a share of first place. With Anand&#x27;s final round draw against Nepomniachtchi, Nakamura clinched sole possession of first place, making him the first American to win the Wijk aan Zee tournament since 1980. The win also guaranteed that Nakamura would join Carlsen (winner of the 2010 Pearl Spring chess tournament) as qualifiers for Grand Slam Masters Final 2011 in September 2011. Nakamura after the tournament stated that his goal was to reach a 2800 rating by the end of the year; the win raised his rating from 2751 to 2774 and from world No. 10 to world No. 7 on the unofficial live rating list.

Kasparov called Nakamura&#x27;s victory the best by an American in more than 100 years:

In an e-mail, Kasparov said, &quot;Fischer never won a tournament ahead of the world champion. He was second in Santa Monica&quot;, referring to the Second Piatigorsky Cup. &quot;Of course, there were far fewer such events back then, and Fischer had several great tournament results like Stockholm 62&quot;, the interzonal qualifier for the world championship. &quot;Reuben Fine only equaled Keres on points at AVRO in 38.&quot; Referring to the breakout performance of Frank J. Marshall, the United States Champion from 1909 to 1936, Mr. Kasparov continued, &quot;Then you have Marshall at Cambridge Springs in 1904 ahead of Lasker, though Tarrasch wasn&#x27;t there. So unless you include Capablanca as an American player, I think you can go back to Pillsbury at Hastings 1895 for an American tournament victory on par with Nakamura&#x27;s.

Following his super tournament triumph, Nakamura was given the key to the city of Memphis, Tennessee on February 15, 2011. The victory also opened the door for Nakamura to receive invitations from other super grandmaster tournaments for the first time, and increased his world ranking to a career-high number eight. In May, he contested a six-game match in the United States against world No. 11 Ponomariov, where he lost the first game but rallied to win the match 3½–2½, raising his rating to 2777 and ranking to world No. 6 on the unofficial live rating list, both career-highs to that date. From June 11–21, he made his debut at the Bazna Kings Tournament in Romania in a field including Carlsen, world No. 5 Vassily Ivanchuk, world No. 6 Sergey Karjakin, world No. 13 Teimour Radjabov and Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu; the tournament was a Category XXI event with an average ELO of 2760, making it the third strongest tournament in history; Nakamura finished 4½/10; the tournament was won by Carlsen on tiebreak over Karjakin. Despite the disappointing performance at Bazna, he reached a new career-high world ranking of No. 6 in the July 2011 FIDE list with a 2770 rating.

From July 21–31, Nakamura made his debut at the Dortmund Invitational in Germany; the field comprised world No. 5 Kramnik, world No. 10 Ponomariov, world No. 27 Lê Quang Liêm, world No. 40 Giri, and Georg Meier. Nakamura had a second consecutive disappointing performance, beginning at −3 before winning his last two games, including a last-round win over tournament winner Kramnik on the black side of the King&#x27;s Indian Defense, to finish at 4½/10.

Nakamura competed in the Grand Slam Masters Final 2011 in September, after which he played in the Tal Memorial for the second consecutive year in a field comprising Carlsen, Anand, Aronian, Karjakin, Kramnik, Ivanchuk, Gelfand, Hao, and Nepomniachtchi. He finished the year by participating in the London Chess Classic for the third consecutive time.

===2012: Third U.S. Championship===
Starting in 2012, he participated in the Reggio Emilia Tournament, tying for second with Alexander Morozevich of Russia and Fabiano Caruana of Italy. Anish Giri got first place in the tournament, a half-point ahead of the field. Nakamura then played in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament, finishing fifth. He won the US Championship in May with a score of 8½, one point ahead of Gata Kamsky.

In June 2012, Nakamura played at the Tal Memorial in Moscow. In a tightly bunched field, he finished tied for eighth with Luke McShane, 1½ points behind winner Magnus Carlsen. He participated in the Biel Chess Festival, finishing third with Anish Giri, behind Carlsen and Wang Hao. At the 2012 Chess Olympiad in August and September, he led the U.S. team to a fifth-place finish with a +4−1=4 record on the first board. Nakamura then suffered through the FIDE London Grand Prix tournament, at one point losing four games in a row. He finished tied for last with Giri. After another lackluster performance in the European Club Championship in Eilat, Israel, Nakamura finished first in the &quot;crown group&quot; at the Univé tournament in Hoogeveen, the Netherlands. In December he tied for third with Mickey Adams in the London Chess Classic with a +3−1=4 score. Nakamura finished the year by winning three silver medals in the three chess events (rapid, blitz and blindfold) at the World Mind Games in Beijing.
After this tournament, Nakamura achieved a 2844 FIDE blitz rating and a 2795 FIDE rapid rating.

After what was to him a disappointing tournament at the fifth edition of the King&#x27;s Tournament in Medias (although Nakamura placed third of six among a cadre of top Grandmasters), Nakamura tweeted that he was focusing on the 2011 World Series of Poker, in which he played, although busted out on the second day. Kasparov, who had been training Nakamura at the time, publicly grumbled about his interest in poker.

===2013: Top FIDE blitz rating===

Nakamura began 2013 with a 7/13 (+3−2=8) result at the Tata Steel tournament in Wijk aan Zee, finishing sixth. He scored a win against then world number five Fabiano Caruana with the black pieces in an Old Indian Defense. He then played at the FIDE Grand Prix tournament in Zug, Switzerland in April, scoring 6½/11 (+3−1=7) and finishing clear second behind Veselin Topalov.

Nakamura had an up-and-down Tal Memorial in June, at one point winning three straight games and then later losing three straight. He finished in sixth place with a 4½/9 score (+4−4=1). However, he won the blitz tournament before the classical competition, raising his FIDE blitz rating to 2879, first in the world at the time.

=== 2020: Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour ===
Nakamura started 2020 as the top-ranked blitz chess player in the world. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, chess moved online, with Nakamura playing an important role in popularizing it.

Since April 2020, Nakamura participated in the Magnus Carlsen Chess Tour with a prize pool of $1 million. He won the group stage of Magnus Carlsen Invitational and finished second behind Magnus Carlsen.

After many victories in shorter tournaments on Chess.com, including Titled Tuesday and Super Swiss, Nakamura failed in his defense of his U.S. Chess Champion title, finishing seventh. The tournament, which took place online in a rapid format, was won by Wesley So.

In October, Nakamura held a 77-board charity simultaneous exhibition online, raising around $9,500 for Doctors Without Borders. Before the 2020 United States presidential election, he challenged President Barack Obama to a game of chess to raise funds for the presidential nominee Joe Biden’s victory fund and ActBlue.

Nakamura won the Chess.com Speed Chess Championship in December. It was his third victory in the format. The site promoted the knockout tournament by emphasizing a possible rematch of Nakamura and world champion Magnus Carlsen in the final. However, French grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave defeated Carlsen in their semi-final match, earning a spot in the final against Nakamura. In the Speed Chess Championship final, Nakamura defeated Vachier-Lagrave by a score of 18½ to 12½. Nakamura&#x27;s skill at bullet chess proved to be the deciding factor, as he beat Vachier-Lagrave 8–3 in the bullet section of the match. Previous to the final, Nakamura had defeated grandmasters Haik Martirosyan 21–5, Vladimir Fedoseev 21½–5½, and Wesley So 13½–12½.

=== 2021: Champions Chess Tour and return to over-the-board chess ===
Nakamura continued to play the Champions Chess Tour with the Opera Euro Rapid tournament in February 2021. In the initial round-robin phase of the tournament, Nakamura compiled an up-and-down record. His final round-robin game against fellow American grandmaster Sam Shankland was pivotal. A win or draw in the game would have secured Nakamura&#x27;s qualification to the tournament&#x27;s knockout phase. He obtained a winning position against Shankland but failed to convert the advantage and eventually lost the game. This resulted in his exclusion from the knockout phase based on tiebreaks with Russian grandmaster Daniil Dubov.

In the Magnus Carlsen Invitational, the next tournament on the Champions Chess Tour, Nakamura scored +3−0=12 to place fourth in the preliminary stage and thus qualified for the knockout phase. He then lost his two-day quarterfinal match against Russian GM Ian Nepomniachtchi. He drew 2–2 with Nepomniachtchi on the first day but lost 2½–½ on the second day.

Nakamura scored +4−0=11 in the preliminary stage of the New In Chess Classic, the fifth event of the Champions Chess Tour, thus finishing second and qualifying for the tournament&#x27;s knockout stage.

Nakamura qualified for the knockouts of the other two events, FTX Crypto Cup and Chessable Masters, finishing in the overall fifth place in the Tour after showing the second strongest performance in the Tour Final.

In August 2021, Nakamura won the Saint Louis Rapid and Blitz competition without a single loss in his first over-the-board tournament since before the COVID-19 pandemic. He had three wins and six draws in the rapid portion, as well as six wins and twelve draws in the blitz portion.

In December 2021, he won Chess.com&#x27;s 2021 Speed Chess Championship by defeating GM Wesley So 23–8 in the final match. This was his fourth successive victory in this event.

From 26 to 28 December 2021, Nakamura participated in the 2021 World Rapid Chess Championship in Warsaw, where he ended up in sixth place after tiebreaks. On the 29th he played the first leg of the 2021 World Blitz Chess Championship, but had to forfeit the tournament due to testing positive for COVID-19.

=== 2022: FIDE Grand Prix, second Candidates, and World Fischer Random Championship ===

Nakamura was granted a wildcard entry to the FIDE Grand Prix 2022 in December 2021 by the FIDE President. In the first leg of the tournament held in Berlin in February 2022, he played in Pool A alongside Andrey Esipenko, Étienne Bacrot, and Alexander Grischuk, making it his first classical tournament in two years. Through five rounds, he held a 3½/5 (+2−0=3) lead in his group. Following a thriller against Esipenko in the sixth round, Nakamura held a draw with Black to win his group and advance to the semifinals to face Richárd Rapport. With White, he convincingly won a complicated rook-and-pawn endgame to take a 1–0 lead in the semifinals. He held a draw in the following game to advance to the finals against Levon Aronian. The classical portion was drawn, but he won in rapid 2–0 to win the first leg of the tournament.

On March 18, Nakamura won the 2022 edition of the Bullet Chess Championship hosted by chess.com, beating Andrew Tang in the final.

Entering the third and final leg of the FIDE Grand Prix 2022, Nakamura was ranked second in the Grand Prix standings with 13 points. He played in Pool A alongside Andrey Esipenko, Grigoriy Oparin, and Levon Aronian, who was ranked third in the standings entering the tournament with 10 points. On March 28, Nakamura defeated Esipenko to finish a 4/6 run in the round-robin stage, guaranteeing him at least second place and qualifying him for the Candidates Tournament 2022. On March 31, after a draw in the semi-finals against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, he secured first place in the Grand Prix standings, thus winning the Grand Prix 2022 series. He would eventually proceed to defeat Mamedyarov by drawing in classical and proceeding to rapid tiebreakers, where he won the tiebreakers in a 2–0 sweep. This briefly propelled Nakamura to the highest live rapid chess rating on April 1, surpassing Magnus Carlsen, though Carlsen regained his number one spot after Nakamura lost to Wesley So on tiebreakers in the finals of the third leg of the Grand Prix. From June 16 to July 4, Nakamura participated in the 2022 Candidates Tournament, finishing in fourth place with a score of 7½/14. Had Nakamura drawn or won against Ding Liren in the final round of the tournament, he would have finished second and faced Ian Nepomniachtchi to determine a new World Chess Champion following Carlsen&#x27;s decision (which was affirmed following the candidates) not to defend his title.

On October 20, Hans Niemann filed a $100 million lawsuit against Nakamura and others (see Carlsen–Niemann controversy.) Later in October, Nakamura won the second World Fischer Random Chess Championship ahead of reigning World Fischer Random Champion Wesley So, World Classical Champion Magnus Carlsen, World Rapid Champion Nodirbek Abdusattorov, and 2021 World Chess Championship challenger Ian Nepomniachtchi, defeating the latter in the armageddon match. In December, Nakamura won his fifth straight Speed Chess Championship, defeating Magnus Carlsen 14½ vs. 13½ in the final. On December 30, Nakamura finished as the runner-up in the World Blitz Chess Championship 2022 with a score of 15/21 behind Magnus Carlsen.

=== 2023: American Cup, Norway Chess and Bullet Chess ===

In February 2023, Nakamura finished as runner-up in the Airthings Masters, coming in second to Magnus Carlsen. In March, he secured his first over-the-board victory of the year at the American Cup, defeating GM Wesley So in the final. 

Nakamura won the Chessable Masters in April during the Champions Chess Tour. He overcame Magnus Carlsen in the loser&#x27;s bracket final and emerged victorious in two matches against Fabiano Caruana to win the grand final.

Nakamura won Norway Chess 2023 in June by beating Fabiano Caruana in the final round to finish the tournament ½ points in front of him, ending with a score of 16½/27. The tournament used an unusual scoring system that awarded 3 points for a win in the classical games and zero points for a loss in classical. If players drew their classical game, they played an Armageddon game. The Armageddon winner scored ½ point and the loser scored 1 point. Nakamura&#x27;s performance at the tournament also resulted in him being ranked No. 2 in FIDE&#x27;s July rankings for the first time since 2015.

In July, Nakamura won his fourth Bullet Chess Championship title, defeating runner-up Magnus Carlsen in a tight Grand Final match.

Nakamura participated in the Chess World Cup 2023 in August, where he was second seeded. He received a bye win on the first round, won the second round on tiebreaks against Indian grandmaster Karthik Venkataraman with +0−0=2 in Classical and +1−0=1 in rapid, won the third round against Hungarian grandmaster Benjámin Gledura with 1½–½ score in the classical portion but ended up losing to the Indian Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa on tiebreaks with a score of 1–3 (two draws in classical portion and two losses in the rapid portion).

In October and November, Nakamura participated in the FIDE Grand Swiss 2023, finishing in second place with 8/11 points (+5−0=6) and thus qualifying for the Candidates Tournament 2024. Vladimir Kramnik made a statement on his Chess.com profile purportedly insinuating that an unnamed high-level player was cheating on November 20. Nakamura believed this post was targeted towards him, and responded with a statement on Twitter reading &quot;Vladimir appears to be referencing my record...is he really accusing me of cheating??? [&quot;sic&quot;]&quot;. Nakamura also expressed disappointment with Ian Nepomniachtchi for reposting Kramnik&#x27;s claims.

Nakamura played in the Champions Chess Tour Finals in December. He finished fifth in the eight-player field. He compiled a good record in the tournament&#x27;s regular games (+6−3=9) but a poor showing in the Armageddon games (one win and five losses) prevented a higher finish. Throughout 2023 Nakamura frequently played in chess.com&#x27;s Titled Tuesday online blitz tournaments, which usually attracted strong fields, often including five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen. Nakamura led all players with 18 wins in the tournaments during 2023.

===2024: Candidates Tournament and Norway Chess===

In April, Nakamura played in the Candidates Tournament 2024. He was touted as one of the favourites to win (alongside Fabiano Caruana) by former world champions Magnus Carlsen and Viswanathan Anand, but had a slow start to the tournament after losing to Vidit Gujrathi with the white pieces in the second round. During the eighth round, Nakamura defeated Caruana.

After losing to Vidit in the ninth round, Nakamura ran off three consecutive victories in rounds ten, eleven and twelve against Nijat Abasov, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Alireza Firouzja. This put him in a three-way tie for first place with Ian Nepomniachtchi and Gukesh Dommaraju. In the final two rounds of the tournament Nakamura was held to draws. He finished in second place with a record of 8½/14 (tied with Nepomniachtchi and Caruana on overall score but placing ahead of them due to tiebreaks: better Sonneborn–Berger score and more wins than Caruana, equal Sonneborn–Berger score but more wins than Nepomniachtchi.)

In May and June Nakamura competed in the Norway Chess tournament against five other grandmasters. He finished second with 15½ points behind Magnus Carlsen at 17½. The tournament was a double round-robin in classical chess, with an Armageddon playoff after each classical draw. A classical win counted for three points, a classical draw and Armageddon win counted for one-and-a-half points, a classical draw and Armageddon loss counted for one point, and a classical loss counted for zero points. Nakamura compiled a +2 record in classical games (+2−0=8) the same as Carlsen, but a better record in Armageddon playoffs gave Carlsen the victory, though Nakamura did defeat Carlsen in one of their individual Armageddon games.

Nakamura played in the online Chess.com Bullet Chess Championship in June. He defeated grandmasters Christopher Yoo (14½-4½), David Paravyan (13½-5½), Nihal Sarin (19–12) and Daniel Naroditsky (16½–11½) to reach the grand final. In a match marked by personal conflict and technical connection issues, he lost the double elimination final to Alireza Firouzja (17½–12½ and 12½–10½). In July Nakamura played in the online CrunchLabs Masters tournament on the Champions Chess Tour. He qualified with a 7/9 score in the Swiss play-in but lost a match to Jules Moussard (2–1) and was placed in Division Two of the tournament. He won against Bogdan-Daniel Deac (2½–1½), Maxim Matlakov (1½–½), Vasif Durarbayli (2–0), Vladimir Fedoseev (2–1) and a second match against Moussard (2–1). But he lost another match to Fedoseev (2½–1½) and then lost to Alexander Grischuk (2–1) and was eliminated from the tournament.

In August Nakamura participated as a wild card in the ten-player St. Louis Rapid and Blitz, part of the Grand Chess Tour. He compiled an even score in the rapid section of the tournament (+2−2=5) and a +3 score in the blitz section (+9−6=3). Overall he finished third in the tournament behind winner Alireza Firouzja and runner-up Wesley So. Nakamura played in Chess.com&#x27;s Speed Chess Championship in August and September. He qualified for the in-person semifinals by defeating Jose Martinez (14–8) and Ian Nepomniachtchi (14½–9½) in online matches. He lost his semifinal match to Alireza Firouzja (16–11) but won the consolation match against Hans Niemann (21–9) to take third place in the tournament.

Nakamura played in the Global Chess League, a rapid-play team event held in London in October. Playing on the top board for the American Gambits team, he compiled a +2 record (+3−1=6) including wins against Alireza Firouzja, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Viswanathan Anand. His team finished fourth in the six-team tournament. Also in October Nakamura played the Chess 9LX tournament at the St. Louis Chess Club, a ten-player rapid round-robin event in Fischer random chess. His record of 7/9 (+6−1=2) earned second place, but his sole loss against tournament winner Fabiano Caruana cost him the chance at first.

The World Rapid and Blitz Championships in December were a disappointment for Nakamura. He finished with 7.5/13 in rapid (+5-3=5) and 8.5/13 in blitz (+6-2=5) to end well behind the leaders in both events. During 2024 Nakamura frequently played in Chess.com&#x27;s online Titled Tuesday blitz tournaments. For the year he won more of the tournaments than any other player and earned the site&#x27;s Titled Cup award for 2024, 4.5 points ahead of five-time world champion Magnus Carlsen.

===2025: Freestyle Chess===
Nakamura&#x27;s first over-the-board event of 2025 was February&#x27;s Freestyle Chess tournament in Weissenhaus, Germany. This ten-player Fischer Random event consisted of a rapid-play round-robin followed by a series of playoff matches, which were played at classical time limits with rapid and blitz tiebreakers if necessary. Nakamura placed fifth in the round-robin with a +3-1=5 record that included wins against Fabiano Caruana, Vincent Keymar and Vladimir Fedoseev. He then lost his playoff match against Javokhir Sindarov (2.5-1.5) but won matches against Gukesh Dommaraju (2.5-1.5) and Nodirbek Abdusattorov (2-0) to finish fifth in the tournament.

Also in February Nakamura played in the online double-elimination Chessable Masters rapid tournament on chess.com. He won matches against Alexander Grischuk (2.5-0.5), Ian Nepomniachtchi (3-0) and Alireza Firouzja (3-2) but lost in the winners bracket final to Magnus Carlsen (2.5-0.5). He then faced Nepomniachtchi again in the losers bracket final. The match went to an Armageddon game where he drew with black and thus earned the victory (1.5-1.5) and a rematch with Carlsen in the tournament grand final. Nakamura lost the rematch (2.5-1.5) to finish second in the tournament and qualify for the Esports World Cup.

==Playing style==
Nakamura is particularly skilled at rapid and blitz chess, a variety of time controls in which players have less than an hour to complete all or most of their moves. In August 2022, Nakamura was ranked No. 1 on both the FIDE blitz list and the FIDE rapid list. He is also strong at bullet chess, a time control giving the players one minute each. In 2009, Nakamura authored the book &quot;Bullet Chess: One Minute to Mate&quot;. Nakamura said in September 2020, &quot;At least at blitz chess, I&#x27;m probably the best or second-best player ever, in the entire history, at least online.&quot;

Nakamura has been nicknamed &quot;The H Bomb&quot; because of his explosive style of playing. Nakamura&#x27;s long-time second is USCF National Master Kris Littlejohn, who works with chess engines to prepare lines for Nakamura to play.

==Chess records==
Nakamura has set several &quot;youngest-ever&quot; records in U.S. chess history, including:
*Youngest to defeat an International Master in a USCF-rated game (10 years, 0 months); later surpassed by Praveen Balakrishnan at 9 years 29 days, and then by Awonder Liang at 8 years 118 days;
*Youngest to defeat a Grandmaster in a USCF-rated game (10 years, 117 days); later surpassed by Fabiano Caruana at 10 years, 61 days; then surpassed by Awonder Liang at 9 years 112 days;
*Youngest International Master (13 years, 2 months); later surpassed by Ray Robson at 13 years, 1 month, by Samuel Sevian at 12 years, 10 months, and then by Awonder Liang at 12 years, 7 months and 6 days old.

==Internet activity==
Nakamura has played on the Internet Chess Club (ICC) (as &quot;Capilanobridge&quot;; formerly as &quot;Smallville&quot;) and Playchess (as &quot;Star Wars&quot;). He served as a commentator and game annotator on the ChessNinja website, operated by chess author Mig Greengard. Nakamura is sponsored by Chess.com, a chess website. 

In 2018, Nakamura began streaming on the platform Twitch under the name &quot;GMHikaru&quot;. He plays speed chess games, variously against grandmasters, other streamers, and viewers who pay to subscribe to his channel. He may play blindfolded or with piece handicaps, such as odds of a queen. He also reviews his tournament games on stream. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, chess became significantly more popular on Twitch, with Nakamura widely identified as a significant reason for this. His channel received a tenfold increase in audience size between February and June 2020. Around August 2020, Nakamura averaged 14,000 concurrent viewers and streamed on Twitch most days. By September 2020, he had reached 500,000 followers. Nakamura often plays games using &quot;joke openings&quot; while on stream, including the Bongcloud Attack, the Jerome Gambit and the Botez Gambit. Nakamura has stated that he prioritizes his streaming career over his chess playing career.

On August 27, 2020, Nakamura signed with the esports organization Team SoloMid (TSM) for a six-figure sum, making him one of the first chess players to join an esports team. On June 14, 2022, he joined Misfits Gaming as a content creator and influencer. On February 17, 2025, Nakamura signed with Team Falcons, who are rumored to have connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family.

Nakamura operates a Discord server named &quot;Naka&#x27;s PogUniversity&quot; and has a Twitter account. Nakamura also has a YouTube channel, which has 2,620,000 subscribers up from 78,900 subscribers in the beginning of 2020. When asked about his popularity online, Nakamura attributed it to &quot;the ability to play extremely high-level chess&quot; while &quot;seemingly ... not focused on the game&quot; and conversing with his viewers. Nathan Grayson of &quot;Kotaku&quot; called it a &quot;combination of teacherly wisdom, galaxy-brained skills, and uncommon expressiveness&quot;.

Nakamura has also coached beginner chess players on his Twitch platform, including the streamer xQc. He gave lessons to players in PogChamps, an amateur tournament for Twitch streamers hosted by Chess.com, and its sequel, PogChamps 2. He additionally provided commentary. At its peak, the tournament was the most-watched channel on Twitch for a short period, with 63,000 viewers. Nakamura told &quot;Kotaku&quot; that though the competition had been met with some criticism, he believed that such tournaments with varying levels of skills among players could become popular. On February 14, 2021, PogChamps 3 began. During the xQc vs. Rubius match on the second day of the event, chess hit its all-time high of 115,000 viewers in the chess category on Twitch.

On February 14, 2021, Nakamura reached a milestone of one million followers on his Twitch channel, GMHikaru. During the FIDE Grand Prix in March 2022, Twitch suspended Nakamura for three days (later reduced to two days) after he broadcast and commented on chess games being played by Dr Disrespect, who is permanently suspended from the streaming platform.

==Other activities==
Nakamura appeared as himself in season 5, episode 2 of the Showtime series &quot;Billions&quot;, which premiered May 10, 2020. Nakamura is also an active stock market investor. In April 2017 he appeared on Bloomberg Television to discuss the relationship between chess and stock trading. During his chess streams Nakamura occasionally discusses stock market investing and general financial topics.

==Personal life==
He married Atousa Pourkashiyan, a Woman Grandmaster, in 2023.

<text>The Chicago Great Western Railway was a Class I railroad that linked Chicago, Minneapolis, Omaha, and Kansas City. It was founded by Alpheus Beede Stickney in 1885 as a regional line between St. Paul and the Iowa state line called the Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad. Through mergers and new construction, the railroad, named Chicago Great Western after 1892, quickly became a multi-state carrier. One of the last Class I railroads to be built, it competed against several other more well-established railroads in the same territory, and developed a corporate culture of innovation and efficiency to survive.

Nicknamed the Corn Belt Route because of its operating area in the midwestern United States, the railroad was sometimes called the Lucky Strike Road, due to the similarity in design between the herald of the CGW and the logo used for Lucky Strike cigarettes.

In 1968 it merged with the Chicago and North Western Railway (CNW), which abandoned most of the CGW&#x27;s trackage.

==History==

===Predecessor railroads===
In 1835, the Chicago, St. Charles &amp; Mississippi Airline railroad was chartered with the intent of building a railroad west out of Chicago. The railroad never began construction, and its rights to build were transferred in 1854 to a new company, the Minnesota &amp; North Western (M&amp;NW), which eventually began construction in 1884 of a line south from St. Paul, Minnesota to Dubuque, Iowa. In 1887, the Chicago, St. Paul &amp; Kansas City Railroad acquired the M&amp;NW, and by the end of the decade, under the leadership of St. Paul businessman A.B. Stickney, it had established routes west to Omaha, Nebraska, south to St. Joseph, Missouri, and east to Chicago, Illinois, via the Winston Tunnel near Dubuque. In 1892, the railroad was reorganized as the Chicago Great Western.

===Early 20th century===

The first repair shops for locomotives and freight cars were built at the original terminus in St. Paul, Minnesota, known as the South Park Shops. In 1892 the city of Oelwein, Iowa was chosen as the headquarters and primary shop site due to its central location on the mainline. Construction was completed in 1899, and soon Oelwein became known as &quot;Shop City&quot; for its mammoth shop site. The two-story combination machine, boiler, and coach shop alone measured 700 feet (213 meters) long and had 27 pits for overhauling locomotives.

In 1907, the panic of 1907 caused Stickney to lose control of the railroad, and ownership passed to financier J. P. Morgan. In 1910, the CGW introduced four McKeen Motor Car Company self-propelled railcars, its first rolling stock powered by internal combustion engines. In the same year, the railroad also purchased ten large 2-6-6-2s from the Baldwin Locomotive Works. Two years later, the railroad acquired an experimental battery powered motorcar from the Federal Storage Battery Car Company. In 1916, the railroad began standardizing on 2-8-2 steam locomotives, which served through the 1920. In 1923 CGW purchased from the soon to be dominant company EMC, two of EMD&#x27;s first gasoline-powered cars. During the 1920s, as ownership changed again to the Bremo Corporation, a group of investors led by Patrick Joyce, an executive at the Standard Steel Car Company, the railroad expanded its use of self-propelled vehicles. At the end of the decade, 36 2-10-4 steam locomotives were purchased from Baldwin and the Lima Locomotive Works.

===Mid 20th century===
During the Great Depression, the railroad trimmed operations by closing facilities and abandoning trackage. It purchased its first diesel-electric locomotive, an yard switcher from Westinghouse, in 1934. In 1935, the CGW began trial operations of trailer on flatcar trains, which were expanded the following year into regular service, initially between Chicago and St. Paul, but rapidly expanding across the system by 1940. In 1941, it was reorganized in bankruptcy, and late in the decade a group of investors, organized as the Kansas City Group, purchased the CGW. In 1946, a demonstrator EMD F3 diesel locomotive set operated on the CGW, immediately prompting the company to purchase a wide variety of diesels, and by 1950 the railroad had converted completely to diesel motive power. In 1949, William N. Deramus III assumed the presidency, and began a program of rebuilding infrastructure and increasing efficiency, both by consolidating operations such as dispatching and accounting and by lengthening trains. In 1957, Deramus left the company, and Edward Reidy assumed the presidency.

===Merger===
As early as 1946, the first proposal was advanced to merge the Great Western with other railroads, this time with the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad and the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. Upon the failure of a later merger opportunity with the Soo Line Railroad in 1963, the board of the Great Western grew increasingly anxious about its continued viability in a consolidating railroad market. Testifying in 1965, before the Interstate Commerce Commission in Chicago, President Reidy statedthat although it was operating in the black it would not be able to continue: The simple fact is that there is just too much transportation available between the principal cities we serve. The Great Western cannot long survive as an independent carrier under these conditions.

The CGW, therefore, was open to a merger with the Chicago and North Western Railway (CNW), first proposed in 1964. After a 4-year period of opposition by other competing railroads, on July 1, 1968, the Chicago Great Western merged with Chicago and North Western. At the time of the merger, the CGW operated a system, over which it transported 2,452 million ton-miles of freight in 1967, largely food and agricultural products, lumber, and chemicals, for $28.7 million of revenue. After taking control of the CGW, the CNW abandoned most of the former CGW trackage.

===Trail conversion===
A 20 mile section of the railroad right of way from Des Moines, IA south to Martensdale, IA was used to create a mixed use trail with the name of Great Western Trail. In addition, a section of track was converted to trail usage, also known as the Great Western Trail, running intermittently between Villa Park, Illinois and West Chicago, Illinois in DuPage County, and then through Kane and DeKalb counties to Sycamore, Illinois.

==Passenger operations==

The Chicago Great Western was not known for its passenger trains, although it did operate several named trains, mostly running between Chicago and the Twin Cities. Despite the railroad&#x27;s small size and meager passenger fleet, it looked for ways to more efficiently move passengers, such as employing all-electric (battery powered) and gas-electric motorcars on light branch lines, which were cheaper to operate than traditional steam or diesel-powered trains. Notable passenger trains from its major terminals included:

* &quot;Blue Bird&quot; (Minneapolis/St. Paul–Rochester)
* &quot;Great Western Limited&quot; (Chicago–Minneapolis/St. Paul)
* &quot;Rochester Special&quot; (Minneapolis/St. Paul–Rochester)
* &quot;Red Bird&quot; (Minneapolis/St. Paul–Rochester)
* &quot;Legionnaire&quot; (Chicago–Minneapolis/St. Paul)
* &quot;Minnesotan&quot; (Chicago–Minneapolis/St. Paul)
* &quot;Mills Cities Limited&quot; (Kansas City–Minneapolis/St. Paul)
* &quot;Nebraska Limited&quot; (Minneapolis/St. Paul-Omaha)
* &quot;Omaha Express&quot; (Minneapolis/St. Paul-Omaha)
* &quot;Twin City Express&quot; (Omaha-Minneapolis/St. Paul)
* &quot;Twin City Limited&quot; (Omaha-Minneapolis/St. Paul)
* &quot;Maple Leaf Route&quot; (Minneapolis/St. Paul, Rochester, Stewartville, Racine, Spring Valley MN etc. to Chicago IL)

On September 30, 1965, the railroad ended passenger operations when the overnight trains between the Twin Cities and Omaha arrived at their respective endpoints.

<doc id="588184" wikidata="Q763018" url="?curid=588184" title="Yamaguchi-gumi">
<text>is Japan&#x27;s largest &quot;yakuza&quot; organization. It is named after its founder Harukichi Yamaguchi. Its origins can be traced back to a loose labor union for dockworkers in Kobe before World War II.

It is one of the largest criminal organizations in the world. According to the National Police Agency, it had 3,500 active members at the end of 2023.

The Yamaguchi-gumi are among the world&#x27;s wealthiest gangsters, bringing in billions of dollars a year from extortion, gambling, prostitution, arms trafficking, drug trafficking, real estate and construction kickback schemes. They are also involved in stock market manipulation and Internet pornography.

The Yamaguchi-gumi has its headquarters in Kobe, but it operates all across Japan and has overseas operations. Its current &quot;kumichō&quot; (Boss), Shinobu Tsukasa, has declared an expansionist policy—even making inroads into Tokyo, traditionally not Yamaguchi turf. They also have multiple groups working overseas.

==History==

===Relief support after disasters===
Immediately after the Kobe earthquake of 1995, the Yamaguchi-gumi started a large-scale relief effort for the earthquake victims, helping with the distribution of food and supplies. This help was essential to the Kobe population, because official support was inconsistent and chaotic for several days.

The Yamaguchi-gumi also provided relief in the wake of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami by opening its offices to the public and by sending supplies to affected areas.

===Newsletter===
In an effort to boost morale, the Yamaguchi-gumi launched an eight-page newsletter in July, 2013. However, it was only distributed to full members. The publication bridges communication gaps and includes articles on the group&#x27;s opinion and traditions, as well as columns on angling, with an editorial section written by Kenichi Shinoda.

===Assassination of Iccho Itoh===

On April 17, 2007, Tetsuya Shiroo, a senior ranking member of the Suishin-kai (an affiliated yakuza family to the Yamaguchi-gumi), assassinated Iccho Itoh, the mayor of Nagasaki, over an apparent dispute over damage done to Shiroo&#x27;s car at a public works construction site. On May 26, 2008, Tetsuya Shiroo was sentenced to death. However, the Fukuoka High Court revoked the death sentence and sentenced him to life imprisonment on September 29, 2009.

===Decline in membership===
&quot;Yakuza&quot; membership has been steadily declining since the 1990s. According to the National Police Agency, the total number of registered gangsters fell 14% between 1991 and 2012, to 78,600. Of those, 34,900 were Yamaguchi-gumi members, a decline of 4% from 2010. Its membership had further declined by 2013, with an estimated 28,000 members, and dropped again to 23,400 members in 2014.

===Split in 2015===
On August 27, 2015, Japanese police confirmed that powerful factions, including the Kobe-based Yamaken-gumi, the Osaka-based Takumi-gumi, and the Kyoyu-kai, broke away from the Yamaguchi-gumi and formed a new group called the Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi. Prior to the split, the organization consisted of seventy-two factions. This was the first major split since the forming of Ichiwa-Kai more than thirty years ago.

==Activities==
On January 14, 2021, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department arrested Hiroki Sakata, a member of the Yamaguchi-gumi, in connection with a scam in 2018 where the damage was worth 60 million yen ($475,059 US dollars in 2022).

==Leadership==
*1st &quot;kumichō&quot; (1915–1925): Harukichi Yamaguchi
*2nd &quot;kumichō&quot; (1925–1942): Noboru Yamaguchi, son of Harukichi Yamaguchi
*3rd &quot;kumichō&quot; (1946–1981): Kazuo Taoka

When Taoka inherited the title of &quot;kumichō&quot;, it was merely a local family with only a few dozen members. It was Taoka who made Yamaguchi-gumi Japan&#x27;s largest criminal organization. He urged his underlings to have legitimate businesses and allowed them to have their own families, which became quasi– subsidiary families of Yamaguchi-gumi. He also created a structural system in the family. &quot;Wakagashira&quot; were elected as underbosses to the &quot;kumichō&quot; and some powerful members were elected as &quot;wakagashira-hosa&quot; (deputy underbosses).

*4th &quot;kumichō&quot; (1984–1985): Masahisa Takenaka

After the death of Taoka, the heir apparent, &quot;wakagashira&quot; Kenichi Yamamoto (&quot;kumichō&quot; of the Yamaken-gumi), was serving a prison sentence. He died of liver failure shortly afterward. Taoka&#x27;s wife, Fumiko Taoka, stepped forward to fill the leadership void until a new &quot;kumichō&quot; could be selected by a council of eight top-level bosses. In 1984, the elders chose Masahisa Takenaka (&quot;kumichō&quot; of the Takenaka-gumi) to be the fourth &quot;kumichō&quot; of Yamaguchi-gumi. One of the other contenders, Hiroshi Yamamoto (&quot;kumichō&quot; of the Yamahiro-gumi), broke away from Yamaguchi-gumi with many of its powerful members and more than 3,000 of its soldiers to form the Ichiwa-kai. A bitter rivalry existed between the two groups, which led to an all-out war (the Yama-Ichi War) after the Ichiwa-kai&#x27;s 1985 assassination of Takenaka and &quot;wakahashira&quot; Katsumasa Nakayama. During the war, acting-&quot;kumichō&quot; Kazuo Nakanishi (&quot;kumichō&quot; of the Nakanishi-gumi) and &quot;wakagashira&quot; Yoshinori Watanabe (&quot;kumichō&quot; of the Yamaken-gumi) briefly took the leadership role until 1989.

*5th &quot;kumichō&quot; (1989–2005): Yoshinori Watanabe
The Yama-Ichi War ended with the retirement of Hiroshi Yamamoto, which was arbitrated by one of the most respected bosses, Seijo Inagawa. After that, the clan elected &quot;wakagashira&quot; Yoshinori Watanabe as 5th &quot;kumichō&quot; of the organization. Masaru Takumi (&quot;kumichō&quot; of Takumi-gumi) was elected as &quot;wakagashira&quot;. He was so powerful and respected within the organization that his influence overshadowed that of &quot;kumichō&quot; to some extent.

*6th &quot;kumichō&quot; (2005–present): Shinobu Tsukasa (real name: Kenichi Shinoda)

In 1997, then-powerful &quot;wakagashira&quot; Masaru Takumi was assassinated by underlings of then-&quot;wakagashira-hosa&quot; (deputy underboss) Taro Nakano. After this assassination, they were unable to choose a new &quot;wakagashira&quot; for more than eight years. As a result, leadership of the organization became weaker. Finally, in 2005, &quot;wakagashira-hosa&quot; Shinobu Tsukasa (then &quot;kumichō&quot; of the Hirota-gumi) was chosen as new &quot;wakagashira&quot; and shortly afterward, in August 2005, Tsukasa inherited the position of the 6th &quot;kumichō&quot; of the Yamaguchi-gumi.

Watanabe retired to private life—rather uncommon in &quot;yakuza&quot; circles, as bosses usually do not retire until their deaths. Under Tsukasa&#x27;s leadership, the 6th Yamaguchi-gumi has resumed expansion. Kiyoshi Takayama, &quot;kumichō&quot; of the Kodo-kai, was elected as &quot;wakagashira&quot;. They absorbed the Tokyo-based gang Kokusui-kai, acquiring lucrative turf in the capital. Tsukasa was imprisoned in December 2005 for illegal gun possession, and was released in April 2011 after serving nearly six years in jail.

==Sanctions==

In February 2012 the U.S. Treasury Department announced a freeze on American-owned assets controlled by the organization and its top two leaders. The Obama administration imposed sanctions on the Yamaguchi-gumi as one of four key transnational organized crime groups, along with the Brothers&#x27; Circle from Russia, the Camorra from Italy, and Los Zetas from Mexico.

==In popular culture==
* The main antagonist of the 1991 martial arts film &quot;The Godfather&#x27;s Daughter Mafia Blues&quot;, Kuyama (played by Ken Lo), is the current kumichō (or boss) of the Yamaguchi-gumi after the death of his father Tetsuya, who was the previous head of the syndicate. Unlike his father (who was known as a pacifist), Kuyama is an arrogant, greedy and reckless leader.
* In Marvel&#x27;s Earth-616, the Yamaguchi-gumi are notorious for being enemies of the Shogun Warriors and the X-Men&#x27;s Wolverine. The Yamaguchi-gumi had two known oyabuns in Earth-616: Maikeru Mishu (who was responsible for trying to steal and control the Shogun Warriors) and Shinji Kizaki (who became Wolverine&#x27;s enemy after he defeated one of Kizaki&#x27;s mercenaries and even insulted him before leaving Japan).
* The Yamaguchi-gumi are one of the main antagonists of &quot;Hitman 2: Silent Assassin&quot;. In the game, the Yamaguchi-gumi is led by Masahiro Hayamoto and his son Masahiro Hayamoto Jr., and both are priority targets for Agent 47
* In &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six: Take-Down – Missions in Korea&quot;, the Yamaguchi-gumi is involved in a bloody gang war with the Ikeshita-gumi (another powerful yakuza syndicate that owns territories in both Japan and South Korea and which are the main antagonists of the game).

<text>The Stills were a Canadian rock band from Montreal, Quebec, formed in 2000 and disbanded in 2011.

==History==
The band&#x27;s original lineup consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Tim Fletcher, guitarist Gregory Paquet, bassist Olivier Corbeil and drummer Dave Hamelin. The band members had known each other since the age of 12 and played in various bands prior to forming the Stills, including Chinatown, Amentum, and The Undercovers.

Their EP, &quot;Rememberese,&quot; was released on June 17, 2003, by Vice Records (and in the UK by 679 Recordings), followed by their debut album; both were produced by Gus Van Go. &quot;Logic Will Break Your Heart&quot; was released in North America on October 21, 2003, and in the UK on February 23, 2004, and included the singles &quot;Lola Stars and Stripes&quot;, &quot;Changes Are No Good&quot; and &quot;Still in Love Song&quot;. Keyboardist Liam O&#x27;Neil played on several of the album&#x27;s tracks. The album elicited critical acclaim and comparisons to Interpol and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, with AllMusic citing its &quot;brooding post-punk soundscapes and art rock swagger&quot;.

Paquet left the band in 2005 to finish his university degree, and Hamelin moved to guitar, sharing lead vocal duties with Fletcher. Julien Blais joined as drummer, and O&#x27;Neil became a full-time member of the band on keyboards.

The Stills&#x27; second album, &quot;Without Feathers&quot;, was released May 9, 2006, on Vice Records (and in the UK by Drowned in Sound Recordings). Again produced by Van Go, it marked a distinct shift in sound, from the 1980s-influenced post-punk revivalism of the debut to a happier, more Americana-oriented sound, which Pitchfork termed &quot;cheerful and heartfelt&quot;. It featured guest appearances from Sam Roberts, Emily Haines (Metric) and Jason Collett (Broken Social Scene). They supported Kings of Leon on that band&#x27;s UK spring tour in 2007; in the same year, they were featured, along with Karkwa, The Besnard Lakes and Mahjor Bidet, on the bill of Quebec Scene, a concert in Ottawa sponsored by CBC Radio 3.

They signed with Arts &amp; Crafts for the release of their third album, &quot;Oceans Will Rise,&quot; which was released August 19, 2008. Critics noted that the album &quot;reconciled the mannered 1980s sound that first got them noticed with the open-hearted earthiness of their sophomore effort&quot;.

On July 20, 2008, the Stills played in Quebec City, opening for Paul McCartney, for the city&#x27;s 400th anniversary. On February 7, 2009, they played at Nathan Phillips Square as part of Toronto&#x27;s WinterCity Festival, and again supported Kings of Leon on a tour of Australia and New Zealand in March 2009.

On March 28, 2009, the Stills were awarded two Juno Awards for their album &quot;Oceans Will Rise&quot;, in the categories of Best New Group and Best Alternative Album.

On April 29, 2010, the band announced that Paquet was rejoining the band and Hamelin was moving back to drums.

On April 15, 2011, the Stills announced on their site that they had officially disbanded.

==Other projects==
In 2009, Hamelin, O&#x27;Neil and Broken Social Scene drummer Justin Peroff formed the band Eight and a Half, releasing their self-titled debut in 2012.

O&#x27;Neil played various instruments on Kings of Leon&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Come Around Sundown&quot;, and is involved with hip-hop act Da Gryptions.

Fletcher sang background vocals on the Sam Roberts Band&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Lo-Fantasy&quot; and played guitar for Canadian rapper k-os. In 2014, he formed the band Beat Cops with Mikey Heppner of Priestess, releasing the album &quot;Mean Streets&quot; in 2015. That same year, Fletcher released the album &quot;Punks on the Moon&quot; with his project Voizes. Fletcher then formed Megative with ex-Stills producer Gus Van Go, songwriting duo Like Minds (Jesse Singer and Chris Soper) and dancehall performer Screechy Dan. In 2017, the ensemble debuted with the single &quot;More Time&quot;. On July 27, 2018, Megative released their self-titled debut album on Last Gang Records.

<text>Historical archaeology is a form of archaeology dealing with places, things, and issues from the past or present when written records and oral traditions can inform and contextualize cultural material. These records can both complement and conflict with the archaeological evidence found at a particular site. Studies focus on literate, historical- period societies as opposed to non-literate, prehistoric societies. While they may not have generated the records, the lives of people for whom there was little need for written records, such as the working class, slaves, indentured labourers, and children but who live in the historical period can also be the subject of study. The sites are found on land and underwater. Industrial archaeology, unless practiced at industrial sites from the prehistoric era, is a form of historical archaeology concentrating on the remains and products of industry and the Industrial era.

==Definition==

According to the overall definition given here based on methodological and theoretical aspects classical archaeology or Egyptology as well as medieval archaeology are disciplines of historical archaeology. In practice, however – mainly in the Americas – historical archaeology refers to the modern, post-1492 period, which in Europe is often referred to as post-medieval archaeology.

==Notable historical archaeologists==
*Judy Birmingham
*John L. Cotter
*James Deetz
*J. C. Harrington
*Ivor Noël Hume
*Mark P. Leone
*Stanley South

<text>Gaucho is the seventh studio album by the American rock band Steely Dan, released on November 21, 1980, by MCA Records. The album marked a significant stylistic shift for the band, with more focus on rhythm and atmosphere than their earlier work, but the recording sessions demonstrated the group&#x27;s typical obsessive nature and perfectionism, as they used at least 42 different session musicians, spent over a year in the studio, and far exceeded the original monetary advance given by the record label. At the 24th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Gaucho&quot; won Best Engineered Recording – Non-Classical, and was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

The making of the album was plagued by a number of creative, personal, and professional problems, and, once it was completed, there was a three-way legal battle between MCA, Warner Bros., and Steely Dan over the rights to release it. After the album was released, jazz pianist Keith Jarrett sued Walter Becker and Donald Fagen for copyright infringement, claiming the title track plagiarized Long As You Know You&#x27;re Living Yours&quot; from his 1974 album &quot;Belonging&quot;, and he was given a co-writing credit. Steely Dan did not release another studio album until &quot;Two Against Nature&quot;, nearly 20 years later.

==Background==
Exceptional difficulties plagued the album&#x27;s production. By 1978, Walter Becker and Donald Fagen had established themselves as the only two permanent members of Steely Dan and were using a revolving cast of session musicians to record the songs they wrote together. However, the pair&#x27;s working relationship began to become strained, largely because of Becker&#x27;s escalating drug use.

During the course of the recording sessions for &quot;Gaucho&quot;, Becker was hit by a car late one Saturday night while walking home to his apartment on the Upper West Side. He managed to push the woman he was with out of harm&#x27;s way, but sustained multiple fractures in one leg, a sprain in the other leg, and other injuries. During his six-month recovery, he suffered from secondary infections. While Becker was in the hospital, he and Fagen continued their musical collaborations via telephone.

Becker&#x27;s personal problems continued to mount when his girlfriend, Karen Roberta Stanley, died of a drug overdose at his home on January 30, 1980. Her family sued Becker for $17.5 million in January 1981, claiming that he had introduced Karen to cocaine, morphine, barbiturates, and heroin. The court later ruled in Becker&#x27;s favor.

==Recording==
===Recording sessions===
After recording Steely Dan&#x27;s first four albums entirely in Los Angeles, with 1976&#x27;s &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; Becker and Fagen began to record in New York City as well as L.A., and sessions for &quot;Gaucho&quot; began in New York in 1978. Many of the session musicians enlisted to play on the album were unenthusiastic about Becker and Fagen&#x27;s increasingly obsessive, perfectionist recording style. Mark Knopfler was hired to play the guitar solo on &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; on the strength of his playing on Dire Straits&#x27; hit single &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, and has described the session as long and gruelling. His playing features on more than half of the final track, though a commonly repeated myth states that his playing is only audible for about 15 seconds. Becker did not perform on the tracks &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot;, &quot;Glamour Profession&quot;, &quot;My Rival&quot;, or &quot;Third World Man&quot;.

The album&#x27;s mixing proved to be just as difficult as the recording. As an example, it took Becker, Fagen, recording engineer Roger Nichols, and producer Gary Katz more than 55 attempts to complete a satisfactory mix of the 50-second fade out of &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot;.

===Drum recording===
Even though the session musicians who played on &quot;Gaucho&quot; were amongst the most talented from both the East and West Coasts, Becker and Fagen were still not satisfied with the basic tracks for some of the songs, particularly with regard to the timing of the drum tracks. In a 2006 interview for &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, Fagen stated that he and Becker said to Nichols:
:&quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s too bad that we can&#x27;t get a machine to play the beat we want, with full-frequency drum sounds, and to be able to move the snare drum and kick drum around independently.&#x27; Nichols replied &#x27;I can do that.&#x27; This was back in 1978 or something, so we said &#x27;You can do that???&#x27; To which he said &#x27;Yes, all I need is $150,000.&#x27; So we gave him the money out of our recording budget, and six weeks later he came in with this machine and that is how it all started.&quot;

Nichols named the drum machine &quot;Wendel&quot;. When &quot;Gaucho&quot; sold one million copies, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) awarded Wendel its own Platinum record. According to a 2021 interview with recording engineer Elliot Scheiner, who recorded the rhythm section tracks for Gaucho, the Wendel drum machine was used for the basic drum beats on &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot;, &quot;Glamour Profession&quot;, and &quot;My Rival&quot;. Drum fills for these tracks were played live by the drummer credited for the track. Scheiner said in the same interview that &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot;, &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, and &quot;Third World Man&quot; did not use the &quot;Wendel&quot; machine. (Scheiner was not asked about the drums on the title song, &quot;Gaucho&quot;.) According to Ken Micallef in an article in &quot;Modern Drummer&quot;, the drum track for the title song was assembled from 46 different takes. The drummer on the session, Jeff Porcaro, has been quoted as saying:
:&quot;From noon till six we&#x27;d play the tune over and over and over again, nailing each part. We&#x27;d go to dinner and come back and start recording. They made everybody play like their life depended on it. But they weren&#x27;t gonna keep anything anyone else played that night, no matter how tight it was. All they were going for was the drum track.&quot;

Drummer Bernard Purdie plays his signature half-time shuffle beat, the &quot;Purdie Shuffle&quot;, on &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot;.

===Outtakes and bootlegs===
A number of songs were written for the album, but not included in the final release. Some of these were included on a bootleg album titled &quot;The Lost Gaucho&quot;, which features recordings from early in the &quot;Gaucho&quot; sessions. Song titles include &quot;Kind Spirit&quot;, &quot;Kulee Baba&quot;, &quot;The Bear&quot;, &quot;Talkin&#x27; About My Home&quot;, and &quot;The Second Arrangement&quot;. An early version of &quot;Third World Man&quot;, dating from the &quot;Aja&quot; sessions and with alternate lyrics, is included on &quot;The Lost Gaucho&quot; under the title &quot;Were You Blind That Day&quot;.

&quot;The Second Arrangement&quot; was one of Katz and Nichols&#x27; favorite songs from the &quot;Gaucho&quot; sessions. In late December 1979, after weeks of working on a particular version of the song, approximately three-quarters of the track was accidentally erased by an assistant engineer, who had been asked by Katz to ready it for listening. The band attempted to re-record the track, but eventually abandoned the song entirely, focusing instead, according to Steely Dan biographer Brian Sweet, on &quot;Third World Man&quot;. During a guitar clinic in 2011, Larry Carlton said of &quot;Third World Man&quot;:
:&quot;When &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine came out ... about Gaucho, it&#x27;s writing about the news &#x27;Steely Dan released ... bla bla bla ... and great guitar solo by Larry Carlton&#x27;, and I said, &#x27;but I didn&#x27;t play on &quot;Gaucho&quot;!, they&#x27;d cut it in New York, I didn&#x27;t play on it!&#x27;. So I found out later: they had finished mixing in New York, and one of the second engineers erased one of their master tracks. So &quot;Third World Man&quot; was in the can from &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; and they had to reach back into the old tapes and find something to finish the album, and that&#x27;s how I ended up on &quot;Gaucho&quot; playing &quot;Third World Man&quot;.

Steely Dan did not perform &quot;The Second Arrangement&quot; live until a rarities show on September 17, 2011, and a studio recording of the song has never been officially released, though several demo and outtake recordings of the song exist in bootleg form. In 2020, Cimcie Nichols, the daughter of Roger Nichols, said the family had discovered three cassettes that might include rough mixes of &quot;The Second Arrangement&quot;. The possibility proved to be an actuality, and Roger Nichols&#x27; tape (and a second DAT version) were preserved in September 2021 and March 2023, and released in June 2023 in the Substack newsletter &quot;Expanding Dan&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
According to Mike Powell of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, &quot;Gaucho&quot; combines &quot;bitter, poetic cynicism with freewheeling jazz-rock&quot;, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic says it &quot;essentially replicates the smooth jazz-pop of &quot;Aja&quot;, but with none of that record&#x27;s dark, seductive romance or elegant aura&quot;. Similarly, rock historian Joe Stuessy suggested it was one in a series of Steely Dan albums that showed a progression of jazz influences in the band&#x27;s sound, which was often described as &quot;jazz-rock fusion&quot;. Music journalist and broadcaster Paul Sexton wrote that, while &quot;Aja&quot; had &quot;announced [Steely Dan&#x27;s] ever-greater exploration of jazz influences&quot;, &quot;Gaucho&quot; is &quot;their yacht rock masterpiece&quot;. In connection with the latter genre, Timothy Malcolm of &quot;Houstonia&quot; magazine said the album features &quot;a number of yachty delights&quot;, and Erlewine highlighted the title track as exemplary of the genre. Patrick Hosken of MTV News said that, like &quot;Aja&quot;, &quot;Gaucho&quot; shows how &quot;great yacht rock is also more musically ambitious than it might seem, tying blue-eyed soul and jazz to funk and R&amp;B&quot;.

Hal Leonard&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Steely Dan&quot; describes &quot;Gaucho&quot; as &quot;a concept album of seven interrelated tales about would-be hipsters.&quot; According to Ian MacDonald, &quot;Two songs are about hookers, two more concern the doings of coke dealers, and a fifth depicts the denouement of a seedy marital dispute. What redeems it all is the humour and artistry. Lyrics exude class as well as underclass, while the music, whatever its guise or disguise, is immaculate&quot;. The lyrics of &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot; are about an aging hipster attempting to pick up a girl who is so young that she does not recognize &quot;&#x27;Retha Franklin&quot; playing on the stereo, and the song closes with the ambiguous line, &quot;The Cuervo Gold, the fine Colombian, make tonight a wonderful thing&quot;, leaving it up to the listener whether the narrator is consuming tequila and drugs with the love interest, or if he is alone. Stewart Mason of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; is &quot;a barely veiled song about heroin, specifically a young man&#x27;s first experience with the drug at the hands of a pretentious, pseudo-religious crank talking of &#x27;chasing the dragon&#x27; with the &#x27;mystical sphere direct from Lhasa&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Record World&quot; said that the song &quot;offers an aural array of rich keyboard/guitar figures.&quot;

===Keith Jarrett lawsuit===
Following the release of &quot;Gaucho&quot; in 1980, it was noticed that &quot;Gaucho&quot;″s title track, credited to Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, bore a resemblance to jazz pianist Keith Jarrett&#x27;s instrumental Long As You Know You&#x27;re Living Yours&quot; from his 1974 album &quot;Belonging&quot;. When asked about this during an interview with &quot;Musician&quot; magazine, Becker replied that he loved the Jarrett composition, while Fagen said &quot;we were heavily influenced by that particular piece of music.&quot; After these comments were published, Jarrett sued for copyright infringement, and Becker and Fagen were legally obliged to add his name to the credits and provide Jarrett with publishing royalties.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover art is based upon a low relief sculpture by Argentine artist Israel Hoffmann. Entitled &quot;Guardia Vieja – Tango&quot; (Old Guard – Tango), the original is located in a street museum known as Caminito in La Boca, a neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

==Marketing and sales==
MCA made the album, along with &quot;Hard Promises&quot; by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and the &quot;Xanadu&quot; soundtrack by Olivia Newton-John and Electric Light Orchestra, a test case for its new &quot;superstar pricing&quot; policy, whereby new albums by top-selling artists would sell for one dollar more than those of other artists ($9.98, rather than $8.98). Steely Dan was opposed to this idea, fearful that their fans would blame them for the higher price.

In the United States, &quot;Gaucho&quot; reached number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, and it has been certified Platinum by the RIAA. In the UK, the album reached number 27 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot; reached number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the single topped the charts in Canada.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, the album was met with mostly positive reviews. Ariel Swartley of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said: &quot;After years of hibernation in the studio, the metamorphosis that began with &quot;The Royal Scam&quot; is complete. Steely Dan have perfected the aesthetic of the tease.&quot; John Griffin of &quot;The Gazette&quot; wrote that &quot;The music is perfection throughout&quot; the album. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave &quot;Gaucho&quot; a positive review, and later ranked it ahead of such albums as &quot;Remain in Light&quot; by Talking Heads and &quot;Closer&quot; by Joy Division as the best album of 1980.

On the other hand, Pete Bishop of &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; found &quot;Gaucho&quot; &quot;too well-crafted, too artificially sophisticated&quot;, and lacking in spontaneity. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; remarked that &quot;Even the song with Aretha in it lends credence to rumors that the LP was originally entitled &quot;Countdown to Lethargy&quot;&quot;, referring to &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot; and its lyric about &quot;&#x27;Retha Franklin&quot;. The album received a rating of 1 star out of 5 in the second edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (1983), in which critic Dave Marsh called it &quot;the kind of music that passes for jazz in Holiday Inn lounges, with the kind of lyrics that pass for poetry in freshman English classes.&quot;

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Gaucho&quot;, while sonically similar to &quot;Aja&quot;, features musical performances that have been overly rehearsed to the point of lacking emotional resonance, as well as inferior songwriting, except for the highlights &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot;, &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, and &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot;, which &quot;make the remainder of the album&#x27;s glossy, meandering fusion worthwhile&quot;. David Sakowski of &quot;PopMatters&quot; reappraised the album as a &quot;classic&quot; that was largely &quot;lost in the shadow of &quot;Aja&quot; and the changing tides of music&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Gaucho&quot; was voted number 504 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

===Accolades===
At the 24th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Gaucho&quot; won Best Engineered Recording – Non-Classical, and was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

<text>Landscape design is an independent profession and a design and art tradition, practiced by landscape designers, combining nature and culture. In contemporary practice, landscape design bridges the space between landscape architecture and garden design.

==Design scope==
Landscape design focuses on both the integrated master landscape planning of a property and the specific garden design of landscape elements and plants within it. The practical, aesthetic, horticultural, and environmental sustainability are also components of landscape design, which is often divided into hardscape design and softscape design. Landscape designers often collaborate with related disciplines such as architecture, civil engineering, surveying, landscape contracting, and artisan specialties.

Design projects may involve two different professional roles: landscape design and landscape architecture.
* Landscape design typically involves artistic composition and artisanship, horticultural finesse and expertise, and emphasis on detailed site involvement from conceptual stages through to final construction.
* Landscape architecture focuses more on urban planning, city and regional parks, civic and corporate landscapes, large scale interdisciplinary projects, and delegation to contractors after completing designs. 
There can be a significant overlap of talent and skill between the two roles, depending on the education, licensing, and experience of the professional. Both landscape designers and landscape architects practice landscape design.

==Design approach==

The landscape design phase consists of research, gathering ideas, and setting a plan. Design factors include objective qualities such as: climate and microclimates; topography and orientation, site drainage and groundwater recharge; municipal and resource building codes; soils and irrigation; human and vehicular access and circulation; recreational amenities (i.e., sports and water); furnishings and lighting; native plant habitat botany when present; property safety and security; construction detailing; and other measurable considerations.

Design factors also include subjective qualities such as genius loci (the special site qualities to emphasize); client&#x27;s needs and preferences; desirable plants and elements to retain on site, modify, or replace, and that may be available for borrowed scenery from beyond; artistic composition from perspectives of both looking upon and observing from within; spatial development and definition – using lines, sense of scale, and balance and symmetry; plant palettes; and artistic s for enjoyment. There are innumerable other design factors and considerations brought to the complex process of designing a garden that is beautiful, well-functioning, and that thrives over time.

The up-and-coming practice of online landscape design allows professional landscapers to remotely design and plan sites through manipulation of two-dimensional images without ever physically visiting the location. Due to the frequent lack of non-visual, supplementary data such as soil assessments and pH tests, online landscaping necessarily must focus on incorporating only plants which are tolerant across many diverse soil conditions.

==Training==

Historically, landscape designers trained by apprenticing—such as André Le Nôtre, who apprenticed with his father before designing the Gardens of Versailles—to accomplished masters in the field, with the titular name varying and reputation paramount for a career. The professional section of garden designers in Europe and the Americas went by the name &quot;Landscape Gardener&quot;. In the 1890s, the distinct classification of landscape architect was created, with educational and licensing test requirements for using the title legally. Beatrix Farrand, the sole woman in the founding group, refused the title preferring Landscape Gardener. Matching the client and technical needs of a project, and the appropriate practitioner with talent, legal qualifications, and experienced skills, surmounts title nomenclature.

Institutional education in landscape design appeared in the early 20th century. Over time it became available at various levels. Ornamental horticulture programs with design components are offered at community college and universities within schools of agriculture or horticulture, with some beginning to offer garden or landscape design certificates and degrees. Departments of landscape architecture are located within university schools of architecture or environmental design, with undergraduate and graduate degrees offered. Specialties and minors are available in horticultural botany, horticulture, natural resources, landscape engineering, construction management, fine and applied arts, and landscape design history. Traditionally, hand-drawn drawings documented the design and position of features for construction, but Landscape design software is frequently used now.

Other routes of training are through informal apprenticeships with practicing landscape designers, landscape architects, landscape contractors, gardeners, nurseries and garden centers, and docent programs at botanical and public gardens. Since the landscape designer title does not have a college degree or licensing requirements to be used, there is a very wide range of sophistication, aesthetic talent, technical expertise, and specialty strengths to be responsibly matched with specific client and project requirements.

==Gardening==

Many landscape designers have an interest and involvement with gardening, personally or professionally. Gardens are dynamic and not static after construction and planting are completed, and so in some ways are &quot;never done&quot;. Involvement with landscape management and direction of the ongoing garden direction, evolution, and care depend on the professional&#x27;s and client&#x27;s needs and inclinations. As with the other interrelated landscape disciplines, there can be an overlap of services offered under the titles of landscape designer or professional gardener.

<text>Silvestre Revueltas Sánchez (December 31, 1899 – October 5, 1940) was a Mexican classical music composer, a violinist, and conductor.

==Life==
Revueltas was born in Santiago Papasquiaro in Durango, and studied at the National Conservatory in Mexico City, St. Edward&#x27;s University in Austin, Texas, and the Chicago College of Music. He gave violin recitals and in 1929 was invited by Carlos Chávez to become assistant conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra of Mexico, a post he held until 1935. He and Chávez did much to promote contemporary Mexican music. It was around this time that Revueltas began to compose in earnest. He began his first film score, &quot;Redes&quot;, in 1934, a commission which resulted in Revueltas and Chávez falling out. Chávez had originally expected to write the score, but political changes led to him losing his job in the Ministry of Education, which was behind the film project. Revueltas left Chávez&#x27;s orchestra in 1935 to be the principal conductor of a newly created and short-lived rival orchestra, the &quot;Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional&quot;.
He was a member of the Revueltas Sánchez family, a number of whom were also famous and recognized in Mexico: his brother Fermín (1901–1935) and sister Consuelo (born before 1908, died before 1999) were painters, sister Rosaura (ca. 1909–1996) was an actress and dancer, and younger brother José Revueltas (1914–1976) was a noted writer. His nephew Román Revueltas Retes, son of José, is a violinist and conductor.
In 1937 Revueltas went to Spain during the Spanish Civil War, as part of a tour organized by the leftist organization Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (LEAR); upon Francisco Franco&#x27;s victory, he returned to Mexico. He earned little, and fell into poverty and alcoholism. He died in Mexico City of pneumonia (complicated by alcoholism), at the age of 40 on October 5, 1940, the day his ballet &quot;El renacuajo paseador&quot;, written four years earlier, was premiered. In 1976, his remains were transferred to the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres in Mexico City.

==Works==
Revueltas wrote film music, chamber music, songs, and a number of other works. His best-known work is the 1960 arrangement by drawn from Revueltas&#x27; film score for the 1939 film &quot;La noche de los mayas&quot;, although some dissenting opinions hold that the orchestral work &quot;Sensemayá&quot; is better known. In any case, it is &quot;Sensemayá&quot; that is considered Revueltas&#x27;s masterpiece.

He appeared briefly as a bar piano player in the movie &quot;¡Vámonos con Pancho Villa!&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s Go with Pancho Villa&quot;, Mexico, 1935), for which he composed the music. When shooting breaks out in the bar while he is playing &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;, he holds up a sign reading &quot;Se suplica no tirarle al pianista&quot; (&quot;We beg you not to shoot at the pianist&quot;).

<text>Augustus Frederic Rudolf Hoernlé CIE (1841 – 1918), also referred to as Rudolf Hoernle or A. F. Rudolf Hoernle, was a German Indologist and philologist. He is famous for his studies on the Bower Manuscript (1891), Weber Manuscript (1893) and other discoveries in northwestern China and Central Asia particularly in collaboration with Aurel Stein. Born in India to a Protestant missionary family from Germany, he completed his education in Switzerland, and studied Sanskrit in the United Kingdom. He returned to India, taught at leading universities there, and in the early 1890s published a series of seminal papers on ancient manuscripts, writing scripts and cultural exchange between India, China and Central Asia. His collection after 1895 became a victim of forgery by Islam Akhun and colleagues in Central Asia, a forgery revealed to him in 1899. He retired from the Indian office in 1899 and settled in Oxford, where he continued to work through the 1910s on archaeological discoveries in Central Asia and India. This is now referred to as the &quot;Hoernle collection&quot; at the British Library.

==Life==
Rudolf Hoernle was born in Sikandra, near Agra, British India on 14 November 1841, the son of a German Protestant missionary family. His father Christian Theophilus Hoernle (1804–1882) had translated the gospels into Kurdish and Urdu, and came from a family with a history of missionary activity and social activism in southwest Germany. Hoernle at age 7 was sent to Germany to be with his grandparents for his education.

Hoernlé attended school in Switzerland, then completed theological studies in Schönthal and the University of Basel. He attended theological college in London in 1860, studying Sanskrit under Theodor Goldstucker from 1864 to 1865.

He was ordained in 1864, and became a member of the Church Missionary Society. He returned to India in 1865 as a missionary posted in Mirat. He requested a transfer from active missionary service, and accepted a teaching position at the Jay Narayan college in Varanasi (Benares Hindu University), coming in contact with Dayanand Saraswati of the Arya Samaj movement. In 1878, he moved to Cathedral Mission College in West Bengal as its Principal (University of Calcutta). He joined the Indian Education Service, where the Government engaged his services to inspect coins and archaeological deposits, a role expanded to the study of discoveries related to India in Central Asian archaeological sites. 

Hoernlé was elected the President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1897. In 1899, at age 58, he retired and settled in Oxford. He continued to publish his studies from Oxford, including his &quot;Studies in the Medicine of Ancient India&quot; in 1907. He died on 12 November 1918 from influenza.

==Work==

Hoernlé spent nearly his entire working life engaged in the study of Indo-Aryan languages. His first paper appears in 1872, on the comparative grammar of Gauri languages. In 1878, he published a book on the comparative grammar of north Indian languages, which established his reputation as an insightful philologist as well as won him the Volney Prize of the Institut de France. During the 1880s, he published numerous notes and articles on numismatics and epigraphy in the &quot;Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal&quot; and the &quot;Indian Antiquary&quot;, along with translations of medieval era Hindu and Jain Sanskrit texts.

His first fame to deciphering ancient archaic Indian scripts came with the Bakhshali manuscript, which was a fragmented pieces of a manuscript found in 1881. The fragments remained an undeciphered curiosity for a few years till it was sent to Hoernle. He deciphered it, and showed it to be a portion of a lost ancient Indian arithmetical treatise.
Hoernle is perhaps best known for his decipherment of the Bower Manuscript collected by Hamilton Bower in Kucha (Chinese Turkestan). Bower found the birch-bark manuscript in 1890 and it was sent to Hoernle in early 1891. Within months, Hoernle had deciphered and translated it, establishing it to be a medical treatise and the oldest known manuscript from ancient India. His fame led the British India government to seek more manuscripts and archaeological items from Xinjiang (China) and Central Asia, sending him 23 consignments of discoveries before he retired. 

In 1893, Hoernle deciphered the Weber manuscript – one of the oldest preserved Sanskrit texts on paper. He identified the chronological evolution of Brahmi script, early Gupta script and a host of other scripts along with the nature of substrate they were written on (birch-bark, palm-leaf, paper).

He was an early scholar of Khotanese and Tocharian languages, which he had sensed as a different Indo-Aryan language in some of the texts that formed the Weber manuscript. 

===Victim of forgery===
As his breakthrough studies gained fame, various governments including the British government sought and offered handsome rewards for ancient manuscripts. This led to major forgeries, and Hoernlé was deceived by some. Hoernle was concerned about potential for forgery, as some of the fragmentary manuscripts he received appeared to contain Central Asian scripts but made no sense in any language. Hoernle tended to assume good faith and spent time analyzing, making sense of them. In past, his patience with the unknown languages ultimately led to the discovery of Khotanese and Tocharian languages.

The first forged manuscript came from Islam Akhun, purchased by George Macartney and sent to Hoernle in 1895. Thereafter several more Akhun manuscripts followed. According to Peter Hopkirk, Backlund stationed in Central Asia wrote to Hoernle, informing him of his suspicions about Akhun&#x27;s forgery, and reasons to doubt purchases from Akhun. However, Hoernle found reasons to dismiss Backlund&#x27;s concerns and continue his analysis of manuscripts sold by Akhun, stating &quot;if these are copies freshly produced, then they are copies of ancient manuscripts&quot; just like reprints of old books.

In a preliminary report in 1897, Hoernle wrote about the new manuscripts he had received from Khotan, the following:

Thereafter, he published &quot;A Collection of Antiquities from Central Asia: Part 1&quot; on them. The truth about the forged manuscripts by Islam Akhun was confirmed during a site visit to Khotan by the explorer and long term collaborator Sir Aurel Stein and revealed to Hoernle. Stein found many manuscript fragments similar to the Bower and Weber manuscripts in different parts of Central Asia but found nothing remotely similar to those sold by Islam Akhun and ultimately delivered through Macartney to Hoernle since 1895. Stein visited Akhun in person, wasn&#x27;t able to verify any of the sites Akhun had previously claimed to be the source of his elaborate manuscripts. Akhun first tried to offer alternative explanations, but his workers and he ultimately confessed to the fraud. Stein saw the forgery operations and discovered that Hoernle&#x27;s good faith was wrong. Akhun and his workers never had any ancient manuscripts they were making copies from. Stein reported his findings to Hoernlé, who was deeply dismayed by the forgeries and his error, and upset. He considered acquiring and destroying Part 1 of his report. It had already been widely distributed after being published as a special number of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, and Stein had already disclosed the forgery that formed that collection. Hoernle went ahead and published Part 2, glossing over his personal errors in Part 1, according to Peter Hopkirk. Hoernle did include a note for the benefit of all scholars, stating: 
Hoernlé retired after publishing his 1899 report, his reputation survived this revelation, and his obituaries in 1918 tactfully omitted the incident, according to Kirk.

===Hoernle collection, British Library===
In 1902, the Government of India restarted sending consignments to Hoernle, now based in Oxford. He received 12 consignments, which ultimately were transferred to the Indian Office Library in London in 1918, and are now a part of the British Library&#x27;s Hoernle collections. Hoernle also received all material collected by Aurel Stein during his 1st and 2nd expedition to Central Asia, now split between the British Library and the Delhi Museum. The volume of shipments from India to Hoernle in Oxford increased so much that he could not process them alone. Many Indologists at Oxford helped him sort, catalog and study them. His collaborators between 1902 and 1918 included &quot;F.W. Thomas, L.D. Barnett, H. Lüders, S. Konow, E. Leumann, K. Watanabe, and S. Lévi&quot;, states Sims-Williams. During this period, Hoernle and these scholars made significant progress in understanding the scope and scale of Indian literature found in Central Asia, Tibet and South Asia. Hoernle, thus, continued to make his contributions to Indology and published many articles from Oxford during these years. The Hoernle collection of the British Library includes over 4000 Sanskrit, 1298 Tocharian and 200 Khotanese manuscripts.

===Hoernle collection, Otani University===
In 1920, the Japanese Sanskrit scholar, monk, and later professor at Ōtani University Izumi Hōkei (1884-1947) discovered in a Cambridge bookstore a collection of 431 books from Hoernlé&#x27;s former possession on Buddhism, medicine, languages, and literature. This collection is now kept in the library of Ōtani University (Kyoto).

===Two-wave Indo-Aryan migration===
Hoernle proposed the two-wave theory of the Indo-Aryan migration. According to this theory, Aryans invaded the subcontinent first through Kabul valley, then much later in a second invasion, the Aryans arrived in much larger numbers into a more drier climatic period moving and settling into the Gangetic plains. The second invasion, he proposed, occurred before the &quot;Rigveda&quot; was composed and before the earliest version of the Sanskrit language took a form. The first invaders spoke Magadhi, the second spoke Sauraseni, according to Hoernle. This theory was adopted by later scholars such as George Abraham Grierson. 

In addition to his palaeographical and codicological work, Hoernlé published an important series of editions and studies on the history of medicine in South Asia, including a magisterial edition, translation and study of the Bower Manuscript.

===World War I===
Hoernle, of German heritage and living his retirement in England, was deeply dismayed by World War I.

==Honours==
In February 1902 he received the honorary degree Master of Arts (MA) from the University of Oxford.

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1897.

==Family==
Hoernlé was the second of nine children. 
In 1877 Hoernlé married Sophie Fredericke Louise Romig; the philosopher Alfred Hoernlé was their son.

<text>Kisangani (), formerly Stanleyville (), is the capital of Tshopo Province, located on the Congo River in the eastern part of the central Congo Basin in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is the country&#x27;s fifth-most populous urban area, with an estimated population of 1,602,144 as of 2016, and the largest of the cities in the tropical woodlands of the Congo. 

Geographically, Kisangani is flanked by Banalia Territory to the north, Bafwasende to the east, Ubundu Territory to the south, and is bordered by both Opala and Isangi Territories to the west. The city spans an area of 1,910 square kilometers and is situated within the equatorial forest plain at coordinates 0°30&#x27; north latitude and 25°20&#x27; east longitude, just 80 kilometers from the equator. Kisangani is located approximately 2,100 kilometers (1,300 miles) from the mouth of the Congo River, making it the farthest navigable point upstream.

Kisangani is administratively divided into six communes. Five communes—Kabondo, Kisangani, Makiso, Mangobo, and Tshopo—are strategically situated on the right bank, while the Lubunga commune is on the left bank.

Kisangani is the nation&#x27;s most important inland port after Kinshasa, an important commercial hub point for river and land transportation and a major marketing and distribution centre for the north-eastern part of the country. It has been the commercial capital of the northern Congo since the late 19th century.

== History ==

=== Early history and the founding of Stanley Falls Station ===
Before Henry Morton Stanley, working on behalf of King Leopold II of the Belgians, founded what would become Stanley Falls Station in 1883, the area was inhabited by Wagenya, who used Wagenia Falls (which was formerly named Stanley Falls) for fishing. The station was founded on the Island of Wana Rusari, a few meters from the contemporary site of Kisangani, along the Lualaba River. This area, characterized by its seven falls spanning between Kisangani and Ubundu, was first traversed by Stanley in 1877 after navigating the rapids and falls that impeded further upstream navigation, mistakenly believing he was descending the Nile River. He documented that approximately a thousand fish in Stanley Falls, each weighing between two and twenty kilograms, were caught daily, with the Wagenya maintaining significant reserves of smoked fish for trade. The trade network extended beyond foodstuffs to include canoes, fishing nets, pottery, wooden utensils, and metallic objects crafted by specialized artisans, often from distinct ethnic groups, such as the Ramangas, renowned for their expertise in canoe and wooden furniture manufacturing. Stanley returned to the region on 1 December 1883, to establish the initial trading post in the region, situated approximately from the Congo River&#x27;s mouth, following negotiations with Arab-Swahili traders who had settled in the area the previous year. The station, designated as the ultimate destination of the expedition, was commissioned by the Comité d&#x27;études du Haut-Congo. Stanley was accompanied by two Scottish engineers, a German mechanic, and a sailor from Stanleyville, with Scottish engineer Adrian Binnie assuming the role of station director.

Initially referred to as Falls Station or &quot;The Post Stanley Falls,&quot; &quot;The Falls,&quot; or colloquially &quot;Boyoma&quot; (the indigenous name for Boyoma Falls), the settlement was consistently identified as &quot;Kisangani&quot; by the local populace, while Europeans commonly used the French term &quot;Stanleyville&quot; (or Stanleystad in Dutch). The Swahili language manual published by the Marist Brothers in the 1920s provides an instance of this naming substitution: &quot;from X to Stanleyville&quot; is translated as &quot;toka X Mpaka Kisangani&quot;. The name &quot;Kisangani&quot; is a Swahili interpretation of the indigenous term &quot;Boyoma&quot;, denoting &quot;City on the Island,&quot; and is similarly rendered in Lingala as &quot;Singitini&quot; (or &quot;Singatini&quot;). Stanley subsequently journeyed to Bas-Congo (modern-day Kongo Central Province) and entrusted the settlement to Adrian Binnie, who, alongside twenty Hausa and ten Wangwana, became the principal representative of King Leopold II&#x27;s Congo Free State in the region. Binnie expanded Stanley&#x27;s holdings, clearing land and constructing a village, complete with gardens.

=== Congo Arab War ===

Following the establishment of relations between the local African communities and European traders, Arab-Swahili slave traders from Zanzibar—commonly referred to as &quot;Arabs&quot; in contemporary European accounts—reached Stanley Falls from the east. Relations between Free State officials and the slavers were fraught with tension. In October 1884, Lieutenant Arvid Wester, who had succeeded Binnie as the station&#x27;s overseer, brokered a treaty with the Arab Swahili slavers. The treaty, signed by a son of the infamous Afro-Omanis slave trader Tippu Tip, was intended to curb slave raiding and foster peaceful relations with whites in the region. However, the treaty was short-lived, as Tippu Tip&#x27;s forces soon resumed their activities, which exacerbated tensions. The natives simultaneously placed themselves under the protection of the International Association of the Congo, albeit without success.

By January 1885, Captain Alphonse van Gèle arrived at Stanley Falls, following his exploration of the Ubangi River, only to discover that Tippu Tip had devastated the surrounding area and, on behalf of the Sultan of Zanzibar, repudiated the treaty. This incident marked the onset of the Congo Arab War, during which the eastern shore of the Congo Free State became a battleground for control over the lucrative Arab slave trade. To protect Stanley Falls Station, Walter Deane, an officer dispatched by Francis de Winton, arrived with a contingent of thirty-two Hausa soldiers and forty Bangala auxiliaries. Although they were promised an ample supply of ammunition and reinforcements, these resources never materialized. The situation deteriorated in mid-July 1886 with the return of Tippu Tip to Zanzibar, leaving his brother-in-law and business partner, Bwana Nzige, and Nzige&#x27;s son, Rashid, to oversee their operations in the region. When an enslaved woman from a nearby village, who had been cruelly flogged by her Arab Swahili master, sought refuge in Deane&#x27;s camp, tensions reached a boiling point. Deane refused to return the woman to her master, offering to pay her ransom instead. This act of defiance incited Tippu Tip&#x27;s men, who accused Deane of stealing the woman. Although threatened, Deane was not immediately attacked until the arrival of a river steamer, which brought only one Belgian officer, Lieutenant Dubois, but none of the promised reinforcements or supplies. A large force of Manyema crossed from the mainland at night to assault the station. Despite holding out for three days, the defenders were eventually overwhelmed as their ammunition dwindled, resulting in the deaths of seven Hausas, while the Bangala auxiliaries fled, promising to inform the authorities as they retreated downriver. On 26 August 1886, Deane and Dubois set fire to the station and sought refuge in the surrounding woods. Dubois drowned while attempting to cross to the mainland, while the remaining survivors endured thirty days in the wilderness until they were finally rescued by Captain Camille Coquilhat.

=== Establishment of Stanleyville and Kisangani ===
On 3 September 1886, Administrator General Camille Janssen issued a decree establishing nine districts within the colony, including Stanley Falls District, each governed by a district commissioner. In 1887, Stanley proposed Tippu Tip as the governor (&quot;wali&quot;) of the Stanley Falls District, a proposal accepted by both Leopold II and Barghash bin Said. Tippu Tip assumed the position on 24 February 1887, and Stanley Falls District remained under Arab control until June 1888. However, hostilities resumed, and Arab Swahili influence in Stanley Falls District was not decisively eliminated until 1893. On 15 July 1898, the Governor General decreed that the Stanley Falls District would henceforth be called the Eastern Province (&quot;Province Orientale&quot;), with Stanleyville designated as its capital. The city evolved into a significant terminus for steamer navigation on the Congo River, transforming from a modest trading post into a burgeoning urban center and serving as the headquarters for the entire eastern Congo Free State, including Katanga and Kivu, for several years until 1933. However, Stanleyville remained an underdeveloped administrative hub surrounded by native Congolese villages. As noted by Bogumil Jewsiewicki&#x27;s &quot;According to the testimony of the age&quot;,&quot;The villages of the Arabs, Kisangani-Singitini, as well as those of the Wagenya and the Lokeles around the Falls appear prosperous. Yet, they remain strangers to the town and are not part of its monetary economy. Their trade with the town is limited to the exchange of foodstuffs against indigo obtained from soldiers. The Wagenya especially exchange fish for cloth brought by the administration or its workers&quot;.The establishment of the CFL (&quot;Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Congo Supérieur aux Grands Lacs Africains&quot;) in 1902, with the mandate of constructing a rail/river linkage between Stanleyville and Katanga, accelerated development with the labor force ranging from 1,200 to 4,100 men. The construction of the Stanleyville-Ponthierville (now Ubundu) railway, initiated in February 1903 and concluded in September 1909, spurred substantial urban expansion with lined and overhung trees, buildings surrounded by trees in bloom, well-constructed residential and commercial buildings. Stanleyville&#x27;s economic significance largely stemmed from its location in a marshy tropical rainforest, which endows it with abundant natural resources. Its strategic position at a key freight breakpoint on the river also makes Stanleyville a vital hub for communications and goods transshipment operations. During the Belgian Congo colonial period, Stanleyville&#x27;s urban structure comprised a commercial center and residential districts for Europeans (Belgians, Portuguese) and Asians, separated from the all-black &quot;indigenous camps&quot; by green strips, schools, military barracks or playgrounds. 

The city&#x27;s official status was formalized by incorporation Order No. 12/357 on 6 September 1958, dividing Stanleyville into four communes: Belgian I, Belgian II, Brussels, and Stanley. Towards the end of 1958, the city became the stronghold of Patrice Lumumba, the leader of the political party Mouvement National Congolais (MNC). His strong ties with the city had been forged during his days as one of 350 clerks at the central post office. Ethiopian ONUC troops arrived in the city after July 1960. After the assassination of Lumumba in 1961, Antoine Gizenga installed the Free Republic of the Congo in Stanleyville, which competed with the central government in Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). Before the country gained independence from Belgium in 1960, Kisangani was reputed to have more Rolls-Royces per capita than any other city in the world.

In early 1964, the Simba Rebellion (&quot;Simba Revolution&quot;) occurred, mushrooming into outright rebellion by May and June. By August rebels had overrun Stanleyville from their bases in Wanie Rukula. They closed the airport and barred civilians from leaving, including at least one foreign consular staff. A number of American and European nationals were taken captive, and, following intense negotiations, Operation Dragon Rouge was launched by Belgium, the Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC), and a plethora of foreign mercenaries under Colonel Mike Hoare to free the hostages.

Following Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s ascension to power, on 3 May 1966, Stanleyville was renamed Kisangani as part of his &quot;authenticité&quot; policies, decreeing it the headquarters of the third economic center of Zaire, after Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. Between 1966 and 1967, Kisangani was the site of the Stanleyville mutinies, which resulted in widespread looting. As Mobutu&#x27;s &quot;authenticité&quot;-driven state ideology persisted throughout the 1970s, Stanley Falls was officially renamed Boyoma Falls. On 27 October 1977, the communes were renamed as follows: Belgian I (Mangobo and Tshopo), Belgian II (Lubunga), Brussels (Kabondo), and Stanley (Makiso). By 1984, the city had a population of 317,581.

In 2010, as part of the territorial division aimed at implementing the decentralization policy, the constitution proposed the subdivision of the territory into 26 provinces, as stipulated in Article 2 of the 2006 Constitution. Programming Law No. 15/004, which determined the modalities for the installation of these new provinces, was adopted on 28 February 2015, followed by the Organic Law establishing the boundaries of the provinces on 25 March 2015. Consequently, Orientale Province was dissolved, and Kisangani became the capital of the newly established Tshopo Province.

===Regional conflicts===
In the 1990s, the area emerged as the theatre for a series of major battles known as the fight of Kisangani during the First Congo War. Laurent-Désiré Kabila, leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, invaded the Congo from the eastern region of the country with assistance from Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda military forces. As of 30 October 1998, there were 15,000 Ugandan and 19,000 Rwandan troops on Congolese soil. Laurent Kabila designated Kisangani as the forward base for the foreign forces as he marched westwards towards Kinshasa to overthrow Mobutu Sese Seko.

The alliance of foreign military forces disintegrated when people of Hutu descent were massacred by the thousands in western Zaire and because of looting in the mining areas, in particular in Kisangani and the Kivus. The population was completely opposed to the presence of foreign forces because of their behaviour. Laurent-Désiré Kabila could not continue to support the use of Kisangani as the base for foreign fighters as they launched attacks to massacre the Hutu people – hence he demanded that Rwanda pull its forces out of the country.

In 1999, the city was the site of the first open fighting between Ugandan and Rwandan forces in the Second Congo War, when nearly 3,000 people died in the cross fire. This followed the fracturing of the anti-government rebel group Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) into camps based in Kisangani and Goma. The fighting was also over the gold mines near the town. The local population was caught in the cross fire between Ugandan and Rwandan military forces, which led to the destruction of about a quarter of the city. Various buildings were damaged, most notably the roof of the Cathedral Rosaire of Notre-Dame, which was ignited by missiles. Both of the foreign forces were reported to have looted and pillaged the city. Despite the condemnation of Uganda by the International Court of Justice, establishment of responsibility, payment of compensation, and arrests have yet to be made.
Further clashes between Rwandan and Ugandan forces led to thousands more deaths and widespread destruction from 5 to 10 June 2000.

During the Second Congo War, on 14 May 2002, 160 people were massacred in Kisangani; this is believed to be the work of those under the command of Laurent Nkunda. By the time a peace agreement was signed in 2002, the town was under the control of the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy - Goma (RCD-Goma).

The three encounters between Uganda and Rwanda in Kisangani have been termed the wars of 1 day, 3 days and, the deadliest fought in 2000, 6 days.

==Geography==

=== Location ===

Kisangani is strategically placed at the junction of the Congo,
Tshopo, and Lindi rivers and at the crossroads between eastern and western Congo. Approximately central of the African continent, it is located in north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), central of Tshopo Province. The location at the northernmost tip of the Congo River, navigable for large waterborne cargo between Kinshasa and Kisangani and connected to a natural transportation waterway for much of the Congo Basin, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading city.

The city is bordered by Banalia Territory to the north, Ubundu and Opala territories to the south, Isangi to the west, and Bafwasende municipalities to the east. Kisangani lies 324 km from Buta, from Isiro, from Bunia and from Kinshasa. The city&#x27;s topography is diverse, with a population density of 229 residents per km2. It sits in the midst of the vast and isolated Congo Basin, the second largest tropical woodlands on the planet. It is located at 0° 31&#x27; north latitude (57 km from the equator), 25° 11&#x27; east longitude from the meridian of Greenwich and above sea level. The altitude fluctuates across different plateaus, with the Arabized plateau in the southeast and the medical plateau to the west ranging from 37 to 45 meters, and the Boyoma plateau in the northeast reaching up to 46 meters. The National Institute of Statistics (INS) reports that Kisangani covers a total area of approximately 1,910 square kilometers.

=== Vegetation and forest reserves ===
Kisangani&#x27;s vegetative landscape is emblematic of the central forest sector of the Guinean region, characterized by dense tropical forests that have experienced various degrees of anthropogenic degradation. The city is encircled by several significant forested reserves:

* Tshopo Falls Forest Reserve: Dominated by &quot;Terminalia superba&quot; plantations, Tshopo Falls Forest Reserve exhibits characteristics of a young secondary forest, although older sections exist in some areas. The reserve is home to 508 species of vascular plants, with families like Rubiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae, Apocynaceae, Caesalpiniaceae, Moraceae, Commelinaceae, Marantaceae and Sterculiaceae being most represented. Notable arboreal species include the introduced &quot;Millettia laurentii&quot;, alongside &quot;Musanga cercropioides&quot;, &quot;Myrianthus arboreus&quot;, &quot;Zanthoxylum fagara&quot;, &quot;Klainodoxa gabonensis&quot;, and &quot;Pycnanthus angolensis&quot;.

Kisangani Arboretum: Covering 60 hectares, this artificial forest represents a state of secondary forest with 43 cultivated tree species from 21 botanical families, including Caesalpiniaceae, Meliaceae, and Sapotaceae. The arboretum contains spontaneous trees from the pre-existing forest, such as &quot;Autranella congolensis&quot;, &quot;Donella pruniformis&quot;, &quot;Omphalocarpa procera&quot;, &quot;Gilbertiodendron dewevrei&quot;, &quot;Strombosiopsis tetrandra&quot;, &quot;Cynometra alexandrii&quot;, &quot;Entandrophragma angolense&quot;, &quot;Guarea cedrata&quot;, and &quot;Pericopsis elata&quot;.
* Masako Forest Reserve: Spanning approximately 2,105 hectares, Masako consists of both secondary and primary forests. The secondary forests house 504 species of vascular plants, with Rubiaceae, Apocynaceae, Annonaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Menispermaceae, Connaraceae, Hippocrateaceae, Icacinaceae, and Sterculiaceae as dominant families. The primary forest is chiefly characterized by &quot;Gilbertiodendron dewevrei&quot; and hosts 268 species of vascular plants. The reserve is also notable for its preservation of three large relict trees, including an &quot;Entandrophragma&quot; species with a circumference of 764 cm.
* Kungulu Island Forest: This 100-hectare forest includes both secondary and primary forests, with species such as &quot;Piptadeniastrum africanum&quot; and &quot;Celtis mildbraedii&quot; predominating in the primary forest. The secondary forest comprises 254 species of vascular plants, with &quot;Musanga cecropioides&quot; as a dominant species in the younger forests.
* Yalisombo Forest: Covering approximately 170 square kilometers, Yalisombo is dominated by &quot;Gilbertiodendron dewevrei&quot; and hosts 424 species of Rhizophytes. The Rubiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Sterculiaceae, Apocynaceae, Annonaceae, Menispermaceae, Moraceae, Meliaceae, Acanthaceae, Fabaceae, and Sapotaceae families are well-represented, with species such as &quot;Brachystegia laurentii&quot;, &quot;Polyalthia suaveolens&quot;, &quot;Diospyros canaliculata&quot;, &quot;Staudtia gabonensis&quot;, &quot;Strombosia grandifolia&quot;, &quot;Streptomyces glaucescens&quot;, &quot;Garcinia polyantha&quot;, &quot;Gentiana punctata&quot;, &quot;Isolona bruneelii&quot;, &quot;Cola griseiflora&quot;, &quot;Pachystela bequaertii&quot;, &quot;Julbernardia seretii&quot;, and &quot;Manodora myristica&quot; accompanying the dominant species.

=== Floral Islands ===
Kisangani is encircled by several significant forest islands, which are more or less on the outskirts and positioned relatively distant from the city center. Notable among these floral islets are Mbie Island, characterized by patches of degraded primary forests and secondary forests dominated by &quot;Gilbertiodendron dewevrei&quot; and &quot;Scorodophloeus zenkeri&quot;. The Kilometer 25 Rail Forest Reserve, sprawling over 3,370 hectares, has been reforested with diverse tree species, including &quot;Terminalia superba&quot;, &quot;Pericopsis elata&quot;, &quot;Entandrophragma cylindricum&quot;, and &quot;Khaya anthotheca&quot;. The Kilometer 32 Rail Forest Reserve, covering 3,605 hectares, also features reforestation efforts with species such as &quot;Khaya spp&quot;., &quot;Entandrophragma cylindricum&quot;, and &quot;Terminalia superba&quot;, with 95 hectares specifically designated for reforestation. The Babagulu Forest Reserve, spanning an area of 2,360 hectares along the Kisangani-Ituri road, primarily consists of &quot;Gilbertiodendron dewevrei&quot;. 

L&#x27;Île Mbiye is located on the Congo River in the eastern part of Kisangani, upstream of the Wagenia Falls, with an altitude of . Adjacent to Kisangani, it is 14 km long and 4 km wide. Featuring a dense and relatively well-preserved forest, it is part of the Sustainable Forest Management in Africa Symposium project conducted by Stellenbosch University. The island, with an area of 1,400 hectares, comprises three types of forest: dry land forest, periodically flooded forest, and swampy forest.

=== Hydrology and geology ===

The Lualaba River flows through a bend to a confluence with the Congo River; at the alteration of the waterways lies the city of Kisangani. Much of Kisangani City is built on land with the Tshopo River on its north and the Congo River on its south. Many tributaries and islands are intertwined, conducive to moving inland waterways. Tidal straits separate L&#x27;Île Mbiye from the mainland of Kisangani City. The seven cataracts have a total drop of 61 meters (200 feet). Wagenia Falls where the fishery is installed on the rapids can be seen.

The soil in Kisangani is typical of the central Congo Basin, characterized by red ochre ferralitic soils, also known as Ferralsols or Oxisols. These soils are known for their considerable thickness, red to yellow coloring, and acidic pH (less than 6). The low silica sesquioxide ratio of the clay fraction, coupled with a low cation exchange capacity and primary mineral content, results in a soil with low clay activity and soluble element content, yet exhibiting fairly good stability of aggregates.

===Climate===
Despite being adjacent to the equator, the city has a tropical monsoon climate due to the fact that its driest month (January) sees on average below 60 mm of rain. Kisangani experiences an average relative humidity of 86%.

Typical climate in regions through which the Congo River flows is that of Kisangani, a town situated on the river&#x27;s right and left bank slightly north of the Equator. Humidity is high throughout the year, and annual rainfall amounts to and occurs fairly regularly; even in the driest month, the rainfall totals more than . Temperatures are also uniformly high throughout the year, and there is little diurnal variability. The average temperature at Kisangani is in the mid-20s°C (mid-70s°F). Kisangani is also a beneficiary of a cool breeze that often blows off the Congo River.

===Architecture===
Modern, multi-storey buildings of brick emerge from the dense walls of the vast Congo Basin jungle. Multiple kinds and scales of houses, townhouses, condominia, and apartment buildings can be found in Kisangani. The building form most closely associated with Kisangani is of Belgium influence, whose introduction and widespread adoption in colonial times saw Kisangani&#x27;s buildings shift from the thatch African tradition to the low-scale and vertical rise of European business districts.

Kisangani has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles still in their original form. These include the Aumonerie which is distinctive for its facade using visible stone-tone to evoke the building&#x27;s structure, the impressive 20th century headquarters landmark that is Central Prisons&#x27; with its towering fortress walls, Cathédrale Notre-Dame du Rosaire, an early cathedral revival built with massively scaled stone detailing, and the Congo Palace Hotel on avenue de l&#x27;eglise is an important example of highly influential European style buildings in Kisangani.

The character of Kisangani&#x27;s urban residential districts is often defined by the elegant villas with tiled roofs of old Belgian influence, brownstone rowhouses, townhouses, and tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1908 to 1950. Large swaths of Kisangani&#x27;s rural residential areas away from the city centre are characterized by continual strings of villages unfolding, each composed of thatched roof tops built from the early 20th century through to the present day. At times the path is filled with a sweet floral fragrance and clouded with white and purple butterflies. Forests give way to patches of grassland, then clumps of bamboo and then more forest.

===Communes===

The city of Kisangani is composed of six large communes, which are further subdivided into smaller neighborhoods. The partitioned communes are Lubunga, Makiso, Kisangani, Tshopo, Kabondo and Mangobo. Throughout the boroughs there are hundreds of distinct neighborhoods, many with a definable history and character to call their own. Every municipality in the city has a nickname denoting how the Boyoma perceive their cities. Kisangani, which in Swahili means on the island (&quot;&quot;Kisanga&quot; translates island and &quot;ni&quot;&quot; is on), is officially given the nickname of &quot;City of Hope&quot; by administrative authorities, in opposition to the title of martyred city. Boyomas&#x27; affectionately nicknamed their city &quot;Boyoma Singa Mwambé&quot;, which translates as &quot;before reaching the most beautiful city the pole must be thrown 8 times&quot; (Boyoma means the most beautiful girl, while Singa is the mast and Mwambé is the number 8).
*Kisangani commune is commonly referred to as &quot;Tolimo&quot; in Kigenyi, mainly due to the craft of scaffolds installed on Wagenia Falls.
*Mangobo is the city&#x27;s most populous commune and is known as &quot;Mathématique&quot; because of the difficulty in locating particular street address names that are simply manuscript numbered rather than word labelled.

*Kabondo is the commune that usually takes lead in annually hosting some of the city&#x27;s largest parades and public events mainly due to its cultural and social and ethnic diversity, an independent art scene, distinct neighborhoods and unique architectural heritage. As a result, Kabondo is known as &quot;Pilote&quot;.

==Economy==
Kisangani&#x27;s economy is the one largest of cities in the Congo Basin and is the largest in the former Orientale province. It&#x27;s an intricate hub of business and commerce and is one of three &quot;command centers&quot; for the Congolese economy (along with Kinshasa and Lubumbashi). Before the country gained independence from Belgium in 1960, Kisangani was reputed to have more Rolls-Royces per capita than any other city in the world. It flourished because of the many Boyoman who prospered during a boom in coffee, cotton and rubber production late in the colonial era, when those commodities still fetched high prices. Strategically positioned and central on a geographical map of the continent of Africa, at the confluence of the Lualaba River and Congo River, Kisangani is the inception and terminus point of river traffic between east and west of DR Congo, playing a major economic role in the &#x27;5 Chantiers&#x27; economic recovery and redevelopment of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The city is today an important centre of commerce, finance, industry, metallurgy, panning, real estate, hydro industries, agriculture, breweries, technology, culture, media, and arts.

One of Africa&#x27;s great trading centres; Kisangani&#x27;s strengths in its transportation system have contributed to the development of the city. SOTEXKI, the Textile Society of Kisangani produces fabrics and manufactures clothing, while Bralima produces beverages, REGIDESO treats and supplies water to the population, SORGERIE (Société de Gestion, de Gérance et d&#x27;Investissement), produces soaps, vegetable oils and other cosmetic products. Compagnie Forestière de Transformation (CFT) is the firm that process and exports African teak. Pharmaceuticals, printed material, food processing, telecommunications, textile and clothing manufacturing, tobacco and transportation, also play major roles in the city&#x27;s economy. The service sector is strong and includes civil, mechanical and process engineering, finance, higher education, and also research and development.

The forest island of Mbiye is one of the natural ecosystems in Kisangani that play a leading economic role with regard to the supply of food, medicines and building material, in which is of critical importance to the survival of plant life, wildlife and human populations.

Realising the importance of the biosphere and preservation of the forests biodiversity: &quot;Forty million Congolese depend in one way or another for their survival on the Congo forest&quot; says Stephan Van Praet of Greenpeace, who coordinated the research for the report, entitled Carving up the Congo. &quot;I can assure you they know the value of their forests. If you cut the sapele trees you take away the caterpillars they rely on as a source of protein.&quot;

L&#x27;Île Mbiye in Kisangani is part of the Sustainable Forest Management in Africa Symposium project of forest ecosystem conservation conducted by Stellenbosch University. Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is also looking to expand the area of forest under protection, for which it hopes to secure compensation through emerging markets for forest carbon.

The Port of Piroguiers is the largest inland port in the DRC, after the nation&#x27;s capital Kinshasa, handling million tonnes of cargo annually. As one of the most important ports in DRC, it remains a trans-shipment point link Kinshasa to the North-Eastern provinces for grain, sugar, petroleum products, machinery, and consumer goods. For this reason, Kisangani is a railway hub of DRC and has always been an extremely important rail city; it is home to the headquarters of Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo. Since the resumption of road traffic between Kisangani and its eastern cities, the markets of the city are regularly supplied and export food from and to Beni, Bunia and Butembo.

The city&#x27;s television and film industry is among the largest in the country. Creative industries such as new media, advertising, fashion, design and architecture account for a growing share of employment, with Kisangani City possessing a strong competitive advantage in these industries. Other important sectors include medical research and technology, non-profit institutions, and universities.

Kisangani&#x27;s informal sector is highly developed. Its composed of handicrafts, local brick manufactures, merchants close to the banks of the river that sell a variety of edible products (like prawns, kosa kosa and caterpillars), others engage in artisanal quarrying, ceramics, coffee growing, Jeweller dealing, producing cultural artifacts, precious metals goldsmithing or subsistence farming.

Manufacturing accounts for a large share of employment. Garments, chemicals, metal products, processed foods, and furniture are some of the principal products. Most of the food products derived from rural areas whose main activities are agriculture and livestock include kosa kosa and prawns, which are exported to all major cities of the DRC. The Wagenia, whom mostly fish the rapids of the famous Wagenia Falls on the Congo River are known for the possession of excellent fishing skills. The food-processing industry is a stable major manufacturing sector in the city. Chocolate is Kisangani&#x27;s leading specialty-food export, with imports of cocoa from nearby Kabinda District.

During the holidays, the young people enjoy the school holidays by engaging in part-time jobs, learning earlier on how to earn money and gaining family budgetary skills, thus adding to the family income. The children are likely to open up small vending businesses, of which the services offered may include selling boiled eggs, cooking oil or operating shoeshine stores, to name a few. Many parents believe that part-time work helps children to become more independent as well as providing them (and sometimes their families) with some extra income.

==Demographics==
During its first century, Kisangani grew at a rate that ranked among the fastest growing in the Belgian Congo. Within the span of forty years, the city&#x27;s population grew from slightly under 15,018 to over 121,765 by 1958. By the close of the 20th century, Kisangani was the third largest city in Zaire, and the largest of the cities that existed in the former Orientale province. Within thirty-three years of Zairieanastion, the population had tripled to over 600,000, and reached its highest ever-recorded population of 672,739 for the 2003 census.

The population is ethnically diverse and is changing rapidly, especially in large cities such as Kisangani, so it is not always easy to get an exact picture of the ethnic origin of all the population from census statistics. The last census in 2003 counted almost 672 739 inhabitants in the city of Kisangani. Lubunga is the town&#x27;s most populous but least dense with 115 775 inhabitants while Mangobo with 98 434 inhabitants is the most dense.

Demography has evolved as follows since colonial times:

Kisangani is the most populous city of the Northern provinces in the DRC, with an estimated 2008 population of 1,200,000 (up from 406,249 thousand in 1993). This amounts to about more than half the population of the northern regional population lives in the province of Tshopo. Over the last decade the city&#x27;s population has been increasing.

===Historical populations===
In 1905, there were a total of eleven stations and stations of the state in the area of Stanley Falls and Stanleyville. The total number of state officials increased to 40.

In 1909, the European Stanleyville numbered 80 and the native population was estimated at 15,000 people within a radius of 5 kilometers.

At the time the sprawling population in 1918 required the District Commissioner to create a daily food market in Kisangani, near the Hospital Avenue, 1 kilometre from shore. Two more weekly markets were also created on the other side, one near the docks and another at CFL Mission St. Gabriel. The population in the 1920s increased to 4,000 Africans and 200 Europeans, with an average of 2000 inhabitants moving around downtown Stanleyville (in the chiefdom Arabized).

The population of Stanleyville, in the early 1950s stood at 40,000 and by the late 1950s the population reached 70,000.

===Ethnicities===

The population of Kisangani is exceptionally diverse. Throughout its history the city has been a major melting pot of entry for immigrants. Today, some of the city&#x27;s population has foreign ancestry and among Congolese cities, this proportion is exceeded only by Kinshasa and Lubumbashi. In Kisangani no single community or region of origin dominates.

Some of the many African ethnic groups in Kisangani are: Bamanga, Popoi, Boa, Lokele, Turumbu, Mbole, Kumu, Wagenia, Rega, Topoke, Lokele, Turumbu, Basoko, Lendu, Budu, Bangetu, Logo, Alur, Hema, Azande and Yira ethnic group also have a notable presence. Non-African ethnic groups include many Flemings of Belgian origin. There are also small groups of Greeks, Chinese, Walloons, Indians and, lately, Lebanese.

The city has a heterogeneous population of over 250 ethnic African majorities of which Wagenia and Kumu compose the native population:

*In the north of the city of the Tshopo Commune, reside the Bamanga, Popoi, Boa that emigrated all the way from Buta.
* To the south of the city live the population groups of the Lokele, Turumbu, Mbole, Kumu, Wagenia and Rega, in the Lubunga Commune. Some arrived from the province of Maniema by the way of Ubundu road and rail, as well as the Opala road and the river toward the neighbouring territory of Isangi.
*Towards the west in the Commune of Mangobo, lie the Topoke, Lokele, Turumbu and Basoko, whom emigrated through the Congo River and Tshopo River, which divides the city into two banks of Tshopo.
*To the east of the city in the commune of Kabondo, is home to the Lendu, Budu, Bangetu, Logo, Alur, Hema, Nande, Yira, whom arrived Kisangani the Ituri road in Bunia.

==Government==

During independence of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the city was the political central base of the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC). Patrice Lumumba&#x27;s strong ties with the city had been forged during his days as one of 350 clerks at the central post office. Kisangani is now home to influential political youth groups such as Bana Etats-Unis and Vendome.

Since its devolution in 2006, Kisangani has been the Capital of Tshopo with a &quot;strong&quot; mayor-council form of government. Decentralization of central government power was enabled to give provincial governments more control of matters that directly affect them. The government of Kisangani is more centralized than that of most other DRC cities. As a constitutional democracy, Kisangani is governed by a wide range of institutions: the judiciary, the police, the civil service and the institutions of local government. In Kisangani, the central government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply and welfare services.

The People&#x27;s Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) holds the majority of public offices. As of November 2006, most of registered voters in the city are PPRD. Kisangani is the capital of the Tshopo Province. Kisangani was given the official nickname &quot;City of Hope&quot; by its government. Kisangani, a city home to some 1,200,000 civilians, is administratively divided into six urban communes: Makiso, Tshopo, Mangobo, Kabondo, Kisangani, and Lubunga and the communities of Lubuya and Bera are also parts of Kisangani City. Each commune is home to dozens of smaller neighborhoods (known in French as quartiers).

The head of the city government in Kisangani is the mayor, who is first among equals in the city council. The mayor in the period of 2008–2009 was Guy Shilton Baendo. The city council is a democratically elected institution and is the final decision-making authority in the city, although much power is centralized in the executive committee. The council has jurisdiction over many matters, including public security, agreements with other governments, subsidy programs, the environment, urban planning, and a three-year capital expenditure program. The city council is also required to supervise, standardize or approve certain decisions made by the commune councils.

Reporting directly to the City Council, the executive committee exercises decision-making powers similar to that of the cabinet in a parliamentary system and is responsible for preparing various documents including budgets and by-laws, submitted to the City Council for approval. The decision-making powers of the executive committee cover, in particular, the awarding of contracts or grants, the management of human and financial resources, supplies and buildings. It may also be assigned further powers by the City Council.

===Administration history===
During much of the last half of the 20th century, Kisangani&#x27;s politics were dominated by a growing Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) organization dominated by the charismatic Patrice Lumumba. During 1964 Kisangani was under siege of the Simbas, a group of powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, anarchist and labor organizations.

Indeed, a decree of Governor General dated 6 September 1958 and entered into force on 1 January 1959 established the city of Stanleyville. The city was divided into communes; each headed by a Mayor, the chief head of all of Stanleyville City was the city&#x27;s first Mayor.

The first consultation was held in commune of Stanleyville on Sunday, 14 December 1958. By Order No. 12/35 of 6 September 1958, the territory of Stanleyville took the status of a city. Stanleyville was divided into 4 municipalities: Belgian I, Belgian II, Brussels and Stanley.

Stanleyville&#x27;s City Council assisted each mayor in running the whole city, whilst each of the municipalities was assisted by Municipal Councils. The mayors of municipalities and municipal council members were elected. The city council included members of law, the mayors of municipalities, members appointed has company representatives, middle class representative and members representing the municipal councils.

===Laws===
Kisangani and its administrative representatives formed a prominent group responsible for drafting of the Congolese Forestry Code. The new forestry code according to section 89 requires logging companies, to draw up social responsibility contracts with their concessions, which may include building schools, housing and clinics while they carry out logging operations. Essentially the law demands firms to set up company towns. Greenpeace has however attacked this corporate-centered model, because it undermines the state&#x27;s responsibility to create a functioning system of social services.

The law states that the schooling age is from 5 to 19 years old, which comprises 39% of Kisangani&#x27;s population. The working age begins at 20 years and retirement age is set at 69 years old of which is 41.42% of the city&#x27;s demography.

==Education==
Since the 1950s, Kisangani has been a Congolese center of higher education and research with several universities that are in the city proper or in the immediate environs. Kisangani has the third largest campus of the National University of Congo. Much of the scientific research in the city is done in medicine and the life sciences. The Medicine Faculty at the Université de Kisangani was made infamous by Polio Vaccine conspiracy theorists.

In 2007, there were 381 academic and research staff, most of them (215) active in the humanities and social sciences – but the recent history of the institution overshadows its current realities.

Currently, the university&#x27;s income is derived from student fees (49 percent) and government subsidies (51 percent), but university management reports that the current income level is insufficient for effective operation. In addition, there is a serious need for infrastructure rehabilitation and additions, as well as for the acquisition of research literature. Although the university does not have a strategic plan to develop additional income sources, it is taking steps to increase academic fees to improve the daily operation of the institution.

The main challenges facing the university include serious weaknesses in the university&#x27;s information and communication technology (ICT) capabilities; and then the lack of qualified staff, of financial means, of premises and equipment, and of literature and laboratories. Clearly, the university&#x27;s physical infrastructure has not been rebuilt since the troubles. This is one reason why only 20% of the institutional focus of the Université de Kisangani is reckoned for research.

Kisangani is the seat of the Université de Kisangani (1963), Université Mariste du Congo, Institut Superieur du Commerce (ISC), Institut Superieur Pedagogique and Institut de Batiment et de Travaux Publiques, and the Kisangani Hellenic Center. The Kisangani Public Library, which has the largest collection of any public library system in the Kisangani, serves Makiso, Tshopo, Mangobo, Kabondo, Kisangani, Lubunga, Lubuya and Bera. The city&#x27;s public school system is managed by the Kisangani Department of Education. The primary and secondary schools are public and privately run by secular and religious groups in the city.

Kisangani grew in importance as a trading port while under Belgian rule. After the upper Congo Basin wars of Euro-Arab in the 1880s the city became the Belgian military and political base of operations in Northern Congo. In the mid-20th century, the city was transformed by immigration and development. A visionary development proposal expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Boyoma, and the 1819 opening of a railroad built to bypass the cataracts on the Congo River, opened shipping routes further into the Congo jungle. Kisangani became the most populous urbanized area and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Northern Congo.

===Transport===
The transportation system in Kisangani is extensive and complex. It includes the longest suspension bridge in Northern Congo. Public local transport is served by a network of buses, commuter trains and waterways that extend across and off the island.

Unlike many major cities, Kisangani does not have a problem with vehicular traffic congestion. Kisangani&#x27;s high rate of public transit use, daily Toleka users and many pedestrian commuters makes it the most energy-efficient major city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Walk and tolek modes of travel account for high percentage of all modes for trips in the city. The Tolek is a cycling taxi (&quot;Toleka&quot; means &quot;Time&quot; in Lingala), that emerged as the primary means of transportation around Kisangani during the mid-1990s.

As the city lies between stretches of the Tshopo and Congo Rivers, many tributaries and islands are intertwined conducive to moving inland waterways for the population of Kisangani and the transportation of goods by ships, boats or canoe (paddle or motorized), from one bank to another and from one neighborhood to another is made possible. Waterway systems connect Kisangani to various locales within and outside the city (including Isangi and Lomami). Kisangani is the highest navigable point on the River Congo and the terminus of river traffic from Kinshasa and all ports operated by ONATRA.

A considerable amount of automobile taxis and buses are also employed to supporting public transit throughout the city. The building of new gas stations and rehabilitation efforts for redevelopment of urban roads and the opening of the No. 4 National Highway Road are among the main factors behind this resumption of automobiles. The redevelopment of the National Highway Road No.4 has meant an increase in scrambling shuttles of traffic between Kisangani, Bafwasende, Komanda, Nurse, Mambasa, Beni and Butembo. Kisangani provides connections to Ubundu and Opala, along the southern corridors of Ubundu and Opala road respectively as well as long-distance road networks to cities such as Lubutu, Walikale, Goma and Kigali (in Rwanda) by way of the National Highway Road No. 2. Kisangani is part of the Trans-African Highway network 8 (TAH 8), at a length of 6259 km, the Trans-African Highway between Lagos (Nigeria) – Mombasa (Kenya) is longest transcontinental route between east–west of Africa. Kisangani also has access to the Indian Ocean coast by way of a highway corridor connecting the city to Dar es Salaam (Tanzania).

Shipping beyond Kisangani is impossible due to the Boyoma Falls; a portage railway was therefore built to Ubundu. It is operated by Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo, starting from Kisangani Station. This is considered the first section of the Great Lakes line.

Kisangani is served by Kisangani Bangoka International Airport on the far east side and the older Simi-Simi Airport on the west side. Bangoka is for commercial passenger flights and cargo only, whereas Simi-Simi mainly serves military purposes, though it also hosts some private and humanitarian flights.

=== Future and proposed projects ===

==== Rail ====
In October 2007, a railway was proposed to connect Kisangani to Kasese in western Uganda. This railway would extend as gauge to the Kenyan port of Lamu.

==== Road ====
The transcontinental road projects in Africa, Trans-African Highway network encompass Kisangani through the Lagos-Mombasa Highway.

Following the mandate of &quot;5 Chantiers&quot; the city of Kisangani road network undergoing redevelopment to make the city more integrated with towns and cities of other provinces, especially the eastern regions that previously made up the former Orientale Province. Boulevards in and around downtown Kisangani are part of the project.

<doc id="588212" wikidata="Q3511399" url="?curid=588212" title="Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings">
<text>The Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, Op. 31, is a song cycle written in 1943 by Benjamin Britten for tenor, solo horn and a string orchestra. Composed during the Second World War at the request of the horn player Dennis Brain, it is a setting of a selection of six poems by English poets on the subject of night, including both its calm and its sinister aspects. The poets Britten chose to set for the Serenade range from an anonymous 15th-century writer to poets from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.

Britten&#x27;s domestic partner – the tenor Peter Pears – and Brain were the soloists at the first performance. They later recorded the work, which has received subsequent recordings by tenors, horn players, orchestras and conductors from Britain, continental Europe, America and Australia.

==Background and first performance==

Britten and his partner, Peter Pears, returned to Britain in April 1942 after three years in the United States. A few weeks later Britten was commissioned by the BBC to write incidental music for a documentary series on life in England to be broadcast to the US. The score was played by the RAF Orchestra, in which Dennis Brain was first horn. Britten was struck by Brain&#x27;s skill and needed little persuasion to write a concert piece for him.

Brain may have been expecting a concerto, but instead Britten chose to compose a song-cycle with the horn and the singer as equal partners. Early in 1943 he caught measles so severely that he was in hospital for several weeks, and then convalesced at his country house in Suffolk. There, while also working on his opera &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, he composed most of the Serenade. In April 1943 he wrote to a friend, &quot;I&#x27;ve practically completed a new work (6 Nocturnes) for Peter and a lovely young horn player Dennis Brain, &amp; Strings ... It is not important stuff, but quite pleasant, I think&quot;.

The Serenade contains Britten&#x27;s first settings of English poems since &quot;On This Island&quot; in 1937. In selecting them Britten had advice from Edward Sackville-West, to whom he dedicated the work. Sackville-West wrote of the Serenade:
Britten acknowledged the help Brain had given him with the horn part:
The first performance was given at the Wigmore Hall in London on 15 October 1943 with Pears and Brain as soloists, and Walter Goehr conducting his eponymous string orchestra. It was well received: &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the most remarkable, and on any estimation most successful, of modern English compositions. … Britten&#x27;s imagination seems to be most readily kindled by words, which strike an equivalent musical image out of him with the utmost spontaneity&quot;. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; thought it a &quot;very likeable and uncommon piece&quot;, but was inclined to Britten&#x27;s own view of the importance of the work, and thought the solo horn prologue and epilogue &quot;unnecessary&quot;. Britten was pleased by the reception of the piece: he wrote to an American friend, &quot;We had a lovely show, with wonderful enthusiasm and lovely notices&quot;.

==Content==
The settings are framed by a horn prologue and epilogue; Britten had employed a framing device in his 1942 &quot;A Ceremony of Carols&quot;, and did so again in the prologue and epilogue to &quot;Billy Budd&quot;. In the Serenade both prologue and epilogue are performed by the horn alone, and in these movements Britten instructs the player to use only the horn&#x27;s natural harmonics; this lends these short movements a distinctive character, as some harmonics sound sharp or flat to an audience accustomed to the western chromatic scale. The epilogue is to sound from afar, and to this end the final song does not include a part for the horn to allow the player to move off-stage.

===Movements===
The Serenade has eight movements:
#&quot;Prologue&quot; (horn solo)
#&quot;Pastoral&quot;, a setting of &quot;The Evening Quatrains&quot; by Charles Cotton (1630–1687)
#&quot;Nocturne&quot;, a setting of &quot;Blow, bugle, blow&quot; by Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892)
#&quot;Elegy&quot;, a setting of &quot;The Sick Rose&quot; by William Blake (1757–1827)
#&quot;Dirge&quot;, a setting of the anonymous &quot;Lyke-Wake Dirge&quot; (15th century)
#&quot;Hymn&quot;, a setting of &quot;Hymn to Diana&quot; by Ben Jonson (1572–1637)
#&quot;Sonnet&quot;, a setting of &quot;To Sleep&quot; by John Keats (1795–1821)
#&quot;Epilogue&quot; (horn solo; reprise of Prologue, played offstage)

===Lyrics===
The words or lyrics to each movement are:

====1. Prologue====
:(solo horn)

====2. Pastoral====
&lt;poem&gt;
 The day&#x27;s grown old; the fainting sun
 Has but a little way to run,
 And yet his steeds, with all his skill,
 Scarce lug the chariot down the hill.

 The shadows now so long do grow,
 That brambles like tall cedars show;
 Molehills seem mountains, and the ant
 Appears a monstrous elephant.

 A very little, little flock
 Shades thrice the ground that it would stock;
 Whilst the small stripling following them
 Appears a mighty Polypheme.

 And now on benches all are sat,
 In the cool air to sit and chat,
 Till Phoebus, dipping in the West,
 Shall lead the world the way to rest.
&lt;/poem&gt;
:::::Charles Cotton (1630–1687)

====3. Nocturne====
&lt;poem&gt;
 The splendour falls on castle walls
 And snowy summits old in story:
 The long light shakes across the lakes,
 And the wild cataract leaps in glory:

 Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
 Bugle blow; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

 O hark, O hear, how thin and clear,
 And thinner, clearer, farther going!
 O sweet and far from cliff and scar
 The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!

 Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:
 Bugle, blow; answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.

 O love, they die in yon rich sky,
 They faint on hill or field or river:
 Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
 And grow for ever and for ever.

 Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying;
 And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.
&lt;/poem&gt;
:::::Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892)

====4. Elegy====
&lt;poem&gt;
 O Rose, thou art sick;
 The invisible worm
 That flies in the night,
 In the howling storm,

 Has found out thy bed
 Of crimson joy;
 And his dark, secret love
 Does thy life destroy.
&lt;/poem&gt;
:::::William Blake (1757–1827)

====5. Dirge====
&lt;poem&gt;
 This ae nighte, this ae nighte,
 Every nighte and alle,
 Fire and fleet and candle‑lighte,
 And Christe receive thy saule.

 When thou from hence away art past,
 Every nighte and alle,
 To Whinnymuir thou com&#x27;st at last;
 And Christe receive thy saule.

 If ever thou gav&#x27;st hos&#x27;n and shoon,
 Every nighte and alle,
 Sit thee down and put them on;
 And Christe receive thy saule.

 If hos&#x27;n and shoon thou ne&#x27;er gav&#x27;st nane
 Every nighte and alle,
 The whinnes sall prick thee to the bare bane;
 And Christe receive thy saule.

 From Whinnymuir when thou may&#x27;st pass,
 Every nighte and alle,
 To Brig o&#x27; Dread thou com&#x27;st at last;
 And Christe receive thy saule.

 From Brig o&#x27; Dread when thou may&#x27;st pass,
 Every nighte and alle,
 To Purgatory fire thou com&#x27;st at last;
 And Christe receive thy saule.

 If ever thou gav&#x27;st meat or drink,
 Every nighte and alle,
 The fire sall never make thee shrink;
 And Christe receive thy saule.

 If meat or drink thou ne&#x27;er gav&#x27;st nane,
 Every nighte and alle,
 The fire will burn thee to the bare bane;
 And Christe receive thy saule.

 This ae nighte, this ae nighte,
 Every nighte and alle,
 Fire and fleet and candle‑lighte,
 And Christe receive thy saule.
&lt;/poem&gt;
:::::Lyke Wake Dirge, Anonymous (15th century)

====6. Hymn====
&lt;poem&gt;
 Queen and huntress, chaste and fair,
 Now the sun is laid to sleep,
 Seated in thy silver chair,
 State in wonted manner keep:
 Hesperus entreats thy light,
 Goddess excellently bright.

 Earth, let not thy envious shade
 Dare itself to interpose;
 Cynthia&#x27;s shining orb was made
 Heav&#x27;n to clear when day did close:
 Bless us then with wishèd sight,
 Goddess excellently bright.

 Lay thy bow of pearl apart,
 And thy crystal shining quiver;
 Give unto the flying hart
 Space to breathe, how short so-ever:
 Thou that mak&#x27;st a day of night,
 Goddess excellently bright.
&lt;/poem&gt;
:::::Ben Jonson (1572–1637)

====7. Sonnet====
&lt;poem&gt;
 O soft embalmer of the still midnight,
 Shutting with careful fingers and benign
 Our gloom‑pleas&#x27;d eyes, embower&#x27;d from the light,
 Enshaded in forgetfulness divine:

 O soothest Sleep! if so it please thee, close
 In midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes,
 Or wait the &quot;Amen&quot; ere thy poppy throws
 Around my bed its lulling charities.

 Then save me, or the passèd day will shine
 Upon my pillow, breeding many woes,
 Save me from curious Conscience, that still lords

 Its strength for darkness, burrowing like a mole;
 Turn the key deftly in the oilèd wards,
 And seal the hushèd Casket of my Soul.
&lt;/poem&gt;
:::::John Keats (1795–1821)

====8. Epilogue====
:(solo horn – off stage)

==Recordings==
In 2020 &quot;Gramophone&quot; published a survey of recordings of the Serenade. These are the recordings mentioned:

A 2022 recording featured Andrew Staples (tenor), Christopher Parkes (horn) and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Daniel Harding.

<text>Carl Jakob Sundevall (22 October 1801 in Högestad – 2 February 1875) was a Swedish zoologist.
Sundevall studied at Lund University, where he received a Ph.D. in 1823. After traveling to East Asia, he studied medicine, graduating as a Doctor of Medicine in 1830.

He was employed at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, from 1833, and was professor and keeper of the vertebrate section from 1839 to 1871. He wrote &quot;Svenska Foglarna&quot; (1856–87), which described 238 species of birds observed in Sweden. He classified a number of birds collected in southern Africa by Johan August Wahlberg. In 1835, he developed a phylogeny for the birds based on the muscles of the hip and leg that contributed to later work by Thomas Huxley. He then went on to examine the arrangement of the deep plantar tendons in the bird&#x27;s foot. This latter information is still used by avian taxonomists. Sundevall was also an entomologist and arachnologist, for which (for the latter field) in 1833 he published an early catalog &quot;Conspectus Arachnidum&quot;. Much later in 1862, he wrote a monograph proposing a universal phonetic alphabet, &quot;Om phonetiska bokstäver&quot;.

==Legacy==
Sundevall is commemorated in the scientific names of four species of reptiles: &quot;Elapsoidea sundevallii, Leptotyphlops sundewalli, Mochlus sundevallii&quot;, and &quot;Prosymna sundevalli&quot;. Also the rodent, Sundevall&#x27;s jird (&quot;Meriones crassus&quot;), is named after him.

<doc id="588215" wikidata="Q484458" url="?curid=588215" title="Buddhas of Bamiyan">
<text>The Buddhas of Bamiyan (, ) were two possibly 6th-century monumental Buddhist statues in the Bamiyan Valley of Afghanistan. Located to the northwest of Kabul, at an elevation of , carbon dating of the structural components of the Buddhas has determined that the smaller &quot;Eastern Buddha&quot; was built around 570 CE, and the larger &quot;Western Buddha&quot; was built around 618 CE, which would date both to the time when the Hephthalites ruled the region.

As a UNESCO World Heritage Site of historical Afghan Buddhism, it was a holy site for Buddhists on the Silk Road. However, in March 2001, both statues were destroyed by the Taliban following an order given on February 26, 2001, by Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar, to destroy all the statues in Afghanistan &quot;so that no one can worship or respect them in the future&quot;. International and local opinion condemned the destruction of the Buddhas.

The statues represented a later evolution of the classic blended style of Greco-Buddhist art at Gandhara. The larger statue was named &quot;Salsal&quot; (&quot;the light shines through the universe&quot;) and was referred as a male. The smaller statue is called &quot;Shah Mama&quot; (&quot;Queen Mother&quot;) and is considered as a female figure. But it is unsure. They have made the smaller statue first, then the larger one. Technically, both were reliefs: at the rear, they each merged into the cliff wall. The main bodies were hewn directly from the sandstone cliffs, but details were modeled in mud mixed with straw, coated with stucco. This coating, the majority of which wore away long ago, was painted to enhance the expressions of the faces, hands, and folds of the robes; the larger one was painted carmine red, and the smaller one was painted multiple colours. The lower parts of the statues&#x27; arms were constructed from the same mud-straw mix, supported on wooden armatures. It is believed that the upper parts of their faces consisted of huge wooden masks.

Since the 2nd century CE, Bamiyan had been a Buddhist religious site on the Silk Road under the Kushans, remaining so until the Islamic conquests of 770 CE, and finally coming under the Turkic Ghaznavid rule in 977 CE. In 1221, Genghis Khan during the Siege of Bamyan invaded the Bamiyan Valley, wiping out most of its population but leaving the Bamiyan Buddhas undamaged. Later in the 17th century, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb briefly ordered the use of artillery to destroy the statues, causing some damage, though the Buddhas survived without any major harm.

The Buddhas had been surrounded by numerous caves and surfaces decorated with paintings. It is thought that these mostly dated from the 6th to 8th centuries CE and had come to an end with the Muslim conquests of Afghanistan. The smaller works of art are considered as an artistic synthesis of Buddhist art and Gupta art from ancient India, with influences from the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire, as well as the Tokhara Yabghus.

==History==

=== Commissioning ===

Bamiyan lies on the Silk Road, which runs through the Hindu Kush mountain region in the Bamiyan Valley. The Silk Road has been historically a caravan route linking the markets of China with those of the Western world. It was the site of several Buddhist monasteries, and a thriving center for religion, philosophy, and art. Monks at the monasteries lived as hermits in small caves carved into the side of the Bamyan cliffs. Most of these monks embellished their caves with religious statuary and elaborate, brightly colored frescoes, sharing the culture of Gandhara.

The Great Buddhas of Bamiyan were built around 600 CE during the time of the Hephthalites, who ruled as principalities in the areas of Tokharistan and northern Afghanistan. The Hephthalites did not always follow the Buddhist faith. For instance, during the time of Song Yun, who visited the chief of the Hephthalite nomads at his summer residence in Badakhshan and later in Gandhara, said that they had no belief in the Buddhist law and served a large number of divinities.&quot; Bamiyan had been a Buddhist religious site since the 2nd century CE under the Kushans, and remained so up to the time of the Muslim conquest of the Abbasid Caliphate under Al-Mahdi in 770 CE. It became Buddhist again from 870 CE until the final Islamic conquest of 977 CE under the Turkic Ghaznavid dynasty. Murals in the adjoining caves have been carbon dated from 438 to 980 CE, suggesting that Buddhist artistic activity continued down to the final occupation by the Muslims.

The two most prominent statues were the giant standing sculptures of the Buddhas Vairocana and Sakyamuni (Gautama Buddha), identified by the different mudras performed. The Buddha popularly called &quot;Solsol&quot; measured 55 meters tall, and &quot;Shahmama&quot; 38 meters. The niches in which the figures stood are 58 and 38 meters respectively from bottom to top. Before being blown up in 2001, they were the largest examples of standing Buddha carvings in the world (the 8th century Leshan Giant Buddha is taller, but is sitting).
Following the destruction of the statues in 2001, carbon dating of organic internal structural components found in the rubble has determined that the two Buddhas were built , with narrow dates of between 544 and 595 CE for the 38-meter Eastern Buddha, and between 591 and 644 CE for the larger Western Buddha. Recent scholarship has also been giving broadly similar dates based on stylistic and historical analysis, although the similarities with the Art of Gandhara had generally encouraged an earlier dating in older literature.

Historic documentation refers to celebrations held every year attracting numerous pilgrims, with offers being made to the monumental statues. They were perhaps the most famous cultural landmarks of the region, and the site was listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site along with the surrounding cultural landscape and archaeological remains of the Bamyan Valley. Their colour faded through time.

=== Pre-modern era ===
Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang visited the site on 30 April 630, and described Bamyan in the &quot;Da Tang Xiyu Ji&quot; as a flourishing Buddhist center &quot;with more than ten monasteries and more than a thousand monks&quot;. He also noted that both Buddha figures were &quot;decorated with gold and fine jewels&quot; (Wriggins, 1995). Intriguingly, Xuanzang mentions a third, even larger, reclining statue of the Buddha. A monumental seated Buddha, similar in style to those at Bamyan, still exists in the Bingling Temple caves in China&#x27;s Gansu province.

==Mural paintings==
The Buddhas are surrounded by numerous caves and surfaces decorated with paintings. It is thought that the period of florescence was from the 6th to 8th century CE, until the onset of Islamic invasions. These works of art are considered as an artistic synthesis of Buddhist art and Gupta art from India, with influences from the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire, as well as the country of Tokharistan. The later paintings are attributable to the &quot;Turk period&quot; (7th–9th century CE).

=== Eastern Buddha (built ) ===
Most of the surfaces in the niche housing the Buddha must have been decorated with colourful murals, surrounding the Buddha with many paintings, but only fragments were remaining in modern times. For the 38 meter Eastern Buddha, built between 544 and 595 CE, the main remaining murals were the ones on the ceiling, right above the head of the Buddha. Recent dating based on stylistic and historical analysis confirms dates for these mural which follow the carbon-rated dates for the construction of the Buddhas themselves: the murals of the Eastern Buddha have been dated to the 6th to 8th century CE by Klimburg-Salter (1989), and post 635/645 CE by Tanabe (2004). As late as 2002, Marylin Martin Rhie argued a 3rd–4th century date for the Eastern Buddha, based on artistic criteria.

====Sun God====
Among the most famous paintings of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, the ceiling of the smaller Eastern Buddha represents a solar deity on a chariot pulled by horses, as well as ceremonial scenes with royal figures and devotees. The god is wearing a caftan in the style of Tokhara, boots, and is holding a lance. His representation is derived from the iconography of the Iranian god Mithra, as revered in Sogdia. He is riding a two-wheeled golden chariot, pulled by four horses. Two winged attendants are standing to the side of the charriot, wearing a Corinthian helmet with a feather, and holding a shield. In the top portion are wind gods, flying with a scarf held in both hands. This composition is unique, and distinct from Gandhara or India, but there are some similarities with the paintings of Kizil and Dunhuang.

The central image of the Sun God on his golden chariot is framed by two lateral rows of individuals: kings and dignitaries mingling with Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. One of the personages, standing behind a monk in profile, is likely the King of Bamyan. He wears a crenulated crown with single crescent and korymbos, a round-neck tunic and a Sasanian headband.

====Hephthalite donors====
The Bamiyan Buddhas were built at the time of the Hephthalites. Several of the figures have the characteristic appearance of the Hephthalites of Tokharistan, with belted jackets with a unique lapel of their tunic being folded on the right side, the cropped hair, the hair accessories, their distinctive physiognomy and their round beardless faces. These figures must represent the donors and potentates who supported the building of the monumental giant Buddha. The individuals in this painting are very similar to the individuals depicted in Balalyk Tepe, and they may be related to the Hepthalites. They participate &quot;to the artistic tradition of the Hephthalite ruling classes of Tukharestan&quot;.

These murals disappeared with the destructions of 2001.

=== Western Buddha (built ) ===
A few murals also remained around the taller 55 meter Western Buddha on the ceiling and on the sides. Many are more conventionally Buddhist in character. Some of the later mural paintings show male devotees in double-lapel caftans.

===Adjoining caves===
Later mural paintings of Bamiyan, dated to the 7th–8th centuries CE, display a variety of male devotees in double-lapel caftans. The works of art show a sophistication and cosmopolitanism comparable to other works of art of the Silk Road, such as those of Kizil, are attributable to the sponsorship of the Western Turks (Yabghus of Tokharistan). The nearby Kakrak caves also have some works of art.

After the destruction of the Buddhas, 50 more caves were revealed. In 12 of the caves, wall paintings were discovered. In December 2004, an international team of researchers stated that the wall paintings at Bamyan were painted between the 5th and the 9th centuries, rather than the 6th to 8th centuries, citing their analysis of radioactive isotopes contained in straw fibers found beneath the paintings. It is believed that the paintings were done by artists travelling on the Silk Road.
Scientists from the Tokyo Research Institute for Cultural Properties in Japan, the Centre of Research and Restoration of the French Museums in France, the Getty Conservation Institute in the United States, and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, analysed samples from the paintings, typically less than 1 mm across. They discovered that the paint contained pigments such as vermilion (red mercury sulfide) and lead white (lead carbonate). These were mixed with a range of binders, including natural resins, gums (possibly animal skin glue or egg), and oils, probably derived from walnuts or poppies. Specifically, researchers identified drying oils from murals showing Buddhas in vermilion robes sitting cross-legged amid palm leaves and mythical creatures as being painted in the middle of the 7th century. It is believed that they are the oldest known surviving examples of oil painting, possibly predating oil painting in Europe by as much as six centuries. The discovery may lead to a reassessment of works in ancient ruins in Iran, China, Pakistan, Turkey, and India.

Initial suspicion that the oils might be attributable to contamination from fingers, as the touching of the painting is encouraged in Buddhist tradition, was dispelled by spectroscopy and chromatography giving an unambiguous signal for the intentional use of drying oils rather than contaminants. Oils were discovered underneath layers of paint, unlike surface contaminants.

Scientists also found the translation of the beginning section of the original Sanskrit Pratītyasamutpāda Sutra translated by Xuanzang that spelled out the basic belief of Buddhism and said all things are transient.

==Attacks on the statues==

=== Taliban incursions (1998–2001) ===
During the Afghan Civil War, the area around the Buddhas was initially under the control of the Hezbe Wahdat—part of the Northern Alliance—who were against the Taliban. However, Mazar-i-Sharif fell in August 1998, and the Bamyan valley was entirely surrounded by Taliban. The town was captured on 13 September 1998 after a successful blockade.

Abdul Wahed, a local Taliban commander who had long before announced his intentions to obliterate the Buddhas, drilled holes in the Buddhas&#x27; heads into which he planned to load explosives. He was prevented from proceeding by Mohammed Omar, the de facto leader of the Taliban: According to United Nations representative Michael Semple: Other people blew off the head of the smaller Buddha using dynamite, aimed rockets at the larger Buddha&#x27;s groin, and burnt tires at the latter&#x27;s head. In July 1999, Omar decreed in favour of preserving the statues, and described plans to establish a tourism circuit. In early 2000, local Taliban authorities asked for the UN&#x27;s assistance to rebuild drainage ditches around the tops of the alcoves where the Buddhas were set.

=== Destruction by the Islamic Emirate ===

==== Decision to destroy ====
On 1 March 2001, the Taliban announced that all statues depicting humans in Afghanistan would be destroyed. Work to destroy the Buddhas began the next day, on 2 March, and continued for several weeks. Various theories have sought to explain what prompted Taliban leader Mullah Omar to order the destruction of the statues, further complicated by seemingly shifting narratives of the events as relayed by Omar and senior Taliban officials.

On 6 March 2001, British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; quoted Omar as stating &quot;Muslims should be proud of smashing idols. It has given praise to Allah that we have destroyed them.&quot;

During a 13 March interview for Japan&#x27;s &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot;, Afghan Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel stated that the destruction was anything but a retaliation against the international community for economic sanctions: &quot;We are destroying the statues in accordance with Islamic law and it is purely a religious issue.&quot; A statement issued by the ministry of religious affairs of the Taliban regime justified the destruction as being in accordance with Islamic law.

Later, on 18 March 2001, then Taliban ambassador-at-large Sayed Rahmatullah Hashemi said that the destruction of the statues was carried out by the Head Council of Scholars after a Swedish monuments expert proposed to restore the statues&#x27; heads. Rahmatullah Hashemi is reported as saying: &quot;When the Afghan head council asked them to provide the money to feed the children instead of fixing the statues, they refused and said, &#x27;No, the money is just for the statues, not for the children&#x27;. Herein, they made the decision to destroy the statues&quot;; however, he did not comment on the claim that a foreign museum offered to &quot;buy the Buddhist statues, the money from which could have been used to feed children&quot;. Rahmatullah Hashemi added: &quot;If we had wanted to destroy those statues, we could have done it three years ago,&quot; referring to the start of U.S. sanctions. &quot;In our religion, if anything is harmless, we just leave it. If money is going to statues while children are dying of malnutrition next door, then that makes it harmful, and we destroy it.&quot; Hashemi denied any religious grounds in the justification of the statues&#x27; destruction.

In 2004, following the American invasion of Afghanistan and his exile, Omar explained in an interview:

There is additional speculation that the destruction may have been influenced by al-Qaeda in order to further isolate the Taliban from the international community, thus tightening relations between the two; however, the evidence is circumstantial. Abdul Salam Zaeef held that the destruction of the Buddhas was finally ordered by Abdul Wali, the Minister for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.

==== International reaction ====
The Taliban&#x27;s intention to destroy the statues caused a wave of international horror and protest. According to UNESCO Director-General Kōichirō Matsuura, a meeting of ambassadors from the 54 member states of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) was conducted. All OIC states—including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, three countries that officially recognised the Taliban government—joined the protest to spare the monuments. Saudi Arabia and the UAE later condemned the destruction as &quot;savage&quot;. Although India never recognised the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, New Delhi offered to arrange for the transfer of all the artifacts in question to India, &quot;where they would be kept safely and preserved for all mankind&quot;. These overtures were rejected by the Taliban. Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf sent a delegation led by Pakistan&#x27;s interior minister Moinuddin Haider to Kabul to meet with Omar and try to prevent the destruction, arguing that it was un-Islamic and unprecedented. As recounted by Steve Coll:
According to Taliban minister, Abdul Salam Zaeef, UNESCO sent the Taliban government 36 letters objecting to the proposed destruction. He asserted that the Chinese, Japanese, and Sri Lankan delegates were the most strident advocates for preserving the Buddhas. The Japanese in particular proposed a variety of different solutions to the issue, including moving the statues to Japan, covering the statues from view, and the payment of money. The second edition of the Turkistan Islamic Party&#x27;s magazine &quot;Islamic Turkistan&quot; contained an article on Buddhism, and described the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan despite attempts by the Japanese government of &quot;infidels&quot; to preserve the remains of the statues. The exiled Dalai Lama said he was &quot;deeply concerned&quot;.

The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas despite protests from the international community has been described by Michael Falser, a heritage expert at the Center for Transcultural Studies in Germany, as an attack by the Taliban against the globalising concept of &quot;cultural heritage&quot;. The UNESCO Director-General Kōichirō Matsuura called the destruction a &quot;...crime against culture. It is abominable to witness the cold and calculated destruction of cultural properties which were the heritage of the Afghan people, and, indeed, of the whole of humanity.&quot; Ahmad Shah Massoud, leader of the anti-Taliban resistance force, also condemned the destruction.

In Rome, the former Afghan King, Mohammed Zahir Shah, denounced the declaration in a rare press statement, calling it &quot;against the national and historic interests of the Afghan people&quot;. Zemaryalai Tarzi, who was Afghanistan&#x27;s chief archeologist in the 1970s, called it an &quot;unacceptable decision&quot;.

==== Process of destruction ====
The destruction was carried out in stages. Initially, the statues were fired at for several days using anti-aircraft guns and artillery. This caused severe damage, but did not obliterate them. During the destruction, Taliban Information Minister Qudratullah Jamal said that, &quot;The destruction work is not as easy as people would think. You can&#x27;t knock down the statues by dynamite or shelling as both of them have been carved in a cliff. They are firmly attached to the mountain.&quot; Later, the Taliban placed anti-tank mines at the bottom of the niches, so that when fragments of rock broke off from artillery fire, the statues would receive additional destruction from particles that set off the mines. In the end, the Taliban lowered men down the cliff face and placed explosives into holes in the Buddhas. After one of the explosions failed to obliterate the face of one of the Buddhas, a rocket was launched that left a hole in the remains of the stone head.

A local civilian, speaking to Voice of America in 2002, said that he and some other locals were forced to help destroy the statues. He also claimed that Pakistani and Arab engineers were involved in the destruction. Mullah Omar, during the destruction, was quoted as saying, &quot;What are you complaining about? We are only waging war on stones&quot;.

===Current status (2002–present)===
Though the figures of the two large Buddhas have been destroyed, their outlines and some features are still recognisable within the recesses. It is also still possible for visitors to explore the monks&#x27; caves and passages that connect them. As part of the international effort to rebuild Afghanistan after the Taliban war, the Japanese government and several other organisations—among them the Afghanistan Institute in Bubendorf, Switzerland, along with the ETH Zurich—have committed to rebuilding, perhaps by anastylosis, the two larger Buddhas. The local residents of Bamyan have also expressed their favour in restoring the structures.

In April 2002, Afghanistan&#x27;s post-Taliban leader Hamid Karzai called the destruction a &quot;national tragedy&quot; and pledged the Buddhas to be rebuilt. He later called the reconstruction a &quot;cultural imperative&quot;.

In September 2005, Mawlawi Mohammed Islam Mohammadi, Taliban governor of Bamyan province at the time of the destruction and widely seen as responsible for its occurrence, was elected to the Afghan Parliament. He blamed the decision to destroy the Buddhas on Al-Qaeda&#x27;s influence on the Taliban. In January 2007, he was assassinated in Kabul.

Swiss filmmaker Christian Frei made a 95-minute documentary titled &quot;The Giant Buddhas&quot; on the statues, the international reactions to their destruction, and an overview of the controversy, released in March 2006. Testimony by local Afghans validates that Osama bin Laden ordered the destruction and that, initially, Mullah Omar and the Afghans in Bamyan opposed it.

Since 2002, international funding has supported recovery and stabilisation efforts at the site. Fragments of the statues are documented and stored with special attention given to securing the structure of the statue still in place. It is hoped that, in the future, partial anastylosis can be conducted with the remaining fragments. In 2009, ICOMOS constructed scaffolding within the niche to further conservation and stabilization. Nonetheless, several serious conservation and safety issues exist and the Buddhas are still listed as World Heritage in Danger.

In the summer of 2006, Afghan officials were deciding on the timetable for the re-construction of the statues. As they waited for the Afghan government and international community to decide when to rebuild them, a $1.3 million UNESCO-funded project was sorting out the chunks of clay and plaster—ranging from boulders weighing several tons to fragments the size of tennis balls—and sheltering them from the elements.

The Buddhist remnants at Bamyan were included on the 2008 World Monuments Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites by the World Monuments Fund.

In 2013, the foot section of the smaller Buddha was rebuilt with iron rods, bricks and concrete by the German branch of ICOMOS. Further constructions were halted by order of UNESCO, on the grounds that the work was conducted without the organisation&#x27;s knowledge or approval. The effort was contrary to UNESCO&#x27;s policy of using original material for reconstructions, and it has been pointed out that it was done based on assumptions.

In 2015, a wealthy Chinese couple, Janson Hu and Liyan Yu, financed the creation of a Statue of Liberty-size 3D light projection of an artist&#x27;s view of what the larger Buddha, known as Solsol to locals, might have looked like in its prime. The image was beamed into the niche one night in 2015; later the couple donated their $120,000 projector to the culture ministry.

Shortly after the 2021 Taliban offensive that saw the overthrow of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the return of Taliban to the government, tourists were again granted permission to visit the site. While the Taliban promised to preserve the Bamyan valley, preservation work was ceased indefinitely. UNESCO&#x27;s Afghan operations were stymied, largely due to foreign investors&#x27; fears that continued support of cultural preservation projects in the country would run afoul of international sanctions. In February 2023, UNESCO&#x27;s restoration work resumed when the Italian government approved new funding.

==Restoration==

The UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan cultural projects convened to discuss what to do about the two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in Paris. Researcher Erwin Emmerling of Technical University Munich announced he believed it would be possible to restore the smaller statue using an organic silicon compound. The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamyan site. These included leaving the larger Western niche empty as a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums. Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of anastylosis, where original elements are combined with modern material. It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration. The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers. The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).

The work has come under some criticism. It is felt by some, such as human rights activist Abdullah Hamadi, that the empty niches should be left as monuments to the fanaticism of the Taliban, while others believe the money could be better spent on housing and electricity for the region. Some people, including Habiba Sarabi, the provincial governor, believe that rebuilding the Buddhas would increase tourism, which would aid the surrounding communities.

===Rise of the Buddhas with 3D light projection===
After fourteen years, on 7 June 2015, a Chinese adventurist couple Zhang Xinyu and Liang Hong filled the empty cavities where the Buddhas once stood with 3D laser light projection technology. The projector used for the installation, worth approximately $120,000, was donated by Zhang and Liang, who were saddened by the destruction of the statues. With the desire of paying tribute, they requested permission from UNESCO and the Afghan government to do the project. About 150 local people came out to see the unveiling of the holographic statues.

===Replicas===
The destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan inspired attempts to construct replicas of the Bamyan Buddhas. These include the following.

* In 2001 in China, carving of a high Buddha was initiated in Sichuan, which is the same height as the smaller of the two Bamiyan Buddhas. It was funded by a Chinese businessman, Liang Simian. The project appears to have been given up for unknown reasons.
* In Sri Lanka, a full-scale replica has been created, which is now known as the Tsunami Honganji Viharaya at Pareliya. It is dedicated to the victims of the 2005 tsunami in the presence of Mahinda Rajapaksha. It was funded by Japan&#x27;s Hongan-ji Temple of Kyoto and was inaugurated in 2006.
* In Poland, the Arkady Fiedler Museum of Tolerance has a replica of a Bamiyan Buddha.
* An stone Buddha was inaugurated at Sarnath in India in 2011. It stands within the Thai Buddhist Vihara.

== Gallery ==
==In popular culture==
Despite the Buddhas&#x27;s destruction, the ruins continue to be a popular culture landmark, bolstered by increasing domestic and international tourism to the Bamyan Valley. The area around the ruins has since been used for the traditional game of buzkashi, and other events. The music video of pop singer Aryana Sayeed&#x27;s hit 2015 song &quot;Yaar-e Bamyani&quot; was also shot by the ruins. The statues inspired Islamic writers in historical times. The larger statue appears as the malevolent giant Salsal in medieval Turkish tales.

In June 1971, Empress Michiko of Japan visited the Buddhas during an Imperial state visit to the Kingdom of Afghanistan with her husband. Upon her return to Japan, she composed a waka poem.

A 2012 novel by Rajesh Talwar titled &quot;An Afghan Winter&quot; provides a fictional backdrop to the destruction of the Buddhas and its impact on the global Buddhist community.

The 2022 Indian film &quot;Ram Setu&quot; shows the destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan and an archaeological team&#x27;s subsequent attempts to salvage the remains where they discover a fictional treasure belonging to Raja Dahir and a colossal reclining Buddha (which has been described in the writings of Xuanzang but has not actually been discovered).

The AD 507 chapter of 2020 novel &quot;A Traveller at the Gates of Wisdom&quot; by John Boyne writes an imaginary account of how the Buddhas were commissioned and built.

<text>Michael Wayne Campbell (born February 1, 1950) is an American guitarist and vocalist. He was a member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and co-wrote many of the band&#x27;s hits with Petty, including &quot;Refugee&quot;, &quot;Here Comes My Girl&quot;, &quot;You Got Lucky&quot;, and &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot;. Outside of The Heartbreakers, he has worked as a session guitarist and songwriter with a number of other acts, including composing and playing on the Don Henley hits &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; &amp; &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot; as well as working on most of Stevie Nicks&#x27;s solo albums. Campbell, along with Neil Finn, joined Fleetwood Mac to replace lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on their world tour in 2018–2019. After the end of that tour, he has been involved in his own band, the Dirty Knobs. As of 2024, the Dirty Knobs have released three albums.

On November 11, 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named Campbell in their list of the top 100 guitarists, coming in at number 79. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 as a member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.

== Early years ==
Campbell was born on February 1, 1950, in Panama City, Florida. He grew up there and in Jacksonville, Florida, where he graduated from Jean Ribault High School in 1968. At the age of 16, his mother, Helen Barber, bought him his first guitar, a Harmony acoustic model which he later described as &quot;unplayable&quot; from a pawnshop. His first electric guitar was a $60 Guyatone, but playing a friend&#x27;s Gibson SG (a model which Campbell would not own himself for many years) was a transformative experience. Like Tom Petty, Campbell drew his strongest influences from The Byrds and Bob Dylan, with additional inspiration coming from guitarists such as Scotty Moore, Luther Perkins, George Harrison, Carl Wilson, Jerry Garcia, Roger McGuinn, Keith Richards, Brian Jones, Jimmy Page, Mick Taylor, and Neil Young. The first song he learned to play was &quot;Baby Let Me Follow You Down,&quot; a song which appeared on Dylan&#x27;s eponymous debut album. He formed a band named Dead or Alive which quickly disbanded.

Campbell met Tom Petty through drummer Randall Marsh. Marsh was auditioning to be in Petty&#x27;s band Mudcrutch and learned that Mudcrutch had recently lost their guitarist. He suggested that Petty try Campbell, who was his roommate and had actually been listening to the conversation in the next room. Campbell impressed Petty with his version of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; and was offered a spot in the band. Mudcrutch became a popular act around Gainesville and north Florida in the early 1970s. They relocated to Los Angeles in 1974 and signed a record deal with Shelter Records, but released only one poor-selling single and broke up soon after.

== Tom Petty &amp; The Heartbreakers ==

In 1976, Campbell rejoined Petty to begin Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with former Mudcrutch member Benmont Tench (keyboards) along with Ron Blair (bass guitar) and Stan Lynch (drums).

Like the other Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso approach to playing, preferring to have his work serve the needs of each song.

Campbell co-produced the Heartbreakers albums &quot;Southern Accents&quot;, &quot;Pack Up the Plantation: Live!&quot;, &quot;Let Me Up (I&#x27;ve Had Enough)&quot;, &quot;Into the Great Wide Open&quot;, &quot;Songs and Music from &quot;She&#x27;s the One&quot;&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;The Last DJ&quot;, &quot;The Live Anthology&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot;, as well as the Petty solo albums &quot;Full Moon Fever&quot;, &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, and &quot;Highway Companion&quot;. His sole vocal contribution to the group was on the track &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Fight&quot; on &quot;Echo&quot;.

Campbell collaborated, recorded, and toured with Tom Petty for almost 50 years. His last live performance with the Heartbreakers was on September 25, 2017, at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. Tom Petty died unexpectedly about one week later, on October 2.

== Side projects ==
In 1997, Campbell co-founded the Blue Stingrays with Heartbreakers member Ron Blair and Mudcrutch member Randall Marsh, and released their one album the same year.

In 2007, he joined a reformed Mudcrutch with Petty, Tench, Marsh, and Tom Leadon; they debuted in 2008 with a tour and an album. The band returned in 2016 for another album and tour before Petty&#x27;s death.

On April 9, 2018, Fleetwood Mac announced that Campbell would be joining the band along with Neil Finn to replace lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham for their 2018–19 world tour. In March 2022, Campbell announced that he had not worked with Fleetwood Mac after 2019, and that he had moved on.

== The Dirty Knobs ==
While in the Heartbreakers, Campbell was lead singer and guitarist with a side band, the Dirty Knobs, with guitarist Jason Sinay, drummer Matt Laug, and bassist Lance Morrison. &quot;It&#x27;s rougher-edged [than Petty&#x27;s material],&quot; Campbell says of the group, &quot;It&#x27;s slightly over-driven, less polished, lots of Sixties influence: The Kinks, Led Zeppelin, The Animals. It&#x27;s something I probably should have done a long time ago, but I didn&#x27;t &#x27;cause I was wrapped up in the Heartbreakers.&quot; They released a single, &quot;Feelin&#x27; High&quot;, in 2010. Jason Sinay left the band in 2022 to focus on his solo career. His replacement is Texas guitarist Chris Holt, who has played with Don Henley and Max Weinberg.

The band released the title track from its debut album, &quot;Wreckless Abandon&quot;, in January 2020, followed by the album itself in November of that year. The album was produced by Campbell and George Drakoulias, who with Tom Petty produced Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&#x27; &quot;The Last D.J.&quot; The cover art was by Klaus Voormann who created the cover of The Beatles &quot;Revolver.&quot;

In the summer of 2021, the band released a new single, a cover of J. J. Cale&#x27;s &quot;Humdinger&quot;.

In April 2022, the band released their second album, &quot;External Combustion&quot;.

In 2023, Matt Laug became the touring drummer for AC/DC and former Heartbreaker, Steve Ferrone, was brought in on drums.

On May 7, 2024, the band released a new song and video, &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; from their third album, &quot;Vagabonds, Virgins &amp; Misfits&quot;, released on June 14, 2024.

<doc id="588220" wikidata="Q202687" url="?curid=588220" title="Songhai Empire">
<text>The Songhai Empire was a state located in the western part of the Sahel during the 15th and 16th centuries. At its peak, it was one of the largest African empires in history. The state is known by its historiographical name, derived from its largest ethnic group and ruling elite, the Songhai people. Sonni Ali established Gao as the empire&#x27;s capital, although a Songhai state had existed in and around Gao since the 11th century. Other important cities in the kingdom were Timbuktu and Djenné, where urban-centred trade flourished; they were conquered in 1468 and 1475, respectively. Initially, the Songhai Empire was ruled by the Sonni dynasty (–1493), but it was later replaced by the Askia dynasty (1493–1591).

During the second half of the 13th century, Gao and the surrounding region had grown into an important trading centre and attracted the interest of the expanding Mali Empire. Mali conquered Gao near the end of the 13th century. Gao remained under Malian command until the late 14th century. As the Mali Empire started disintegrating, the Songhai reasserted control of Gao. Songhai rulers subsequently took advantage of the weakened Mali Empire to expand Songhai rule.

Under the rule of Sonni Ali, the Songhai surpassed the Malian Empire in area, wealth, and power, absorbing vast regions of the Mali Empire. His son and successor, Sonni Bāru, was overthrown by Muhammad Ture, one of his father&#x27;s generals. Ture, more commonly known as Askia the Great, instituted political and economic reforms throughout the empire.

A series of plots and coups by Askia&#x27;s successors forced the empire into a period of decline and instability. Askia&#x27;s relatives attempted to govern the kingdom, but political chaos and several civil wars within the empire ensured the empire&#x27;s continued decline, particularly during the rule of Askia Ishaq I. The empire experienced a period of stability and a string of military successes during the reign of Askia Daoud.

Askia Ishaq II, the last ruler of the Songhai Empire, ascended to power in a long dynastic struggle following the death of Daoud. In 1590, Al-Mansur took advantage of the recent civil conflict in the empire and sent an army under the command of Judar Pasha to conquer the Songhai and gain control of the trans-Saharan trade routes. The Songhai Empire collapsed after the defeat at the Battle of Tondibi in 1591.

== Name ==
The Songhai Empire has been variously translated in texts as Zagha, Zaghai, Zaghaya, Sughai, Zaghay, Zaggan, Izghan, Zaghawa, Zuwagha, Zawagha, Zauge, Azuagha, Azwagha, Sungee, Sanghee, Songhai, Songhay, Sughai, Zanghi, Zingani, Zanj, Zahn, Zaan, Zarai, Dyagha, and possibly Znaga.

== History ==
=== Early inhabitants ===
In ancient times somewhere surmised between the 9th and 3rd centuries BCE, several different groups of people collectively formed the Songhai identity, centered around the developing hub of ancient Kukiya. Among the first people to settle in the region of Gao were the Sorko people, who established small settlements on the banks of Niger. The Sorko fashioned boats and canoes from the wood of the cailcedrat tree, fished and hunted from their ships, and provided water-borne transport for goods and people. Another group of people that moved into the area to live off of Niger&#x27;s resources were the Gao people. The Gao were hunters and specialized in hunting river animals such as crocodiles and hippopotamus.

The other group known to have inhabited the area were the Do people, farmers who raised crops in the fertile lands bordering the river. Before the 10th century, these early settlers were subjugated by more powerful, horse-riding Songhai speakers, who established control over the area. All these groups gradually began to speak the same language, and they and their country eventually became known as the Songhai.

=== Gao and Mali ===
The earliest dynasty of kings is obscure, and most information about it comes from an ancient cemetery near a village called Saney, close to Gao. Inscriptions on a few of the tombstones in the cemetery indicate that this dynasty ruled in the late 11th and early 12th centuries and that its rulers were given the title of &quot;Malik&quot; (Arabic for &quot;King&quot;). Other tombstones mention a second dynasty whose rulers bore the title &quot;zuwa&quot;. Only myth and legend describe the origins of the &quot;zuwa&quot;. The &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; (&quot;History of Sudan&quot;), written in Arabic around 1655, provides an early history of the Songhai as handed down through oral tradition. It reports that the founder of the Za dynasty was called Za Alayaman (also spelt Dialliaman), who originally came from Yemen and settled in the town of Kukiya. What happened to the Zuwa rulers is yet to be recorded.

The Sanhaja tribes were among the early people of the Niger Bend region. These tribes rode out of the Sahara Desert and established trading settlements near the Niger. As time passed, North African traders crossed the Sahara and joined the Tuaregs in their settlements. Both groups conducted business with the people living near the river. As trade in the region increased, the Songhai chiefs took control of the profitable trade around what would later become Gao. Trade goods included gold, salt, slaves, kola nuts, leather, dates, and ivory. 

By the 10th century, the Songhai chiefs had established Gao as a small kingdom, taking control of the people living along the trade routes. Around 1300, Gao had become prosperous enough to attract the Mali Empire&#x27;s attention. Mali conquered the city, profited from Gao&#x27;s trade, and collected taxes from its kings until about the 1430s. Conflict in the Malian homeland made it impossible to maintain control of Gao. Ibn Battuta visited Gao in 1353 when the town was still a part of the Mali Empire. He arrived by boat from Timbuktu on his return journey from visiting the capital of the empire, writing:Then I travelled to the town of Kawkaw, which is a great town on the Nīl [Niger], one of the finest, biggest, and most fertile cities of the Sūdān. There is much rice there, milk, chickens, fish, and the cucumber, which has no like. Its people conduct their buying and selling with cowries, like the people of Mālī.

=== Independence===
Following the death of Mansa Sulayman in 1360, disputes over who should succeed him weakened the Mali Empire. The reign of Mari Djata II left the empire in poor financial condition, but the kingdom itself passed intact to Musa II. Mari Djata, Musa&#x27;s &quot;kankoro-sigui&quot;, put down a Tuareg rebellion in Takedda and attempted to quell the Songhai rebellion in Gao. While he succeeded in Takedda, he did not re-subjugate Gao. Another round of dynastic instability in the 1380s and 90s likely allowed the Songhai to formalize their independence under Sunni Muhammad Dao. In the 1460s, Sonni Sulayman Dama attacked Méma, the Mali province west of Timbuktu.

===Sonni Ali===

After the death of Sulayman Dama, Sonni Ali reigned from 1464 to 1492. Unlike the previous Songhai kings, Ali sought to honour the traditional religion of his people, taught to him by his mother of the Dendi people. This earned him the reputation of a tyrant by Islamic Scholars.

During his campaigns for expansion, Ali conquered several territories, repelling attacks from the Mossi to the south and conquering the Dogon people to the north. He annexed Timbuktu in 1468 after the leaders of the town asked him to help overthrow the Tuaregs, who had taken the city following the decline of Mali. When he attempted to conquer the trading town of Djenné, the townspeople resisted his efforts. After a seven-year siege, he was able to starve them into surrender, incorporating the town into his empire in 1473.

The invasion of Sonni Ali and his forces negatively impacted Timbuktu. Many Muslim accounts described him as a tyrant, including the Tarikh al-fattash, which Mahmud Kati wrote. According to &quot;The Cambridge History of Africa&quot;, the Islamic historian Al-Sa&#x27;di expresses this sentiment in describing his incursion on Timbuktu:

Sonni Ali created a policy against the scholars of Timbuktu, especially those of the Sankore region who were associated with the Tuareg. With his control of critical trade routes and cities such as Timbuktu, Sonni Ali increased the wealth of the Songhai Empire, which at its height would surpass the wealth of Mali.

===Askia the Great===

Sonni Ali was succeeded by Askia the Great. He organized the territories his predecessor conquered and extended his power to the south and the east. Under his rule, the Songhai military possessed a full-time corps of warriors. Askia is said to have cynical attitudes towards kingdoms lacking professional fighting forces. Al-Sa&#x27;di, the chronicler who wrote the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;, compared Askiya&#x27;s army to that of his predecessor:

&quot;he distinguished between the civilian and the army unlike Sunni Ali [1464–92] when everyone was a soldier.&quot;

He opened religious schools, constructed mosques, and opened his court to scholars and poets from throughout the Muslim world. His children went to an Islamic school, and he enforced Islamic practices but did not force religion on his people. Askia completed one of the Five Pillars of Islam by taking a hajj to Mecca, bringing a large amount of gold. He donated some of it to charity and spent the rest on gifts for the people of Mecca to display his empire&#x27;s wealth. Historians from Cairo said his pilgrimage consisted of &quot;an escort of 500 cavalry and 1000 infantry, and with him he carried 300,000 pieces of gold&quot;.

Islam was so important to him that, upon his return, he established more learning centres throughout his empire and recruited Muslim scholars from Egypt and Morocco to teach at the Sankore Mosque in Timbuktu.

He was interested in astronomy, which led to increased astronomers and observatories in the capital.

Askia initiated multiple military campaigns, including declaring Jihad against the neighbouring Mossi. He did not force them to convert to Islam after subduing them. His army consisted of war canoes, a cavalry, protective armour, iron-tipped weapons, and an organized militia.

He centralized the administration of the empire and established a bureaucracy responsible for tax collection and the administration of justice. He demanded the building of canals to enhance agriculture, eventually increasing trade. He introduced a system of weights and measures and appointed an inspector for each of Songhai&#x27;s major trading centres.

During his reign, Islam became more entrenched, trans-Saharan trade flourished, and the salt mines of Taghaza were brought within the empire&#x27;s boundaries.

=== Decline and Saadian Invasion ===
In 1528, Askia&#x27;s children revolted against him, declaring his son Askia Musa king. Following Musa&#x27;s overthrow in 1531, the Songhai Empire went into decline. Following the death of Emperor Askia Daoud in 1583, a war of succession weakened the Songhai Empire and split it into two feuding factions. 

During this period, Moroccan armies annihilated a Portuguese invasion at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, but were left on the verge of economic depletion and bankruptcy, as they needed to pay for the defences used to hold off the siege. This led Sultan Ahmad I al-Mansur of the Saadi dynasty in 1591 to dispatch an invasion force south under the eunuch Judar Pasha. The Moroccan invasion of Songhai was mainly to seize and revive the trans-Saharan trade in salt, gold and slaves for their developing sugar industry. During Askia&#x27;s reign, the Songhai military consisted of full-time soldiers, but the king never modernized his army. On the other hand, the invading Moroccan army included thousands of arquebusiers and eight English cannons.

Judar Pasha was a Spaniard by birth but had been captured as an infant and educated at the Saadi court. After a march across the Sahara desert, Judar&#x27;s forces captured, plundered, and razed the salt mines at Taghaza and moved on to Gao. When Emperor Askia Ishaq II (r. 1588–1591) met Judar at the 1591 Battle of Tondibi, Songhai forces, despite vastly superior numbers, were routed by a cattle stampede triggered by the Saadi&#x27;s gunpowder weapons. Judar proceeded to sack Gao, Timbuktu and Djenné, destroying the Songhai as a regional power. Governing so vast an empire proved too much for the Saadi dynasty. They soon relinquished control of the region, letting it splinter into dozens of smaller kingdoms.
After the empire&#x27;s defeat, the nobles moved south to an area known today as Songhai in current Niger, where the Sonni dynasty had already settled. They formed smaller kingdoms such as Wanzarbe, Ayerou, Gothèye, Dargol, Téra, Sikié, Kokorou, Gorouol, Karma, Namaro and further south, the Dendi which rose to prominence shortly after.

==Organization==
The original Songhai Empire only included the area from the region of Timbuktu to the east of Gao. Provinces were created after a military expansion under Sonni Ali and Askiya, whose territory was divided into three military zones:

*The &quot;kurma&quot;, where the &quot;Balama&quot;, the minister of defence of the empire and general-in-chief of the armies in charge of military surveillance of the western provinces, including Mali, was based. The western garrisons were stationed there, and the Balama resided with part of the naval fleet in the port of Kabara. The other important personality was the Kurma Fari, who acted as governor and lived in Timbuktu, the provincial capital.

*The capital city of Gao, where the emperor resided with the central garrisons and part of the fleet commanded by the &quot;Hikoy&quot;, the admiral of the empire stationed at the port of Gao with more than a thousand ships at its height. It was wheremost large-scale military campaigns started. The emperor was assisted in his military province in the south by the &quot;Tondi farma&quot;, governor of the province of Hombori, and in the north by the &quot;Surgukoy&quot;, the Amenokal of Tademekat and chief of the Berbers, in charge of the Saharan provinces and possessing a Camel cavalry army.

*The &quot;Dendifari&quot; led the eastern province of Dendi. This provincial governor has stationed a garrison in charge of the surveillance of the eastern provinces, including the Hausa kingdoms. The fleet was stationed at the port of Ayorou.

The Songhai Empire at its zenith extended over the current territories of Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Mauritania, Senegal, most other Guinean Coast countries and Algeria. Its influence stretched as far as Cameroon over a vast contiguous ethnolinguistic, cultural, and political space of Mandé peoples, Gur, Dogon, Berbers, Arab, Fula, Wolof, Hausa, Soninke people, Akan people, and Yoruba people.

An elite of Songhai horsemen led this population from nomadic Nilo-Saharan riders of the Neolithic coming from East Africa to mix with the Sorko fishing population and local Niger-Congo agriculturalists of the Niger River.

==Culture==
At its peak, Timbuktu became a thriving cultural and commercial centre. Arab, Italian, and Jewish merchants all gathered for trade. A revival of Islamic scholarship took place at the university in Timbuktu.

===Economy===

Overland trade in the Sahel and river trade along the Niger were the primary sources of Songhai wealth. Trade along the West African coast was only possible in the late 1400s. Several dikes were constructed during the reign of Sonni Ali, which enhanced the irrigation and agricultural yield of the empire.

Overland trade was influenced by four factors: camels, Berber tribe members, Islam, and the structure of the empire. Gold was readily available in West Africa, but salt was not, so the gold-salt trade was the backbone of overland trade routes in the Sahel. Ivory, ostrich feathers, and slaves were sent north in exchange for salt, horses, camels, cloth, and art. While many trade routes were used, the Songhai heavily used the way through the Fezzan via Bilma, Agades, and Gao.

The Niger River was essential to trade for the empire. Goods were offloaded from camels onto either donkeys or boats at Timbuktu. From there, they were moved along a 500-mile corridor upstream to Djenné or downstream to Gao.

The &quot;Julla&quot; (merchants) would form partnerships, and the state would protect the merchants and port cities along Niger. Askia Muhammad I implemented a universal system of weights and measures throughout the empire.

The Songhai economy was based on a clan system. The clan a person belonged to ultimately decided one&#x27;s occupation. The most common occupations were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. The lower castes mainly consisted of immigrants, who, at times, were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders. At the bottom were prisoners of war and enslaved people who mainly worked in agriculture. The Songhai used slaves more consistently than their predecessors, the Ghana and Mali empires. James Olson described the Songhai labour system as resembling trade unions, with the kingdom possessing craft guilds that consisted of various mechanics and artisans.

===Criminal justice===
Criminal justice in Songhai was based mainly, if not entirely, on Islamic principles, especially during the rule of Askia Muhammad. The local &quot;qadis&quot; were, in addition to this, responsible for maintaining order by following &quot;Sharia&quot; law under Islamic domination, according to the Qur&#x27;an. An additional &quot;qadi&quot; was noted as a necessity to settle minor disputes between immigrant merchants. Kings usually did not judge a defendant; however, under exceptional circumstances, such as acts of treason, they felt obligated to do so and thus exerted their authority. Results of a trial were announced by the &quot;town crier&quot;, and punishment for most trivial crimes usually consisted of confiscation of merchandise or even imprisonment since various prisons existed throughout the Empire.

&quot;Qadis&quot; worked locally in important trading towns like Timbuktu and Djenné. The king appointed the Qadi and dealt with common-law misdemeanours according to Sharia law. The Qadi also had the power to grant a pardon or offer refuge. The &quot;Assara-munitions&quot;, or &quot;enforcers&quot;, worked like a police commissioner whose sole duty was to execute sentencing. Jurists were mainly composed of representatives of the academic community; professors were often noted as taking administrative positions within the Empire, and many aspired to be &quot;qadis&quot;.

===Government===
The upper classes in society converted to Islam, while the lower classes often continued to follow traditional religions. Sermons emphasized obedience to the king. Timbuktu was the educational capital. Sonni Ali established a system of government under the royal court, later to be expanded by Askia Muhammad, which appointed governors and mayors to preside over local tributary states around the Niger Valley. These local chiefs were still granted authority over their respective domains if they did not undermine Songhai policy. Departmental positions existed in the central government. The &quot;hi koy&quot; was the fleet commander who performed roles likened to a home affairs minister. &quot;Fari Mondzo&quot; was the minister of agriculture who administered the state&#x27;s agricultural estates. The &quot;Kalisa farm&quot; has been described by historians such as Ki-Zerbo to be the finance minister who supervised the empire&#x27;s treasury. &quot;Korey Farma&quot; was also the &quot;minister in charge of White foreigners.&quot;

The tax was imposed on peripheral chiefdoms and provinces to ensure Songhai&#x27;s dominance; in return, these provinces were given almost complete autonomy. Songhai rulers only intervened in the affairs of these neighbouring states when a situation became volatile, usually an isolated incident. Each town was represented by government officials, holding positions and responsibilities similar to today&#x27;s central bureaucrats.

Under Askia Muhammad, the Empire saw increased centralization. He encouraged learning in Timbuktu by rewarding its professors with larger pensions as an incentive. He also established an order of precedence and protocol and was noted as a nobleman who gave back generously to people experiencing poverty. Under his policies, Muhammad brought much stability to Songhai, and great attestations of this registered organization are still preserved in the works of Maghreb writers such as Leo Africanus, among others.

=== Religion ===
The Sonni dynasty practised Islam while maintaining many aspects of the original Songhai traditions, unlike their successors, the Askiya dynasty. Askia Mohammed I oversaw a complete Islamic revival and made a pilgrimage to Mecca.

== Military ==

The Songhai armed forces included a navy led by a &quot;hikoy&quot; (admiral), a cavalry of mounted archers, an infantry, and a camel cavalry. They trained herds of long-horned bulls in the imperial stables to charge at the enemy in battle. Vultures were also used to harass opposing camps.

The emperor was the strategist and commander-in-chief of the military, and the &quot;balama&quot; acted as minister of defence and army general. The &quot;janky&quot; was the army corps general, and the &quot;wonky&quot; were lieutenants in charge of a garrison. The head of the mounted archers was called the &quot;tongue farma&quot;. The &quot;hike&quot; was second in the chain of command of the empire and served as its interior minister. He was assisted by two vice-admirals at the ports of Kabara and Ayourou and commanded over a thousand captains, ensuring the rapid movement of troops along the Niger River.

The infantry was led by a general called the &quot;nyay hurry&quot; (war elephant), and the camel cavalry, called &quot;gu&quot;, was led by the &quot;guy&quot;, or cavalry chief. The cavalry mainly consisted of Berbers recruited from the northern provinces.

The Songhai included three military provinces, and an army was stationed in each. It was divided into several garrisons, the &quot;kurmina&quot;, led by the &quot;balama&quot;, the central province by the emperor himself and the &quot;dendi&quot; by the &quot;dendi fari&quot;. The army of the closest military province was mobilized with that of the emperor. Those remaining on the spot ensured order in the three provinces; the emperor was obliged to be in front of the armed during a war of conquest. The Jinakoy ruled secondary provinces and their lieutenants in the regions of the provinces.

According to Potholm, the Songhai army was dominated by heavy cavalry of &quot;mounted knights outfitted in chain mail and helmets&quot;, similar to medieval European armies. The infantry included a force made up primarily of freemen and captives. Swords, arrows and copper or leather shields made up the arsenal of the Songhai infantry. At the Battle of Tondibi, the Songhai army consisted of 30,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry.

=== Navy ===
The Songhai navy dates to the reign of Sonni Ali, who formed a naval force on the Niger River. 
 The Hi-koi was the commander of the fleet. The state had a large network of ports headed by fishermen such as the Goima-Koi in Gao and the Kabara-Farma in Kabara. They were tasked with various duties which included monitoring the state&#x27;s fleet and the collection of entrance, as well as exit fees. Songhai acquired boats such as the Kanta vessels from the Sorko people who served as tributaries to Songhai. According to a report published by Nordic Africa Institute, the Songhai Kanta &quot;could carry up to 30 tons of goods, i.e. the load capacity of 1,000 men, 200 camels, 300 cattle or a flotilla of 20 regular canoes (Mauny, 1961). Some of these boats had an even greater load capacity of 50 to 80 tons (Tvmowski, 1967).”

<text>Michael Rudolf Knuble ( , ; born July 4, 1972) is a Canadian-born American former professional ice hockey right winger who played in the National Hockey League (NHL). During his 16 NHL seasons, he played for the Detroit Red Wings, New York Rangers, Boston Bruins, Philadelphia Flyers and Washington Capitals.

He was a member of Detroit&#x27;s 1997–98 Stanley Cup championship team, and was a part of the organization during their 1996–97 Stanley Cup. He is the only person who was an NHL teammate with both Wayne Gretzky and Alex Ovechkin. 

==Playing career==
===Collegiate===
Knuble was drafted in the fourth round, 76th overall, by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. He played the next four years at the University of Michigan and was given Second Team CCHA All-Star honors in 1994 and 1995 and NCAA West All-American Team honors in 1995. Following his collegiate career, he made his professional debut in the 1995 Calder Cup playoffs with the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League (AHL).

===Professional===
Knuble spent the entire 1995–96 season and most of the 1996–97 season with the Adirondack Red Wings in the AHL before making his NHL debut with the Detroit Red Wings on March 26, 1997. His debut came against the Colorado Avalanche in the famous &quot;Fight Night at the Joe&quot; match. He played a total of nine regular season games in 1996–97 and none in the 1997 Stanley Cup playoffs. Detroit won the Stanley Cup that season, but Knuble&#x27;s name was not engraved on the Cup since he had not played enough games. However, Detroit repeated as Cup Champions in 1997–98, his first full season in the NHL, and though he only played three playoff games, he met the necessary requirements to have his name engraved on the Cup. Knuble was included on both Stanley Cup winning team pictures in 1997 and 1998

Prior to the 1998–99 season, Detroit traded Knuble to the New York Rangers for a 2000 second-round draft choice (Tomáš Kopecký). Knuble played in all 82 games with the Rangers that season, recording 15 goals and 20 assists. With a month to go in the 1999–2000 season, the Rangers traded him to the Boston Bruins in exchange for Rob DiMaio. After posting 20 points in 82 games in 2000–01 and 14 points in 54 games in 2001–02, Knuble found himself playing left wing on a line with Joe Thornton and Glen Murray beginning in 2002–03. He scored 30 goals and 29 assists in 75 games, good for third on the Bruins.

Knuble enjoyed another solid season in 2003–04, 21 goals and 25 assists in 82 games with the Bruins. During which, he set the NHL record for the fastest two goals to start a game by one player on February 14 against the Florida Panthers. He scored a goal ten seconds into the first period and followed it up with another just 27 seconds into the game. After the season, Knuble signed a three-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers in the off-season. He then played for Linköpings HC of the Swedish Elitserien during the 2004–05 NHL lockout, scoring 26 goals and assisting on 13 others in 49 games.

When the lockout came to an end, Knuble was slotted to play right wing on a line with Simon Gagné and Peter Forsberg, a line which was later nicknamed the &quot;Deuces Wild Line.&quot; He responded with his best season as a professional in 2005–06, recording career highs in goals (34), assists (31) and points (65). On pace to duplicate his numbers despite his team&#x27;s poor season in 2006–07, Knuble&#x27;s season was nearly cut short after a collision with Rangers forward and former Red Wings teammate Brendan Shanahan. After missing a month of action, he returned to the ice and finished with 24 goals and 30 assists in 64 games and brought his plus-minus rating to +2, Knuble being one of two Flyers (Gagné being the other) to finish with a plus rating for the season.

Knuble recorded his first career hat trick on February 2, 2008, scoring all the goals in a 3–0 Flyers win over the Anaheim Ducks. He netted his first career playoff overtime goal on April 17, 2008, scoring the winner during the second overtime of the Flyers&#x27; 4–3 victory over the Washington Capitals. He has traveled to schools in New Jersey and Philadelphia teaching kids about hockey in his free time.

On July 1, 2009, Knuble signed a two-year deal worth $2.8 million a season with the Washington Capitals.

On November 13, 2009, in a game against the Minnesota Wild, Knuble broke a finger in the first period and did not finish the game. He returned on December 11 after missing four weeks of action. Knuble scored Washington&#x27;s first goal in the second period of the 2011 NHL Winter Classic against Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; goaltender Marc-André Fleury.

On April 11, 2011, Knuble was re-signed to a one-year, $2 million contract extension with the Capitals. During the 2011–12 season, on December 20, 2011, Knuble played in his 1,000th NHL game. At that time, Knuble had scored 221 NHL goals since turning age 30.

On January 24, 2013, Knuble signed a one-year deal to return to the Philadelphia Flyers.

==Coaching==

Knuble is currently an assistant coach with the Grand Rapids Griffins, Detroit&#x27;s minor league affiliate.

==Personal life==
Born in Toronto, Ontario, Knuble was raised with younger brother Steve in Kentwood, Michigan, by his Latvian-born parents, Aivars and Māra (Miesnieks) Knuble. Because he was born in Canada, Mike has dual Canadian/American citizenship. His father Aivars died of a heart attack at the age of 45 in 1987 when Mike was 15 years old.

Knuble is married to wife Megan. Together they have three children. Cam Knuble was playing hockey in the USHL with the Muskegon Lumberjacks in January 2018. Cole Knuble was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers in 2023.

Mike&#x27;s brother Steve, who attended Michigan State University, lives in Huntsville, Alabama, but has run a hockey clinic in Ann Arbor, Michigan, since 1996.

The Knuble family are currently living in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he was raised as a child.

<doc id="588224" wikidata="Q69411" url="?curid=588224" title="Karl Freiherr von Müffling">
<text>Friedrich Karl Ferdinand Freiherr von Müffling, nicknamed Weiss (12 June 177510 January 1851), was a Prussian &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; and military theorist. He served as Blücher&#x27;s liaison officer in Wellington&#x27;s headquarters during the Battle of Waterloo and was one of the organizers of the final victory over Napoleon. After the wars he served a diplomatic role at the Congress of Aix-la-Chappelle and was a major contributor to the development of the Prussian General Staff as Chief. Müffling also specialized in military topography and cartography.

==Biography==
Born in Halle, Müffling entered the Prussian army in 1790.

In 1799 Müffling contributed to a military dictionary edited by Lieutenant W. von Leipziger, and in the winter of 1802–1803, being then a subaltern, he was appointed to the newly formed general staff as quartermaster-lieutenant. He had already done survey work, and was now charged with survey duties under the astronomer Franz Xaver, Baron Von Zach (1754–1832). In 1805, when in view of a war with France the army was placed on a war footing, Müffling was promoted captain and assigned to the general staffs, successively, of General von Wartensleben, Frederick Louis, Prince of Hohenlohe-Ingelfingen and Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher.

In 1806 Müffling served under Hohenlohe, Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, and Blücher, and was included in the capitulation of the latter&#x27;s corps at Ratekau on 7 November 1806, the day after the Battle of Lübeck. After this he entered the civil service of the Duke of Weimar. He rejoined the army on the outbreak of the German Campaign of 1813, and was placed on the headquarters staff of the Army of Silesia.

The death of Gerhard von Scharnhorst from a wound received at Lützen forced a reorganization of the Prussian Army&#x27;s command. August von Gneisenau succeeded Scharnhorst as Chief of Staff to Blucher. Müffling in turn was appointed as his deputy (&quot;Generalquartiermeister&quot;), although Gneisenau would have preferred Carl von Clausewitz.

His business qualities and common sense were greatly valued, though the temperamental differences between Müffling and Gneisenau often led to friction, especially as the former was in a measure the representative of the antiquated topographical school of strategists, to whom (rightly in the main) the disaster of the Battle of Jena was attributed. In the interval between the first occupation of Paris and the Hundred Days, Müffling served as chief of the staff to the Russian General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly and to General Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf. He was Prussian commissioner at the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s headquarters in the Waterloo campaign, and was involved in the various controversies which centred round the events at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815.

After the final fall of Napoleon Müffling was a signatory to the Convention of St. Cloud and later served on the staff of the Army of Occupation in France. For some months he was military governor of Paris. He spent a part of his time on the Rhine in survey work, and was employed by King Frederick William III in various diplomatic missions. In 1821 he became chief of the general staff at Berlin, and though he has been accused of indulging his taste for topographical work at the expense of training for war, his work was not wasted, for he gave an excellent organization to the general staff, and executed elaborate and useful surveys. In 1829 he visited Constantinople and St Petersburg in connection with negotiations for peace between Russia and Turkey. He took a prominent part in the military and civil history of Prussia, and from 1838 to 1847 was governor of Berlin. He was also the inventor of a system of hachuring for maps. Failing health compelled his retirement in the latter year, and he died on 10 January 1851, at his estate of Ringhofen.

<doc id="588230" wikidata="Q697344" url="?curid=588230" title="Dornier Do 18">
<text>The Dornier Do 18 was a development of the Do 16 flying boat. It was developed for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, but &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot; received five aircraft and used these for tests between the Azores and the North American continent in 1936 and on their mail route over the South Atlantic from 1937 to 1939.

On 27–29 March 1938, a &quot;Do 18 W&quot; established a seaplane record, flying non-stop a straight distance of 8,391 km (5,214 mi) from Start Point, Devon to Caravelas in Brazil.

==Design and development==
In 1934, the Dornier &quot;Flugzeugwerke&quot; started development of a new twin-engine flying boat to replace the Dornier Do J &quot;Wal&quot; (Whale) in both military and civil roles. The resultant design, &quot;Do 18&quot;, retained the layout of the Wal, with a metal hull fitted with distinctive stabilising sponsons, and powered by two engines above the wing in a push-pull layout, but was aerodynamically and hydrodynamically more efficient. It was planned to be powered by two of the new Junkers Jumo 205 Diesel engines. Although heavy, these promised to give much lower fuel consumption than conventional petrol engines of similar power.

The first prototype, the Do 18a, registration D-AHIS (and named &quot;Monsun&quot; by &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot;) flew on 15 March 1935, powered by two of the earlier 410 kW (550 hp) Junkers Jumo 5c Diesels as the planned Jumo 205s were not yet available. It was lost on 2 November 1935 over the Baltic Sea during high-speed tests. Three further prototypes followed, two (the Do 18d and Do 18b) being prototype military aircraft, and the Do 18c (later redesignated Do 18 V3), a civil prototype.

The Do 18c was delivered to &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot; as a Do 18E civil transport (D-ABYM &quot;Aeolus&quot;), quickly followed by a further two aircraft, (D-AANE &quot;Zyklon&quot; and D-ARUN &quot;Zephir&quot;) with a final Do 18E (D-AROZ &quot;Pampero&quot;) being built in 1938.

A further civil Do 18 was the Do 18F, a modified aircraft with longer wingspan and higher weights built for extended-range flights. The sole Do 18F, D-ANHR, first flew on 11 June 1937. It was later modified with 656 kW (880 hp) BMW 132N radial engines to test a possible upgrade for the Luftwaffe&#x27;s aircraft, flying in this form on 21 November 1939 as the Do 18L. It suffered cooling problems, however, and further development of the radial powered Do 18 was abandoned.

==Operational history==

===Civil service===
In 1936, &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot; started a series of endurance trials, culminating on 10–11 September when &quot;Zephir&quot;, flown by &quot;Flugkapitän&quot; Blankenburg with Deutsche Luft Hansa Director Freiherr von Gablenz as passenger, was launched by catapult from the seaplane tender &quot;Schwabenland&quot; at Horta, Azores, flying the 4,460 km (2,270 mi) to New York City in 22 hours 12 minutes. Also on 11 September, &quot;Aeolus&quot; flew from Horta to Hamilton, Bermuda in 18 hours 15 minutes, continuing to New York the next day. For the main leg of the North Atlantic the aircraft needed the help of the catapult on &quot;Schwabenland&quot;. On 22 September &quot;Aeolus&quot; returned to Horta in 17:50 h (3850 km). &quot;Zephir&quot; was catapulted on 28 September at Hamilton. Further flights to New York followed on 5–6 and 6–7 October and the return flights this time, 17 and 18 October from Sydney, Nova Scotia. The flying boats did not wait for their tender and went on to Lisbon and Travemünde.

In April 1937, D-ARUN &quot;Zephir&quot; and D-ABYM &quot;Aeolus&quot; started service on the South Atlantic mail route from Bathurst, now Banjul, Gambia to Natal, Brazil (3040 km). Catapult ships were based in Bathurst and Fernando de Noronha to allow the aircraft to cross the Atlantic carrying a full load of mail.

In June they were joined by V6 D-AROZ &quot;Pampero&quot;. &quot;Aeolus&quot; was lost on 30 July 1937, when it had to make an ocean landing due to engine problems and was heavily damaged when Ostmark tried to retrieve the plane. &quot;Pampero&quot; (20 August) and &quot;Zephir&quot; (29 January 1938) also had to make ocean landings. &quot;Pampero&quot; was lost at sea nearly without trace on 1 October 1938 with a crew of five.

&quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot;″s fifth aircraft was the only Do 18F V7 D-ANNE &quot;Zyklon&quot;, that first took to the skies on 11 June 1937. This was the only Do 18 with a wider span, which enabled it to stay in the air with one engine out. This was a special demand of &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot;. &quot;Zyklon&quot; was used over the South Atlantic between September 1937 and March 1939. The Do 18s crossed the South Atlantic 73 times.

&quot;Zyklon&quot; is not the aircraft that established the England to Brazil distance record from 27–29 March 1938 as often stated.
The record-setting aircraft D-ANHR was taken from the military production line and was specially prepared. It was flown as a builder&#x27;s machine with a &quot;Deutsche Luft Hansa&quot; crew augmented by the works pilot &quot;Gundermann&quot;. On the way back to the South American station the seaplane tender &quot;Westfalen&quot; took the aircraft into the English Channel where it was catapulted to Brazil. On the record flight the conditions were not optimal and the Do 18 did not reach Rio de Janeiro as planned.

===Military use===
In &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service, it was obsolete by the outbreak of World War II, but, as the only military flying boat, 62 (58 serviceable) Do 18s equipped a Staffel in each of five Kürstenfliegergruppen (Coastal aviation groups) mainly on North Sea reconnaissance missions. In 1940 some squadrons changed their base to Norway. The vulnerable and underpowered flying boat was soon relegated to training and the air/sea rescue role. In the middle of 1941, only one squadron was still operational on Do 18. The Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 had superseded the Dornier.

A Do 18 was the first German aircraft to be shot down by British aircraft during the war, when one of a formation of three was caught over the North Sea by nine Fleet Air Arm Blackburn Skua fighter-bombers of 803 Naval Air Squadron flying from on 26 September 1939. The flying boat was able to make an emergency landing but was sunk by the destroyer .

<doc id="588233" wikidata="Q541312" url="?curid=588233" title="West Kennet Long Barrow">
<text>The West Kennet Long Barrow, also known as South Long Barrow, is a chambered long barrow near the village of Avebury in the south-western English county of Wiltshire. Probably constructed in the thirty-seventh century BC, during Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic period, today it survives in a partially reconstructed state.

Archaeologists have established that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, the West Kennet Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows in Western Britain, now known as the Cotswold-Severn Group. Of these, it is part of a cluster of around thirty centred on Avebury in the uplands of northern Wiltshire.

Built out of earth, local sarsen megaliths, and oolitic limestone imported from the Cotswolds, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Its precise date of construction is not known. Human bones were placed within the chamber, probably between 3670 and 3635 BC, representing a mixture of men, women, children and adults. There is then an apparent hiatus in the use of the site as a place of burial, probably lasting over a century. Between 3620 and 3240 BC it likely began to be re-used as a burial space, receiving both human and animal remains over a period of several centuries. Various flint tools and ceramic sherds were also placed within it during this time. In the Late Neolithic, the entrance to the long barrow was blocked up with the addition of large sarsen boulders. During the Later Neolithic and Early Bronze Age, the landscape around West Kennet Long Barrow was subject to the widespread construction of ceremonial monuments, among them the Avebury henge and stone circles, the West Kennet Avenue, The Sanctuary, and Silbury Hill.

During the Romano-British period, a small coin hoard was buried in the side of the long barrow. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 17th century, while archaeological excavation took place in 1859 and again in 1955–56, after which it underwent reconstruction. Now a scheduled monument under the guardianship of English Heritage, it is classified as part of the &quot;Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites&quot; UNESCO World Heritage Site and is open without charge to visitors all year round.

==Location==
West Kennet Long Barrow is found near the village of Avebury in central Wiltshire. It occupies a prominent place on the crest of a hill, just above the upper Kennet valley. To the north, it offers views of Avebury, and to the south St Anne&#x27;s Hill and Wansdyke.

==Context==
The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BC, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent.
Britain was largely forested in this period. Throughout most of the island, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.

===The Cotswold-Severn tombs===

Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These structures included chambered long barrows, rectangular or oval earthen tumuli with a chamber built into one end. Some chambers were made of timber, and others using large stones, now known as &quot;megaliths&quot;. Long barrows often served as tombs, housing the dead within their chamber. Bodies were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from south-eastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. Although there are stone buildings—like Göbekli Tepe in modern Turkey—which predate them, the chambered long barrows constitute humanity&#x27;s first widespread tradition of construction using stone.

The archaeologists Joshua Pollard and Andrew Reynolds noted that by the mid-fourth millennium BC, the landscape around Avebury &quot;was being stealthily transformed&quot;.
Around thirty Early Neolithic long barrows are known from the uplands of northern Wiltshire, 17 of which were definitely or probably chambered, the others being unchambered. There may have been more than this during the Early Neolithic, with various examples having been destroyed by agricultural activity over the intervening millennia. The survivors are distributed across an area of northern Wiltshire measuring about 20 kilometres by 15 kilometres, centred near Avebury.

Their landscape locations vary; some are in valley bottoms, others are on hilltops or on the slopes of hills. Intervisibility between them does not appear to have been a relevant factor in their placement, as many have restricted views and may have been surrounded by woodland. Many of those which have been excavated show evidence for having been placed on sites that had already witnessed human activity, such as clearance, cultivation, or occupation. Pollard and Reynolds suggested that this indicated &quot;a genuine attempt to draw upon the past associations of particular places&quot;.

==Design and construction==

It is probable that the site on which West Kennet Long Barrow was built had been used for older human activity. This is evidenced by sherds of a plain bowl that excavators found in soil beneath the monument during the 1950s. The architectural style of the Long Barrow, coupled with the style of the primary interments of human remains, led archaeologists who excavated in the 1950s to believe that it was Early Neolithic in date. A nearby monument, the Windmill Hill causewayed enclosure, revealed three radiocarbon dates which demonstrated that it was Early Neolithic, leading archaeologists to consider an Early Neolithic date for the Long Barrow.

The presence of a kink in the flanking ditches, identified by resistivity survey in the 1960s, has led archaeologists to suggest that the long barrow may have been constructed in several phases. It is possible that the West Kennet Long Barrow was once a smaller movement that underwent expansion during the Early Neolithic period. In this it would compare with another Cotswold-Severn chambered long barrow, Wayland&#x27;s Smithy, which underwent expansion. Several of the long barrows excavated in northern Wiltshire, such as those under South Street and Beckhampton Road, contained small structures prior to the erection of barrows on those sites. Pollard and Reynolds suggested that these may have been &quot;small &#x27;shrines&#x27; perhaps set up to appease local spirits or ancestral guardians&quot;.

===The mound===
West Kennet Long Barrow is 100 metres long and 20 metres wide. The archaeologist Timothy Darvill noted that it was far larger than most long barrows, although comparisons could be seen with other examples such as Long Low in Derbyshire and Colnpen.

A ditch flanks the monument on each side.

===The chamber===

The stone chamber has been characterised as being &quot;more elaborate&quot; than most other examples in the Cotswold-Severn group. It is built from sarsens. It extends for 12 metres inside the barrow. The roof is set between 1.7 metres and 2.2 metres above the chamber floor. This is high enough to allow visitors to stand upright, a rare feature of chambered long barrows. More typical chambered long barrows such as Belas Knap and Uley Long Barrow, have chambers less than one metre in height. Pollard and Reynolds suggested that &quot;this was not a closed space, but one that facilitated ready access to mortuary remains and perhaps allowed a select few to gather periodically within the chambers in order to commune with the dead and ancestors.&quot;

Pollard and Reynolds believed that the inclusion of stone-sharpening stones in the barrow was a deliberate choice made to &quot;appropriate the histories and associations of these stones&quot;. Oolitic limestone was also used in the dry stone walling of West Kennet Long Barrow; it was also used in this manner at Adam&#x27;s Grave, while smaller fragments of this stone were found in unchambered long barrows at Shepherd&#x27;s Store, Easton Down, Horslip, and Kitchen Barrow. This stone does not occur naturally in this area of northern Wiltshire, but would have had to be brought from the area around Frome and Bath. It is possible that it was chosen for inclusion in these monuments because of its associations with a far-off place, because of its aesthetic qualities, or because it was believed to contain the essence of supernatural beings. It is also possible that the builders of these monuments viewed the area of the Cotswolds as their ancestral homeland and that the use of oolitic limestone in these structures was a means of linking themselves to their past.

===Use as a tomb===

Radiocarbon dates retrieved from skeletal material inside the long barrow suggested that the oldest individuals within it died around 3670–3635 calibrated BC (81% probability) or 3575–3545 calibrated BC (14% probability). The last burials in this primary phase occurred in 3640–3610 calibrated BC (77% probability) or 3550–3520 calibrated BC (18% probability). This suggests that the initial use of the long barrow as a burial space lasted only for a &quot;short duration&quot;: 10 to 30 years (68% probability) or 1 to 55 years (94% probability). This data suggested that West Kennet Long Barrow was probably constructed between 3670–3635 calibrated BC (81% probability) or 3575–3745 calibrated BC (14% probability), to house individuals who had only recently died. It is possible that the monument predated the deaths by some time, or that the bones were kept elsewhere prior to being placed in the barrow, in which case the long barrow might be either older or slightly younger.

This initial phase of burial was followed by a hiatus, probably lasting over a century, before a secondary phase of burial began. During this period the long barrow displayed signs of decay, with portions of the drystone walling collapsing. Bayliss et al. suggested that in this period, the West Kennet Long Barrow &quot;was a monument whose fabric and contents were no longer at the forefront of people&#x27;s minds, or no longer accessible.&quot;

According to radiocarbon dating, a secondary phase of burial began in 3620–3240 calibrated BC (95% probability) and lasted until the second half of the third millennium calibrated BC. This secondary stage therefore stretched over a period of centuries. This in-fill was marked by sarsen slabs covering the original inhumations, followed by layers of chalk rubble, earth and sarsen, and human and animal remains. Many of these remains were of young people; the south-east chamber for instance included the bodies of at least five infants.
It is possible that these human remains were collected together over a period of centuries outside the long barrow and only placed within it as part of a single event.

The secondary burial deposits included artefacts alongside the human remains. Flint and bone tools were present. Pottery included Grooved ware, Beaker ware, and all three styles of Peterborough ware: Ebbsfleet, Mortlake, and Fengate. Collectively, this pottery came from at least 250 different vessels. Pollard and Reynolds noted that &quot;even at a conservative estimate&quot;, these ceramic sherds &quot;could span a thousand years&quot;.

===Termination===
During the third millennium BC sarsen boulders and earth were used to partially block the forecourt. In the late third millennium BC, a façade of three large sarsen stones was erected across the forecourt, blocking any further entrance to the chamber. This act may have been roughly contemporary with, or slightly later than, the main stone phases at the Avebury stone circle and the Sanctuary, during the end of the Late Neolithic period and the start of the Early Bronze Age.

The West Kennet Long Barrow, along with the East Kennet Long Barrow and Windmill Hill, are among the features visible from the Sanctuary.

===Meaning and purpose===

Britain&#x27;s Early Neolithic communities placed greater emphasis on the ritual burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears. Archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic Britons adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead, believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants. Early Neolithic people may have entered into the tombs—which doubled as temples or shrines—to perform rituals honouring the dead and requesting their assistance. The historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments &quot;tomb-shrines&quot; to reflect their dual purpose.

In Britain, these tombs were typically sited on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. The archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as landscape markers that conveyed information on &quot;territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors&quot;. Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines were territorial markers between different tribes; others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways. The archaeologist Richard Bradley suggested that the construction of these monuments reflects an attempt to mark control and ownership over the land, showing a change in mindset brought about by the transition from the hunter-gatherer Mesolithic to the pastoralist Early Neolithic. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers.

==Human remains==

Inhumation burials inside the long barrow were discovered by excavation in 1859, and again in 1955–56. In the early 1980s, four of the bones recovered in the 1950s were subject to radiocarbon dating at the University of Oxford. In the early 2000s the bones were re-examined by osteoarchaeologists, who obtained radiocarbon dates from 25 human skeletons and one goat skeleton from inside the barrow. They reported that the 1950s reports made errors in the understandings of these human remains, for instance by failing to always make a distinction between the primary and secondary deposits.

Piggott argued that a total of 43 individuals were included in these primary deposits. Later reassessment of the evidence suggested that there were more likely 36 individuals interred in the long barrow. However, the osteoarchaeologists Martin Smith and Megan Brickley noted that &quot;demographic divisions&quot; proved &quot;hard to discern&quot; among the skeletal material from West Kennet.
The skeletal remains were of both sexes, with the ratio of male and female skeletons being roughly balanced. The remains were also of various ages, as four of the five transepts contained both adults and young people.

The 2000s study found sufficient body parts from at least five people that they could state that these were &quot;probably in an articulated or partially articulated state when deposited.&quot;
Radiocarbon dating indicated that all the individuals interred during the primary phase died at a time period comparatively closely to one another, and that it is possible that they &quot;could have died at the same time&quot;.

One of the skeletons from inside the long barrow, that of an adult male, contained an arrowhead near the throat. This may have been imbedded in the man&#x27;s throat at the time of his death. The barrow also included a small cremation deposit.

==Later history==

Romano-British finds commonly occur in and around Early Neolithic monuments in Britain. Six bronze Roman coins were buried into the topsoil near the sarsen façade and recovered during the 1955–56 excavation.
Romano-British ritual activity is known from the broader area around the long barrow; several shafts were dug around the Shallow Head Springs near Silbury Hill in this period, into which a range of items were placed. In addition, a building that possibly served a religious function was established south of Silbury Hill.

During the late 17th century a Dr R. Toope of Marlborough dug into the barrow looking for human remains that he could use in his preparation of medicines. The site was designated as a monument in 1882.

==Tourism and Modern Paganism==
West Kennet Long Barrow now serves as a tourist attraction. In 1997, the cultural historian Richard Hayman noted that it was &quot;a tomb no more, it has become a sanitised cultural commodity.&quot;

Many modern Pagans view West Kennet Long Barrow as a &quot;temple&quot; and use it for their rituals. Some see it as a place of the ancestors where they can engage in &quot;vision quests&quot; and other neo-shamanic practices. Others have seen it as a womb of the Great Goddess, and as a sort of living entity. The winter solstice has been a particularly popular occasion for Pagans to visit. Modern Pagan visitors have often left items, including tea lights, incense, flowers, fruit, and coins, in the long barrow, often regarding these as offerings to &quot;spirits&quot; which they believe reside there. Various fires lit within the long barrow have left scorch marks and damaged the stones; one of the sarsens had to be glued back together after having been fractured by the heat of fire. Some Pagans have advocated for all human remains found within the barrow to be re-buried within it, after which they believe the chamber should again be sealed.

==Antiquarian and archaeological investigation==

The antiquarian John Aubrey described West Kennet Long Barrow in his manuscript, &quot;Monumenta Britannica&quot;. There, he stated that the barrow did not have a name, also providing an illustration of it. It was again described and illustrated the following century, by the antiquarian William Stukeley. Stukeley named it the South Long Barrow, in reference to its position in respect to Avebury and Silbury Hill. Circa 1814, the long barrow was reported on by the antiquarian Richard Hoare amid his descriptions of the archaeological sites in Wiltshire.

In the autumn of 1859, John Thurnham carried out an excavation at West Kennet Long Barrow under the auspices of the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society. He had previously excavated Uley Long Barrow in Gloucestershire earlier that decade. In excavating at West Kennet, Thurnham used patients from a mental asylum as labourers, presenting it as a form of occupational therapy for them.
Thurnham excavated the western chamber, in which he discovered bones from what he believed were six crouched inhumation burials. In 2009, Smith and Brickley noted that Thurnham&#x27;s &quot;recording remains haphazard and arbitrary by modern standards, as do some of his interpretations&quot; although added that his &quot;examination and recording of the skeletal material is more thorough than was typical previously&quot;.

A second excavation took place over the course of 1955 and 1956, overseen by Stuart Piggott and Richard J. C. Atkinson. Atkinson and Piggott&#x27;s excavations revealed the four side chambers and the various human remains that those contained.
Darvill noted that Piggott and Atkinson&#x27;s research was &quot;rapidly published&quot; and probably had &quot;the greatest impact&quot; of any Cotswold-Severn long barrow excavation in the mid-20th century.

In November 2016, Cotswold Archaeology were employed to oversee an archaeological watching brief during remedial works at the long barrow. As part of this project, the three top lights in the roof of the barrow were replaced, a membrane was added to the internal floor to improve drainage, and the eastern end of the barrow was re-profiled to add material lost to erosion.

<text>This is a list of foreign ministers () of the Habsburg monarchy, of the Austrian Empire, and of Austria-Hungary up to 1918.

== Ministers of foreign affairs ==
=== Habsburg monarchy (1720–1805) ===
From 1664/69 the Privy Conference (&quot;Geheime Konferenz&quot;), a committee of the Imperial Privy Council (&quot;Geheimer Rat&quot;), provided advice to Emperor Leopold I whereby the Austrian Court Chancellor, responsible for the Habsburg &#x27;Hereditary Lands&#x27;, served as rapporteur and thereby gained increasing influence. The Habsburg diplomatic service was re-organised, when Emperor Charles VI by resolution of 1720 declared Court Chancellor Philipp Ludwig Wenzel von Sinzendorf responsible for foreign policy issues. Upon Sinzendorf&#x27;s death in February 1742, Archduchess Maria Theresa finally separated the central Habsburg State Chancellery responsible of Foreign Affairs from the domestic Austrian Court Chancellery.

<text>Allen Mandelbaum (May 4, 1926 – October 27, 2011) was an American professor of literature and the humanities, poet, and translator from Classical Greek, Latin and Italian. His translations of classic works gained him numerous awards in Italy and the United States.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Albany, New York in 1926 and at age 13 moved with his family to Manhattan.

<doc id="588239" wikidata="Q6081651" url="?curid=588239" title="Islam Akhun">
<text>Islam Akhun was a Uyghur con-man from Khotan who forged numerous manuscripts and printed documents and sold them as ancient Silk Road manuscripts. Since the accidental discovery of the Bower Manuscript in 1889 such texts had become much sought after. The imperial powers of the time sponsored archaeological expeditions to Central Asia, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia and Japan.

==The forgeries==
It was in this competitive environment that Islam Akhun emerged. In 1895 he approached the British Consul in Kashgar, Sir George Macartney, with a number of manuscripts on paper. Some were in a script similar to Brahmi and the documents were in several different formats, many bound with copper ties. Macartney purchased the documents and sent them to India in the hope that Augustus Rudolf Hoernlé, a prominent scholar of Indo-Aryan languages, would be able to decipher them.

Unknown to Macartney, Islam Akhun&#x27;s partner, Ibrahim Mullah, was also selling similar items to the Russian consul Nikolai Petrovsky. He sent them to St. Petersburg to be translated. Ibrahim Mullah had some knowledge of Cyrillic scripts, and so he incorporated Cyrillic characters, which proved very confusing for those scholars tasked with their translation.

Hoernlé set to work trying to decipher the texts. Although he could identify some as in Brāhmī script, in his first report on these collections, he wrote of others that they were:


Islam Akhun and his colleague continued to sell items to the British and Russian consuls. By this time, they had started to produce woodblock prints as it increased production. Macartney also sent these to Hoernlé who, in 1899, published a second report. He gave an extensive account and divided them into nine different groups based on the kind of scripts in which they were written, which resembled Kharosthi, Indian and Central Asian Brahmi, Tibetan, Uighur, Persian and Chinese. But despite his detailed analysis, Hoernle was still unable to interpret them.

Doubts were soon raised about the authenticity of the manuscripts. Questions regarding the remarkably good condition of the scripts, their fortuitous discovery and bizarre script were raised, in particular by the Swedish missionary in Kashgar, Magnus Bäcklund who had also been approached by Islam Akhun. Hoernlé discussed this issue in his 1899 report but decided in favour of their authenticity, recounting Islam Akhun&#x27;s tale of the discovery of the manuscripts and documents in the ruined sites of the ancient Kingdom of Khotan in the Taklamakan Desert.

==Exposing the forgers==

It was, ironically, Hoernlé&#x27;s report that re-asserted the suspicions of Aurel Stein — renowned archaeologist and Indo-Iranian scholar — regarding the authenticity of the manuscripts. During his first Central Asia expedition in 1900 Stein visited ancient sites of Khotan, but although he excavated many manuscripts, he found nothing similar to those sold by Islam Akhun. Nor did any of the local residents have any knowledge of either the buried site or the artefacts found there. In April 1901 Stein tracked down Islam Akhun in Khotan and questioned him over the course of two days.

Initially Islam Akhun claimed innocence, insisting he had only been an agent for Macartney, and had himself purchased the documents from other parties, knowing how much the English desired them. He apparently did not remember the account of discovery he had supplied originally, and certainly did not realise it had been published. It is probable that Islam Akhun feared further punishment having already received punishment for his desertion of a British group in 1898 (see below).

Faced with his own report, Islam Akhun eventually confessed to forging the manuscripts and blockprints and described to Stein not only the factory he set up with Ibrahim Mullah, but their methodology, which involved staining the manuscripts with dye from the poplar or Toghrug, and smoking them to create an aged effect. He also mentioned that although initially he and his partner had hand-written the manuscripts and made an attempt to copy the Brahmi script from genuine manuscripts, such was the demand that they had moved onto woodblock printing.

Stein did not take further action, but ensured he captured Islam Akhun on film in a photograph that he later published in his expedition account &quot;Ancient Khotan&quot;.

Stein had the sensitive task of breaking the news to Hoernlé, who was not only his mentor, but whom he had just succeeded in the post of Principal of the Calcutta Madrasah. He first wrote to Hoernle from Kashgar:


On his return to England, Stein met with Hoernle in his house in Oxford in July 1901. Hoernle hoped that his own report could be destroyed but this was not possible as it had already been published. However, he was able to edit the second part before it went to print.

Many of the forgeries remain in the collections of the British Library and the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts, St. Petersburg.

==Other activities==
In the early summer of 1898, Islam Akhun acted as an unwilling guide for the explorer Captain Deasy on an expedition to look for ancient sites near Guma. By the third day Islam Akhun had absconded, leaving the travellers to make their own way back. On his return, he forged a note in Deasy&#x27;s handwriting to get money from Badruddin, the Aqsaqal (official who looked after the interests of the Indian traders, reporting to the Consul-General in Kashgar). As punishment, he was sentenced to wear a cangue for a month.

Stein also reports various other dubious activities, including masquerading as a British agent searching for illegal slaves in order to blackmail locals. However, after the interrogation in 1901, Islam Akhun asked Stein to let him accompany him to Europe. Stein refused, and nothing more is known of him after that.

<doc id="588240" wikidata="Q870541" url="?curid=588240" title="Lamborghini Jalpa">
<text>The Lamborghini Jalpa () is a sports car produced by the Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini from 1981 until 1988. It debuted at the 1981 Geneva Motor Show alongside the Lamborghini LM001 concept off-road vehicle. The Jalpa was the last Lamborghini to use a V8 engine until the Urus SUV in 2018.

==Overview==
The Jalpa was a development of the earlier Silhouette intended to fill a role as a more &quot;affordable&quot; Lamborghini, being much less expensive than the flagship Countach and being also designed by Bertone. Compared to the Countach, the Jalpa was much easier to drive, having better visibility and being more tractable in heavy traffic and at slow speeds, although reviewers have noted that it had heavy steering and throttle. Chief engineer at that time was Giulio Alfieri.

===Name===
The name &quot;Jalpa Kandachia&quot; came from a famous breed of fighting bulls, a tradition later followed with the Gallardo.

===Engine===

The Jalpa was fitted with a double overhead camshaft version of the V8 engine used in the Silhouette on which it was based, designated the &quot;L353&quot;. The version used in the Jalpa had a power output of at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm in European specification. The engine in the US models had a power output of . Fuel flow was managed by four twin-barrel down-draught Weber 42 DCNF carburetors.

===Performance===
Lamborghini claimed the Jalpa could accelerate from 0 to in 6.0 seconds, to in 19.1 seconds and a 1/4 mile time of 15.4 at with a top speed of , Curb weight was . The performance of the Jalpa was comparable to the entry-level Ferrari 328 which was based on the older Ferrari 308.

&quot;Classic &amp; Sports Car&quot; magazine quoted a acceleration time of 6.8 seconds and a 0–161 km/h time of 16 seconds for the Jalpa, while &quot;Car and Driver&quot; reported a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 5.8 seconds.

===Revisions and end of production===
When Lamborghini was sold in 1980, the plastic components (bumpers, air intakes and engine cover) were black, and the car carried over the rectangular taillights of the Silhouette along with a targa top body style. This was changed in 1984 when round taillights were fitted and the black plastic parts were replaced by parts in body colour. A rear wing, as with the Countach, was optional.

In 1988, after falling sales and new ownership by Chrysler, Lamborghini decided to end Jalpa production despite its being Lamborghini&#x27;s second most successful V8 car to date (after the Urraco), having sold 410 units.

<doc id="588241" wikidata="Q61671" url="?curid=588241" title="Ulrich, Duke of Württemberg">
<text>Duke Ulrich of Württemberg (8 February 14876 November 1550) succeeded his kinsman Eberhard II as Duke of Württemberg in 1498. He was declared of age in 1503. His volatile personality made him infamous, being called the &quot;Swabian Henry VIII&quot; by historians.

==Early life==

Duke Ulrich was born 8 February 1487 and his mother died in his birth. His father, Henry, Count of Württemberg, was mentally deranged, likely as a result of his three-year imprisonment by Duke Charles the Bold of Burgundy, was banished to Hohenurach Castle in the County of Urach, and his only guardian died when he was nine years of age.

Ulrich served the German king, Maximilian I, in the War of the Succession of Landshut in 1504, receiving some additions to Württemberg as a reward; he accompanied Maximilian on his unfinished journey to Rome in 1508; and he marched with the imperial army into France in 1513. Meanwhile, in Württemberg Ulrich had become very unpopular. His extravagance had led to a large accumulation of debt, and his subjects were irritated by his oppressive methods of raising money. In 1514 an uprising under the name of &quot;Poor Conrad&quot; broke out, and was only suppressed after Ulrich had made important concessions to the estates in return for financial aid. The duke&#x27;s relations with the Swabian League, moreover, were very bad, and trouble soon came from another quarter also.

In 1511 Ulrich had married Sabina, a daughter of Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria, and niece of the Emperor Maximilian. The marriage was a very unhappy one, and having formed an affection for the wife of a knight named Hans von Hutten, a kinsman of Ulrich von Hutten, the duke killed Hans in 1515 during an altercation. Hutten&#x27;s friends now joined the other elements of discontent. Fleeing from her husband, Sabina won the support of the emperor and of her brother William IV, Duke of Bavaria, and Ulrich was twice placed under the imperial ban. After the death of Maximilian in January 1519 the Swabian League interfered in the struggle, and Ulrich was driven from Württemberg, which was afterwards sold by the league to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.

==In exile==

Ulrich passed some time in Switzerland, France and Germany, occupied with brigand exploits and in service under Francis I of France; but he never lost sight of the possibility of recovering Württemberg and about 1523 he announced his conversion to the reformed faith. His opportunity came with the outbreak of the German Peasants&#x27; War. Posing as the friend of the lower orders and signing himself &quot;Ulrich the peasant&quot;, his former oppressions were forgotten and his return was anticipated with joy. Collecting men and money, mainly in France and Switzerland, he invaded Württemberg in February 1525, but the Swiss in his service were recalled owing to the defeat of Francis I of France at Pavia; the peasantry were unable to give him any serious support, and in a few weeks he was again a fugitive.

During his exile Ulrich had formed a friendship with Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse; and his restoration, undertaken by Philip, is an event of some importance in the political history of the Reformation. In 1526 Philip had declared he was anxious to restore the exiled duke, and about the same time Francis I and Zwingli had intimated their willingness to assist in a general attack upon the Habsburgs. Many difficulties, however, barred the way, and it was 1534 before Philip was prepared to strike.

==Restoration==
In January of that year Francis I had definitely promised assistance; the Swabian League had just been dissolved; and, after a manifesto had been issued by Ulrich and Philip justifying the proposed undertaking, Württemberg was invaded in April 1534. Charles V and his brother, King Ferdinand I, could send but little assistance to their lieutenants, and on the 13 May the troops of the Habsburgs were completely defeated at the Battle of Lauffen. In a few weeks Ulrich was restored, and in June 1534 a treaty was negotiated at Kaaden by which he was recognized as duke by Ferdinand, but was to hold Württemberg under Austrian suzerainty. After some hesitation Ulrich yielded to the solicitations of Philip, and signed the treaty in February 1535.
The duke now lost no time in pressing on the teaching of the reformed doctrines of Luther and Zwingli. Many convents and monasteries were destroyed, and extensive seizures of church property formed a welcome addition to his impoverished exchequer (this act was precisely simultaneous with the similar Dissolution of the Monasteries undertaken by King Henry VIII of England). Taxation, however, was so heavy that he soon lost his temporary popularity. In April 1536 he joined the Schmalkaldic League, though he did not assent to some of the schemes of Philip of Hesse for attacking Charles V. In 1546 his troops fought against the Emperor during the Schmalkaldic War, but with disastrous results for Württemberg. The duchy was quickly overrun, and the duke compelled to agree to the Treaty of Heilbronn in January 1547. By this treaty Charles, ignoring the desire of Ferdinand to depose Ulrich again, allowed him to retain his duchy, but stipulated that he should pay a large sum of money, surrender certain fortresses, and appear as a suppliant before the Emperor at Ulm. Having submitted under compulsion to the Augsburg Interim in May 1548, Ulrich died on 6 November 1550 at Tübingen, where he was buried. He left a son, Christopher (1515–1568), who succeeded him.

<text>The minister-president of Austria was the head of government of the Austrian Empire from 1848, when the office was created in the course of the March Revolution. Previously, executive power rested with an Austrian State Council, headed by the emperor himself, from 1821 under the chairmanship of State Chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich. The office of minister-president was not refilled from 1852, when Emperor Franz Joseph resumed control of the government affairs, and was replaced by a coordinating chairman of the Austrian Minister&#x27;s Conference.

According to the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, executive powers were divided between the emperor-king, the minister of the Imperial and Royal House and of Foreign Affairs as chairman of the k. u. k. Ministers&#x27; Council for Common Affairs, and the minister-presidents of the Cisleithanian (Austrian) and Hungarian halves of the Empire. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in November 1918, the head of government in the Austrian Republic since 1920 has been the federal chancellor.

<doc id="588244" wikidata="Q1771104" url="?curid=588244" title="Guardo">
<text>Guardo is a town and municipality situated in the Montaña Palentina region in the far north of the province of Palencia, in the autonomous community of Castile and León, Spain. As of 2023, the municipality had 5653 residents, making it the third most populated settlement in the province.

== History ==

=== Origins and early period ===
Little is known about the pre-medieval history of Guardo. The name of one of the town&#x27;s suburbs, Valdecastro, suggests the existence of a some kind of Celtic fort, although no historical sources can confirm this. The origin of the town&#x27;s name has been extensively discussed. According to Quirino Fernández, it could come from the Latin &#x27;Bucca ad ardum&#x27; or &#x27;Mouth of the Heights&#x27;, which could be translated as a pass of difficult access, whereas Julio Caro Baroja links it to the Celtic word &#x27;ward&#x27;, or Land of Storms.

Guardo is first mentioned in the 10th century as &#x27;Buardo&#x27; or &#x27;Boardo&#x27;, as a village linked to the nearby San Román de Entrepeñas Monastery in a document about property transfer. Forming part of the Counts of Saldañas&#x27; estate, its castle, which was strategically situated on a hill above the banks of the Carrión river, was used to monitor the possible Muslim raids and to control the border with the Kingdom of León and the County of Castile.

In the 13th century, King Alfonso VII ordered for the castle at Guardo to be &quot;maintained and for its occupiers to be perpetually garrisoned&quot;. The fortress comprised a tower to monitor local travel, a chapel dedicated to Nuestra Señora del Castillo and a necropolis. The castle had completely disappeared by the 19th century, when its stone was used for the construction of the train line between Bilbao and La Robla.

From 1636 until 1801, Guardo belonged to the province of Toro, before being incorporated into Palencia, to which it still belongs today. For much of its early history, the village relied on rearing cattle and agriculture and remained a small settlement up until the modern era.

=== Industrial development and decline ===
Guardo&#x27;s industrial development paralleled the discovery of coal in the region towards the end of the 19th century, as well as the construction of the La Robla to Bilbao narrow gauge railway, which transported said coal to the seaports of Santander and Bilbao, as well as to the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya in the Basque Country. With the onset of mining in the area at the start of the 20th century and the influx of people from other regions seeking employment in coal extraction, the character of the town underwent a radical change as the old urban centre was surrounded by new housing. The town&#x27;s population would increasingly increase until it reached a high point in the 1960s, when it was more than double the present population.

Alongside the town of Barruelo de Santullán to the northeast, Guardo became one of the main areas of conflict in the Montaña Palentina during the failed Revolution of October 1934. The rebels assaulted the Civil Guard&#x27;s barracks, killing a gendarme and setting fire to the building. The conflict ended with the arrival of the army and the fleeing of the revolutionaries into the nearby hills, before they eventually surrendered. After this event, as well as during the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalist uprising encountered no opposition in the region, which ensured that armed resistance to the Francoist state remained minimal in the decade following the conflict.

By the 1980s, with Spain&#x27;s accession to the European Economic Community and the decline of coal mining due to both its economic infeasibility and European environmental objectives, the whole region entered a profound economic crisis aggravated by the scarcity of services (such as a hospital and law courts) and a sustained period of alarming depopulation, the latter of which remains an issue in much of rural Spain to the present day.

== Physical geography ==

The town is situated on the banks of the Carrión river on the southern slopes of the Sierra del Brezo, a mountain range that separates the Cantabrian Mountains from the Meseta Central.

Guardo&#x27;s average elevation is 1123 metres above sea level. The majority of the town is modern, mainly constructed during the first half of the 20th century, although there is a small historic section on a hill to the east. The centre of the town is on the left bank of the river. The right bank contains the railway and industrial facilities, many of which are no longer in operation.

The municipality of Guardo, in addition to the titular town, also comprises the hamlets of Muñeca, Intorcisa and San Pedro de Cansoles.

Guardo itself is 91 km away from Palencia, the provincial capital, 145 km from Valladolid, 137 km from Burgos and 85 km from León.

It is the capital of the comarca of Alto Carrión and is by the far the largest settlement in this mountainous region of northern Castille and Leon.

The elevation of the municipality oscillates between 1836 metres on the summit of Peña Mayor de Guardo and approximately 1100 metres on the banks of the Carrión as it flows towards the village of Mantinos to the south.

Guardo is situated on the Camino Olvidado a Santiago, or the &#x27;Forgotten Way&#x27; of St James, a route of the Camino de Santiago that was used by the very first pilgrims travelling to Santiago de Compostela in Galicia.

== Climate ==

Guardo has a fresh Mediterranean climate (type Csb), close to the boundary with a type Cfb oceanic climate. The following table indicates the climatic averages for the locality:
== Culture ==

=== Festivals ===

* Week of the 13 June: San Antonio de Padua (the annual village festival)
* 24 June: San Juan
* 10 July: Santa Marta
* 16 July: Procession of El Carmen
* 4 December: Santa Bárbara (the patron saint of miners)

== Landmarks ==
=== Iglesia de San Juan Bautista (St John the Baptist Church) ===
Situated on a hill in the east of town in a neighbourhood known as &quot;El Otero&quot; (The Hill). It was built in the 14th century in a florid Gothic style. Inside there is a Romanesque font dating back to the 18th century.

Palacio del Arzobispo Bullón (Archbishop Bullón&#x27;s Palace)

This palace is located in the upper town and is well-known for its splendid Barroque façade dating back to the 18th century. It was declared a &quot;Bien de interés cultural&quot; and was restored in 2022.

=== Monumento al Minero (Monument to the Miner) ===
The Monument to the Miner is a 4-metre high bronze figure depicting various coal-mining imagery suspended on a concrete plinth above a pool and fountains. The monument was inaugurated in July 1975 and was completed by the sculptor Jacinto Higueras Cátedra. It is a homage to the figure of the miner and is considered the town&#x27;s most emblematic monument, often serving as a meeting place for many Guardenses.

=== Ayuntamiento de Guardo (Town Hall) ===
In November 2018, 11 years after the demolition of the old town hall, Guardo&#x27;s new administrative building was inaugurated and is also home to a police station and an auditorium with capacity for 400 people.

Parque Fuentes Carrionas (&#x27;Source of the Carrión&#x27; Park)

A small park situated west of the town centre on the banks of the Carrión river. It takes its name from Fuentes Carrionas, a glacial lake that constitutes the traditional source of this river.

== Economy ==

The town&#x27;s main economic activity was coal mining, an industry that commenced several decades after the heavy mining operations in the neighbouring Asturias and León provinces since the coal in Guardo was found deeper into the ground and one had to await for the appropriate technological advances.

In 1942 an important chemical industrial plant owned by Unión Explosivos Río Tinto was constructed in the town and was in operation for over four decades. Initially, the factory comprised numerous buildings, which over time were demolished to the small number still standing today. This factory closed for good in May 2008, with its last owner being the US multinational company Celanese.

== Notable people ==

* Ana José Cancio (1960-), Journalist at TVE and RNE
* Francisco Díaz Santos Bullón (1687-1764), priest and statesman: Archbishop of Burgos, Bishop of both Sigüenza and Barcelona and Governor of the Consejo de Castilla
* Jesús Landáburu (1955-), ex-footballer for Real Valladolid, Rayo Vallecano, FC Barcelona and Atlético Madrid who also briefly played for the Spanish national team
* Claudio Prieto (1934-2015), Classical composer born in Muñeca. The main site of Guardo&#x27;s secondary school, IES Guardo, was formerly named after him.

<doc id="588248" wikidata="Q7275131" url="?curid=588248" title="Aldergrove Flying Station">
<text>Aldergrove Flying Station, also known previously as JHC FS Aldergrove, is a British military base located south of Antrim, Northern Ireland and northwest of Belfast, and adjoins Belfast International Airport. It is sometimes referred to simply as Aldergrove which is the name of a nearby hamlet. 

The military flying units share Aldergrove&#x27;s runways with Belfast International Airport, but have their own separate facilities and helipad.

The site was formerly RAF Aldergrove, a Royal Air Force station which was in operation between 1918 and 2009.

== History ==
=== Interwar period ===
RAF Aldergrove first opened in 1918 but was not designated as an operational RAF station until 1925.

Various squadrons were posted here during this time:
* A detachment of No. 4 Squadron RAF between 30 April 1920 and 26 September 1922 again with the Bristol F2B.

====Royal Air Force operations====

No. 72 Squadron operated Westland Wessex HC.2 helicopters from Aldergrove from 12 November 1981 until its disbandment in 2002.

No. 230 Squadron RAF was re-deployed from Germany to RAF Aldergrove in 1992, where it operated Westland Puma HC.1 helicopters until its relocation to RAF Benson in November 2009.

No. 18 Squadron RAF also operated detachments of Boeing Chinook during the late 80s in support of the British Army in Northern Ireland.

The following units were here at some point:
==== Army Air Corps operations ====

The Army Air Corps also operated Westland Lynx and Westland Gazelle helicopters as well as de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver aircraft in its joint operations with the RAF&#x27;s Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (Northern Ireland); the Beaver was replaced by the Britten-Norman Islander late in 1988.

The 17/21st Lancers Air Squadron based at RAF Aldergrove from 1969 to 1971 operating with Sioux Helicopters and a Fixed Wing Beaver aircraft.

During 1991, No. 655 Squadron AAC moved from RAF Ballykelly to Aldergrove with the Westland Lynx AH Mk 7 helicopter.

On 1 October 1993, the Northern Ireland Regiment Army Air Corps was retitled 5 Regiment Army Air Corps.

On 4 August 2008, 651 Squadron Army Air Corps moved back to Northern Ireland from RAF Odiham almost 50 years after its first deployment there.

==== Post Operation BANNER ====
During the latter years of Operation BANNER, 5 Regiment Army Air Corps and 230 Squadron RAF came under the control of the Joint Helicopter Command (JHC) and formed the Joint Helicopter Force Northern Ireland (JHF(NI)). As the site was no longer a major RAF establishment it became Joint Helicopter Command Flying Station Aldergrove.

After the end of Operation BANNER, a number of other Army units were relocated to Aldergrove. The base was no longer therefore administered by the JHC and on 1 Apr 2013 became Aldergrove Flying Station under command of 38 (Irish) Brigade.

5 Regiment Army Air Corps continued to operate at Aldergrove, providing Gazelle, Defender and Islander aircraft in support of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and military units for Operation Helvetic, and for other operations abroad.

Due to the closure of RAF Machrihanish, the base is now used for University Air Squadron and Air Training Corps cadets as a training camp, where cadets from Scotland and Northern Ireland gather for flying experiences, fieldcraft, shooting, first aid and other activities.

In 2003, Air Force One arrived at the airport in support of U.S. presidential visits to Northern Ireland.

Aldergrove officially ceased to be an RAF Station on 20 September 2009 when, after the annual Battle of Britain parade, the RAF ensign was lowered for the last time and the Joint Helicopter Command flag was hoisted in its place.

No. 651 Squadron&#x27;s Britten-Norman Islander and Defender aircraft were retired from service in June 2021. In August 2021, No. 651 Squadron was transferred to the command of 1 Regiment, AAC.

No. 665 Squadron was the final Army Air Corps squadron based at Aldergrove. It formerly operated the Gazelle helicopter in a manned surveillance role, until it was retired from service in October 2023. By November 2024, the squadron had moved to Middle Wallop Flying Station.

<doc id="588250" wikidata="Q757554" url="?curid=588250" title="Nuclear submarine">
<text>A nuclear submarine is a submarine powered by a nuclear reactor, but not necessarily nuclear-armed. In the US classification, nuclear-powered submarines are designated as SSxN, where the SS denotes submarine, x=G means that the submarine is equipped with guided missiles (usually cruise missiles), x=B means that the submarine is equipped with ballistic missiles (usually intercontinental) and the N means that the submarine is nuclear-powered. SSN refers to nuclear-powered attack submarines, which do not carry missiles.

Nuclear submarines have considerable performance advantages over &quot;conventional&quot; (typically diesel-electric) submarines. Nuclear propulsion, being completely independent of air, frees the submarine from the need to surface frequently, as is necessary for conventional submarines. The large amount of power generated by a nuclear reactor allows nuclear submarines to operate at high speed for long periods, and the long interval between refuelings grants a virtually unlimited range, making the only limits on voyage times factors such as the need to restock food or other consumables. Thus nuclear propulsion solves the problem of limited mission duration that all electric (battery or fuel cell powered) submarines face.

The high cost of nuclear technology means that relatively few of the world&#x27;s military powers have fielded nuclear submarines. Radiation incidents have occurred within the Soviet submarines, including serious nuclear and radiation accidents, but American naval reactors starting with the S1W and iterations of designs have operated without incident since USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; (SSN-571) launched in 1954.

==History==

The idea for a nuclear-powered submarine was first proposed in the United States Navy by the Naval Research Laboratory&#x27;s physicist Ross Gunn in 1939. The Royal Navy began researching designs for nuclear propulsion plants in 1946.

Construction of the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine was made possible by the successful development of a nuclear propulsion plant by a group of scientists and engineers in the United States at the Naval Reactors Branch of the Bureau of Ships and the Atomic Energy Commission. In July 1951, the U.S. Congress authorized construction of the first nuclear-powered submarine, &quot;Nautilus&quot;, under the leadership of Captain Hyman G. Rickover, USN (sharing a name with Captain Nemo&#x27;s fictional submarine in Jules Verne&#x27;s 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;, the first demonstrably practical submarine &quot;Nautilus&quot;, and another that served with distinction in World War II).

The Westinghouse Corporation was assigned to build its reactor. After the submarine was completed at the Electric Boat Company, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower broke the traditional bottle of champagne on &quot;Nautilus&quot;″ bow, and the submarine was commissioned , on 30 September 1954. On 17 January 1955, she departed Groton, Connecticut, to begin sea trials. The submarine was long and cost about $55 million. Recognizing the utility of such vessels, the British Admiralty formed plans to build nuclear-powered submarines.

The Soviet Union soon followed the United States in developing nuclear-powered submarines in the 1950s. Stimulated by the U.S. development of &quot;Nautilus&quot;, Soviets began work on nuclear propulsion reactors in the early 1950s at the Institute of Physics and Power Engineering, in Obninsk, under Anatoliy P. Alexandrov, later to become head of the Kurchatov Institute. In 1956, the first Soviet propulsion reactor designed by his team began operational testing. Meanwhile, a design team under Vladimir N. Peregudov worked on the vessel that would house the reactor. After overcoming many obstacles, including steam generation problems, radiation leaks, and other difficulties, the first nuclear submarine based on these combined efforts, K-3 &quot;Leninskiy Komsomol&quot; of the Project 627 &quot;Kit&quot; class, called a by NATO, entered service in the Soviet Navy in 1958.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine was fitted with an American S5W reactor, provided to Britain under the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. The hull and combat systems of &quot;Dreadnought&quot; were of British design and construction, although the hull form and construction practices were influenced by access to American designs. During &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s construction, Rolls-Royce, in collaboration with the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority at the Admiralty Research Station, HMS &quot;Vulcan&quot;, at Dounreay, developed a completely new British nuclear propulsion system. In 1960, the UK&#x27;s second nuclear-powered submarine was ordered from Vickers Armstrong and, fitted with Rolls-Royce&#x27;s PWR1 nuclear plant, was the first all-British nuclear submarine. Further technology transfers from the United States made Rolls-Royce entirely self-sufficient in reactor design in exchange for a &quot;considerable amount&quot; of information regarding submarine design and quietening techniques transferred from the United Kingdom to the United States. The rafting system for the &quot;Valiant&quot; class provided the Royal Navy with an advantage in submarine silencing that the United States Navy did not introduce until considerably later.

Nuclear power proved ideal for the propulsion of strategic ballistic missile submarines (SSB), greatly improving their ability to remain submerged and undetected. The world&#x27;s first operational nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) was with 16 Polaris A-1 missiles, which conducted the first SSBN deterrent patrol November 1960 – January 1961. The Soviets already had several SSBs of the Project 629 (Golf class) and were only a year behind the US with their first SSBN, ill-fated &quot;K-19&quot; of Project 658 (Hotel class), commissioned in November 1960. However, this class carried the same three-missile armament as the Golfs. The first Soviet SSBN with 16 missiles was the Project 667A (Yankee class), the first of which entered service in 1967, by which time the US had commissioned 41 SSBNs, nicknamed the &quot;41 for Freedom&quot;.

At the height of the Cold War, approximately five to ten nuclear submarines were being commissioned yearly from the four Soviet submarine yards (Sevmash in Severodvinsk, Admiralteyskiye Verfi in St. Petersburg, Krasnoye Sormovo in Nizhny Novgorod, and Amurskiy Zavod in Komsomolsk-on-Amur). From the late 1950s through the end of 1997, the Soviet Union, and later Russia, built a total of 245 nuclear submarines, more than all other nations combined.

Today, six countries deploy some form of nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, and India. Several other countries including Brazil and Australia have ongoing projects in various phases to build nuclear-powered submarines.

In the United Kingdom, all former and current nuclear submarines of the British Royal Navy (with the exception of three: , and ) have been constructed in Barrow-in-Furness (at BAE Systems Submarine Solutions or its predecessor VSEL) where construction of nuclear submarines continues. &quot;Conqueror&quot; the only nuclear-powered submarine in the world ever to have engaged an enemy ship with torpedoes, sinking the cruiser with two Mark 8 torpedoes during the 1982 Falklands War.

==Technology==
The main difference between conventional submarines and nuclear submarines is the power generation system. Nuclear submarines employ nuclear reactors for this task. They either generate electricity that powers electric motors connected to the propeller shaft or rely on the reactor&#x27;s heat to produce steam that drives steam turbines (cf. nuclear marine propulsion). Reactors used in submarines typically use highly enriched fuel (often greater than 20%) to enable them to deliver a large amount of power from a smaller reactor and operate longer between refuelings – which are difficult due to the reactor&#x27;s position within the submarine&#x27;s pressure hull. Also, virtually all nuclear reactors employed in submarines so far have been of the pressurized light-water reactor type.

The nuclear reactor also supplies power to the submarine&#x27;s other subsystems, such as for maintenance of air quality, fresh water production by distilling salt water from the ocean, temperature regulation, etc. All naval nuclear reactors currently in use are operated with diesel generators as a backup power system. These engines are able to provide emergency electrical power for reactor decay heat removal, as well as enough electric power to supply an emergency propulsion mechanism. Submarines may carry nuclear fuel for up to 30 years of operation. The only resource that limits the time underwater is the food supply for the crew and maintenance of the vessel.

The stealth technology weakness of nuclear submarines is the need to cool the reactor even when the submarine is not moving; about 70% of the reactor output heat is dissipated into the sea water. This leaves a &quot;thermal wake&quot;, a plume of warm water of lower density which ascends to the sea surface and creates a &quot;thermal scar&quot; that is observable by thermal imaging systems, e.g., FLIR. Another problem is that the reactor is always running, creating steam noise, which can be heard on sonar, and the reactor pump (used to circulate reactor coolant), also creates noise, as opposed to a conventional submarine, which can move about on almost silent electric motors.

==Decommissioning==
The useful lifetime of a nuclear submarine is estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years, after this period the submarine will face fatigue and corrosion of components, obsolescence and escalating operating costs. The decommissioning of these submarines is a long process; some are held in reserve or mothballed for some time and eventually scrapped, others are disposed of immediately. Countries operating nuclear submarines have different strategies when it comes to decommissioning nuclear submarines. Nonetheless, the effective disposal of nuclear submarines is costly, in 2004 it was estimated to cost around 4 billion dollars.

===Methods===
Generally there are two options when it comes to decommissioning nuclear submarines. The first option is to defuel the nuclear reactor and remove the material and components that contain radioactivity, after which the hull section containing the nuclear reactor will then be cut out of the submarine and transported to a disposal site for low-level radioactive waste and get buried according to waste procedures. The second option is to defuel the nuclear reactor, disassemble the submarine propulsion plant, install vents in the nonreactor compartments and fill the reactor compartment. After sealing the submarine it can then be towed to a designated deep-sea disposal site, be flooded and settle intact on the sea floor. This last option has been considered by some navies and countries in the past. However, while sea disposal is cheaper than land disposal the uncertainty regarding regulations and international law, such as the London Dumping Convention and the Law of the Sea Convention, has stopped them from proceeding with this option.

==Accidents==
===Reactor accidents===
Some of the most serious nuclear and radiation accidents by death toll in the world have involved nuclear submarine mishaps. To date, all of these were units of the former Soviet Union. Reactor accidents that resulted in core damage and release of radioactivity from nuclear-powered submarines include:
* &quot;K-8&quot;, 1960: suffered a loss-of-coolant accident; substantial radioactivity released.
* &quot;K-14&quot;, 1961: the reactor compartment was replaced due to unspecified &quot;breakdown of reactor protection systems&quot;.
* &quot;K-19&quot;, 1961: suffered a loss-of-coolant accident resulting in 8 deaths and more than 30 other people being over-exposed to radiation. The events on board the submarine are dramatized by the film &quot;K-19: The Widowmaker&quot;.
* &quot;K-11&quot;, 1965: both reactors were damaged during refueling while lifting the reactor vessel heads; reactor compartments scuttled off the east coast of Novaya Zemlya in the Kara Sea in 1966.
* &quot;K-27&quot;, 1968: experienced reactor core damage to one of its liquid metal (lead-bismuth) cooled VT-1 reactors, resulting in 9 fatalities and 83 other injuries; scuttled in the Kara Sea in 1982.
* &quot;K-140&quot;, 1968: the reactor was damaged following an uncontrolled, automatic increase in power during shipyard work.
* &quot;K-429&quot;, 1970: an uncontrolled start-up of the ship&#x27;s reactor led to a fire and the release of radioactivity
* &quot;K-116&quot;, 1970: suffered a loss-of-coolant accident in the port reactor; substantial radioactivity released.
* &quot;K-64&quot;, 1972: the first Alfa-class liquid-metal cooled reactor failed; reactor compartment scrapped.
* &quot;K-222&quot;, 1980: the Papa-class submarine had a reactor accident during maintenance in the shipyard while the ship&#x27;s naval crew had left for lunch.
* &quot;K-123&quot;, 1982: the Alfa-class submarine reactor core damaged by liquid-metal coolant leak; the sub was forced out of commission for eight years.
* &quot;K-431&quot;, 1985: a reactor accident while refueling resulted in 10 fatalities and 49 other people suffered radiation injuries.
* &quot;K-219&quot;, 1986: suffered an explosion and fire in a missile tube, eventually leading to a reactor accident; a 20-year-old enlisted seaman, Sergei Preminin, sacrificed his life to secure one of the onboard reactors. The submarine sank three days later.
* &quot;K-192&quot;, 1989 (reclassified from &quot;K-131&quot;): suffered a loss-of-coolant accident due to a break in the starboard reactor loop.

===Other major accidents and sinkings===
* , 1963: was lost during deep diving tests with 129 crew and shipyard personnel on board; later investigation concluded that failure of a brazed pipe joint and ice formation in the ballast blow valves prevented surfacing. The accident motivated a number of safety changes to the U.S. fleet. &quot;Thresher&quot; was the first of only two submarines to exceed 100 onboard deaths, joined by the Russian Kursk&#x27;s 118 lost in 2000.
* &quot;K-3&quot;, 1967: the first Soviet nuclear submarine experienced a fire associated with the hydraulic system, killing 39 sailors.
* , 1968: was lost at sea, evidently due to implosion upon sinking. What caused &quot;Scorpion&quot; to descend to her crush depth is unknown.
* , 1969: sank while pier-side in shipyard due to improper ballasting. The submarine was eventually completed and commissioned.
* &quot;K-8&quot;, 1970: a fire and a towing accident resulted in the sub sinking and the loss of all 52 crewmen remaining aboard.
* &quot;K-56&quot;, 1973: a collision with another Soviet vessel led to flooding of the battery well and many crew deaths due to chlorine gas.
* &quot;K-429&quot;, 1983: the sub sank to the ocean bottom due to flooding from improper rig-for-dive and shipyard errors but was later recovered; 16 crewmen were killed.
* &quot;K-278 Komsomolets&quot;, 1989: the Soviet submarine sank in Barents Sea due to a fire.
* &quot;K-141 Kursk&quot;, 2000: lost at sea with all 118 crewmen on board; the generally accepted theory is that a leak of hydrogen peroxide in the forward torpedo room led to the detonation of a torpedo warhead, which in turn triggered the explosion of half a dozen other warheads about two minutes later.
* &quot;Ehime Maru&quot; and &quot;USS Greeneville&quot;, 2001: the American submarine surfaced underneath the Japanese training vessel. Nine Japanese crewmembers, students, and teachers were killed when their ship sank as a result of the collision.
* &quot;K-159&quot;, 2003: sank in the Barents Sea while being towed to be scrapped, killing nine crewmen.
* , 2005: collided with a seamount in the Pacific Ocean. A crew member was killed and 23 others were injured.
* , 2012: the submarine&#x27;s forward compartment was destroyed by an arsonist-set fire while in shipyard, causing damage with an estimated $700 million in repair costs. While repairs were initially planned upon, due to budget cuts the boat was subsequently scrapped.
==New technological developments==
It has been reported that the Russian Navy plans to introduce in 2027 a nuclear-powered nuclear-armed unmanned underwater vehicle named Poseidon. Limited data available in open literature suggests that it uses a small (mostly likely enriched uranium-fueled) reactor, and it is capable or travelling at a fairly high speed of 130 km/h, although for most of its mission duration it is expected to travel much slower to avoid acoustic detection. It is expected to be launched from specially-designed Belgorod class submarines, and to hit large coastal cities as a second strike weapon. (Although the initial tests of Poseidon were conducted with a diesel-electric submarine Sarov). The main advantage of using unmanned underwater vehicles instead of SSBNs as a second strike weapon is to prevent the loss of lives of the SSBN crew. If the second strike nuclear missiles are launched directly from an SSBN, the location of the submarine is revealed and it can be quickly destroyed in a third strike by a cruise or ballistic missile, launched from another submarine, from a surface ship or from land. When an UUV delivers a nuclear charge, the location of the mothership remains unknown, and the ship is likely to survive the 3rd strike. No other country is known to be developing similar weapons in 2024.

In the meantime, the United States is developing Columbia-class submarines. It is expected to have 16 missile tubes and to have its first patrol mission in 2031. Twelve submarines of this class, with a service life of ca. 42 years, are expected to be commissioned.

<text>Johannes Janssen (Xanten, 10 April 1829 – Frankfurt-am-Main, 24 December 1891) was a German Catholic priest and historian. He wrote an eight volume &quot;History of the German People&quot;, quoting many original sources.

==Life==

After graduating from the &quot;Rektoratsschule&quot; in Xanten (today&#x27;s &quot;Stiftsgymnasium&quot;), he was educated at the universities of Münster, Leuven, Bonn and Berlin. It was while he was at the University of Louvain that be resolved to make the study of history his principal work. He became a teacher of history at the Gymnasium in Frankfurt-am-Main, a position he held up to the time of his death. Historian Ludwig von Pastor was one of his students.

Janssen had long been interested in entering the priesthood, but the delicate state of his health postponed that for some time. He was ordained priest at Limburg in March 1860. Not satisfied with attending to the ordinary duties of the classroom, Janssen devoted his spare time to historical research, the results of which were embodied in many learned volumes. In 1864-65 he spent several months in Rome, where he consulted the archives of the Vatican on matters relating to the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

He became a member of the Prussian House of Deputies in 1875, joined the Centre party, and spent much time in Berlin. In 1880 was made domestic prelate to the pope and apostolic pronotary. He died at Frankfurt. Janssen was a stout champion of the Ultramontane party in the Roman Catholic Church. Janssen died in Frankfurt on Christmas Eve 1891. Wilhelm II, German Emperor sent a wreath for the coffin. An asylum for the poor and abandoned children of Frankfort, erected in 1894 in the town of Oberursel, owed its existence largely to his efforts.

==Works==
His first work was a Latin biography of Abbot Wibald, which appeared in a revised form in German (1854). In 1856 he published a volume of historical documents relating to the Diocese of Munster, &quot;Die Geschichtsquellen des Bisthums Münster&quot;, 3 vols. In the essay &quot;Zur Genesis der ersten Theilung Polens&quot; (1865) he explained the circumstances under which the former Kingdom of Poland was robbed of part of its dominions by neighbouring countries.

He wrote a biography in three volumes in 1868 of Johann Friedrich Böhmer, a man whom he considered as his teacher and guide. In 1876-77 appeared a two volume biography of the writer and poet Count Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg.
His great work is his &quot;Geschichte des deutschen Volkes seit dem Ausgang des Mittelalters&quot; (8 vols., Freiburg, 1878–1894), first suggested by Böhmer in 1853. He argues against Luther, Zwingli and the other Protestant reformers, and claimed that Protestantism was responsible for the general unrest in Germany during the 16th and 17th centuries. The author&#x27;s conclusions led to some controversy, and Janssen wrote &quot;An meine Kritiker&quot; (Freiburg, 1882) and &quot;Ein zweites Wort an meine Kritiker&quot; (Freiburg, 1883) in reply to the &quot;Janssens Geschichte des deutschen Volkes&quot; (Munich, 1883) of Max Lenz, and other criticisms. A French historian quoted in the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot; said, &quot;To get impatient with Janssen is easy: to prove that he is wrong, just the reverse.&quot;

The &quot;Geschichte&quot;, which has passed through numerous editions, has been continued and improved by Ludwig Pastor, and the greater part of it has been translated into English by M. A. Mitchell and A. M. Christie (London, 1896, fol.). Of his other works perhaps the most important are: the editing of &quot;Frankfurts Reichskorrespondenz, 1376–1519&quot; (Freiburg, 1863–1872); and of the &quot;Leben, Briefe und kleinere Schriften&quot; of his friend JF Böhmer (Leipzig, 1868); a monograph, &quot;Schiller als Historiker&quot; (Freiburg, 1863); and &quot;Zeit- und Lebensbilder&quot; (Freiburg, 1875).

<doc id="588255" wikidata="Q2634570" url="?curid=588255" title="Green gross domestic product">
<text>The green gross domestic product (green GDP or GGDP) is an index of economic growth with the environmental consequences of that growth factored into a country&#x27;s conventional GDP. Green GDP monetizes the loss of biodiversity, and accounts for costs caused by climate change. Some environmental experts prefer physical indicators (such as &quot;waste per capita&quot; or &quot;carbon dioxide emissions per year&quot;), which may be aggregated to indices such as the &quot;Sustainable Development Index&quot;.

==Calculation==

=== Formula ===
The environmental and related social costs to develop the economy are taken into consideration when calculating the green GDP, which can be expressed as:

Green GDP = GDP − Environmental Costs − Social Costs

where the environmental cost typically qualifies:

* Depletion value of natural resources, e.g. oil, coal, natural gas, wood, and metals;
* Degradation cost of ecological environment, e.g. underground water pollution, topsoil erosion, and extinction of wildlife;
* Restoration cost of natural resources, e.g. waste recycling, wetland restoration, and afforestation;

and the social costs typically include:

* Poverty caused by degradation of environment, e.g. shortage of natural resources after exploitation;
* Extra healthcare expenditure coming with the degradation of ecological environment;

Above calculations can also be applied to net domestic product (NDP), which deducts the depreciation of produced capital from GDP.

=== Valuation methodology ===
Since the indicators of environment are generally expressed in national accounts, the conversion of the resource activity into a monetary value is necessary. A common procedure to evaluate, proposed by United Nations in its System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting handbook, applies following steps:

If current values of resources are non-existent or non-explicit, the next option is to value the resource based upon the present value of expected net returns from future commercial use. That is, the sum of present values for future expected income minus expected future expenditures (the cash flow CF), for each future time point (t), is termed the net present value (NPV).

==Rationale==

The motivation for creating a green GDP originates from the inherent limitations of GDP as an indicator of economic performance and social progress. GDP assesses gross output alone, without identifying the wealth and assets that underlie output. GDP does not account for significant or permanent depletion, or replenishment, of these assets. Ultimately, GDP has no capacity to identify whether the level of income generated in a country is sustainable. Richard Stone, one of the creators of the original GDP index, suggested that, while &quot;the three pillars on which an analysis of society ought to rest are studies of economic, socio-demographic, and environmental phenomenon&quot;, he had done little work in the area of environmental issues.

Natural capital is poorly represented in GDP. Resources are not adequately considered as economic assets. Relative to their costs, companies and policymakers also do not give sufficient weight to the future benefits generated by restorative or protective environmental projects. As well, the important positive externalities that arise from forests, wetlands, and agriculture are unaccounted for, or otherwise hidden, because of practical difficulties around measuring and pricing these assets. Similarly, the impact that the depletion of natural resources or increases in pollution can and do have on the future productive capacity of a nation are unaccounted for in traditional GDP estimates.

The need for a more comprehensive macroeconomic indicator is consistent with the conception of sustainable development as a desirable phenomenon. GDP is mistakenly appropriated as a primary indicator of well-being, and as a result, it is used heavily in the analysis of political and economic policy. Green GDP would arguably be a more accurate indicator or measure of societal well-being. Therefore, the integration of environmental statistics into national accounts, and by extension, the generation of a green GDP figure, would improve countries&#x27; abilities to manage their economies and resources.

==History==
Many economists, scientists, and other scholars have theorized about adjusting macroeconomic indicators to account for environmental change. The idea was developed early on through the work of Nordhaus and Tobin (1972), Ahmad et al. (1989), Repetto et al. (1989), and Hartwick (1990).

In 1972, William Nordhaus and James Tobin introduced the first model to measure the annual real consumption of households, called the Measure of Economic Welfare (MEW). MEW adjusts GDP to include the value of leisure time, unpaid work, and environmental damages. They also defined a sustainable MEW (MEW-S) value, and their work was the precursor to more sophisticated measures of sustainable development.

Repetto further explored the impact that the failure of resource-based economies to account for the depreciation of their natural capital could have, especially by distorting evaluations of macroeconomic relationships and performance. He and his colleagues developed the concept of depreciation accounting, which factors environmental depreciation into &quot;aggregate measures of economic performance&quot;.

In their seminal report, &quot;Economic Accounting for Sustainable Development&quot;, Yusuf Ahmad, Salah El Serafy, and Ernst Lutz compiled papers from several UNEP-World Bank sponsored workshops, convened after 1983, on how to develop environmental accounting as a public policy tool. The central theme of all of the authors&#x27; arguments is that the system of national accounts (SNA), as it traditionally calculates income, omits important aspects of economic development that ought to be included. One important disagreement on environmentally adjusted indicators is presented by Anne Harrison and Salah El Serafy, in their respective chapters. Harrison argues that appropriate adjustments ought to be made within the existing SNA framework, while El Serafy suggests a redefinition of what constitutes intermediate and final demand. In his view, the SNA should not consider the sale of natural capital as generating value added, while at least part of the income generated from this sale should be excluded from GDP and net product. This would effectively allow GDP to continue to be used extensively.

In &quot;Natural Resources, National Accounting and Economic Depreciation&quot;, John Hartwick presents an accounting methodology to find NNP, inclusive of the depletion of natural resource stock, by representing the use of natural resources as &quot;economic depreciation magnitudes&quot;.

This method of accounting, which makes adjustments to the existing national account indicators, found traction in the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA), published by the United Nations as an appendix to the 1993 SNA. The report offered five approaches, or versions, to developing environmental accounts. Over the years, the SEEA has been expanded and revised in view of the increased sophistication of accounting methodologies and technology. This revision will be explored in greater detail in the &quot;Global Initiatives&quot; section. Ultimately, the importance of the SEEA with respect to the green GDP is that it is possible to create full-sequence accounts from which aggregates, such as green GDP, can be derived and compared internationally, and many countries have begun this process.

Several reports and initiatives after the SEEA-1993 have explored the possibility of expanding or changing the scope of environmentally-adjusted macroeconomic indicators. As the popularity of green GDP and other environmentally adjusted macroeconomic indicators grows, their construction will increasingly draw on this continuously developing body of research, especially with respect to the methodology associated with valuing non-market capital (e.g., services from natural capital which exist outside of traditional market settings).

In 1993, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the official bookkeeper of the U.S. economy, began responding to concerns that the GDP needed retooling. The agency began working on a green accounting system called Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts. These initial results, released in 1994, showed that GDP numbers were overstating the impact of mining companies to the nation&#x27;s economic wealth. Mining companies did not like those results, and in 1995, Alan B. Mollohan, a Democratic House Representative from West Virginia&#x27;s coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 Appropriations Bill that stopped the Bureau of Economic Analysis from working on revising the GDP.

Costanza et al. (1997) estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16 biomes. The value of the entire biosphere, most of which exists outside of the market, is estimated conservatively to be between $16–54 trillion per year. By comparison, global GNP is approximately $18 trillion per year. The size of this figure demonstrates the significance of ecosystem services on human welfare and income generation, and the importance of identifying and recognizing this value. The valuation techniques used by the authors were often based on estimations of individuals&#x27; &quot;willingness-to-pay&quot; for ecosystem services.

Kunte et al. (1998) use their paper &quot;Estimating National Wealth: Methodology and Results&quot; to demonstrate that expanding the national accounts to include natural capital is a &quot;practical [and necessary] exercise&quot;. They estimate the total wealth of nations by including different components of wealth in their calculations, including natural capital. They place values on natural capital by using the concept of economic rent. &quot;Economic rent is the return on a commodity in excess of the minimum required to bring forth its services. Rental value is therefore the difference between the market price and cost of production / extraction.&quot; Following this, and by adjusting calculations for (un)sustainable use patterns, they are able to determine the stock of natural capital in a country that more accurately reflects its wealth.

&quot;Nature&#x27;s Numbers: Expanding the National Economic Accounts to Include the Environment,&quot; written by William Nordhaus and Edward Kokkelenberg and published in 1999, examined whether or not to broaden the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) to include natural resources and the environment. The panel, which addressed this question, concluded that extending the NIPA and developing supplemental environmental accounts should be a high-priority goal for the U.S., because these would provide useful data on a variety of economic issues and government trends, which entailed both replenishing and extractive activities. One of the major findings of the report is that it is fundamentally necessary for green adjustments to account for instances when natural capital is discovered or replenished, along with general depletive activities.

===Green GDP in China===

As one of the fastest-growing countries in the world, China noticed the green GDP as early as 1997. City authorities had conducted a survey based on Beijing&#x27;s GDP, and the result showed that around 75% of the total GDP was constituted by Green GDP, and the rest of the 25% flowed away as pollution. Other cities also started the same calculation. For example, green GDP in Yaan reported 80% of the total GDP, while Datong reported only 60%.

In 2004, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, announced that the green GDP index would replace the Chinese GDP index itself as a performance measure for government and party officials at the highest levels. China’s State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), together with the National Bureau of Statistics(NBS), the Chinese Academy for Environmental Planning(CAEP), and units from Renmin University, investigated the nationwide Green GDP. The major environmental impacts in China were from air, water, and solid waste pollution. The first green GDP accounting report, for 2004, was published in September 2006. It showed that the financial loss caused by pollution was 511.8 billion yuan ($66.3 billion), or 3.05 percent of the nation&#x27;s economy.

As an experiment in national accounting, the Green GDP effort collapsed in failure in 2007, when it became clear that the adjustment for environmental damage had reduced the growth rate to politically unacceptable levels, nearly zero in some provinces. In the face of mounting evidence that environmental damage and resource depletion was far more costly than anticipated, the government withdrew its support for the Green GDP methodology and suppressed the 2005 report, which had been due out in March, 2007. The failure of Green GDP in China is connected to the incongruity between central authorities and local government. Beijing was aware of the environmental costs of fast-growing GDP, and encouraged for cleaner or more efficient production. However, many local officials had direct connections with local businesses, and focused more on economic growth than damage by pollution. Another reason for the failure was due to the cost of data collection. It took both money and time to collect data and set them into databases. The Chinese government had a hard time collecting comprehensive environmental cost data. Only pollution and emission costs (air emissions, surface water pollution discards to land, and environmental accidents) were counted in, while social costs and natural resources depletion were missing.

Lang and Li (2009) use their paper &quot;China&#x27;s &#x27;Green GDP&#x27; Experiment and the Struggle for Ecological Modernisation&quot; to conclude that the attempt to implement green GDP was a signal that the Chinese government paid attention to environmental impacts. However, the fast-growing economy was more prioritized than environmental accounting, and the failure of the experiment was inevitable.

Independent estimates of the cost to China of environmental degradation and resource depletion have, for the last decade, ranged from 8 to 12 percentage points of GDP growth. These estimates support the idea that, by this measure at least, the growth of the Chinese economy is close to zero.

The most promising national activity on the green GDP has been from India. The country&#x27;s environmental minister, Jairam Ramesh, stated in 2009 that &quot;It is possible for scientists to estimate green GDP. An exercise has started under the country&#x27;s chief statistician Pronab Sen and by 2015, India&#x27;s GDP numbers will be adjusted with economic costs of environmental degradation.&quot;

==Organizations==
The Global Reporting Initiative&#x27;s (GRI) core goals include the mainstreaming of disclosure on environmental, social, and governance performance. Although the GRI is independent, it remains a collaborating centre of UNEP and works in cooperation with the United Nations Global Compact. It produces one of the world&#x27;s most prevalent standards for sustainability reporting—also known as ecological footprint reporting, environmental social governance (ESG) reporting, triple bottom line (TBL) reporting, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting. It is working on a green GDP to be implemented worldwide.

==Current debate==

Some critics of environmentally adjusted aggregates, including GDP, point out that it may be difficult to assign values to some of the outputs that are quantified. This is a particular difficulty in cases where the environmental asset does not exist in a traditional market and is therefore non-tradable. Ecosystem services are one example of this type of resource. In the case that valuation is undertaken indirectly, there is a possibility that calculations may rely on speculation or hypothetical assumptions.

Supporters of adjusted aggregates may reply to this objection in one of two ways. First, that as our technological capabilities increase, more accurate methods of valuation have been and will continue to develop. Second, that while measurements may not be perfect in the cases of non-market natural assets, the adjustments they entail are still a preferable alternative to traditional GDP.

A second objection may be found in the Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, when Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi remark that:

&quot;there is a more fundamental problem with green GDP, which also applies to Nordhaus and Tobin&#x27;s SMEW and to the ISEW/GNI indices. None of these measures characterize sustainability per se. Green GDP just charges GDP for the depletion of or damage to environmental resources. This is only one part of the answer to the question of sustainability.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, a Kakeya set, or Besicovitch set, is a set of points in Euclidean space which contains a unit line segment in every direction. For instance, a disk of radius 1/2 in the Euclidean plane, or a ball of radius 1/2 in three-dimensional space, forms a Kakeya set. Much of the research in this area has studied the problem of how small such sets can be. Besicovitch showed that there are Besicovitch sets of measure zero.

A Kakeya needle set (sometimes also known as a Kakeya set) is a (Besicovitch) set in the plane with a stronger property, that a unit line segment can be rotated continuously through 180 degrees within it, returning to its original position with reversed orientation. Again, the disk of radius 1/2 is an example of a Kakeya needle set.

==Kakeya needle problem==
The Kakeya needle problem asks whether there is a minimum area of a region formula_1 in the plane, in which a needle of unit length can be turned through 360°. This question was first posed, for convex regions, by . The minimum area for convex sets is achieved by an equilateral triangle of height 1 and area 1/, as Pál showed.

Kakeya seems to have suggested that the Kakeya set formula_1 of minimum area, without the convexity restriction, would be a three-pointed deltoid shape. However, this is false; there are smaller non-convex Kakeya sets.

==Besicovitch needle sets==
Besicovitch was able to show that there is no lower bound &gt; 0 for the area of such a region formula_1, in which a needle of unit length can be turned around. That is, for every formula_4, there is region of area formula_5 within which the needle can move through a continuous motion that rotates it a full 360 degrees. This built on earlier work of his, on plane sets which contain a unit segment in each orientation. Such a set is now called a Besicovitch set. Besicovitch&#x27;s work from 1919 showed such a set could have arbitrarily small measure, although the problem may have been considered by analysts before that.

One method of constructing a Besicovitch set (see figure for corresponding illustrations) is known as a &quot;Perron tree&quot;, named after Oskar Perron who was able to simplify Besicovitch&#x27;s original construction. The precise construction and numerical bounds are given in Besicovitch&#x27;s popularization.

The first observation to make is that the needle can move in a straight line as far as it wants without sweeping any area. This is because the needle is a zero width line segment. The second trick of Pál, known as Pál joins describes how to move the needle between any two locations that are parallel while sweeping negligible area. The needle will follow the shape of an &quot;N&quot;. It moves from the first location some distance formula_6 up the left of the &quot;N&quot;, sweeps out the angle to the middle diagonal, moves down the diagonal, sweeps out the second angle, 
and them moves up the parallel right side of the &quot;N&quot; until it reaches the required second location. The only non-zero area regions swept are the two triangles of height one and the angle at the top of the &quot;N&quot;. The swept area is proportional to this angle which is proportional to formula_7.

The construction starts with any triangle with height 1 and some substantial angle at the top through which the needle can easily sweep. The goal is to do many operations on this triangle to make its area smaller while keeping the directions through which the needle can sweep the same. 
First, consider dividing the triangle into two and translating the pieces over each other so that their bases overlap in a way that minimizes the total area.
The needle is able to sweep out the same directions by sweeping out those given by the first triangle, jumping over to the second, and then sweeping out the directions given by the second. The needle can jump triangles using the &quot;N&quot; technique because the two lines at which the original triangle was cut are parallel.

Now, we divide our triangle into 2&quot;n&quot; subtriangles. The figure shows eight.
For each consecutive pair of triangles, perform the same overlapping operation we described before to get half as many new shapes, each consisting of two overlapping triangles. Next, overlap consecutive pairs of these new shapes by shifting them so that their bases overlap in a way that minimizes the total area. Repeat this &quot;n&quot; times until there is only one shape. Again, the needle is able to sweep out the same directions by sweeping those out in each of the 
2&quot;n&quot; subtriangles in order of their direction. The needle can jump consecutive triangles using the &quot;N&quot; technique because the two lines at which these triangle were cut are parallel.

What remains is to compute the area of the final shape. Due to difficulty and length constraints the final argument cannot be fully included. Instead, an example will be shown.
Looking at the figure, it can be seen that the 2&quot;n&quot; subtriangles overlap a lot. All of them overlap at the bottom, half of them at the bottom of the left branch, a quarter of them at the bottom of the left left branch, and so on. 
Suppose that the area of each shape created with &quot;i&quot; merging operations from 2&quot;i&quot; subtriangles is bounded by &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
Before merging two of these shapes, they have area bounded be 2&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;. 
Then, move the two shapes together such that that they overlap as much as possible. 
In the worst case, these two regions are 
two 1 by ε rectangles perpendicular to each other so that they overlap at an area of only ε&quot;2&quot;. But the two shapes that we have constructed, if long and skinny, point in much of the same direction because they are made from consecutive groups of subtriangles. 
The handwaving states that they over lap by at least 1% of their area. Then the merged area would be bounded by 
&quot;A&quot;&quot;i+1&quot; = 1.99 &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The area of the original triangle is bounded by 1. Hence, the area of each subtriangle is bounded by 
&quot;A&quot;&quot;0&quot; = 2&quot;-n&quot; and the final shape has area bounded by 
&quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; = 1.99&quot;n&quot; × 2&quot;-n&quot;. In actuality, a careful summing up of all areas that do not overlap gives that the area of the final region is much bigger, namely, &quot;1/n&quot;. 
As &quot;n&quot; grows, this area shrinks to zero.
A Besicovitch set can be created by combining six rotations of a Perron tree created from an equilateral triangle.
A similar construction can be made with parallelograms. 

There are other methods for constructing Besicovitch sets of measure zero aside from the &#x27;sprouting&#x27; method. 
For example, Kahane uses Cantor sets to construct a Besicovitch set of measure zero in the two-dimensional plane.

In 1941, H. J. Van Alphen showed that there are arbitrary small Kakeya needle sets inside a circle with radius 2 + ε (arbitrary ε &gt; 0). Simply connected Kakeya needle sets with smaller area than the deltoid were found in 1965. Melvin Bloom and I. J. Schoenberg independently presented Kakeya needle sets with areas approaching to formula_8, the Bloom-Schoenberg number. Schoenberg conjectured that this number is the lower bound for the area of simply connected Kakeya needle sets. However, in 1971, F. Cunningham showed that, given ε &gt; 0, there is a simply connected Kakeya needle set of area less than ε contained in a circle of radius 1.

Although there are Kakeya needle sets of arbitrarily small positive measure and Besicovich sets of measure 0, there are no Kakeya needle sets of measure 0.

==Kakeya conjecture==

===Statement===
The same question of how small these Besicovitch sets could be was then posed in higher dimensions, giving rise to a number of conjectures known collectively as the &quot;Kakeya conjectures&quot;, and have helped initiate the field of mathematics known as geometric measure theory. In particular, if there exist Besicovitch sets of measure zero, could they also have s-dimensional Hausdorff measure zero for some dimension s less than the dimension of the space in which they lie? This question gives rise to the following conjecture:

:Kakeya set conjecture: Define a &quot;Besicovitch set&quot; in R&quot;n&quot; to be a set which contains a unit line segment in every direction. Is it true that such sets necessarily have Hausdorff dimension and Minkowski dimension equal to &quot;n&quot;?

This is known to be true for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2 but only partial results are known in higher dimensions.

In February 2025, a claimed proof for the case &quot;n&quot; = 3 was posted on arXiv by Hong Wang and Joshua Zahl.

===Kakeya maximal function===
A modern way of approaching this problem is to consider a particular type of maximal function, which we construct as follows: Denote S&quot;n&quot;−1 ⊂ R&quot;n&quot; to be the unit sphere in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space. Define formula_9 to be the cylinder of length 1, radius δ &gt; 0, centered at the point &quot;a&quot; ∈ R&quot;n&quot;, and whose long side is parallel to the direction of the unit vector &quot;e&quot; ∈ S&quot;n&quot;−1. Then for a locally integrable function &quot;f&quot;, we define the Kakeya maximal function of &quot;f&quot; to be

:formula_10

where &quot;m&quot; denotes the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Notice that formula_11 is defined for vectors &quot;e&quot; in the sphere S&quot;n&quot;−1.

Then there is a conjecture for these functions that, if true, will imply the Kakeya set conjecture for higher dimensions:

:Kakeya maximal function conjecture: For all ε &gt; 0, there exists a constant &quot;Cε&quot; &gt; 0 such that for any function &quot;f&quot; and all δ &gt; 0, (see lp space for notation)
::formula_12

=== Results===
Some results toward proving the Kakeya conjecture are the following:
* The Kakeya conjecture is true for &quot;n&quot; = 1 (trivially) and &quot;n&quot; = 2 (Davies).
* In any &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, Wolff showed that the dimension of a Kakeya set must be at least (&quot;n&quot;+2)/2.
* In 2002, Katz and Tao improved Wolff&#x27;s bound to formula_13, which is better for &quot;n&quot; &gt; 4.
* In 2000, Katz, Łaba, and Tao proved that the Minkowski dimension of Kakeya sets in 3 dimensions is strictly greater than 5/2.
* In 2000, Jean Bourgain connected the Kakeya problem to arithmetic combinatorics which involves harmonic analysis and additive number theory.
* In 2017, Katz and Zahl improved the lower bound on the Hausdorff dimension of Besicovitch sets in 3 dimensions to formula_14 for an absolute constant formula_15.
* In 2025, Wang and Zahl posted on arXiv a potential proof of the Kakeya conjecture in the case n = 3.

==Applications to analysis==
Somewhat surprisingly, these conjectures have been shown to be connected to a number of questions in other fields, notably in harmonic analysis. For instance, in 1971, Charles Fefferman was able to use the Besicovitch set construction to show that in dimensions greater than 1, truncated Fourier integrals taken over balls centered at the origin with radii tending to infinity need not converge in &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; norm when &quot;p&quot; ≠ 2 (this is in contrast to the one-dimensional case where such truncated integrals do converge).

==Analogues and generalizations of the Kakeya problem==

===Sets containing circles and spheres===
Analogues of the Kakeya problem include considering sets containing more general shapes than lines, such as circles.

* In 1997 and 1999, Wolff proved that sets containing a sphere of every radius must have full dimension, that is, the dimension is equal to the dimension of the space it is lying in, and proved this by proving bounds on a circular maximal function analogous to the Kakeya maximal function.

* It was conjectured that there existed sets containing a sphere around every point of measure zero. Results of Elias Stein proved all such sets must have positive measure when &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3, and Marstrand proved the same for the case &quot;n=2&quot;.

===Sets containing &quot;k&quot;-dimensional disks===
A generalization of the Kakeya conjecture is to consider sets that contain, instead of segments of lines in every direction, but, say, portions of &quot;k&quot;-dimensional subspaces. Define an (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;)-Besicovitch set &quot;K&quot; to be a compact set in R&quot;n&quot; containing a translate of every &quot;k&quot;-dimensional unit disk which has Lebesgue measure zero. That is, if &quot;B&quot; denotes the unit ball centered at zero, for every &quot;k&quot;-dimensional subspace &quot;P&quot;, there exists &quot;x&quot; ∈ R&quot;n&quot; such that (&quot;P&quot; ∩ &quot;B&quot;) + &quot;x&quot; ⊆ &quot;K&quot;. Hence, a (&quot;n&quot;, 1)-Besicovitch set is the standard Besicovitch set described earlier.

:The (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;)-Besicovitch conjecture: There are no (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;)-Besicovitch sets for &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1.

In 1979, Marstrand proved that there were no (3, 2)-Besicovitch sets. At around the same time, however, Falconer proved that there were no (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot;)-Besicovitch sets for 2&quot;k&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. The best bound to date is by Bourgain, who proved in that no such sets exist when 2&quot;k&quot;−1 + &quot;k&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;.

===Kakeya sets in vector spaces over finite fields===
In 1999, Wolff posed the finite field analogue to the Kakeya problem, in hopes that the techniques for solving this conjecture could be carried over to the Euclidean case.

:Finite Field Kakeya Conjecture: Let F be a finite field, let &quot;K&quot; ⊆ Fn be a Kakeya set, i.e. for each vector &quot;y&quot; ∈ F&quot;n&quot; there exists &quot;x&quot; ∈ F&quot;n&quot; such that &quot;K&quot; contains a line {&quot;x&quot; + &quot;ty&quot; : &quot;t&quot; ∈ F}. Then the set &quot;K&quot; has size at least &quot;cn&quot;|F|&quot;n&quot; where &quot;cn&quot;&gt;0 is a constant that only depends on &quot;n&quot;.

Zeev Dvir proved this conjecture in 2008, showing that the statement holds for &quot;cn&quot; = 1/&quot;n&quot;!. In his proof, he observed that any polynomial in &quot;n&quot; variables of degree less than |F| vanishing on a Kakeya set must be identically zero. On the other hand, the polynomials in &quot;n&quot; variables of degree less than |F| form a vector space of dimension

:formula_16

Therefore, there is at least one non-trivial polynomial of degree less than |F| that vanishes on any given set with less than this number of points. Combining these two observations shows that Kakeya sets must have at least |F|&quot;n&quot;/&quot;n&quot;! points.

It is not clear whether the techniques will extend to proving the original Kakeya conjecture but this proof does lend credence to the original conjecture by making essentially algebraic counterexamples unlikely. Dvir has written a survey article on progress on the finite field Kakeya problem and its relationship to randomness extractors.

<text>The Nottawasaga River is a river in Simcoe County and Dufferin County in Central Ontario, Canada. It is part of the Great Lakes Basin, and is a tributary of Lake Huron. The river flows from the Orangeville Reservoir in the town of Orangeville, Dufferin County, through the Niagara Escarpment and the Minesing Wetlands, the latter a wetland of international significance (Ramsar Convention site), and empties into Nottawasaga Bay, an inlet of Georgian Bay on Lake Huron, at the town of Wasaga Beach, Simcoe County.

The river takes its name from the Ojibwe word &quot;Nottawasaga&quot;. &quot;Nottawa&quot; (or &quot;Naadowe&quot; in modern orthography) means &quot;Iroquois&quot; and &quot;saga&quot; (&quot;zaagi&quot; in modern orthography) means &quot;mouth of the river&quot;; the word &quot;Nottawasaga&quot; (&quot;Naddowe-zaagi&quot; in modern orthography) was used by Algonquin scouts as a warning if they saw Iroquois raiding parties approaching their villages.

Thus, the name of the river, in Ojibwe is &quot;Naadawe-zaaga-ziibi&quot;.

==Watershed==
The Nottawasaga River&#x27;s headwaters originate in the Niagara Escarpment, Simcoe Uplands, Oak Ridges Moraine and Oro Moraine. The area of the drainage basin is , and as well as Dufferin County and Simcoe County, is located in Grey County and the Regional Municipality of Peel.

==History==
The Nottawasaga River is the resting home of HMS &quot;Nancy&quot;, a merchant schooner taken into the Royal Navy during the War of 1812. It met three American warships: , and . The small ship lost the battle but Lt. Miller Worsley and crew escaped. They rowed 360 miles to Fort Michilimackinac and three days later, Worsley returned with 92 men to take the &quot;Tigress&quot; and &quot;Scorpion&quot;. Since her sinking, an island formed around the &quot;Nancy&quot;. The hull is now preserved in a museum at Nancy Island Historic Site which is a part of Wasaga Beach Provincial Park.

==Natural history==
Fish ladders allow rainbow trout to reach spawning grounds on the upper river. The river is under the auspices of the Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority.

<text>Johann Friedrich Böhmer (22 April 179522 October 1863) was a German historian. His historical work was chiefly concerned with collecting and tabulating charters and other imperial documents of the Middle Ages.

==Biography==
Böhmer was born in Frankfurt as the son of the Palatine official Karl Ludwig Böhmer. Educated at the universities of Heidelberg and Göttingen, he showed an interest in art and visited Italy; but returning to Frankfurt he turned his attention to the study of history, and became secretary of the &quot;Gesellschaft für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde&quot;. He was also archivist and then librarian of the city of Frankfurt.

Böhmer had a great dislike of Prussia and the Protestant faith, and a corresponding affection for Austria and the Roman Catholic Church, to which, however, he did not belong. His researches are of great value to students. He died unmarried.

Johannes Janssen wrote a biography in three volumes in 1868 of Böhmer, a man whom he considered as his teacher and guide.

==Historical work==
Böhmer&#x27;s historical work was chiefly concerned with collecting and tabulating charters and other imperial documents of the Middle Ages. First appeared an abstract, the &quot;Regesta chronologico-diplomatica regum atque imperatorum Romanorum 911-1313&quot; (Frankfurt, 1831), which was followed by the &quot;Regesta chronologico-diplomatica Karolorum. Die Urkunden sämtlicher Karolinger in kurzen Auszügen&quot; (Frankfurt, 1833), and a series of &quot;Regesta imperii&quot;. For the period 1314-1347 (Frankfurt, 1839) the &quot;Regesta&quot; was followed by three, and for the period 1246-1313 (Frankfurt, 1844) by two supplementary volumes. The remaining period of the &quot;Regesta&quot;, as edited by Böhmer, is 1198-1254 (Stuttgart, 1849). These collections contain introductions and explanatory passages by the author.

Very valuable also is the &quot;Fontes rerum Germanicarum&quot; (Stuttgart, 1843–1868), a collection of original authorities for German history during the 13th and 14th centuries. The fourth and last volume of this work was edited by A. Huber after the author&#x27;s death. Other collections edited by Böhmer are: &quot;Die Reichsgesetze 900-1400&quot; (Frankfurt, 1832); &quot;Wittelsbachische Regesten von der Erwerbung des Herzogtums Bayern 1180 bis zu dessen erster Wiedervereinigung 1340&quot; (Stuttgart, 1854); and &quot;Codex diplomaticus Moeno-Francofurtanus&quot;. &quot;Urkundenbuch der Reichsstadt Frankfurt&quot; (Frankfurt, 1836; new edition by F Law, 1901).

Other volumes and editions of the &quot;Regesta imperii&quot;, edited by Julius von Ficker, Engelbert Mühlbacher, Eduard Winkelmann and others, are largely based on Böhmer&#x27;s work. Böhmer left a great amount of unpublished material, and after his death two other works were published from his papers: &quot;Acta imperii selecta&quot;, edited by J. Ficker (Innsbruck, 1870); and &quot;Regesta archiepiscoporum Maguntinensium&quot;, edited by C Will (Innsbruck, 1877–1886).

<text>ES PEVM (ЕС ПЭВМ) was a Soviet clone of the IBM PC in the 1980s. The ES PEVM models lineup also included analogues of IBM PC XT, IBM PC AT, IBM XT/370.

The computers and software were adapted in Minsk, Belarus, at the Scientific Research Institute of Electronic Computer Machines (НИИ ЭВМ). 

They were manufactured in Minsk as well, at Minsk Production Group for Computing Machinery (Минское производственное объединение вычислительной техники (МПО ВТ)).

== Description ==


The first models of ES PEVM (ES-1840, ES-1841, ES-1842), unlike the IBM PC, had two units: a system unit and a floppy drives unit. These models used a backplane instead of the main board. Although the system bus was compatible with ISA bus, it used a different type of connector, so the IBM PC expansion cards could not be installed in ES PEVM.
Later models (ES-1843, ES-1849 etc.) were fully-compatible with IBM PC XT and IBM PC AT.

Unlike IBM PC using the Intel 8088 processor, the early ES PEVM models used K1810VM86 processor with a 16-bit bus and a clock frequency of 5 MHz. The processor was placed on a separate board. Early versions of the board did not have a socket for the floating point coprocessor.

The following boards were produced for ES-1840 and ES-1841:
* CPU board (containing 54 chips). It was installed in every configuration of the computer.
* 128 KiB RAM board. It was installed in early models of ES PEVM.
* 512 KiB RAM board (containing 110 chips). Variants with 256 KiB or 128 Kib were available.
* MDA adapter board (containing 91 chips). It was built using the Bulgarian CM607 chip (MC6845 clone).
* CGA adapter board (containing 94 chips).
* Floppy drive adapter board (containing 32 chips). It was built using the Bulgarian CM609 chip (Intel 8272 clone).
* Serial interface adapter board (containing 56 chips). It was electrically incompatible with the IBM PC COM port and was not supported in the BIOS.

Volume of production for a number of models:
== Software ==
The computers were shipped with AlphaDOS, an entirely Russified version of MS-DOS/PC DOS 2.x and 3.x. All commands were entered in Russian, for example, codice_1 for codice_2. Files and file extensions were also in Russian, such as АТРИБ.ИСП for ATTRIB.EXE. The operating system used the main code page, hardwired into the display ROM; it was compatible neither with CP 866 nor CP 855, although partially with ISO/IEC 8859-5.

== Reliability ==
Early models of ES PEVM were prone to failures due to manufacturing defects. The mean time between failures was around 350 hours.

<text>The Bower Manuscript is a collection of seven fragmentary Sanskrit treatises found buried in a Buddhist memorial stupa near Kucha, northwestern China. Written in early Gupta script (late Brahmi ) on birch bark, it is variously dated in 5th to early 6th century. The Bower manuscript includes the oldest dated fragments of an Indian medical text, the &quot;Navanitaka&quot;.

The seven treatises included in the collection three on Ayurvedic medicine, two on divination by dice, and two on incantations (Dharani) against snake bites. The collection had at least four scribes, of which three were likely Buddhists because the second, the sixth and the seventh treatises open by invoking the Buddha and other Buddhist deities. Two invoke Shiva, Vishnu, Devi, and other Hindu deities. The discovery of the manuscript in remote China near Central Asian region is considered evidence of the spread and sharing of ideas in ancient times between India, China and Central Asia. It also contains excerpts of the &quot;Bhela Samhita&quot;, a medical text whose damaged manuscript is in Tanjavur, Tamil Nadu. The medical fragments of the Bower manuscript have much in common with other ancient Sanskrit medical treatises such as those by Caraka, Ravigupta, Vagbhata and Kashyapa.

The manuscript is named after Hamilton Bower – a British Lieutenant who bought the manuscript in March 1890 while on a mission to chase an assassin who was charged with hacking Andrew Dalgleish to death. The fragmentary manuscript was analyzed, edited, translated, and published by Calcutta-based Rudolf Hoernle. The Bower Manuscript is preserved in the collections of the Bodleian Library in Oxford.

==Discovery and edition==

The Bower Manuscript is named after its accidental purchaser Hamilton Bower, a British Army Lieutenant. The story begins with the brutal murder of Andrew Dalgliesh, a Scotsman camping in the Karakoram mountains, north of Kashmir. He was hacked to death inside his tent by an Afghan named Dad Mahomed. The British government wanted to bring Mahomed to justice, and therefore sent Hamilton Bower with some troops to go after the killer, states Wujastyk. Mahomed learned about the effort and escaped. Bower, in the chase, followed Mahomed through the Himalayan valleys into the Takla Makan desert. Bower arrived near Kucha (Xinjiang) in early March 1890 and set his camp. On the night of 2 or 3 March, a man came to his tent and offered to sell him old manuscripts and artifacts that his treasure hunters had found. Bower bought them.

Bower took the manuscripts with him when he returned to Simla and forwarded it to Colonel James Waterhouse, the then President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Waterhouse reported the manuscript at the monthly meeting of the Society on 5 November 1890, whose proceedings were widely distributed. At the meeting, he stated that Bower visited the site where the manuscript was found, and referred to the stupa as something that looked like a huge &quot;cottage loaf&quot; near the &quot;Ming–oi&quot; Buddhist monastery ruins, 16 miles from Kucha near the banks of a river. Waterhouse mentioned that the Bower manuscript had 56 leaves (the edition now preserved at Bodleian Library has 51 leaves). He reported that the Bower manuscript was bound with two wooden boards on either end and a string running through a hole. He had sought the help of Babu Sarat Chandra Das and Lama Phuntshog to decipher the manuscript. Neither was able to read the script and said it must be &quot;very ancient&quot;, according to Waterhouse.

The Waterhouse report was reprinted in &quot;Bombay Gazette&quot;, where Hoernle learned about it and became very eager to study it. After the meeting, in parallel, some attempts were made to decipher the manuscript, but they proved unsuccessful. German Indologist Georg Buhler succeeded in reading and translating two leaves of the manuscript, reproduced in the form of heliogravures in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.

Immediately after his return to India in February 1891, Hoernle began to study the manuscript. He found that the manuscript leaves were jumbled out of sequence, but had the page numbers marked on the left. After re-arranging them, he concluded that it was an abridged collection of several different treatises. He presented the first decipherment two months later, at the meeting of the Society in April 1891, with evidence that it was &quot;the oldest Indian written book that is known to exist&quot;. Between 1893 and 1897 Hoernle published a complete edition of the text, featuring an annotated English translation and illustrated facsimile plates. A Sanskrit Index was published in 1908, and a revised translation of the medical portions (I, II, and III) in 1909; the Introduction appeared in 1912.

==Description and dating==
The &#x27;Bower Manuscript&#x27; is a collation of seven treatise manuscripts, compiled into a larger group and another a smaller one. The larger manuscript is a fragmentary convolute of six treatises (Part I, II, III, IV, V and VII), which are separately paginated, with each leaf approximately 29 square inches (11.5 inch x 2.5 inch). Part VI is written on smaller folio leaves, both in length and breadth, with each leaf approximately 18 square inches (9 inch x 2 inch). The larger group and the smaller set likely came from different trees or region. The scribes wrote on both sides of the leaves but did not use both sides when the leaf was very thin. These seven constituent manuscripts are numbered as Parts I to VII in Hoernle&#x27;s edition.

The Bower manuscript, as discovered, had 56 birch bark leaves, cut into oblong palmyra shape (rectangular strips with rounded corners). This is the form commonly found in numerous ancient and medieval Indian manuscript books (&quot;pothī&quot;). The pages are bound in Indian style, with each leaf containing a hole about the middle of the left side, for the passage of the binding string. The undamaged leaves of the Bower manuscript are numbered on the left edge of the reverse side, a tradition found in ancient &quot;pothi&quot; manuscripts in north India, in contrast to the historic south Indian tradition of numbering the obverse side in manuscripts. This suggests that the Bower manuscript scribes were trained in the north Indian tradition.

The seven parts of the manuscript are written in an essentially identical script, the Gupta script (late Brahmi) found in north, northwest and western regions of ancient India. Early attempts to date the text placed it around 5th-century, largely on palaeographic grounds. Hoernle determined that the manuscript belonged to the 4th or 5th–century because the script used matched with dated inscriptions and other texts of that period in the north and northwest India. He also compared the style and script for numerals – particularly zero and position value – and the page numbering style in the manuscript with those found in Indian inscriptions and manuscripts. By combining such evidence with palaeographic evidence therein, he concluded that the Bower manuscript could not be dated in or after the second half of the 6th century. Hoernle remarked that at least some treatises of the manuscript &quot;must fall somewhere within that period [470 and 530 CE], that is, about 500 CE.&quot;

Winand M. Callewaert dates it to c. 450 CE. According to a 1986 analysis by Lore Sander, the Bower manuscript is best dated between 500 and 550 CE.

===Scribes===
The fragmentary treatises are copies of much older Indian texts authored by unknown scholars. These treatises were prepared by scribes, buried in a stupa built at some point to honor the memory of a Buddhist monk or some other regional influential person. Hoernle distinguished four scribes, based on their handwriting, subtle font and style differences. One scribe wrote Parts I, II and III; second wrote Part IV; third wrote Parts V and VII; while a fourth wrote Part VI. He added that there may have been more than four scribes, because Part VI has some scribal differences, while V and VII too seems cursive and careless work of possibly more than one person.

Based on the handwriting and fonts prevalent in the inscriptions discovered in India from that era, Hoernle suggested the first scribe who wrote Parts I through III likely grew up and came from Kashmir or Udyana (North India) to Kucha (China) because his writing shows early Sarada script influences. Part VI, and possibly V and VII were written by scribe(s) who may have come to China from a region that is now the central India to Andhra Pradesh, for similar reasons. The writer of part IV appears to have the style of someone used to &quot;writing with a brush&quot;, and therefore may have been a local native or a Buddhist monk who came from interior China.

==Contents==
The text consists of seven separate and different treatises, of which first three are on medicine, next two on divination, and last two on magical incantations. The three medicinal treatises contain content that is also found in the ancient Indian text called the Caraka Samhita. Treatises I to III are the medical treatises of the collection and contain 1,323 verses and some prose. The metrical writing suggests that the scribe of the three medical treatises was well versed in Sanskrit composition. The scribe of divination and incantation sections (Treatises IV-VII) was not conversant with classical Sanskrit, made grammatical errors and used a few Prakrit words.

The manuscript is mostly in the Shloka verse style – a Vedic anuṣṭubh poetic meter (exceptions are found in Part I of the collection). The Bower Manuscript is written in the Gupta script – a type of late Brahmi script.

===Medical treatises===

Part I has 5 leaves, and the incomplete treatise ends abruptly. It is a fragment of a treatise on garlic, it medicinal properties and recipes, its use for eye diseases. It opens with a flowery description of the Himalayas, where a group of &quot;rishis&quot; reside, interested in the names and properties of medicinal plants. It mentions Hindu sages such as Ātreya, Hārīta, Parāśara, Bhela, Garga, Śāmbavya, Suśruta, Vasiṣṭha, Karāla, and Kāpya. Suśruta, whose curiosity is aroused by a particular plant, approaches muni Kāśirāja, enquiring about the nature of this plant. Kāśīrāja, granting his request, tells him about the origin of the plant, which proves to be garlic (Sanskrit &quot;laśuna&quot;), its properties and uses. The section on garlic consists of 43 verses in poetic meter. This section also mentions the ancient Indian tradition of &quot;garlic festival&quot;, as well as a mention of sage Sushruta in Benares (Varanasi). This is the part where the initial 43 verses are in eighteen different, uncommon meters (Sanskrit prosody) such as the &quot;vasanta tilaka&quot;, &quot;trishtubh&quot; and &quot;arya&quot;, while the verses thereafter are in the &quot;shloka&quot; style. The verses credit the knowledge to past sages. Verse 9, for example, attributes the knowledge to Susruta, who received it from the sage king of Kashi.

Part II abruptly ends on the 33rd folio of the Bower manuscript. It is voluminous, relative to the other six treatises, and contains medical prescriptions sections on powder, medicated &quot;ghee&quot; (clarified butter), oil, elixirs, aphrodisiacs, decoctions, dyes and ointments. It opens with a salutation addressed to the Tathāgatas, contains, as stated by the scribe, the &quot;Navanītaka&quot; text (&quot;lit.&quot; &quot;cream&quot; text), a standard manual (siddhasaṃkarṣa). Then it states its intention to provide 16 chapters of prescriptions (but the surviving fragment only provides 14, ending abruptly). According to G.J. Meulenbeld, &quot;an important peculiarity of the Bower MS consists of its varying attitude towards the number of the doṣas [humours]. In many instances, it accepts the traditional number of three, vāta, pitta, and kapha, but in a smaller number of passages it also appears to accept blood (rakta) as a doṣa.&quot;

Part III consists of 4 leaves and also ends abruptly on the obverse side of the folio (Part IV starts on reverse). It starts with the symbol Om as usual with the other treatises, and is a short treatise on 14 prescription formulary in a manner similar to Part II. It consists of 72 &quot;shlokas&quot;. It is a fragment whose contents correspond to chapters one to three of the Part II.

===Divination treatises===
Parts IV and V contain two short manuals of &quot;Pāśaka kevalī&quot;, or cubomancy, i.e., the art of foretelling a person&#x27;s future by means of the cast of dice, a ritualistic practice found in Tibetan manuscripts. Part IV is almost complete, while the manual constituting Part V is markedly more fragmentary and defective. The dice is stated to be a group of three dice, each with four faces (tetrahedron) numbered 1, 2, 3 and 4. When cast, it would yield one of 64 possible casts, of which 60 combinations are listed in Part IV (the missing 4 may be scribal error or lost; but those 4 are mentioned in later verses). Hoernle mentioned that Part V is similar to other Sanskrit manuscripts discovered in Gujarat, and like it, these parts of the Bower manuscript may be one of the several recensions of a more ancient common source on divinatory work. These are traditionally attributed to the ancient sage Garga, but maybe an influence of the Greek oracle tradition during the post-Alexander the Great period.

===Dharani treatises===
Parts VI and VII contain two different portions of the same text, the Mahāmāyurī, Vidyārājñī, a Buddhist dhāraṇī-genre incantations text. The &quot;Mayuri&quot; text, in later centuries, became a part of the &quot;Pancha-raksha&quot; magical incantations group – one of the highly popular &quot;dharani&quot; sets in Buddhist communities in and outside India. Part VI of the Bower manuscript contains charms against cobra bite, while Part VII is for protecting against other evils befalling a person. Both these parts are a small select portion of the actual Mayuri text, and tiny compared to the much larger &quot;dharani&quot; compilations. Part VI is complete, written on better quality birch and is the most well preserved treatise in the Bower manuscript. According to Watanabe, the verses of these treatises as found in folio 49 to 54 of the Bower manuscript completely correspond to those found in &quot;Mahamayurividya-rajni&quot; verses of the Chinese Tripitaka, in particular to the 705 CE translation by I-tsing, the 746–771 CE translation by Amoghavajra, and the 516 CE translation by Sanghapala. Their shared source may be Pali verses in the &quot;Mora Jataka&quot;, with interpolations by Mahayana Buddhists of that era. These parts of the Bower manuscript also contain the name Yashomitra, likely the votary or the influential person for whom the manuscript was prepared. According to Hoernle, Yashomitra may well have been a Buddhist monk of great repute, the one for whom the stupa was built, and in whose memory the manuscript was prepared and buried in the stupa mound.

== Legacy ==
The discovery of the Bower Manuscript, its antiquity, and its decipherment by Hoernle triggered &quot;enormous excitement&quot; in the 1890s, states Wujastyk. Famous explorers were commissioned by some of the world&#x27;s major powers of the era – such as Britain, Germany, Japan, France, Russia – to go on a Central Asia and Xinjiang expedition. They were to seek manuscripts and other ancient treasures. These expeditions yielded major discoveries such as the Dunhuang manuscripts, as well as famous forgeries such as those of Islam Akhun, in the decades that followed.

The European Union-funded International Dunhuang Project has continued the legacy of the Bower manuscript which in part inspired Rudolf Hornle to seek funds from the then Government of India to finance the first 1900–1901 expedition of Marc Aurel Stein.

<text>&quot;Empok Nor&quot; is the 122nd episode of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, the 24th episode of the fifth season. The episode aired on television on May 19, 1997. The screenplay was written by Bryan Fuller and Hans Beimler, and it was directed by Mike Vejar.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, a space station near the planet Bajor, as the Bajorans recover from a brutal decades-long occupation by the imperialistic Cardassians. In this episode, Miles O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;&#x27;s chief of operations, leads a team to the abandoned Cardassian space station Empok Nor to salvage equipment for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. To accomplish this mission, it is necessary to overcome booby traps, including two Cardassian soldiers lying in wait on the station to eliminate intruders.

==Plot==
Chief O&#x27;Brien needs to replace a failing component of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;&#x27;s machinery. The only way to obtain a replacement is by salvaging it from &quot;Empok Nor&quot;, an abandoned Cardassian space station built to the same design as &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. The salvage team consists of O&#x27;Brien, Cardassian ex-spy Garak, cadet Nog, engineers Pechetti and Boq&#x27;ta, and security officers Stolzoff and Amaro. As Cardassians routinely booby-trap abandoned facilities against non-Cardassian intruders, Garak is brought along to help disarm the security measures, and Garak uses the time to bring up O&#x27;Brien and his actions as a soldier on Setlik III against Cardassians.

On the abandoned station, the team discovers two empty and recently deactivated stasis tubes, and a third one with a dead Cardassian soldier, whose uniform marks him as a member of an elite and ruthless battalion. Suddenly, the away team&#x27;s runabout detaches from the station and explodes, stranding them inside with no means to send for help and under threat from the two recently-awoken Cardassians. The team splits into groups to continue the salvage and attempt to establish communications.

The Cardassian soldiers methodically ambush and eliminate Pechetti and Stolzoff. Garak decides to go on the offensive and track down the enemy soldiers himself. He returns after killing one of them, and relays his discovery that the soldiers had been subjected to psychotropic drugs which amplify their natural xenophobic tendencies. The second soldier ambushes Boq&#x27;ta, but Garak emerges and kills him before he can kill Amaro, only to then stab Amaro himself.

O&#x27;Brien and Nog discover Amaro, who tells them what happened, before dying from his injuries. O&#x27;Brien realizes Garak has been affected by the same drug as the soldiers, and sets out to stop him. Garak captures Nog, using him to draw O&#x27;Brien out. O&#x27;Brien consents to lay down his weapons and face Garak in hand-to-hand combat, but disables him with his own trap, having rigged his phaser to explode.

The three are rescued after collecting the parts they needed. Back on &quot;DS9&quot;, O&#x27;Brien visits Garak in the infirmary. Garak expresses his sincere regret over his actions; O&#x27;Brien informs him there will be an inquest, but it will be made clear that Garak was not responsible for his actions. Garak remarks that he was lucky the phaser did not kill him, but O&#x27;Brien admits that he had intended for it to do just that.

==Production==
=== Writing ===
This episode was one of the first written by Bryan Fuller, who went to write dozens more episodes in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Other series he wrote for include &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;. Fuller got his start as a writer through the open submission policy of &quot;Star Trek&quot; at that time, and his submission for a &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; plot was accepted. After his second script for &quot;DS9&quot; was accepted, he was hired as a writer for &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

=== Cast ===
In addition to the regular &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; cast, this episode features recurring characters Garak, played by Andrew J. Robinson, and Nog, played by Aron Eisenberg. Guest stars include Tom Hodges as Pechetti, Andy Milder as Boq&#x27;ta, Marjean Holden as Stolzoff and Jeffrey King as Amaro.

==Reception==
Keith DeCandido of &quot;Tor.com&quot; gave the episode four out of ten. 
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it &quot;creepy, thrilling, and horrifying by turns; the script’s only real failing is in a refusal to go much deeper under the surface of its premise than tension requires.&quot;

&quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked this episode the 13th best written by Bryan Fuller, in a review of episodes by him.

In 2017, this episode was noted as featuring scary or eerie &quot;Star Trek&quot; content by H&amp;I. In 2018, &quot;The Gamer&quot; ranked this one of the top 25 creepiest episodes of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They categorized this episode as a psychological thriller and slasher genre.

In 2019, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked this the tenth best episode for the character Nog, noting how he helps Miles O&#x27;Brien despite being a hostage. In 2021, they ranked &quot;Empok Nor&quot; the seventh scariest episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise television episodes, remarking that &quot;Empok Nor&quot; is one of the most unsettling &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes of all time.

<text>Eduard Winkelmann (June 25, 1838 – February 10, 1896) was a German historian.

==Biography==
He was born at Danzig (Gdańsk) in the Province of Prussia. He studied at the universities of Berlin and Göttingen, worked at the &quot;Monumenta Germaniae historica&quot;, and in 1869 became professor of history at the University of Bern, and four years later at Heidelberg. He also spent some time in the Russian Empire, where he was headmaster at the knight and chapter school in Reval (Tallinn) beginning in 1860, and was later appointed professor at the University of Dorpat (1865). He died at Heidelberg.

==Works==
Winkelmann wrote a &quot;Geschichte der Angelsachsen bis zum Tode König Ælfreds&quot; (Berlin, 1883); and his residence in Russia induced him to compile a &quot;Bibliotheca Livoniae historica&quot; (St Petersburg, 1869–1870, and Berlin, 1878); but his chief works deal with the history of the Holy Roman Empire during the Later Middle Ages.

The most important of these are:
* &quot;Philipp van Schwaben und Otto IV van Braunschweig&quot; (Leipzig, 1873–1878)
* &quot;Geschichte Kaiser Friedrichs II und seiner Reiche 1212–1235&quot; (Berlin, 1863) and &quot;1235–1250&quot; (Reval, 1865)
* &quot;Kaiser Friedrich II&quot; (Leipzig, 1889–1898)
* Writings on Friedrich II in the &quot;Jahrbücher der deutschen Geschichte&quot; (Leipzig, 1862)

He edited the &quot;Acta imperii inedita&quot; (Innsbruck, 1880-1885), and with Julius Ficker, &quot;Die Regesten des Kaiserreichs unter Wilhelm, Alfons X und Richard&quot; (Innsbruck, 1882, 1901).

Among Winkelmann&#x27;s other works are:
* &quot;Forschungen zur deutschen Geschichte&quot; (1872)
* &quot;Allgemeine Verfassungsgeschichte&quot; (Leipzig, 1901)
* &quot;Urkundenbuch der Universität Heidelberg&quot; (Heidelberg, 1886) (Bd. 1, Bd. 1).

<doc id="588290" wikidata="Q2337549" url="?curid=588290" title="The Emergency (Ireland)">
<text>The Emergency () was a state of emergency in the independent state of Ireland in the Second World War, throughout which the state remained neutral. It was proclaimed by Dáil Éireann on 2 September 1939, allowing the passage of the Emergency Powers Act 1939 by the Oireachtas the following day. This gave sweeping powers to the government, including internment, censorship of the press and correspondence, and control of the economy. The Emergency Powers Act lapsed on 2 September 1946, although the Emergency was not formally ended until 1976.

==Background of the Emergency==
On 6 December 1922, following the Anglo-Irish Treaty that ended the War of Independence, the island of Ireland became an autonomous dominion, known as the Irish Free State. On 7 December 1922, the parliament of the six north-eastern counties, already known as Northern Ireland, voted to opt out of the Irish Free State and rejoin the United Kingdom. This Treaty settlement was immediately followed by the Irish Civil War between the pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty factions of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).

After 1932, the governing party of the new state was the republican Fianna Fáil, led by Éamon de Valera (a veteran of both Irish wars and Easter Rising). In 1937, de Valera introduced a new constitution, which had distanced the state further from the United Kingdom, and which changed its name to &quot;Ireland&quot;. He had also conducted the Anglo-Irish trade war between 1932 and 1938.

De Valera had good relations with the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain. He resolved the two countries&#x27; economic differences, and negotiated the return of the Treaty Ports—Berehaven, Cobh, and Lough Swilly—which had remained under British jurisdiction under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. The major remaining disagreement between the countries was the status of Northern Ireland. The Irish saw it as rightfully Irish territory, while the UK saw it as rightfully British territory. Within Ireland itself, armed opposition to the treaty settlement took the name of the anti-treaty IRA, seeing itself as the &quot;true&quot; government of Ireland. This IRA mounted a sabotage/bombing campaign, the S-Plan, exclusively in England from January 1939 to March 1940. These attacks consisted of approximately 300 explosions and acts of sabotage, resulting in 10 deaths and 96 injuries.

==Declaration of the Emergency==

On 1 September 1939, German troops invaded Poland from the west (followed on 17 September by the Soviet Union from the east), precipitating war with the UK, France, and their allies. On 2 September, de Valera told the Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament) that neutrality was the best policy for the country. In this he was almost universally supported by the Dáil and the country at large (although many joined the British military). The 1937 constitution was amended to allow the government to take emergency powers, and then the Emergency Powers Act 1939 was passed that included censorship of the press and mail correspondence. The government was able to take control of the economic life of the country under the new Minister of Supply Seán Lemass. Liberal use was made of all of these powers. Internment of those who had committed a crime or were about to commit one would be used extensively against the IRA. Censorship was under the charge of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, Frank Aiken. It was necessary to prevent publication of matters that might undermine the neutrality of the state and to prevent it becoming a clearing house for foreign intelligence, though over the period of the Emergency, the Act started to be used for more party political purposes such as preventing the publication of the numbers of Irish soldiers serving in the United Kingdom armed forces or industrial disputes within the state. In addition, the information made available to Irish people was also controlled. De Valera performed the duties of Minister of External Affairs, though the secretary for the Department of External Affairs, Joseph Walshe, was very influential.

Most emergency measures were made by secondary legislation in the form of statutory orders under the Emergency Powers Act; the only other emergency primary legislation was the General Elections (Emergency Provisions) Act 1943, which allowed the 1943 and 1944 general elections to be held without a preceding dissolution of the Dáil. This was to allow the old Dáil to continue in the event that the election could not be completed.

==Neutrality policy==

On the declaration of the emergency, Walshe asked for assurances from the German minister in Dublin, Eduard Hempel, that Germany would not use its legation for espionage nor attack Irish trade with Great Britain. He then travelled to London on 6 September where he met the Dominions Secretary, Anthony Eden, who was conciliatory and defended Irish neutrality in subsequent Cabinet meetings. In addition, the appointment of Sir John Maffey as a British representative in Dublin was agreed.

For the Irish government, neutrality meant not displaying alignment with either side. On one hand, that meant the open announcement of military activity such as the sighting of submarines or the arrival of parachutists and the suppression of any foreign intelligence activity. Ireland&#x27;s geographic position meant that this policy (which was, in the view of most historians, applied fully and consistently) tended to benefit the Allies more than Germany. For example, British airmen who crash-landed in the State were allowed to go free if they could claim not to have been on a combat mission; otherwise they were released &quot;on licence&quot; (promise to remain). Many chose to escape to Great Britain via Northern Ireland. Also, Allied mechanics were allowed to retrieve crash-landed Allied aircraft. There was extensive co-operation between British and Irish intelligence and the exchange of information such as detailed weather reports of the Atlantic Ocean; the decision to go ahead with the D-day landings was influenced by a weather report from Blacksod Bay, County Mayo.

On the other hand, in the first few years of the war, the government did not show any overt preference for either side. This is partly because de Valera had to keep national unity, which meant accommodating the large swathe of Irish society that rejected anything to do with the British, some of whom admired Germany (which had failed in an attempt to supply a small cache of arms to the rebels of 1916) to some extent. These attitudes were shared by Aiken and by Walshe. Many, including de Valera and Richard Mulcahy, estimated Irish popular sympathies as favouring Germany due to anti-British hostility, and de Valera feared that joining the Allies would drive public opinion completely towards the Germans. The Fianna Fáil government, headed by de Valera, ruled alone and did not accommodate any other party in decision making.

==The IRA and the Emergency==
In the early months of the emergency, the greatest threat to the State came from the IRA. In the Christmas Raid in 1939, one million rounds of ammunition were stolen from the Irish Army by the IRA (though it was mostly recovered in the following weeks) and there were a number of killings, mostly of policemen. In addition, the existing emergency legislation was undermined by the obtaining of a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; by Seán MacBride which resulted in the release of all those who had been interned. The government responded with the 1939 and 1940 Offences Against the State Acts, which established the Special Criminal Court, and rearrested and interned IRA activists.

During this time two IRA men died as the result of hunger strikes – demanding free association and to have two prisoners (IRA Volunteers Nicky Doherty of County Meath and John Dwyer) moved from the criminal wing to the Republican area within the prison (Mountjoy Jail). On 17 February 1940 Tony D&#x27;Arcy was arrested and sentenced to three months for refusing to account for his movements and for not giving his name and address. IRA volunteer D&#x27;Arcy died as a result of a 52 day Hunger-strike (16 April 1940) at the age of 32. At the time of his death D&#x27;Arcy left a wife and three young children.
On 29 December 1939 Jack McNeela and several others were arrested in south Dublin at a location where an illegal radio transmitter was operating. McNeela and three other IRA men were imprisoned in Mountjoy Jail, tried (and found guilty) by a military tribunal for &quot;conspiracy to usurp a function of Government&quot; by operating a pro-Irish Republican pirate radio station, with McNeela being sentenced to two years imprisonment. With no concessions from the Irish Free State government, McNeela died on 19 April 1940 after 55 days on hunger strike in the Military Wing of St Bricin&#x27;s Military Hospital, Dublin.

Two IRA men (Patrick McGrath and Thomas Harte) were executed for the murder of two policemen in September 1940. The IRA became increasingly ineffective in the face of the resolute use of internment, the breaking of hunger strikes, and the application of hanging for capital offences. A total of seven IRA men were executed in Ireland between September 1940 and December 1944: Patrick McGrath, Thomas Harte, Richard Goss, George Plant, and Maurice O’Neill were executed by firing squad, while two others were hanged – Tom Williams in Crumlin Road Gaol, Belfast) and Charlie Kerins in Mountjoy Jail, Dublin. Maurice O&#x27;Neill and Richard Goss were the only people executed by the Irish state for a non-murder crime.

During 1941, the IRA&#x27;s hopes of a German invasion had faded and funding from the United States had been cut off. The IRA leadership were mostly interned within the Curragh Camp, where they were treated increasingly harshly, or on the run. Most internees accepted release on parole. The IRA remained barely active in Northern Ireland, but they were not a threat to the stability of Ireland. The IRA fostered links with German intelligence (the ) and Foreign Ministry, with men such as Francis Stuart travelling to Germany to talk, though these attempts were largely ineffectual due to a combination of and Foreign Ministry incompetence and IRA weakness. Germans also came to Ireland, the most notable of whom was Hermann Görtz, who was captured in possession of &quot;Plan Kathleen&quot;, an IRA plan that detailed a German-supported invasion of Northern Ireland. (See also Irish Republican Army–Abwehr collaboration.)

==Ireland and the United Kingdom 1939–1941==
There was a reluctance on the part of the British to accept the policy of Irish neutrality. Anthony Eden, Dominions
Secretary in the new British war cabinet, said &quot;we do not want formally to recognise Eire as neutral while Eire remains a member of the British Commonwealth&quot; as this he said would be in conflict with the &quot;constitutional theory of the indivisibility of the crown&quot;. A prevalent view in the UK was that Ireland was obliged to support the UK in the war. Winston Churchill said at the time that &quot;Southern Ireland is at war, but skulking&quot;.

After the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, Churchill became the British Prime Minister. The fall of France in June 1940 brought the war close to Ireland, as German troops occupied the French coastline across the Celtic Sea.

The United Kingdom was now the only major impediment to Germany. A major British concern was now whether Germany would invade Ireland. The British view was that the Irish Army was not powerful enough to resist an invasion for long enough for reinforcement from the UK, particularly with the IRA as a potential fifth column, and wished to be able to forestall this by stationing troops and ships within the Irish state. In addition, this view made the UK reluctant to provide military supplies because of the risk of their falling into German hands after an invasion. The Irish government&#x27;s view was that they would be more successful against the Germans than the states already occupied, and there could be no agreement for joint military measures while partition continued, and would not commit themselves beyond neutrality for the whole island should it end.

===Unification refused===
By June 1940, the British representative in Ireland, Maffey, was urging that &quot;the strategic unity of our island group&quot; should take precedence over Ulster Unionism, and Churchill was making clear that there should be no military action taken against Ireland. The British Minister for Health, Malcolm MacDonald, who had negotiated the 1938 trade agreement with Ireland whilst Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, was sent to Dublin to explore possibilities with de Valera. From these Chamberlain produced a six-point proposal that committed the UK government to a united Ireland and proposed the setting up of a joint body to effect this. A Joint Defence Council would be set up immediately and the State provided with military equipment. In return the State would join the Allies and intern all German and Italian aliens. Rejected by the Irish government, the proposal was then amended to strengthen the steps towards a united Ireland, and no longer requiring Ireland to join the war, but only to invite British forces to use Irish bases and ports. De Valera rejected the revised proposal on 4 July and made no counter proposal.

One reason for this would have been the difficult calculation of how damaging the inevitable split in Ireland would be if such a proposal was accepted. One of the main reasons was that the Irish Government thought that the UK would lose the war and did not want to be on the losing side: during the negotiations Walshe had produced two memoranda for de Valera (one entitled &quot;Britain&#x27;s Inevitable Defeat&quot;) predicting the isolation of Great Britain, the dismemberment of its empire, and finally its inevitable crushing by Germany. Walshe also wrote approvingly of the character of the Pétain government. Walshe&#x27;s memoranda affected de Valera, with him telling MacDonald that Great Britain &quot;could not destroy this colossal [German] machine&quot;. Nevertheless, from May 1940, Walshe and Col Liam Archer of Irish Military Intelligence discussed the defence of Ireland in the event of a German invasion with counterparts in Northern Ireland and a general strategic plan for UK military action &quot;Plan W&quot; across the border &quot;if invited&quot; was developed.

===Ports and shipping===

The great majority of Ireland&#x27;s trade was with the United Kingdom, and most of its supplies came from there. This created great difficulties for the Irish government as Germany tried to blockade the UK. Additionally the UK required Irish ships to operate under their &#x27;navicert&#x27; system. In September 1940, a joint agreement on trade, shipping and exports fell through—&quot;the main sticking point between the two sides was the prices on offer from Britain&quot; owing to the refusal to allow transshipment and repair facilities following German pressure, including the threat to blockade Ireland and the bombing of Ambrosetown and Campile in County Wexford. In the autumn of 1940, the threat of German invasion had receded, but relations between the UK and Ireland deteriorated, largely as a result of the increased losses of Allied shipping to U-boat attack. To try to prevent some of these losses, the UK wanted sea and air bases in western Ireland. On 5 November, in the House of Commons, Churchill complained:

The Irish government chose to interpret this sentence as a threat of invasion. Some sort of armed occupation was a real possibility (the UK had occupied Iceland in May 1940), but the balance of evidence is that there was never a serious threat. Large elements of the British cabinet and government and those of its allies were opposed to any armed intervention in Ireland; however, in late 1940 and early 1941, relations between the two countries did worsen. The British stopped informing Ireland of their order of battle in Northern Ireland, while the Irish Army drew up plans for defence against the British. The United Kingdom also started to restrict trade to Ireland, reasoning that if Ireland would not do anything to protect the lives of those bringing in supplies, it should at least share in the deprivations being felt in the UK. Relations between the two countries only really eased in the middle of 1941 with the invasion of the Soviet Union by Germany and an agreement to allow Irish immigration to Britain to work in the war industries, resulting in up to 200,000 Irish people doing so by 1945.

===The economy===
Only since 2000 has the wartime Irish economy been studied, away from the grander issues of diplomacy and warfare. Being still largely dependent on Britain for coal, manufactured goods and fuel oils, supplies of these were reduced after the fall of France in mid-1940, causing price inflation and a busy black market. It was said that &quot;the poor are like hunted rats looking for bread&quot;, as wheat supplies fell, and that the introduction of full rationing was &quot;seriously belated&quot;. Typhus reappeared and the government started planning for famine relief in late 1941. John Betjeman, the British press attaché in Dublin, reported &quot;No coal. No petrol. No gas. No electric. No paraffin. Guinness good.&quot; In March 1942 the government banned the export of beers, and decided that more wheat should be grown, and less barley. The prospect of a shortage of beer led on to barter deals whereby Britain supplied wheat suitable for making bread flour, and coal, and in return Ireland allowed the export of beers. &quot;These supplies were to keep neutral Ireland afloat during World War II and enable the continuance of Irish neutrality&quot;.

==Ireland and the neutral United States==
At the beginning of the Second World War, the United States President was Franklin Roosevelt. The United States was neutral, and Roosevelt&#x27;s actions were circumscribed by neutrality legislation; however, Roosevelt was a vehement anti-Nazi, an unequivocal supporter of the UK in the war, and personally close to Churchill. The US minister to Ireland was David Gray, a personal friend of Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor. De Valera saw the US as a bulwark against invasion from any party, while the US saw the support of Britain in the war as the priority, and so while supportive of Irish neutrality was sceptical of it extending over the whole island and wanted an arrangement to be made with the UK over ports, possibly through the leasing of them.

The sale of arms was a major issue. The declaration of war legally impeded the US from selling any arms to belligerents under the laws in force at the time; this led to Ireland being briefly considered as a possible conduit for arms sales to circumvent the law. However, in November 1939 Congress agreed to change the law to allow the sale of arms to all belligerents on a &quot;cash and carry&quot; basis. Nevertheless, the Irish government wanted the US to sell them arms. This was supported by Gray, and by the British government, but only if not at the expense of their own allocation. As a result, in 1940 all surplus US arms were sold to the UK and Canada.

The strong support of the UK by the Roosevelt administration led the Irish government to try to bolster anti-Roosevelt isolationist opinion in the November 1940 presidential election and a Christmas radio broadcast by de Valera to the US supporting isolationism. An attempt to influence Roosevelt&#x27;s special emissary, Wendell Willkie, on a visit to Great Britain and Ireland in January 1941, failed. In a further attempt to obtain arms from the US de Valera decided that Aiken should visit Washington. Gray supported the idea of a visit, but had doubts over whether Aiken was the right person to make it, and stressed that the Irish were only likely to obtain arms if they co-operated with the British Purchasing Commission. Aiken left Ireland in March 1941. For his St Patrick&#x27;s Day address, de Valera claimed that Ireland was under blockade from both sides and that neutrality protected Ireland from &quot;the hazards of imperial adventure&quot;. Aiken&#x27;s visit was disastrous. His anti-British views and, in American eyes, overestimation of Ireland&#x27;s military capabilities went across all the administration&#x27;s policies towards the war. As well as alienating Roosevelt and other members of the administration, he failed to use the letters of introduction to senior Democrats, including Eleanor Roosevelt, provided to him by Gray. Aiken spent the last seven weeks of his visit on what was seen as an anti-administration speaking tour, associating closely with isolationist opinion. The result was that the US would not sell any armaments to the State, and relations between the two countries significantly worsened, the US becoming even more unequivocal in its support of the UK. In October 1941 on receiving a note from the Irish government asking for its intentions with regard to Northern Ireland on the stationing of personnel associated with lend-lease, the US State Department referred them to the British government as Northern Ireland was, they insisted, part of the UK.

==Significant events==

===Belfast Blitz===

Meanwhile, Northern Ireland (as part of the United Kingdom) was at war and the Harland and Wolff shipyards in Belfast were among the strategic targets for German attack. The Luftwaffe carried out a bombing raid on Belfast on 7 April 1941; eight people died. On 15 April 1941, 180 Luftwaffe bombers attacked Belfast. There was only one RAF squadron and seven anti-aircraft batteries to defend Belfast. Over 200 tons of explosives, 80 landmines attached to parachutes and 800 firebomb canisters were dropped. Over 1,000 died and 56,000 houses (more than half of the city&#x27;s housing stock) were damaged leaving 100,000 temporarily homeless. At 4.30 Basil Brooke, Northern Ireland&#x27;s Minister of Commerce, asked de Valera for assistance. Within two hours, 13 fire tenders from Dublin, Drogheda, Dundalk and Dún Laoghaire were on their way to cross the Irish border to assist their Belfast colleagues. De Valera followed up with his &quot;they are our people&quot; speech. Although there was a later raid on 4 May, it was confined to the docks and shipyards.

===Dublin bombing===

On 2 January 1941, there were several minor German bombings of Irish territory, which led to three deaths in Borris, County Carlow and other incidents in Wexford, Dublin and at the Curragh. The public mood was already agitated, fearing a German invasion and the implications of the bombings added to the concern. So as not to antagonise the Germans further, the Irish authorities initially declined to confirm that the bombs were German. Public speculation, and IRA claims, that the bombs were British, or German but released by British aircraft, later prompted Irish Government denials.

On the night of 30/31 May 1941, Dublin&#x27;s Northside was the target of a Luftwaffe air raid. Thirty-eight were killed and seventy houses were destroyed on Summerhill Parade, North Strand and the North Circular Road. Unlike the earlier bombing incidents, there was no public speculation that the perpetrators were anyone other than the Luftwaffe. The Irish government promptly protested and Germany apologised, claiming that high winds or British interference with navigation signals were to blame. Churchill later conceded that the raids might have been the result of a British invention which distorted Luftwaffe radio guidance beams so as to throw their planes off course. Dublin had limited blackout regulations at the time, so the city was clearly visible, unlike British cities.

On 3 October, the German news agency announced that the German government would pay compensation, but only West Germany paid this after the war, using Marshall Aid money.

===The Allies and neutrality===
*In June 1940, to encourage the neutral Irish state to join with the Allies, Churchill indicated to de Valera that the United Kingdom would push for Irish unity, but believing that Churchill could not deliver, de Valera declined the offer. The British did not inform the Government of Northern Ireland that they had made the offer to the Irish government, and de Valera&#x27;s rejection was not publicised until 1970.
* When, in 1941, the Irish police discovered &quot;Operation Green&quot; in a residence where German agent Hermann Görtz had been staying, the Irish promptly passed copies to MI5 in London, who in turn forwarded them to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Belfast. Joint plans of action were then drawn up between the British and Irish intelligence services and military under Plan W.
* General McKenna, the Irish Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff, regularly visited British officers in Belfast and in 1942 twelve Irish officers undertook training with British special forces in Poyntzpass, County Armagh. Cooperation did not end there and also included the British signalling through GPO lines when it believed German planes were headed towards Ireland.
* From December 1940 onwards the Irish Government agreed to accept over 2,000 British women and children evacuated from London due to &quot;The Blitz&quot;. These evacuees included over two hundred children orphaned by the bombing.
* Attacks on Irish vessels, such as that on the &quot;Kerlogue&quot;, which the British had initially attributed to the Germans, but later admitted responsibility for and offered to pay compensation when fragments of British ammunition were discovered embedded in the ship. The ship had been attacked by aircraft of the No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron, after being mistaken for a French vessel.
* The mining of the St George&#x27;s Channel to within of the Irish coast at Dungarvan, and the use of Irish waters for British shipping traffic.
* London was informed when U-boats were sighted.
* The Donegal Corridor allowed British flying boats based on Lough Erne to take a short-cut over Irish territory when flying patrols over the Atlantic. The Catalina which located the when it was heading for France in 1941 was one example.
* Throughout the war, the Irish Air Corps shot down dozens of escaped British barrage balloons.
* A British armed trawler, the &quot;Robert Hastie&quot;, was stationed at Killybegs, from June 1941, for air/sea rescue (ASR) duties.
* The decision to go ahead with the D-day landings being decided on, in part, by a weather report from Blacksod Bay, County Mayo.
*Several Allied aircrew who crashed or landed in Ireland were interned though many were returned to Britain or Northern Ireland, especially after 1942. The final release was made in June 1944.
* De Valera protested vociferously to the American Government about its &quot;invasion of Ireland&quot; when U.S. troops had landed in Northern Ireland.
* On the death of Roosevelt, de Valera made arrangements for a commemoration service in St Mary&#x27;s (Catholic) Pro-Cathedral. The Ambassador, David Gray, said that he would not attend unless it was held in St. Patrick&#x27;s (Church of Ireland) Cathedral, Dublin. Walsh tried to contact the Ambassador, but was told that Gray was unavailable. Neither service was held. Since the Ambassador would be unavailable to receive condolences, de Valera sent his secretary to deliver his condolences rather than trying to deliver them in person. De Valera then instructed that flags be lowered to half-mast as a mark of respect to the late President.

===The Axis and neutrality===

* German pilots, aircrew and naval personnel who were discovered in Ireland were always interned and remained so for the duration of the conflict. One German prisoner was shot while attempting to escape from Oldcastle prison camp.
* In July 1940, three German agents were arrested outside Skibbereen after landing near Castletownshend, County Cork. The agents&#x27; mission had been to infiltrate Britain via Ireland.
* Ralph Ingersoll, who visited Britain in late 1940, wrote that year that &quot;Many informed people in Great Britain suspect that the [German] submarines are using bases in Ireland. There are many stories of submarine crews being seen in the cafés in Dublin out of uniform.&quot;
* The chief Abwehr spy in Ireland was Hermann Görtz. Approximately 12 spies were deployed, mostly with little success, including Günther Schütz, Ernst Weber-Drohl (a former circus strongman) and Henry Obed, an Indian.
* The activities of German agents in Ireland throughout the war years and their attempts to contact and court both IRA and disaffected Irish Army personnel. Many of these agents, if not all, were captured/exposed.
* The German ambassador at the German Legation in Dublin, Eduard Hempel, had his radio confiscated in 1943 to prevent him from passing information to his leaders. This is thought to have occurred at the insistence of the American forces stationed in Northern Ireland. Hempel had been relaying Irish Army strength and troop movements to Berlin throughout the war, and he is also thought to have relayed weather reports to the German battleships and in February 1942. The British military had been intercepting and logging his transmissions.
* The U-boat torpedo attack which sank the vessel on 19 May 1943. De Valera said that &quot;it was a wanton and inexcusable act. There was no possibility of a mistake, the conditions of visibility were good and the neutral markings on our ships were clear. There was no warning given.&quot;
* The &quot;North Strand Bombing&quot; on 31 May 1941 and others that took place in Malin, County Donegal on 5 May 1941, and Arklow on 1 June 1941.
* Repeated attempts to offer captured British weaponry to de Valera if he would side with the Germans.

==Relations with Germany==
In pursuit of its policy of neutrality, the Irish Government refused to close the German and Japanese embassies. In 1939, the German Government had very little intelligence on Ireland and Britain. This is because Hitler had hoped for a détente or alliance with Britain, whom he considered the &quot;natural allies&quot; of Nazi Germany. When concerted efforts to build a reliable picture of British military strength did begin around 1939–1940, efforts were first made to infiltrate spies to Britain via Ireland, but these attempts consistently failed (see Operation Lobster and Operation Seagull). The Abwehr also made attempts to foster intelligence gathering links with the IRA, but found that the IRA was in no condition to be of serious use — these attempts were to occur during the period 1939–1943. The German military also drew up plans detailing how an invasion of Ireland might take place. These plans were titled Plan Green and any invasion was to act as a diversionary attack in support of a main attack to conquer Britain titled Operation Sea Lion. Both of these plans were shelved by 1942. When US Army troops began to be stationed in Northern Ireland in 1942, Plan Green was reprinted because there was a fear amongst the German High Command (and the Irish Government) that the US Army might attempt an invasion of Ireland, following its occupation of Iceland (after the British invasion) and Greenland in 1941. These fears led to another German intelligence plan – Operation Osprey – but it was abandoned when the feared American invasion failed to take place.

The British also had a plan to occupy the entire island as a response to any attempted German invasion. They had always sought to privately reassure de Valera that any invasion by their troops would be by invitation only. This scheme was titled Plan W and intricate details were worked out with the Irish government and military over how to react to a German invasion. The Irish military shared details of their defences and military capabilities with the British and troops stationed in Northern Ireland. The reassurances from the British did not altogether console de Valera however, and he was frequently suspicious, while German forces still threatened Britain, that the British might invade the territory of the State. He did not know that the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Craigavon, was urging London to seize the port at Cobh, or that attempts had been made to split the consensus over the Neutrality policy. Concessions such as relaxing of the claim on Lough Swilly to allow British navy and air force patrols did go some way to easing the tension. As the war turned against Nazi Germany in their eastern campaign, and as the Abwehr became less and less effective, around 1943–1944, operations in the island of Ireland ceased to be of interest to the German Government and military and therefore the British. Overall, during the period the focus of de Valera was maintaining Irish neutrality. The Irish authorities&#x27; pursuit of an aggressive campaign of internment against the IRA, including raising the Local Security Force (LSF), executions, and aggressive action by Irish Military Intelligence (G2) meant that the activities of the German Legation in Dublin were supervised closely and attempts to infiltrate spies into the country were quickly discovered.

On the occasion of the death of Adolf Hitler, de Valera paid a controversial visit to Hempel to express sympathy with the German people over the death of the Führer. This action has been defended as proper given the state&#x27;s neutrality. Sir John Maffey, the British Representative, commented that de Valera&#x27;s actions were &quot;unwise but mathematically consistent&quot;. Douglas Hyde, Ireland&#x27;s president, also sent condolences, an action which enraged the United States minister as no similar action had taken place on the deaths of President Franklin D. Roosevelt or the former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George.

===Attitudes to the Holocaust===

Elements of Irish public opinion were markedly different in their treatment of the Axis powers. A &quot;Limerick Leader&quot; editorial in 1945 noted that, &quot;The campaign against war criminals is strangely confined to those who happen to fight on the wrong side.&quot; However it continued to say that Allied atrocities cannot excuse the monstrous barbarism of the Reich.

According to some sources, it appears that there was official indifference from the political establishment to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust during and after the war. This was despite De Valera having knowledge of the crimes committed against Jewish victims of the Holocaust as early as 1943. Other sources report that De Valera was so aware in 1942 and the government sought to secure the release of Jews from then. After the war had ended, Jewish groups had difficulty in getting refugee status for Jewish children – whilst at the same time, a plan to bring over four hundred Catholic children from the Rhineland encountered no difficulties. The Department of Justice explained in 1948 that:
It has always been the policy of the Minister for Justice to restrict the admission of Jewish aliens, for the reason that any substantial increase in our Jewish population might give rise to an anti-Semitic problem.

However, De Valera over-ruled the Department of Justice and the 150 refugee Jewish children were brought to Ireland in 1948. Earlier, in 1946, 100 Jewish children from Poland were brought to Clonyn Castle in County Meath by a London Jewish charity.

===Irish victims of the Holocaust===
Six Irish Jews are known to have been murdered in the Holocaust: Ettie Steinberg (born in Carpathian Ruthenia, lived in Dublin 1925–37), her Belgian-born husband Wojtech Gluck and their son Leon Gluck, who were all murdered at Auschwitz in 1942; Isaac Shishi, killed at Viekšniai, Lithuania in 1941; and siblings Ephraim and Jeanne (Lena) Saks, murdered at Auschwitz in 1944. Shishi and the Sakses were all born in Dublin but moved to continental Europe before war broke out. Six &quot;Stolpersteine&quot; commemorate them in Donore Avenue.

==The Emergency after the end of World War II==
De Valera&#x27;s reluctance to recognise a difference between World War II and previous European wars was illustrated by his reply to a radio broadcast by the British Prime Minister, Churchill on V-E Day. Churchill praised Britain&#x27;s restraint in not occupying Ireland to secure the Western Approaches during the Battle of the Atlantic:

De Valera replied to Churchill in another radio broadcast, which was popular when broadcast in Ireland:

===Punishment of Irish Army deserters===

Unlike other neutral states, Ireland did not introduce a general prohibition on its citizens opting for foreign enlistment during the war. However, one serious concern of government in this regard was the relatively high number of Irish soldiers deserting and leaving the jurisdiction. Estimates of between 4,000 and 7,000 members of the Irish armed forces deserted to join the armed forces of belligerent nations, the majority serving in the British Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy.

On 17 May 1945, Minister for Defence Oscar Traynor stated that he proposed introducing legislation which would deprive deserters of any right &quot;for a long time to come&quot; to employment paid for from public funds. The legislation in question was the Emergency Powers (No. 362) order which was passed on 8 August 1945. This punished those who had deserted during the Emergency in four ways:

* Deserters forfeited all pay and allowances for the period of their absence.
* They lost any rights to pensions they might have earned due to their years of service.
* They lost any entitlement to unemployment benefits normally available to former members of the Irish Army.
* For a period of seven years they could not qualify for any employment remunerated from public funds.

The Order only applied to personnel who had been called to active duty during the Emergency or who had enlisted &quot;for the duration&quot; of the Emergency and affected 4,000 men.

The government&#x27;s reasons for passing the order have been given as follows:

* To ensure that those personnel who had faithfully served the country in the defence forces had first chance of obtaining jobs with state and local authorities following demobilisation
* To deter future desertion
* To allow deserters to be dealt with in a cost-effective and expeditious way, rather than go the immense expense of court-martialling each man individually

On 18 October 1945 Thomas F. O&#x27;Higgins moved to annul the order. He did not condone desertion, but felt that the order was specifically awarding harsh punishment to those deserters who had served in the Allied forces. General Richard Mulcahy also spoke against the Order, disagreeing with the way in which it applied to enlisted men and not to officers. However, despite the arguments put forward by O&#x27;Higgins and Mulcahy, the Dáil voted in favour of the order.

An amnesty was enacted in the Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Act 2013, which admitted that the penalties were &#x27;now considered to have been unduly harsh&#x27; and offered an apology to those affected. The Minister of Defence, Alan Shatter, commented that it &#x27;was a tribute to how far we had come as a society that such a sensitive issue could get practically unanimous support from all sides in the Dáil&#x27;.

In April 1995 Taoiseach John Bruton paid tribute to those who &quot;volunteered to fight against Nazi tyranny in Europe, at least 10,000 of whom were killed while serving in British uniforms. In recalling their bravery, we are recalling a shared experience of Irish and British people. We remember a British part of the inheritance of all who live in Ireland.&quot;

==End of the Emergency==
The end of the Emergency was not declared until 1976, at the time of the Troubles. On 1 September 1976 a motion was passed in the Dáil &quot;that the national emergency created by the armed conflict referred to in the Resolutions, pursuant to the said Article, of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann of the 2nd September, 1939, has ceased to exist&quot;. The purpose of this was to allow the government to declare a new emergency, arising out of the conflict in Northern Ireland.

<text>Heinrich Kuhl (17 September 1797 – 14 September 1821) was a German naturalist and zoologist.

Kuhl was born in Hanau (Hesse, Germany). Between 1817 and 1820, he was the assistant of professor Th. van Swinderen, docent natural history at the University of Groningen in Groningen (the Netherlands). In 1817, he published a monograph on bats, and in 1819, he published a survey of the parrots, &quot;Conspectus psittacorum&quot;. He also published the first monograph on the petrels, and a list of all the birds illustrated in Daubenton&#x27;s &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot; and with his friend Johan Coenraad van Hasselt (1797–1823) &quot;Beiträge zur Zoologie und vergleichenden Anatomie&quot; (&quot;Contributions to Zoology and Comparative Anatomy&quot;) that were published at Frankfurt-am-Main, 1820. 

In 1820, he became assistant to Coenraad Jacob Temminck at the Leiden Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie. He then travelled to Java, then part of the colonial Netherlands East Indies, with his friend van Hasselt, to study the animals of the island, sending back to the museum at Leiden 200 skeletons, 200 mammal skins of 65 species, 2000 bird skins, 1400 fish, 300 reptiles and amphibians, and many insects and crustaceans.

He described many new species and new genera of amphibians and reptiles.

In 1821, he died in Buitenzorg (now Bogor) of a liver infection brought on by the climate and overexertion. He had been less than a year in Java. Johan van Hasselt continued his work collecting specimens, but died two years later. The partners are buried in a single grave in the Botanical Garden, Bogor, marked with a small column.

<doc id="588300" wikidata="Q577775" url="?curid=588300" title="Dino (marque)">
<text>Dino () was a marque best known for mid-engined, rear-drive sports cars produced by Ferrari from 1957 to 1976. The marque came into existence in late 1956 with a front-engined Formula Two racer powered by a brand new &quot;Dino&quot; V6 engine. The name Dino was used for some models with engines smaller than 12 cylinders, it was an attempt by the company to offer a relatively low-cost sports car. The Ferrari name remained reserved for its premium V12 and flat-12 models until 1976, when &quot;Dino&quot; was retired in favour of full Ferrari branding.

==History==

The name Dino honors Ferrari founder Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s late son, Alfredo &quot;Dino&quot; Ferrari, credited with designing the V6 engine used in the car. Along with engineer Vittorio Jano, Alfredo persuaded his father to produce a line of racing cars in the 1950s with V6 and V8 engines. The &quot;Dino&quot; script that adorns the badge and cylinder head covers was based on Alfredo&#x27;s own signature. The Dino models used Ferrari naming convention of displacement and cylinder count with two digits for the size of the engine in decilitres and the third digit to represent the number of cylinders, i.e. 246 being a 2.4-litre, 6-cylinder and 308 being a 3.0-litre, 8-cylinder.

==Single seaters==

===Dino 156 F2===

The first race car to ever bear the Dino marque badge was the 1957 Dino 156 F2 single seater intended for the Formula 2 series. It was powered by an all-new, front-mounted, 65° &quot;Dino&quot; V6 co-designed by Vittorio Jano and named in memory of Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s late son, Alfredo &quot;Dino&quot; Ferrari.
The new V6 engine, first built and tested in 1956, had to adhere to 1.5 litre, Formula 2 regulations.

Total capacity was (bore of 70 mm and stroke of 64.5 mm) and power output was at 9000 rpm with a 10:1 compression ratio. The fuel system consisted of three Weber 38DCN carburettors and used regular fuel. The valvetrain was of a twin overhead camshafts per bank type with two valves per cylinder and single spark plugs.

As per the naming convention, the 1.5-litre, 6-cylinder car was named 156 and made its debut at the Naples Grand Prix in 1957. The chassis was made of steel tubes with independent front suspension, a de Dion rear axle, and Houdaille shock absorbers. Only one example was produced: s/n 0011. Its drivers included Luigi Musso, Maurice Trintignant, and Peter Collins.

Musso managed to score third place at the time of its debut at the Naples GP and Maurice Trintignant won the Coupe de Vitesse. Musso later took two second place finishes at the Modena GP (in both heats).

The engine was upgraded to 1860 cc in 1957 (later 2195 cc), to 85 x 71 mm at 8500 rpm in 1958 for Formula One specification {and renamed Ferrari 246 F1 ) and in 1959. In 1960 the engine was updated with a lower V-degree (65º&gt;60º), a shorter stroke {73 x 58.8 mm for 1476.6 cc), and a single overhead camshaft.


===Dino 166 F2===
A change in Formula One rules for the 1966 season brought changes to Formula 2 as well. New homologation requirements meant that at least 500 production units of the same engine block were to be produced. Ferrari turned to Fiat to produce a more affordable sports car for this purpose. Fiat produced two models with the &quot;Dino&quot; engine in coupé and spider form under the name Fiat Dino. For the 1967 European Championship season Ferrari was able to field a new car, the Dino 166 F2, with a rear-mounted, longitudinal 65° &quot;Dino&quot; V6 engine. The car made its debut at the Racing Car Show in Turin in February 1967.

====Specifications====
The new powerplant had of total capacity with a bore of 86 mm and a very short stroke at only 45.8 mm with a Heron type 3 valves head. A single split overhead camshaft per bank actuated three valves per cylinder: two inlet directly by the camshaft and one exhaust through a rocker. In 1968, the cylinder measures changed to 79.5 x 53.5 mm () with an 11:1 compression ratio.
In 1969, the power grew from at 10,000 rpm to at 11,000 rpm. Fuel feed was by Lucas indirect injection and ignition by Magneti Marelli transistorized twin-plugs, later changed to a single ignition.
The chassis was a semi-monocoque with all-independent suspension and disc brakes. Seven cars were built, of which three were later converted for the Tasman race series with engines enlarged to 2.4 litres.

====Racing====
The cars were raced by Ernesto Brambilla, Chris Amon, Andrea de Adamich, and Derek Bell. Their first F2 wins were the 1968 Hockenheim race and later the GP Roma at Vallelunga.


===Dino 246 Tasmania===
For the 1968 season of Formula One, Ferrari had returned to the V12 engined cars. This created a need to pursue other racing venues for their already existing projects. The Tasman Series for cars up to 2500 cc was just that venue and the Dino 246 Tasmania was just such a car, converted from the Dino 166 Formula 2 basis with the engine enlarged to 2.4 L to meet the requirements without overstretching the engine.

====Specifications====
The new displacement of was achieved thanks to of bore and stroke. Internal dimensions were identical to that of the 246 F1-66. At an 11.5:1 compression ratio, power output was a healthy at 8900 rpm. Already standard on 65° &quot;Dino&quot; V6 twin overhead camshafts per bank, and a novelty: four valves per cylinder. The same as its predecessor, the chassis was a semi-monocoque with all-independent suspension and disc brakes.

====Racing====
Only three cars were made and raced with success between 1968 and 1971, mainly in hands of Chris Amon and Graeme Lawrence. The Tasman Series was particularly suited for the Dino Tasmania. Chris Amon won two races in the 1968 Tasman Series, including the 1968 New Zealand Grand Prix before going on to dominate the 1969 Tasman Series by scoring four wins, including wins both blue ribbon events, the 1969 New Zealand Grand Prix and the 1969 Australian Grand Prix, and winning the Drivers Championship. In 1969 Amon was aided by Derek Bell in the other Scuderia Veloce car with enough points for fourth place. For the 1970 Tasman Series the winning car was handed over to Graeme Lawrence who won only one race but, with four other podium finishes, won the championship.

==Sports racing cars==

===Dino 196 S===
The first sports racing car under Dino marque was 2.0 L &quot;Dino&quot; V6-engined Dino 196 S. The first example, s/n 0740, was made in 1958 and had a 65° DOHC configuration as found in its Formula Two predecessor and is sometimes referred to as 206 S. The other, s/n 0776 from 1959, had its engine redesigned as a 60° SOHC version. A possible third car was immediately upgraded to 3.0 L specification and never raced it its two-litre form. All early Dino sports cars actually had Ferrari badges on the front.

====Specifications====
Both cars&#x27; engines had of total capacity from of bore and stroke. Both used the same carburettor setup with three 42DCN Webers, resulting in the same power output. The differing factors were the RPM range: 7200 for the DOHC, 7800 for both the SOHC engine and a twin spark plug arrangement for the DOHC-variant. Both cars were created on a tubular chassis with independent front suspension and live rear axle. The first car received Scaglietti coachwork, but was soon rebodied by Fantuzzi, who also bodied the second car. Their style was reminiscent of a Ferrari 250 TR and was often referred to as a &#x27;smaller Testa Rossa.&#x27;

====Racing====
The first Dino 196 S made its debut at the Goodwood Sussex Trophy and was driven to second place by Peter Collins. After being converted to SOHC form, it scored silver for the 1959 Le Mans Test and a single victory at Coppa Sant Ambroeus. The last race for this car was the 1959 Pontedecimo-Giovi hillclimb in which another second place was achieved before the car was dismantled at the factory. The other Dino had a much longer career. In 1959, driven by Ricardo Rodriguez it finished fourth and second in a couple of races at the Governor&#x27;s Trophy, Nassau. The following year the car was entered in the Targa Florio and finished seventh overall.

====Replicas====
Numerous replicas had been made of this model. Approximately twelve examples based on a tubular chassis with handcrafted aluminium bodywork in Fantuzzi spider style. Cars were created either by anonymous builders or by Vincenzo Marciano, an Italian private constructor. Power came from 2.4 L four-cam V6 Fiat Dino road car engine mated to a 5-speed ZF transmission.

===Dino 296 S===

The second Dino-badged sports racing model was the 1958 Dino 296 S. Only a single example, s/n 0746, was made with a near 3-litre V6 engine. It had a 65° configuration with twin overhead camshafts per bank and two spark plugs per cylinder. Total capacity was thanks to internal measurements of 85 x 87 mm. With three Weber 45DCN carburettors, power was an impressive at 7600 rpm.

A tubular steel chassis with independent front suspension, de Dion rear axle and drum brakes was clothed with a spider Fantuzzi bodywork as seen on its siblings from the same period. The fuel tank had 177 litres capacity.

Its first outing was in England at Silverstone Circuit in May 1958, where Mike Hawthorn scored third place. After just a single race the car was converted into an experimental 250 Testa Rossa model and raced in June, the same year, at the 1000km Nürburgring, where Wolfgang von Trips and Olivier Gendebien finished third overall. The model was further raced by Ricardo Rodriguez in the Bahamas and United States.
===Dino 246 S===

For the 1960 season, Ferrari presented a new derivative of their V6-engined sports racing car, the Dino 246 S. Its engine was closely related to that found in the Ferrari 246 F1 but designed as a 60°, chain-driven, single overhead camshaft per bank variant. Only two examples were ever created, s/n 0778 and 0784, the latter known as the &#x27;high tail&#x27; spider.

====Specifications====
Internal measurements of 85 x 71 mm and resulting capacity of 2.4 L () were identical to the Formula One sibling. At a 9.8:1 compression ratio with three Weber 42DCN carburettors, rated power output was at 7500 rpm. The engine used a single spark plug per cylinder served by a single coil. This would be the last Dino sports racing car with a front-mounted engine.

The chassis was constructed out of steel tubes with independent front suspension and a live axle at the rear. The wheelbase was . Bodies were designed and executed by Fantuzzi, both in the style previously seen on the Dino cars, but s/n 0784 was rebodied as a &#x27;high tail&#x27; spider before 1961 12 Hours of Sebring race. Brakes were of a disc type all-round.

====Racing====
The Dino 246 S debuted in January 1960 at the 1000km Buenos Aires but failed to finish due to ignition problems. Its first success came when both cars were entered in the 1960 Targa Florio, finishing second and fourth overall and first and second in the &#x27;Sports 3.0&#x27; class. Phil Hill and Wolfgang von Trips drove the car that finished second. Ludovico Scarfiotti, Willy Mairesse and Giulio Cabianca were in the other car. In 1960, s/n 0778 was recreated at the factory after a pit stop fire damage at the 1000km Nürburgring. Both cars continued their later careers in the United States. The &#x27;high tail&#x27; spider driven by Jim Hall and George Constantine scored sixth place and won its &#x27;Sports 2.5&#x27; class at the 1961 12 Hours of Sebring.

==Sports prototypes==

=== Ferrari SP series ===
The Ferrari Dino SP was a series of Italian sports prototype racing cars produced by Ferrari from 1961 through 1962. This first series of Dino-engined sports prototypes included the 246 SP, 196 SP, 286 SP, 248 SP, and 268 SP; distinguished from each other by use of V6 and V8 engines in different displacements. All shared a similar body and chassis with a rear mid-engine layout, a first for a Ferrari sports car. Major racing accolades include the 1962 European Hill Climb Championship, two overall Targa Florio victories, in 1961 and 1962, and &quot;1962 Coupe des Sports&quot; title.

At first the SP-series used Vittorio Jano-designed, V6 &quot;Dino&quot; engines in both SOHC 60° and DOHC 65° forms. Later, Ferrari introduced a new SOHC 90° V8 engine designed by Carlo Chiti. All used dry sump lubrication and were mated to a 5-speed manual transmission.

After 1963, these Ferrari SP models were no longer used by Scuderia Ferrari and passed into the ownership of private individuals or independent racing teams. They were succeeded by the Dino 166 P in 1965.

===Dino 166 P===

The 1965 Dino 166 P was created by Ferrari to compete in endurance racing with categories up to 1600 cc or even 2000 cc. One chassis that raced, s/n 0834, sported brand new all-aluminium berlinetta bodywork inspired by the Ferrari P-series of cars but with smaller dimensions. It was designed and built by Piero Drogo&#x27;s Carrozzeria Sports Cars in Modena. This new style would be carried over to the rest of the Dino race car family. This was the first Ferrari-made sports prototype to bear the rectangular &#x27;Dino&#x27; badge on the front of the car and also the first to be bodied with a closed body. A second car, s/n 0842, never raced and was converted into the works prototype of the Dino 206 S.

====Specifications====
The engine, mounted in the rear, displaced 1.6 L () from of bore and stroke. The compression ratio was 11.5:1 and with three Weber 40DCN/2 carburettors and twin spark plugs per cylinder, resulting power was at 9000 rpm. From this moment on, every Dino race and road car would have a 65°, twin overhead camshafts per bank with two valves per cylinder engine. As a race engine it also used dry sump lubrication.

A tubular steel chassis now received full independent suspension, front and rear. The wheelbase was long. Disc brakes all-round were standard at the time. The whole car weighed only dry.

====Racing====
After a failed attempt at the 1000km Monza in May 1965, the following month the 166 P was entered into the GP Roma on the Vallelunga track. Giancarlo Baghetti won it outright, two laps ahead of a Porsche. The same month Lorenzo Bandini with Nino Vaccarella scored a respectable fourth place overall and second in &#x27;Prototype 2.0&#x27; class at the 1000km Nürburgring, ahead of cars with much bigger engine capacity. Just after failing to finish the 1965 24 Hours of Le Mans race due to engine problems, the 166 P was developed into the Dino 206 SP with completely open bodywork and a bigger 2.0 L engine.
===Dino 206 SP===
The Dino sports prototype model that followed the 166 P was the Dino 206 SP. The first example was an exact conversion from is predecessor, still with the same s/n 0834, but with new barchetta body and a bigger 2.0 L engine. Designed specifically for the European hillclimb events, the car is also referred to simply as the Dino 206 P. A second car, s/n 0840, was the basis for the concept car, Dino Berlinetta Speciale by Pininfarina.

====Specifications====
The biggest change was the engine enlargement to 2.0 L () so that car could make full use of the 2000 cc category limit. The engine was redesigned by Ferrari engineer Franco Rocchi for Formula Two use. This displacement would be carried over not only to the 206 S, the succeeding model, but also to the Fiat and Dino road cars as well. The larger displacement was due to bigger bore, now at , and stroke was the same as before. Power rose to at 9000 rpm, with all of the remaining specifications the same apart for all-new Lucas fuel injection.

All of the chassis and suspension configuration was carried over without change. The 206 SP received new low-slung barchetta bodywork that was a whole lower, now at . Only a small, wrap-around windscreen and a single roll bar protruded above the bodywork. Due to this mass reduction the overall dry weight of the car measured up to , that is more than a saving. All this was with twisty hillclimb competition in mind. Later the car was rebodied in style with the 206 S and received similar roll bar-roof treatment.

====Racing====
The new car debuted at its first hillclimb in Trento-Bondone in 1965, winning it outright in the hands of Ludovico Scarfiotti, despite being described as &quot;an absurdly dramatic climb&quot;. He also won three more races in a row: the Cesana-Sestriere hillclimb, the Freiburg-Schauinsland hillclimb and Ollon-Villars. At the Gaisberg hillclimb in August 1965 Scarfiotti finished fifth but still won the European Hill Climb Championship. This was his second championship for Ferrari, the first he won back in 1962 in a Ferrari 196 SP. In 1967 the 206 SP was lent to Scuderia Nettuno that entered the car in the Targa Florio, placing fourth overall and third in the &#x27;Prototype 2.0&#x27; class, driven by Vittorio Venturi and Jonathan Williams. Venturi then placed third in yet another hillclimb event at Monte Erice. Leandro &quot;Cinno&quot; Terra entered the 206 SP for the 1969 Targa Florio, but finished in a distant 25th place. Its last period race was the Coppa Collina, where it finished in second place.
===Dino 206 S===

The last of the Dino prototype sports car models was produced in 1966–1967. 18 examples were made with Group 4 category homologation in mind. Still powered by 2.0 L () engine based on the 206 SP powerplant. Some received experimental 3-valve heads and Lucas fuel injection.

==Concept cars==
Ferrari built and presented numerous design concepts and prototypes to overcame styling and engineering challenges derived from a new engine layout of a road-car. As many as six different Dino prototypes were built between 1965 and 1967. The new and revolutionary design would spawn whole generations of Dino and Ferrari mid-engine road cars.

===Dino Berlinetta Speciale===
The first Dino-badged concept car was presented by Ferrari and Pininfarina in 1965. It was a mid-engined, two-seater called Dino Berlinetta Speciale. The work started in March 1965. The car was designed by Aldo Brovarone who created the conceptual plans that would in the future form a basic characteristics of the production Dino cars. The project was managed by Leonardo Fioravanti, and its directors included Sergio Pininfarina. They were all involved in creating and packaging this concept car and ultimately the production version, Dino 206 GT, that would also be partially credited to Fioravanti as its co-designer along Brovarone. Also in 1965, Brovarone designed the Alfa Romeo Giulia 1600 Sport concept car using the similar stylistic cues but realised on a front-engined car.

The Berlinetta Speciale was built on a competition &quot;Type 585&quot; tubular chassis, derived from the Dino 206 SP sports prototype, with its engine mounted longitudinally. This first Dino concept car was finished in record time by October 1965, just before the 52nd Paris Motor Show. It was built on a spare chassis s/n 0840, from Scuderia Ferrari. In November of the same year, it was exhibited at the Turin Motor Show and at the New York Motor Show in April 1966.

The short-wheelbase car had a very streamlined body with prominent wheel arches. The front of the car was very low and incorporated headlights covered with plexiglass. The elongated side air-intakes that channelled air for rear brakes cooling became a signature element of the marque range. The rear window was curved round the inclined rear pillars and were also part of the quarter-light windows. Whole rear section of the car could be opened to reveal an engine bay and spare wheel. The car and the cockpit were finished in Ferrari red and the non-adjustable seats in cream colour. The pedal box could be moved to conform to the driver. Same as on a competition car, the steering wheel was mounted on the right.

The Dino Berlinetta Speciale was sold on Artcurial auction in 2017 for €4,390,400.

===Ferrari 365 P Berlinetta Speciale===
The Ferrari 365 P Berlinetta Speciale is both seen as a scaled up version of the original Dino and its predecessor, presented at the same time as the other Dino prototypes, in 1966. The Ferrari Berlinetta Speciale was also known as &quot;Tre-Posti&quot; for its unique seating design. Aldo Brovarone of Pininfarina was also credited with this design, but the car featured a triple seating with the driver situated in the center. Also the overall size was larger to accommodate bigger V12 powerplant.

===Dino Berlinetta GT===

In 1966, Pininfarina designed an evolution over the previous concept car, the Dino Berlinetta GT prototype. It was presented in November 1966, at the 48th Turin Motor Show and previewed the production Dino road car that would be presented a year later at the same venue.

The prototype had three round taillights mounted on a chrome background and turn signals below the front grille. The entire body was longer than the production car as was its wheelbase at . The reason was that the 2.0-liter V6 was mounted longitudinally in the middle of the car. The engine however was no longer a competition unit, rather a road-car sourced &quot;Type 135B&quot;. The same as before, the engine was accessed by a large lid hinged on the roof of the car that incorporated the buttresses and rear convex window. The side air intakes were elongated, featuring chrome bars that also functioned as door handles. The chassis was also different from the previous concept, now a &quot;Type 599&quot;. The chassis number 00106 was assigned in 1967 from the road car sequence.

The yellow-painted Dino Berlinetta GT prototype was sold in 2018 at Gooding &amp; Company auction for US$3,080,000.
===Dino Berlinetta Competizione===

At the 1967 Frankfurt Motor Show, Pininfarina and Ferrari unveiled the Dino Berlinetta Competizione. It was a concept car designed by a young designer, Paolo Martin. It was an exclusive design study as well as a working prototype but was never intended to enter production. The concept was based on a Dino 206 S racing chassis s/n 034, one of the last of the series. The engine was a &quot;Type 231/B&quot; with an improved 3-valve heads.

Some of the design cues were influenced by the existing Dino competition cars. The whole creative process took no longer than four months. The overall rounded shape was later modified with addition of the front and rear spoilers. The gullwing doors featured a curved glass that would slide into the door structure.

==Road cars==

The Dino road cars marque was created to market a lower priced, more affordable sports car capable of taking on the Porsche 911. Ferrari&#x27;s expensive V12s well exceeded the 911 in both performance and price. Enzo Ferrari did not want to diminish his exclusive brand with a cheaper car, so the Dino was created.

Although a mid-engine layout was common in the world of sports car racing at the time, adapting it to a production car was quite daring. Such a design placed more of the car&#x27;s weight over the driven wheels, and allowed for a streamlined nose, but led to a cramped passenger compartment and more challenging handling. Lamborghini created a stir in 1966 with its mid-engined Miura, but Enzo Ferrari felt a mid-engine Ferrari would be unsafe in the hands of his customers. Eventually he partially relented and a mid-engined Dino concept car was built for the 1965 Paris Motor Show. Response to the radically styled car was positive, so Ferrari allowed it to go into production, rationalizing the lower power of the V6 engine would result in a more manageable car.

===Dino 206 GT===
The first road-going Dino was the 1967 Dino 206 GT, designed by Aldo Brovarone at Pininfarina.

The 206 GT used a transverse-mounted 2.0 L all-aluminium 65-degree V6 engine, with at 8,000 rpm, the same used in the Fiat Dino.
The 206 GT frame featured an aluminium body, full independent suspension, and all round disc brakes.
152 were built in total between 1967 and 1969, in left hand drive only.
===Dino 246 GT and GTS===
In 1969 the 206 GT was superseded by the more powerful Dino 246 GT. The 246 GT was powered by an enlarged V6 engine, producing at 7,600 rpm in European specification. Initially available as a fixed-top &quot;GT&quot; coupé, a targa topped &quot;GTS&quot; was also offered after 1971.

Other notable changes from the 206 were the body, now made of steel instead of aluminium, and a longer wheelbase than the 206. Three series of the Dino 246 GT were built, with differences in wheels, windshield wiper coverage, and engine ventilation. Dino 246 production numbered 2,295 GTs and 1,274 GTSs, for a total production run of 3,569.
===Dino 308/208 GT4===
The 308 GT4 was produced from 1973 to April 1980. Initially branded &quot;Dino&quot;, the 308 GT4 was Ferrari&#x27;s first V8-engined production automobile.

The 308 was a 2+2 with a wheelbase of . The 308 was designed by Bertone; with its angular wedge shape, it looked quite different from the 206/246 from which it was derived.

The 308 GT4 had a , 90-degree V-8 with twin overhead camshafts per bank and two valves per cylinder. Fuel was fed by four Weber 40DCNF carburettors which produced at 7700 rpm. The V-8 block and heads were made of an aluminium alloy. The compression ratio was 8.8:1. The American version had a timing change and catalytic converters; it produced a more modest . For the 208 GT4, an Italian market model, manufacturer claimed . The GT4 weighed dry.

The 308 GT4 wore the Dino badge until May 1976, when it finally got the Ferrari &quot;Prancing Horse&quot; badge on the hood, wheels, and the steering wheel.

<text>Hugo Emil Alfvén (; 1 May 18728 May 1960) was a Swedish composer, conductor, violinist, and painter. Alfvén was one of Sweden&#x27;s principal composers. His &quot;Swedish Rhapsody”, written when he was 31, is still one of the best-known pieces of Swedish music. After extensive European travels to develop his musical skills, Alfvén taught composition, before conducting choirs and orchestras. In 1954 he made the first Swedish classical stereo recordings. Hugo Alfvén’s extensive musical archive is held at Uppsala University, where he was music director for twenty nine years.

== Career ==

=== Violinist ===
Alfvén was born in Stockholm, Sweden, and studied at the Royal College of Music (Kungliga Musikhögskolan) from 1887 to 1891 with the violin as his main instrument while receiving lessons from Lars Zetterquist. He also took private composition lessons from Johan Lindegren, a leading counterpoint expert. At the same time he played the violin at the Royal Opera in Stockholm 1890-1892. 

=== Conductor ===
Starting in 1897, Alfvén travelled much of the next ten years in Europe. He studied violin technique in Brussels with César Thomson and learned conducting in Dresden with Hermann Ludwig Kutzschbach. In 1903-4 he was formally professor of composition at the Royal Conservatory, Stockholm. From 1910 Alfvén was &quot;Director musices&quot; (music director) at the University of Uppsala (a post he held until 1939). There he also directed the male voice choir Orphei Drängar (or &#x27;O.D.&#x27;) (until 1947). He conducted in festivals at Uppsala (1911), Dortmund (1912), Stuttgart (1913), Gothenburg (1915), and Copenhagen (1918–1919). He toured Europe as a conductor throughout his life. He received a Ph.D. &quot;honoris causa&quot; from Uppsala in 1917 and became a member of the Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm in 1908. Alfvén recorded some of his orchestral music in stereo late in 1954 (the first classical stereo recordings made in Sweden); the recordings were issued on LP in the U.S. by Westminster Records. A three-CD collection of Alfvén&#x27;s recordings as a conductor has been issued.

== Music ==

Alfvén became known as one of Sweden&#x27;s principal composers of his time, together with his contemporary Wilhelm Stenhammar. Alfvén&#x27;s music is in a late Romantic idiom. His orchestration is skillful and colorful, reminiscent of that of Richard Strauss. Like Strauss, Alfvén wrote a considerable amount of program music. Some of Alfvén&#x27;s music evokes the landscape of Sweden.

Among his works are a large number of pieces for male voice choir, five symphonies and three orchestral &quot;Swedish Rhapsodies.&quot; The first of these rhapsodies, &quot;Midsommarvaka&quot;, is his best known piece.

Alfvén&#x27;s five symphonies, the first four of them now several times recorded (with another cycle in progress), give a picture of the composer&#x27;s musical progress. The first, in F minor, his Op. 7 from 1897, is an early work, tuneful in a standard four movements. The second, in D major (1898–99), his Op. 11 (and in a way his graduation piece, as recounted at ) concludes with a substantial, even powerful chorale-prelude and fugue in D minor. The third symphony, in E major, Op. 23 (1905), also in four movements, more mature in technique though light in manner, was inspired by a trip to Italy. The fourth symphony, in C minor, Op. 39 of 1918–9 &quot;From the Outermost Skerries&quot; (there is also a tone-poem, &quot;A Legend of the Skerries&quot;), is a symphony in one forty-five-minute movement using wordless voices, inspired by Carl Nielsen&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia Espansiva&quot;. The 5th, in A minor, begun 1942, is one of the composer&#x27;s last works, and has been recorded only twice in full (recordings and performances of the 5th, while rare enough, are usually of its quarter-hour first movement).

Naxos Records and BIS Records among others have either collections or groups of individual recordings covering all of his symphonies and a range of his works. &quot;Brilliant Classics&quot; has licensed and re-issued the 5-CD set from BIS devoted to Alfvén that includes the symphonies and other orchestral works.

=== Swedish Rhapsody No. 1 ===

The first rhapsody – &quot;Swedish Rhapsody No. 1&quot;, also known as &quot;Midsommarvaka&quot; (&quot;Midsummer Vigil&quot;) – was written in 1903 and is often simply called the &quot;Swedish Rhapsody.&quot; It is the best-known piece composed by Alfvén and also one of the best-known pieces of music in Sweden.

== Painter and writer ==
Alfvén&#x27;s contributions were multi-dimensional and also included painting and writing. He was a talented watercolorist and once thought to devote himself entirely to painting. He also was a gifted writer. His four-volume autobiography has been called &quot;captivating&quot; and provides significant insight into the musical life of Sweden, in which Alfvén was a central figure for well over half a century.

== Personal life ==

Alfvén was born in Stockholm, Sweden, on 1 May 1872. 
He was married three times. His first marriage (1912–1936) was to the Danish painter Marie Triepcke (1867–1940), who had previously been married to the painter Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909). After his divorce from Marie in 1936, he married Carin Wessberg (1891–1956). They were together for two decades (1936–1956) before she died. He married Anna Lund (1891–1990) in 1959. 
He died on 8 May 1960 in Falun, Sweden, just after his 88th birthday. 

His daughter Margita Alfvén became a film star in the silent era. His nephew Hannes Alfvén received the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics.

== List of musical works ==
When Hugo Alfvén died, his musical archive was handed over to the University of Uppsala and Jan Olof Rudén was then responsible for filing Alfvén&#x27;s music, trying to create order in the chaos of a total of 214 works. The works of the composer were officially filed and opus numbered to a total of 54 musical compositions. Alfvén&#x27;s works were filed according to a Rudén number along with a catalog for an opus number. Rudén has thereby attempted to classify based on other data. There still exist documents to which neither date nor Opus/Rudén number has been accorded.

In the following works below, it may be that some opus numbers contain more than one title. Opus number 48 was never used or at least recovered.

<doc id="588308" wikidata="Q15730468" url="?curid=588308" title="Faxlore">
<text>Faxlore is a sort of folklore: humorous texts, folk poetry, folk art, and urban legends that are circulated, not by word of mouth, but by fax machine. Xeroxlore or photocopylore is similar material circulated by photocopying.

The first use of the term xeroxlore was in Michael J. Preston&#x27;s essay &quot;Xerox-lore&quot;, 1974. &quot;Photocopylore&quot; is perhaps the most frequently encountered name for the phenomenon now, because of trademark concerns involving the Xerox Corporation. The first use of this term came in &quot;A Dictionary of English Folklore&quot; by Jacqueline Simpson and Steve Roud.

==Material circulated in faxlore==
Some faxlore is relatively harmless. Cartoons and jokes often circulate as faxlore, the poor graphic quality becoming worse with each new person who resends the joke to the next recipient. Because faxlore and xeroxlore is the (mis)appropriation of technology owned by the employer, much humorous faxlore is mildly subversive of the workplace and its values. Like email and chain letters, office technology has given new life to various forms of practical jokes, urban legends, and folklore. The items are often office-related, such as spoof agenda for meetings, spurious descriptions of ridiculous training programs that all staff will allegedly be required to attend, and so on. Names may be whited out and replaced with someone in the office, making it a joke on a particular person, or details may be altered making an item more topical.

The semi-traditional lists of reasons &quot;why a cucumber is better than a man&quot; or &quot;why a beer is better than a woman&quot; often circulate as faxlore, as has the well known mock German variations of the &quot;Blinkenlights&quot; poster. Another commonly circulated text contains ethnic humor; a typical version goes:

Heaven is where the police are British, the lovers French, the mechanics German, the chefs Italian, and it is all organized by the Swiss.

Hell is where the police are German, the lovers Swiss, the mechanics French, the chefs British, and it is all organized by the Italians.

Materials of this sort have existed from the beginnings of duplicating technologies. World War II era blueprints exist of drawings of female nudes with their body parts labeled as if they were the parts of airplanes. With the widespread adoption of photocopying, amateur duplication of this sort of material became available to a much larger social base. Cartoons and other amateur materials were distributed in the workplace, usually in violation of managerial restrictions on the use of office supplies, and often in disregard of copyright law.

Later, during the early 1990s, the widespread adoption of telecopiers made it possible to duplicate these materials remotely. The use of a fax machine to duplicate these materials also changed the emphases of their subjects; various alarms and urban legends were propagated to distant readers over the telephone lines. This use of fax has been somewhat supplanted by email as that technology became more widely used and embedded in the culture; the sort of urban legends that once circulated by fax are now likely to appear as email hoaxes. Specific computer related alarms are the subject of virus hoaxes; email makes forwarding of texts relatively easy, and the frightening nature of the revelation makes it seem important to pass along, despite any doubts the sender might have.

==Faxlore and urban legends==
Other sorts of faxlore have had more serious consequences. A number of more notorious urban legends have circulated in faxlore. The notorious &quot;Blue Star Acid&quot; hoax is one well known example.

The &quot;lights out&quot; hoax, which claimed that people who were driving in the dark with their headlights out might be gang members, and that those who flashed their headlights at these drivers might be marked for murder as part of a gang initiation, was another hoax that was widely circulated as faxlore. The poor graphic quality of the frequently re-sent faxes, which often were made out to appear to have originated with the police department of a distant city, only made these hoaxes seem more credible.

==Legal aspects==
In the United States, collections of supposedly sinister symbols have been circulated among school administrators and police departments; in the 1980s these symbols were frequently alleged to be &quot;Satanic symbols&quot;, and in the 1990s they were alleged to be &quot;gang symbols&quot;. Political or religious symbols, like the peace symbol, the Star of David, the Rosary, the ankh, or the pentagram were mingled with other cryptic or fanciful symbols in these faxed and recirculated sheets, and the entire collection was condemned.

On the authority of these anonymous, hard-to-trace, and impossible-to-cross-examine sources, school administrators sometimes acted to ban the wearing of Stars of David and similar symbols of minority religions. Typically, no compiler or author is given for the collection of symbols, though frightening descriptions are often given about their &quot;secret meaning.&quot; A number of civil liberties lawsuits were filed over actions taken by school administrators who took these anonymous sources seriously.

A similar claim that the Procter &amp; Gamble logo was a &quot;satanic symbol&quot; was linked in the 1980s to the activity of several Amway distributors, Amway being one of Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s competitors; the hoax was spread by fax, photocopier, and later by voice mail and email. Another occasional hoax claims that clothing and memorabilia of various universities or sports teams are &quot;gang symbols&quot;.

== Growing obsolescence ==

With the rise of the Internet, media such as World Wide Web, email, instant messaging, and social networking sites are now available to quickly and widely spread the sort of material that formerly circulated as faxlore. The hoax warnings of things such as dire and terrible computer viruses that still occasionally circulate, carry on one tradition of the bogus cautionary tale that used to circulate as faxlore, now known as &quot;copypasta&quot; (an altered compound of common computer functions copy and paste).

<text>The Ferrari 328 GTB and GTS (Type F106) are mid-engine V8, two-seat sports cars created by Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari. It was the successor to the Ferrari 308 GTB and GTS. While mechanically still based on the 308, modifications were made to the body, chassis, and engine, most notably an increase in engine displacement to 3.2 L for increased power and torque output. The 328 is still considered by some enthusiasts to be one of the most reliable and functional Ferraris; unlike other models, much of its maintenance can be performed without lowering the engine from the vehicle. In 1989, the 328 was succeeded by the 348.

&quot;GTB&quot; refers to the Gran Turismo Berlinetta (coupé) (fixed roof) body while &quot;GTS&quot; signifies a Gran Turismo Spider (targa top).

The &quot;328&quot; numbers in the model title referred to the total cubic capacity of the engine, 3.2 litres, and 8 for the number of cylinders. The new model was introduced at the 1985 Frankfurt Salon alongside the Mondial 3.2 series.

==Overview==

The 308 and 328 are considered a family of Ferrari road cars as they share similar (but not identical) body designs and appearances, chassis, and engine designs. Essentially the new 328 model was a revised and updated version of the 308, which had survived for eight years without any radical change to the overall shape, albeit with various changes to the 3-litre engine.

The 328 was the final evolution of the transversely mid-mounted, conventionally aspirated 90 degree V8 Dino engine. The transversely mounted engine is a popular way to save space on the rear-mid, rear wheel drive layout.

The 328 has been described as one of the most usable classic Ferraris because of its durable road record, history of appreciating value, and classical aesthetics.

=== Design ===

The original Pininfarina design was carried over from its predecessor but included subtle changes from the carrozzeria. The effect was both aesthetic and an improvement in overall aerodynamic characteristics. The car&#x27;s body was still largely built by hand coming from the coach builder Scaglietti works.

The revised body presented a softening of the wedge profile of its predecessor, with a redesigned nose that had a more rounded shape, which was complemented by similar treatment to the tail valance panel. The revised nose and tail sections featured body colour bumpers integral with the valance panels, which reflected the work done concurrently with the Mondial 3.2 models, with which they also shared a similar radiator grille and front light assembly layout. Thus all the eight-cylinder cars in the range shared fairly unified front and rear aspects, providing a homogeneous family image. The exhaust air louvres behind the retractable headlight pods on the 308 series disappeared, coupled with an increase in the size of the front lid radiator exhaust air louvre, which had been introduced on the 308 Quattrovalvole models. A new style and position of exterior door catch was also provided.

The interior trim also received a thorough overhaul, with new designs for the seat panel upholstery and stitching along with revised door panels and pulls. Cockpit switches were completely updated and modernized. The new back lit orange on black dashboard gauges were borrowed from Ferrari&#x27;s 1984 GTO supercar. The main instrument panel, seen through the anatomical Momo (Morreti-Monza) steering wheel, presented the driver with information from the large tachometer and speedometer.

Optional equipment available was air conditioning, a leather dashboard, leather headlining to the removable roof panel plus rear window surround, metallic paint, Pirelli P7 tyres, and a rear aerofoil (standard on some market models).

One minor problem was the design of the oil hose from the lower part of the engine to the oil cooler. This proved to be too short. The hose, being under constant pressure along with the motion of the running engine, would eventually separate from the oil cooler. The separation would in time cause the oil cooler to crack. One fix was to connect the oil hoses for the oil cooler (to and from the engine) &quot;up side down&quot;. This configuration provided more slack for the lower hose (itself now connected to the top of the oil cooler).

=== 1988 Update ===
Ferrari gave the 328 its only major mechanical update late in the 1988 model year. This mostly “analog” car became a bit more “digital” with the fitting of an anti-lock braking system (ABS) to its ventilated disc brakes. This necessitated a redesign of the suspension geometry to provide negative offset. The overall upgrade required the incorporation of convex hub 16-inch alloy wheels replacing the previous concave versions. Thus the original flat spoke &quot;star&quot; wheels became a convex design, in the style as fitted to the 3.2 Mondial models. The update began with chassis number 76626 (February 1988) and the improved suspension and convex wheels were used whether the car was fitted with ABS or not. In Europe, ABS was an option for all mid-1988 and 1989 models. In the US, mid-1988 models did not have ABS while all MY 1989&#x27;s did. The mid-1988 models are often referred to as MY 1988 1/2. The wheel changes are a visual differentiator for the later models. In 1988 and 1989, the side view door mirrors also wore small Cavallino Rampante emblems.

=== Production ===

The 328 model remained in production for four years (1985 to 1989). By the time it was replaced by the 348 in the Autumn of 1989, a total of 7,412 vehicles had been made. GTS production totaled 6,068 vehicles in the chassis number range of 59301 to 83136. GTS production outnumbered the GTB version almost five to one. GTB production totaled 1,344 vehicles in the chassis range of 58735 to 83017. The early part of each series were numbered in the Ferrari odd number road car chassis sequence, and later examples (post chassis number 75000) in the continuous number sequence.

=== History ===

The 308/328 family was, at the time, one of the most commercially successful for Ferrari with nearly 20,000 produced.

The very first developmental prototype for the 328 model was manufactured in the summer of 1984. Chassis number 49543 was certified, road-registered and extensively tested through the spring of 1985. Interestingly, the original prototype was manufactured as a full soft top cabriolet convertible.

The story is that while the technical departments were pleased with the performance of the prototype, the marketing influence feared that as a convertible, it would compete with the Mondial Cabriolet model. It was subsequently produced, like its predecessor, only in Berlinetta (GTB - coupe) and removable hard top Spider (GTS - targa) variants. As of 2018, cabriolet chassis number 49543 was still in existence and registered for road use in Italy.

The last production year for the 328 GTB/GTS was September 1988 to Sept/Oct 1989 (model year 1989). 1338 total vehicles were manufactured that year. With Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s death in August 1988, many of these last cars were purchased either as a tribute or with speculation in mind. Decades later, it is still not unheard of to occasionally find a 328 for sale from the last production year that was never registered for road use. 1,344 GTBs and 6,068 GTSs were produced in total.

== Specifications ==

=== Engine ===

The 328 uses the Ferrari Dino engine produced from the late 1950s to the early 2000s. It is a very similar engine design as that used in the 308 Quattrovalvole model. It has a naturally aspirated 3.2-litre (3185 cc), 4-valve-per-cylinder (quattro valvole), transverse mounted, rear mid-engine V8 layout (Tipo F105 CB 000). It has a bore and stroke of 83 mm (3.3 in) x 73.6 mm (2.9 in). The engine retained the Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system of its predecessor, but was fitted with a Marelli MED 806 A electronic ignition system. It produces and of torque. Its top speed is and reaches in 5.5 seconds and in 13.0 seconds. As with the preceding 308 models the engine was mounted in unit with the all synchromesh five-speed manual transmission assembly, which was below and to the rear of the engine&#x27;s wet sump. The manual gear shifter was the traditional Ferrari gated design.

=== Chassis ===
The 328&#x27;s chassis designation is F106 AS (or AB) / R (or PB). The AS or AB difference is Spider vs. Berlinetta. The R or PB difference is R = before mid-1988; and PB = after mid-1988. The main European market chassis designation is F106 MS (or MB) 100.

The 328&#x27;s frame is constructed of oval-shaped tubular steel giving it race car rigidity without significant weight penalty. The body is formed largely from steel with an aluminium front hood and a fiberglass sandwiched steel floorpan. The adaption of galvanized steel was a key improvement from previous models which drastically retarded corrosion. The exterior and structural design substantially reduced the cars weight compared to its predecessor.

The front and rear independent suspension is based on the traditional unequal length double wishbone design. It included coil springs and hydraulic telescopic Koni shock absorbers. It featured front and rear anti roll bars. The brakes were large vented discs with twin-piston calipers actuated, as on the 308, by a hydraulic system offering security through redundancy. The anti-lock braking system was a late model addition with updated suspension geometry to further reduce squat and dive. The steering is unassisted rack and pinion slightly quicker than its predecessor at 3.25 turns, lock to lock.

==GTB/GTS Turbo==

In 1986, Ferrari launched a two-litre, turbocharged and intercooled variant of the 328, designated simply GTB Turbo and GTS Turbo—replacing the previous 308-based, non-intercooled, Ferrari 208 GTB/GTS Turbo. This version was developed specifically for the domestic Italian market, where cars with a displacement of over 2-litre like the 328 were subject to a 38% value added tax, up from the normal 18%.

The turbocharged &quot;Tipo F106 N 000&quot; V8 was evolved from the 208 Turbo&#x27;s engine, chiefly by adding an intercooler and adopting a new turbocharger. The development of the complete powertrain was carried out by Nicola Materazzi who had extensive experience in turbocharging from the Lancia Stratos GR5, the Ferrari 126C and had been the Chief Engineer for the 288 GTO and GTO Evoluzione (and later the Ferrari F40). Displacement was unchanged, at 1991 cc with a bore and stroke of but the cylinders were coated with Cermetal NC21 to lower the friction; usefully the engine was fitted with a detonation (knock) sensor, able to retard the ignition in case of near catastrophic pre-ignition. There were four overhead camshafts driving two valves per cylinder; Bosch K-jetronic mechanical fuel injection was carried over from the 208. Whereas 208 Turbos had used a KKK turbocharger, these new 328-based cars used a water-cooled IHI unit running at of boost. Charge air was cooled by a Behr air-to-air intercooler mounted on top of the engine. Output was at 6,500 rpm and at 4,100 rpm; maximum torque was reached at engine speeds 700 rpm lower than on the 208 Turbo, making the engine more flexible. The change of turbocharger manufacturer and the addition of the intercooler were design decisions taken from Materazzi&#x27;s experience with the 288 GTO where the IHI turbochargers had proven to give the best transient response. IHI materials and compressor/turbine geometry was then more advanced than that of KKK. The water-cooling of the turbocharger as well as the lower combustion temperatures afforded by the cooler intake air allow the car to be used harder and more reliably. The car could have produced significantly more power but for commercial reasons Ferrari management decided to keep it below the 270 PS of the naturally aspirated 328.

Other than the engine, differences between the two-litre Turbo and the regular 328 were minimal. Accommodating the top-mounted intercooler required a redesigned engine cover, as well as ducting and NACA intakes (positioned just forwards of each rear wheel arch) to feed it with fresh air. The rear bumper sported five ventilation holes. A black roof spoiler, optional on the 328, was standard; inside a boost pressure gauge was added to the instrument cluster. The gearlever shows numbers in red instead of white colour.

According to the manufacturer top speed was and took 6.3 seconds. In June 1986 Italian automobile magazine Quattroruote published a comparison test between a 328 GTS and a GTS Turbo. Despite the differences between the former&#x27;s more powerful 32-valve atmospheric engine and the latter&#x27;s torquier but peakier turbocharged 16-valve engine, performance was found to be quite similar in both acceleration and top speed. The Turbo sprinted from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.6 seconds (a tenth of a second behind the 328) and covered the standing kilometre in 24.6 seconds, two tenths behind the 328. Quattroruote recorded a top speed of .

During the production period between 1986 and 1989, Ferrari made a total of 308 GTB Turbos and 828 GTS Turbos.

<text>Wander This World is the third studio album by American blues guitarist Jonny Lang, released in 1998, when he was 17. The album was recorded at Seedy Underbelly Studios, Oarfin Studios in Minneapolis, and the Sound Kitchen in Nashville. This album produced Lang&#x27;s first Grammy nomination.

The album contains a mix of genres; some tracks are blues, while others are Southern-style soul, funk, or rock with a blues feel. &quot;Angel of Mercy&quot; and Luther Allison&#x27;s &quot;Cherry Red Wine&quot; are twelve-bar blues; &quot;Walking Away&quot; and &quot;Second Guessing&quot; are similar to 1960s Memphis soul; and &quot;The Levee&quot; and &quot;Still Rainin&#x27;&quot; are more rock-orientated.

Reviewer Alex Henderson commented on how mature the 17-year-old Lang sounded, saying the album often sounded like it could be the work of a 30-year-old.

<doc id="588314" wikidata="Q4047797" url="?curid=588314" title="R32 (New York City Subway car)">
<text>The R32 was a New York City Subway car model built by the Budd Company from 1964 to 1965 for the IND/BMT B Division. A total of 600 R32s were built, numbered 3350–3949, though some cars were re-numbered. The R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: R32 (cars 3350–3649) and R32A (cars 3650–3949); the former was paid by the city&#x27;s capital budget and the latter was paid through a revenue bond. All were arranged as married pairs. 

The R32s were the first mass-produced stainless steel cars built for the New York City Subway. A ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 &quot;Brightliners&quot; cars was held on September 9, 1964. Various modifications were made over the years to the R32 fleet. In the late 1980s, all of the R32 cars were rebuilt, with ten cars being rebuilt by General Electric and the remaining cars being rebuilt by Morrison–Knudsen. As part of the refurbishment, the original rollsigns and express/local marker lights at the end of each car were replaced with flipdot signs. After refurbishment, the R32 and R32A cars were renamed R32 Phase I, R32 Phase II, and R32 GE.

The R160 order was to replace all R32s in the late 2000s, but about one-third of the original fleet remained, when it was decided to retire the NYCT R44s instead. The R179 order replaced the remainder of the R32s in the early 2020s. The R32s temporarily resumed service from July 1, 2020 through October 8, 2020 when the R179s were pulled from service. A series of farewell trips with the final train of R32s running in passenger service began on December 19, 2021 and concluded on January 9, 2022. After retirement, most of the R32s were scrapped, sunk as artificial reefs, or placed into storage, but some have been preserved, and others retained for various purposes.

==Description==
The R32s were numbered 3350–3949, although some cars were re-numbered outside of this range or to different numbers in this range. They were the first cars to introduce all-mylar route and destination rollsigns instead of the former cotton cloth or linen type rollsigns found on prior rail cars.

The R32 contract was divided into two subcontracts of 300 cars each: R32 (cars 3350–3649) and R32A (cars 3650–3949). The R32As were funded through the proceeds of a revenue bond, while the R32s were paid for out of the 1963–1964 New York City capital budget. The two subcontracts differed with the first 150 R32s (3350–3499) having visible bulkhead horns; these were the last cars to be built with this feature. This feature can also be found on the Redbirds, R27s, and R30s, along with various older trains. Another distinctive difference was the interior lighting featuring backlit ad-signs on R32A cars 3800–3949.

The R32s were the first mass-produced stainless steel cars built for the New York City Subway. Two previous Budd orders (the BMT Zephyr and the R11s) were limited production and/or experimental orders. The horizontally ribbed, shiny, and unpainted stainless exteriors earned the cars the nickname &quot;Brightliners&quot;. The use of stainless steel reduced the weight of each car by over 4,000 pounds, when compared to previous models.

==History==

In June 1963, the New York City Transit Authority contracted with Budd for 600 IND/BMT cars (300 pairs) to replace older equipment (cars that had exceeded the TA&#x27;s 35-year limit of age), including the BMT D-type Triplex articulated cars and some of the BMT Standards. At the time, this was the largest railcar order ever placed in the United States for subway cars.

The cars were ordered for $68,820,000, of which half was provided by New York City and half through the sale of bonds by the New York City Transit Authority. Budd had bid on previous contracts with the NYCTA, but had never won a City contract for a production run of cars until the R32s, as Budd built only stainless-steel equipment, and the TA refused to allow a differential in competitive bids for this higher-quality construction.

Budd won the contract by offering the lowest bid of $114,700 per car. The next lowest bidder came in at $117,900 per car, which was for low-alloy steel cars. Budd introduced stainless steel equipment to the modern New York City Subway system, a plan that was met with limited success. NYCTA allowed a premium for subsequent stainless steel contracts, and all subsequent equipment was at least partly constructed of stainless steel. However, the Budd Company never benefited from the change, as they failed to win further contracts from the NYCTA, and the company has since halted the production of railroad cars.

The R32 cars originally came with blue passenger doors and blue storm doors. The passenger doors of many cars were repainted silver from 1974, as the graffiti epidemic worsened. Some cars retained or regained blue passenger doors towards the start of the General Overhaul (GOH) program, which replaced all the doors with stainless steel versions.

On August 18, 1964, the NYCTA approved a modification to the 300 R32s already constructed. The modification was required to ensure proper clearance in tunnels. Since the cars were 4,000 pounds lighter than other subway cars when new, they did not sink as low on standard trucks and springs. The modification involved the modification of the body bolster.

A ceremonial introduction trip for the new R32 &quot;Brightliners&quot; cars was held on September 9, 1964, operating from the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s Mott Haven Yards in the Bronx to Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan along the Park Avenue main line (presently operated by Metro-North Railroad). The new cars were then placed into service on the on September 14, 1964, after their New York Central&#x27;s spring-loaded under-running third rail shoes were replaced with gravity-type overrunning subway third rail shoes. The R32s were originally assigned to the BMT Southern Division service only, initially on the Brighton Line (Q train) and the Sea Beach Line ( train), but were eventually reassigned to the West End Line ( and TT trains).

Cars 3946–3949 were delivered with Pioneer trucks and disc brakes in 1966. These trucks were replaced with standard trucks in 1976.

In 1974, cars 3700–3701 were sent to Garrett AiResearch&#x27;s facilities in Los Angeles, California, to test out Flywheel energy storage system equipment. 3700 received energy conservation machinery with batteries and amber-type digital readout indicating the amount of energy used by the equipment, while 3701 remained unmodified. These cars were later tested at the UMTA, and the US Department of Transportation&#x27;s Testing Facilities in Pueblo, Colorado, for evaluation, and were returned to the MTA in 1976 for in-service testing on all BMT/IND Lines to check the effectiveness of the technology.

===Overhaul and mishaps===
Cars 3616, 3629, 3651, and 3766 were scrapped due to collision damage sustained in various accidents in the 1970s and 1980s. Their mates were paired with other cars. 

Car 3659 was rebuilt as an even-numbered car and renumbered to 3348 following the loss of its even-numbered mate in an accident. Car 3669 was retired following a derailment, so its even-numbered mate 3668 was rebuilt into an odd-numbered car and renumbered to 3669.

From 1988 to 1990, as part of the NYCTA General Overhaul (GOH) program, the R32 cars were rebuilt. Ten cars were rebuilt by General Electric at its facility in Buffalo, New York (cars 3594–3595, 3880–3881, 3892–3893, 3936–3937, and 3934–3935) as prototype rebuilds, and the remaining cars were rebuilt by Morrison–Knudsen at its facility in Hornell, New York. During the rebuilding process, the route and destination mylar rollsigns located above the storm doors were removed and replaced with Luminator flipdot electronic route signs that can display both letters and numbers, including zero to nine. This is because the air conditioning evaporators mounted on the interior car ends made it difficult to change the front route and destination signs. The distinctive &quot;EXP&quot; (express) and &quot;LOCAL&quot; marker lights were removed. The rollsigns on the sides of the cars were retained and updated.

After refurbishment, the R32 and R32A cars were renamed R32 Phase I, R32 Phase II, and R32 GE. The R32 Phase I cars (re-built by Morrison–Knudsen) had WABCO Air Brake packages, GE Master Controllers, and Thermo King HVAC units. The R32 Phase II cars (also re-built by Morrison–Knudsen) had NY Air Brake equipment, Westinghouse Master Controllers, and Stone Safety HVAC units. The ten prototype rebuild R32 GE cars differ from the Phase I and II cars as they were rebuilt to R38 specifications. They had experimental Sigma HVAC Units powered by A/C motors and solid state inverters, original traction motors rebuilt to 115 horsepower instead of the traditional 100 horsepower units, backlit ad signs, and different bulkhead designs. Since the cars were sent out to be overhauled based on how poorly they were performing (worst first), there were R32s and R32As rebuilt in both Phase I and Phase II configurations. There were about a dozen or more pairs that are composed of R32 and R32A mixes.

===Retirement===
The R160s replaced most of the R32s in the late 2000s. The ten GE cars were retired first in the summer of 2007. The Phase II R32s followed a year later, from March 2008 until October 13, 2008. A handful of Phase I R32s were retired from early 2009 until November 2009, when it was decided to retire the NYCT R44s instead. By December 2010, only 232 active cars remained, 222 of which were assigned to 207th Street Yard, operating on the A and C. These had periodically underwent intermittent SMS (Scheduled Maintenance Service, a life-extension program) cycles – at a cost of $25 million – to extend their useful lives. 

The R179s replaced the remainder of the R32s in the early 2020s. The R32s were originally slated for retirement in 2017, but the R179s experienced delays in delivery. Subsequently, plans were changed to retain the R32s in order for them to provide a backup fleet and support service increased frequencies until in 2022, when they would finally be replaced by the R211s. By January 2020, it was again decided to retire the R32s with the R179s. 

With the R179 delivery completed, the R32s were gradually phased out until the last train made its final trip on the C on March 26, 2020. In June 2020, some R32s were reactivated and transferred to East New York Yard to provide backup revenue service due to the R179s being pulled from service. The R32s re-entered service on the J and Z on July 1, 2020 until being withdrawn again on October 8, 2020.

After a year in storage, the R32s were officially retired when the last train made final runs in December 2021 and January 2022 as part of a series of farewell trips organized by the New York Transit Museum on four consecutive Sundays. On December 19 and 26, 2021, and January 2, 2022, the train ran along the and routes between 145th Street and Second Avenue. On January 9, 2022, the train ran along the between 96th Street and Brighton Beach, making express stops.

Most cars retired by the R160s were stripped and sunk as artificial reefs. After the reefing program ended in April 2010, cars retired by the R160s were trucked to Sims Metal Management&#x27;s Newark facility to be scrapped. The scrapping and processing of these cars occurred between April 2013 and October 2013.

Between February 2022 and mid-2023, cars retired by the R179s were towed through the South Brooklyn Railway, New York New Jersey Rail, and the Brooklyn Army Terminal before being partially disassembled for shipment to Frontier Industrial Corp in Ohio to be scrapped. Since late 2023, cars retired by the R179s are being towed through the South Brooklyn Railway, New York New Jersey Rail, and the Brooklyn Army Terminal before being further towed to Sims Metal Management&#x27;s Jersey City facility to be scrapped.

Some R32 cars were saved for various purposes, as following:
* Phase II pair 3350–3351 – set aside for preservation by the Railway Preservation Corp.
* Phase II pair 3352–3353 – set aside for preservation by the New York Transit Museum. This pair was the lead pair on the R32s&#x27; premiere trip on September 9, 1964.
* Phase I pair 3360–3361 – set aside for preservation by the New York Transit Museum. This pair was the lead pair on the R32s&#x27; final trip on January 9, 2022, having been repainted into a replica of its original appearance.
* Phase I car 3389 – converted to a maintenance of way car for the Staten Island Railway. It was retrofitted with high-powered lasers to incinerate leaf residue.
* Phase I pair 3432–3433 – preserved by the Craggy Mountain Line in Asheville, North Carolina.
* GE-rebuilt pair 3594–3595 – being used as NYPD training cars at Floyd Bennett Field.

Ten cars taken out of revenue service in December 2010 were used for work service, handling such tasks as providing traction for B Division rail adhesion cars and refuse collection trains. They were eventually replaced by fifty R42 cars between 2020 and 2022.

==Longevity==
The longest-lasting R32s were in service for almost 58 years, currently the longest such service life in New York City rapid transit operations. They were the last cars built for the New York City Transit Authority – prior to its merger with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968 – to remain in service. The R32s had survived well past their specified service life of 35 years. They are the oldest rolling stock since the retirement of the Redbird trains, and the oldest rolling stock of any metro system in North America, as well as some of the oldest rolling stock of any metro system anywhere in the world. The R32s outlasted the newer R38s, R40s, R42s, and New York City Transit R44s.

Despite their considerable structural quality, the R32s suffered from low mechanical reliability near the end of their service lives. They had the lowest Mean Distance Between Failures figures of the active fleet, as the overhauls they received during the 1988–89 period wore out after 29–30 years. Others criticized the R32s for their appearance and lack of comfort. In August 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the R32s &quot;a dreary reminder to passengers of an earlier subterranean era&quot;, and claimed that &quot;time has taken a toll&quot; on the cars. The cars had worn-out air conditioning, propulsion, and braking systems, so they were often temporarily transferred to services with mostly outdoor or elevated portions, namely the A, J, and Z.

== In popular culture ==
In the famous car chase scene in the film &quot;The French Connection&quot;, the chased train of R42s crashes into an R32.

An R32 is featured in &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, featuring an alien entering a tunnel. Once there, it attacks and devours most of a subway train (which is a combination of R32 and R38 cars) until Agent J destroys it. He is then seen walking out of the station, 81st Street–Museum of Natural History.

An R32 is featured in &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot;, but the train is historically inaccurate.

A train of R32s was featured in the 2015 film &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, although the film is set a decade prior to their manufacturing. Interior shots were filmed in the New York Transit Museum.

Several trains of R32s were featured in the movie &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, on the train.

An R32 is featured at Church Avenue, 18th Avenue, and Bedford Park Boulevard stations for the movie &quot;Joker&quot;.

An R32 is featured in the second season of &quot;Russian Doll&quot;.

An R32 is featured in the film &quot;Past Lives&quot;.

<text>Freeport-McMoRan Inc., often called Freeport, is an American mining company based in the Freeport-McMoRan Center, in Phoenix, Arizona. The company is the world&#x27;s largest producer of molybdenum, a major copper producer and operates the world&#x27;s largest gold mine, the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia.

==History==

The current company was created in 1981 through the merger of Freeport Minerals, formerly Texas Freeport Sulphur Company and McMoRan Oil &amp; Gas Company, becoming Freeport-McMoRan Inc.

===Early history===
Freeport Sulphur Company was founded July 12, 1912, by the eldest son of Svante Magnus &quot;E.M.&quot; Swenson, banker Eric Pierson Swenson, with a group of investors, to develop sulfur mining at Bryan Mound salt dome, along the US Gulf Coast. Freeport, Texas was also established in Nov. 1912 to house workers, and serve as a port for Houston, rivaling Galveston and Corpus Christi.

Freeport mined sulfur along the Gulf Coast using the Frasch Process, the patents for which had expired in 1912. Previously, Union Sulphur Company founder and patent-holder Herman Frasch had enjoyed a monopoly on the process. The company became known as Freeport Sulphur, later changing its corporate name to Freeport Minerals.

In 1922, Freeport started producing sulfur from Hoskins Mound in Brazoria County, Texas.

===Freeport Texas Company===
Enterprise to support Freeport Sulphur&#x27;s business and the new town&#x27;s infrastructure led to the incorporation of a holding company on September 30, 1913, to join the newer assets with Freeport Sulphur. Officers of the new holding company, Freeport Texas Company, were:
* Eric. P. Swenson, President and Director (Freeport Sulphur founder, son of Swante M. Swenson)
* Edward E. Dickinson, Vice-President and Director
* F.M. Altz, Secretary
* Swante M. Swenson, Treasurer (son of Eric P. Swenson)
* Charles H. Findlay, Auditor (son of Hugh Findlay and his third wife, Mary Ellen Smith)
* Richard H. Williams, Director (son of Richard H. Williams)
* Harry K. Knapp, Director
* Samuel McRoberts, Director
* Charles P. Northrop, Director
* Charles A. Stone, Director
* Frank A. Vanderlip, Director
* Sidell Tilghman, Director (son of General Lloyd Tilghman)
* Eppa Hunton Jr., Director (son of late Virginia Senator, Brig. Gen. Eppa Hunton)
* Charles E. Herrmann, Director.

The new corporation&#x27;s principal assets were listed as:
* Freeport Sulphur
* Freeport Gas Co.
* Freeport Sulphur Transportation Company
* Freeport Town Site Co.
* Freeport Terminal Co.
* Freeport Light, Water &amp; Ice Co.
* South Texas Stevedore Co.
* La Espuela Oil Co.
* Société pour l&#x27;Importation et la Vente des Soufres
* Houston &amp; Brazoz Valley Ry

In 1919, minority stockholders John R. Williams &amp; Sons, First National Bank of Richmond, Virginia vice-president, W. M. Addison, Benjamin P Alsopp, E. L. Norton, and Samuel W. Travers solicited proxies to use at the April 5th annual stockholders&#x27; meeting, claiming, according to reports, that &quot;management has refused them adequate information regarding the property. President E.P. Swenson denies that information has been thus withheld and states that the board, which represents the dominant interests, has no vacancies at the present time.&quot;

===1928–1931 shareholder proxy fight===
In 1928, shareholder and scion of one of the founding investment firms, John Langbourne Williams &amp; Sons, Langbourne Meade Williams, Jr. launched a proxy fight for control of the company. In 1929, he then sought help from his former supervisor at Lee, Higginson &amp; Co., J.T. Claiborne, who then enlisted clerk John Hay Whitney – who had become one of the wealthiest men in America following the 1927 death of his father, Payne Whitney. Williams eventually gained control of the company from founder Swenson, becoming its president in 1931, with Claiborne as a Vice-President, and Whitney as Chairman. Williams also served as Chairman during 1958–1967.

Williams led the company&#x27;s diversification, beginning with the purchase of manganese deposits in Oriente Province, Cuba.

=== 1930s ===
In 1932, Freeport Sulphur Company acquired the sulfur rights for Lake Grande Ecaille and vicinity in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, and escalated the development of sulfur deposits in the Grand Ecaille dome in 1933, still using the Frasch Process developed by Dr. Herman Frasch, who had, in 1895, enjoined the American Sulphur Company into a partnership, forming the Union Sulphur Company, to initiate the first successful sulfur mining at Grand Ecaille, with which Freeport, like other competitors, would compete upon expiry of the Frasch patents in 1908. From its earliest inception, sulfur mining was the catalyst that developed Port Sulphur, Louisiana.

===1950s===
The company produced nickel during World War II and potash in the 1950s. In 1955, Freeport Nickel invested $119 million, of which $100 million came from the U.S. government, into construction of a nickel-cobalt mine at Moa Bay, Cuba, and a refinery at Port Nickel, Louisiana. On March 11, 1957, the U.S. government announced a contract to buy nickel and cobalt from the company.

In 1956, the company formed the Freeport Oil Company. In 1958, the company sold an oil discovery near Lake Washington in Louisiana for approximately $100 million to Magnolia Petroleum Company.

In 1959, Freeport geologists confirmed the 1936 Dutch discovery of the rich Ertsberg copper and gold deposits, now known as the Grasberg mine, in extremely rugged, remote country in the Jayawijaya Mountains in what was then called the Netherlands New Guinea.

===1960s===
* In 1960, Fidel Castro implemented a 25% ore tax, effectively nationalizing and seizing Freeport&#x27;s nickel-mining operations in Cuba.
* In 1961, the company entered the kaolin business after purchasing the assets of Southern Clays Inc. In 1964, the company formed Freeport of Australia to pursue mining opportunities there and in the surrounding Pacific Ocean region.

====Development of the Ertsberg deposit====
In 1967, the company negotiated a contract with the Indonesian government to develop the Ertsberg deposit. In their feasibility study, Freeport geologists estimated that the orebody totaled 33 million tons averaging 2.5% copper, making it the largest above-ground copper deposit ever discovered. Construction of an open pit mine began in May 1970 and in mid-1973 the mine was declared fully operational. Officials at Bechtel, the primary project contractor, called mine development at Ertsberg &quot;the most difficult engineering project they had ever undertaken.&quot; The challenges included building a long access road (a project that required boring kilometer long tunnels through two mountains) and constructing the world&#x27;s longest single span aerial tramway. The tramways were needed to move people, supplies and ore because a cliff separates the Ertsberg mine (at elevation) from the mill (at 10,000 feet). Moving copper concentrate from that mill to the shipping port required installation of a slurry pipeline – then the world&#x27;s longest. Mine construction and startup cost about US$200 million. The Ertsberg project was an engineering marvel, but the mine&#x27;s early financial performance was disappointing. Depressed copper prices and high operating costs kept profits marginal during the 1970s.

In 1967 The McMoRan Oil and Gas Company was founded by three partners, William Kennon McWilliams Jr. (&quot;Mc&quot;), James Robert (Jim Bob) Moffett (&quot;Mo&quot;), who were both petroleum geologists, and Mack Rankin (&quot;Ran&quot;), a specialist in land-leasing and sales operations. In 1981, McMoRab would merge with Freeport Minerals, formerly Freeport Sulphur, to form Freeport-McMoRan.

===1970s===
In 1971, the company changed its name to Freeport Minerals Company, (not to be confused with Freeport Minerals Corporation, founded in 1834).

===1980s===
In 1981, Freeport Minerals Company merged with the McMoRan Oil and Gas Company. 

In 1981, the company formed a 70/30 joint venture with an affiliate of FMC Corporation to operate the Jerritt Canyon gold mine near Elko, Nevada. In 1985, the company headquarters moved to New Orleans, Louisiana. The company also sold a 25% interest in oil and gas assets primarily in the western United States to Britoil for $73.5 million.

In 1989, the company sold about $1.5 billion in assets to finance development of the Grasberg mine and the Main Pass offshore sulfur-oil-gas deposit off Louisiana.

===1990s===
In 1994, the company completed the corporate spin-off of its entire interest in Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold, which owned the Grasberg mine.

In 1995, RTZ, a predecessor of Rio Tinto Group, made a $450 million investment in the company.

In 1997, IMC Global, a large fertilizer producer, acquired Freeport-McMoRan Inc., the former parent company that now owned the sulfur and fertilizer businesses, in a $750 million transaction. Shareholders of Freeport-McMoRan received shares of IMC Global.

In 1997, the Indonesian government asked Freeport-McMoRan to substantiate the Canadian mining company Bre-X&#x27;s claims of having found the largest gold mine ever discovered, in Borneo. Freeport announced that its prospective partner Bre-X did not have gold reserves at its Indonesian mine, as it had reported. Bre-X subsequently was exposed as a fraud and went bankrupt.

In 1998, low commodity prices forced the company to suspend its dividend.

===2000s===
In 2003, the company was subpoenaed as part of an investigation by anti-trust authorities in the United States, Canada, and Europe into price fixing in the copper industry.

On March 19, 2007, the company acquired Phelps Dodge (for $25.9 Billion) and became the largest copper producer of any public company in the world. The corporate headquarters was moved from New Orleans, Louisiana to Phoenix, Arizona.

=== 2010s ===
In 2012, the company announced agreements to acquire affiliated companies McMoRan Exploration Company and Plains Exploration &amp; Production Company for a total enterprise value of over $20 billion. The transaction added significantly to the company&#x27;s petroleum assets. The transaction was criticized as a conflict of interest due to the common ownership of the companies. In 2015, the company paid a $137.5 million settlement to resolve claims that executives and directors had conflicts of interest that resulted in the company overpaying in that transaction.

In 2014, the company sold its assets in the Eagle Ford shale to Encana for $3.1 billion. In 2015, the company announced job cuts at its Sierrita Mine in Arizona due to low copper and molybdenum prices.

On December 28, 2015, the company announced that James R. Moffett would resign as chairman of the company and be replaced by Gerald J. Ford. Moffett received $16.1 million in severance pay and cash retirement plans totaling more than $63 million. Moffett continued to consult for the company for annual fees of $1.5 million.

In May 2016, the company sold a 13% interest in its Morenci Mine to Sumitomo Group for $1 billion in cash.

In 2016, Freeport sold its deepwater assets, including the Marlin TLP, and the Holstein and Horn Mountain spars, to Anadarko Petroleum.

In August 2017, the company agreed to give a 51% interest in the Grasberg mine to the Government of Indonesia and build a smelter in exchange for a special permit to operate the mine until 2041.

In 2018, the company ranked at number 176 on the Fortune 500 list. During this year, Indonesian President Joko Widodo also planned to take control of 51% of Freeport Indonesia&#x27;s equity, effectively handing over Freeport control to the Indonesian government. The Indonesian government planned to settle payments of $3.85 billion during the takeover process. The Indonesian government finalized the process on December 21, 2018.

==Current operations==

Freeport is the world&#x27;s largest producer of molybdenum, and one of the largest producers of copper. In 2019, 79% of its revenues were from the sale of copper, 11% were from the sale of gold, and 8% were from the sale of molybdenum. In 2019, sales to the company&#x27;s copper refining joint venture in Gresik Regency accounted for 13% of the total revenues of the company.

Some of the company&#x27;s mining operations are as follows:

===Africa===
Freeport Cobalt held a 100% interest in Kisanfu, a copper and cobalt exploration project located near Tenke, Democratic Republic of the Congo. This subsidiary also owns a large cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland, along with a related sales and marketing business. FCX has an effective 56% of that enterprise. Negotiations in 2016 to include these cobalt projects in a sale to China Molybdenum of Tenke Fungurume Mine, a cobalt/copper mine in DRC Congo, were not successful. Instead, the Kisanfu mine was sold to China Molybdenum in a separate transaction in 2020.

===Europe===
In December 2019, Freeport Cobalt (a joint venture between Freeport-McMoRan and Lundin Mining) sold its cobalt refinery in Kokkola, Finland to Umicore. FCX held an effective 56% interest in that enterprise.

==Past holdings==
* Jerritt Canyon mine, near Elko, Nevada has produced over 8 million ounces of gold since 1981. Originally a joint venture of Freeport McMoRan (FCX) with FMC Corporation, then FMC Gold then Meridian Gold, Freeport&#x27;s share of Jerritt Canyon was then sold to Independence Mining Co., a subsidiary of Minorco (an Anglo American Corporation subsidiary). Minorco later divested all its gold mining assets to AngloGold. AngloGold and Meridian Gold sold the mine to Queenstake Resources in 2003. In 2007 Queenstake and Yukon Gold Corp merged to become Yukon-Nevada Gold, which in 2012 became Veris Gold. Veris Gold operated under U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act bankruptcy protections of Canada from June 9, 2014. Sprott Mining bought the concern after the Canadian bankruptcy court ordered Veris to sell its assets.
* In May 2016 Freeport announced an agreement to sell its interests in TF Holdings to China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. (CMOC) for $2.65 billion in cash and possibly more if the average copper price rose enough to trigger the increase in the following 24 months. TF Holdings was a Bermuda holding company with indirect ownership of 80% of Tenke Fungurume Mine. Since FCX had owned 70% ownership of TF Holdings, the sale gave China Molybdenum a 56% interest in Tenke Fungurume Mine. The parties discussed including Kokkola refinery and Kisanfu Exploration in the sale, but did not agree on the terms to do so.
* In December 2020, Freeport completed the sale of its interests in the Kisanfu undeveloped project in Democratic Republic of Congo to a wholly owned subsidiary of China Molybdenum Co., Ltd. for US$550 million.

==Past board members==

==Controversies==

=== Safety record ===
In 2011, Freeport was fined by the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s Mine Safety and Health Administration over the death of a miner. The 67-year-old man had fallen into a hole created by the removal of two steel gratings. It was concluded that Freeport had not done enough to indicate that the hole was there.

===Grasberg Mine===
The company operates the world&#x27;s largest and most profitable gold mine, the Grasberg mine in Papua, Indonesia.

In 2003, a landslide killed eight workers. A government study concluded that the incident was the result of negligence. Important warning signs had been detected two days prior. In response to this, management moved some equipment, but did not keep workers out of the area. A month later two workers died from being exposed to sulfur fumes. The government ultimately overturned its conclusion and attributed the incident to natural causes.

In 2005, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the company paid local military and police generals, colonels, majors and captains, and military units, a total of nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004. One individual received up to US$150,000. The payments were meant to secure the reserve. The company responded that the payments did not go to individuals, but went into infrastructure, food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs, and allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs. According to the report, anonymous sources within the company claimed that company chairman James R. Moffet courted Indonesia&#x27;s dictator Suharto and &quot;his cronies&quot;, cutting them in on deals. Another employee is said to have worked on a program to monitor environmentalists&#x27; telephone and email conversations, in collaboration with Indonesian military intelligence officers.

The Grasberg mine&#x27;s tailings &quot;severely impacted&quot; more than of rainforest, according to a 1996 Dames &amp; Moore environmental audit. The report, endorsed by Freeport, also estimated that during the life of the mine 3.2 billion tons of waste rocklarge components of which generate acidwould be dumped into the local river system. Overburden (waste rock) from the mine had already polluted a nearby lake due to acid mine drainage.

Citing extensive, long-term and irreversible environmental damage in New Guinea, the Government Pension Fund of Norway excluded Freeport-McMoRan from its investment portfolio, following a recommendation from the fund&#x27;s ethical council.

In 2013, a tunnel collapse killed twenty eight workers. The Freeport geological team claimed that the collapse at the Big Gossan tunnel was caused by erosion of the ceiling, brought about by the continuous infiltration of the limestone wallrocks by corrosive acidic groundwater. Freeport was accused of negligence by the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission.

=== Human rights record in Indonesia ===

The company is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. However, the company has been accused of funding the Indonesian government to secure its reserve through militaristic oppression of the native West Papuan people. Freeport has had a troubled relationship with the Amungme and Kamoro peoples since it arrived in Indonesia in 1967. Freeport allegedly damaged 30.000 hectares of the rainforest and two major rivers, on which they depend for their food, water, livelihoods, and traditions. Pressured by cultural and economic deterioration, there were numerous quarrels, between the tribes, Freeport, and the Indonesian military. Some unarmed natives were killed or tortured by the military, or became part of the Free Papua Movement insurgence.

===Environmental record===
Based on 2014 data, the Political Economy Research Institute ranked Freeport-McMoRan 13th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the U.S. The ranking is based on emission quantities and toxicity.

After discovery of uranium and sulfate in the groundwater, Cyprus Tohono Corporation provided North Komelik residents with bottled water until 2003. In 2003, two new supply wells were installed six miles south of the village. The mine used various mining methods to process ore into copper, and these methods required a mix of chemical fluids. Workers disposed of these chemicals in two areas downhill from the mine in unlined ponds. As a result, the liquid chemicals seeped into the ground below the disposal area and polluted a groundwater drinking source known as the “basin-fill aquifer.” The Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation, where the mine is located relies heavily upon groundwater to meet drinking water needs.

On October 15, 2009 the City of Blackwell filed suit against Freeport-McMoRan over the contamination caused by its Blackwell Zinc Smelter. The city considered the contamination a nuisance, and alleged that 58 million pounds of toxic waste remained in the city, causing illness within its 7,200 residents. The City of Blackwell and Freeport settled for $54M in February 2010. In 2012, Freeport agreed to a $119M settlement with the residents.

In April 2012, the US Department of Justice announced that Freeport McMoran would pay $6.8 million to settle federal and state charges pertaining to the toxic outflow from its Morenci mine in Arizona. According to the complaint waters, soils, habitats, and birds were either injured or lost as a result of the dangerous substances.

==Carbon footprint==
Freeport-McMoRan Inc reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 31 December 2020 at 7,116 Kt (-653 /-8.4% y-o-y). Emissions have been on a declining trend since 2015.
