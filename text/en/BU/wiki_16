<text>Mortal Kombat 4 is the fourth main installment in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series of fighting games developed by Midway Games. Released to arcades in 1997, &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; is the first title from the series, and one of the first made by Midway overall, to use 3D computer graphics. It is also the last game of the series to have an arcade release. It was later ported to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, PC, and Game Boy Color the following year, as well as an updated version titled &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot; released exclusively for the Dreamcast.

The gameplay system in &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; is similar to that of the previous games; one of the most notable additions is the use of weapons and objects during fights. The storyline chronicles the attack from the corrupted Elder God Shinnok against his former comrades who trapped him in the Netherealm many years prior to the beginning of the series. The other 17 playable characters take part in the battle between good and evil, with the forces of light trying to stop Shinnok and the forces of darkness from conquering all the realms.

While developing the game, the Midway staff had problems rendering the graphics as it was one of the first 3D fighting games they developed. Co-creator Ed Boon stated that the staff wanted to make &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; more violent than its predecessors, removing the comical finishing moves featured in them. Since its release, the game received generally positive response from critics, with the exception of the Game Boy Color port.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; is played in a similar way to the previous titles from the series; the run button and combos are still used, and despite the 3D graphics, characters are restricted to a 2D path except for sidestepping. &quot;MK4&quot; introduces a limited weapon system, allowing each character to take out a special weapon using a set button combination. Once equipped, the weapons are primarily used through the punch buttons. This includes swinging, clubbing or even tossing the weapons. The weapons can also be purposely dropped, in similar fashion to arena objects such as severed heads and rocks, another addition to the series. If an opponent&#x27;s weapon is dropped, the other character is able to pick it up and use it.

&quot;MK4&quot; added a &quot;Maximum Damage&quot; cap to the game&#x27;s combo system, automatically breaking combos if they deal over a set amount of damage to a player and, thus, preventing infinite combos (although this cap can be removed with a code). Unlike &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot; which contained multiple finishing moves of various kinds, &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; has the standard two Fatalities per character, in addition to two Stage Fatalities that can only be done in certain arenas and involve the winning character throwing their opponent into a part of the arena where they are killed. Unlike the first three games, this game does not include non-playable boss characters, except for Goro in the home versions.

==Plot==
Thousands of years before the setting of the first game, Shinnok, one of the Elder Gods who control the six realms in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; universe, attempted to become the conqueror of them all. The thunder god Raiden fought and defeated Shinnok in a war that spanned hundreds of years, sending him to the Netherrealm, where he would be trapped forever. Now, Shinnok has managed to escape from the Netherrealm with help from the sorcerer Quan Chi, and seeks vengeance against the Elder Gods who banished him. In his plan, he first conquers the realm of Edenia, with the aid of a traitor, Tanya, while he prepares to attack the Elder Gods. In order to stop Shinnok&#x27;s menace, Raiden requests help from the Earthrealm warriors who saved the realms from Emperor Shao Kahn in previous titles.

==Characters==
The game includes 15 playable characters, with additional secret characters. The following is a list of the characters included in the &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; character selection roster.

New characters:
* Fujin — Raiden&#x27;s ally, the Wind God who first appeared in &quot;Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot;.
* Jarek — The last member of the Black Dragon after Kano&#x27;s supposed death.
* Kai — A Shaolin monk and friend of Liu Kang.
* Quan Chi — The mysterious evil sorcerer who aided Shinnok in his escape from the Netherrealm. Quan Chi had previously appeared in &quot;Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot; and the animated series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot;. This game marks his first playable appearance in the series.
* Reiko — An Outworld assassin and Shinnok&#x27;s general.
* Shinnok — A fallen Elder God. Shinnok appears both as a playable character and the final boss of this game, after originally appearing in &quot;Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero&quot;, also as the final boss.
* Tanya — A traitor to Edenia.

Returning characters:
* Goro — The Shokan and former tournament champion who returns as a sub-boss in home versions, reprising his original role in the first game.
* Jax — A U.S. Special Forces officer who goes after Jarek when he finds out that he is still alive.
* Johnny Cage — The revived Hollywood movie star seeking to produce his next movie.
* Liu Kang — A Shaolin monk and a Mortal Kombat Champion who seeks to defeat Shinnok.
* Noob Saibot (secret character) — The undead servant of Quan Chi.
* Raiden — The thunder god who again guides the mortals.
* Reptile — A Zaterran warrior who seeks to serve Shinnok to save his realm.
* Scorpion — An undead ninja who again seeks revenge on his nemeses Sub-Zero and Quan Chi for the massacre of his clan.
* Sonya Blade — A Special Forces lieutenant who seeks to arrest Jarek.
* Sub-Zero — A former Lin Kuei member again stalked by Scorpion.

In addition, the game includes a hidden character and skin, Meat, that turns the player&#x27;s character into a bloody and fleshy skeleton. The game also introduces alternate costumes, as opposed to the palette swaps in previous installments. &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot; features five additional characters and one more secret character.

==Development==
Ed Boon, co-creator of the series, found it difficult to lead the development team for &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; due to the considerable increase in staff since the release of first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; title, with him as the only programmer. Therefore, Todd Allen and Mike Boon (Ed&#x27;s younger brother) joined as programmers. The Midway staff wanted to remove the comical elements from the previous &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; titles, so they focused on making Fatalities. On the other hand, the Animality finishing moves from &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; were removed since the transformation of a character into an animal was considered to be difficult to make in 3D graphics. In order to make the Fatalities more entertaining, they decided to make some of the Fatalities replay from different camera angles. Since actors were no longer needed to make the characters&#x27; movements with the exception of adding some motion capture elements, the staff found it easier to make Fatalities, as it was all done by computer animation. Some members of the development team had previously worked on &quot;War Gods&quot;, Midway&#x27;s first 3D fighting game. However, they abandoned the &quot;digital skin&quot; technique used in that game, since the new Zeus hardware allowed them to create characters with enough polygons that digital skin would offer little benefit; Zeus could generate up to 1.2 million polygons per second.

The gameplay was planned to be similar to the predecessors although this would be the first game from the series to be made in 3D. As Ed Boon was skeptical about the quality of the result noting that the gameplay would be slower than previous titles, he decided to hand-animate frames with timings in a similar fashion to &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;. Several people, including Boon and Richard DiVizio, performed fighting moves to serve as the basis for the animation.

To advertise the game, Midway organized a 35-stop road tour of the United States. The version of the game shown in the tour had nine characters, and within these nine was Noob Saibot, who would become a hidden character in the console ports only. Art director Tony Goskie created a 3D model used when any character in the game got skinned, which he called &quot;Meat&quot;. It was later decided to make Meat a secret playable character. Players first learned of the character&#x27;s given name after the text &quot;Meat lives!&quot; was placed on Ed Boon&#x27;s website promoting &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;″s third arcade revision. Years after the game&#x27;s release, Ed Boon commented that he and the staff should not have made Shinnok the final boss from the game as previous titles used enormous characters as bosses. The team opted to use an EPROM instead of a hard drive for the arcade hardware, due to the lower cost, and because it would allow the fast access time needed for familiar &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; features such as changing backgrounds in mid-fight.

== Release ==
The arcade version of &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; was released in September 1997 in North America and later that same year in Europe. The game was ported to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows. An upgraded version titled &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot; was also released exclusively for the Dreamcast. A Game Boy Color game based on &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; was released as well.

===Home consoles===
Eurocom, which had previously developed the Sega Saturn version of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, was in charge of making the console versions of the game. They worked for roughly eight months to finish the Nintendo 64 port. One of their main objectives was to have the game run at a consistent 60 frames per second. While all the traits from the arcade mode were added to the home version, Eurocom had to reduce the polygon count due to the more limited resources of the Nintendo 64. Eurocom was also assisted by Ed Boon and the lead artist on the arcade game, Dave Michicich. The port adds the Ice Pit, a snowy environment where players fight in an icy, carved-out pit. Another new feature added to these ports is a second set of alternate outfits for all characters. The arcade version provided only one set of alternate outfits which the player could unlock. The PC and PlayStation versions run FMV intro, bios and endings. The Nintendo 64 version, being a cartridge game, uses the in-game character animations to run them just like its arcade counterpart. The two platforms that offer FMV endings have a different ending for Reiko in which he goes into a portal leading to Shao Kahn&#x27;s throne room, sits on the throne and has Shao Kahn&#x27;s helmet come down onto him. In the other platforms, the ending fades to black after Reiko enters the portal.

===&quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot;===
An expanded version titled &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot; was developed by Eurocom and released in 1999 as a launch title for the Dreamcast in both regions, on September 9 on North America and on October 14 in Europe. The game contains several additional characters (Baraka, Cyrax, Kitana, Mileena, Kung Lao and hidden Sektor) and stages, as well as a new weapon select mechanism.

===Game Boy Color===
The Game Boy Color version of &quot;MK4&quot; was developed by Digital Eclipse and released by Midway. It is in 2D instead of the others&#x27; 3D. It features nine selectable characters: Raiden, Quan Chi, Fujin, Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, Reiko, Tanya, Scorpion, and the hidden character Reptile; Shinnok is still the final opponent. In addition, there are a few speech clips, and instead of using the in-game graphics for the Fatalities, the game uses short FMV clips. The Game Boy Color port&#x27;s 2D engine reuses the game engine used in the Game Boy port of &quot;MK3&quot;, including the same character select screen, &quot;Choose Your Destiny&quot; screen, and how the characters move and interact. The background music was replaced with repetitive songs that bore instrumentation befitting a Game Boy release, and the port does not contain any blood outside of the Fatality videos. The combo system and weapons were also removed.

==Reception==
Upon the start of the arcade&#x27;s road tour, news programs commented on the violence from the game and expressed concern on how it would affect the players&#x27; personalities; Ed Boon replied that there were already games more violent than &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;, which was only the most popular of the violent games and therefore the most prominent.

In reviews for the arcade version, &quot;Next Generation&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; both noted that while the graphics are in 3D, the gameplay is in the same 2D format as previous installments. Both also opined that the game had sharp graphics and a pleasing blend of old characters with strong newcomers. &quot;Next Generation&quot; called it &quot;a fast-moving, dark, and disturbing fighter that retains many of the series&#x27; best qualities.&quot; The reviewer felt the lack of genuine innovation was a major strike against it, but concluded, &quot;It may not be what we&#x27;d hoped for, but it&#x27;s much better than &quot;War Gods&quot;.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; had other misgivings, noting that version 1.0 has a number of bugs, includes only a handful of fatalities, and controls less responsively than previous games in the series. However, they found the weapons system, new characters, and foreboding music make it fresh enough to be worth playing. They gave a more unreservedly positive review to version 2.0, stating that it added true 3D movement and corrected the control issues, though the camera still had occasional problems and certain moves were too hard to block.

GameRankings had an average of 76.07% from 20 reviews for the Nintendo 64 version of the game, 75.75% with 16 reviews for the PlayStation version, and 72.14% with 14 reviews for the PC version. Although various reviewers did not find it more entertaining than previous games, they still praised the gameplay. On the other hand, the gameplay was said to be very similar to the previous &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; titles. The PlayStation and PC ports have been said to have improvements over the arcade game such as having more responsive controls and the exclusive FMV scenes. However, &quot;IGN&quot; mentioned that playing the PC port would become &quot;stale&quot; unless the player &quot;had an extra pad and a friend&quot; and the &quot;Official UK PlayStation Magazine&quot; said that the game was &quot;the same old stuff trotted out with a fresh coat of pixels. Tedious.&quot;

The Nintendo 64 port received positive response for being faithful to the arcade version, with &quot;GameSpot&quot; giving it a &quot;Great&quot; 8.9 and &quot;IGN&quot; a &quot;Great&quot; 8.8, though they noted that the graphics were not as good as those of the arcade. The game has received positive response due to the new 3D graphics, the improvement of combos, and how all the characters &quot;are still as cheesy as ever&quot; and because they still have their original movements with a few updates.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;&quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; is a guilty pleasure; although it&#x27;s unoriginal, the game is fast and rewarding. &quot;MK4&quot; is an excellent port and, though it&#x27;s average in general, it is still one of the best fighters for the console.&quot;

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PlayStation version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that &quot;Overall, &quot;MK4&quot; is by no means incompetent, and it&#x27;s a fine port of the arcade game. Had it not been released on a system teeming with great fighting games, it might stand a chance, but on PlayStation, there&#x27;s little to distinguish it.&quot;

The Game Boy Color version received poor reviews from publications such as &quot;GameSpot&quot;, whose editor Jeff Gerstmann gave it a 3.5 out of 10 due to how different the game is from the other ports and how unresponsive the controls are. Similarly &quot;IGN&quot;″s Peer Schneider criticized how limited the gameplay had become in this version and how defeating the opponent was easier. He gave the game a &quot;Poor&quot; 4.0 out of 10.

In retrospective, GamesRadar criticized the endings for the Nintendo 64 version of the game using a compilation from them for an April Fools joke, labelling them as hilarious due to their poor quality. &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; was ranked as having the third best Game Over screen of all time by &quot;GamePro&quot; in 2009. According to a summary in to the series&#x27; retrospective by IGN, &quot;With interest in ultraviolence waning, 3D becoming commonplace, and the photorealism now gone, &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; was unable to replicate the success of its predecessors.&quot; In 2020 CBR positively reviewed the game praising it for introducing &quot;weapon styles&quot; that would be featured in future games and stated that the game is &quot;still an integral part of the franchise&#x27;s history&quot;.

<text>Alberto Evaristo Ginastera (; April 11, 1916June 25, 1983) was an Argentine composer of classical music. He is considered to be one of the most important 20th-century classical composers of the Americas.

==Biography==

Ginastera was born in Buenos Aires to a Spanish father and an Italian mother. During his later years, he preferred to use the Catalan and Italian pronunciation of his surname – , with an initial soft &#x27;G&#x27; like that of English &#x27;George&#x27; – rather than with a Spanish &#x27;J&#x27; sound ().

Ginastera studied at the Williams Conservatory in Buenos Aires, graduating in 1938. As a young professor, he taught at the Liceo Militar General San Martín. After a visit to the United States in 1945–47, where he studied with Aaron Copland at Tanglewood, he returned to Buenos Aires. He held a number of teaching posts. Among his notable students were Ástor Piazzolla (who studied with him in 1941), Alcides Lanza, Jorge Antunes, Waldo de los Ríos, Jacqueline Nova, Blás Atehortua, Rafael Aponte-Ledée. 

In 1968 Ginastera moved back to the United States, and in 1970 to Europe. He died in Geneva, Switzerland, at the age of 67 and was buried in the Cimetière des Rois there.

==Music==
Ginastera grouped his music into three periods: &quot;Objective Nationalism&quot; (1934–1948), &quot;Subjective Nationalism&quot; (1948–1958), and &quot;Neo-Expressionism&quot; (1958–1983). Among other distinguishing features, these periods vary in their use of traditional Argentine musical elements. His Objective Nationalistic works often integrate Argentine folk themes in a straightforward fashion, while works in the later periods incorporate traditional elements in increasingly abstracted forms.

Many of Ginastera&#x27;s works were inspired by the &quot; Gauchesco&quot; tradition. This tradition holds that the &quot;gaucho&quot;, or landless native horseman of the plains, is a symbol of Argentina.

His &quot;Cantata para América Mágica&quot; (1960), for dramatic soprano and 53 percussion instruments, was based on ancient pre-Columbian legends. Its U.S. West Coast premiere was performed by the Los Angeles Percussion Ensemble under Henri Temianka and William Kraft at UCLA in 1963.

<text>Sandoz Group AG is a Swiss company that focuses on generic pharmaceuticals and biosimilars. Prior to October 2023, it was part of a division of Novartis that was established in 2003, when Novartis united all of its generics businesses under the name Sandoz. Before this, the company existed as an independent pharmaceutical manufacturer until 1996, when it was merged with Ciba-Geigy to form Novartis. Prior to the merger, it specialized in medicines used in organ transplants, such as Sandimmune, and various antipsychotics and migraine medicines. Its headquarters were in Holzkirchen, Germany and after the spin-off from Novartis, the headquarters moved to Basel, Switzerland. Sandoz is one of the leading global generics businesses.

== History ==
=== 1886–1995: Formation and initial growth ===
The company was founded in 1886 by Alfred Kern (1850–1893) and Edouard Sandoz (1853–1928) in Basel (Switzerland) under the name &quot;Chemiefirma Kern und Sandoz&quot;. Initially the company focused on production of dyes namely alizarin blue and auramine. When Kern died, the company changed its name to &quot;Chemische Fabrik vormals Sandoz&quot; in 1895 and began producing pharmaceuticals for the first time the same year. As early as 1895, the first pharmaceutical substance called antipyrine was produced to reduce fever. In 1899 they started producing saccharin.

In 1917, Sandoz entered pharmaceutical research when Arthur Stoll (1887–1971) was hired, and, in 1929, Calcium Sandoz was introduced, laying the foundation research into modern calcium therapy.

In 1918, Arthur Stoll isolated ergotamine from ergot; the substance was eventually used to treat migraine and headaches and was introduced under the trade name Gynergen in 1921.

In 1938 Albert Hofmann produced the synthetic substance lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as LSD. The psychoactive properties of this preparation were nevertheless not discovered until 1943, when Hofmann ingested a small amount by accident. From 1947 to the mid-60s, LSD was sold by Sandoz under the name &quot;Delysid&quot;. It was marketed as a treatment for a wide variety of mental ailments, ranging from alcoholism to sexual deviancy. Sandoz suggested in its marketing literature that psychiatrists take LSD themselves, to gain a better subjective understanding of the schizophrenic experience, and many did exactly that and so did other scientific researchers. The Sandoz product received mass publicity as early as 1954, in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine feature. Research on LSD peaked in the 1950s and early 1960s. The CIA purchased quantities of LSD from Sandoz for use in its illegal human experimentation program known as MKUltra. Sandoz withdrew the drug from the market in 1965. The drug became a cultural novelty of the 1960s after psychologist Timothy Leary at Harvard University began to promote its use for recreational and spiritual experiences among the general public.

In 1939, Kern &amp; Sandoz became Sandoz Ltd., a name it operated under for nearly sixty years.

In 1963, Sandoz acquired Biochemie GmbH, which was producing and supplying scarce, urgently needed acid-resistant penicillin.

In 1967, Sandoz merged with Wander AG and diversified into the dietetics business with Ovomaltine and Isostar.

In 1972, Sandoz acquired Delmark, Wasabröd, Wasa, the Swedish crisp bread producer Wasa in 1982.

In 1986, Velsicol Chemical Corporation acquired the agrochemicals division of Sandoz.

In 1994, Sandoz bought Gerber Products Company, expanding its research into biopharmacueticals.

In 1995, the specialty chemicals division became an independent company under the name Clariant, based in Muttenz.

=== 1996–2023: Merger with Ciba-Geigy and developments under Novartis ===
On December 20, 1996, the merger of Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy led to the creation of Novartis. The Sandoz brand name was then only used in the pharmaceutical business for over-the-counter medicines.

The former company name Sandoz was reactivated in May 2003 with the merger of the globally differently named generics companies of the parent company Novartis under the uniform brand name Sandoz. In addition to the name, the company logo used before the merger was also adopted.

In 2002, Sandoz acquired Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d., Slovenia&#x27;s largest pharmaceutical company.

In 2003, Novartis united its global generics businesses under a single global brand, reestablishing the name Sandoz as a division of Novartis. The Amifarma S.L. production plant in Palafolls, located near Barcelona, Spain was also acquired.

In February 2005, Sandoz acquired over Hexal AG and Eon Labs. The integration into Sandoz created the second largest generics group in the world and the largest on the German market with annual sales of 7.6 billion US dollars (2008) and over 23,000 employees in 130 countries. The headquarters have been in Holzkirchen since 2005. Sandoz&#x27;s Swiss administrative headquarters are in Rotkreuz ZG in the municipality of Risch in the canton of Zug.

In 2006, Omnitrope, a recombinant human growth hormone, was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and also became the first biosimilar to receive approval from the FDA.

In 2007, the first complex biosimilar, Binocrit was approved in the EU.

In 2009, Sandoz acquired EBEWE Pharma&#x27;s specialty generic injectables division and in 2010, acquired Oriel Therapeutics.

In 2012, Sandoz acquired Fougera Pharmaceuticals, entering the generic (topical) dermatology business.

In November 2018, it was announced that Novartis would convert Sandoz into an independent entity over the next two years. In March 2019, it was announced that CEO Richard Francis had resigned for personal reasons and that Francesco Balestrieri, Sandoz&#x27;s European head, had taken over management ad interim. Richard Saynor was appointed as CEO later in 2019.

In August 2022, Novartis said the spin-off of Sandoz into a standalone company would be completed by the end of 2023. As part of the spin-off, Sandoz announced in June 2023 it would move its headquarters from Holzkirchen, Germany to Basel, Switzerland.

In July 2023, Sandoz launched a biosimilar version of AbbVie Inc&#x27;s Humira, under the label, Hyrimoz.

=== 2023–present: Return to a standalone company ===

In September 2023, Novartis announced that the spin-off had been approved by its shareholders and that it would be completed by the next month, resulting in Novartis shareholders receiving one Sandoz share for every five Novartis shares. Sandoz was listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange with a market capitalization between $18 billion and $25bn.

On October 4, 2023, Novartis completed the spin-off of Sandoz as a stand-alone company.

In January 2024, Sandoz announced it would acquire biosimilar drug for vision Cimerli For $170 million from Coherus BioSciences. The acquisition was completed in March 2024.

In February 2024, Sandoz US and its subsidiary Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. - indirect subsidiaries of Sandoz Group AG reached a USD 265 million settlement agreement in the US related to a generics direct purchaser class action lawsuit.

In April 2024, Sandoz reached an agreement with Amgen to resolve all patent disputes between the two companies relating to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Sandoz denosumab biosimilars.

In November 2024, Sandoz inaugurated the new headquarters in Basel, Switzerland.

== 1986 Sandoz warehouse fire in Schweizerhalle ==
On November 1, 1986, a major fire broke out in a warehouse containing of chemicals in what was then Sandoz in Schweizerhalle. The thick smoke, the stench and the unknown composition of the combustion gases caused the authorities in the neighboring communities to alert the population early in the morning with a general siren alarm and a curfew of several hours was imposed. No people suffered acute harm, with the exception of three people with pre-existing asthma who required hospitalization. However, the toxins found their way into the Rhine via the extinguishing water, where they caused a large number of fish to die off.

On November 11, 1986, the analysis of water samples proved that at the same time as the Rhine was being polluted by the contaminated extinguishing water from the Sandoz area, 400 kg of atrazine, a herbicide, had been discharged into the Rhine from the neighboring chemical company Ciba-Geigy.

The official investigation report came to the conclusion (only &quot;on the basis of theoretical considerations&quot;) that when pallets were packed with Prussian blue, incorrect handling of a hot air blower led to a hot spot, which could be the cause. Subsequent trials, however, resulted in no conviction. The plant now belongs to Clariant.

To this day, the landfill left after the fire continues to pollute the groundwater in Muttenz and is actively monitored by Novartis, as the legal successor to Sandoz, and the environmental authorities of the Canton of Basel-Landschaft.

To commemorate the spill, there is a plastic market table by Bettina Eichin in the cloister of Basel Munster.

<doc id="590061" wikidata="Q600212" url="?curid=590061" title="Alice in Chains (album)">
<text>Alice in Chains (sometimes informally referred to as the Dog Album or Tripod) is the third studio album by American rock band Alice in Chains. It was released on October 31, 1995, by Columbia Records, and was the follow-up to the highly successful &quot;Dirt&quot; (1992). This is the band&#x27;s first full-length studio album to feature bassist Mike Inez, their last studio album to feature original lead vocalist Layne Staley, and their final studio album to be released through Columbia. 

For a year and a half, Alice in Chains had not played any live shows, citing Staley&#x27;s health issues. In the meantime, Staley joined the supergroup Mad Season and recorded the album &quot;Above&quot; (1995), leaving the future of Alice in Chains in question. In addition, Staley&#x27;s growing heroin addiction led to growing rumors of his death. Shortly after the release of &quot;Above&quot;, Alice in Chains set out to create their third album, with the intention of putting an end to the gossip surrounding the band. 

Recorded at Seattle&#x27;s Bad Animals Studio with Toby Wright, the album&#x27;s songs focus on heavy emotional content and subject matter such as drug addiction, depression, religion, broken relationships, and the internal tensions within the band fueled by Staley&#x27;s substance abuse. The album&#x27;s music relies less on metallic riffs and more on melody and texturally varied arrangements, some integrating some of the more delicate acoustic moods of their EPs, and others introducing late 1960s and early 1970s rock influences.

&quot;Alice in Chains&quot; was released in the twilight of the grunge era, and the band did not participate in any of their own touring for the album due to Staley&#x27;s ongoing addiction. The only live performances to support the release came through television appearances, one of which was recorded for MTV&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; series, as well as a brief run of shows as an opener for Kiss. Nevertheless, the album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart, and stayed on the chart for nearly a year. The tracks &quot;Grind&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; and &quot;Again&quot; were released as singles. &quot;Grind&quot; and &quot;Again&quot; were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. The album was certified double platinum by the RIAA and has sold over three million copies worldwide. The album was the band&#x27;s last for almost 14 years; Staley died from a drug overdose in 2002, and the band emerged with &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; in 2009 with new vocalist William DuVall.

==Background==
After the release of &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;, vocalist Layne Staley entered rehab for heroin addiction, and drummer Sean Kinney struggled with alcoholism. The band had been scheduled join the Shit Hits the Sheds Tour during mid-1994 with Metallica, Suicidal Tendencies, Danzig and Fight, including a stop at Woodstock &#x27;94, but while in rehearsal for the tour, Staley arrived to a practice session high. Kinney refused to perform with Staley in his condition, and the band eventually decided to cancel all their scheduled dates one day before the start of the tour. Alice in Chains&#x27; manager Susan Silver was forced to release an official statement that all the group&#x27;s live appearances for the foreseeable future had been cancelled due to health issues among the bandmembers. They were replaced by Candlebox on the tour. After the statement was released, the musicians stopped communicating with the press. Numerous rumors sprang from the cancellation, including that the band had broken up and that Staley had died from AIDS. Members of Metallica mocked Staley on the tour. The band would imitate the first verse of &quot;Man in the Box&quot;, and frontman James Hetfield replaced the lyrics with &quot;I can&#x27;t tour&quot;, while his bandmates would pretend to give themselves injections. According to Kinney, &quot;Nobody was being honest with each other back then. [...] If we had kept going, there was a good chance we would have self-destructed on the road, and we definitely didn’t want that to happen in public.&quot; 

During this period of inactivity, each of Alice in Chains&#x27; members took part in side projects. Bassist Mike Inez appeared on Slash&#x27;s solo album &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot;. Kinney and the band&#x27;s guitarist Jerry Cantrell each contributed songs to the Willie Nelson tribute album &quot;Twisted Willie&quot;; it was Cantrell&#x27;s first experience working on material outside of Alice in Chains. Cantrell then decided to work on material originally intended for a solo album, with the working title &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Kids&quot;. Staley&#x27;s direction, however, cast doubts over the future of the band when he joined what would become the &quot;grunge supergroup&quot; Mad Season, a band founded by solo artist John Baker Saunders and Pearl Jam&#x27;s Mike McCready. The brainchild of McCready, who met Saunders at a Hazelden rehab clinic, the band was intended be a project which united musicians recovering from addictions. After recruiting Screaming Trees&#x27; Barrett Martin, the three invited Staley to be their vocalist. After an October gig and several jam sessions under the name Gacy Bunch, the musicians changed their name to Mad Season and went to the studio, where they recorded &quot;Above&quot;. Mad Season&#x27;s performances at local venues in Seattle, which included some Alice in Chains songs, appeared to contradict prior reports made about Staley&#x27;s health, and fueled rumors that he had left Alice in Chains. These reports irked Cantrell, and he halted work on his solo album in favor of attempting to revive Alice in Chains.

==Production==

===Early recording and label issues===

When Jerry Cantrell first began thinking about releasing a solo album in 1994, he tried jamming with several drummers, among them Josh Snyder of Tad and Norman Scott of Gruntruck. Cantrell and Scott recorded demos of new songs at Cantrell&#x27;s in-home studio; Cantrell&#x27;s guitar tech, Darrell Peters, was at the 16-track mixing console. The two musicians improvised on guitar and drums, after which Cantrell added bass and recorded guitar overdubs. A total of three songs were written; two of the songs, &quot;Grind&quot; and &quot;Again&quot;, would appear on the upcoming Alice in Chains album. After Cantrell&#x27;s home sessions, he reunited with Inez and headed to Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, bringing along Heart&#x27;s Ann and Nancy Wilson alongside producer Toby Wright. The strategy behind these moves was that Kinney and Staley, who were disillusioned with Alice in Chains, would find out about the sessions and change their minds. Wright recalled that Cantrell was prepared for Kinney and Staley to turn the offer down, at which point he would pivot back to using the material for a solo album, despite his reluctance to do so.

The recording sessions at Bear Creek were short and unproductive; the group spent $10,000 for a week&#x27;s worth of time in the studio, but were unable to record anything other than the croaking of frogs in a nearby pond, used for the album&#x27;s eventual eleventh track &quot;Frogs&quot;. However, the reunion plan was successful; Kinney and Staley agreed to participate in the creation of a new Alice in Chains album. By January 1995, Kinney had rejoined Cantrell and Inez to work on new material; in May, Staley was invited back to join the band in the recording studio. Staley told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the group ultimately came back together because during the band&#x27;s split toward side projects, they &quot;felt like we were betraying each other.&quot; While this was happening, Sony Music — the owners of the band&#x27;s label, Columbia Records — seriously considered replacing Staley. Columbia also had Mad Season under contract; Sony weighed the merits of Staley&#x27;s condition and whether it would be better for Staley to focus on working with Mad Season. When it became known that McCready was returning to Pearl Jam, the possibility of replacing his role in Mad Season and preserving the project was also considered. However, despite the prospective profits in keeping both bands active, Sony executives ultimately decided it was not worth the risk and let Staley focus on Alice in Chains. 

Following the sessions at Bear Creek, Wright was brought back as producer for what would become the new Alice in Chains album. The band&#x27;s A&amp;R manager, Nick Terzo, who had once offered Wright a job with Alice in Chains as a sound engineer, was not pleased with the musicians&#x27; decision. Terzo considered Wright more of a technician than a producer, and also believed that a producer was obliged to find a compromise between the band and the label. Wright fully supported the band&#x27;s creative independence, which led to his selection for the production job. The band ignored Terzo and stated that they would only report directly to the heads of Sony Music, Don Ienner and Michele Anthony. Furthermore, the band barred Silver from entering the studio. Wright served as the only intermediary between the band and the management, and it was through him she learned of progress on the album. Although Wright emphasized that the idea of distancing from management belonged to the musicians, he did not oppose because he wanted the band to leave all their problems out of the studio to focus on the music. Despite the commercial success of the group&#x27;s previous works, Cantrell considered making music that would make the band&#x27;s fans happy to be the main goal, with Staley adding the band also wanted to create something the band themselves would also enjoy. Ultimately, the band was given full creative control, without a specific deadline or budget. However, when Toby Wright met Ienner in New York before the studio session began, Ienner was skeptical about the project and was sure that Wright would not be successful or productive. Wright recalled &quot;sitting in Donnie Ienner’s office in New
York before we started the record and him telling me, ‘Good luck,&#x27; because he didn&#x27;t think I’d be able to get a record out of them.&quot;

===Creative process===

Work on &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; began at Bad Animals Studio about a month after the March 1995 release of Mad Season&#x27;s &quot;Above&quot;. The band chose Bad Animals not only because of its proximity to where Staley lived, but also the greater amount of space for recording over other options. When work began, the musicians did not have any finished songs, though Cantrell had several ideas to work with from the earlier demo sessions. The band would then give the demo tapes to Staley so he could write lyrics. In the absence of completed material, the band decided to simply jam together until finding something that would work instead of spending time on pre-production, as they had done on &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;. Most often, jams began with Cantrell and Kinney, as the two had the greatest musical chemistry developed between them. Instrumental parts were recorded during live sessions with the whole band; first, the structure of the song was outlined, and then – after 15-20 performances, memorizing their parts – the musicians recorded the best takes. Wright largely relied on his own intuition when deciding when a take was good enough; some were worth leaving the first take, while others took many attempts, sometimes to the point of postponing the recording until the next day. Even then, a song could undergo significant changes: new sections could be added or old ones removed. This usually happened when fine-tuning vocal harmonies in the recordings. Staley would write lyrics to those finished recordings that he liked, and skipped the others. 

For the convenience of the musicians, Wright established a virtually round-the-clock work schedule. He accommodated the band members whenever the group was comfortable doing so in order to maximize creative efforts, as opposed to forcing a 12-hour standard work day. Staley&#x27;s addiction often led him to be late or absent for recording and rehearsal sessions, so Wright&#x27;s assistant Sam Hofstedt was given a pager to notify him when Staley was available to work, regardless of time of day. On one occasion, Wright summoned Hofstedt to the studio at 1:00 a.m. after Staley had arrived. If Staley had previously tried to hide his drug use from those around him, it became obvious during the recording of the album. Hofstedt recalled, &quot;It seemed apparent to me he was using, because when you go to lock yourself in the bathroom for a while, it’s not because you really like the bathroom.&quot; Staley was seen openly using drugs once, though it served a purpose in recording a song (which became &quot;God Am&quot;).

Bad Animals was equipped with the latest equipment, including a Solid State Logic G-Series mixing console. The recording process used 48 channels, so Wright had to plan their distribution carefully, reserving space for instruments before any other work on a song began. Sometimes, in order to save money, it was necessary to use the same track for several instruments, such as an acoustic guitar and a guitar solo; Inez called these &quot;George Martin effects&quot;. The mixing was carried out with little participation of the band, who held full faith in Wright and only approved the final result. In addition to songs, almost everything else that happened in the studio was recorded, including conversations between the musicians while working. This allowed them to experiment with and take note of various combinations of guitars, amplifiers and settings, and later choose the best result. Hofstedt estimated that over 70 rolls of magnetic tape were used with this approach, remarking years later that the budget for the tape cost roughly an entire modern album production budget.

===Instruments===

Wright&#x27;s first focus was on the drums. As with &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;, the drum kit was surrounded by a wide array of microphones: a Sennheiser MD 421 and AKG D-12 for the bass drum, AKG 414s above the kit, D-12s on the toms, and an ACG C451, Shure SM57, and Sennheiser MD 441 for the snare. Wright admitted that he considered this configuration optimal and used it on most of his recordings, not just with Alice in Chains. Sean Kinney made a point of not using a metronome during the recordings, which made the songs more &quot;living and breathing&quot;; the tempo could fluctuate slightly but noticeably in different parts of the songs, following changes in dynamics. Kinney wrote all the drum parts except for &quot;Again&quot;, which was written by Scott in the demo sessions with Cantrell. Cantrell asked Kinney to replicate Scott&#x27;s part, which forced Kinney to change his approach.

Most of Cantrell&#x27;s guitar recordings used three tracks: left and right for rhythm guitar, and one in the center for the lead part. By contrast, their previous studio album &quot;Dirt&quot; (1992) typically used six to eight guitar tracks, but Cantrell deliberately reduced their number to achieve a more natural sound. He initially played the lead part on his main G&amp;L guitar using a Bogner Fish amplifier, then followed by playing it back on another guitar with a different amplifier, where additional effects and nuances could be added. The recording also used a Marshall amplifier, a 25-watt Celestion speaker system, and a Peavey preamplifier. Aside from the G&amp;L, the guitar Cantrell most often used was a 1952 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop. The guitarist had been renting the instrument from a local shop for several years to record previous albums, until he finally managed to convince the owner to sell it. He also managed to buy an early 1960s Fender Stratocaster, which was also used on numerous occasions during the recordings. Nancy Wilson also lent Cantrell a Les Paul Junior and a twelve-string acoustic during the album&#x27;s recording. Wilson&#x27;s bandmate in Heart, Howard Leese, loaned Cantrell a set of guitar pedals. His favorite among them was the Dunlop Cry Baby wah-wah, but he also made use of another Dunlop pedal, the Rotovibe (at the end of &quot;Frogs&quot;), a Maestro Phaser, and a Sustainiac sustainer (on the chorus of &quot;God Am&quot;). 

Although most of the instruments were re-recorded at Bad Animals, some parts were taken from the demos. For example, Wright insisted on using the very first take of the guitar solo for &quot;Grind&quot; – dating back to Cantrell&#x27;s home studio sessions. Cantrell objected, long considering it unfinished and not ready. He tried to re-record it, but eventually gave in to Wright&#x27;s persuasion, and the solo was added to the final mix directly from Cantrell&#x27;s ADAT tape recorder. Also remaining unchanged was the drum part for &quot;Over Now&quot;, taken from a demo version of the song recorded at London Bridge Studios; the song&#x27;s origins dated back well before the creation of &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;.

===Vocals===

The part that took the longest to record was Staley&#x27;s vocals. This was partly due to the fact that lyrics were written after the band had already entered the studio. Staley also wanted to experiment with different performance styles and tried out several different polyphonic arrangements before committing to final recordings. He even learned to use the recording equipment himself, preferring to be alone in the control room and perform songs over a pre-produced instrumental accompaniment using a handheld microphone. Only after Staley had decided on his approach would he allow the studio staff to enter the room and begin tracking his vocals. His parts were usually recorded in one or two takes. The microphone most often used for recording vocals was a Soundelux U95, which was slightly modified by Toby Wright. A notable exception was Staley&#x27;s distorted voice on &quot;Grind,&quot; which used a 1932 Turner Crystal microphone that Wright bought at a pawn shop for ten dollars. 

The signature vocal harmonies that had become a feature of Alice in Chains&#x27; previous work were present in more abundance throughout the songs. As before, the vocalists often were not present during the tracking of each other&#x27;s parts and performed their parts separately, only listening to the finished result. Toby Wright compared Staley and Cantrell to the Lennon-McCartney duo and admitted that although he often criticized Alice in Chains&#x27; live performances, when it came to lyrics and melodies, he had nothing to complain about. 

Because of Staley&#x27;s drug use, no one knew for sure when and in what condition Staley would appear in the studio next. The question of stopping work on the album was raised numerous times, but Wright held on, sometimes organizing breaks of several days so that all of the participants in the project could rest and get emotional release from the situation. When it became apparent that the vocal recording was slowing the process, Ienner and Anthony decided to intervene. They called Staley one morning, congratulated him on the RIAA gold certification of Mad Season&#x27;s &quot;Above&quot;, and issued him an ultimatum: finish the recording in the next nine days. Wright was issued his own ultimatum: if Staley was not present at the studio each of those days, Columbia would halt production of the album. Though he responded emotionally when Wright gave him the news, Staley complied, and the album was finished in August 1995.

===Completion of recording===

During their four-month period at Bad Animals from April to August 1995, the band wrote over 25 songs. Twelve songs were selected for the final tracklist, with a total duration of 65 minutes. Several instrumental compositions did not make the cut; these recordings were sent to Columbia, and Wright believes may still be in the label&#x27;s possession, unused in Cantrell&#x27;s future solo projects. When the recording was completed, Wright was pleased with the result. The producer particularly singled out the songs &quot;Shame In You&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, &quot;Grind&quot;, and &quot;God Am&quot;, the latter of which he recommended to be released as a single. He believed that the band had released a landmark album that would not disappoint listeners. Cantrell said of the experience, &quot;It was often depressing, and getting it done felt like pulling hair out, but it was the fucking coolest thing, and I&#x27;m glad to have gone through it. I will cherish the memory forever,&quot; while Staley added, &quot;I&#x27;ll cherish it forever, too, just because this one I can remember doing.&quot;

==Music==

Stylistically, the band integrated the sounds of both &quot;Dirt&quot; and &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; on &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;, offering both heavy compositions played in lowered guitar tunings as well as acoustic approaches combining melodic harmonies with dissonant guitar riffs. This wide range of styles is displayed by the &quot;super heavy&quot; &quot;Grind&quot; and &quot;Head Creeps&quot; to the more melodic &quot;Over Now&quot;. The dark and depressive nature of the music also remained unchanged. Jerry Cantrell admitted in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; around the release of the album that &quot;Our music&#x27;s kind of about taking something ugly and making it beautiful.&quot; Despite the genre-blending, the band primarily stuck to their heavy metal roots, mixing metal with blues, rock and roll, and even punk rock. Others described the album as grunge or hard rock.

While heavy guitar sounds continued to be a hallmark of the band&#x27;s sound on &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that the record&#x27;s calmer songs and ballads, such as &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, &quot;Shame in You&quot;, &quot;Over Now&quot;, and &quot;Frogs&quot; combined the band&#x27;s signature sound with stylings similar to Cream, Crosby, Stills and Nash, and the Allman Brothers Band. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; suggested this &quot;hazier, more otherworldly aesthetic&quot; may have been the result of &quot;sleepless nights and controlled substances&quot;. Much of the music was co-written by Cantrell and one or both of Inez and Kinney during rehearsals in the studio. There were three exceptions: two of Cantrell&#x27;s songs from his home sessions, &quot;Grind&quot; and &quot;Again&quot;, were written alone, and Staley wrote &quot;Head Creeps&quot;.

The guitar sound on &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; was more natural than previous albums, with Cantrell using fewer tracks and effects; he significantly shortened and simplified his solos, more often improvising them in the studio instead of planning them out in advance. Among those guitarists who influenced him during the creation of the album included Brian May, Lindsey Buckingham, Jimi Hendrix, Tony Iommi, Jimmy Page, Robin Trower, and David Gilmour. As was typical with the band&#x27;s full-length recordings, most of the songs were recorded in drop D. There were three songs which made it onto the album, however, which deviated from this tuning and used an open tuning: &quot;Shame In You&quot;, &quot;Nothin&#x27; Song&quot; and &quot;Over Now&quot;. This approach, which Cantrell had never utilized before, was conceived after a guitar he had loaned a friend was returned to him tuned that way.

Staley&#x27;s vocal style on &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; differed significantly from the band&#x27;s previous albums, using effects liberally. For instance, he employed a pitch shifter alongside several layers of vocals on &quot;Sludge Factory&quot;, and distortion on &quot;Head Creeps&quot; added a distinctive buzzing sound to his voice, reminiscent of a beehive. According to &quot;Ground Control&quot;, &quot;syllables are spat regularly, some letters are almost hissed through...he sounds almost feral and it&#x27;s more eerie and surreal.&quot; Cantrell sang lead vocals on three songs: &quot;Grind&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, and &quot;Over Now&quot;, all of which he also wrote lyrics to. He originally did not wish to contribute lead vocals as much as he did, but Staley and the others insisted he sing on these tracks.

==Lyrics==

Alice in Chains was already known for their depressing lyrics, raising themes of drug addiction, despair, social alienation and isolation, loneliness, and disappointment. The band reprised their dark lyrical character on &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;, but introspective misery was mostly replaced by bitter, more vindictive attitudes; Jon Pareles of the &quot;New York Times&quot; framed the lyrics envisioning &quot;most of the outside world as gossiping, two-faced persecutors&quot;, likening it to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;HIStory&quot; (1995). Although the lyricist at times displayed the band&#x27;s conventional themes, occasionally even admitting his guilt, such as in &quot;Shame in You&quot;, most often he was angry at those around him, blaming his friends, loved ones, and the media for his troubles. On &quot;Grind&quot;, Cantrell wrote that he wished &quot;to hear the sound of a body breaking when I knock you down&quot;, while Staley denounces rumors spread by the media as &quot;lackeys&#x27; loose talk for fact&quot; on &quot;Head Creeps&quot;.

Cantrell also wrote the lyrics for the songs for which he sang lead vocals. &quot;Grind&quot; was written during his solo recording session with Scott, and is a response to rumors involving Staley&#x27;s death and the band&#x27;s breakup. Cantrell thus summarized it as a &quot;&#x27;Fuck you for saying something about my life&#x27; song.&quot; &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; was written after the end of Cantrell&#x27;s seven year relationship with his girlfriend. On the liner notes of Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set, Cantrell described the song as an attempt to come to terms with the fact that his personal life caused the two to split; he added, &quot;All the things I write about her are a way for me to maybe speak to her, express things I could never express.&quot; &quot;Over Now&quot; deals with the complexities of the band&#x27;s personal relationships. The chorus asks the question and addresses the band members: &quot;Could you stand right here, look me straight in the eye and say that it&#x27;s over now?&quot; According to Cantrell, when he asked the band members this, they could not ultimately break up.

The rest of the lyrics were written by Staley, whose lyrics consisted of &quot;whatever was on [his] mind&quot;. He did not actively seek inspiration from outside sources, ignoring the media, instead relying on his emotions and the world around him in the moment. Staley described this to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;[recording] a few months of being human.&quot; By the end of the prolonged recording process, where Staley wrote all his lyrics, he was finding it increasingly difficult to write lyrics, and in the same &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, he admitted that if he had been asked to sing the new songs, he would not have been able to do so because he did not remember his own lyrics. The singer was in poor health, suffering from ever-increasing heroin use and having lost a significant amount of weight. This consequently inspired lyrics filled with despair and thoughts of death from his addiction; other songs touch on themes of fame obsession and relationships.

In &quot;Brush Away&quot;, he wondered whether the band and their work was being taken seriously, or if they were considered a joke or fad, while &quot;God Am&quot; asks a higher power why it was passively watching cruelty and heartlessness. &quot;Sludge Factory&quot; was written about the ultimatum call Staley and Wright received from Ienner and Anthony. The two told Staley and Wright they had nine days to finish the record, because they had already taken a lot of studio time, and Staley references this directly. &quot;Nothin&#x27; Song&quot;, which was written in the latter part of the recording phase, comprised the first thoughts that came to Staley&#x27;s mind. This included the line &quot;Sam, throw away your cake&quot;; addressing Hofstedt. While the band was in the studio working on the album, Hofstedt&#x27;s birthday passed, and he was given a cake in the shape of a naked woman. The cake was never finished, and lay partially eaten for at least a month.

Reflecting on the album in a 2018 interview to &quot;Noisey&quot;, Cantrell said:

==Packaging==
Work on the artwork for &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; began immediately after the recording of the album was completed. The concept was conceived by Kinney; the front cover features a three-legged dog, similar to one which chased him in his childhood when he was working as a paperboy. The back features a photograph of sideshow performer Frank Lentini, who had three legs, playing a mandolin. The shot of Lentini was taken from an exhibition of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;. The number three was symbolic of multiple things to the band: it was the band&#x27;s first full length studio album in three years after &quot;Dirt&quot;, and represented rumors of Staley&#x27;s death, thereby being only three remaining band members. In the words of &quot;Ground Control&quot;, &quot;signs that something is just not right appear everywhere both on and in Alice in Chains;&quot; they go on to detail how the album&#x27;s booklet demonstrates with &quot;images of ghastly, contorted fairies with no flesh on their arms, sinister, personified bottles swimming through black oceans, cartoons of mutant animals standing on trial, [and] synthetic limbs&quot; among other unsettling images.

The band&#x27;s photographer, Rocky Schenck, did a casting for three-legged dogs for the album&#x27;s cover art, including one in downtown Los Angeles on August 23, 1995. Staley and Cantrell were unsatisfied with the result, and the group ended up choosing a fax with the image of a three-legged dog as the cover art instead. Staley and Cantrell thought the faxed image looked grittier and was thus more appropriate for the album. The photo of the dog shot by Schenck was finally used on the 1999 box set &quot;Music Bank&quot;. Another three-legged dog named Sunshine appeared in the music video for &quot;Grind&quot;; contrary to rumor, none of the dogs used for the photoshoot, music video, or album cover belonged to Cantrell.

Kinney originally suggested naming the album &quot;Tripod&quot;, after the dog that followed him as a child and inspired the album&#x27;s cover art. The rest of the band did not like the name, but no other ideas were suggested, so it was decided to self-title the album. Though the name was not official, the self-titled effort gained the nickname &quot;Tripod&quot; anyway. It also has been referred to as the &quot;Dog Album&quot; or &quot;Dog Record&quot;.

The band&#x27;s Japanese distributor was not receptive to the artistic meaning behind the cover art and objected to its release, believing the band was mocking injured animals. When &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; was finally released in Japan, the art for the album had been replaced with a blank, white cover with the dark blue text &quot;Alice In Chains&quot; appearing inside of a dark blue border in the bottom-right corner.

==Release==

&quot;Grind&quot; was released as the first single from the album on October 6, 1995. It was chosen for its heaviness, perceived musical appeal, and its lyrics, which urged the band not to be written off despite press reports relating to their turmoil. A bootlegged, unfinished version of the song had already leaked, and the song was released earlier than planned to combat the spread of the bootleg. The song peaked at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart (later called Mainstream Rock Tracks), and number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. 

On October 31, &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; was formally released on vinyl; CD and cassette copies were available on November 7. The album debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, moving 189,000 copies in its first week; it stayed on the chart for 46 weeks. It has since been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In January 1996, Cantrell claimed that the band would tour in support of the album, but the members later opted not to tour, adding to the rumors of Staley&#x27;s drug abuse. When asked about the frustration of not touring to support the record, Cantrell provided some insight into how Staley&#x27;s addictions led to repercussive tensions within the band: &quot;We rode the good times together, and we stuck together through the hard times. We never stabbed each other in the back and spilled our guts and do that kind of bullshit that you see happen a lot.&quot;

&quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single on January 29, 1996. &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; peaked at number 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart, at that time becoming Alice in Chains&#x27; second-highest charting domestic single after &quot;No Excuses&quot;. &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; also peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and at number six on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; was quickly followed by &quot;Again&quot;, which by mid-February had already been added to rock radio; it peaked at No. 8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It also peaked at No. 36 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

==Promotion==
===The Nona Tapes===

To help promote the album, Columbia asked the band to create an electronic press kit. Normally, the band would talk about themselves and their work, but the group instead chose to create a mockumentary in the style of Spinal Tap, titled &quot;The Nona Tapes&quot;. Directed by Schenck, the project fictionalized how the band members spent their free time when they were not working. Cantrell portrayed two characters: as himself, he was shown shoveling manure at a horse stable, but for most of the project, he was disguised as a female journalist, Nona Weissbaum. Weissbaum&#x27;s character takes a car ride around Seattle, interviewing the other three members of Alice in Chains. Kinney performed as Bozo the Clown, and was later filmed drinking at a bar in-costume. Inez was portrayed as a member of the band against his will, with his family held at ransom by the rest of the band; however, when he supposedly read in a magazine that his band had split, he started running a hot dog stand in downtown Seattle. Staley was shown digging through a dumpster; his interview responses were overdubbed with different responses than were recorded. The editing was Staley&#x27;s idea.

Schenck considered the work one of the best experiences of all those he had with the band. Creating &quot;The Nona Tapes&quot; also convinced Schenck that the musicians could have also been good actors had they wished to be, and mentioned this to several directors he knew. The band had previously appeared in film scenes, including a cameo on Cameron Crowe&#x27;s 1992 production &quot;Singles&quot;; Cantrell would go on to make a cameo appearance on Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; in 1996, but aside from that, the band members were never seriously interested. 

Conversely, Columbia did not like &quot;The Nona Tapes&quot; at first, and considered it a waste of money. However, Columbia decided to sell it after the project became a cult hit, despite the band&#x27;s objection. The video was released on VHS in December 1995.

===Television performances===
Although the band did not embark on an official concert tour to support the album, the band was invited to do several individual performances. This started with an offer to do a segment for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, which the group declined several times before accepting. The program featured bands performing concerts open to the public, with entirely acoustic setlists that were taped by MTV. The show took place on April 10, 1996, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Majestic Theater. Ienner, Anthony, and the members of Metallica were among those in attendance. The performance aired on MTV on May 28, and Wright was brought back to edit the live album associated with the concert.

The taping of the show, released as the live album &quot;Unplugged&quot;, was released on July 17, 1996, and debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was the first live performance the band held in over two years, and the band&#x27;s only concert in promotion of &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; where they were the main event. The band would never perform another headlining show with Staley. The &quot;Unplugged&quot; version of &quot;Over Now&quot; was released as a promotional single in July 1996.

In the interim of the &quot;Unplugged&quot; performance and its television debut, the band made appearances on other television programs. On April 20, the band was a guest on &quot;Saturday Night Special&quot;, where they performed an electric version of &quot;Again&quot; for the first time. The band was introduced by actor Max Perlich, who had appeared in the band&#x27;s music video for &quot;No Excuses&quot;. On May 10, the band was the musical guest on &quot;the Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, where they performed a medley of &quot;Again&quot; and &quot;We Die Young&quot;.

===Opening for Kiss and aftermath===
In what would be their final live performances during their original run, the band took an opening slot on a classic lineup reunion tour for Kiss. Titled the Alive/Worldwide Tour, Alice in Chains&#x27; opening slot was originally held by Stone Temple Pilots, but their vocalist, Scott Weiland, had drug issues of his own to address. The slot was instead awarded to Alice in Chains when Weiland entered rehabilitation. The tour began on June 28, 1996, in Detroit, at the Tiger Stadium. Alex Coletti, who had produced the band&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; performance, and Billy Corgan, frontman of the Smashing Pumpkins, were both in attendance at the Detroit show and praised their performance. However, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; reported that Staley appeared physically unhealthy from the first show of the run.

The band played four shows in total for the tour, making stops in Louisville and St. Louis, before a final stop in Kansas City on July 3. Silver, sitting backstage, had speculated with the band&#x27;s tour manager that it would be the band&#x27;s final live performance. During this performance, Kinney stood from his drum set, and began to sing Kiss&#x27; &quot;Beth&quot;, which in its original form had also been sung by the band&#x27;s drummer, Peter Criss. The crowd was divided, with Kinney receiving both cheers and boos in equal measure; Kinney addressed that he was not wearing the proper makeup, and jokingly told off the audience, before the band moved into their next song. The Kansas City show would, in fact, be Staley&#x27;s final live performance. After the show, Staley overdosed and was rushed to a Kansas City hospital. Although the band&#x27;s appearance on the tour was brief, they ended up being part of the most commercially successful tour of 1996, grossing $43.6 million by the end of the year.

The group&#x27;s only further activity with Staley was when they recorded two new songs, &quot;Get Born Again&quot; and &quot;Died&quot; in 1998. After that, Staley rarely left his condominium in Seattle. It was there where he died on April 5, 2002 from another drug overdose. The band would not emerge until 2005, at first to play a benefit show. When the band decided a few months later that they wished to tour again, the band brought in Comes With the Fall vocalist William DuVall as Staley&#x27;s successor in 2006. DuVall had been in the audience at the Louisville show during their tour with Kiss nearly a decade prior, and it took nearly 14 years for the band to follow up &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; with &quot;Black Gives Way to Blue&quot; in 2009.

==Reception==
&quot;Alice in Chains&quot; was noted by some for being a musical progression for the band, with certain critics specifically noting a break away from the grunge label that had been affixed to the group. In contrast to their previous albums, Jon Pareles remarked in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; contrasted the raw distortions associated with grunge, instead sounding &quot;cleanly delineated and meticulously layered.&quot; Jon Wiederhorn of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; highlighted heavy influence from &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; and praised the lyrical honesty throughout the album. Noting that the songs &quot;achieve a startling, staggering and palpable impact&quot;, he concluded that the album was a &quot;musical rebirth&quot; for the band. Conversely, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Paul Verna wrote that the album returns to the band&#x27;s already well-known grunge sound and would thus be a hit with the band&#x27;s core fans. However, he still acknowledged the band&#x27;s more acoustic arrangements present on the album, likening them to &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; and the band&#x27;s alternative rock peers R.E.M. &quot;People&quot; enthusiastically praised Staley and Cantrell&#x27;s performances on the recording, and claimed the &quot;eerily compelling&quot; music would fit well in a horror film, especially one by Wes Craven or Clive Barker. In a review of Alice in Chains&#x27; discography, Bill Adams of &quot;Ground Control Magazine&quot; appreciated how the tracks on &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; provided retrospective insight on the band&#x27;s fragile situation, and consequently comprised &quot;twelve of the best [tracks] that the band has ever done&quot;. 

Others found the record&#x27;s sound to be dated or uninteresting. Nisid Hajari had similar observations to Verna, but was less enthusiastic in his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. He noted that fans would quickly embrace &quot;Alice in Chains&quot;, but dismissed most of the project as &quot;a sludgy stew of cookie-cutter riffs and self-indulgent, introspective noodling rock,&quot; mentioning &quot;Head Creeps&quot; as a standout track. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Cheo H. Coker found the album formulaic, but marked &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot; as a high point for the record, lamenting that the band did not take more risks during production. In contrast to Terzo&#x27;s opinion of Wright, Allmusic&#x27;s Steve Huey remarked that &quot;Alice in Chains&quot; was the band&#x27;s most well-produced record, placing &quot;Grind&quot;, &quot;Brush Away&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, and &quot;Over Now&quot; among the band&#x27;s best tracks. Despite this, he felt that &quot;[the album] should have turned out better than it did&quot;, mentioning that portions of the album were &quot;undercrafted&quot; and led to some forgettable recordings. Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, Gina Arnold noted how grunge had become tiresome in mainstream media in the wake of punk rock bands such as the Offspring, and that the album failed to make itself stand out from the group&#x27;s previous efforts. The review published by Roy Wilkinson in &quot;Select&quot; was more negative. &quot;Select&quot; was a British publication, and grunge was largely rejected by the United Kingdom and its musical artists. Sharing much of the same sentiment, Wilkinson panned the album as poorly imitating Black Sabbath, alongside criticizing the lyrics as bearing &quot;the kind of banally pompous ire that makes a tabloid-hunted Michael Hutchence seem witheringly accurate.&quot;

&quot;Grind&quot; and &quot;Again&quot; were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996 and 1997, respectively. The music video for &quot;Again&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Video at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards.

<text>Seder Zeraim (, lit. &quot;Order of Seeds&quot;) is the first of the six orders, or major divisions, of the Mishnah, Tosefta, and the Talmud, and, apart from the first tractate which concerns the rules for prayers and blessings, primarily deals with the laws of agricultural produce and tithes of the Torah which apply in the Land of Israel, in both their religious and social aspects.

==Topics==
Zeraim deals principally with the religious and social aspects of the agricultural laws of the Torah. It explains and elaborates upon the Torah commandments regarding to the rights of the poor and of the Kohens and Levites to the produce of the harvest, as well as the rules and regulations concerning the cultivation and sowing of fields, gardens and orchards. These laws are dealt with in eleven tractates, each of which concerns a separate aspect of the general subject for which this Order is named. The first tractate, Berakhot, concerns the daily prayers and blessings that observant Jews are obligated to recite.

One explanation for the inclusion of the tractate Berakhot, whose topic is seemingly quite different from the remainder of the tractates of the Order is given in the Talmud itself (Shabbat 31a), by Shimon ben Lakish, who homiletically states that the first of the six terms in a verse in Isaiah () – the word &quot;emunah&quot; &quot;faith&quot; corresponds to Seder Zeraim. This designation is seen as addressing how regulations regarding prayers and blessings – and especially those concerning the recital of the Shema Yisrael – the emblematic Jewish declaration of faith in the One God – came to be grouped with agricultural laws, which are seen both as an expression of faith through reliance on God and, according to Rashi, the foremost Talmudic commentator (1040 – 1105 CE), as an expression of faithfulness in social relationships, by providing their respective dues to the poor and the Kohens and Levites as described in the other tractates of this Order.

==Content ==
Seder Zeraim comprises eleven tractates, with a total of 74 chapters, as follows:

* Berakhot &quot;Blessings&quot;, consists of nine chapters and deals with the rules for daily prayer, particularly the &quot;Shema&quot; and the &quot;Amidah&quot;, and other blessings and prayers said before and after eating, and on other occasions.
* Pe&#x27;ah (&quot;Corner&quot;), has eight chapters and deals with the commandments concerning the gifts to the poor from the produce of the land, namely from the corners of the field which must be left to the poor, gleanings, and forgotten produce assigned to them, as specified in the Torah , and (), and with the topic of charity and rights of the poor in general.
* Demai (&quot;Doubtfully Tithed Produce&quot;), has seven chapters and deals with cases in which it is uncertain that tithes have been set aside from produce for the Kohanim (priests) and Levites.
* Kil&#x27;ayim (&quot;Mixed Species&quot;), has nine chapters and deals with rules regarding forbidden mixtures in agriculture, clothing and animal breeding, as specified in and .
* Shevi&#x27;it (&quot;Seventh Year&quot;) has ten chapters which deal with the agricultural and fiscal regulations concerning the Sabbatical Year, and the remission of debts, as specified in , and 
* Terumot (&quot;Donations&quot;) comprises eleven chapters dealing with the laws regarding the &quot;terumah&quot; donation given to the Kohanim, as specified in , .
* Ma&#x27;aserot or Ma&#x27;aser Rishon (&quot;Tithes&quot; or &quot;First Tithes&quot;) has five chapters concerning the rules regarding the tithe to be given to the Levites as specified in .
* Ma&#x27;aser Sheni (&quot;Second Tithe&quot;), comprising five chapters, deals with the rules concerning the tithe or its equivalent which was to be eaten in Jerusalem in the first, second, fourth and sixth years of the seven-year agricultural cycle culminating in the Sabbatical Year and as mandated by the Torah, as stated in .
* Hallah (&quot;Dough&quot;) comprises four chapters that deal with the laws regarding the offering of dough to be given to the Kohanim as specified in .
* Orlah (&quot;First Fruits of Trees&quot;) with three chapters deals chiefly with the prohibitions on the use of a tree for the first three years after it has been planted, as specified in and the requirements regarding the fruit of the fourth year.
* Bikkurim (&quot;First Fruits&quot;) has three chapters with the laws concerning the first-fruit gifts to the Kohanim and the Temple and a description of the donation ceremony, as specified in and .

==Structure==
Zeraim is the first &quot;seder&quot; (order or division) of the Mishnah, in accordance with the traditional order specified by Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish in the Talmud (Shabbat 31a), although Rabbi Tanhuma suggests in the Midrash (Bamidbar Rabbah 13:15–16) that another tradition has Zeraim as the second order of the Mishnah.

Seder Zeraim differs from the general pattern of the other orders that the tractates are arranged in descending order of the number of chapters and, in fact, according to an early tradition, Shevi’it and Kil&#x27;ayim come between Terumot and Ma&#x27;aserot. There is also evidence that Demai was placed between Kilayim and Ma&#x27;aserot.

In many editions of the Mishnah, even early ones like those of Naples (1492), and of Riva (1559), as well as in most of the editions of the Babylonian Talmud, a fourth chapter, which is likely a Baraita, has been added to Bikkurim. The sequence of the volumes of Zeraim in both editions (as above) corresponds with that given by Maimonides.

==Talmud==

Zeraim was compiled and edited between 200–220 CE by Rabbi Yehudah haNasi and his colleagues, as part of the Mishnah, the first major composition of Jewish law and ethics based on the Oral Torah. Subsequent generations produced a series of commentaries and deliberations relating to the Mishnah, known as the &quot;Gemara&quot;. These together with the Mishnah compose the &quot;Talmud&quot;: one produced in the Land of Israel 300–350 CE (the Jerusalem Talmud); and a second, more extensive Talmud compiled in Babylonia and published 450–500 CE (the Babylonian Talmud).

For Zeraim, in the Babylonian Talmud, there is Gemara – rabbinical commentary and analysis – only for tractate Berakhot. In the Jerusalem Talmud there is a Gemara for all the tractates of Zeraim, as the laws with which they deal mostly concern the Land of Israel, where this Talmud was compiled and these laws were applicable.

<text>Itraconazole, sometimes abbreviated ITZ, is an antifungal medication used to treat a number of fungal infections. This includes aspergillosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. It may be given by mouth or intravenously.
Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, and headache. Severe side effects may include liver problems, heart failure, Stevens–Johnson syndrome and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. It is unclear if use during pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It is in the triazole family of medications. It stops fungal growth by affecting the cell membrane or affecting their metabolism.
Itraconazole was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1992. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

Recent research works suggest itraconazole (ITZ) could also be used in the treatment of cancer by inhibiting the hedgehog pathway in a similar way to sonidegib.

==Medical uses==
Itraconazole has a broader spectrum of activity than fluconazole (but not as broad as voriconazole or posaconazole). In particular, it is active against &quot;Aspergillus&quot;, which fluconazole is not. It is also licensed for use in blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, histoplasmosis, and onychomycosis. Itraconazole is over 99% protein-bound and has virtually no penetration into cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, it should not be used to treat meningitis or other central nervous system infections. According to the Johns Hopkins Abx Guide, it has &quot;negligible CSF penetration, however treatment has been successful for cryptococcal and coccidioidal meningitis&quot;.

It is also prescribed for systemic infections, such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis, where other antifungal drugs are inappropriate or ineffective.

Itraconazole has been explored as an anticancer agent for patients with basal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and prostate cancer, For example, in a phase II study involving men with advanced prostate cancer, high-dose itraconazole (600 mg/day) was associated with significant PSA responses and a delay in tumor progression. Itraconazole also showed activity in a phase II trial in men with non-small cell lung cancer when it was combined with the chemotherapy agent, pemetrexed. A recent review also highlights its use topically and orally in conjunction with other chemotherapeutic agents for advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinomas that cannot be treated surgically.

===Available forms===
Itraconazole is produced as blue capsules with tiny blue pellets inside. Each capsule contains 100 mg and is usually taken twice a day at twelve-hour intervals. The Sporanox brand of itraconazole has been developed and marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutica, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson. The three-layer structure of these blue capsules is complex because itraconazole is insoluble and is sensitive to pH. The complicated procedure not only requires a specialized machine to create it, but also the method used has manufacturing problems. Also, the pill is quite large, making it difficult for many patients to swallow. Parts of the processes of creating Sporanox were discovered by the Korean Patent Laid-open No. 10-2001-2590. The tiny blue pellets contained in the capsule are manufactured in Beerse, Belgium.

The oral solution is better absorbed. The cyclodextrin contained in the oral solution can cause an osmotic diarrhea, and if this is a problem, then half the dose can be given as oral solution and half as capsule to reduce the amount of cyclodextrin given. &quot;Sporanox&quot; itraconazole capsules should always be taken with food, as this improves absorption, however the manufacturers of &quot;Lozanoc&quot; assert that it may be taken &quot;without regard to meals&quot;. Itraconazole oral solution should be taken an hour before food, or two hours after food (and likewise if a combination of capsules and oral solution are used). Itraconazole may be taken with orange juice or cola, as absorption is also improved by acid. Absorption of itraconazole is impaired when taken with an antacid, H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor.

==Side effects==
Itraconazole is a relatively well-tolerated drug (although not as well tolerated as fluconazole or voriconazole) and the range of adverse effects it produces is similar to the other azole antifungals:
* elevated alanine aminotransferase levels are found in 4% of people taking itraconazole
* &quot;small but real risk&quot; of developing congestive heart failure
* liver failure, sometimes fatal

The cyclodextrin used to make the syrup preparation can cause diarrhea. Side effects that may indicate a greater problem include:
* nausea
* vomiting
* abdominal pain
* fatigue
* loss of appetite
* yellow skin (jaundice)
* yellow eyes
* itching
* dark urine
* pale stool
* headache
==Interactions==
The following drugs should not be taken with itraconazole:
* amiodarone (Cordarone);
* cisapride
* dofetilide
* nisoldipine
* alcohol
* pimozide
* quinidine
* lurasidone
* lovastatin or simvastatin
* midazolam or triazolam
* ergot medicines such as
** dihydroergotamine
** ergometrine
** ergotamine
** methylergonovine
==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
The mechanism of action of itraconazole is the same as the other azole antifungals: it inhibits the fungal-mediated synthesis of ergosterol, via inhibition of lanosterol 14α-demethylase. Because of its ability to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 CC-3, caution should be used when considering interactions with other medications.

Itraconazole is pharmacologically distinct from other azole antifungal agents in that it is the only inhibitor in this class that has been shown to inhibit both the hedgehog signaling pathway and angiogenesis. These distinct activities are unrelated to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase and the exact molecular targets responsible remain unidentified. Functionally, the antiangiogenic activity of itraconazole has been shown to be linked to inhibition of glycosylation, VEGFR2 phosphorylation, trafficking, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways. Evidence suggests the structural determinants for inhibition of hedgehog signaling by itraconazole are recognizably different from those associated with antiangiogenic activity.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Itraconazole, like cyclosporine, quinidine, and clarithromycin, can inhibit P-glycoprotein, causing drug interactions by reducing elimination and increasing absorption of organic cation drugs. With conventional itraconazole preparations serum levels can vary greatly between patients, often resulting in serum concentrations lower than the therapeutic index. It has therefore been conventionally advised that patients take itraconazole after a fatty meal rather than prior to eating.

A product (Lozanoc) licensed through the European union decentralised procedure has increased bioavailability, decreased sensitivity to co ingestion of food, and hence decreased variability of serum levels.

==Chemistry==
The itraconazole molecule has three chiral carbons. The two chiral centers in the dioxolane ring are fixed in relation to one another, and the triazolomethylene and aryloxymethylene dioxolane-ring substituents are always &quot;cis&quot; to each other. The clinical formulation is a 1:1:1:1 mixture of four stereoisomers (two enantiomeric pairs).

== History ==
Itraconazole was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992.

It was designated an orphan drug by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).

<doc id="590076" wikidata="Q593282" url="?curid=590076" title="Big Time (Tom Waits album)">
<text>Big Time is the first conventional live album by American musician Tom Waits, featuring performances from two shows on Waits&#x27; 1987 tour. The album was released less than a year later on Island Records. While &quot;Big Time&quot; was the first released recording of public concert performances by Waits, it was not strictly his first live release: his 1975 &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot; was a live performance before an audience that was conducted entirely within a recording studio.

==Background and production==
In efforts to promote &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot;, Waits began a historic tour of North America and Europe in October 1987. The tour incorporated a theatrical aspect, as &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot; was based on a play written by Waits about his then-alter-ego, Frank O&#x27;Brien, who debuted on the track &quot;Frank&#x27;s Wild Years&quot;on &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;. Waits described O&#x27;Brien as:
&quot;Quite a guy. Grew up in a bird&#x27;s eye frozen, oven-ready, rural American town where Bing, Bob, Dean, Wayne &amp; Jerry are considered major constellations. Frank, mistakenly, thinks he can stuff himself into their shorts and present himself to an adoring world. He is a combination of Will Rogers and Mark Twain, playing accordion -- but without the wisdom they possessed. He has a poet&#x27;s heart and a boy&#x27;s sense of wonder with the world. A legend in Rainville since he burned his house down and took off for the Big Time.&quot;

The theatrical play, which premiered on June 17, 1986 at Chicago&#x27;s Briar Street Theatre, ran for two months and received &quot;mixed reviews&quot;.

Five of the final shows in North America were held at San Francisco&#x27;s Warfield Theatre and Los Angeles&#x27; Wiltern Theatre in November 1987, shortly before Waits and his band left for Europe. Waits and his wife Kathleen Brennan then proposed the idea of releasing the recorded live footage as a concert film. Originally titled &quot;Crooked Time&quot;, Brennan played a large role in the development and eventual production of the idea.

During post-production of both the album and movie, Waits&#x27; voice was lowered in tone, apparently as both he and the producers wanted to &quot;give more power to the songs.&quot; Several audio effects – such as the stamping of boots, finger snapping, maracas, gunshots, train whistles, traffic noise, laughter and applause – were also added in post-production. Additional footage from European performances in Dublin, Stockholm and Berlin was also added.

<doc id="590078" wikidata="Q1195034" url="?curid=590078" title="Moed">
<text>Moed (, &quot;Festivals&quot;) is the second Order of the Mishnah, the first written recording of the Oral Torah of the Jewish people (also the Tosefta and Talmud). Of the six orders of the Mishna, Moed is the third shortest. The order of Moed consists of 12 tractates:

# Shabbat: or Shabbath () (&quot;Sabbath&quot;) deals with the 39 prohibitions of &quot;work&quot; on the Shabbat. 24 chapters.
# Eruvin: (ערובין) (&quot;Mixtures&quot;) deals with the Eruv or Sabbath-bound - a category of constructions/delineations that alter the domains of the Sabbath for carrying and travel. 10 chapters.
# Pesahim: (פסחים) (&quot;Passover Festivals&quot;) deals with the prescriptions regarding the Passover and the paschal sacrifice. 10 chapters.
# Shekalim: (שקלים) (&quot;Shekels&quot;) deals with the collection of the half-Shekel as well as the expenses and expenditure of the Temple. 8 chapters
# Yoma: (יומא) (&quot;The Day&quot;); called also &quot;Kippurim&quot; or &quot;Yom ha-Kippurim&quot; (&quot;Day of Atonement&quot;); deals with the prescriptions Yom Kippur, especially the ceremony by the Kohen Gadol. 8 chapters.
# Sukkah: (סוכה) (&quot;Booth&quot;); deals with the festival of Sukkot (the Feast of Tabernacles) and the Sukkah itself. Also deals with the Four Species (Lulav, Etrog, Hadass, Aravah — Palm branch, Citron, Myrtle, Willow) which are waved on Sukkot. 5 chapters.
# Beitza: (ביצה) (&quot;Egg&quot;); (So called from the first word, but originally termed, according to its subject, &quot;Yom Tov&quot; - &quot;Holidays&quot;) deals chiefly with the rules to be observed on Yom Tov. 5 chapters.
# Rosh Hashanah: (ראש השנה) (&quot;New Year&quot;) deals chiefly with the regulation of the calendar by the new moon, and with the services of the festival of Rosh Hashanah. 4 chapters.
# Ta&#x27;anit: (תענית) (&quot;Fasting&quot;) deals chiefly with the special fast-days in times of drought or other untoward occurrences. 4 chapters
# Megillah: (מגילה) (&quot;Scroll&quot;) contains chiefly regulations and prescriptions regarding the reading of the scroll of Esther at Purim, and the reading of other passages from the Torah and Neviim in the synagogue. 4 chapters.
# Mo&#x27;ed Katan: (מועד קטן) (&quot;Little Festival&quot;) deals with Chol HaMoed, the intermediate festival days of Pesach and Sukkot. 3 chapters.
# Hagigah: (חגיגה) (&quot;Festival Offering&quot;) deals with the Three Pilgrimage Festivals (Passover, Shavuot, Sukkot) and the pilgrimage offering that men were supposed to bring in Jerusalem. 3 chapters.

The Jerusalem Talmud has a Gemara on each of the tractates, while in the Babylonian, only that on Shekalim is missing. However, in most printed editions of the Babylonian Talmud (as well as the Daf Yomi cycle), the Jerusalem Gemara to Shekalim is included.

In the Babylonian Talmud the treatises of the order Mo&#x27;ed are arranged as follows: &quot;Shabbat, &#x27;Erubin, Pesachim, Rosh ha-Shanah, Yoma, Sukkah, Beitzah, Hagigah, Mo&#x27;ed Katan, Ta&#x27;anit, Megillah&quot;; while the sequence in the Jerusalem Talmud is &quot;Shabbat, Eruvin, Pesachim, Yoma, Sheqalim, Sukkah, Rosh ha-Shanah, Beitzah, Ta&#x27;anit, Megillah, Hagigah, Mo&#x27;ed&#x27; Katan.&quot;

On the Festivals, some have the custom to learn the Tractate in this Order which details the laws of that respective festival. (e.g. they would learn Tractate Rosh Hashanah on the holiday of Rosh Hashanah).</text><links>

<text>The Government Pension Fund of Norway () is the sovereign wealth fund collective owned by the government of Norway. It consists of two entirely separate sovereign wealth funds: the Government Pension Fund Global and the Government Pension Fund Norway.

The Government Pension Fund Global (&quot;Statens pensjonsfond utland&quot;), also known as the Oil Fund (&quot;Oljefondet&quot;), was established in 1990 to invest the surplus revenues of the Norwegian petroleum sector. it had over US$1.74 trillion in assets, and held on average 1.5% of all of the world&#x27;s listed companies, making it the world&#x27;s largest single sovereign wealth fund in terms of total assets under management. This translates to over US$325,000 per Norwegian citizen. It also holds portfolios of real estate and fixed-income investments. Many companies are excluded by the fund on ethical grounds.

The Government Pension Fund Norway is smaller and was established in 1967 as a type of national insurance fund. It is managed separately from the Oil Fund and is limited to domestic and Nordic investments and is therefore a key stock holder in many large Norwegian companies, predominantly via the Oslo Stock Exchange.

==Government Pension Fund Global==
The Government Pension Fund Global (, SPU) is a fund into which the surplus wealth produced by Norwegian petroleum income is deposited. Its name changed in January 2006 from the Petroleum Fund of Norway. The fund is commonly referred to as the Oil Fund ().

The purpose of the fund is to invest parts of the large surplus generated by the Norwegian petroleum sector, mainly from taxes of companies but also payment for licenses to explore for oil as well as the State&#x27;s Direct Financial Interest and dividends from the partly state-owned Equinor. Current revenue from the petroleum sector is estimated to be at its peak period and to decline in the future decades. The Petroleum Fund was established in 1990 after a decision by the country&#x27;s legislature to counter the effects of the forthcoming decline in income and to smooth out the disruptive effects of highly fluctuating oil prices.

As its name suggests, the Government Pension Fund Global is invested in international financial markets, so the risk is independent from the Norwegian economy. The fund is invested in 8,763 companies in 71 countries (as of 2024). As of November 2024, the fund&#x27;s value was over 19 trillion Kroner, according to its official website.

===Background=== 
Norway has experienced economic surpluses since the development of its hydrocarbon resources in the 70s. This reality, coupled with the desire to mitigate volatility stemming from fluctuating oil prices, motivated the creation of Norway&#x27;s Oil Fund, now the Government Pension Fund-Global (GPF-G). The instability of oil prices has been of constant concern for oil-dependent countries since the start of the oil boom, but especially so in the decades following the first oil shocks in the 1970s. As the real GDP of oil-exporting states is linked with the price of oil, it has been a goal of these exporters to stabilize oil consumption patterns, and a host of these exporting states singled out sovereign wealth funds as an effective policy tool for achieving this outcome. The adoption of the GPF-G has been in line global economic trends, especially investment patterns. International investment has increased at a significantly higher pace than either global GDP or global trade of goods and services, increasing by 175% over a period at which the former two metrics increased by 53% and 93% respectively.

===Management and size===

The domestic fund, the Government Pension Fund Norway, is managed by Folketrygdfondet. The global investment fund is managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), part of the Norwegian Central Bank on the behalf of the Ministry of Finance.

 it was the largest pension fund in the world, but it is not a pension fund in the conventional sense, as it derives its financial backing from oil profits, not pension contributions. In September 2017, the fund exceeded US$1 trillion in value for the first time, a thirteen-fold increase since 2002. With a population of 5.2 million people, the fund was worth $192,307 per Norwegian citizen. Of the assets, 65% were equities (accounting for 1.3% of global equity markets), and the rest were property and fixed-income investments. Norway can withdraw up to 3% of the fund&#x27;s value each year. The first withdrawal in its history was made in 2016. In a parliamentary white paper in April 2011, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance forecast that the fund would reach $1 trillion by the end of 2019. According to the forecast, a worst-case scenario for the fund value in 2030 was forecast at $455 billion, and a best case scenario at $3.3 trillion. With 2.33 percent of European stocks, it is the largest stock owner in Europe.

In 1998, the fund was allowed to invest up to 40 percent of its portfolio in the international stock market. In June 2009, the ministry decided to raise the stock portion to 60 percent. In May 2014, the Central Bank governor proposed raising the rate to 70 percent. The Norwegian government planned that up to 5 percent of the fund should be invested in real estate, beginning in 2010. A specific policy for the real estate investments was suggested in a report the Swiss Partners Group wrote for the Norwegian Ministry of Finance.

Norway&#x27;s sovereign wealth fund is taking steps to become more active in company governance. In the second quarter of 2013, the sovereign fund voted in 6,078 general meetings as well as 239 shareholder proposals on environmental and social issues. Norway&#x27;s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) has the potential to influence the corporate governance market in Europe, and possibly China as well, greatly. It has also started to become active in pushing for lower executive pay.

==Relationship to sovereignty==
The rise of globalization as the predominant political-economic system has had several key effects on states, especially in regard to interdependence and sovereignty. The erosion of fully independent socioeconomic structures has provoked new questions regarding the role of the state and its ability to project its sovereignty on a set of global economic systems that seem largely out of reach both legally and pragmatically for most states. Sovereign wealth funds are an inherently nationalist type of investment vehicle, and there exists potential for their use as a mitigating force to the supranational forces of globalization. The issue with this is that such practices may lead to a general increase in protectionism as nations attempt to wrestle back control of their economies from external forces, an outcome that most economic intergovernmental organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund, would like to see avoided. Some commentators, like Professor Gordon L. Clark of the University of Oxford, express concerns regarding non-profit considerations motivating the practices of the GPF-G, especially in regards to its ethical concerns and how these considerations may be used as a means of exerting Norwegian standards on foreign firms. On the other hand, the OECD has stated that sovereign wealth funds have had a stabilizing influence on international markets due to their ability to provide capital during times of domestic investor pessimism. The OECD has taken steps to minimize the possibilities of economic protectionism by instituting the Freedom of Investment project, where participating states agree upon guiding sets of principles that seek to boost transparency and transnational investment, while also advising states on how to best handle issues of foreign investment in the sphere of national security.

===Debate===
As a result of the large size of the fund relative to the low number of people living in Norway (5.2 million people in 2017), the &quot;Oil Fund&quot; has become a hot political issue, dominated by three main issues:
* Whether the country should use more of the petroleum revenues for the state budget instead of saving the funds for the future. The main matter of debate is to what degree increased government spending would increase inflation.
* Whether the high level of exposure (around 65 percent in 2017) to the highly volatile stock market is financially safe. Others claim that the high diversification and extreme long-term nature of the investments will dilute the risk and that the state is losing considerable amounts of money because of the low investment percentage in the stock market.
* Whether the investment policy of the Petroleum Fund is ethical.

==Concerns and potential outcomes== 
There are diverse concerns and predicted effects of sovereign wealth funds on international financial markets and the global economy as a whole, with experts expressing strong fears regarding destabilization and protectionism stemming from sovereign wealth funds. The destabilization argument, often cited by Roland Beck of the European Central Bank, is that non-market investment motives may lead sovereign wealth funds managers to make decisions that go against market logic, in turn causing an unexpected and potentially disastrous ripple effect. The protectionist argument, mentioned above in relation to sovereignty and sovereign wealth funds, is essentially a fear that sovereign wealth funds could be used in a non-market, protectionist manner where competing states would perpetuate ever-increasing anti-global free trade movements. However, despite these fears, there is also strong evidence to suggest that sovereign wealth funds are unlikely to gain board of directors seats in their acquisitions. Additionally, Norway&#x27;s GPF-G is especially unlikely to gain any board-of-directors seats in a company headquartered in an OECD country. Furthermore, some experts directly contradict fears regarding the destabilizing effect of sovereign wealth funds, arguing that these funds increase the stability of global finance due to the fact that they serve to increase the variety of owners of risky financial vehicles, minimizing exposure to shocks in any one particular industry, while also simultaneously limiting the absolute loss any actor can suffer in a particular global economic sector.

===Ethical council===
Part of the investment policy debate is related to the discovery of several cases of investment by The Petroleum Fund in very controversial companies, involved in businesses such as arms production, tobacco and fossil fuels. The Petroleum Fund&#x27;s Advisory Council on Ethics was established 19 November 2004 by royal decree. Accordingly, the Ministry of Finance issued a new regulation on the management of the Government Petroleum Fund, which also includes ethical guidelines.

According to its ethical guidelines, the Norwegian pension fund cannot invest money in companies that directly or indirectly contribute to killing, torture, deprivation of freedom or other violations of human rights in conflict situations or wars. Contrary to popular belief, the fund is allowed to invest in a number of arms-producing companies, as only some kind of weapons, such as nuclear arms, are banned by the ethical guidelines as investment objects.

To support the ethical screening process, the Council on Ethics works with RepRisk ESG Business Intelligence, a global research firm and provider of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk data. RepRisk monitors the companies in the Norwegian Pension Fund&#x27;s portfolio for issues such as severe human rights violations, particularly regarding child labor, forced labour, and violations of individual rights in conflict areas as well as gross environmental degradation and corruption. RepRisk has been working with the Council on Ethics since 2009 and in 2014, re-won the tender for ESG data provision for 2014–2017.

An investigation by the Norwegian business newspaper in February 2012 showed that Norway has invested more than $2 billion in 15 technology companies producing technology that can and has been used for filtering, wiretapping, or surveillance of communication in various countries, among them Iran, Syria, and Burma. Although surveillance tech is not the primary activity of all the 15 companies, they have all had or still have some kind of connection to such technology. The Ministry of Finance in Norway stated that it would not withdraw investing in these companies or discuss an eventual exclusion of surveillance industry companies from its investments.

On 19 January 2010 the Ministry of Finance announced that 17 tobacco companies had been excluded from the fund. The total divestment from these companies was $2 billion (NOK 14.2 billion), making it the largest divestment caused by ethical recommendations in the history of the fund.

In March 2014, as the result of both domestic and international pressure, the parliament appointed a panel to investigate whether the fund should divest its coal assets in line with its ethical investment mandate. The panel released its recommendations in December 2014, recommending the fund follow a strategy of corporate engagement rather than divestment. The parliament was set to make its decision early in 2015. In the event, the fund will be required to divest from companies that derive at least 30% of their business from coal.

In 2014, the fund divested from 53 coal companies around the world, including 16 companies in the US (among them Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, and Alpha Natural Resources), 13 companies in India (including Coal India) and 3 companies in China. As a result, the total value of the fund&#x27;s coal holdings fell by 5% to $9.7 billion. In 2014, the fund also sold its stakes in 59 out of 90 oil and gas companies in which it holds shares by $30 billion. In May 2015, Norwegian political members agreed on the divestment of $945 million of the fund from coal assets. By June 2015, a total of $900 billion in coal assets were agreed to be sold, the largest in the 122 affected companies was UK’s SSE, where the fund held $956 million in shares.

On 8 March 2019, the Ministry of Finance recommended divestiture from its oil and gas exploration and production holdings. This came after the August 2017 Lofoten Declaration which demanded leadership in a global fossil fuel phase-out from the countries that can most afford to act, such as Norway.

Green energy is becoming an important aspect for the Government Pension Fund since fossil fuel stocks simply are not producing as much value as they used to. As of 2019, new guidelines will prohibit the fund from investing in companies that produce over 20 million tons of coal annually. The fund plans to sell off over $10 billion in stocks from companies using too many fossil fuels. In hopes of improving the Norwegian economy, the firm is becoming more environmentally-friendly by investing in companies that promote renewable energy. For example, the fund will continue to hold stakes in firms like Shell using renewable energy divisions.

In March 2021, it was reported that the Government Pension Fund was examining whether companies in the fund had used forced labor from Xinjiang internment camps.

On 1 December 2021, the fund&#x27;s head of Governance and Compliance, Carine Smith Ihenacho, told Reuters that companies in its portfolio will be asked to take more specific action on climate change.

===Excluded companies===
The following companies have been excluded from the Government Pension Fund of Norway for activities in breach of the ethical guidelines:
The fund does not announce exclusions until it has completed sales of its positions, so as not to affect the share price at the time of the transaction.

In 2016, Norges Bank decided to exclude 52 coal companies from the fund.

===Reinstated companies===
Several previously excluded companies have later been reinstated to the fund because the companies were no longer involved in the activities that had led to their exclusion.

===Companies &quot;under observation&quot;===
As an alternative to full exclusion from the fund, companies may be placed &quot;under observation&quot; to help put pressure on the company to improve.

It was proposed that one more company, Goldcorp, should be placed under similar observation. Goldcorp, as of 2019, merged with another company and no longer exists.

===Currency portfolio===
In October 2010 the fund spent NOK 600 million ($136.4 million as of October 2010) daily buying foreign currencies. That figure would be increased to 800 million kroner daily in November. This practice was suspended in January 2011, and on 31 January it was announced that this would also be the case in February.

==Government Pension Fund – Norway==
The Government Pension Fund – Norway (, SPN) was established by the &quot;National Insurance Act&quot; () in 1967 under the name &quot;National Insurance Scheme Fund&quot; (). The name was changed at the same time as the former Petroleum Fund, on 1 January 2006. It continues to be managed by a separate board and separate government entity, still named . The Government Pension Fund – Norway had a value of NOK 384 billion autumn 2024. Unlike the Global division, it is required to limit its investments to companies in the Norwegian stock market, predominantly on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The Fund is not allowed to own more than a 15% interest in any single Norwegian company.

<text>Sex is a 1992 coffee table book written by American singer Madonna, with photography by Steven Meisel Studio and Fabien Baron. It was edited by Glenn O&#x27;Brien and published by Warner Books, Maverick and Callaway. The book features adult content including softcore pornography and simulations of sexual acts including sadomasochism.

Madonna developed &quot;Sex&quot; after Judith Regan of Simon &amp; Schuster publishers suggested a book of erotic photographs. She wrote it as a character named &quot;Mistress Dita&quot;, inspired by 1930s film actress Dita Parlo. It was influenced by punk rock and fashion figures including Guy Bourdin, Helmut Newton and Robert Mapplethorpe. The photos were shot in early 1992 in New York City and Miami, in locations including hotels, burlesque theaters, and city streets. The book includes cameos by actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, and socialite Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg. The cover is made of aluminium, spiral bound and wrapped in a Mylar sheet.

Madonna&#x27;s publishers were apprehensive about the release and the book&#x27;s commercial potential. It was released on October 21, 1992, the day after Madonna&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Erotica&quot;. A CD single was also packaged with the book which contained the song &quot;Erotic&quot;, a song similar in composition to her similarly named single &quot;Erotica&quot;. It sold over 150,000 copies on its first day in the United States, and topped the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for three weeks. In a matter of days, &quot;Sex&quot; went on to sell more than 1.5 million copies worldwide and remains the best and fastest-selling coffee table book. It also remains as one of the most in-demand out-of-print publications of all time.

&quot;Sex&quot; attracted extensive media attention and backlash, but Madonna remained unapologetic. Though it initially received negative reviews from fans and critics, who felt she had &quot;gone too far&quot;, later reviews have been more positive, with academics deeming it a defining phase in Madonna&#x27;s career. &quot;Sex&quot; is noted for its social and cultural impact and is considered a bold post-feminist work.

== Background and development ==
According to Giselle Benatar of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, two versions explain how Madonna came up with the idea for the book. One is that she conceived the idea of an erotic photography book during the shooting of the film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; in the summer of 1991. The other is that Judith Regan, vice-president and editor-in-chief of Simon &amp; Schuster, armed with a proposal for a collection of photo-erotica, flew to Los Angeles in March 1991 to meet with Madonna and her manager Freddy DeMann. She verified Regan had not approached other celebrities with the concept as she was only interested in the project if it was a unique idea. By the end of the meeting Madonna had agreed &quot;in principle&quot; to do a book titled &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Book of Erotica and Sexual Fantasies&quot;. She told Regan that DeMann would call her and work out the book&#x27;s details. However, Madonna never got back to Regan who assumed she did not want to go ahead with the idea. Madonna&#x27;s publicist Liz Rosenberg has never confirmed nor denied Regan&#x27;s claim they had an agreement.
According to Benatar, Madonna began working on &quot;Sex&quot; before wrapping up shooting &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;. At first, Warner Bros. Records and the executive directors of Time Warner were reluctant to allow Madonna to publish such a book, but finally agreed. Madonna had to sign a contract that forbade the book from including images of child pornography, bestiality, or religious imagery. Not long after signing the agreement, Madonna founded Maverick, a multi-media entertainment company in partnership with Time Warner. Since by contract she had total artistic control over any work released by Maverick, who were now the book&#x27;s publisher, the agreement she signed with Time Warner over the content in &quot;Sex&quot; was null and void.

&quot;Sex&quot;″s stylized, sado-masochistic look had a range of influences from punk rock, to early fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton. Photographs from Brassaï&#x27;s 1933 book &quot;Paris de nuit&quot; (&quot;Paris by Night&quot;) also inspired several of the book&#x27;s series of images. The book was also influenced by Robert Mapplethorpe&#x27;s infamous three-part &quot;XYZ&quot; portfolio, particularly the &quot;X&quot; portfolio. Madonna had considered using &quot;X&quot; as a title during the formative stages of &quot;Sex&quot;, but she changed her mind when promotion for Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Malcolm X&quot; began. (It was released three weeks after the book). She would go on to tell &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine: &quot;We were gonna call it &quot;X&quot; [...] but then the whole thing with the Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, &#x27;Fuck it, it&#x27;s a really good symbol and I thought of it first&#x27;. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [Lee]. Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it&#x27;s universal, it doesn&#x27;t need translation – and it&#x27;s only two letters more than X.&quot;

Madonna hired top-notch talent for the book&#x27;s development, and counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. She hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O&#x27;Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be an oval shape to simulate a condom, but its printing and manufacturing would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: &quot;Madonna and I can keep up with each other&quot;, noting &quot;I&#x27;m doing things to make people think too. It&#x27;s not really to antagonize or to push people&#x27;s buttons. It&#x27;s really to present another way of seeing things.&quot;

During the photo sessions for &quot;Sex&quot;, photographer Steven Meisel was accompanied by art director Fabion Baron who filmed the shoots on Super 8 film for use in the music video for the song &quot;Erotica&quot;. The photo sessions took place in New York City and Miami. Locations in New York City included the Hotel Chelsea and Times Square&#x27;s all-male burlesque Gaiety Theatre whose dancers participated in one of the book&#x27;s photo sessions along with porn star Joey Stefano and actor Udo Kier. Many of the Miami photo sessions took place at Madonna&#x27;s Coconut Grove mansion that she had recently purchased before beginning the &quot;Sex&quot; book project, while other sessions were done on several beaches and streets close to her home. One morning during the four-day Florida shoot Madonna was prancing naked around her 14-bedroom house in Miami when someone jokingly suggested she go out on the street, which she did on two occasions – topless with Vanilla Ice and completely nude while pretending to hitchhike. According to Baron on the street &quot;cars screeched to a halt, motorists whistled, and one entranced cyclist fell off his bike&quot;. During the photo shoots Baron said, &quot;[Madonna]&#x27;d do something crazy and then we&#x27;d come up with something even crazier&quot;. One of the most shocking photographs features two women in post-punk attire flanking Madonna with one of them holding a knife to her crotch. It was considered too violent to be used. While the book was being produced some of the photographs were stolen but were quickly recovered by the FBI. According to &quot;New York&quot; magazine, there were approximately 80,000 photographs taken for the book; only a handful of them were used. It took 15 days to print the book. The total production process took about eight months. Warner Bros. commented that &quot;Sex&quot; was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many printing companies. They noted that to make a profit the book needed to sell at least 350,000 copies.

== Design and content ==
Wrapped and sealed in a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) Mylar bag, &quot;Sex&quot; has 128 pages and is spiral bound with an aluminium cover that has the word &quot;Sex&quot; stamped in the middle and a warning label. The front page shows Madonna against a sky blue backdrop. Three different types of paper were used for the printing. Madonna and Baron &amp; Baron Inc. (consisting of Fabien Baron and the photographer Siung Fat Tjia), who also collaborated with her designing the cover art for her fifth studio album, &quot;Erotica&quot;, oversaw the design. As this was Maverick&#x27;s first project, the packaging was crucial. Madonna had no faith in Warner Book&#x27;s &quot;mass-market&quot; publication process, however, so Baron suggested they transfer the packaging job to Nicholas Callaway&#x27;s bespoke Callaway Editions. Charles Melcher, the book&#x27;s co-publisher with Callaway, said they usually published &quot;exquisite art books, $100 high end, beautiful things&quot;. It was a challenge for them to process Madonna&#x27;s ideas into reality. The artist wanted the packaging to be sealed, so the reader had to tear it open to read the book. They considered various kinds of clasps before deciding on a sealed bag as a reference to a condom package. The metal cover was Madonna&#x27;s idea. She was inspired by the 1979 album &quot;Metal Box&quot; by Public Image Ltd. Melcher recalls, &quot;We were talking about materials for the cover, and we went into her kitchen. [Madonna] pointed at the metal plate at the back of her stove and said, &#x27;I want something like this&#x27;. I was very impressed with the way she interacted with her world to source things&quot;. The company bought about of aluminium, roughly a pound for each book. The designers oversaw the production of the front and back covers, which were stamped and anodized while the aluminium was rolling on a press.

The book opens with the introduction: &quot;Everything you are about to see and read is a fantasy, a dream, pretend.&quot; Throughout &quot;Sex&quot;, Madonna offers poems, stories, and essays. She used the pseudonym &quot;Mistress Dita&quot; as an homage to German actress Dita Parlo; her friends in the stories are Bunny, Dex, Stella, Chiclet and Stranger. According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, a big part of the book reads like a letter to a pornographic magazine. Madonna wanted to explore the notion of power in &quot;Sex&quot;. Melcher said she wanted to talk about &quot;gentle and hard, soft and violent [in &quot;Sex&quot;]. She was playing out all those elements in her book. That was reflected in the materials: uncoated, soft paper on the inside and hard metal coating on the outside&quot;.

Like the text—which was mostly printed on the photographs—they are highly sexual and depict nudity, simulations of sexual acts, bondage, homosexuality and analingus, with accessories such as knives, whips, masks and chains; however, intercourse is never shown. Actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna&#x27;s then-boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Princess Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares and unknown models are featured in the book. Its heterosexual photos involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book&#x27;s most famous photographs shows a naked Madonna hitchhiking in Miami. The book also reflects Dita&#x27;s perspective towards her own sexuality. She writes that her &quot;pussy&quot; is a temple of learning and exposing it, is really an homage to it. &quot;It&#x27;s hard to describe it smells like a baby to me fresh and full of life. I love my pussy, it is the complete summation of my life.&quot; &quot;Sex&quot; contains statements like &quot;ass fucking is the most pleasurable way to get fucked and it hurts the most too&quot;. &quot;There is something comforting about being tied up. Like when you were a baby and your mother strapped you in the car seat. She wanted you to be safe. It was an act of love&quot;. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want a penis. It would be like having a third leg. it seems like a contraption that would get in the way. I think I have a dick in my brain&quot;. Dita also points out &quot;A lot of people are afraid to say what they want. That&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t get what they want&quot;. Since they recovered stolen pictures during the making of &quot;Sex&quot;, Madonna thanked the FBI for &quot;rescuing photographs that would have made J. Edgar Hoover roll over&quot; in the book&#x27;s credits.

== Publication and promotion ==
The book&#x27;s imminent release caused a great deal of controversy. One photo showed a nude Madonna wearing a rabbit&#x27;s tail, shaving the pubic hair of a naked man, and cavorting outdoors with a dog, suggesting bestiality. The Vatican urged its followers to boycott the book, saying that it was &quot;morally intolerable&quot;. Indian customs officials said the book offended the country&#x27;s public morality. The Press Trust of India (PTI), India&#x27;s domestic news agency, quoted a top customs official as saying the book would be seized under a section of the Customs Act prohibiting entry of indecent literature. Citizens of Alexandria, Louisiana, filed a complaint with the city&#x27;s police department on behalf of the Rapides Parish Chapter of the American Family Association, claiming &quot;Sex&quot; violated Louisiana&#x27;s anti-obscenity laws. U.S. Southern Baptists did not want their Bibles printed on the same printing presses as &quot;Sex&quot; and threatened to stop doing business with the printer RR Donnelley. The Nashville-based Baptist Sunday School Board, a division of the Southern Baptist Convention, reviewed their $2.1 million ($ in dollars) printing contract with Donnelley. Board President James Draper said he was infuriated Donnelley printed &quot;such an obscene book&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; reported Madonna had initiated the mayhem with the explicit content in the music video for &quot;Erotica&quot;, walking bare breasted at designer Jean Paul Gaultier&#x27;s fashion show and posing nude in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine. A writer for &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; said that since the press wanted &quot;controversy&quot;, Madonna was willing to give them &quot;fodder&quot; with her &quot;antiques&quot;.
Madonna claimed she was publishing &quot;Sex&quot; &quot;to liberate America — free us all of our hang-ups&quot;. She told &quot;Spin:&quot; &quot;We live in a very repressed society, and I deal with erotic themes. The point I try to make is: Why should we feel ashamed of our sexuality?&quot;. She stated later that the book &quot;does not condone unsafe sexual practices&quot;. Nicholas Callaway of Callaway Arts &amp; Entertainment said the book was &quot;inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy. It&#x27;s hard to calculate the effect, [but], &quot;Sex&quot; should be considered &#x27;art&#x27;&quot;. It was rumored that Time Warner was nervous about the book&#x27;s release, however, in an interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt Madonna &quot;should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it&quot;. The Warner company said they would make sure &quot;Sex&quot; reached its target audience. They reminded the public the book was safely wrapped in a Mylar bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label.

Michael Kilian of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published a tongue-in-cheek article on October 7, 1992, about the coming release: &quot;Prepare thyself, [...], The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It&#x27;s an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of Leanza Cornett as the new Miss America.&quot; Kilian went on to write: &quot;The word on the street (which is precisely where it belongs) is that this is the hottest Truly Twisted personal sexual fantasy picture book in all Christendom, that it goes far beyond all previous Truly Twisted personal sexual fantasy picture books-perhaps beyond all imagining what such a book could be.

On October 15, Madonna threw a pre-release party at New York City&#x27;s Industria Superstudio having signed all the invitations with &quot;Dita&quot; her &quot;Sex&quot; alter ego. She dressed as Little Bo Peep carrying a stuffed toy lamb. Madonna&#x27;s publicist Liz Rosenberg expressed concern at first about &quot;what the parents of America&#x27;s impressionable teens will soon be thinking&quot; of Madonna, but said that it &quot;all depends on your idea of lovemaking, which in Madonna&#x27;s case, should give new meaning to the word erotic&quot;. Waldenbooks and Barnes &amp; Noble prepared corporate statements store managers could share with customers who were offended by &quot;Sex&quot;. (Both statements defended the right of bookstores to provide &quot;diversity and choice&quot; to customers, saying censorship is not the role of bookstores.) Many book stores stated the book would not be sold to anyone under 18 and it would only be on display behind the cash register. Bookstore owner David Epstein said, &quot;The feeling of most people who have ordered the book is that Madonna is something special, that this is cutting-edge art [...] they&#x27;re not the kind of people who are buying it because it&#x27;s smut and dirty pictures. People are interested in it as art.&quot;

&quot;Sex&quot; was released on October 21, 1992, the day after Madonna&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Erotica&quot;. A comic book title &quot;Dita in The Chelsea Girl&quot; and a promotional single titled &quot;Erotic&quot;, wrapped in packaging representing a condom wrapper, was included with the book. &quot;Erotic&quot;, a stripped-down arrangement of the song &quot;Erotica&quot;, offered an alternate vocal take not used on the album version. Upon its release, the book was banned in India, Ireland, Japan and some Australian states.

Given the controversy surrounding the book there was no need for Madonna to promote it. One of the few promotions she did, however, was to appear on the cover of the October edition of &quot;Vogue&quot;, dressed in &quot;Hippie trip&quot; fashion. These photographs were taken by Meisel. On October 22, 1992, MTV aired a special called &quot;The Day in Madonna&quot;, hosted by Kurt Loder (a pun on the title of their daily show &quot;The Day in Rock&quot;). It profiled the release of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Sex&quot; and her album &quot;Erotica&quot;, even taking the book to the streets to allow people, including a sex therapist and a group of real-life New York City dominatrices, to view it. MTV also interviewed people who had looked at the book on the day of its release at the HMV music store in New York City. To celebrate its release, the store held a Madonna look-alike contest and set up a booth where people could view the book for one dollar a minute, with the proceeds going to Lifebeat, the music industry organization founded to help fund AIDS research.

== Critical response ==

Critics, conservative, feminist and anti-porn groups reacted negatively to the book because of its sexually explicit photographs, which many characterized as hardcore pornography. J. Randy Taraborrelli, in his biography of Madonna, wrote that much of the book appears surprising, not shocking. He derided the concept as childish and impetuous. Though Madonna insisted she was trying to demystify sexuality altogether, he believed she just wanted to publish pornographic text and pictures and get away with it: &quot;She was being a brat, not a revolutionary.&quot; Author Lucy O&#x27;Brien declared the book a bold, harrowing exercise in frustration, and despite Madonna&#x27;s attempt at invincibility, it appeared to be &quot;a curious act of self-destruction&quot;. Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said &quot;The overwhelming effect of the book is numbing&quot;. Describing the photographs as &quot;derivative&quot;, he wrote that &quot;Madonna herself seems far too eager to shock; that, not even prurient arousal, seems the ideal response the book tirelessly seeks. The potency of &quot;Sex&quot;″s subject matter is dissipated by Madonna and Meisel&#x27;s self-congratulatory – and silly – sense of their own &#x27;bravery,&#x27; as if their naughty games were somehow revolutionary.&quot;

Roger Catlin of the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; said some passages from the book were &quot;too dirty to quote ... even the funny ones&quot;. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; said &quot;the book is neither groundbreaking (save that it features a major star) nor particularly sexy [...] &quot;Sex&quot; is convincing only when it&#x27;s playful, as when she appears nude in a Miami pizzeria, chewing a slice while a baffled customer looks on. Elsewhere, she&#x27;s simply undressed with no place to go.&quot; Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in a mixed review, wrote: &quot;Is &quot;Sex&quot; shocking? Not really. Mostly because it&#x27;s Madonna, and somehow we&#x27;ve come to expect this from her. Is &quot;Sex&quot; boring? Surprisingly, yes.&quot; British author Zoë Heller of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that it was &quot;the women who once saw Madonna as a witty feminist role model who have been most alarmist about her latest pornographic incarnation ... Previously, they say, Madonna played with traditional images of feminine sexuality in a subversive, &#x27;empowering&#x27; way. But now, with sado-masochism and rape fantasies, she has gone too far.&quot;

Calvin Tomkins, author and art critic for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, wrote that &quot;unfortunately, the book is going to be mistaken for pornography&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; deemed it &quot;the dirtiest coffee table book to ever be published&quot;. Caryn James, in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; wrote: &quot;There is plenty here to offend the meek (whips and chains), the self-righteous (gay men and lesbians), not to mention the tasteful (a tacky and cluttered art design)&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot;″ Vicki Goldberg was dismissive, writing, &quot;Unfortunately, not many of the images are very good photographically. Many are just pictures, or just porn.&quot; Writing for &quot;Spin&quot;, Bob Guccione, Jr. gave the book a particularly unfavorable review:

With &quot;Sex&quot;, Madonna broke several worldwide records. The retail price of the book was $50 in the United States, or around $ in dollars. Across Europe, &quot;Sex&quot; was sold for £25 in the United Kingdom, and for pta 7500 in Spain (an equivalent of $70 at the time or $ in ). The most expensive sales were found in Argentina with a retail price of $89, which is about $ in dollars.

The initial print run for the first edition was one million copies in five continents and in five languages. It set the record for the largest first printing of an illustrated book in publishing history. Callaway pointed out the book was an &quot;unprecedented hit&quot;, because the print run of an average art book ranges between 5,000 and 10,000 units. Hundreds of copies of the book were pre-ordered, prompting book sellers to say that &quot;Sex&quot; was &quot;shattering their sales records for advance purchases&quot;. John Robinson from &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; informed that many booksellers agreed that &quot;&quot;Sex&quot; sold, like nothing else before&quot; and &quot;they&#x27;ve never seen anything like it, especially for a $50 book&quot;. In Canada, H.B. Fenn and Company, distributors of &quot;Sex&quot;, reported an order for more than 45,000 copies from bookstores across the country by October 22.

===Release===
In the United States, &quot;Sex&quot; sold 150,000 copies on its release day, with additional 500,000 units a week later. The book also reached the number one on both &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, topping the latter for three weeks. By the end of the year, &quot;Sex&quot; ended among the Top 15 of the best-selling titles in the United States with sales of over 750,000 units. The book became a &quot;huge bestseller&quot; in Canada after a &quot;careful review&quot; by customs authorities according to &quot;Quill &amp; Quire&quot;. It sold out 45,000 copies across the country, becoming one of the fastest-selling books in Canadian history. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Sex&quot; sold 100,000 copies in its first day, including 80,000 units in the first half an hour in London according to &quot;Creative Camera&quot;. &quot;Sex&quot; ended as the second best-selling hardcover book of 1992 in the UK, behind Andrew Morton&#x27;s Diana biography.

In France, Madonna held the record for the highest first-month sales for a book in history, before being surpassed by Thierry Meyssan with &quot;L&#x27;Effroyable Impasture&quot; in 2002. In Paris alone, 23,000 copies were sold in the first hour of release. &quot;Sex&quot; sold 7,220 units in Spain within its first two days, and 2,000 copies in the first five-hours in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. In Italy, the book moved 5,000 copies. By October 24, a spokeswoman for Australian distributors, Octopus Publishing, informed thousands of copies of &quot;Sex&quot; had been sold in Western Australia. Despite the censorship, &quot;Sex&quot; was able to sell 150,000 units of an edited version of the initial printing in Japan, topping the national best-selling list upon its release. According to the Chinese state newspaper, the book sold 5,000 copies in the first-week in the city of Shanghai alone. Although the book was censored shortly after its publication, several hundred of copies were sold in the Irish capital. 

Worldwide, the book sold 700,000 units in its first day. In summary, &quot;Sex&quot; went on to sell 1.5 million copies worldwide in a matter of days, becoming the fastest-selling coffee table book in history. It remains the best-selling coffee table book of all time. In 1999, Ed Brown from &quot;Fortune&quot; called &quot;Sex&quot; the best-selling illustrated book in history, further comparing that &quot;for most publishers, selling 20,000 copies of a coffee-table book is a minor miracle&quot;.

===Reactions===
By December 1992, Paul Craig from McClatchy called it the biggest wonder of the year in literature. Giselle Benatar described &quot;Sex&quot; as &quot;the publishing event of the century&quot;. A day prior its release, Tyra Braden of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; concluded that the book &quot;might become a collector&#x27;s item a few years down the road&quot;. Writing for &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 1999, Joel Selvin noted the prices for the book on the web, ranging from $200 to $500 for sealed copies; ten times the original $50 cover price. According to Barry Walters from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2019, &quot;Sex&quot; remains one of the most in-demand out-of-print publications of all time. A long-lasting title at BookFinder.com&#x27;s lists, &quot;Sex&quot; featured as the most requested out-of-print publication from 2011 to 2015. In their database, AbeBooks recalls: &quot;The most famous out-of-print book of modern times is Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Sex&quot; book, which remains in demand but the pop star refuses to republish it&quot;.

== Social impact and aftermath ==

The book, though widely panned by the press, is regarded as one of the factors that shaped the social reaction and criticism of Madonna during the early 1990s. Her fifth studio album &quot;Erotica&quot; was affected by the negative press surrounding the book. In March 1993, &quot;Spin&quot; wrote an article praising the book. Months later in Mexico, social communicologist Nino Canún dedicated an episode of his morning talk show &quot;¿Y usted qué opina?&quot; (English: &quot;So what&#x27;s your opinion?&quot;), to Madonna. Some members of the audience, among them a priest, presented their arguments why The Girlie Show concert tour by &quot;this morally clueless singer&quot; should not be allowed in Mexico. Later, during the Mexican concert, in response to these comments, Madonna wore a &quot;charro&quot; sombrero and simulated an orgy with her dancers onstage.

Continuing her provocative work, Madonna starred in the erotic thriller &quot;Body of Evidence&quot;, which features her fully nude engaging in simulated sexual acts. In March 1994, she was a guest on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, used profanity, and handed Letterman a pair of her underwear asking him to smell it. The release of her sexually explicit works, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman led some critics to see Madonna as a sexual renegade. She also faced a strong negative reaction from critics and fans who commented that &quot;she had gone too far&quot; and that her career was over. Author Lucy O&#x27;Brien commented:


Madonna responded to the huge backlash with the song &quot;Human Nature&quot;, from her next album &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; (1994), with the lyrics &quot;Did I say something wrong? Oops, I didn&#x27;t know I couldn&#x27;t talk about sex,&quot; while declaring &quot;And I&#x27;m not sorry. It&#x27;s human nature.&quot;
She later explained: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say I regret it. I&#x27;ve made mistakes and learned from them. Most people want to hear me say that I regret publishing my &quot;Sex&quot; book. I don&#x27;t. The problem was releasing my &quot;Erotica&quot; album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked.&quot; In 2003, Madonna said: &quot;I&#x27;m not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the &quot;Sex&quot; book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it.&quot;

In 2002, Naomi Campbell said she had &quot;a lot of respect for Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I&#x27;ve never reneged on that.&quot; In 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice confessed to being unhappy with the book once he saw it. &quot;My friends were like, &#x27;Dude, that&#x27;s cool man&#x27;, but I was like, &#x27;I&#x27;m dating her, it&#x27;s not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people&#x27; [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids&#x27; books now but they&#x27;re going to see it and go, &#x27;Mommy, what were you thinking?&#x27;&quot; Another of the book&#x27;s models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told &quot;Out&quot; that she regretted her participation: &quot;I don&#x27;t think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of &#x27;I&#x27;ll teach you how to be free!&#x27; – and that bothered the hell out of me.&quot;

Later reviews of &quot;Sex&quot; have been more positive. The authors of &quot;The Porning of America: The Rise of Porn Culture, What It Means, and Where We Go from Here&quot; (2008) commented that &quot;the book is particularly interesting in the way that, like many of Madonna&#x27;s works, it portrays sex in terms of domination and power&quot;. Jane Raphaely, editor-in-chief of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; (South Africa) praised Madonna&#x27;s &quot;liberated behavior in &quot;Sex&quot; [...] the fact that she takes all forms of pornography and systematically demystifies it by putting it under her control&quot;, in an article in 1996. Brian McNair, author of &quot;Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratisation of Desire&quot; (2002) praised this period of Madonna&#x27;s career, saying she had &quot;porno elegance&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Sex&quot; is a cultural phenomenon of global proportions&quot; which &quot;established her iconic status and cultural influence&quot;. Priya Elan of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, wrote: &quot;That the &quot;Sex&quot; book came after a record-breaking album and tour felt like a shrink-wrapped curve ball. But Madge was expressing something unique.&quot; Elan felt the book was part of a &quot;slower reveal that began with confessional tracks such as &#x27;Oh Father&#x27; (from 1989&#x27;s &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;) and continued with the many scenes of narcissism captured in &quot;&quot;&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Several writers consider &quot;Sex&quot; a bold, post-feminist work of art besides being labeled a &quot;cultural book&quot;. Martin Amis of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote an essay discussing the book&#x27;s cultural meaning. Critical theorist Douglas Kellner affirmed that with &quot;Sex&quot; &quot;Madonna became herself, an artifact of pop culture&quot;. French academic writer Georges-Claude Guilbert described &quot;Sex&quot; as &quot;one of the most successful publicity stunts in history&quot;, whereas Russell W. Belk, author of &quot;Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing&quot;, feels its success was a product of marketing. Despite the negative feedback, sales of &quot;Sex&quot; generated more than US$20 million ($ million in dollars) for Madonna in 1992 from its first print-run. It was deemed as an &quot;unprecedented entrepreneurial coup&quot;. Overall, &quot;Sex&quot; generated US$70 million in sales at retail.

Taraborrelli commented in his book, &quot;&quot;, that Madonna&#x27;s friends knew the book and her behavior were a barrier to shield her from the world. She was tired of the extreme scrutiny from the public and media which she had provoked. Annoyed, Madonna fought back by creating the persona of a renegade, someone so outrageous as to defy explanation, someone found objectionable by most people. Taraborrelli said that in Madonna&#x27;s view, &quot;she had no other way of fighting back&quot;.

According to some writers, &quot;Sex&quot; also helped Madonna make a name in the porn industry, and earned her the title of S&amp;M&#x27;s first cultural ambassador earning her praise for recreating &quot;porn-chic&quot;. Humberto Quiroga Lavié pointed out because &quot;Sex&quot; was considered pornographic that helped it to become a bestseller. Steve Bachmann, in his book &quot;Simulating Sex: Aesthetic Representations of Erotic Activity&quot; pointed out that &quot;perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Madonna&#x27;s sexual phenomenon is the extent to which her book marked a new threshold in the pornographic franchise&quot;. McNair wrote in his book that, &quot;&quot;Sex&quot; brought out the personal underground to the surface of pop culture&quot;. London art critic Sarah Kent wrote in &quot;Time Out&quot; that the timing of &quot;Sex&quot; was &quot;impeccable. Obsession about the human body was in vogue. Along with Madonna&#x27;s book were artist Andres Serrano&#x27;s &quot;cumming shots&quot; and Jeff Koons&#x27; &quot;The Jeff Koons Handbook&quot; portraying fairy tale pictures of the artist having sex with his pornographic actor wife, Cicciolina.

&quot;Sex&quot; has also become an important book in the LGBT community. Mark Blankenship, of the LGBT-oriented website New Now Next said that &quot;literature changed forever&quot; with the publishing of &quot;Sex&quot;. Madonna&#x27;s portrayal of lesbian love scenes in the book sparked debates about her own sexual orientation. This was an adjunct to her public relationship with comedian Sandra Bernhard with whom she visited lesbian nightclubs and partied. The LGBT community felt it was an important portrayal for them. They debated whether Madonna was &quot;ripping&quot; them off for publicity. Carolin Grace of &quot;Diva&quot; said: &quot;Madonna became meaningful in the early nineties, when &quot;Sex&quot; came out, and at that point lesbian culture was really changing.&quot; She felt women were coming out about their sexuality and the book&#x27;s handling of the taboo issue was &quot;a legacy, our contribution to the show&quot;, stressing &quot;[t]he lesbian sub-cultural references borrowed by Madonna aren&#x27;t our only possessions.&quot; O&#x27;Brien argues in her book &quot;&quot;, the book had a confusing philosophy. According to female critics, who pointed out the vacuousness of Madonna&#x27;s remarks about porn and abuse, she did not understand that behind the fantasies the &quot;reality is too hard&quot; for a woman to endure, referring to the daily hustles that women have to face in red light districts and brothels. The author felt that despite the courageous premise of genuine exploration of queer sex, the book crossed over into pornography and was a wrong portrayal for the community, while being flippant and commercial. She used the example of the death of pornographic actor Joey Stefano, one of the models in the book, from a drug overdose. Stefano had been thrilled to be a part of the book but was underpaid. Once Madonna and her team were done with the shoot, &quot;they packed up and left the Gaiety... They left behind the mundane reality and the boys who have to deal with it seven days a week&quot;.

In 2017, Matthew Jacobs from the &quot;HuffPost&quot; wrote that it was &quot;an audacious thesis statement, calculated enough to piss people off but seemly enough to maintain artistic integrity. No one today would dare emulate it&quot;, calling it &quot;the most radical career move a pop star has ever made&quot;.

===30th anniversary Art Basel exhibition and Christie&#x27;s auction===
From November 29 to December 4, 2022, Madonna partnered with Yves Saint Laurent for an art pop-up exhibition titled &quot;Sex by Madonna&quot;, at Art Basel in Miami Beach. Curated by Madonna and Anthony Vaccarello, large format prints from the book were shown in a temporarily constructed art gallery on the beach. 800 copies of the &quot;Sex&quot; book were re-issued, with a handful personally signed by Madonna. The price ranged from $1500–3000 and the signed copies were held up for auction, to raise proceeds for Raising Malawi. Various celebrities attended the event.

On May 10, 2023, Christie&#x27;s announced a collaborative auction on October 6, 2023, with Madonna and Steven Meisel titled &quot;Madonna x Meisel – the SEX photographs&quot;. The auction will feature over 40 photographs that will go on sale, with proceeds going to Madonna&#x27;s charity Raising Malawi. Darius Himes, Christie&#x27;s Deputy Chairman describes the photos as sitting &quot;at a moment in art history of the late 20th century that both summarizes a moment, playful and prescient, and hints at the future of public stardom driven by image-conscious figures. These images are nothing short of brilliant&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

&quot;Sex&quot; has also become an object of modern culture references. American performance artist Ann Magnuson, who worked with Madonna on the 1985 film &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;, released a parody of the book&#x27;s photo sessions, where she simulated sex with a giant stuffed bear. In 2010, writer-performer Greg Scarnici released a book titled &quot;Sex in Drag&quot;, which featured over 70 images parodying photos in &quot;Sex&quot;. In a deleted scene from a 1993 episode (&quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;) of the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, aired as part of &quot;The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular&quot;, Krusty the Clown attempts to market a book like &quot;Sex&quot; to resolve his financial woes. He is seen in a suggestive pose on the front cover. Unlike Madonna, however, Krusty apparently never appeared fully nude, as he quickly claimed that he used a body double.

In 2008, &quot;People&quot; magazine ranked Madonna&#x27;s look and attire at the &quot;Sex&quot; pre-release party as one of her 50 Looks We Can&#x27;t Forget. In April 2012, a nude picture of Madonna taken by Meisel was put up for sale. An outtake from the book, it features a naked Madonna sporting bleach-blonde hair and dark eye make-up; lying on a bed and partially covered by a sheet, she is smoking a cigarette. An unnamed collector purchased it for almost US$24,000 ($ in dollars). In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the book on its list of 20 Great Moments in Rock Star Nudity. Author Keith Harris wrote that &quot;no celebrity had ever commanded control over her own naked image so audaciously&quot;.

<text>Comerica Incorporated is an American financial services company, headquartered in Dallas, Texas. It is the parent of Comerica Bank, a regional commercial bank with 413 branches in the U.S. states of Texas, Michigan, California, Florida and Arizona. Comerica is among the largest U.S. financial holding companies, with offices in a number of U.S. cities.

==History==

=== 1800s ===
At the start of 1849, there were just three banks in Detroit: Farmers &amp; Mechanics’ Bank, Michigan Insurance Company Bank and the State Bank of Michigan. These three banks were commercial banks that served the business community. On August 17, 1849, Comerica was founded in Detroit by Elon Farnsworth, a lawyer and politician, as the Detroit Savings Fund Institute. Michigan Governor Epaphroditus Ransom signed an act authorizing the formation of the institute. Ransom also appointed 11 men of high repute to serve as trustees. These men served unpaid. The institute&#x27;s first location was an office that was adjacent and owned by Mariners’ Church.

An ad published in 1852-53 issue of Detroit&#x27;s directory expressed the institute&#x27;s purpose at the time:

“&quot;The design of the Institution is to afford to those who are desirous of saving money, but who have not acquired sufficient to purchase a share in the banks, railroads, or a sum in public stocks, the means of employing their money to advantage…”&quot;

Unlike most banks of that time, the Institute paid interest on deposits, had no shareholders or capital stock, and was managed by unpaid fiduciaries. Courting customers from the working class, merchants and even children, the Institute enjoyed steady growth, reaching the $1 million mark in 1870.

In 1871, the state of Michigan passed a new law meant to encourage the formation of banks that offered both savings and commercial services. In response, the Institute transformed from a trust to a stockholder-owned corporation. Its name changed to The Detroit Savings Bank in 1871.

=== 1900s ===
In 1901, Detroit Savings Bank had 10,000 customers. By 1905, the bank had a staff of 21 employees, who managed a downtown main office and two branches.

As the banking situation in the nation became especially volatile in the 1930s, Detroit Savings Bank attempted to continue offering services. On multiple occasions in 1933, Detroit Savings Bank was the sole bank offering full personal and commercial services in Detroit. The Detroit Savings Bank changed its name to The Detroit Bank in 1936, being one of the few area banks to survive the Great Depression.

In 1956, the company merged with Birmingham National Bank, Ferndale National Bank and Detroit Wabeek Bank and Trust Company to form The Detroit Bank &amp; Trust Company. As the bank&#x27;s growth continued, so did its presence, opening its first foreign office in London in 1969. The early 1970s introduced new technological advancements to banking, which Detroit Bank &amp; Trust would adopt. These advancements include Master Charge cards and automated teller machines (ATM) such as the Ultra/Matic 24. In 1973, it formed a holding company, DetroitBank Corporation. A year later, the Bank &amp; Trust would celebrate its 125th anniversary. The current name, Comerica, was adopted in 1982.

In 1982, Comerica entered the Florida market. In 1983, it acquired its hometown rival, Bank of the Commonwealth of Michigan. In the same year, Comerica entered California and Texas markets by offering auto financing services. It strengthened its entrance into the Texas market in 1988 when it acquired Grand Bancshares. This was the first of 21 Texas acquisitions.

In 1990, Comerica received approval to construct a new headquarters building, One Detroit Center.

In 1991, the bank expanded to California by acquiring Plaza Commerce Bancorp and InBancshares.

In 1992, the bank merged with a similarly sized Detroit-based bank, Manufacturers National Corporation. The merger of Comerica and Manufacturers created one of the country&#x27;s 25 largest bank holding companies.

In 1996, the bank sold its Illinois operation to LaSalle Bank parent ABN Amro for $190 million.

In 1998, the bank signed a 30-year $66 million agreement for the naming rights to Comerica Park in downtown Detroit, home to the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball. A year later, Comerica would celebrate its 150th anniversary.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Comerica sold its credit card division to MBNA and formed an alliance with the company.

In 2001, the bank acquired Imperial Bank of California, which also had branches in Arizona.

In late 2004, the bank began a plan to diversify its operations by opening new banking centers in strong growth markets, primarily in Texas and California. Comerica opened 18 new banking centers in 2005, 25 new banking centers in 2006, and 30 banking centers in 2007.

On March 6, 2007, the company announced its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters to Dallas to move closer to its customer base in the Sun Belt. In August, the company announced that it selected 1717 Main Street in Downtown Dallas. The company executives began moving into the new location in November 2007 and the building was renamed Comerica Tower.

In January 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury selected the company as the issuing bank for its Direct Express debit card program. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments, such as Social Security benefits, to people who do not have bank accounts.

In July 2011, the bank acquired Sterling Bank of Texas for $1.03 billion. The acquisition virtually tripled Comerica&#x27;s market share in Houston and provided entry into the San Antonio and Kerrville regions.

In 2017, the bank announced plans to reduce its office space by 500,000 square feet, saving $7 million in 2018.

Comerica celebrated a historic milestone in 2019, marking its 170th anniversary.

In May 2021, the bank announced that it would provide $5 billion in small business loans from 2021 to 2023.

Comerica expanded into North Carolina with the creation of its new Southeast Market in August 2021. With market headquarters in Raleigh, along with offices in Winston-Salem and Charlotte, the Southeast Market supports Wealth and Commercial Bank customers based in North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

On May 29, 2023, American Banker reported that i2c Inc., a Comerica contractor, conducted Direct Express operations through an office in Pakistan, in violation of the bank&#x27;s contract with the Treasury, which requires all program operations to be conducted in the United States. The report caused Comerica&#x27;s stock price to fall.

<text>The Cuban night lizard (Cricosaura typica) is a night lizard (family Xantusiidae, subfamily Cricosaurinae) endemic to southern Cuba. It is the only member of the genus &quot;Cricosaura&quot;, one of three in the night lizard family.

==Etymology==
&quot;Cricosaura&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;krikos&quot; and &quot;saura&quot; meaning &quot;ring lizard&quot;, perhaps in reference to the rings of caudal scales.
The name &quot;typica&quot;, from the Greek word &quot;typikos&quot;, means &quot;typical&quot;.

==Description==
The Cuban night lizard differs from the other night lizards in possessing two frontonasal scales, one frontal scale, no parietal scale, and a fourth finger with four phalanges.
With a snout-vent length less than 4 cm it is the smallest of the night lizards.

==Distribution==
&quot;Cricosaura typica&quot; lives exclusively in the west corner of the southernmost coast of Cuba in the Provinces of Granma and Santiago de Cuba up to 200 m altitude. Known localities for Granma Province include: Hoyo de la Campana, Cabo Cruz (type locality); Vereón; Monte Gordo; Playa Las Coloradas; Currín; Agua Fina; Bosque Castillo; Belic; Bajada al Pesquero de la Alegría; Pesquero de la Alegría; Alegría de Pío/Municipio Niquero; 2.4 km SE of Ojo del Toro; Caleta Media Luna; Punta de Piedra; Alto de Mareón; Marea del Portillo; Camarón Grande. In the Santiago de Cuba Province the species is known only from La Mula (southern slopes of Sierra Maestra) and Uvero (ca. 80 km west of Santiago de Cuba on route 20, easternmost record).

==Habitat and natural history==
&quot;Cricosaura typica&quot; is a xerophilic species which hides under rocks, stones, logs, and debris in xeric forest and woods in microhabitats with at least some humidity. It is crepuscular and to some degree diurnal but lives very secretive. In their habitats it is quite common and can be easily collected during the day. In loose soil it progresses by snake-like wiggling and head movement. It feeds on insects (mainly ants), other small arthropods (Spiders, diplopods) and also on molluscs and gastropods.

&quot;Cricosaura typica&quot; is the only egg-laying species in the family Xantusiidae. At oviposition, mainly between April and June on Cuba, the white eggs are 9,4-10,7 mm long. Incubation time is up to 60 days. Hatchlings measure 15 mm from snout to vent. Longevity in captivity is reported up to 2 years 11 month.

==Conservation status==
This species is listened in Red List Category Vulnerable B2a,b(iii) for Cuba.
The main threat is the fragmentation and loss of habitat due to deforestation through human activities such as farming (minor crops), cutting down trees and setting fires. It is also threatened by the introduction of invasive alien animal species and adverse natural events. Although some of the populations of &quot;Cricosaura&quot; are situated in a protected area, the level of study and management are inadequate. The populations outside the boundaries of the protected area are the most threatened.

<text>The Cambridge Science Park, founded by Trinity College in 1970, is the oldest science park in the United Kingdom. It is a concentration of science and technology related businesses, and has strong links with the nearby University of Cambridge.

The science park is situated about 3 km to the north of Cambridge city centre, by junction 33 of the A14, in the parish of Milton, contiguous with Cambridge itself. The park is served by Cambridge North railway station and by the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway. It is directly adjacent to St John&#x27;s Innovation Centre and Cambridge Business Park.

==History ==

The land was originally given to Trinity College when the latter was founded by Henry VIII in 1546. The land was used for farming until the Second World War, when it was requisitioned by the US Army and used to prepare vehicles and tanks for D-Day. After the war, the land was left derelict until 1970, when, at the suggestion of Tony Cornell, and under the supervision of Sir John Bradfield, the college worked with Sir Francis Pemberton of Bidwells to develop it into a new centre for scientific enterprise and innovation.

In 2017, following decades of rapid expansion in Cambridge, the park appointed its first director and announced a large investment intended to improve facilities and reduce traffic congestion.

==Cambridge Fun Run==

The Cambridge Fun Run is a charity race for Children in Need organised and mainly entered by employees of businesses based in and around the Science Park. It has been held each November since 1989. Contestants compete in teams of four, some in fancy dress, running either one lap (as a group) or four laps (as a relay) of the Science Park ring road. The race begins and ends, and medals and trophies are awarded (for fastest runners and best costumes) in front of the Cambridge Consultants building.

<text>A science park (also called a &quot;university research park&quot;, &quot;technology park&quot;, &quot;technopark&quot;, &quot;technopolis&quot;, &quot;technopole&quot;, or a &quot;science and technology park&quot; [STP]) is defined as being a property-based development that accommodates and fosters the growth of tenant firms and that are affiliated with a university (or government and private research bodies) based on proximity, ownership, and/or governance. This is so that knowledge can be shared, innovation promoted, technology transferred, and research outcomes progressed to viable commercial products. Science parks are also often perceived as contributing to national economic development, stimulating the formation of new high-technology firms, attracting foreign investment and promoting exports.

== Background ==
The world&#x27;s first university research park, Stanford Research Park was launched in 1951 as a cooperative venture between Stanford University and the City of Palo Alto. Another early university research park was Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, which was launched in 1959. In 1969, Pierre Laffitte founded the Sophia Antipolis Science Park in France. Laffitte had travelled widely and developed a theory of &quot;cross-fertilisation&quot; where individuals could benefit mutually by the exchange of thoughts in many fields including culture, science and the arts.

Science parks are elements of the infrastructure of the global &quot;knowledge economy&quot;. They provide concentration that foster innovation and the development and commercialization of technology and where governments, universities and private companies may collaborate. The developers work in fields such as information technology, pharmaceuticals, science and engineering. Science parks may also offer a number of shared resources, such as incubators, programs and collaboration activities, uninterruptible power supply, telecommunications hubs, reception and security, management offices, bank offices, convention center, parking, and internal transportation.

Science parks also aim to bring together people who assist the developers of technology to bring their work to commercial fruition, for example, experts in intellectual property law. They can be attractive to university students who may interact with prospective employers and encourage students to remain in the local area.

Science parks may be designed to enhance the quality of life of the workers. For example, they might be built with sports facilities, restaurants, crèches or pleasant outdoor areas. Apart from tenants, science parks create jobs for the local community.

Science parks are specific locations and differ from the wider area high-technology business districts in that they are more organized, planned, and managed. They differ from science centres in that they lead to commercialized products from research. They differ from industrial parks which focus on manufacturing and from business parks which focus on business office locations.

Science parks are found worldwide. They are most common in developed countries. In North America there are over 170 science parks. For example, in the 1980s, North Carolina State University, Raleigh lacked space. New possible sites included the state mental-health property and the Diocese of Raleigh property on surrounding the Lake Raleigh Reservoir. The university&#x27;s Centennial Campus was developed. Sandia Science and Technology Park, NASA Research Park at Ames and the East Tennessee Technology Park at Oak Ridge National Laboratory are examples of research parks that have been developed by or adjacent to US Federal government laboratories.

Science and technology park (STP) activity across the European Union has approximately doubled over the last 11–12 years, driven by the growth of the longer standing parks and the emergence of new parks. There are now an estimated 366 STPs in the EU member states that manage about 28 million m2 of completed building floor space, hosting circa 40,000 organisations that employ approximately 750,000 people, mostly in high value added jobs. In the period from 2000 – 2012, total capital investment into EU STPs was circa €11.7 billion (central estimate). During the same period, STPs spent circa €3 billion on the professional business support and innovation services they either deliver or finance to assist both their tenants and other similar knowledge based businesses in their locality.

Increasingly, the reasons why STPs are sound investments for public sector support are becoming better understood and articulated. The evidence base shows that better STPs are not simply the landlords of attractive and well specified office style buildings. Rather, they are complex organisations, often with multiple owners having objectives aligned with important elements of economic development public policy as well as an imperative to be financially self-sustaining in the longer term.

== Definitions ==
The Association of University Research Parks (AURP), is a non-profit association consisting of university-affiliated science parks, almost entirely based in North America. It defines &quot;university research and science parks&quot; as &quot;property-based ventures with certain characteristics, including master planned property and buildings designed primarily for private/public research and development facilities, high technology and science based companies and support services; contractual, formal or operational relationships with one or more science or research institutions of higher education; roles in promoting the university&#x27;s research and development through industry partnerships, assisting in the growth of new ventures and promoting economic development; roles in aiding the transfer of technology and business skills between university and industry teams and roles in promoting technology-led economic development for the community or region.&quot;

The International Association of Science Parks and Areas of Innovation (IASP), the worldwide network of science parks and areas of innovation, defines a science park as &quot;an organisation managed by specialised professionals, whose main aim is to increase the wealth of its community by promoting the culture of innovation and the competitiveness of its associated businesses and knowledge-based institutions.
To enable these goals to be met, a Science Park stimulates and manages the flow of knowledge and technology amongst universities, R&amp;D institutions, companies and markets; it facilitates the creation and growth of innovation-based companies through incubation and spin-off processes; and provides other value-added services together with high quality space and facilities.&quot;.

The Cabral-Dahab Science Park Management Paradigm, was first presented by Regis Cabral in ten points in 1990. According to this management paradigm, a science park must: &quot;have access to qualified research and development personnel in the areas of knowledge in which the park has its identity; be able to market its high valued products and services; have the capability to provide marketing expertise and managerial skills to firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, lacking such a resource; be inserted in a society that allows for the protection of product or process secrets, via patents, security or any other means; be able to select or reject which firms enter the park&quot;. A science park should: &quot;have a clear identity, quite often expressed symbolically, as the park&#x27;s name choice, its logo or the management discourse; have a management with established or recognized expertise in financial matters, and which has presented long-term economic development plans; have the backing of powerful, dynamic and stable economic actors, such as a funding agency, political institution or local university; include in its management an active person of vision, with the power of decision and with the high and visible profile, who is perceived by relevant actors in society as embodying the interface between academia and industry, long-term plans and good management; and include a prominent percentage of consultancy firms, as well as technical service firms, including laboratories and quality control firms&quot;.

The World Intellectual Property Organization defines Science technology parks as territories usually affiliated with a university or a research institution, which accommodate and foster the growth of companies based therein through technology transfer and open innovation.

<text>Eduard von Bauernfeld (13 January 1802 – 9 August 1890), Austrian dramatist, was born at Vienna.

==Life==
Having studied jurisprudence at the University of Vienna, he entered the government service in a legal capacity, and after holding various minor offices was transferred in 1843 to a responsible post on the Lottery Commission. He had already embarked upon politics, and severely criticized the government in a pamphlet, &quot;Pie Desideria eines österreichischen Schriftstellers&quot; (1842); and in 1845 he made a journey to England, after which his political opinions became more pronounced. After the Revolution, in 1848, he quit the government service in order to devote himself entirely to letters. 
He lived in Vienna until his death, and was ennobled for his work.

As a writer of comedies and farces, Bauernfeld takes high rank among the German playwrights of the century; his plots are clever, the situations witty and natural and the diction elegant. His earliest essays, the comedies &quot;Leichtsinn aus Liebe&quot; (1831); &quot;Des Liebes-Protokoll&quot; (1831) and &quot;Die ewige Liebe&quot; (1834); &quot;Burgerlich und Romantisch&quot;, (1835) enjoyed great popularity. Later he turned his attention to so-called &quot;Salonstücke&quot; (drawing-room pieces), notably &quot;Aus der Gesellschaft&quot; (1866); &quot;Moderne Jugend&quot; (1869), and &quot;Der Landfrieden&quot; (1869), in which he portrays in fresh, bright and happy sallies the social conditions of the capital in which he lived.

A complete edition of Bauernfeld&#x27;s works, &quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot;, appeared in 12 vols. (Vienna, 1871–1873); &quot;Dramatischer Nachlass&quot;, ed. by F. von Saar (1893); selected works, ed. by E. Homer (4 vols., 1905). See A. Stern, &quot;Bauernfeld, Ein Dichterporträt&quot; (1890), Rudolf von Gottschall, &quot;E. von Bauernfeld&quot; (in &quot;Unsere Zeit&quot;, 1890), and E. Homer, &quot;Bauernfeld&quot; (1900).

From about 1825 (though he had met him earlier, and enjoyed some of his stage works) until his death in 1828, Bauernfeld was a friend of the composer Franz Schubert. The famous Schubert song &quot;An Sylvia&quot; used Bauernfeld&#x27;s translation of Shakespeare: Schubert also set a handful of original Bauernfeld poems. At his death Schubert left an unfinished opera &quot;Der Graf von Gleichen&quot; to a libretto by Bauernfeld. There are Memoirs of Schubert and his circle (including the painter Moritz von Schwind who Bauernfeld had known from the Gymnasium (school) in Vienna and remained close friends with until old age) from Bauernfeld in Deutsch&#x27;s book &quot;Schubert Memoirs by his friends&quot;.

Bauernfeld&#x27;s secret beloved was Clotilde Dornau (1805–1885).

He also used the pseudonyms &quot;Rusticocampus&quot; or &quot;Feld&quot;.

<doc id="590123" wikidata="Q1763868" url="?curid=590123" title="Everything Must Go (Steely Dan album)">
<text>Everything Must Go is the ninth and final studio album by American rock group Steely Dan. It was released on June 10, 2003, by Reprise Records. It was the band&#x27;s second album following their 20-year studio hiatus spanning 1980 through 2000, when they released &quot;Two Against Nature&quot;. &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; is the band&#x27;s most recent studio album and their last with founding member Walter Becker before his death in 2017.

==Background==
&quot;Godwhacker&quot; developed from a lyric Fagen wrote a few days after his mother died of Alzheimer&#x27;s. &quot;It&#x27;s about an elite squad of assassins whose sole assignment is to find a way into heaven and take out God&quot;, he later explained. &quot;If the deity actually existed, what sane person wouldn&#x27;t consider this to be justifiable homicide?&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical===

Upon its release, &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics. During a concert at Los Angeles&#x27; Greek Theatre on July 8, 2011, Donald Fagen said that he felt the album was &quot;underrated&quot;.

===Commercial===
&quot;Everything Must Go&quot; is the only Steely Dan album not to achieve a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.

===Legacy===
The album is frequently placed last on ranked lists of Steely Dan&#x27;s albums, with &quot;Stereogum&quot; music writer Zach Schonfeld writing in 2020 that the album &quot;seems to exist largely to make it easy for fans to identify the bottom rung in their Steely Dan album ranking&quot;. Writers for &quot;Stereogum&quot;, &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, and &quot;Louder&quot; each placed the album in ninth place (last place) when ranking Steely Dan&#x27;s discography from worst to best.

==Releases==
&quot;Everything Must Go&quot; was also released as a DVD-audio disc with a multi-channel mix. And now an SACD newly remastered from the original analog tape by Bernie Grundman direct to DSD. A special two-disc edition of &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; (one CD, one DVD) was released. The DVD, &#x27;Steely Dan Confessions&#x27;, follows Becker and Fagen touring Las Vegas after hours in a taxi promoting the album in a special version of the cult HBO cable show &quot;Taxicab Confessions&quot;, hosted by cabbie Rita.

He is best known for his portrayal of tough-guy, criminal characters, and has starred in films such as &quot;American Me&quot; (1992), &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987), &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), &quot;Gotti&quot; (1996), &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rejects&quot; (2005).

<text>Two Against Nature is the eighth studio album by American rock band Steely Dan. Their first studio album in 20 years, it was recorded from 1997 to 1999 and released on February 29, 2000, by Giant Records.

A critical success, &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; won the group four Grammy Awards: Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Engineered Album – Non-Classical, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals (for the single &quot;Cousin Dupree&quot;). Commercially, it peaked at number six on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and sold more than one million copies, earning a Platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Two Against Nature&quot; was met with both commercial and critical success. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 13 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Writing in March 2000 for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau applauded the music as an excellent &quot;rock comeback&quot; and a &quot;jumpier and snappier, sourer and trickier and less soothing&quot; iteration of the jazz pop featured on Steely Dan&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Aja&quot;, describing it as &quot;postfunk&quot;. Thematically, he found it unified by fictitious yet revelatory accounts of &quot;dirty old men&quot; seeking &quot;validation&quot; and &quot;excitement&quot; in their sex lives, which are &quot;full of heady infatuations and random acts of cruelty, self-interest and self-hate, vicious cycles blowing hot and cold&quot;, all conveying &quot;the urgency of attraction&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic appreciated the &quot;sharp humor&quot; in the lyrics, but was especially impressed by the music&#x27;s &quot;depth and character&quot;, as he observed &quot;nearly endless permutations within their signature sound&quot;. A dissenting view came from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Brent DiCrescenzo, who dismissed the songs as &quot;lengthy, indistinguishable&quot; and &quot;glossy bop-pop&quot; while suggesting Steely Dan lack &quot;soul&quot;.

At the 2001 Grammy Awards, &quot;Two Against Nature&quot; earned Steely Dan won in the categories of Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Best Engineered Album – Non-Classical, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals (for the single &quot;Cousin Dupree&quot;). For these awards, the band was in competition with younger, more popular recording acts such as NSYNC, Britney Spears, Radiohead, Beck, and Eminem. According to &quot;Stereogum&quot; writer Zach Schonfeld, Steely Dan&#x27;s success at the Grammys represented a &quot;revenge of the [baby] boomers&quot; and contributed to resentment among younger listeners toward the band: &quot;[T]he sight of two smug jazz-rock nerds collecting their Grammy from Stevie Wonder as Radiohead and Beck went home nearly empty-handed—helps explain why so many Gen X-ers and old millennials grew up loathing both Steely Dan and the Grammys in equal measure. Needless to say, Steely Dan&#x27;s elliptical character studies set to yacht rock sleaze didn&#x27;t speak to disaffected American youth the way, say, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; did.&quot;

Steely Dan&#x27;s supporting tour of North America, Europe, and Japan was equally successful, encouraging them to record the 2003 album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;.

<doc id="590135" wikidata="Q158260" url="?curid=590135" title="Army Group Centre">
<text>Army Group Centre () was the name of two distinct strategic German Army Groups that fought on the Eastern Front in World War II. The first Army Group Centre was created during the planning of Operation Barbarossa, Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union, as one of the three German Army formations assigned to the invasion.

After Army Group North was trapped in the Courland Pocket in mid-1944, it was renamed to Army Group Courland and the first Army Group Centre was renamed &quot;Army Group North&quot;. The second iteration of Army Group Centre was formed by the redesignation of Army Group A as the replacement for the first Army Group Centre.

== Formation and Command ==
The army group was officially created by Adolf Hitler when he issued Führer Directive 21 on 18 December 1940, ordering German forces to prepare for an attack on Soviet Russia in 1941. The first commanding officer of Army Group Centre was Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, who would lead it until he was relieved on 18 December 1941 after the failure of the Battle of Moscow and was replaced by Field Marshal Günther von Kluge. 

Günther von Kluge would remain the army group&#x27;s commander until he was injured in October 1943 and replaced by Field Marshal Ernst Busch, who would then be replaced by Field Marshal Walter Model in June 1944. When Model was transferred to the Western Front in August 1944, he was replaced by Ferdinand Schörner, who would command the army group until his desertion in May 1945 after Germany surrendered to the Allies.

===Order of battle at formation===
==Campaign and operational history==

=== Operation Barbarossa ===
On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany and its Axis allies launched their surprise offensive into the Soviet Union. Their armies, totaling over three million men, were to advance in three geographical directions. Army Group Centre&#x27;s initial strategic goal was to defeat the Soviet armies in Belarus and occupy Smolensk. To accomplish this, the army group planned for a rapid advance using Blitzkrieg operational methods for which purpose it commanded two panzer groups rather than one. A quick and decisive victory over the Soviet Union was expected by mid-November. The Army Group&#x27;s other operational missions were to support the army groups on its northern and southern flanks, the army group boundary for the later being the Pripyat River.

;September 1941 order of battle

Bitter fighting in the Battle of Smolensk as well as the Lötzen decision delayed the German advance for two months. The advance of Army Group Centre was further delayed as Hitler ordered a postponement of the offensive against Moscow in order to conquer Ukraine first.

;November 1941 order of battle

The commander in chief as of 19 December 1941 was Günther von Kluge (for a short time before Christmas of 1941, this role was fulfilled by Günther Blumentritt).

=== Rzhev operations ===

1942 opened for Army Group Centre with continuing attacks from Soviet forces around Rzhev. The German Ninth Army was able to repel these attacks and stabilise its front, despite continuing large-scale partisan activity in its rear areas. Meanwhile, the German strategic focus on the Eastern Front shifted to southwestern Russia, with the launching of Operation Blue in June. This operation, aimed at the oilfields in the southwestern Caucasus, involved Army Group South alone, with the other German army groups giving up troops and equipment for the offensive.

Despite the focus on the south, Army Group Centre continued to see fierce fighting throughout the year. While the Soviet attacks in early 1942 had not driven the Germans back, they had resulted in several Red Army units being trapped behind German lines. Eliminating the pockets took until July, the same month in which the Soviets made another attempt to break through the army group&#x27;s front; the attempt failed, but the front line was pushed back closer to Rzhev. The largest Soviet operation in the army group&#x27;s sector that year, Operation Mars, took place in November. It was launched concurrently with Operation Uranus, the counteroffensive against the German assault on Stalingrad. The operation was repulsed with very heavy Soviet losses, although it did have the effect of pinning down German units that could have been sent to the fighting around Stalingrad.

=== Campaign in central Russia ===
Following the disaster of Stalingrad and poor results of the Voronezh defensive operations, the army high command expected another attack on Army Group Centre in early 1943. However, Hitler had decided to strike first. Before this strike could be launched, Operation Büffel was launched to forestall any possible Soviet spring offensives, by evacuating the Rzhev Salient to shorten the frontline.

==== Belarusian anti-partisan campaign ====

The following major anti-partisan operations were conducted in the rear of Army Group Centre, alongside many smaller operations:

*Operation &quot;Bamberg&quot;: conducted 26 March – 6 April 1942 by the 707th Infantry Division supported by a Slovakian regiment, south of Bobruisk. At least 5,000 people (including many civilians) were killed and agricultural produce was confiscated.
*Operation &quot;Fruhlingsfest&quot;: conducted 17 April – 12 May 1944 in the area of Polotsk by units of &quot;Gruppe von Gottberg&quot;. Around 7,000 deaths were recorded at the hands of German forces.
*Operation &quot;Kormoran&quot;: conducted 25 May – 17 June 1944 between Minsk and Borisov by German security units in the rear of Third Panzer Army. Around 7,500 deaths recorded.

Increasing coordination of the partisan activity resulted in the conducting of Operation Concert against the German forces.

== Destruction of Army Group Centre ==
In the spring of 1944, the Soviet High Command started concentrating forces along the front line in central Russia for a summer offensive against Army Group Centre. The Red Army also carried out a deception campaign to convince the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; that the main Soviet summer offensive would be launched further south, against Army Group North Ukraine. The German High Command was fooled and armored units were moved south out of Army Group Centre.

The Soviet offensive, code-named Operation Bagration, was launched on 22 June 1944, the third anniversary of Germany&#x27;s own invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. 185 Red Army divisions, comprising 2.3 million soldiers and 4,000 tanks and assault guns, smashed into the German positions on a 200km-wide front. The 850,000-strong Army Group Centre was almost completely destroyed by the attack. It is estimated that over 450,000 Germans were killed, wounded, or captured, notably the 57,000 soldiers captured east of Minsk, who were paraded through Moscow on 17 July on Stalin&#x27;s orders as proof of the immense success of the Soviet offensive. The Soviet forces raced forward, liberating Minsk and the rest of Belorussia by mid-July, and reaching the Vistula and the Baltic States by early August. In terms of casualties this was the greatest German defeat of the entire war.

The commander in chief of Army Group Centre as of 28 June 1944 was Walter Model.

=== Defensive campaign in Poland and Slovakia ===
Discussion of the army group&#x27;s situation in January 1945 should note that the army groups in the east changed names later that month. The force known as &quot;Army Group Centre&quot; at the start of the Soviet Vistula-Oder Offensive on 12 January 1945 was renamed &quot;Army Group North&quot; less than two weeks after the offensive commenced. At the start of the Vistula-Oder Offensive, the Soviet forces facing Army Group Centre outnumbered the Germans on average by 2:1 in troops, 3:1 in artillery, and 5.5:1 in tanks and self-propelled artillery. The Soviet superiority in troop strength grows to almost 3:1 if 200,000 Volkssturm militia are not included in German personnel strength totals.

=== Defence of the Reich campaign ===
On 25 January 1945, Hitler renamed three army groups. Army Group North became Army Group Courland, Army Group Centre became Army Group North, and Army Group A became Army Group Centre. Army Group Centre fought in the defence of Slovakia and Bohemia-Moravia as well as sections of the German heartland.

Between January and February 1945, Army Group Centre sustained 140,000 casualties, including 15,000 dead, 77,000 wounded (not counting non-evacuees), and 48,000 missing.

==== Battle of Berlin ====
The last Soviet campaign of the war in the European theater, which led to the fall of Berlin and the end of the war in Europe with the surrender of all German forces to the Allies. The three Soviet Fronts involved in the campaign had altogether 2.5 million men, 6,250 tanks, 7,500 aircraft, 41,600 artillery pieces and mortars, 3,255 truck-mounted Katyusha rocket launchers (nicknamed &quot;Stalin Organs&quot; by the Germans), and 95,383 motor vehicles. The campaign started with the battle of Oder-Neisse. Army Group Centre commanded by Ferdinand Schörner (the commander in chief as of 17 January 1945) had a front that included the river Neisse. Before dawn on the morning of 16 April 1945 the 1st Ukrainian Front under the command of General Konev started the attack over the river Neisse with a short but massive bombardment by tens of thousands of artillery pieces.

==== Battle of Prague ====
Some of the Army Group Centre continued to resist until 11 May 1945, by which time the overwhelming force of the Soviet Armies sent to liberate Czechoslovakia in the Prague Offensive gave them no option but to surrender or be killed.

== Surrender ==
By 7 May 1945, the day that German Chief-of-Staff General Alfred Jodl was negotiating surrender of all German forces at SHAEF, the German Armed Forces High Command (AFHC) had not heard from Schörner since 2 May 1945. He had reported that he intended to fight his way west and surrender his army group to the Americans. On 8 May 1945, a colonel from the Allied Forces High Command was escorted through the American lines to see Schörner. The colonel reported that Schörner had ordered the men under his operational command to observe the surrender but that he could not guarantee that he would be obeyed everywhere. Later that day, Schörner deserted his command and flew to Austria where on 18 May 1945 he was arrested by the Americans.

<text>Queen&#x27;s College () is the first public secondary school founded by the British colonial government in Hong Kong. It was initially named The Government Central School () in 1862 and later renamed Victoria College () in 1890, and finally obtained the present name of Queen&#x27;s College in 1894. It is currently located in Causeway Bay.
== Brief history ==

The history of the college can be traced back to the Chinese village schools that were believed to have existed prior to the founding of British Hong Kong as a colony in 1842.

In August 1847, the British colonial government decreed that grants would be given to existing Chinese village schools in Hong Kong. It appointed an Education Committee in November of that year to examine the state of Chinese schools in Victoria, Stanley and Aberdeen, the aim being to bring the schools under closer government supervision. Following its examinations, the Committee reported that 3 Chinese village schools, namely Taipingshan School (28 pupils), Chungwan School (18 pupils) and Sheungwan School (21 pupils) were operating actively within Victoria City under Chinese masters Mr. Chuy Shing-cheung, Mr. Leung Sing-Than and Mr. Mak Mai-chun, respectively. The books used in these schools included the Three Character Classics (三字經), and the Four Books and the Five Classics (四書五經). This marked the beginning of the establishment of public education in Hong Kong. Subsequently, government intervention in the provision of education in Hong Kong increased, and in 1857, it established new schools, including West Point School, to meet the ever-increasing demand for education in the burgeoning entrepôt.

In 1860, the British sinologist Rev. Dr. James Legge proposed that the Board of Education establish a Central School that would amalgamate the 3 existing government sponsored and monitored Chinese schools (Taipingshan, Chungwan and Sheungwan) in Victoria City. Two years later, a Government Central School on Gough Street, Central, opened its doors to the public in 1862. Its first headmaster was Dr. Frederick Stewart, who was also appointed Inspector of Schools in the Colony. As Headmaster, he was responsible for the supervision of all schools in Hong Kong until March 1879, when the Government established a separate office for the Inspector; this later became the precursor to the Department of Education, which was then incorporated into the Education Bureau.

In its first five years, the school admitted only Chinese students as a matter of policy. In 1867, it began admitting students of other nationalities, such as British, Indian, Parsee, Japanese and Thai. While Chinese students had to enroll in English classes, students from other nationalities were not expected to study the Chinese classics.

Secular schooling sparked a great deal of controversy with the Hong Kong Governor and religious leaders. On many occasions, the Governor personally scrutinized and intervened in the operations of these schools. Later, the Government established a grant program that enabled religious schools to compete on par with the Central School for funding.

On 26 April 1884, a foundation stone was laid on Aberdeen Street for the school&#x27;s new premises by Sir George Bowen, Governor from 1883 to 1887. Witnessing the ceremony was Sun Yat-sen, then a student at the school. On the Governor&#x27;s recommendation, the school was to be renamed Victoria College following the completion of the new building.

In 1889, construction of the school was completed at a cost of HKD250,000, making it one of the largest and most expensive buildings in Hong Kong at that time.

In 1894, the school was officially renamed Queen&#x27;s College. Since the 1870s, the Government had wanted to expand the college to become a university; however, the idea was scrapped after the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. Fearing that the benefits it enjoyed in the Far-East could be jeopardized by Japan&#x27;s growing influence in the region, the British colonial government decided that it was crucial to establish a university that could train graduates in war-related subjects, such as engineering and medicine. While Queen&#x27;s College remained a secondary school, this eventually led to the establishment of the University of Hong Kong in 1910.

Following the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, the school was forced to close, after which it was converted into a Field hospital. Immediately after the fall of Hong Kong, refugees stripped the buildings of their timber for fuel. During the Japanese occupation, the school site was used by Japanese Occupying Forces. As a result, the campus was destroyed during an Allied bombing attack near the end of the War (1944 or 1945). For a brief period after, its ruins were occupied by refugees following the Japanese surrender, and fire accidents were common. Beginning in 1948, the site was cleared to make way for the PMQ.

In 1947, the school re-opened in a temporary facility on Kennedy Road, sharing a campus with Clementi Secondary School.

In 1950, a new campus of Queen&#x27;s College was built in Causeway Bay to accommodate the school&#x27;s expansion. It moved to the present site on Causeway Road, opposite Victoria Park, on 22 September. That day, Sir Alexander Grantham, Governor of Hong Kong, announced the re-opening of Queen&#x27;s College. Since then, the two-storey high building has served countless numbers of Q.C. students.

Until 1951, pupils typically entered Queen&#x27;s College at Class 4 (equivalent to today&#x27;s Form 3). In September 1951, two additional grades were created at the bottom end of the school, the lowest grade thus becoming Class 6 (Form 1 today). For a time, these changes in organization and other factors, resulting from the rapid growth of education, led to an uneven distribution of divisions. In 1950 for instance, there were ten divisions of Class 4. In 1951, four of these divisions were transferred to King&#x27;s College (英皇書院). From 1955, undergraduates intending to focus on the Arts were transferred to King&#x27;s College and later to Belilios Public School for their Advanced Level year. From 1962, an extra Upper Sixth Form was provided to arts students so that QC boys would no longer have to study at Belilios. Meanwhile, for a brief period, Belilios Girls were sent over to Queen&#x27;s to study Science. Since then, Queen&#x27;s College has remained a full-time Anglo-Chinese secondary school for boys.

== School Logo ==
At Queen&#x27;s College, school logos were only officially adopted after the Second World War. Prior to the War, the school, like other government departments, used the Royal Emblem as its logo. However, Queen&#x27;s College&#x27;s first school logo was designed as early as 1923 by Mr Ng Ping-un, Chief Chinese draftsman of the Architectural Office. The post-war school logo changed numerous times, all of them based on Ng&#x27;s 1923 design. The school&#x27;s current logo was adopted in 1997 after the Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong.

== List of Top Scorers in Public Examinations ==
Queen&#x27;s College has produced the highest number of perfect achievers in the history of Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) and Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE), with 57 perfect scorers &quot;10As&quot; in HKCEE and 14 &quot;Top Scorers&quot; and &quot;Super Top Scorers&quot; in HKDSE.

7 x 5** &quot;Top Scorers&quot; are candidates who obtained perfect scores of 5** in each of the four core subjects and three electives.

8 x 5** &quot;Super Top Scorers&quot; are candidates who obtained seven Level 5** in four core subjects and three electives, and an additional Level 5** in the Mathematics Extended (M1/M2) module.

== Activities and achievements ==
There are 49 clubs grouped under Sports, Recreational, Religious, Social Services, and Academic (Science &amp; Arts) areas. Most clubs hold events and functions for the participation of all students and many of them organize joint events with sister schools throughout every academic year. They also actively participate in annual school Open Days.

=== Hong Kong Outstanding Students Awards ===
Queen&#x27;s College students have won 21 of the past Hong Kong Outstanding Students Awards, placing the school in 2nd place among all secondary schools in Hong Kong. Of the 45 winners and finalists, 21 have served on the executive committee of the Hong Kong Outstanding Students&#x27; Association (HKOSA)

=== Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Outstanding Students Awards ===
Queen&#x27;s College counts a total of seven winners and finalists of the Hong Kong Outstanding Students Awards from 2002 to 2017.

== Publications ==

First published in June 1899, the Queen&#x27;s College school magazine, &quot;The Yellow Dragon&quot; (《黃龍報》), is the world&#x27;s oldest existing Anglo-Chinese school magazine. A priceless historical resource, it provides a window into the evolution of education in Hong Kong and on societal evolution in the Asia Pacific region. In 2005, the magazine published its 100th volume. The Chinese section of the edition featured a brief summary of the magazine&#x27;s past 100 volumes (百期回望專輯), written by seven students to commemorate the special occasion.

Another regular publication is the school newspaper, &quot;The Courier&quot; (《文苑》), which has been published since 1968. Currently, 3 issues are produced each year, covering the school&#x27;s major functions and featuring student contributions.

In commemoration of the school&#x27;s 125th anniversary, the Queen&#x27;s College Old Boys&#x27; Association published a limited-edition history of the school entitled &quot;Queen&#x27;s College: Its History 1862-1987&quot; in 1987. Its author, Gwyneth Stokes, whose husband John was the Principal of Queen&#x27;s College from 1965 to 1970, spent 2 years researching the 494-page book in local archives and in the UK.

== Scandals ==

In 2006, it was reported that two Queen&#x27;s College students robbed a Chinese Medicine Practitioner in his clinic in Shanghai Street, Jordan with cutters and towels soaked with chloroform.

Mr. Chiu Sin Hang, an assistant principal on probation, was involved in several scandals:

* Pressing students to support the police in school magazine: The Queen&#x27;s College Political Reform Concern Group revealed that Assistant Principal Chiu Sin Hang requested a change in topic to &quot;police force&quot; in the latest &quot;The Yellow Dragon&quot; at that time, in the hopes of supporting the local police force which has suffered a negative image in the Umbrella Movement. &quot;The Yellow Dragon&quot; later released a statement confirming the request from Chiu and stated that principal Ms. Li Sui-wah rejected said request. This event caused outrage not just between students and alumni as it inflected students&#x27; freedom in expression and created unnecessary burden on the students in charge.
* Failure to declare interests attained in beer-drinking contest: Assistant Principal Chiu Sin Hang attended a dinner event held by the Queen&#x27;s College Old Boys&#x27; Association in which he participated in a beer-drinking contest and prevailed. He won a travel coupon to Macau of around $5000 in value. It was alleged that Chiu did not declare the said prize to his senior or the Education Bureau, breaching the &quot;Civil Service Code&quot; and the &quot;Prevention of Bribery Ordinance&quot;, albeit the School Principal was attending the same event and noticing his winning the contest and the travel coupon.

History

The Queen&#x27;s College History Gallery was established in 2013 to illustrate the history of the school and to serve as an archive for preserving and restoring school-related artifacts, documents and relevant publications. To give the 4000-piece strong collection and exhibition a more favourable environment, a new purpose-built museum converted from several classrooms was completed and opened on 23 January 2017. Renamed the Queen&#x27;s College History Museum, it currently hosts a permanent exhibition entitled &quot;From Gough Street to Causeway Road: Change and Continuity of Queen&#x27;s College&quot; curated by Old Boys Honorary Curators. 

List of Special Exhibitions

<text>Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Umar ibn Waqid al-Aslami () ( – 207 AH; commonly referred to as al-Waqidi (Arabic: ; c. 747 – 823 AD) was an early Muslim historian and biographer of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, specializing in his military campaigns. His surname is derived from his grandfather&#x27;s name Waqid, and thus he became famous as al-Imam al-Waqidi. He served as a judge (&quot;qadi&quot;) for the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun. Several of al-Waqidi&#x27;s works are known through his scribe and student (in the field of the &quot;al-maghazi&quot; genre), Ibn Sa&#x27;d.

==Biography==
Al-Waqidi was born in Medina around 748 AD (130 AH). He was the mawla (client) of ‘Abd Allah ibn Burayda of the Banu Aslam of Medina. According to Abu Faraj al-Isfahani, al-Waqidi’s mother was the daughter of ‘Isa ibn Ja‘far ibn Sa’ib Khathir, a Persian, and the great-granddaughter of Sa’ib, who introduced music to Medina. Amongst his prominent teachers were Ibn Abi Thahab Ma&#x27;mar bin Rashid, Malik ibn Anas and Sufyan al-Thawri. He lived in Medina at the time of Abu Hanifa and Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq and studied in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi as a student of Malik ibn Anas. Al-Waqidi also had access to the grandchildren of Muhammad&#x27;s companions. Al-Waqidi originally earned a living as a wheat trader, but when a calamity struck at the age of 50, he migrated to Iraq during the reign of Harun ar-Rashid. He was appointed a judge of eastern Baghdad, and Harun ar-Rashid&#x27;s heir al-Ma&#x27;mun later appointed him the &quot;qadi&quot; of a military camp at Resafa.

Al-Waqidi concentrated on history, and was acknowledged as a master of the genre by many of his peers. His books on the early Islamic expeditions and conquests predate much of the Sunni and Shia literature of the later Abbasid period. His works regarding the battles of Muhammad and his companions were considered reliable by most early Islamic scholars. While still regarded as an important source for early Islamic history, later authors debated the reliability of his works. Western orientalists who enjoyed his writings include Martin Lings.

==Works==
Al-Waqidi is primarily known for his &quot;Kitab al-Tarikh wa al-Maghazi&quot; (Arabic: كتاب التاريخ والمغازي, &quot;Book of History and Campaigns&quot;), which is the only part of his corpus that has been fully preserved. It describes the battles fought by Muhammad, as well as Muhammad&#x27;s life in the city of Medina. The work draws upon the earlier &quot;sira&quot; of Ibn Ishaq, though it includes details not found in Ibn Ishaq&#x27;s text.

A number of works chronicling the Islamic conquests have been attributed to al-Waqidi, though most of these attributions are now believed to be mistaken. &quot;Futuh al-Sham&quot; (Arabic: كتاب فتوح الشام, &quot;Book of the Conquests of Syria&quot;), a novelization of the Islamic army&#x27;s conquests of Byzantine Syria, has traditionally been ascribed to al-Waqidi. Modern scholars generally classify &quot;Futuh al-Sham&quot; as a falsely-attributed later work, dating it to around the time of the Crusades, though some scholars believe a small portion of the text may be traced back to al-Waqidi. In addition to depicting the battles of the Islamic armies, the work also details the valor of various Muslim women, including Hind bint Utbah, Khawlah bint al-Azwar, and Asma bint Abi Bakr.

According to Ibn al-Nadim, al-Waqidi authored a book detailing the death of Husayn ibn Ali, though this work has not survived. Other lost texts attributed to al-Waqidi include a book chronicling the last days of Muhammad&#x27;s life. The works of al-Waqidi&#x27;s student Ibn Sa&#x27;d may contain some excerpts from these texts.

==Islamic criticism==
Waqidi has faced criticism regarding his scholarly reliability from many later Sunni Islamic scholars, including:

* al-Shafi’i (150-204 A.H.) said &quot;All the books of al-Waqidi are lies. In Medina there were seven men who used to fabricate authorities, one of which was al-Waqidi.&quot;
* Yahya ibn Ma&#x27;in (158-233 A.H.) said &quot;He is weak. He is nothing. Not reliable!&quot;
* Ali ibn al-Madini (161-241 A.H.)said &quot;He fabricates Hadith&quot;
* Ishaq ibn Rahwayh (161-238 A.H.) said &quot;According to my view, he is one of those who fabricate Hadith&quot;
* Ahmad ibn Hanbal (164-241 A.H.) said &quot;He is a liar, makes alternations in the traditions&quot;
* Abu Zur’a al-Razi (193-264 A.H.) said &quot;(Waqidi&#x27;s writing) Abandoned, Weak&quot;
* Al-Bukhari (194-256 A.H.) said &quot;al-Waqidi has been abandoned in hadith. He fabricates hadith&quot;
* Abu Hatim Muhammad ibn Idris al-Razi (195-277 A.H.) said &quot;He fabricates hadith. We have abandoned his hadith&quot;
* Abu Dawood (202-275 A.H.) said &quot;I do not write his hadith and I do not report (hadith) on his authority. I have no doubt that he used to make up hadith&quot;
* al-Baladhuri (207-278 A.H.) said &quot;al-Waqidi is &quot;matruk&quot; (known as a liar).
* Al-Nasa’i (214-303 A.H.) said &quot;The liars known for fabricating the hadith of the Messenger of Allah are four. They are: Ibn Abi Yahya in Medina, al-Waqidi in Baghdad, Muqatil ibn Sulayman in Khurasan and Muhammad ibn Sa&#x27;id in Syria.&quot;
* Ibn ‘Adi (277-365 A.H.) said &quot;His traditions are not safe and there is danger from him (in accepting his traditions)&quot;
* Al-Daraqutni (306-385 A.H.) said &quot;There is weakness in him (in his reporting)&quot;
* Al-Nawawi (631-676 A.H.): said &quot;Their (muhaddithin scholars) consensus is that al-Waqidi is weak&quot;
* Al-Dhahabi (675-748 A.H.) said &quot;Consensus has taken place on the weakness of al-Waqidi&quot;
* Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (773-852 A.H.)said &quot;He has been abandoned in spite of vastness of his knowledge&quot;
* Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani (1914-1999 C.E.) said that al-Waqidi is a liar.

Even among those who questioned his authenticity many still considered him a pillar in history and accepted his narrations in this regard. Ibn Hajar Asqalani records: &quot;He is acceptable in the narrations of the battles according to our companions and Allah knows the best.&quot;

Some of his criticisms are written in books written centuries later even though the claimed criticisms are made by people who were born around his time.

==Western criticism==
Patricia Crone gives al-Waqidi as an example of the phenomenon whereby the farther an Islamic commentary on Muhammad&#x27;s life was removed in time from his life and the events in the Quran, the more information it provided. 
If one storyteller should happen to mention a raid, the next storyteller would know the date of this raid, while the third would know everything that an audience might wish to hear about. 
This was despite the fact later commentaries depended on the earlier sources for their content, which suggested that if later commentaries differed in length from earlier work they should be briefer as some facts about the early days were lost or forgotten. (Crone attributed the phenomenon to storytellers&#x27; embellishment.)
Commentary works of Al-Waqidi were much larger than those of the oldest prophetic biography Ibn Ishaq (died 767) despite the fact that al-Waqidi&#x27;s later works covered a shorter period of time (only Muhammad&#x27;s period in Medina).
Waqidi will always give precise dates, locations, names, where Ibn Ishaq has none, accounts of what triggered the expedition, miscellaneous information to lend color to the event ... But given that this information was all unknown to Ibn Ishaq, its value is doubtful in the extreme. And if spurious information accumulated at this rate in the two generations between Ibn Ishaq and al-Waqidi, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that even more must have accumulated in the three generations between the Prophet and Ibn Ishaq. 

Historian Michael Cook gives an example of the difference in accounts of the death of Muhammad&#x27;s father Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib. Ibn Ishaq relates that some say he died while Muhammad&#x27;s mother was pregnant with Muhammad was born and some while Muhammad was 28 months old; another commentator (Ma&#x27;mar ibn Rashid) says that he died in Yathrib after being sent there to lay stores of dates. About a half a century later al-Waqidi relates that 
&#x27;Abdallah had gone to Gaza on business, had fallen ill on the way back, and died in Yathrib after leaving the caravan he was with to be nursed by relations there. Waqidi was further able to specify Abdallah&#x27;s age at death and the exact place of his burial. ...[that the death] took place ... while Muhammad was still in the womb, 
and that while there were &quot;other accounts of the matter&quot; his was the best.

<text>Chemikal Underground is an independent record label set up in 1994 at Glasgow, Scotland, by rock band The Delgados. It was set up to release their first single, &quot;Monica Webster&quot; / &quot;Brand New Car&quot; and went on to break many new Scottish bands in the nineties.

When the second Chemikal Underground release by Bis, &quot;The Secret Vampire Soundtrack EP&quot; was successful, earning them a slot on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the label was able to expand. To date, &quot;The Secret Vampire Soundtrack&quot; is the only Top 40 hit released on Chemikal Underground. Further success followed with the debut albums by Mogwai and Arab Strap. Other bands on the Chemikal Underground roster included Magoo, Aereogramme, Cha Cha Cohen, Sluts of Trust, Suckle, the Radar Brothers and more recently Mother and the Addicts and De Rosa, as well as Arab Strap member Malcolm Middleton&#x27;s solo work. In 2000, they launched Fukd ID to release limited edition (1000 each of CD and 12&quot;) singles by bands not necessarily on their roster, such as Interpol (Fukd ID #3).

==Artists&#x27; opinions==
Chris Connick from De Rosa stated that: Chemikal Underground were a huge influence on my musical tastes when I was growing up. It was really exciting to hear bands such as Mogwai, The Delgados and Arab Strap, all guys who grew up in the same place as myself, write such amazing music, get played on the radio etc, and do it all off their own back. I hugely admire the members of The Delgados for starting Chemikal and affecting Scottish musical culture in such a positive manner. In fact, it was probably The Delgados that made me want to be in a band, so to have them as your ”boss” is a uniquely warm feeling. To even be considered in the same category as any of the label’s bands is a total honour and I am very proud to be linked to Chemikal Underground’s esteemed heritage.

While Rick Anthony, of The Phantom Band, noted that: Chemikal Underground have been really pretty good to us so far and they have released some great records over the years - which makes you feel like they know what they are doing, and that they are in it for the right reasons. They all seem like good people as well, and they don’t meddle in the creative side of things at all.

<doc id="590174" wikidata="Q316500" url="?curid=590174" title="Talisay, Cebu">
<text>Talisay, officially the City of Talisay (; ), is a component city in the province of Cebu, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 263,048 people, making it the most populous component city in Visayas. The city is applying for a Highly Urbanized City (HUC) status.

The city&#x27;s name is taken from the talisay tree which is abundant in the area.
==History==

Talisay was founded in 1648 as an estate owned by the Augustinians. In 1849, it was converted into a municipality with its first gobernadorcillo, Silverio Fernandez.

During both the American colonial period and World War II, Talisay served as a haven of colonial military forces. The municipality served as the center of guerrilla intelligence operations for the Philippine resistance movement in Cebu during World War II. The returning United States liberation forces landed on the beaches of Talisay on March 26, 1945. This was part of Operation Victor II which was implemented by General Douglas MacArthur in order to regain the islands of Cebu, Bohol, and Negros from the Japanese soldiers. With the joint efforts of the US forces, the Philippine Commonwealth forces, and the Cebuano guerrillas, Cebu was liberated on March 27, 1945, and the Japanese forces in the province eventually surrendered on August 29. To remember this victory and as an honor to the Cebuano veterans, Philippine Republic Act No. 7280 was enacted in 1992 which declared March 26 of every year a special non-working holiday in the municipality of Talisay, Cebu. Later in 2013, the law was expanded under Republic Act No. 10359, so that the holiday will be celebrated in the entire province of Cebu.

===Cityhood===

In 2000, the municipality of Talisay was converted into a city through &quot;Republic Act No. 8979&quot;. The municipality is now linked to Cebu City via the South Coastal Highway from Lawaan which was opened in 2004. This brought some recent inward investment in the form of subdivisions, but some were hastily planned, and thus were plagued by problems. Conflict occurred between the residents of the mountain barangay of Maghaway and those of Crown Asia&#x27;s Azienda Milan and Venezia subdivisions.

==Geography==
Primarily a residential and trading center, Talisay lies within the Metro Cebu area. It is bordered to the north by Cebu City, to the west is the city of Toledo, to the east is the Cebu Strait, and to the south is the town of Minglanilla.

Talisay is from Cebu City, the provincial capital.

===Barangays===
Talisay is politically subdivided into 22 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.








===Climate===
==Demographics==
In 2017, Talisay City was the most densely populated city in the Cebu province. This ranking does not include highly urbanized cities: Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu, &amp; Mandaue. There were 5,710 people living per square kilometer.

Cebuano is the predominant language of the inhabitants of the city (96%).

===Religion===

Talisay City has a Roman Catholic majority population. It also has sizeable Protestant and non-Christian minorities.

==Economy==

As of 2005, Talisay remains an important center for the production of blasting caps used in dynamite.

Much of the commerce in Talisay takes place in the Tabunok area, where several public markets, strip malls, and commercial establishments are situated. The biggest mall is Gaisano Grand Fiesta Mall Tabunok, which has a supermarket, department store, and formerly, a cinema. However, much of the population still depend on the public markets, where they can find fresh meat, fish and vegetables, as well as other household needs. There are many sari-sari stores. Talisay City and the Tabunok area also serve as the commercial area for municipalities south of the city, being the southern gateway to Cebu City.
==Culture==

Talisay City is considered the &quot;Lechon Capital of Cebu&quot; and is considered one of the two places to get the best of the best Lechon, which is nicknamed &quot;Inasal&quot;, in Cebu, with the other place being Carcar.

Because of their Lechon, the town decided to create a religious-cultural festival to promote Talisay City, which was &quot;Halad Inasal Festival&quot; and celebrated on October 15. The festival is in honor of St. Teresa of Avila, Talisay City&#x27;s patron saint, and is highlighted by street dancing merged with a procession with roasted pig, which then culminates with a ritual showdown and a grand finale with a firework display.

==Transport==
Talisay City has benefited from the construction of the South Road Properties and the road that traverses it, the Cebu South Coastal Road, which is a six-lane coastal highway from downtown Cebu City to the city&#x27;s Barangay Lawa-an I, near its border with the town of Minglanilla, with several exits in between, many of which serve several areas of Talisay. Because of this highway, traffic, which has always been a problem for the inhabitants in the past few years for this area, has been greatly reduced, making the city a popular zone for housing once more, as it was in the early 70s and 80s.

The city is also set to be served by the Cebu Bus Rapid Transit, wherein it will have two (2) feeder lines, going to Mambaling and to the South Road Properties, both located in Cebu City.

In 2016, the Talisay city council expressed support for the proposed Light Rail Transit (LRT) project in Cebu.

<doc id="590177" wikidata="Q1056732" url="?curid=590177" title="Ordinary language philosophy">
<text>Ordinary language philosophy (OLP) is a philosophical methodology that sees traditional philosophical problems as rooted in misunderstandings philosophers develop by distorting or forgetting how words are ordinarily used to convey meaning in non-philosophical contexts. &quot;Such &#x27;philosophical&#x27; uses of language, on this view, create the very philosophical problems they are employed to solve.&quot;

This approach typically involves eschewing philosophical &quot;theories&quot; in favor of close attention to the details of the use of everyday &quot;ordinary&quot; language. Its earliest forms are associated with the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and a number of mid-20th century philosophers who can be split into two main groups, neither of which could be described as an organized &quot;school&quot;. In its earlier stages, contemporaries of Wittgenstein at Cambridge University such as Norman Malcolm, Alice Ambrose, Friedrich Waismann, Oets Kolk Bouwsma and Morris Lazerowitz started to develop ideas recognisable as ordinary language philosophy. These ideas were further elaborated from 1945 onwards through the work of some Oxford University philosophers led initially by Gilbert Ryle, then followed by J. L. Austin and Paul Grice. This Oxford group also included H. L. A. Hart, Geoffrey Warnock, J. O. Urmson and P. F. Strawson. The close association between ordinary language philosophy and these later thinkers has led to it sometimes being called &quot;Oxford philosophy&quot;. The posthumous publication of Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot; in 1953 further solidified the notion of ordinary language philosophy. Philosophers a generation after Austin who made use of the method of ordinary language philosophy include Antony Flew, Stanley Cavell, John Searle and Oswald Hanfling. Today, Alice Crary, Nancy Bauer, Sandra Laugier, as well as literary theorists Toril Moi, Rita Felski, and Shoshana Felman have adopted the teachings of Cavell in particular, generating a resurgence of interest in ordinary language philosophy.

== Central ideas ==

The later Wittgenstein held that the meanings of words reside in their ordinary uses and that this is why philosophers trip over words taken in abstraction. From this came the idea that philosophy had gotten into trouble by trying to use words outside of the context of their use in ordinary language. For example, &quot;understanding&quot; is what you mean when you say &quot;I understand&quot;. &quot;Knowledge&quot; is what you mean when you say &quot;I know&quot;. The point is that you &quot;already know&quot; what &quot;understanding&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot; are, at least implicitly. Philosophers are ill-advised to construct new definitions of these terms, because this is necessarily a &quot;re&quot;definition, and the argument may unravel into self-referential nonsense. Rather, philosophers must explore the definitions these terms already have, without forcing convenient redefinitions onto them.

The controversy really begins when ordinary language philosophers apply the same leveling tendency to questions such as &quot;What is Truth?&quot; or &quot;What is Consciousness?&quot; Philosophers in this school would insist that we cannot assume that (for example) truth &#x27;is&#x27; a &#x27;thing&#x27; (in the same sense that tables and chairs are &#x27;things&#x27;) that the word &#x27;truth&#x27; represents. Instead, we must look at the differing ways in which the words &#x27;truth&#x27; and &#x27;conscious&#x27; actually function in ordinary language. We may well discover, after investigation, that there is no single entity to which the word &#x27;truth&#x27; corresponds, something Wittgenstein attempts to get across via his concept of a &#x27;family resemblance&#x27; (cf. &quot;Philosophical Investigations&quot;). Therefore, ordinary language philosophers tend to be anti-essentialist.

== History ==

Early analytic philosophy had a less positive view of ordinary language. Bertrand Russell tended to dismiss language as being of little philosophical significance, and ordinary language as just too confused to help solve metaphysical and epistemological problems. Gottlob Frege, the Vienna Circle (especially Rudolf Carnap), the young Wittgenstein, and W. V. O. Quine all attempted to improve upon it, in particular using the resources of modern logic. In his &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot; Wittgenstein more or less agreed with Russell that language ought to be reformulated so as to be unambiguous, so as to accurately represent the world, so that we can better deal with philosophical questions.

By contrast, Wittgenstein later described his task as bringing &quot;words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use&quot;. The sea change brought on by his unpublished work in the 1930s centered largely on the idea that there is nothing &quot;wrong&quot; with ordinary language as it stands, and that many traditional philosophical problems are only illusions brought on by misunderstandings about language and related subjects. The former idea led to rejecting the approaches of earlier analytic philosophy—arguably, of any earlier philosophy—and the latter led to replacing them with careful attention to language in its normal use, in order to &quot;dissolve&quot; the appearance of philosophical problems, rather than attempt to solve them. At its inception, ordinary language philosophy (also called linguistic philosophy) was taken as either an extension of or as an alternative to analytic philosophy.

Ordinary language analysis largely flourished and developed at Oxford University in the 1940s, under Austin and Ryle, and was quite widespread for a time before declining rapidly in popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Despite this decline, Stanley Cavell and John Searle (both students of Austin) published seminal texts which draw significantly from the ordinary language tradition in 1969. Cavell more explicitly adopted the banner of ordinary language philosophy and inspired a generation of philosophers and literary theorists to reexamine the merits of this philosophical approach, all the while distancing himself from the limitations of traditional analytic philosophy. This caused a relatively recent resurgence of interest in this methodology, with some updates particularly due to the literature and teachings of Cavell, has also become a mainstay of what might be called postanalytic philosophy. Seeking to avoid the increasingly metaphysical and abstruse language found in mainstream analytic philosophy, posthumanism, and post-structuralism, a number of feminist philosophers have adopted the methods of ordinary language philosophy. Many of these philosophers were students or colleagues of Cavell.

There are some affinities between contemporary ordinary language philosophy and philosophical pragmatism (or neopragmatism). Interestingly, the pragmatist philosopher F. C. S. Schiller might be seen as a forerunner to ordinary language philosophy, especially in his noted publication &quot;Riddles of the Sphinx&quot;.

Seneca the Younger described the activities of other philosophers in ways that reflect some of the same concerns as ordinary language philosophers.

 For these men, too, have left to us, not positive discoveries, but problems whose solution is still to be sought. They might perhaps have discovered the essentials, had they not sought the superfluous also. They lost much time in quibbling about words and in sophistical argumentation; all that sort of thing exercises the wit to no purpose. We tie knots and bind up words in double meanings, and then try to untie them. Have we leisure enough for this? Do we already know how to live, or die? We should rather proceed with our whole souls towards the point where it is our duty to take heed lest things, as well as words, deceive us. Why, pray, do you discriminate between similar words, when nobody is ever deceived by them except during the discussion? It is things that lead us astray: it is between things that you must discriminate.

== Criticism ==

One of the most ardent critics of ordinary language philosophy was a student at Oxford (and later a philosopher himself), Ernest Gellner, who said:
Gellner criticized ordinary language philosophy in his book &quot;Words and Things&quot; published in 1959.

<text>Manchild is a British television comedy/drama series that ran for two series on BBC Two between February 2002 and April 2003 with seven episodes in Series 1 and eight episodes in Series 2. It was created and written by Nick Fisher.

==Premise==
The show starred Ray Burdis (Gary), Nigel Havers (Terry), Anthony Head (James) and Don Warrington (Patrick) as four successful fifty-something men dealing with different problems such as marriage and children or life after divorce, aging parents, sexual dysfunction, lost youth, a succession of (younger) girlfriends, and the problems of how to enjoy the wealth and success they worked so hard to achieve.

==Reception==
Upon the series&#x27; late 2002 debut on BBC America, &quot;The New York Times&quot; review stated &quot;Classy and clever as the show is, its sadistic core makes it awfully hard to like&quot;, the show is &quot;a dry martini made with toxic acid in place of the vermouth. You may find yourself neither shaken nor stirred&quot;, and, in describing one character&#x27;s self-obsession, &quot;his wife is well rid of this clod. Quickly, you will be, too.&quot;.

==Releases==
The first series was released on DVD and VHS in March 2003.

==U.S. version==
An American pilot of the series was produced by Showtime, starring James Purefoy, Kevin Smith, John Corbett and Paul Hipp. The pilot made significant changes to the characters and premise as it moved the setting from London to Los Angeles.

<text>is an American-Japanese cyber security software company. The company has globally dispersed R&amp;D in 16 locations across every continent excluding Antarctica. The company develops enterprise security software for servers, containers, and cloud computing environments, networks, and end points. Its cloud and virtualization security products provide automated security for customers of VMware, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

Eva Chen is a co-founder, and chief executive officer since 2005. She succeeded founding CEO Steve Chang, who now is chairman.

==History==
===1988–1999===
The company was founded in 1988 in Los Angeles by Steve Chang, his wife, Jenny Chang, and her sister, Eva Chen (陳怡樺). The company was established with proceeds from Steve Chang&#x27;s previous sale of a copy protection dongle to a United States–based Rainbow Technologies. Shortly after establishing the company, its founders moved headquarters to Taipei.

In 1992, Trend Micro took over a Japanese software firm to form Trend Micro Devices and established headquarters in Tokyo. It then made an agreement with CPU maker Intel, under which it produced an anti-virus product for local area networks (LANs) for sale under the Intel brand. Intel paid royalties to Trend Micro for sales of LANDesk Virus Protect in the United States and Europe, while Trend paid royalties to Intel for sales in Asia. In 1993, Novell began bundling the product with its network operating system. In 1996, the two companies agreed to a two-year continuation of the agreement in which Trend was allowed to globally market the ServerProtect product under its own brand alongside Intel&#x27;s LANDesk brand.

Trend Micro was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1998 under the ticker 4704. The company began trading on the United States–based NASDAQ stock exchange in July 1999.

===2000s===
In 2004, founding chief executive officer Steve Chang decided to split the responsibilities of CEO and chairman of the company. Company co-founder Eva Chen succeeded Chang as chief executive officer of Trend Micro in January 2005. Chen has been the company&#x27;s chief technology officer since 1996 and before that executive vice president since the company&#x27;s founding in October 1989. Chang retained his position as company chairman. In May, Trend Micro acquired US-based antispyware company InterMute for $15 million. Trend Micro had fully integrated InterMute&#x27;s SpySubtract antispyware program into its antispyware product offerings by the end of that year. 

In June 2005 Trend Micro acquired Kelkea, a US-based developer of antispam software. Kelkea developed Mail Abuse Prevention System (MAPS) and IP filtering software that allowed internet service providers to block spam and phishing scams. Kelkea chief executive officer Dave Rand was retained by Trend Micro as its chief technologist for content security.

In March 2007, Trend Micro acquired freeware antispyware program HijackThis from its creator Merijn Bellekom for an undisclosed sum. Trend Micro delisted its depository shares from the NASDAQ stock exchange in May. Later that year, in October, Trend Micro acquired US-based data loss prevention software developer Provilla. Provilla was the creator of LeakProof, software that allowed companies to block the transmission of sensitive data and warn security managers about transmission attempts.

Trend Micro acquired Identum in February 2008 for an undisclosed sum. Identum, which was founded in and later spun-off from the University of Bristol cryptography department, developed ID-based email encryption software. Identum&#x27;s chairman was serial entrepreneur, Steve Purdham. The two companies were originally in talks for Trend Micro to license Identum&#x27;s technology, but Trend Micro later decided to purchase the firm outright. Identum was renamed Trend Micro (Bristol) and its encryption technology was integrated into existing Trend Micro products. Existing Identum products were continued but sold under the Trend Micro brand. Also that year, Trend Micro sued Barracuda Networks for the latter&#x27;s distribution of ClamAV as part of a security package. Trend Micro claimed that Barracuda&#x27;s use of ClamAV infringed on a software patent owned by Trend Micro for filtering viruses on an Internet gateway. On 19 May 2011, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Final Rejection in the reexamination of Trend Micro&#x27;s U.S. patent 5,623,600.

In April 2009, Trend Micro acquired Ottawa, Canada–based Third Brigade for an undisclosed sum. Third Brigade developed host-based intrusion prevention and firewall software that had been used by Trend Micro in its Trend OfficeScan anti-malware suite for two years prior to acquiring Third Brigade. Third Brigade was reincorporated as Trend Micro Canada Technologies.

===2010s===
Trend Micro acquired UK-based humyo in June 2010 for an undisclosed sum. humyo provided cloud-based data storage and synchronization services to small businesses and individuals. Later that year, in November, Trend Micro acquired Mobile Armor. Mobile Armor was a developer of full disk, file and folder, and removable media encryption for mobile devices. Trend Micro integrated the company&#x27;s technology into a centrally-managed platform for mobile device security.

In June 2012, Trend Micro acquired US-based Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate provider AffirmTrust for an undisclosed sum. Trend Micro followed up with another acquisition, Taiwanese advanced network-security firm Broadweb, in October 2012. Broadweb was a developer of deep packet inspection technology that had the ability to block malicious data packets in real-time. The technology was integrated into Trend Micro&#x27;s Custom Defense Solution, a suite that was designed to provide network-wide visibility and protection against advanced attacks and threats.

Trend Micro relocated its US headquarters to the Las Colinas area of Irving, Texas in September 2013. The relocation allowed the company to consolidate operations previously housed in Cupertino, California and Arlington, Texas.

In September 2014, Trend Micro began a partnership with INTERPOL wherein Trend Micro shared with the international police organization information on cybercrime threats via the company&#x27;s Threat Intelligence Service. According to INTERPOL, the information helped the international police organization and its 190 member countries decrease cybercrime on a global scale. Trend Micro also provided a cybercrime investigation training program to INTERPOL.

Also in 2014, Trend Micro expanded its Cloud App Security to protect Microsoft Office 365 from threats not caught by native Microsoft Security. By 2016, the Cloud App Security software was expanded to cover Box, Dropbox and Google Drive.

In October 2015, Trend Micro reached an agreement to buy TippingPoint, a network and software security developer from HP Inc. for $US300 million. This included the bug bounty program, the Zero Day Initiative which was incorporated in Trend Micro Research&#x27;s focus on existing threats, vulnerabilities, and future potential security issues.

That same year, Trend Micro was certified as a VCE validation ready solution and Vblock ready through the VCE Technology Alliance Partner program. Later, Trend Micro joined the VCE Select Program, which allowed Trend Micro&#x27;s Deep Security to be bundled with VCE&#x27;s converged and hyper-converged infrastructure systems.

Trend announced the launch of a $US100 million venture capital investment fund in June 2017 focused on the next generation of technology including the Internet of Things (IoT). In September 2017, Trend Micro was awarded reimbursement through the U.S. District Court for a portion of the legal fees incurred over rejected patent claims filed by Intellectual Ventures. The company subsequently launched Trend Forward Capital. The venture&#x27;s initial investments included business-to-business payment company Veem, wearable device company Muse, telemetry company Mojio and brain health technology company Interaxon.

In November 2017, Trend Micro acquired IMMUNIO, adding new capabilities for hybrid cloud security that fit neatly into the DevOps life cycle. IMMUNIO introduced early detection and protection against application vulnerabilities and container image scanning allowing for the publishing and protection of secure container images.

In December 2017, Trend partnered with Telco Systems to develop a virtual network cybersecurity platform combining Trend&#x27;s Virtual Network Function Suite with Telco&#x27;s NFVTime software.

In April 2018, Trend Micro joined the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, a public agreement between companies to defend all customers from malicious attacks by cybercriminal gangs and nation states.

In August 2018, researchers discovered that several Trend Micro consumer products for MacOS were capturing browser history and other data, including passwords, and sending it to a remote server for initial analysis designed to enhance security. The products identified were Dr. Cleaner, Dr. Cleaner Pro, Dr. Antivirus, Dr. Unarchiver, Dr. Battery, Duplicate Finder and Open Any File. As a consequence, Apple removed the Trend Micro products from its Mac App Store. Trend Micro admitted that the products had captured and uploaded the data. It also apologized to its &quot;community for concern they might have felt&quot;, but went on to excuse the activity as being &quot;humbly the result of the use of common code libraries&quot;, and that, in any event, appropriation of users&#x27; data was &quot;explicitly disclosed in the applicable EULAs&quot;.

In September 2018 Trend Micro and HITRUST announced a partnership to launch a new center which provides advanced cyber risk management. In October 2018, Trend Micro launched Apex One Endpoint Security, a single agent Endpoint Security product, stemming from the company&#x27;s past endpoint security products.

<text>Carl Joachim Friedrich Ludwig von Arnim (26 January 1781 – 21 January 1831), better known as Achim von Arnim, was a German poet, novelist, and together with Clemens Brentano and Joseph von Eichendorff, a leading figure of German Romanticism.

==Life==
Arnim was born in Berlin, descending from a Brandenburgian &quot;Uradel&quot; noble family first mentioned in 1204. His father was the Prussian chamberlain (&quot;Kammerherr&quot;) Joachim Erdmann von Arnim (1741–1804), royal envoy in Copenhagen and Dresden, later active as the director of the Berlin Court Opera. His mother, Amalia Caroline von Labes (1761–1781), died three weeks after Arnim&#x27;s birth.

Arnim and his elder brother Carl Otto spent their childhood with their maternal grandmother Marie Elisabeth von Labes, the widow of Michael Gabriel Fredersdorf from her first marriage, in Zernikow and in Berlin, where he attended the Joachimsthal Gymnasium. In 1798 he went on to study law, natural science and mathematics at the University of Halle. His early writings included numerous articles for scientific magazines. His first major work, &quot;Theorie der elektrischen Erscheinungen&quot; (Theory of electrical phenomena) showed a leaning to the supernatural, common among the German romanticists. In Halle he associated with the composer Johann Friedrich Reichardt, in whose house he became acquainted with the Romantic poet Ludwig Tieck. From 1800 he continued his studies at the University of Göttingen, though, having met Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Clemens Brentano, he inclined from natural sciences towards literature. Arnim received the degree of a Doctor of Medicine in 1801, but never practiced.

He went on to travel through Europe with his brother from 1801 to 1804. He met his later wife Bettina in Frankfurt, travelled down the Rhine Valley together with Clemens Brentano, visited Germaine de Staël in Coppet, Friedrich Schlegel and his wife Dorothea in Paris, and continued his journey to London and Scotland.

Arnim was influenced by the earlier writings of Goethe and Herder, from which he learned to appreciate the beauties of German traditional legends and folk songs. Back in Germany, he began forming a collection of these and in 1805 first published the result, in collaboration with Clemens Brentano, under the title &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;. He went to see Goethe in Weimar, in order to edit the collection. In Frankfurt he met with the jurist Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the beginning of an enduring friendship.

Arnims&#x27;s editorial work was increasingly affected by the Napoleonic Wars. Upon the Prussian defeat in the 1806 Battle of Jena–Auerstedt, he followed the royal court to Königsberg, where he joined the circle of Prussian reformers around Baron vom Stein. In 1807 he moved back to Weimar and Kassel, where he visited the Brothers Grimm, and finally to Heidelberg. He and Brentano completed the second and third volume of their folk song collection and from 1808 together with Joseph Görres published the important romantic &quot;Zeitung für Einsiedler&quot; (Newspaper for Hermits) in Heidelberg in 1808. The Heidelberg Romanticist circle also included Tieck, Friedrich Schlegel, Jean Paul, Justinus Kerner, and Ludwig Uhland.

From 1809 Arnim again lived in Berlin, however, his plans to enter the Prussian civil service failed. In 1810 he affianced Brentano&#x27;s sister Bettina, who won wide recognition as a writer in her own right. They married on 11 March 1811; their daughter Gisela (one of seven children) became a writer as well. Shortly after their marriage the couple went on to visit Goethe in to Weimar, however, the reunion was overshadowed by a heated quarrel between Bettina and Goethe&#x27;s wife Christiane.

In Berlin, Achim worked on Heinrich von Kleist&#x27;s legacy and founded the patriotic &quot;Deutsche Tischgesellschaft&quot; association of Christian men. He remained connected with the Prussian patriots such as Adam Heinrich Müller and Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué and even commanded a &quot;Landsturm&quot; battalion during the German Campaign of 1813. From October 1813 he acted as publisher of the Berlin newspaper &quot;The Prussian Correspondent&quot;, until he fell out with his predecessor Barthold Georg Niebuhr in February 1814.

While his wife stayed in Berlin, Arnim in 1814 retired to Künstlerhaus Schloss Wiepersdorf, his family home, where he lived until his death from a stroke in 1831. His output, published in newspapers, magazines and almanacs as well as self-contained books, included novels, dramas, stories, poems and journalistic works. Following his death, his library was taken over by the Weimar court library.

==Works==
Arnim is considered one of the most important representatives of German Romanticism. His works were collected, with an introduction by Wilhelm Grimm, in twenty volumes (1839–48). Heinrich Heine wrote a eulogy of Arnim in his &quot;Deutschland&quot;. His works include:

<text>Robert Rathbun Wilson (March 4, 1914 – January 16, 2000) was an American physicist known for his work on the Manhattan Project during World War II, as a sculptor, and as an architect of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), where he was the first director from 1967 to 1978.

A graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, Wilson received his doctorate under the supervision of Ernest Lawrence for his work on the development of the cyclotron at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. He subsequently went to Princeton University to work with Henry DeWolf Smyth on electromagnetic separation of the isotopes of uranium. In 1943, Wilson and many of his colleagues joined the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory, where Wilson became the head of its Cyclotron Group (R-1), and later its Research (R) Division.

After the war, Wilson briefly joined the faculty of Harvard University as an associate professor, then went to Cornell University as professor of physics and the director of its new Laboratory of Nuclear Studies. Wilson and his Cornell colleagues constructed four electron synchrotrons. In 1967 he assumed directorship of the National Accelerator Laboratory, subsequently known as Fermilab. He managed to complete the facility on time and under budget, but at the same time made it aesthetically pleasing, with a main administrative building purposely reminiscent of the Beauvais Cathedral, and a restored prairie with a herd of American Bison. He resigned in 1978 in a protest against inadequate government funding.

== Early life ==
Robert Rathbun Wilson was born in Frontier, Wyoming, in 1914, the son of Platt Elvin and Edith Elizabeth (Rathbun) Wilson. He had an older sister, Mary Jane. His parents separated when he was eight years old, and custody was awarded to his father, although he lived with his mother from time to time. Much of his early life was spent on cattle ranches. He changed schools frequently, and attended a number of schools, including the Todd School in Woodstock, Illinois, where his grandmother worked.

Wilson entered the University of California, Berkeley, in 1932, and was awarded his Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1936. He joined Ernest O. Lawrence&#x27;s Radiation Laboratory, which was at that time blossoming into the top American site for both experimental and theoretical physics due to the efforts of Lawrence and J. Robert Oppenheimer, respectively. Wilson received his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in 1940 for his thesis on &quot;Theory of the Cyclotron&quot;. That year he married Jane Inez Scheyer.

Wilson ran into trouble with Lawrence&#x27;s harsh frugality while working on his cyclotron and was fired twice from the Radiation Laboratory. The first time was for losing a rubber seal in the 37-inch cyclotron which prevented its use in a demonstration to a potential donor. He was later rehired at Luis Alvarez&#x27;s urging, but melted an expensive pair of pliers while welding, and was fired again. Though offered his job back, he decided instead to go to Princeton University to work with Henry DeWolf Smyth.

== Manhattan Project ==
At Princeton, Wilson eventually took over Smyth&#x27;s project of the development of an alternative approach to electromagnetic separation from Lawrence&#x27;s calutron method, used for the purpose of separating the fissile uranium-235 isotope of uranium from the much more common uranium-238, which is a key step to producing an atomic bomb. By 1941 the project had produced a device called the &quot;isotron,&quot; which, unlike the calutron, used an electrical field to separate the uranium instead of a magnetic one.
The work at Princeton was terminated during World War II when Oppenheimer&#x27;s secret laboratory for research on the atomic bomb, the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos National Laboratory, opened in 1943. &quot;Like a bunch of professional soldiers,&quot; Wilson later recalled, &quot;we signed up, en masse, to go to Los Alamos.&quot;

Wilson moved there with some of his Princeton staff and Harvard University&#x27;s cyclotron, and was appointed as head of the Cyclotron Group (R-1) by Oppenheimer. Only in his late twenties, he was the youngest group leader in the experimental division. The cyclotron would be used for measurements of the neutron cross section of plutonium.

When Oppenheimer reorganized the laboratory in August 1944 to focus on the development of an implosion-type nuclear weapon, Wilson became head of R (Research) Division. As such he had four groups reporting to him: the Cyclotron Group (R-1), still headed by himself; the Electrostatic Group (R-2), headed by John H. Williams; the D-D (Deuterium-Deuterium) Group (R-3), headed by John H. Manley; and the Radioactivity Group (R-4), headed by Emilio G. Segrè. In March 1945, R Division acquired the additional responsibility of developing instrumentation for the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. Wilson helped stack boxes of explosives for the 100-ton test that preceded it. At Los Alamos, he was also active in community affairs, serving on the town council.

In May 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered, and the initial motivation for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as it was discovered that the German nuclear energy project was years behind, Wilson raised the question of whether they should continue with their work. News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary &quot;The Day After Trinity&quot; (1980), Wilson would say that he should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted not doing so to some extent. Richard Feynman recalled seeing Wilson sitting and moping on the morning right after the Trinity test as everyone celebrated and had parties. When asked why, Wilson told Feynman, &quot;It&#x27;s a terrible thing that we made.&quot;

After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Wilson helped organize the Association of Los Alamos Scientists (ALAS), which called, with a scientists&#x27; petition, for the international control of atomic energy. The petition was carried by Oppenheimer to Washington, D.C., eventually making its way via Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to President Harry S. Truman.

== Post-World War II ==

After the war, Wilson also helped form the Federation of American Scientists and served as its chairman in 1946. He accepted an appointment as an associate professor at Harvard, but spent the first eight months of 1946 at Berkeley designing a new 150 MeV cyclotron for Harvard to replace the one taken to Los Alamos. At Harvard, Wilson published a seminal paper, &quot;Radiological Use of Fast Protons&quot;, which founded the field of proton therapy.

=== Cornell ===

In 1947 Wilson went to Cornell University as professor of physics and the director of its new Laboratory of Nuclear Studies. At Cornell, Wilson and his colleagues constructed four electron synchrotrons. The first, a 300 MeV synchrotron, was under construction when he arrived. In a 1948 report to the Office of Naval Research, he described their purpose:

Wilson initiated the construction of a 1.4 GeV synchrotron in 1952. As he had foreseen in 1948, it produced artificial K mesons and rho mesons, and tested quantum electrodynamics at short distances. The last machine he built at Cornell was a 12 GeV synchrotron that remains in use as an injector for the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR), built between 1977 and 1999. It is located in what is now known as the Wilson Synchrotron Laboratory.

Wilson was one of the first physicists to use Monte Carlo methods, which he used to model electron and proton initiated particle showers. He invented the quantometer so that he could measure the intensity of high-energy X-ray beams.

=== Fermilab ===

In 1967 he took a leave of absence from Cornell to assume directorship of the nascent National Accelerator Laboratory at Batavia, Illinois, which was to be the largest particle accelerator constructed until then (it was to remain so until the beginning of operation of the Large Electron-Positron Collider at CERN in 1989). In 1969, Wilson was called to justify the multimillion-dollar machine to the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Bucking the trend of the day, Wilson emphasized it had nothing at all to do with national security, rather:
Thanks to Wilson&#x27;s talented leadership, a management style very much adopted from Lawrence, the facility was completed on time and under budget. According to Wilson, he gave Atomic Energy Commission chairman Glenn T. Seaborg his assurance &quot;signed in blood&quot; that he would not exceed the authorized $250 million budget and &quot;would rot in Hell&quot; if he did. The facility centered on a four-mile circumference, 400 GeV accelerator. Wilson subsequently initiated the design of the Tevatron, a 1 TeV particle accelerator. The National Accelerator Laboratory, was renamed the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in 1974, after Enrico Fermi. It is frequently referred to as &quot;Fermilab&quot;.
Wilson had studied sculpture at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze in Italy while on sabbatical in 1961, and he wanted Fermilab to be an appealing place to work, believing that external harmony would encourage internal harmony as well, and labored personally to keep it from looking like a stereotypical &quot;government lab&quot;, playing a key role in its design and architecture. Surrounding the facility was a restored prairie which served as a home to a herd of American Bison that started with Wilson bringing in a bull and four cows in 1969.

The site also had ponds, and a main building purposely reminiscent of the Beauvais Cathedral. Fermilab also celebrates his role as a sculptor, featuring several of his works, including &quot;The Mobius Strip&quot;, &quot;The Hyperbolic Obelisk&quot;, &quot;Tractricious&quot;, and &quot;Broken Symmetry&quot;. Another metal sculpture &quot;Topological III&quot; sits in the lobby of the Harvard Science Center. Fermilab&#x27;s Central Laboratory building was named Robert Rathbun Wilson Hall in his honor in 1980.

Wilson served as the director of Fermilab until 1978, when he resigned in protest against what he considered was inadequate funding by the Federal government. He then joined the faculty of the University of Chicago as Ritzma Professor at the Enrico Fermi Institute. He became emeritus professor of physics at Chicago in 1980. He moved to Columbia University, where he became I. I. Rabi Visiting Professor of Science and Human Relations in 1979, Michael I. Pupin Professor of Physics in 1980, and emeritus professor in 1982. He retired in 1983 and moved back to Ithaca, NY.
== Awards and honors ==
Wilson received many awards and honors, including the Elliott Cresson Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1964, the National Medal of Science in 1973, and the Department of Energy&#x27;s Enrico Fermi Award in 1984. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society, and was president of the American Physical Society in 1985. In 1986, Wilson received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

== Death ==
Wilson suffered a stroke in 1999, from which he never recovered. He died on January 16, 2000, at the age of 85, at a nursing home in Ithaca, New York, and was buried at the 19th-century Pioneer Cemetery (established 1839) on the Fermilab site on Batavia Road near Fermilab Site 39. He was survived by his wife, Jane; his three sons, Daniel, Jonathan and Rand; and his sister, Mary Jane Greenhill. His papers are in the Cornell University Library.

<doc id="590224" wikidata="Q2073365" url="?curid=590224" title="List of compositions by Dmitri Shostakovich">
<text>Dmitri Shostakovich typically catalogued his compositions and occasionally his arrangements of other composers&#x27; music with opus numbers. He began this practice with the early Scherzo in F-sharp minor and continued until the end of his life. Nevertheless, most of his juvenilia, unfinished works from his artistic maturity (such as the operas &quot;Orango&quot; and &quot;The Gamblers&quot;), and numerous completed works were left unnumbered. There were also instances when Shostakovich took an opus number assigned to one work, then gave it to another, or was undecided about the numbering of a finished composition. Further complicating the matter was an error he committed in compiling his own music in the 1930s. This led to his soundtracks for &quot;The Youth of Maxim&quot; and &quot;Girl Friends&quot; sharing the same opus number.

<text>ESET, s.r.o., is a software company specializing in cybersecurity, founded in 1992 in Bratislava, Slovakia. ESET&#x27;s security products are made in Europe and provides security software in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. Its software is localized into more than 30 languages.

The origins of the company date back to 1987, when two of the company&#x27;s founders, Miroslav Trnka and Peter Paško, developed their first antivirus program called NOD. This sparked an idea between friends to help protect PC users and soon grew into an antivirus software company. At present, ESET is recognized as Europe&#x27;s biggest privately held cybersecurity company.

== History ==
;1987–1992
The product NOD was launched in Czechoslovakia when the country was part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s sphere of influence. Under the communist regime, private entrepreneurship was banned. It wasn&#x27;t until 1992 when Miroslav Trnka and Peter Paško, together with Rudolf Hrubý, established ESET as a privately owned limited liability company in the former Czechoslovakia. In parallel with NOD, the company also started developing Perspekt. They adopted the name ESET, from the Czech name of Isis, the Egyptian goddess of health, marriage and love, as the company name.

;2003–2017
In 2013, ESET launched WeLiveSecurity, a blog site dedicated to a vast spectrum of security-related topics.

December 2017 marked the 30th anniversary of the company&#x27;s first security product. To mark its accomplishments, the company released a short documentary describing the company&#x27;s evolution from the perspective of founders Miroslav Trnka and Peter Paško. In the same year, the company partnered with Google to integrate its technology into Chrome Cleanup.

;2018–present
In December 2018, ESET partnered with No More Ransom, a global initiative that provides victims of ransomware decryption keys, thus removing the pressure to pay attackers. The initiative is supported by Interpol and has been joined by various national police forces. ESET has developed technologies to address the threat of ransomware and has produced papers documenting its evolution.

ESET became a founding member of Google&#x27;s App Defense Alliance.

== Products ==
ESET provides security products for home and business users. Its products cover all the main operating systems across server, cloud, and mobile deployments.

ESET&#x27;s first product was NOD, an antivirus program for computers running the MS-DOS operating system. NOD32 1.0 for Microsoft Windows was released in 1998 and version 2.0 in 2003. A third version, ESET NOD32 Antivirus, followed in 2007 along with ESET Smart Security 3, which added antispam and firewall modules.

ESET NOD32 Antivirus and additional related products with a wider suite of security functions, including ESET Smart Security Premium and ESET Internet Security, are upgraded and released on an annual basis. In 2010, ESET released products for macOS, with a business version now called ESET Endpoint Antivirus and a home version called ESET Cyber Security.

ESET also offers products for Android devices. The first version of ESET Mobile Security was announced in 2012. The product offers malware protection and a call filter, an adware detector, payment protection, and theft protection (such as SIM card locking and total data wipes). In 2015, ESET introduced ESET Parental Control, which allows parents to monitor children&#x27;s use of Android devices.

ESET Smart TV Security, designed to protect Android TV from malware, phishing, and ransomware, was introduced in 2018 at the Mobile World Congress event in Barcelona.

The company offers products to protect corporate data, ranging from workstation and server protection with ESET PROTECT Entry to endpoint detection and response with ESET Enterprise Inspector.

ESET also offers security products that help companies comply with GDPR requirements. These include ESET Secure Authentication, a two-factor authentication solution introduced in 2015, and ESET Endpoint Encryption, which ESET released in 2017 following the integration of DESlock+ products since 2015. ESET Endpoint Encryption offers file, folder, email, and virtual disk encryption, as well as a desktop shredder for secure file deletion.

Along with its individual products and packages, ESET offers services designed mainly for corporations and large companies. These include managed detection and response, premium support, security audits, and incident response.

== Technology ==
ESET has 13 R&amp;D centres globally and is an operator in the field of malicious code detection. In 1995, ESET introduced heuristic analysis into its detection engine.

ESET has been using machine learning in its products, starting with neural networks, since 1997. In 2005, ESET incorporated a machine learning-based technology called DNA Detections, which extracts selected features – called genes – from samples. These genes split samples into clean, malicious and potentially unwanted categories. In 2019, ESET released an Advanced Machine Learning detection layer that can analyze samples locally on endpoints even when offline.

In 2011, ESET replaced ThreatSense.NET with ESET LiveGrid®, a cloud-based reputation system that evaluates unknown or suspicious samples submitted anonymously by millions of ESET-protected endpoints from around the world for machine learning analysis on servers in Bratislava.

ESET also uses additional security layers including Botnet Protection, Network Attack Protection, Script-Based Attacks Protection, and Brute-Force Attack Protection.

In 2017, ESET became the first security company in the world to implement a UEFI Scanner. UEFI is a firmware that is loaded into a computer&#x27;s memory during the startup process. The scanner can identify threats while the computer is booting up, before standard detection modules start running.

== Malware research ==
ESET dedicates part of its operations to malware research, as well as to the monitoring of advanced persistent threat groups and other cybercriminal groups, with 40% of the company&#x27;s employees working in research.

One of the groups that ESET tracked is Sandworm. After the 2015 attack on the Ukrainian power grid and the global NotPetya ransomware attack in 2017 – both attributed to Sandworm – ESET discovered Sandworm (more specifically, a subgroup that ESET tracks as TeleBots) deploying a new backdoor called Exaramel, which is a version of the main Industroyer backdoor. As Industroyer was used in the 2016 blackout in Ukraine, ESET linked Industroyer to NotPetya, as well as to BlackEnergy, which was used in the 2015 blackout.

At the time of the NotPetya outbreak, ESET and Cisco tracked down the point from which the global ransomware attack had started to companies afflicted with a TeleBots backdoor, resulting from the compromise of M.E.Doc, a popular financial software in Ukraine.

In March 2021, when Microsoft released out-of-band patches to fix the ProxyLogon vulnerability affecting on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server, ESET discovered more than 10 APT groups leveraging the vulnerability to compromise them. ProxyLogon allows an attacker to take over any reachable Exchange server, even without knowing valid account credentials.

In addition, ESET found that multiple threat actors had access to the details of the vulnerabilities even before the release of the patches. Except for DLTMiner, which is linked to a known cryptomining campaign, all of these threat actors are APT groups interested in espionage: Tick, LuckyMouse, Calypso, Websiic, Winnti Group, Tonto Team, ShadowPad activity, The &quot;Opera&quot; Cobalt Strike, IIS backdoors, Mikroceen, DLTMiner, and FamousSparrow.

Another focus of ESET&#x27;s research is on threats to Android devices. ESET discovered the first clipper malware in the Google Play Store called Android/Clipper.C, which can manipulate clipboard content. In the case of a cryptocurrency transaction, a wallet address copied to the clipboard could be quietly switched to one belonging to the attacker.

In the area of IoT research, ESET discovered the KrØØk vulnerability (CVE-2019-15126) in Broadcom and Cypress Wi-Fi chips, which allows WPA2-encrypted traffic to be encrypted with an all zero session key following a Wi-Fi disassociation. Then ESET discovered another KrØØk related vulnerability (CVE-2020-3702) in chips by Qualcomm and MediaTek, as well as in the Microsoft Azure Sphere development kit, with the main difference being that the traffic is not encrypted at all.

Other notable research includes the discovery of LoJax, the first UEFI rootkit found in the wild, which was used in a campaign by the Sednit (aka Fancy Bear) APT group. LoJax is written to a system&#x27;s SPI flash memory from where it is able to survive an OS reinstall and a hard disk replacement. LoJax can drop and execute malware on disk during the boot process. In 2021, ESET discovered another UEFI malware called ESPecter, which is the second real-world bootkit after FinSpy known to persist on the EFI System Partition in the form of a patched Windows Boot Manager.

In 2021, ESET released the white paper &quot;Anatomy of native IIS malware&quot;, which analyzed over 80 unique samples of malicious native extensions for Internet Information Services (IIS) web server software used in the wild and categorized these into 14 malware families — 10 of which were previously undocumented.

Among these families, IIS malware demonstrated five main modes of operation:

* IIS backdoors, which can remotely control compromised computers;
* IIS infostealers, which steal information such as login credentials and payment information;
* IIS injectors, which modify HTTP responses sent to legitimate visitors to serve malicious content;
* IIS proxies, which use the compromised server as unwitting parts of the command and control infrastructure for another malware family; and
* SEO fraud IIS malware, which modifies the content served to search engines.

ESET also works alongside experts from competitors and police organizations all over the world to investigate attacks. In 2018, ESET partnered with the European Cybercrime Centre — a specialist Europol team that investigates cybercrime — as a member of its Advisory Group on Internet Security. ESET partnered with law enforcement agencies worldwide and Microsoft to target the Dorkbot botnet in 2015 and the Gamarue (aka Andromeda) botnet in 2017. Then in 2020, ESET partnered with Microsoft, Lumen&#x27;s Black Lotus Labs, and NTT Ltd. in an attempt to disrupt Trickbot, another botnet.

<text>Malá Strana (Czech for &quot;Little Side (of the River)&quot;, ) or historically Menší Město pražské () is a district of the city of Prague, Czech Republic, and one of its most historic neighbourhoods.

In the Middle Ages, it was a dominant center of the ethnic German (and since 16th century also Italian) citizens of Prague. It also housed many noble palaces while the right-bank towns were comparatively more bourgeois and more Bohemian Czech.

==Name==
The name Malá Strana literally means &quot;Little Side&quot;, though it is frequently referred to as &quot;Lesser Town&quot;, &quot;Lesser Quarter&quot;, or &quot;Lesser Side&quot;. It is on the left (west) bank of the river Vltava, on the slopes just below Prague Castle. The name distinguishes it from the larger districts of Prague on the right bank, with which it is linked by the Charles Bridge.

Originally, when it was founded in 1257, the district was called the &quot;New Town beneath Prague Castle&quot; (). When Charles IV founded the New Town of Prague in 1348, Malá Strana was renamed the &quot;Lesser Town of Prague&quot; (). In the 17th century, the unofficial name &quot;Little Quarter&quot; () was used.

==History==

Malá Strana was founded by the King Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1257. As a royal town (a town founded by the king) it got many privileges. It was created by amalgamating a number of settlements beneath the Prague Castle into a single administrative unit. The original residents were expelled and mostly German craftsmen and merchants were invited by the king. Even though the city was royal, the king did not master the city as a whole.

In the second half of the 14th century the Lesser Town of Prague was extended by the King and Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV who built a new defensive wall called Hunger Wall.

In 1419–1420 the Lesser Town was burnt down by Hussites. In 1541 the town was strongly damaged again by a fire which killed fifty people. After this fire the town was rebuilt in the Renaissance style and many palaces of nobility were built there.

The market place, now known as &quot;Malostranské náměstí&quot; (Lesser Town Square), was the center of the town. This square is divided into the upper and lower parts with the St. Nicholas Church in the middle.

== Demographics ==
==Architecture==

Baroque architecture predominates in Malá Strana, but the history of the district dates back to far before the Baroque era. Baroque architecture eventually dominated when the style was implanted on Malá Strana after the destructive fires in 1541.

==Points of interest==
*The most extensive building of the Baroque Era on Malá Strana is the Wallenstein Palace. Albrecht von Wallenstein was a military general-in-chief of Emperor Ferdinand II. Under his order 26 new houses and old gates were built on the freed place. The extensive palace complex with five courtyards and the garden, which is set as a French Park.
*The churches are the most frequent and interesting developments on Malá Strana. The finest one and the most prominent is the St. Nicholas Church. This is a masterpiece of Christoph and Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer, father and son. The finest painting in the church is an apotheosis of Saint Nicholas, the defender of children, seamen, and wayfollowers. This painting is set in the dome. It depicts an apotheosis of Saint Trinity.
* The famous statue of the Holy Infant Jesus of Prague is in the Church of Our Lady Victorious in Malá Strana. The devotion and the church drew millions of Roman Catholic faithful to Malá Strana throughout the years. 
* In 1989, the Prague Embassy of West Germany, in the Palais Lobkowicz, was the site of a drama involving thousands of East German refugees. Their cars were left behind in the quarter.
* The famous Czech novelist Jan Neruda was born, lived in and wrote about Malá Strana; Nerudova Street is named after him.
* The Petřín lookout tower is located in Malá Strana.
* The Czech composer Bohuslav Martinu lived in an apartment near Kampa Island in the Malá Strana while a conservatory student, and a plaque now commemorates his stay.

<doc id="590233" wikidata="Q993823" url="?curid=590233" title="Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)">
<text>Everything Must Go is the fourth studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released on 20 May 1996 by Epic Records. It was the first record released as a trio, following the disappearance of lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards.

Released at the height of Britpop in the mid-1990s, the album was a commercial and critical success, it reached its peak in the UK on separate occasions, debuting and peaking at number 2 in the UK Albums Chart and earned the band accolades in the 1997 Brit Awards. It represented a shift in the group&#x27;s sound due to Edwards&#x27; departure. The album charted in mainland Europe, Asia and Australia, eventually selling over two million copies. &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; is frequently featured and voted highly in lists for one of the best albums of all time by many music publications such as &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;.

== Production and content ==
Singer-songwriter James Dean Bradfield said that the sound of the drums was crucial on the album to set the tone. He was inspired by the works of several bands, &quot;I loved records like &quot;Pornography&quot; by The Cure and Joy Division records and Wire records and Magazine records and [Siouxsie and the] Banshees records and Wah! records and Associates records where everything starts with the drums&quot;. Producer Mike Hedges was the person the group had in mind since &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; in part for his production role on Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; single &quot;Swimming Horses&quot; of which Bradfield was a fan. The band stayed in Domfront en Poiraie, France, to work at Hedges&#x27; own studio which contained a mixing desk coming from the Abbey Road Studios.

===Music and lyrics===
The working title of the album was &quot;Sounds in the Grass&quot;, named after a series of paintings by Jackson Pollock. &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; takes its name from a play by Patrick Jones, Nicky Wire&#x27;s brother.

&quot;Everything Must Go&quot; represents a change of style for the band. Their previous album, &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;, had been a stark, disturbing album with a minimal amount of instrumentation, whilst this album embraces synths and strings with an anthemic rock style, has a more commercial feel and fits with the Britpop movement that was prevalent at the time. According to Wire, the concept of the album used as its sonic basis the productions of Phil Spector and his Wall of Sound.

The lyrical focus of the album is also shifted, due in part to Edwards&#x27; departure. Instead of introspective and autobiographical tracks such as &quot;4st 7lb&quot;, Wire&#x27;s predilection for historical and political themes dominates; however, five songs feature Edwards&#x27; lyrics – the last time his lyrics would feature in a Manics album until 2009&#x27;s &quot;Journal for Plague Lovers&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrical themes would continue through their next record, &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot;.

Subjects tackled on the album include the life of photographer Kevin Carter, in the song of the same name; Willem de Kooning in &quot;Interiors&quot;; and the maltreatment of animals in captivity in &quot;Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky&quot; (which is a quote from the film &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;). The latter track, with lyrics by Edwards, can also be interpreted as an exploration of his mental state before his disappearance; the line &quot;Here chewing your tail is joy&quot; for instance may be as much about Edwards&#x27;s self-harm as it is the tormented self-injury of zoo animals.

Part of the rhythm guitar on &quot;No Surface All Feeling&quot; was recorded by Edwards before his disappearance, making it only the second time that Edwards&#x27; guitar-work was present on a Manic Street Preachers recorded track (the other instance being &quot;La Tristesse Durera (Scream to a Sigh)&quot; on &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot;). Bradfield typically performs all the guitar parts for their recordings.

===Songs===

Due to Edwards&#x27; departure the tone of the lyrics and the subjects of the songs changed significantly. Wire stated about the aesthetic and the feel of the album, saying that: &quot;With &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;, in the way we talked about it, we were the most timid we&#x27;d ever been, because we were very nervous. It was strange because it was the most un-Manics we&#x27;ve been about in an album, and then it was the most successful.

====Elvis Impersonator: Blackpool Pier and Enola/Alone====
The opening song of the album, &quot;Elvis Impersonator: Blackpool Pier&quot;, has been described by the band as a song that reflects the way that the UK accepts the American culture and worships it. In the 10th anniversary edition, Bradfield stated that the song suited the mood of the album and reminds him of when Wire and Edwards used to write lyrics together. Being Edwards&#x27; work, Bradfield denies that this song or any other written by Edwards and featured on the album is a tribute to Edwards; he just thought that the lyrics suited the album well. In the band&#x27;s own words, &quot;Enola/Alone&quot; is both &quot;uplifting&quot; and &quot;melancholic&quot;, and that&#x27;s why people can &quot;grab on&quot; as Wire says. The lyrics are also inspired to some extent by &quot;Camera Lucida&quot;, a 1980 book on the philosophy of photography by Frenchman Roland Barthes.

====Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky and The Girl Who Wanted to Be God====
&quot;Small Black Flowers That Grow in the Sky&quot; is another lyric written by Edwards, this song is a favourite of the album&#x27;s producer Mike Hedges, it was also described by Bradfield as the song where he wanted for the first time to sing the lyrics and take a deep breath. It has been made a parallel between the lyrics and Edwards&#x27;s condition (see music and lyrics section). &quot;The Girl Who Wanted to Be God&quot; has a title which can be traced to a specific quote by American poet Sylvia Plath, it is the most anthemic and opened song in the album, featuring the most hopeful sound of the twelve tracks, according to the band.

====Removables and Interiors (Song for Willem de Kooning)====
Allegedly a one-take live studio recording that had very little time spent on it, &quot;Removables&quot; was another song whose lyrics were written by Edwards, it has once again a reference to his self-harm, like in the line &quot;broken hands never ending&quot;. &quot;Interiors&quot; is a tribute to Willem de Kooning, a painter who suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. It was inspired by a documentary on De Kooning&#x27;s experience of suffering the condition, which apparently left him unable to remember what he had painted.

====Further Away and No Surface All Feeling====
&quot;Further Away&quot; was the band&#x27;s moment of freedom, where Wire stated that this song could never have been written before in the early years, being described as &quot;almost&quot; a love song. It was released as a single only in Japan. The B-side, &quot;Sepia&quot;, is a reference to the final scene of &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, where the two main characters are shown in freeze frame, which then is colourised to sepia tone. As for &quot;No Surface All Feeling&quot; part of the guitar was recorded by Edwards, and Wire describes the lyrics as a tender end to the album, as the song reflects the pain of losing a friend.

== Release ==

The album was released on 20 May 1996. It debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 2 with sales of 60,000 copies. To date the album has achieved Triple Platinum status in the UK, making it their most successful chart album and spending 104 weeks in the Top 100, with the album still in the top five a year after its release. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry awarded the album with a Platinum certification, for sales above one million copies. The album presented the band with a new generation of fans, charting in Europe, Asia and Australia. Since May 1996 &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; has shipped more than two million copies. Worldwide sales of their next album, &quot;This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours&quot;, were to be even higher.

Four singles were released from the album. &quot;A Design for Life&quot; reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart, spending 3 weeks in the top 10 and a total of 14 weeks in the Top 100 being certified Silver in the UK, for sales above 200.000 copies. The title track was released as the second single, peaking at number 5 and enjoying 10 weeks in the UK Top 100. &quot;Kevin Carter&quot;, the third single, peaked at number 9, spending 8 weeks in the UK Top 100, being the single from the album that spent the least weeks in the charts because the last single, &quot;Australia&quot;, reached number 7 and despite tumbling to number 31 in the second sales week, managed to stay in the UK Singles Chart Top 100 for 9 weeks. All the singles thus charted in the UK Top 10, between 1996 and 1997. &quot;Further Away&quot; was released in October 1996, but only in Japan, replacing the UK single &quot;Kevin Carter&quot;.

After the release of the album, in the following year the band performed a special gig at the Manchester Arena for more than 20,000 people. Bassist Nicky Wire said that was the moment he knew that the band had &quot;made it&quot;. The recording was released as a VHS video on 29 September 1997, and has only been reissued on DVD in Japan. &quot;Everything Live&quot; was directed by Dick Carruthers. The first 12,000 copies came with five postcards featuring photographs of the band by their official photographer Mitch Ikeda.

A 10th anniversary edition of the album was released on 6 November 2006. It included the original album, demos, B-sides, remixes, rehearsals and alternate takes of the album&#x27;s songs, spread out over two CDs. An additional DVD, featuring music videos, live performances, TV appearances, a 45-minute documentary on the making of the album, and two films by Patrick Jones, completed the three-disc set. In the 10th anniversary edition the band itself claims that they are still fond of the record, and Wire goes further saying: &quot;I think it&#x27;s our best record, I am not afraid to say that.&quot;

The year of 2016 marked another anniversary for the album, being 20 years since its original release thus the band announced a special anniversary edition which was released on 20 May, the exact day that marked the anniversary of the album. It was made available a standard edition, with a double-CD featuring only the remastered album and the concert at the Nynex Arena and the deluxe edition which includes the full album remastered plus the B-sides, a heavyweight vinyl, the 1997 Nynex Arena concert fully restored on DVD, an exclusive new film about the making of the album, the official videos for the all singles and a 40-page booklet. The re-release was accompanied by a UK tour, which ended at the Liberty Stadium, Swansea.

On 18 June 2016 HMV, as part of their Vinyl Record Week, released 1,000 copies on blue vinyl. These were strictly limited to one per customer.

===Packaging===
The album and CD packaging was designed by Mark Farrow. The CD insert bears a quote from Jackson Pollock: &quot;The pictures I contemplate painting would constitute a halfway state and attempt to point out the direction of the future – without arriving there completely&quot;. Inspiration for the album is credited to &quot;Tower Colliery, Cynon Valley, South Wales&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Being the first album since the departure of Edwards, the band at the time was under pressure, but after the release of &quot;A Design for Life&quot;, which was well received by critics and fans, &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; was the album that introduced the band to the mainstream public. All the singles were radio friendly and the album was a critical success.

Writing for &quot;Q&quot; magazine in June 1996, Tom Doyle felt that &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; had &quot;little in common&quot; with its predecessor, &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;, and saw the album as a return to, and improvement upon, the &quot;epic pop-rock&quot; sound of &quot;Gold Against the Soul&quot;. He noted the band&#x27;s choice of producer, Mike Hedges, as a possible contributing factor to the overall change in sound, and drew parallels to the lyrics of Kurt Cobain and the &quot;reverb-laden&quot; music of Phil Spector. Nicholas Barber of &quot;The Independent&quot; described &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; as &quot;the most immediate, assured and anthemic British hard rock album since Oasis&#x27;s &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;&quot;, noting that the record was more accessible when comparing it to the &quot;crushingly heavy-going&quot; sound of &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;, especially, he noted, for a band &quot;who once would have spat at the breadhead, corporate-sell-out idea of a hummable ditty.&quot;

&quot;Vox&quot; magazine&#x27;s Mark Sutherland saw &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; as the group&#x27;s &quot;most approachable&quot; album, describing it as a &quot;record so superb it might just make intelligence fashionable again&quot;, and surmising that the album &quot;proves that, professionally, at least, the Manic Street Preachers don&#x27;t miss Richey.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic David Fricke called &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; the &quot;most underrated album of the year&quot;, describing it as &quot;a record of painstaking melodic craft and thundering execution, a proclamation of physical and emotional cleansing – up to a point.&quot;

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: &quot;Above all, &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; is a cathartic experience – it is genuinely moving to hear the Manics offering hope without sinking to mawkish sentimentality or collapsing under the weight of their situation.&quot; 
Reviewing the 10th anniversary edition, Dave Simpson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the album &quot;achieved the zenith of the Welshmen&#x27;s original ambition: to conquer the mainstream with anger, art and soul.&quot; Writing for Sputnikmusic, Nick Butler concluded that &quot;&quot;Everything Must Go&quot; is a stellar album, stuffed with great, anthemic songs, and it&#x27;s a rewarding listening experience. It loses ground to &quot;The Holy Bible&quot; simply because it&#x27;s not as unique, but if &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; is inferior, it&#x27;s only slightly so.&quot;

=== Awards ===
The album was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize in 1996 but failed to win it; however, the album won the award for Best British Album and the Manic Street Preachers won Best British Group at the 1997 Brit Awards. In the NME Awards of 1996 &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; was named Album of the Year, and the Manic Street Preachers also won the award for Best Live Act and Best Single for &quot;A Design for Life&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The album remains a critical success, an important album in Manic Street Preachers&#x27; career, and a classic of the British music in the 1990s, being frequently listed amongst the greatest albums ever by British music publications.

In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted it the 11th greatest album of all time, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 39 in its list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. The album also placed at number 16 in its list of the best albums released in the magazine&#x27;s lifetime. The album is part of &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s collection of classic albums, and the same magazine placed the album in number 182 on their definitive list &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; placed the album in number 24 on their list of &quot;100 Best British Rock Albums Ever&quot;. The same magazine featured the album in number 22 on their list of &quot;100 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The album was placed in number 41 on &quot;Melody Maker&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;All Time Top 100 Albums&quot;. In 2016 the album was featured in the Absolute Radio&#x27;s list of greatest albums of all time.

In the end-of-year critics&#x27; lists &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; was placed at number 2 by &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; while &quot;Q&quot; chose the album as one of the best of 1996. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Vox&quot; magazine placed the album at number 1 in their 1996&#x27;s list.

The album and was featured in Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Website Clash, before the release of the band&#x27;s twelfth studio album &quot;Futurology&quot;, said the following about &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;: &quot;Sympathetically guided by Mike Hedges and with an empathetic but not overbearing application of strings, &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; managed to combine the more accessible sound of their early years with the vivid imagery of their previous album. Somehow lumped into the latter stages of Britpop at the time, this record remains one of the decade&#x27;s finest releases and is an essential listen.&quot;

In 2015 the band announced that they were going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album with their biggest headline show since 1999, at Liberty Stadium, Swansea on 28 May 2016. Special guests would include Super Furry Animals. The album would be performed in full. Before the final show in Swansea the band would tour the album with a series of UK dates: Liverpool, Echo Arena (13 May), Birmingham, Genting Arena (14 May), London, Royal Albert Hall (16–17 May), Leeds, First Direct Arena (20 May) and Glasgow, The SSE Hydro (21 May). In early 2016 the band announced European dates for the tour in Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

<doc id="590234" wikidata="Q3018061" url="?curid=590234" title="This Is the Army">
<text>This Is the Army is a 1943 American wartime musical comedy film produced by Jack L. Warner and Hal B. Wallis and directed by Michael Curtiz, adapted from a wartime stage musical with the same name, designed to boost morale in the U.S. during World War II, directed by Ezra Stone. The screenplay by Casey Robinson and Claude Binyon was based on the 1942 Broadway musical written by James McColl and Irving Berlin, with music and lyrics by Berlin. Berlin composed the film&#x27;s 19 songs, and sang one of them. 

The movie stars George Murphy, Joan Leslie, George Tobias, Ronald Reagan and Alan Hale, and features a large ensemble cast including Charles Butterworth, Dolores Costello, Una Merkel, Stanley Ridges, Rosemary de Camp, Ruth Donnelly, Dorothy Peterson, Frances Langford, Gertrude Niesen, Kate Smith, and Joe Louis. The cast of both the film, and the stage play on which it was based, included soldiers of the U.S. Army who were actors and performers in civilian life, including Reagan and Louis.

==Plot== 
In World War I, song-and-dance man Jerry Jones is drafted into the US Army, where he stages a revue called &quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot;. It is a rousing success, but one night during the show orders are received to leave immediately for France: instead of the finale, the troops march up the aisles through the audience, out the theater&#x27;s main entrance and into a convoy of waiting trucks. Among the teary, last-minute goodbyes Jones kisses his newlywed bride Ethel farewell.

In the trenches of France, several of the soldiers in the production are killed or wounded by shrapnel from a German artillery barrage. Jones is wounded in the leg and must walk with a cane, ending his career as a dancer. Nevertheless, he is resolved to find something useful to do, especially now that he is the father of a son. Sgt. McGee and Pvt. Eddie Dibble, the troop bugler, also survive.

Twenty-five years later World War II is raging in Europe. Jerry&#x27;s son Johnny enlists in the Army shortly after Pearl Harbor. He tells his sweetheart Eileen Dibble that they cannot marry until he returns, since he doesn&#x27;t want to make her a widow.

Johnny reluctantly accepts an order to stage another musical, following in his father&#x27;s footsteps. The show goes on tour throughout the United States and eventually plays Washington, D.C., in front of President Roosevelt. During the show it is announced that this is the last performance: the soldiers in the production have been ordered back to their combat units.

Eileen, who has joined the Red Cross auxiliary, appears backstage. During a break in the show she brings a minister and persuades Johnny that they should marry now – which they do, in the alley behind the theater, with their fathers acting as witnesses.

==Cast==


==Production==
Some location shooting for the film took place at Camp Cooke in central California. The Warner Ranch in Calabasas, California was used for the World War I battle scenes. 

The title of the movie is the same as the title of the stage version of the show. The movie features star appearances by Irving Berlin, Kate Smith, Frances Langford and Joe Louis as themselves. Smith&#x27;s full-length rendition of Berlin&#x27;s &quot;God Bless America&quot; is arguably the most famous cinematic rendition of the piece. Louis appears in a revue piece called &quot;What the Well-Dressed Man in Harlem Will Wear&quot;, with James Cross (lead singer and dancer), William Wycoff (dancer in drag), Marion Brown (heavyset dancer), and a chorus of perhaps a dozen, the only spoken/sung scene that includes African-Americans. Louis appears in two other scenes, one in a boxing match, and the second being the stage door canteen number. He did not speak in either scene.

George Murphy was not the first actor considered for the role of Jerry. Fred Astaire, Joseph Cotten and Walter Huston were all considered first. George Brent was also offered the role of Major (then Colonel) Davidson, which was played in the film by Stanley Ridges, but Brent refused to work without being paid. Ginger Rogers was considered for the role of Eileen, played in the film by Joan Leslie. Frances Langford sings the song &quot;What Does He Look Like?&quot;, but it was originally offered to Dinah Shore, who turned it down because she felt the lyrics made it more appropriate for a man to sing it.

One of the film&#x27;s highlights is Irving Berlin himself singing his song &quot;Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning&quot;, a scene borrowed from &quot;Yip! Yip! Yaphank!&quot;.

The celebrity impersonation &quot;hamburger&quot; sequence includes accurate spoofs of Broadway stars Jane Cowl, Lynn Fontanne, Alfred Lunt and Ethel Barrymore, and film stars Charles Boyer and Herbert Marshall. The Cowl, Fontanne and Barrymore impersonations are all performed as drag (entertainment). The revue pieces also include acrobat routines, several comedy pieces, and additional songs in drag (entertainment) (&quot;Ladies of the Chorus&quot; and &quot;Hostesses of the Stage Door Canteen&quot;), a magic skit, a minstrel show sketch (often removed from consumer videos and television broadcasts), and tributes to the Navy and the Air Corps.

Although the core of the movie consists of the musical numbers, the movie contains a veneer of a plot involving the wartime love interests of both the father and the son.

Producers Jack Warner and Hal Wallis, director Michael Curtiz and screenwriter Casey Robinson all donated their salaries to the Army Emergency Relief Fund.

Many of the soldiers who had participated in the show held reunions every five years after the end of World War II. Their tenth and final reunion (1992) was held in New York&#x27;s Theater District. Five hundred men were used in the final number &quot;This Will Be the Last Time&quot;.

==Release and reception==
The film&#x27;s New York premiere was at the Hollywood Theatre on Broadway on July 28, 1943. It premiered at the Warner&#x27;s Earle Theater in Washington, D.C. on August 12, 1943.

===Box office===
The film grossed $9,555,586 (equal to $ today), which was donated to Army Emergency Relief. It produced rental revenue of $8,301,000 in the United States and Canada, and $2,144,000 overseas, for a total of $10,445,000. It was the highest-grossing musical film of all-time until it was surpassed by &quot;White Christmas&quot; in 1954. The receipts from &quot;This Is the Army&quot; place it among the top 40 movies of all time in U.S. box office popularity, which considers both inflation and the size of the population when the movie was released.

By the mid-1970s, the movie fell into the public domain, occasionally airing on television to a new generation of viewers. Renewed interest in some of the actors helped some actors that might have been considered down-and-out, most notably Stump and Stumpy&#x27;s Jimmy Cross and Harold Cromer.

===Awards and honors===
The film received several Academy Award nominations, including Ray Heindorf for his musical score, Best Art Direction-Interior Decoration in a Color Film, and Bes/t Sound Recording. Heindorf was the only winner for the film.

&quot;My British Buddy&quot;, also sung by Irving Berlin, was cut from the film, but was released on DVD. It was originally added to the British production of the stage musical.

==Award and honors==
The musical score was nominated for and won the Oscar for Music (Scoring of a Musical Picture) (Ray Heindorf) at the 16th Annual Academy Awards. The film was also nominated in the category Best Sound (Nathan Levinson), but lost to &quot;This Land Is Mine&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; presented a broadcast of the show on February 22, 1943, featuring 200 soldiers and a chorus of professional singers.

<doc id="590237" wikidata="Q152963" url="?curid=590237" title="4197 Morpheus">
<text>4197 Morpheus, provisional designation , is a highly eccentric asteroid and near-Earth object of the Apollo group, approximately 3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 11 October 1982, by American astronomers Eleanor Helin and Eugene Shoemaker at Palomar Observatory in California, United States. The asteroid was later named for Morpheus from Greek mythology.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Morpheus&quot; orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.5–4.1 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,271 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.77 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. Due to this elongated orbit, the asteroid is both, a Mars-crosser and a Venus-crosser.

It has a minimum orbit intersection distance with Earth of , which corresponds to 38.5 lunar distances.

A first precovery was taken at the discovering observatory in 1954, extending the body&#x27;s observation arc by 28 years prior to its official discovery observation.

== Physical characteristics ==

On the SMASS taxonomic scheme, &quot;Morpheus&quot; is classified as a stony Sq sub-type, which transitions from the common S-type to the rather rare Q-type asteroids.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

In the 1990s, Tom Gehrels gave a first diameter estimate for &quot;Morpheus&quot; of 1.8 kilometers.
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), it measures 3.043 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.276. In 2012, a revision of the published WISE-data by Petr Pravec gave a diameter of 2.981 kilometers and an albedo of 0.2389. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; adopts the revised WISE-data and takes a diameter of 2.98 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 14.8.

=== Rotation and shape ===

In 1996, a rotational lightcurve was obtained by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at the Ondřejov Observatory during the body&#x27;s close approach to Earth within 0.1 AU. It gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.49 magnitude ().

At the same time, astronomers at the Goldstone Observatory analysed &quot;Morpheus&quot; using radar delay-Doppler imaging. The resultant images are not very clear, but they show that the body has a roughly triangular shape, and a 3-hour rotation period.

Seven years later, during the asteroid&#x27;s next close approach in 2003, &quot;Morpheus&quot; was observed for five nights by Slovak astronomer Adrián Galád at the Modra Observatory. Lightcurve analysis showed a concurring period of hours and an amplitude of 0.4 in magnitude ().

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after Morpheus from Greek mythology. He is a god of dreams who appears in the poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; written by the Roman poet Ovid. He is capable to imitate any human form and to appear in dreams.

The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 5 January 2015 ().

<text>The desert night lizard (Xantusia vigilis) is a night lizard native to the Southern California Eastern Sierra and the San Gabriel Mountains into Baja California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah and extreme western areas of Arizona.

== Description ==

The desert night lizard attains a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of with a tail roughly the same length. The lizard&#x27;s coloring is usually grey, yellow-brownish, or olive. Despite their name, night lizards are active during the day. They are known to easily change their color, from light olive (usually during the evening) to dark brown during the day. It is a good climber and usually eats termites, small insects, spiders and other arthropods.

The desert night lizard is small for a reptile, with the average adult female at 80 mm in total length and 1.3 g in weight. The average adult male &quot;Xantusia vigilis&quot; is 65mm in total length and 1.1 g in weight. Male desert night lizards are distinguishable from females as they are lighter and shorter in length. They also have a stouter and wider tail, as well as enlarged femoral pores. Most desert night lizards have 12 longitudinal rows of rectangular ventral scales with 30-50 granular dorsal scales around their mid-region. Above each eye, they have supraorbital scales (one around the nasal bone, two frontal ones, and two parietal scales). Typically, the color along their body ranges from light gray to brown. They can often be a single, uniform color, but some species have been found to have dark spots.

== Habitat and distribution ==

The lizard lives in arid and semi-arid locales. During the day, it frequently may be found in rock crevices or under fallen plant debris. It is usually associated with varieties of yucca such as the Joshua Tree, Spanish Dagger, and Spanish Bayonet.

&quot;X. vigilis&quot; can be found along the Southwestern coast of the United States and northern regions of Mexico. There is great prevalence of &quot;X. vigilis&quot; in the Mohave and Sonoran Deserts, throughout southern California and Baja California. Smaller populations of &quot;X. vigilis&quot; have been found in western Arizona, some coastal ranges within Central California, Colorado, the Sierra Nevada, and Utah.

&quot;X. vigilis&quot; received its more common name &#x27;yucca night lizard,&#x27; because of its frequent prevalence around plants of the &quot;Yucca&quot; genus, such as Joshua Trees. &quot;X. vigilis&quot; is one of the few species of lizard or vertebrates that have this type of plant based habitat occupation. While this lizard is widespread across various regions in the United States and Mexico, its local environmental settings seem standardized across its habitat range. The desert night lizard is most commonly found underneath fallen dead trees, fallen ecological debris (plant limbs, Spanish dagger, Quixote Plants), and amongst the spiny leaves of Joshua Trees. The desert night lizard avoids visibility and may select its habitat as an added layer of protection and obscurity from predatory species. This lizard is not isolated to areas with Yucca plants, but higher population density is usually associated with the presence of Yucca plants.

==Social behavior==

Like all night lizards, the desert night lizard is viviparous, giving birth to live young and producing 1 to 3 young from August to December. Unusually for a lizard, it forms family social groups with a father-mother pair and offspring, which may delay dispersing for years. The young are capable of feeding themselves but will huddle together with their relatives. They do not receive direct care from their parents and older siblings, and it is not yet known what the advantages of staying with their family members are. The baby lizards are well-camouflaged and are not much bigger than a toothpick.

Groups of &quot;Xantusia vigilis&quot; with higher levels of kin relatedness proved to be more stable than congregates of &quot;X. vigilis&quot; that lacked close genetic relationships. It is believed that kin presence for these lizard encourages philopatry (or the tendency for an animal to remain in the region of their birth as it proves advantageous to remain in a group) and winter aggregation. Reproductive success was heightened for female &quot;X. vigilis&quot; when kin presence and kin relatedness within a living group was observed.

Winter groups (aggregates formed to survive through the cold winter) proved advantageous, allowing for greater internal heat retention for individual lizards and for the collective group as a whole. Most winter groups are as large as 20 lizards. However, winter groups do not last past the winter months, typically dissolving by the time copulation occurs in June. Socially, &quot;X. vigilis&quot; is a largely sedentary species of lizard that remains obscure and hidden from plain sight. &quot;X. vigilis&quot; follow the group stability hypothesis and are more stable within their families.

== Reproduction and life cycle ==
&quot;Xantusia vigilis&quot; typically give birth to no more than two offspring per birth. There is a laterality preference based on the specific oviduct and ovary used for ovulation; when only a single ovum is ovulated there is a pressure for the right ovary to overproduce a larger number of mature ova.

Reproduction within &quot;X. vigilis&quot; is dependent on a few factors, largely centering around climate variations, diet, and nutrition.
Climatic changes heavily dictate the proceedings of gestation within &quot;X. vigilis&quot;. In damp climates this species of lizard will either prepone or postpone ovulation for drier conditions. For example, in a particularly damp spring, ovulation is typically postponed to occur in the middle of the following summer. Regardless of climate, breeding typically occurs during the spring and winter.
Diet carries a similar importance on determining the reproductive success of a given breeding season. Improper diet and malnutrition often leads to underdeveloped ova and lacking yolk deposition within female desert night lizards. Overly dry climates are heavily associated with underdevelopment in reproductive organs and reduced reproductive processes. One notable exception is that males experiencing drier climates and low resource settings have been shown to reach a greater level of testicular maturation.

The ovulation period for &quot;X. vigilis&quot; lasts approximately 2 weeks at an optimal temperature range of . Gestation typically lasts 90 days. No day versus night preference exists for birth itself, where the event of delivery lasts about 10 minutes. Desert night lizards may live for 8–10 years.

Among night lizards, only a certain percentage of adult females will reproduce in a given year.

The &quot;X. vigilis&quot; placenta is well developed to allow for exchange of amino acids between mother and fetus. Half of the embryo&#x27;s weight gain is suspected to happen during the brief egg gestation period, from the oviduct wall to the placenta. At birth, neonates average 22–23 mm in length (SVL) and weigh approximately 0.23g. &quot;X. vigilis&quot; mothers are reported to eat their fetal membranes.

<doc id="590246" wikidata="Q129864" url="?curid=590246" title="Indian Rebellion of 1857">
<text>The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in 1857–58 against the rule of the British East India Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the company&#x27;s army in the garrison town of Meerut, northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels&#x27; defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 1859.

The name of the revolt is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.

The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, and scepticism about British claims that their rule offered material improvement to the Indian economy. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.

After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company&#x27;s response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning&#x27;s words, as &quot;breakwaters in a storm&quot;.

In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system. Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the administration in India, through passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered directly by the British government in the new British Raj. On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation to Indians, which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen&#x27;s proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.

== East India Company&#x27;s expansion in India ==


Although the British East India Company had established a presence in India as far back as 1612, and earlier administered the factory areas established for trading purposes, its victory in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of its firm foothold in eastern India. The victory was consolidated in 1764 at the Battle of Buxar, when the East India Company army defeated Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. After his defeat, the emperor granted the company the right to the &quot;collection of Revenue&quot; in the provinces of Bengal (modern day Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha), known as &quot;Diwani&quot; to the company. The Company soon expanded its territories around its bases in Bombay and Madras; later, the Anglo-Mysore Wars (1766–1799) and the Anglo-Maratha Wars (1772–1818) led to control of even more of India.

In 1806, the Vellore Mutiny was sparked by new uniform regulations that created resentment amongst both Hindu and Muslim sepoys.

After the turn of the 19th century, Governor-General Wellesley began what became two decades of accelerated expansion of Company territories. This was achieved either by subsidiary alliances between the company and local rulers or by direct military annexation. The subsidiary alliances created the princely states of the Hindu maharajas and the Muslim nawabs. Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir were annexed after the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849; however, Kashmir was immediately sold under the 1846 Treaty of Amritsar to the Dogra Dynasty of Jammu and thereby became a princely state. The border dispute between Nepal and British India, which sharpened after 1801, had caused the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814–16 and brought the defeated Gurkhas under British influence. In 1854, Berar was annexed, and the state of Oudh was added two years later. For practical purposes, the company was the government of much of India.

== Causes of the rebellion ==

The Indian Rebellion of 1857 occurred as the result of an accumulation of factors over time, rather than any single event.

The &quot;sepoys&quot; were Indian soldiers who were recruited into the company&#x27;s army. Just before the rebellion, there were over 300,000 sepoys in the army, compared to about 50,000 British. The East India Company&#x27;s forces were divided into three presidency armies: Bombay, Madras, and Bengal. The Bengal Army recruited higher castes, such as Brahmins, Rajputs and Bhumihar, mostly from the Awadh and Bihar regions, and even restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the Madras Army and Bombay Army were &quot;more localized, caste-neutral armies&quot; that &quot;did not prefer high-caste men&quot;. The domination of higher castes in the Bengal Army has been blamed in part for initial mutinies that led to the rebellion.

In 1772, when Warren Hastings was appointed Fort William&#x27;s first Governor-General, one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the company&#x27;s army. Since the sepoys from Bengal – many of whom had fought against the Company in the Battles of Plassey and Buxar – were now suspect in British eyes, Hastings recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs and Bhumihar of Awadh and Bihar, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. However, in order to forestall any social friction, the company also took action to adapt its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in addition, overseas service, considered polluting to their caste, was not required of them, and the army soon came officially to recognise Hindu festivals. &quot;This encouragement of high caste ritual status, however, left the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys detected infringement of their prerogatives.&quot; Stokes argues that &quot;The British scrupulously avoided interference with the social structure of the village community which remained largely intact.&quot;

After the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their perquisites, as landed gentry, in the Oudh courts, and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments that the annexation might bring about. Other historians have stressed that by 1857, some Indian soldiers, interpreting the presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were convinced that the company was masterminding mass conversions of Hindus and Muslims to Christianity. Although earlier in the 1830s, evangelicals such as William Carey and William Wilberforce had successfully clamoured for the passage of social reform, such as the abolition of &quot;sati&quot; and allowing the remarriage of Hindu widows, there is little evidence that the sepoys&#x27; allegiance was affected by this.

However, changes in the terms of their professional service may have created resentment. As the extent of the East India Company&#x27;s jurisdiction expanded with victories in wars or annexation, the soldiers were now expected not only to serve in less familiar regions, such as in Burma, but also to make do without the &quot;foreign service&quot; remuneration that had previously been their due.

A major cause of resentment that arose ten months prior to the outbreak of the rebellion was the General Service Enlistment Act of 25 July 1856. As noted above, men of the Bengal Army had been exempted from overseas service. Specifically, they were enlisted only for service in territories to which they could march. Governor-General Lord Dalhousie saw this as an anomaly, since all sepoys of the Madras and Bombay Armies and the six &quot;General Service&quot; battalions of the Bengal Army had accepted an obligation to serve overseas if required. As a result, the burden of providing contingents for active service in Burma, readily accessible only by sea, and China had fallen disproportionately on the two smaller Presidency Armies. As signed into effect by Lord Canning, Dalhousie&#x27;s successor as Governor-General, the act required only new recruits to the Bengal Army to accept a commitment for general service. However, serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that it would be eventually extended to them, as well as preventing sons following fathers into an army with a strong tradition of family service.

There were also grievances over the issue of promotions, based on seniority. This, as well as the increasing number of British officers in the battalions, made promotion slow, and many Indian officers did not reach commissioned rank until they were too old to be effective.

=== The Enfield rifle ===

The final spark was provided by the ammunition for the new Enfield Pattern 1853 rifled musket. These rifles, which fired Minié balls, had a tighter fit than the earlier muskets, and used paper cartridges that came pre-greased. To load the rifle, sepoys had to bite the cartridge open to release the powder. The grease used on these cartridges was rumoured to include tallow derived from beef, which would be offensive to Hindus, and lard derived from pork, which would be offensive to Muslims. At least one Company official pointed out the difficulties this might cause:
However, in August 1856, greased cartridge production was initiated at Fort William, Calcutta, following a British design. The grease used included tallow supplied by the Indian firm of Gangadarh Banerji &amp; Co. By January, rumours abounded that the Enfield cartridges were greased with animal fat.

Company officers became aware of the rumours through reports of an altercation between a high-caste sepoy and a low-caste labourer at Dum Dum. The labourer had taunted the sepoy that by biting the cartridge, he had himself lost caste, although at this time such cartridges had been issued only at Meerut and not at Dum Dum. There had been rumours that the British sought to destroy the religions of the Indian people, and forcing the native soldiers to break their sacred code would have certainly added to this rumour, as it apparently did. The company was quick to reverse the effects of this policy in hopes that the unrest would be quelled.

On 27 January, Colonel Richard Birch, the Military Secretary, ordered that all cartridges issued from depots were to be free from grease, and that sepoys could grease them themselves using whatever mixture &quot;they may prefer&quot;. A modification was also made to the drill for loading so that the cartridge was torn with the hands and not bitten. This, however, merely caused many sepoys to be convinced that the rumours were true and that their fears were justified. Additional rumours started that the paper in the new cartridges, which was glazed and stiffer than the previously used paper, was impregnated with grease. In February, a court of inquiry was held at Barrackpore to get to the bottom of these rumours. Native soldiers called as witnesses complained of the paper &quot;being stiff and like cloth in the mode of tearing&quot;, said that when the paper was burned it smelled of grease, and announced that the suspicion that the paper itself contained grease could not be removed from their minds.

=== Civilian disquiet ===
Civilian rebellion was more multifarious. The rebels consisted of three groups: the feudal nobility, rural landlords called &quot;taluqdars&quot;, and the peasants. The nobility, many of whom had lost titles and domains under the Doctrine of Lapse, which refused to recognise the adopted children of princes as legal heirs, felt that the company had interfered with a traditional system of inheritance. Rebel leaders such as Nana Sahib and the Rani of Jhansi belonged to this group; the latter, for example, was prepared to accept East India Company supremacy if her adopted son was recognised as her late husband&#x27;s heir. In other areas of central India, such as Indore and Sagar, where such loss of privilege had not occurred, the princes remained loyal to the company, even in areas where the sepoys had rebelled. The second group, the &quot;taluqdars&quot;, had lost half their landed estates to peasant farmers as a result of the land reforms that came in the wake of annexation of Oudh. It is mentioned that throughout Oudh and Bihar Rajput Taluqdars provided the bulk of leadership and played an important role during 1857 in the region. As the rebellion gained ground, the &quot;taluqdars&quot; quickly reoccupied the lands they had lost, and paradoxically, in part because of ties of kinship and feudal loyalty, did not experience significant opposition from the peasant farmers, many of whom joined the rebellion, to the great dismay of the British. It has also been suggested that heavy land-revenue assessment in some areas by the British resulted in many landowning families either losing their land or going into great debt to money lenders, and providing ultimately a reason to rebel; money lenders, in addition to the company, were particular objects of the rebels&#x27; animosity. The civilian rebellion was also highly uneven in its geographic distribution, even in areas of north-central India that were no longer under British control. For example, the relatively prosperous Muzaffarnagar district, a beneficiary of a Company irrigation scheme, and next door to Meerut, where the upheaval began, stayed relatively calm throughout.

&quot;Utilitarian and evangelical-inspired social reform&quot;, including the abolition of sati and the legalisation of widow remarriage were considered by many—especially the British themselves—to have caused suspicion that Indian religious traditions were being &quot;interfered with&quot;, with the ultimate aim of conversion. Recent historians, including Chris Bayly, have preferred to frame this as a &quot;clash of knowledges&quot;, with proclamations from religious authorities before the revolt and testimony after it including on such issues as the &quot;insults to women&quot;, the rise of &quot;low people&#x27; under British tutelage&quot;, the &quot;pollution&quot; caused by Western medicine and the persecuting and ignoring of traditional astrological authorities. British-run schools were also a problem: according to recorded testimonies, anger had spread because of stories that mathematics was replacing religious instruction, stories were chosen that would &quot;bring contempt&quot; upon Indian religions, and because girl children were exposed to &quot;moral danger&quot; by education.

The justice system was considered to be inherently unfair to the Indians. The official Blue Books, &quot;East India (Torture) 1855–1857&quot;, laid before the House of Commons during the sessions of 1856 and 1857, revealed that Company officers were allowed an extended series of appeals if convicted or accused of brutality or crimes against Indians.

The economic policies of the East India Company were also resented by many Indians.

=== The Bengal Army ===

Each of the three &quot;Presidencies&quot; into which the East India Company divided India for administrative purposes maintained their own armies. Of these, the Army of the Bengal Presidency was the largest. Unlike the other two, it recruited heavily from among high-caste Hindus and comparatively wealthy Muslims. The Muslims formed a larger percentage of the 18 irregular cavalry units within the Bengal Army, whilst Hindus were mainly to be found in the 84 regular infantry and cavalry regiments. Thus 75% of the cavalry regiments was composed of Indian Muslims, while 80% of the infantry was composed of Hindus. The sepoys were therefore affected to a large degree by the concerns of the landholding and traditional members of Indian society. In the early years of Company rule, it tolerated and even encouraged the caste privileges and customs within the Bengal Army, which recruited its regular infantry soldiers almost exclusively amongst the landowning Rajputs and Brahmins of the Bihar and Oudh regions. These soldiers were known as Purbiyas. By the time these customs and privileges came to be threatened by modernising regimes in Calcutta from the 1840s onwards, the sepoys had become accustomed to very high ritual status and were extremely sensitive to suggestions that their caste might be polluted.

The sepoys also gradually became dissatisfied with various other aspects of army life. Their pay was relatively low and after Oudh and the Punjab were annexed, the soldiers no longer received extra pay (&quot;batta&quot; or &quot;bhatta&quot;) for service there, because they were no longer considered &quot;foreign missions&quot;. The junior British officers became increasingly estranged from their soldiers, in many cases treating them as their racial inferiors. In 1856, a new Enlistment Act was introduced by the company, which in theory made every unit in the Bengal Army liable to service overseas. Although it was intended to apply only to new recruits, the serving sepoys feared that the Act might be applied retroactively to them as well. A high-caste Hindu who travelled in the cramped conditions of a wooden troop ship could not cook his own food on his own fire, and accordingly risked losing caste through ritual pollution.

== Onset of the rebellion ==
Several months of increasing tensions coupled with various incidents preceded the actual rebellion. On 26 February 1857 the 19th Bengal Native Infantry (BNI) regiment became concerned that new cartridges they had been issued were wrapped in paper greased with cow and pig fat, which had to be opened by mouth thus affecting their religious sensibilities. Their Colonel confronted them supported by artillery and cavalry on the parade ground, but after some negotiation withdrew the artillery, and cancelled the next morning&#x27;s parade.

=== Mangal Pandey ===

On 29 March 1857 at the Barrackpore parade ground, near Calcutta, 29-year-old Mangal Pandey of the 34th BNI, angered by the recent actions of the East India Company, declared that he would rebel against his commanders. Informed about Pandey&#x27;s behaviour Sergeant-Major James Hewson went to investigate, only to have Pandey shoot at him. Hewson raised the alarm. When his Adjutant Lt. Henry Baugh came out to investigate the unrest, Pandey opened fire but hit Baugh&#x27;s horse instead.

General John Hearsey came out to the parade ground to investigate, and claimed later that Mangal Pandey was in some kind of &quot;religious frenzy&quot;. He ordered the Indian commander of the Quarter Guard Jemadar Ishwari Prasad to arrest Mangal Pandey, but the Jemadar refused. The quarter guard and other sepoys present, with the single exception of a soldier called Shaikh Paltu, drew back from restraining or arresting Mangal Pandey. Shaikh Paltu restrained Pandey from continuing his attack.

After failing to incite his comrades into an open and active rebellion, Mangal Pandey tried to take his own life, by placing his musket to his chest and pulling the trigger with his toe. He managed only to wound himself. He was court-martialled on 6 April and hanged two days later.

The Jemadar Ishwari Prasad was sentenced to death and hanged on 21 April. The regiment was disbanded and stripped of its uniforms because it was felt that it harboured ill-feelings towards its superiors, particularly after this incident. Shaikh Paltu was promoted to the rank of havildar in the Bengal Army but was murdered shortly before the 34th BNI dispersed.

Sepoys in other regiments thought these punishments were harsh. The demonstration of disgrace during the formal disbanding helped foment the rebellion in view of some historians. Disgruntled ex-sepoys returned home to Awadh with a desire for revenge.

=== Unrest during April 1857 ===
During April, there was unrest and fires at Agra, Allahabad and Ambala. At Ambala in particular, which was a large military cantonment where several units had been collected for their annual musketry practice, it was clear to General Anson, Commander-in-Chief of the Bengal Army, that some sort of rebellion over the cartridges was imminent. Despite the objections of the civilian Governor-General&#x27;s staff, he agreed to postpone the musketry practice and allow a new drill by which the soldiers tore the cartridges with their fingers rather than their teeth. However, he issued no general orders making this standard practice throughout the Bengal Army and, rather than remain at Ambala to defuse or overawe potential trouble, he then proceeded to Simla, the cool hill station where many high officials spent the summer.

Although there was no open revolt at Ambala, there was widespread arson during late April. Barrack buildings (especially those belonging to soldiers who had used the Enfield cartridges) and British officers&#x27; bungalows were set on fire.

=== Meerut ===

At Meerut, a large military cantonment, 2,357 Indian sepoys and 2,038 British soldiers were stationed along with 12 British-manned guns. The station held one of the largest concentrations of British troops in India and this was later to be cited as evidence that the original rising was a spontaneous outbreak rather than a pre-planned plot.

Although the state of unrest within the Bengal Army was well known, on 24 April Lieutenant Colonel George Carmichael-Smyth, the unsympathetic commanding officer of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry, which was composed mainly of Indian Muslims, ordered 90 of his men to parade and perform firing drills. All except five of the men on parade refused to accept their cartridges. On 9 May, the remaining 85 men were court martialled, and most were sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour. Eleven comparatively young soldiers were given five years&#x27; imprisonment. The entire garrison was paraded and watched as the condemned men were stripped of their uniforms and placed in shackles. As they were marched off to jail, the condemned soldiers berated their comrades for failing to support them.

The next day was Sunday. Some Indian soldiers warned off-duty junior British officers that plans were afoot to release the imprisoned soldiers by force, but the senior officers to whom this was reported took no action. There was also unrest in the city of Meerut itself, with angry protests in the bazaar and some buildings being set on fire. In the evening, most British officers were preparing to attend church, while many of the British soldiers were off duty and had gone into canteens or into the bazaar in Meerut. The Indian troops, led by the 3rd Cavalry, broke into revolt. British junior officers who attempted to quell the first outbreaks were killed by the rebels. British officers&#x27; and civilians&#x27; quarters were attacked, and four civilian men, eight women and eight children were killed. Crowds in the bazaar attacked off-duty soldiers there. About 50 Indian civilians, some of them officers&#x27; servants who tried to defend or conceal their employers, were killed by the sepoys. While the action of the sepoys in freeing their 85 imprisoned comrades appears to have been spontaneous, some civilian rioting in the city was reportedly encouraged by Kotwal (chief police officer) Dhan Singh Gurjar.

Some sepoys (especially from the 11th Bengal Native Infantry) escorted trusted British officers and women and children to safety before joining the revolt. Some officers and their families escaped to Rampur, where they found refuge with the Nawab.

The British historian Philip Mason notes that it was inevitable that most of the sepoys and sowars from Meerut should have made for Delhi on the night of 10 May. It was a strong walled city located only forty miles away, it was the ancient capital and present seat of the nominal Mughal Emperor and finally there were no British troops in garrison there in contrast to Meerut. No effort was made to pursue them.

=== Delhi ===

Early on 11 May, the first parties of the 3rd Cavalry reached Delhi. From beneath the windows of the Emperor&#x27;s apartments in the palace, they called on Bahadur Shah II to acknowledge and lead them. He did nothing at this point, apparently treating the sepoys as ordinary petitioners, but others in the palace were quick to join the revolt. During the day, the revolt spread. British officials and dependents, Indian Christians and shop keepers within the city were killed, some by sepoys and others by crowds of rioters.

There were three battalion-sized regiments of Bengal Native Infantry stationed in or near the city. Some detachments quickly joined the rebellion, while others held back but also refused to obey orders to take action against the rebels. In the afternoon, a violent explosion in the city was heard for several miles. Fearing that the arsenal, which contained large stocks of arms and ammunition, would fall intact into rebel hands, the nine British Ordnance officers there had opened fire on the sepoys, including the men of their own guard. When resistance appeared hopeless, they blew up the arsenal. Six of the nine officers survived, but the blast killed many in the streets and nearby houses and other buildings. The news of these events finally tipped the sepoys stationed around Delhi into open rebellion. The sepoys were later able to salvage at least some arms from the arsenal, and a magazine two miles () outside Delhi, containing up to 3,000 barrels of gunpowder, was captured without resistance.

Many fugitive British officers and civilians had congregated at the Flagstaff Tower on the ridge north of Delhi, where telegraph operators were sending news of the events to other British stations. When it became clear that the help expected from Meerut was not coming, they made their way in carriages to Karnal. Those who became separated from the main body or who could not reach the Flagstaff Tower also set out for Karnal on foot. Some were helped by villagers on the way; others were killed.

The next day, Bahadur Shah held his first formal court for many years. It was attended by many excited sepoys. The emperor was alarmed by the turn events had taken, but eventually accepted the sepoys&#x27; allegiance and agreed to give his countenance to the rebellion. On 16 May, up to 50 British who had been held prisoner in the palace or had been discovered hiding in the city were killed by some of the emperor&#x27;s servants under a peepul tree in a courtyard outside the palace.

== Supporters and opposition ==
The news of the events at Meerut and Delhi spread rapidly, provoking uprisings among sepoys and disturbances in many districts. In many cases, it was the behaviour of British military and civilian authorities themselves which precipitated disorder. Learning of the fall of Delhi, many Company administrators hastened to remove themselves, their families and servants to places of safety. At Agra, from Delhi, no fewer than 6,000 assorted non-combatants converged on the Fort.

The military authorities also reacted in disjointed manner. Some officers trusted their sepoys, but others tried to disarm them to forestall potential uprisings. At Benares and Allahabad, the disarmings were bungled, also leading to local revolts.
In 1857, the Bengal Army had 86,000 men, of which 12,000 were British, 16,000 Sikh and 1,500 Gurkha. There were 311,000 native soldiers in India altogether, 40,160 British soldiers (including units of the British Army) and 5,362 officers. Fifty-four of the Bengal Army&#x27;s 74 regular Native Infantry Regiments mutinied, but some were immediately destroyed or broke up, with their sepoys drifting away to their homes. A number of the remaining 20 regiments were disarmed or disbanded to prevent or forestall mutiny. Only twelve of the original Bengal Native Infantry regiments survived to pass into the new Indian Army. All ten of the Bengal Light Cavalry regiments mutinied.

The Bengal Army also contained 29 irregular cavalry and 42 irregular infantry regiments. Of these, a substantial contingent from the recently annexed state of Awadh mutinied &quot;en masse&quot;. Another large contingent from Gwalior also mutinied, even though that state&#x27;s king (Jayajirao Scindia) supported the British. The remainder of the irregular units were raised from a wide variety of sources and were less affected by the concerns of mainstream Indian society. Some irregular units actively supported the company: three Gurkha and five of six Sikh infantry units, and the six infantry and six cavalry units of the recently raised Punjab Irregular Force.

On 1 April 1858, the number of Indian soldiers in the Bengal army loyal to the company was 80,053. However large numbers were hastily raised in the Punjab and North-West Frontier after the outbreak of the Rebellion.

The Bombay army had three mutinies in its 29 regiments, whilst the Madras Army had none at all, although elements of one of its 52 regiments refused to volunteer for service in Bengal. Nonetheless, most of southern India remained passive, with only intermittent outbreaks of violence. Many parts of the region were ruled by the Nizams or the Mysore royalty, and were thus not directly under British rule.
Although most of the mutinous sepoys in Delhi were Hindus, a significant proportion of the insurgents were Muslims. The proportion of &quot;ghazis&quot; grew to be about a quarter of the local fighting force by the end of the siege and included a regiment of suicide &quot;ghazis&quot; from Gwalior who had vowed never to eat again and to fight until they met certain death at the hands of British troops. However, most Muslims did not share the rebels&#x27; dislike of the British administration and their ulema could not agree on whether to declare a jihad. Some Islamic scholars such as Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi and Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi took up arms against the colonial rule, but many Muslims, among them ulema from both the Sunni and Shia sects, sided with the British. Various Ahl-i-Hadith scholars and colleagues of Nanautavi rejected the jihad. The most influential member of Ahl-i-Hadith ulema in Delhi, Maulana Sayyid Nazir Husain Dehlvi, resisted pressure from the mutineers to call for a jihad and instead declared in favour of British rule, viewing the Muslim-British relationship as a legal contract which could not be broken unless their religious rights were breached.
The Sikhs and Pathans of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province supported the British and helped in the recapture of Delhi. The Sikhs in particular feared reinstatement of Mughal rule in northern India because they had been persecuted by the Mughal Empire. They also felt disdain towards the &quot;Purbiyas&quot; or &#x27;Easterners&#x27; (Biharis and those from the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh) in the Bengal Army. The Sikhs felt that the bloodiest battles of the First and Second Anglo-Sikh wars (Chillianwala and Ferozeshah), had been won by British troops, while the Hindustani sepoys had refused to meet the Sikhs in battle. These feelings were compounded when Hindustani sepoys were assigned a very visible role as garrison troops in Punjab and awarded profit-making civil posts in the Punjab.

The varied groups in the support and opposing of the uprising is seen as a major cause of its failure.

== The revolt ==
=== Initial stages ===


Bahadur Shah II was proclaimed the Emperor of the whole of India. Most contemporary and modern accounts suggest that he was coerced by the sepoys and his courtiers to sign the proclamation against his will. In spite of the significant loss of power that the Mughal dynasty had suffered in the preceding centuries, their name still carried great prestige across northern India. Civilians, nobility and other dignitaries took an oath of allegiance. The emperor issued coins in his name, one of the oldest ways of asserting imperial status. The adhesion of the Mughal emperor, however, turned the Sikhs of the Punjab away from the rebellion, as they did not want to return to Islamic rule, having fought many wars against the Mughal rulers. The province of Bengal was largely quiet throughout the entire period. The British, who had long ceased to take the authority of the Mughal Emperor seriously, were astonished at how the ordinary people responded to Bahadur Shah&#x27;s call for war.

Initially, the Indian rebels were able to push back Company forces, and captured several important towns in Haryana, Bihar, the Central Provinces and the United Provinces. When British troops were reinforced and began to counterattack, the mutineers were especially handicapped by their lack of centralized command and control. Although the rebels produced some natural leaders such as Bakht Khan, whom the Emperor later nominated as commander-in-chief after his son Mirza Mughal proved ineffectual, for the most part they were forced to look for leadership to rajahs and princes. Some of these were to prove dedicated leaders, but others were self-interested or inept.

In the countryside around Meerut, a general Gurjar uprising posed the largest threat to the British. In Parikshitgarh near Meerut, Gurjars declared Rao Kadam Singh (Kuddum Singh) their leader, and expelled Company police. Kadam Singh Gurjar led a large force, estimates varying from 2,000 to 10,000. Bulandshahr and Bijnor also came under the control of Gurjars under Walidad Khan and Maho Singh respectively. Contemporary sources report that nearly all the Gurjar villages between Meerut and Delhi participated in the revolt, in some cases with support from Jullundur, and it was not until late July that, with the help of local Jats, and the princely states, the British managed to regain control of the area.

The Imperial Gazetteer of India states that throughout the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Gurjars and Ranghars proved the &quot;most irreconcilable enemies&quot; of the British in the Bulandshahr area.

Mufti Nizamuddin, a renowned scholar of Lahore, issued a Fatwa against the British forces and called upon the local population to support the forces of Rao Tula Ram. Casualties were high at the subsequent engagement at Narnaul (Nasibpur). After the defeat of Rao Tula Ram on 16 November 1857, Mufti Nizamuddin was arrested, and his brother Mufti Yaqinuddin and brother-in-law Abdur Rahman (alias Nabi Baksh) were arrested in Tijara. They were taken to Delhi and hanged.

=== Siege of Delhi ===


The British were slow to strike back at first. It took time for troops stationed in Britain to make their way to India by sea, although some regiments moved overland through Persia from the Crimean War, and some regiments already &quot;en route&quot; for China were diverted to India.

It took time to organise the British troops already in India into field forces, but eventually two columns left Meerut and Simla. They proceeded slowly towards Delhi and fought, killed, and hanged numerous Indians along the way. Two months after the first outbreak of rebellion at Meerut, the two forces met near Karnal. The combined force, including two Gurkha units serving in the Bengal Army under contract from the Kingdom of Nepal, fought the rebels&#x27; main army at Badli-ke-Serai and drove them back to Delhi.

The company&#x27;s army established a base on the Delhi ridge to the north of the city and the Siege of Delhi began. The siege lasted roughly from 1 July to 21 September. However, the encirclement was hardly complete, and for much of the siege the besiegers were outnumbered and it often seemed that it was the Company forces and not Delhi that were under siege, as the rebels could easily receive resources and reinforcements. For several weeks, it seemed likely that disease, exhaustion and continuous sorties by rebels from Delhi would force the besiegers to withdraw, but the outbreaks of rebellion in the Punjab were forestalled or suppressed, allowing the Punjab Movable Column of British, Sikh and Pashtun soldiers under John Nicholson to reinforce the besiegers on the Ridge on 14 August. On 30 August the rebels offered terms, which were refused.

An eagerly awaited heavy siege train joined the besieging force, and from 7 September, the siege guns battered breaches in the walls and silenced the rebels&#x27; artillery. An attempt to storm the city through the breaches and the Kashmiri Gate was launched on 14 September. The attackers gained a foothold within the city but suffered heavy casualties, including John Nicholson. Major General Archdale Wilson, the British commander, wished to withdraw, but was persuaded to hold on by his junior officers. After a week of street fighting, the British reached the Red Fort. Bahadur Shah Zafar had already fled to Humayun&#x27;s tomb.

The troops of the besieging force proceeded to loot and pillage the city. A large number of citizens were killed in retaliation for the British and Indian civilians that had been slaughtered by the rebels. During the street fighting, artillery was set up in the city&#x27;s main mosque. Neighbourhoods within range were bombarded; the homes of the Muslim nobility that housed innumerable cultural, artistic, literary and monetary riches were destroyed.

The British soon arrested Bahadur Shah Zafar, and the next day the British Major William Hodson had his sons Mirza Mughal and Mirza Khizr Sultan and grandson Mirza Abu Bakr shot under his own authority at the Khooni Darwaza (the bloody gate) near Delhi Gate. On hearing the news, Zafar reacted with shocked silence, while his wife Zinat Mahal was content, as she believed her son was now Zafar&#x27;s heir. Shortly after the fall of Delhi, the victorious attackers organised a column that relieved another besieged Company force in Agra, and then pressed on to Cawnpore, which had also recently been retaken. This gave the Company forces a continuous, although still tenuous, line of communication from the east to the west of India.

=== Cawnpore (Kanpur) ===


In June, sepoys under General Wheeler in Cawnpore (now Kanpur) rebelled and besieged the British entrenchment. Wheeler was not only a veteran and respected soldier but also married to an Indian woman. He had relied on his own prestige and his cordial relations with local landholder and hereditary prime minister Nana Sahib to thwart rebellion, and took comparatively few measures to prepare fortifications and lay in supplies and ammunition.
Advised by his trusted consultant Azimullah Khan, Nana Sahib led the rebels at Kanpur rather than join the Mughals in Delhi. The besieged endured three weeks of the Siege of Cawnpore with little water or food, suffering continuous casualties among men, women and children. On 25 June Nana Sahib made an offer of safe passage to Allahabad. With barely three days&#x27; food rations remaining, the British agreed, provided they could keep their small arms and that the evacuation should take place in daylight on the morning of the 27th (the Nana Sahib wanted the evacuation to take place on the night of the 26th). Early in the morning of 27 June, the British party left their entrenchment and made their way to the river where boats provided by the Nana Sahib were waiting to take them to Allahabad. Several sepoys who had stayed loyal to the company were removed by the mutineers and killed, either because of their loyalty or because &quot;they had become Christian&quot;. A few injured British officers trailing the column were also apparently hacked to death by angry sepoys. After the British party had largely arrived at the dock, which was surrounded by sepoys positioned on both banks of the Ganges, with clear lines of fire, firing broke out and the boats were abandoned by their crew, and caught or were set on fire using pieces of red-hot charcoal. The British party tried to push the boats off but all except three remained stuck. One boat with over a dozen wounded men initially escaped, but later grounded, was caught by mutineers and pushed back down the river towards the carnage at Cawnpore. Towards the end, rebel cavalry rode into the water to finish off any survivors. After the firing ceased the survivors were rounded up and the men shot. By the time the massacre was over, most of the male members of the party were dead while the surviving women and children were removed and held hostage to be later killed in the Bibighar massacre. Only four men eventually escaped alive from Cawnpore on one of the boats: two private soldiers, a lieutenant, and Captain Mowbray Thomson, who wrote a first-hand account of his experiences entitled &quot;The Story of Cawnpore&quot; (London, 1859).

During his trial, Tatya Tope denied the existence of any such plan and described the incident in the following terms: the British had already boarded the boats and Tatya Tope raised his right hand to signal their departure. That very moment someone from the crowd blew a loud bugle, which created disorder and in the ongoing bewilderment, the boatmen jumped off the boats. The rebels started shooting indiscriminately. Nana Sahib, who was staying in Savada Kothi (Bungalow) nearby, was informed about what was happening and immediately came to stop it. Some British histories allow that it might well have been the result of accident or error; someone accidentally or maliciously fired a shot, the panic-stricken British opened fire, and it became impossible to stop the massacre.

The surviving women and children were taken to Nana Sahib and then confined first to the Savada Kothi and then to the home of the local magistrate&#x27;s clerk (the Bibighar) where they were joined by refugees from Fatehgarh. Overall, five men and 206 women and children were confined in the Bibigarh for about two weeks. In one week 25 were brought out, dead from dysentery and cholera. Meanwhile, a Company relief force that had advanced from Allahabad defeated the Indians and by 15 July it was clear that Nana Sahib would not be able to hold Cawnpore and a decision was made by Nana Sahib and other leading rebels that the hostages must be killed. After the sepoys refused to carry out this order, two Muslim butchers, two Hindu peasants and one of Nana&#x27;s bodyguards went into the Bibigarh. Armed with knives and hatchets, they murdered the women and children. After the massacre, the walls were covered in bloody handprints, and the floor littered with parts of human limbs. The dead and the dying were thrown down a nearby well. When the deep well was filled with remains to within of the top, the remainder were thrown into the Ganges.

Historians have given many reasons for this act of cruelty. With Company forces approaching Cawnpore, some believed that they would not advance if there were no hostages to save. Or perhaps it was to ensure that no information was leaked after the fall of Cawnpore. Other historians have suggested that the killings were an attempt to undermine Nana Sahib&#x27;s relationship with the British. Perhaps it was due to fear, the fear of being recognised by some of the prisoners for having taken part in the earlier firings.


The killing of the women and children hardened British attitudes against the sepoys. The British public was aghast, and the anti-Imperial and pro-Indian proponents lost all of their support. Cawnpore became a war cry for the British and their allies for the rest of the conflict. Nana Sahib disappeared near the end of the rebellion, and it is not known what happened to him.

Other British accounts state that indiscriminate punitive measures were taken in early June, two weeks before the murders at the Bibighar (but after those at both Meerut and Delhi), specifically by Lieutenant Colonel James George Smith Neill of the Madras Fusiliers, commanding at Allahabad, while moving towards Cawnpore. At the nearby town of Fatehpur, a mob had attacked and murdered the local British population. On this pretext, Neill ordered all villages beside the Grand Trunk Road to be burned and their inhabitants to be hanged. Neill&#x27;s methods were &quot;ruthless and horrible&quot;, and far from intimidating the population, may well have induced previously undecided sepoys and communities to revolt.

Neill was killed in action at Lucknow on 26 September and was never called to account for his punitive measures, though contemporary British sources lionised him and his &quot;gallant blue caps&quot;. When the British retook Cawnpore, the soldiers took their sepoy prisoners to the Bibighar and forced them to lick the bloodstains from the walls and floor. They then hanged or &quot;blew from the cannon&quot;, the traditional Mughal punishment for mutiny, the majority of the sepoy prisoners. Although some claimed the sepoys took no actual part in the killings themselves, they did not act to stop it and this was acknowledged by Captain Thompson after the British departed Cawnpore for a second time.

=== Lucknow ===

Very soon after the events at Meerut, rebellion erupted in the state of Awadh (also known as Oudh, in modern-day Uttar Pradesh), which had been annexed barely a year before. The British Commissioner resident at Lucknow, Sir Henry Lawrence, had enough time to fortify his position inside the Residency compound. The defenders, including loyal sepoys, numbered some 1700 men. The rebels&#x27; assaults were unsuccessful, so they began a barrage of artillery and musket fire into the compound. Lawrence was one of the first casualties. He was succeeded by John Eardley Inglis. The rebels tried to breach the walls with explosives and bypass them via tunnels that led to underground close combat. After 90 days of siege, the defenders were reduced to 300 loyal sepoys, 350 British soldiers and 550 non-combatants.

On 25 September, a relief column under the command of Sir Henry Havelock and accompanied by Sir James Outram (who in theory was his superior) fought its way from Cawnpore to Lucknow in a brief campaign, in which the numerically small column defeated rebel forces in a series of increasingly large battles. This became known as &#x27;The First Relief of Lucknow&#x27;, as this force was not strong enough to break the siege or extricate themselves, and so was forced to join the garrison. In October, another larger army under the new Commander-in-Chief, Sir Colin Campbell, was finally able to relieve the garrison and on 18 November, they evacuated the defended enclave within the city, the women and children leaving first. They then conducted an orderly withdrawal, firstly to Alambagh north where a force of 4,000 were left to construct a fort, then to Cawnpore, where they defeated an attempt by Tantia Tope to recapture the city in the Second Battle of Cawnpore.
In March 1858, Campbell once again advanced on Lucknow with a large army, meeting up with the force at Alambagh, this time seeking to suppress the rebellion in Awadh. He was aided by a large Nepalese contingent advancing from the north under Jung Bahadur Kunwar Rana. General Dhir Shamsher Kunwar Rana, the youngest brother of Jung Bahadur, also led the Nepalese forces in various parts of India including Lucknow, Benares and Patna. Campbell&#x27;s advance was slow and methodical, with a force under General Outram crossing the river on cask bridges on 4 March to enable them to fire artillery in flank. Campbell drove the large but disorganised rebel army from Lucknow with the final fighting taking place on 21 March. There were few casualties to Campbell&#x27;s own troops, but his cautious movements allowed large numbers of the rebels to disperse into Awadh. Campbell was forced to spend the summer and autumn dealing with scattered pockets of resistance while losing men to heat, disease and guerrilla actions.

=== Jhansi ===

Jhansi State was a Maratha-ruled princely state in Bundelkhand. When the Raja of Jhansi died without a biological male heir in 1853, it was annexed to the British Raj by the Governor-General of India under the doctrine of lapse. His widow Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi, protested against the denial of rights of their adopted son. When war broke out, Jhansi quickly became a centre of the rebellion. A small group of Company officials and their families took refuge in Jhansi Fort, and the Rani negotiated their evacuation. However, when they left the fort they were massacred by the rebels over whom the Rani had no control; the British suspected the Rani of complicity, despite her repeated denials.

By the end of June 1857, the company had lost control of much of Bundelkhand and eastern Rajputana. The Bengal Army units in the area, having rebelled, marched to take part in the battles for Delhi and Cawnpore. The many princely states that made up this area began warring amongst themselves. In September and October 1857, the Rani led the successful defence of Jhansi against the invading armies of the neighbouring rajas of Datia and Orchha.

On 3 February, Sir Hugh Rose broke the 3-month siege of Saugor. Thousands of local villagers welcomed him as a liberator, freeing them from rebel occupation.

In March 1858, the Central India Field Force, led by Sir Hugh Rose, advanced on and laid siege to Jhansi. The Company forces captured the city, but the Rani fled in disguise.

After being driven from Jhansi and Kalpi, on 1 June 1858 Rani Lakshmi Bai and a group of Maratha rebels captured the fortress city of Gwalior from the Scindia rulers, who were British allies. This might have reinvigorated the rebellion, but the Central India Field Force very quickly advanced against the city. The Rani died on 17 June, the second day of the Battle of Gwalior, probably killed by a carbine shot from the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars according to the account of three independent Indian representatives. The Company forces recaptured Gwalior within the next three days. In descriptions of the scene of her last battle, she was compared to Joan of Arc by some commentators.

==== Indore ====
Colonel Henry Marion Durand, the then-Company resident at Indore, had brushed away any possibility of uprising in Indore. However, on 1 July, sepoys in Holkar&#x27;s army revolted and opened fire on the cavalry pickets of the Bhopal Contingent (a locally raised force with British officers). When Colonel Travers rode forward to charge, the Bhopal Cavalry refused to follow. The Bhopal Infantry also refused orders and instead levelled their guns at British sergeants and officers. Since all possibility of mounting an effective deterrent was lost, Durand decided to gather up all the British residents and escape, although 39 British residents of Indore were killed.

=== Bihar ===

The rebellion in Bihar was mainly concentrated in the Western regions of the state; however, there were also some outbreaks of plundering and looting in Gaya district.
One of the central figures was Kunwar Singh, the 80-year-old Rajput Zamindar of Jagdishpur, whose estate was in the process of being sequestrated by the Revenue Board, instigated and assumed the leadership of revolt in Bihar. His efforts were supported by his brother Babu Amar Singh and his commander-in-chief Hare Krishna Singh.

On 25 July, mutiny erupted in the garrisons of Danapur. Mutinying sepoys from the 7th, 8th and 40th regiments of Bengal Native Infantry quickly moved towards the city of Arrah and were joined by Kunwar Singh and his men. Mr. Boyle, a British railway engineer in Arrah, had already prepared an outbuilding on his property for defence against such attacks. As the rebels approached Arrah, all British residents took refuge at Mr. Boyle&#x27;s house. A siege soon ensued – eighteen civilians and 50 loyal sepoys from the Bengal Military Police Battalion under the command of Herwald Wake, the local magistrate, defended the house against artillery and musketry fire from an estimated 2000 to 3000 mutineers and rebels.

On 29 July 400 men were sent out from Danapur to relieve Arrah, but this force was ambushed by the rebels around a mile away from the siege house, severely defeated, and driven back. On 30 July, Major Vincent Eyre, who was going up the river with his troops and guns, reached Buxar and heard about the siege. He immediately disembarked his guns and troops (the 5th Fusiliers) and started marching towards Arrah, disregarding direct orders not to do so. On 2 August, some short of Arrah, the Major was ambushed by the mutineers and rebels. After an intense fight, the 5th Fusiliers charged and stormed the rebel positions successfully. On 3 August, Major Eyre and his men reached the siege house and successfully ended the siege.

After receiving reinforcements, Major Eyre pursued Kunwar Singh to his palace in Jagdispur; however, Singh had left by the time Eyre&#x27;s forces arrived. Eyre then proceeded to destroy the palace and the homes of Singh&#x27;s brothers.

In addition to Kunwar Singh&#x27;s efforts, there were also rebellions carried out by Hussain Baksh Khan, Ghulam Ali Khan and Fateh Singh among others in Gaya, Nawada and Jehanabad districts.

In Barkagarh Estate of South Bihar (now in Jharkhand), a major rebellion was led by Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo who was part of the Nagavanshi dynasty. He was motivated by disputes he had with the Christian Kol tribals who had been grabbing his land and were implicitly supported by the British authorities. The rebels in South Bihar asked him to lead them and he readily accepted this offer. He organised a &quot;Mukti Vahini&quot; (Liberation Regiment) with the assistance of nearby zamindars including Pandey Ganpat Rai and Nadir Ali Khan.

=== Other regions ===
==== Punjab and Afghan Frontier ====

What was then referred to by the British as the Punjab was a very large administrative division, centred on Lahore. It included not only the present-day Indian and Pakistani Punjabi regions but also the North West Frontier districts bordering Afghanistan.

Much of the region had been the Sikh Empire, ruled by Ranjit Singh until his death in 1839. The empire had then fallen into disorder, with court factions and the Khalsa (Orthodox Sikhs) contending for power at the Lahore Durbar (court). After two Anglo-Sikh Wars, the entire region was annexed by the East India Company in 1849. In 1857, the region still contained the highest numbers of both British and Indian troops.

The inhabitants of the Punjab were not as sympathetic to the sepoys as they were elsewhere in India, which limited many of the outbreaks in the Punjab to disjointed uprisings by regiments of sepoys isolated from each other. In some garrisons, notably Ferozepore, indecision on the part of the senior British officers allowed the sepoys to rebel, but the sepoys then left the area, mostly heading for Delhi. At the most important garrison, that of Peshawar close to the Afghan frontier, many comparatively junior officers ignored their nominal commander, General Reed, and took decisive action. They intercepted the sepoys&#x27; mail, thus preventing their coordinating an uprising, and formed a force known as the &quot;Punjab Movable Column&quot; to move rapidly to suppress any revolts as they occurred. When it became clear from the intercepted correspondence that some of the sepoys at Peshawar were on the point of open revolt, the four most disaffected Bengal Native regiments were disarmed by the two British infantry regiments in the cantonment, backed by artillery, on 22 May. This decisive act induced many local chieftains to side with the British.

Jhelum in Punjab saw a mutiny of native troops against the British. Here 35 British soldiers of Her Majesty&#x27;s 24th Regiment of Foot (South Wales Borderers) were killed by mutineers on 7 July 1857. Among the dead was Captain Francis Spring, the eldest son of Colonel William Spring. To commemorate this event St. John&#x27;s Church Jhelum was built and the names of those 35 British soldiers are carved on a marble lectern present in that church.

The final large-scale military uprising in the Punjab took place on 9 July, when most of a brigade of sepoys at Sialkot rebelled and began to move to Delhi. They were intercepted by John Nicholson with an equal British force as they tried to cross the Ravi River. After fighting steadily but unsuccessfully for several hours, the sepoys tried to fall back across the river but became trapped on an island. Three days later, Nicholson annihilated the 1,100 trapped sepoys in the Battle of Trimmu Ghat.

The British had been recruiting irregular units from Sikh and Pashtun communities even before the first unrest among the Bengal units, and the numbers of these were greatly increased during the rebellion, 34,000 fresh levies eventually being pressed into service.

At one stage, faced with the need to send troops to reinforce the besiegers of Delhi, the Commissioner of the Punjab (Sir John Lawrence) suggested handing the coveted prize of Peshawar to Dost Mohammad Khan of Afghanistan in return for a pledge of friendship. The British agents in Peshawar and the adjacent districts were horrified. Referring to the massacre of a retreating British Army in 1842, Herbert Edwardes wrote, &quot;Dost Mahomed would not be a mortal Afghan ... if he did not assume our day to be gone in India and follow after us as an enemy. British cannot retreat – Kabul would come again.&quot; In the event Lord Canning insisted on Peshawar being held, and Dost Mohammad, whose relations with Britain had been equivocal for over 20 years, remained neutral.

In September 1858 Rai Ahmad Khan Kharal, head of the Kharal tribe, led an insurrection in the Neeli Bar district, between the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers. The rebels held the forests of Gogaira and had some initial successes against the British forces in the area, besieging Major Crawford Chamberlain at Chichawatni. A squadron of Punjabi cavalry sent by Sir John Lawrence raised the siege. Ahmed Khan was killed but the insurgents found a new leader in Mahr Bahawal Fatyana, who maintained the uprising for three months until Government forces penetrated the jungle and scattered the rebel tribesmen.

==== Bengal and Tripura ====
In September 1857, sepoys took control of the treasury in Chittagong. The treasury remained under rebel control for several days. Further mutinies on 18 November saw the 2nd, 3rd and 4th companies of the 34th Bengal Infantry Regiment storming the Chittagong Jail and releasing all prisoners. The mutineers were eventually suppressed by the Gurkha regiments. The mutiny also spread to Kolkata and later Dhaka, the former Mughal capital of Bengal. Residents in the city&#x27;s Lalbagh area were kept awake at night by the rebellion. Sepoys joined hands with the common populace in Jalpaiguri to take control of the city&#x27;s cantonment. In January 1858, many sepoys received shelter from the royal family of the princely state of Hill Tippera.

The interior areas of Bengal proper were already experiencing growing resistance to Company rule due to the Muslim Faraizi movement.

==== Gujarat ====
In central and north Gujarat, the rebellion was sustained by landowner jagirdars, taluqdar and thakurs with the support of armed communities of Bhil, Koli, Pathans and Arabs, unlike the mutiny by sepoys in north India. Their main opposition of British was due to Inam commission. The Bet Dwarka island, along with Okhamandal region of Kathiawar peninsula which was under the Gaekwad of Baroda State, saw a revolt by the Waghers in January 1858 who, by July 1859, controlled that region. In October 1859, a joint offensive by British, Gaekwad and other princely states troops ousted the rebels and recaptured the region.

==== Orissa ====
During the rebellion, Surendra Sai was one of the many people broken out of Hazaribagh jail by mutineers. In the middle of September Surendra established himself in Sambalpur&#x27;s old fort. He quickly organised a meeting with the Assistant Commissioner (Captain Leigh), and Leigh agreed to ask the government to cancel his and his brother&#x27;s imprisonment while Surendra dispersed his followers. This agreement was soon broken, however, when on 31 September escaped the town and make for Khinda, where his brother was located with a 1,400-man force. The British quickly moved to send two companies from the 40th Madras Native Infantry from Cuttack on 10 October, and after a forced march reached Khinda on 5 November, only to find the place abandoned as the rebels retreated to the jungle. Much of the country of Sambalpur was under the rebels&#x27; control, and they maintained a hit and run guerrilla war for quite some time. In December the British made further preparations to crush the uprising in Sambalpur, and it was temporarily transferred from the Chota Nagpur Division into the Orissa Division of the Bengal Presidency. On the 30th a major battle was fought in which Surendra&#x27;s brother was killed and the mutineers were routed. In January the British achieved minor successes, capturing a few major villages like Kolabira, and in February calm began to be restored. However, Surendra still held out, and the jungle hampered British parties from capturing him. Additionally, any native daring to collaborate with the British were terrorized along with their family. After a new policy that promised amnesty for mutineers, Surendra surrendered in May 1862.

=== British Empire ===
The authorities in British colonies with an Indian population, sepoy or civilian, took measures to secure themselves against copycat uprisings. In the Straits Settlements and Trinidad the annual Hosay processions were banned, riots broke out in penal settlements in Burma and the Settlements, in Penang the loss of a musket provoked a near riot, and security was boosted especially in locations with an Indian convict population.

== Consequences ==
=== Death toll and atrocities ===
Both sides committed atrocities against civilians.

In Oudh alone, some estimates put the toll at 150,000 Indians killed during the war, with 100,000 of them being civilians. The capture of Delhi, Allahabad, Kanpur and Lucknow by British forces were followed by general massacres.

Another notable atrocity was carried out by General Neill who massacred thousands of Indian mutineers and Indian civilians suspected of supporting the rebellion.

The rebels&#x27; murder of British women, children and wounded soldiers (including sepoys who sided with the British) at Cawnpore, and the subsequent printing of the events in the British papers, left many British soldiers outraged and seeking revenge. Aside from hanging mutineers, the British had some &quot;blown from cannon&quot;, (an old Mughal punishment adopted many years before in India), in which sentenced rebels were tied over the mouths of cannons and blown to pieces when the cannons were fired. A particular act of cruelty on behalf of the British troops at Cawnpore included forcing many Muslim or Hindu rebels to eat pork or beef, as well as licking buildings freshly stained with blood of the dead before subsequent public hangings.

Practices of torture included &quot;searing with hot irons...dipping in wells and rivers till the victim is half suffocated... squeezing the testicles...putting pepper and red chillies in the eyes or introducing them into the private parts of men and women...prevention of sleep...nipping the flesh with pinners...suspension from the branches of a tree...imprisonment in a room used for storing lime...&quot;

British soldiers also committed sexual violence against Indian women as a form of retaliation against the rebellion. As towns and cities were captured from the sepoys, the British soldiers took their revenge on Indian civilians by committing atrocities and rapes against Indian women.

Most of the British press, outraged by the stories of alleged rape committed by the rebels against British women, as well as the killings of British civilians and wounded British soldiers, did not advocate clemency of any kind towards the Indian population. Governor General Canning ordered moderation in dealing with native sensibilities and earned the scornful sobriquet &quot;Clemency Canning&quot; from the press and later parts of the British public.

In terms of sheer numbers, the casualties were much higher on the Indian side. A letter published after the fall of Delhi in the &quot;Bombay Telegraph&quot; and reproduced in the British press testified to the scale of the Indian casualties:


From the end of 1857, the British had begun to gain ground again. Lucknow was retaken in March 1858. On 8 July 1858, a peace treaty was signed, and the rebellion ended. The last rebels were defeated in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. By 1859, rebel leaders Bakht Khan and Nana Sahib had either been slain or had fled.

Edward Vibart, a 19-year-old officer whose parents, younger brothers, and two of his sisters had died in the Cawnpore massacre, recorded his experience:


Some British troops adopted a policy of &quot;no prisoners&quot;. One officer, Thomas Lowe, remembered how on one occasion his unit had taken 76 prisoners – they were just too tired to carry on killing and needed a rest, he recalled. Later, after a quick trial, the prisoners were lined up with a British soldier standing a couple of yards in front of them. On the order &quot;fire&quot;, they were all simultaneously shot, &quot;swept... from their earthly existence&quot;.

The aftermath of the rebellion has been the focus of new work using Indian sources and population studies. In &quot;The Last Mughal&quot;, historian William Dalrymple examines the effects on the Muslim population of Delhi after the city was retaken by the British and finds that intellectual and economic control of the city shifted from Muslim to Hindu hands because the British, at that time, saw an Islamic hand behind the mutiny.

Approximately 6,000 of the 40,000 British living in India were killed.

=== Reaction in Britain ===
The scale of the punishments handed out by the British &quot;Army of Retribution&quot; was considered largely appropriate and justified in a Britain shocked by embellished reports of atrocities carried out against British troops and civilians by the rebels. Accounts of the time frequently reach the &quot;hyperbolic register&quot;, according to Christopher Herbert, especially in the often-repeated claim that the &quot;Red Year&quot; of 1857 marked &quot;a terrible break&quot; in British experience. Such was the atmosphere – a national &quot;mood of retribution and despair&quot; that led to &quot;almost universal approval&quot; of the measures taken to pacify the revolt.

Incidents of rape allegedly committed by Indian rebels against British women and girls appalled the British public. These atrocities were often used to justify the British reaction to the rebellion. British newspapers printed various eyewitness accounts of the rape of English women and girls. One such account was published by &quot;The Times&quot;, regarding an incident where 48 English girls as young as 10 had been raped by Indian rebels in Delhi. Karl Marx criticized this story as false propaganda, and pointed out that the story was written by a clergyman in Bangalore, far from the events of the rebellion, with no evidence to support his allegation. Individual incidents captured the public&#x27;s interest and were heavily reported by the press. One such incident was that of General Wheeler&#x27;s daughter Margaret being forced to live as her captor&#x27;s concubine, though this was reported to the Victorian public as Margaret killing her rapist then herself. Another version of the story suggested that Margaret had been killed after her abductor had argued with his wife over her.

During the aftermath of the rebellion, a series of exhaustive investigations were carried out by British police and intelligence officials into reports that British women prisoners had been &quot;dishonoured&quot; at the Bibighar and elsewhere. One such detailed enquiry was at the direction of Lord Canning. The consensus was that there was no convincing evidence of such crimes having been committed, although numbers of British women and children had been killed outright.

The term &#x27;Sepoy&#x27; or &#x27;Sepoyism&#x27; became a derogatory term for nationalists, especially in Ireland.

=== Reorganisation ===


Bahadur Shah II was arrested at Humayun&#x27;s Tomb and tried for treason by a military commission assembled at Delhi and exiled to Rangoon where he died in 1862, bringing the Mughal dynasty to an end. In 1877 Queen Victoria took the title of Empress of India on the advice of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.

The rebellion saw the end of the East India Company&#x27;s rule in India. In August, by the Government of India Act 1858, the company&#x27;s ruling powers over India were transferred to the British Crown. A new British government department, the India Office, was created to handle the governance of India, and its head, the Secretary of State for India, was entrusted with formulating Indian policy. The Governor-General of India gained a new title, Viceroy of India, and implemented the policies devised by the India Office. Some former East India Company territories, such as the Straits Settlements, became colonies in their own right. The British colonial administration embarked on a program of reform, trying to integrate Indian higher castes and rulers into the government and abolishing attempts at Westernization. The Viceroy stopped land grabs, decreed religious tolerance and admitted Indians into civil service, albeit mainly as subordinates.

Essentially the old East India Company bureaucracy remained, though there was a major shift in attitudes. In looking for the causes of the Rebellion the authorities alighted on two things: religion and the economy. On religion it was felt that there had been too much interference with indigenous traditions, both Hindu and Muslim. On the economy it was now believed that the previous attempts by the company to introduce free market competition had undermined traditional power structures and bonds of loyalty placing the peasantry at the mercy of merchants and moneylenders. In consequence the new British Raj was constructed in part around a conservative agenda, based on a preservation of tradition and hierarchy.

On a political level it was also felt that the previous lack of consultation between rulers and ruled had been another significant factor in contributing to the uprising. In consequence, Indians were drawn into government at a local level. Though this was on a limited scale a crucial precedent had been set, with the creation of a new &#x27;white collar&#x27; Indian elite, further stimulated by the opening of universities at Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, a result of the Indian Universities Act. So, alongside the values of traditional and ancient India, a new professional middle class was starting to arise, in no way bound by the values of the past. Their ambition can only have been stimulated by Queen Victoria&#x27;s Proclamation of November 1858, in which it is expressly stated, &quot;We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligations of duty which bind us to our other subjects...it is our further will that... our subjects of whatever race or creed, be freely and impartially admitted to offices in our service, the duties of which they may be qualified by their education, ability and integrity, duly to discharge.&quot;

Acting on these sentiments, Lord Ripon, viceroy from 1880 to 1885, extended the powers of local self-government and sought to remove racial practices in the law courts by the Ilbert Bill. But a policy at once liberal and progressive at one turn was reactionary and backward at the next, creating new elites and confirming old attitudes. The Ilbert Bill had the effect only of causing a white mutiny and the end of the prospect of perfect equality before the law. In 1886 measures were adopted to restrict Indian entry into the civil service.

=== Military Reorganisation ===

The Bengal Army dominated the Presidency armies before 1857 and a direct result after the rebellion was the scaling back of the size of the Bengali contingent in the army. The Brahmin presence in the Bengal Army was reduced because of their perceived primary role as mutineers. The British looked for increased recruitment in the Punjab for the Bengal army as a result of the apparent discontent that resulted in the Sepoy conflict.

The rebellion transformed both the native and British armies of British India. Of the 74 regular Bengal Native Infantry regiments in existence at the beginning of 1857, only twelve escaped mutiny or disbandment. All ten of the Bengal Light Cavalry regiments were lost. The old Bengal Army had accordingly almost completely vanished from the order of battle. These troops were replaced by new units recruited from castes hitherto under-utilised by the British and from the minority so-called &quot;Martial Races&quot;, such as the Sikhs and the Gurkhas.

The inefficiencies of the old organisation, which had estranged sepoys from their British officers, were addressed, and the post-1857 units were mainly organised on the &quot;irregular&quot; system. From 1797 until the rebellion of 1857, each regular Bengal Native Infantry regiment had had 22 or 23 British officers, who held every position of authority down to the second-in-command of each company. In irregular units there were fewer British officers, but they associated themselves far more closely with their soldiers, while more responsibility was given to the Indian officers.

The British increased the ratio of British to Indian soldiers within India. From 1861 Indian artillery was replaced by British units, except for a few mountain batteries. The post-rebellion changes formed the basis of the military organisation of British India until the early 20th century.

=== Awards ===
; Victoria Cross
Medals were awarded to members of the British Armed Forces and the British Indian Army during the rebellion. The 182 recipients of the Victoria Cross are listed here.
; Indian Mutiny Medal
290,000 Indian Mutiny Medals were awarded. Clasps were awarded for the Siege of Delhi and the Siege and relief of Lucknow.

; Indian Order of Merit
A military and civilian decoration of British India, the Indian Order of Merit was first introduced by the East India Company in 1837, and was taken over by the Crown in 1858, following the Indian Mutiny of 1857. The Indian Order of Merit was the only gallantry medal available to Native soldiers between 1837 and 1907.

== Nomenclature ==
There is no universally agreed name for the events of this period.

In India and Pakistan, it has been termed as the &quot;War of Independence of 1857&quot; or &quot;First War of Indian Independence&quot; but it is not uncommon to use terms such as the &quot;Revolt of 1857&quot;. The classification of the Rebellion being &quot;First War of Independence&quot; is not without its critics in India. The use of the term &quot;Indian Mutiny&quot; is considered by some Indian politicians as belittling the importance of what happened and therefore reflecting an imperialistic attitude. Others dispute this interpretation.

In the UK and parts of the Commonwealth it is commonly called the &quot;Indian Mutiny&quot;, but terms such as &quot;Great Indian Mutiny&quot;, the &quot;Sepoy Mutiny&quot;, the &quot;Sepoy Rebellion&quot;, the &quot;Sepoy War&quot;, the &quot;Great Mutiny&quot;, the &quot;Rebellion of 1857&quot;, &quot;the Uprising&quot;, the &quot;Mahomedan Rebellion&quot;, and the &quot;Revolt of 1857&quot; have also been used. &quot;The Indian Insurrection&quot; was a name used in the press of the UK and British colonies at the time.

== Historiography ==

Michael Adas (1971) examines the historiography with emphasis on the four major approaches: the Indian nationalist view; the Marxist analysis; the view of the Rebellion as a traditionalist rebellion; and intensive studies of local uprisings. Many of the key primary and secondary sources appear in Biswamoy Pati, ed. &quot;1857 Rebellion&quot;.
Thomas R. Metcalf has stressed the importance of the work by Cambridge professor Eric Stokes (1924–1981), especially Stokes&#x27; &quot;The Peasant and the Raj: Studies in Agrarian Society and Peasant Rebellion in Colonial India&quot; (1978). Metcalf says Stokes undermines the assumption that 1857 was a response to general causes emanating from entire classes of people. Instead, Stokes argues that 1) those Indians who suffered the greatest relative deprivation rebelled and that 2) the decisive factor in precipitating a revolt was the presence of prosperous magnates who supported British rule. Stokes also explores issues of economic development, the nature of privileged landholding, the role of moneylenders, the usefulness of classical rent theory, and, especially, the notion of the &quot;rich peasant&quot;.

To Kim A. Wagner, who has conducted the most recent survey of the literature, modern Indian historiography is yet to move beyond responding to the &quot;prejudice&quot; of colonial accounts. Wagner sees no reason why atrocities committed by Indians should be understated or inflated merely because these things &quot;offend our post-colonial sensibilities&quot;.

Wagner also stresses the importance of William Dalrymple&#x27;s &quot;The Last Mughal: The Fall of a Dynasty, Delhi 1857&quot;. Dalrymple was assisted by Mahmood Farooqui, who translated key Urdu and Shikastah sources and published a selection in &quot;Besieged: Voices from Delhi 1857&quot;. Dalrymple emphasized the role of religion and explored in detail the internal divisions and politico-religious discord amongst the rebels. He did not discover much in the way of proto-nationalism or any of the roots of modern India in the rebellion. Sabbaq Ahmed has looked at the ways in which ideologies of royalism, militarism, and Jihad influenced the behaviour of contending Muslim factions.

Almost from the moment the first sepoys mutinied in Meerut, the nature and the scope of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 has been contested and argued over. Speaking in the House of Commons in July 1857, Benjamin Disraeli labelled it a &#x27;national revolt&#x27; while Lord Palmerston, the Prime Minister, tried to downplay the scope and the significance of the event as a &#x27;mere military mutiny&#x27;. Reflecting this debate, an early historian of the rebellion, Charles Ball, used the word mutiny in his title, but labelled it a &quot;struggle for liberty and independence as a people&quot; in the text. Historians remain divided on whether the rebellion can properly be considered a war of Indian independence or not, although it is popularly considered to be one in India. Arguments against include:
* A united India did not exist at that time in political, cultural, or ethnic terms;
* The rebellion was put down with the help of other Indian soldiers drawn from the Madras Army, the Bombay Army and the Sikh regiments; 80% of the East India Company forces were Indian;
* Many of the local rulers fought amongst themselves rather than uniting against the British;
* Many rebel sepoy regiments disbanded and went home rather than fight;
* Not all of the rebels accepted the return of the Mughals;
* The King of Delhi had no real control over the mutineers;
* The revolt was largely limited to north and central India. Whilst risings occurred elsewhere they had little impact because of their limited nature;
* A number of revolts occurred in areas not under British rule, and against native rulers, often as a result of local internal politics;
* &quot;The revolt was fractured along religious, ethnic and regional lines.
A second school of thought while acknowledging the validity of the above-mentioned arguments opines that this rebellion may indeed be called a war of India&#x27;s independence. The reasons advanced are:
* Even though the rebellion had various causes, most of the rebel sepoys who were able to do so, made their way to Delhi to revive the old Mughal Empire that signified national unity for even the Hindus amongst them;
* There was a widespread popular revolt in many areas such as Oudh, Bundelkhand and Rohilkhand. The rebellion was therefore more than just a military rebellion, and it spanned more than one region;
* The sepoys did not seek to revive small kingdoms in their regions, instead they repeatedly proclaimed a &quot;country-wide rule&quot; of the Mughals and vowed to drive out the British from &quot;India&quot;, as they knew it then. (The sepoys ignored local princes and proclaimed in cities they took over: &quot;Khalq Khuda Ki, Mulk Badshah Ka, Hukm Subahdar Sipahi Bahadur Ka&quot; – &quot;the people belong to God, the country to the Emperor and authority to the Sepoy and Governor&quot;). The objective of driving out &quot;foreigners&quot; from not only one&#x27;s own area but from their conception of the entirety of &quot;India&quot;, signifies a nationalist sentiment;
* The mutineers, although some were recruited from outside Oudh, displayed a common purpose.

== 150th anniversary ==

The Government of India celebrated the year 2007 as the 150th anniversary of &quot;India&#x27;s First War of Independence&quot;. Several books written by Indian authors were released in the anniversary year including Amresh Mishra&#x27;s &quot;War of Civilizations&quot;, a controversial history of the Rebellion of 1857, and &quot;Recalcitrance&quot; by Anurag Kumar, one of the few novels written in English by an Indian based on the events of 1857.

In 2007, a group of retired British soldiers and civilians, some of them descendants of British soldiers who died in the conflict, attempted to visit the site of the Siege of Lucknow. However, fears of violence by Indian demonstrators, supported by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, prevented the British visitors from visiting the site. Despite the protests, Sir Mark Havelock was able to make his way past police to visit the grave of his ancestor, General Henry Havelock.

<text>QuickDraw GX was a replacement for the QuickDraw (QD) 2D graphics engine and Printing Manager inside the classic Mac OS. Its underlying drawing platform was an object oriented, resolution-independent, retained mode system, making it much easier for programmers to perform common tasks (compared to the original QuickDraw). Additionally, GX added various curve-drawing commands that had been lacking from QD, as well as introducing TrueType as its basic font system.

While GX addressed many of the problems that QD had, by the time it was made available, most developers had already developed their own solutions to these problems. GX also suffered from causing a number of incompatibilities in existing programs, notably those that had developed their own QD extensions. This, coupled with opposition from an important fraction of the developer market, especially PostScript owner Adobe, and a lack of communication from Apple about the benefits of GX and why users should adopt it, led to the technology being sidelined.

QuickDraw GX saw little development after its initial release and was formally &quot;killed&quot; with the purchase of NeXT and the eventual adoption of the Quartz imaging model in Mac OS X. Many of its component features lived on and are now standard in the current Macintosh platform; TrueType GX in particular has become a broadly used modern standard in the form of OpenType Variable Fonts.

==History==
===Problems with QuickDraw===
As the 80s wore on, QuickDraw&#x27;s architectural limitations began to impose limits on Apple and third-party developers.
* All of QuickDraw&#x27;s public data structures assume a 16-bit integer coordinate space, with no provision for fractional coordinates.
* Adding new features to QuickDraw was extremely difficult due to lack of data hiding in the API. The central data structure in QuickDraw was the GrafPort, a structure with all of the member variables exposed. Worse, the GrafPort structure was designed to be directly embedded in third-party developer data structures, so Apple could not add new variables. Color QuickDraw, introduced in 1987, was a tremendous kludge on top of the original black and white QuickDraw. This increased the complexity of developing color applications for Macs. For example, QuickDraw could not easily support advanced graphics transformations such as rotations and shears, and introducing new data types such as curves was impossible.

===Creating GX===
GX appears to have started in a roundabout fashion, originally as an outline font system that would be added to the Mac OS. Included in the font rendering engine were a number of generally useful extensions, notably a fixed point coordinate system and a variety of curve drawing commands. The system also included a system for &quot;wrapping&quot; existing PostScript Type 1 fonts into its own internal format, which added bitmap preview versions for quick on-screen rendering. This project later took on an expanded role when Apple and Microsoft agreed to work together to form an alternative to PostScript fonts, which were extremely expensive, creating the TrueType effort based on Apple&#x27;s existing efforts.

Another project, apparently unrelated at first, attempted to address problems with the conversion from QuickDraw into various printer output formats. Whereas developers had earlier been forced to write their own code to convert their QuickDraw on-screen display to PostScript for printing, under the new printer architecture such conversions would be provided by the OS. Additionally the new system was deliberately engineered to be as flexible as possible, supporting not only QD and PS printers, but potentially other standards such as Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s PCL as well. The system also supported &quot;desktop printers&quot; (printers that appeared as icons on the user&#x27;s desktop), a long sought-after feature missing from QD, and added improved printing dialogs and controls.

It is not clear when the projects merged, but this was a common theme in Apple at the time. Middle-managers were involved in an intense for much of the late 1980s and early 1990s, gathering projects together into &quot;über-projects&quot; that contained enough important code to make them &quot;unkillable&quot;. Sadly, this often delayed the projects dramatically; one component running behind schedule forced the entire collection to be delayed so they could be released &quot;complete&quot;. QuickDraw GX was one such victim, and delays and changes of direction in TrueType and other problems greatly delayed the introduction of GX.

Discussions of GX technology started appearing in various trade magazines around 1992, notably Apple&#x27;s own develop. At the time it appeared release was imminent, perhaps late 1992 or early 1993.

===Release and use===
GX was initially released in about January 1994, as a separate package. Version 1.1.1 was bundled with System 7.5 later that year and it was not successful. The package was large enough to strain the memory of most existing Macintosh computers of the era, and arguments like &quot;you can now print to PostScript&quot; were less than impressive considering many existing programs had already added such support. Users and developers generally ignored GX, and a market for the system simply never appeared.

There is an unknown reason for GX&#x27;s failure in the market. For one thing, GX was very large, by itself requiring as much memory as the rest of the OS. Speed was also an issue, limiting it to running only on Macs with a Motorola 68020 or better. Given that the installed Mac base at the time still contained large numbers of 68000 based machines like the Mac Plus, these requirements restricted the number of machines it could run on. When it was first released, one review noted, &quot;QuickDraw GX isn&#x27;t for everyone and requires more RAM than many Macs have to spare.&quot;

Additionally, the API for the system was very large, filling several books. Implementing a GX program was no easy feat, even though the development was supposed to be easier. This was not a problem of the GX architecture itself, but a side effect of the &quot;all-inclusive&quot; nature of the system—a problem most Apple products of the era suffered from (see PowerTalk for instance). As a result, the developer appeal was limited; a lot of effort would be required to use the system in programs, and the resulting application could only run on a subset of the installed base. The number of GX-based (as opposed to GX-&quot;compatible&quot;) programs numbered less than six, including Pixar&#x27;s Typestry and Softpress&#x27;s UniQorn.

Additionally, the change in printing systems presented serious real-world issues. While PostScript printing had never been easy, over the years since the release of the original LaserWriter, developers had built up a library of solutions to common problems. With the change in architecture for GX, most of these stopped working. New &quot;GX drivers&quot; were needed for printers as well, and Apple didn&#x27;t supply drivers for all of their &quot;own&quot; printers, let alone any third-party ones. Printing problems were endemic, and so difficult to fix that users often gave up on the system in frustration.

User uptake of GX was very close to zero, as was the case for most of the new technologies Apple released in the early 1990s. It might have seen widespread use as a part of the Copland project, but Copland never launched. Although Apple continued to state GX was the future of graphics on the Mac, by 1995 it was clear they were no longer &quot;pushing&quot; it, frustrating its supporters.

Mac OS 8 dropped support for the GX printing architecture, though the text management and color management architectures survived. Elements of the text management architecture became part of the TrueType Specification and elements of the color management architecture became part of the International Color Consortium specification. With the advent of Mac OS X, portions of GX live on in Apple Type Services for Unicode Imaging (ATSUI), and in ColorSync, whose file format is identical to the original format developed for GX.

==Description==
===Graphics===
QuickDraw GX is based on an object oriented model in which graphics objects are aware of and responsible for their own state. Unlike QuickDraw, there is no universal &quot;state&quot;, every drawing command can re-construct the state from data stored within it, or various &quot;parent&quot; objects. For instance, a programmer could build a codice_1 object that first sets the color to red, and then draws a square. From that point on the program no longer has to explicitly set the color before drawing, the GX system itself will always correctly set the drawing color when asked to draw a codice_1, and reset it when finished. Since this state was private, and sent to GX if and when needed, GX theoretically allowed the Mac OS to support protected memory, as state was no longer shared directly between the programs and graphics system.

This contrasts strongly with the original QuickDraw, where the programmer was responsible for all state changes. For instance, if one were to draw a redBox and then a series of lines, the lines would also appear in red unless the programmer explicitly changed the color first. The advantage to this approach is that it minimizes the number of commands needed to set state; the programmer can organize drawing to draw groups of similarly styled objects at the same time and thereby save time. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is easy to &quot;forget&quot; to change state and end up causing problems, so easy that programmers often saved and restored the complete state before every drawing command, thereby potentially &quot;lowering&quot; performance.

The drawing state under GX was hierarchical. A default drawing mode was created with every window, as it was under QD, and drawing objects with no other state changes would use these defaults. The programmer could then change state in the objects themselves, as in our codice_1 example, or alternately change the state of all drawing by setting the state in the window object. GX objects could be easily collected into groups, themselves objects, allowing the state to be set for an entire complex object.

One part of the overall drawing state was the codice_4. This was a 3-by-3 matrix which could express arbitrary linear transformations in two dimensions, including perspective distortions. All GX objects had an associated mapping as part of its drawing state, which allowed for things like rotations and translations. Although all of this state was held in the codice_4 for that object, GX also provided &quot;wrapper&quot; commands like &quot;rotate&quot; to make the API simpler to use.

Unlike QuickDraw, QuickDraw GX allowed for fractional coordinates. However, these were fixed-point values, rather than floating-point. At the time GX was being developed (late 1980s to early 1990s), there was still a significant performance penalty in using floating-point arithmetic.

The GX graphics architecture was built around a number of types of objects which were premade, though a full set of API calls was available for examining and manipulating them:
* a gxShape defined the basic geometry of a shape (for example, coordinates of control points for a curve, or the text content of a text object).
* a gxStyle defined elaborations of the basic shape geometry, such as line thickness, cap and join styles, fill pattern and text font.
* a gxInk specified how pixel values were to be computed when rendering the shape: besides specifying a basic color for the shape, this also included an elaborate &quot;transfer mode&quot; structure that could define a wide variety of functions of the initial and final destination pixel value.
* a gxFont represented a font, either one installed for systemwide use, or one installed on-the-fly by the current application for its own use. API calls allowed the interrogation of the properties of a font, including the determination of what encodings (Unicode, language-specific etc.) it might support.
* a gxProfile was a representation of a ColorSync color profile, used as part of the specification of a color for drawing. GX integrated full support for color matching at all stages of the drawing process, as well as support for non-RGB color specifications (such as HSV, YUV and CIE XYZ).
* a gxTransform determined the relationship between the shape and the display device. Besides the Clipping path and the gxMapping that transformed the shape before displaying on the output device, this object also specified hit-testing information that controlled responses to user clicks within the area of the shape.
* a gxViewDevice represented a block of pixel memory into which drawing would be rendered. This could be an actual on-screen display, or an offscreen block of memory. GX supported all the QuickDraw pixel layouts; this allowed both a GX view device and a QuickDraw GrafPort to point to the same pixels, thereby allowing applications to mix both sets of drawing calls.
* a gxViewPort was a logical destination for drawing. A gxTransform could specify a list of more than one of these; the shape would be drawn into all of them in a single codice_6 call.
* a gxViewGroup represented the connection between view devices and view ports. Each view port had a gxMapping specifying its relationship to the global coordinate system of the view group; and each view device had a gxMapping that specified its location and the size of its pixels with regard to view group coordinates. There was a single predefined view group which contained all on-screen view devices (and whose view ports effectively corresponded to on-screen windows); applications were free to create their own view groups for off-screen view devices and view ports.
* a gxTag allowed the attachment of arbitrary application-defined information to most of the above object types. Each tag had an OSType type code, but there could be multiple tags of the same type attached to the same object.

====Shape types====
GX shapes could be of various types:
* a straight line defined by its end points.
* a rectangle defined by its left, right, upper and lower bounds.
* a polygon defined by a sequence of vertex coordinates.
* a &quot;curve&quot; shape was a single quadratic Bézier curve defined by three control points.
* a &quot;path&quot; shape which was a sequence of quadratic Bézier curves. Each control point had an associated flag indicating whether it was &quot;on-curve&quot; or &quot;off-curve&quot;. An on-curve point was a Bézier endpoint, while an off-curve point was a Bézier midpoint. If two successive off-curve points were encountered, then an implicit on-curve point was assumed to lie halfway between them. Two successive on-curve points defined a straight-line segment.
* a &quot;bitmap&quot; shape contained raster data in any of the supported pixel formats.
* a &quot;picture&quot; shape was a grouping of other shapes (possibly including recursive picture shapes), with the option of specifying additional transformations applying to the whole group.
* the various types of &quot;typographic&quot; shapes are described in the GX Typography section below.
* additional types which were perhaps not directly useful for drawing, but could be combined with other shapes in geometry calculations: the &quot;empty&quot; shape (drawing of which did nothing); the &quot;point&quot; shape consisting of a single point; and the &quot;full&quot; shape (of infinite extent).

===Typography===

The typography features of GX were integrated in the form of 3 types of gxShape:
* &quot;Text shapes&quot; were the simplest: these contained a single run of text rendered in a single font style.
* &quot;Glyph shapes&quot; were a way to use character shapes (&quot;glyphs&quot;) as pure geometry, for instance as Clipping paths.
* &quot;Layout shapes&quot; were the most elaborate. These could be divided into multiple runs with different font styles, even different language encodings and text directions. Thus, it was possible to embed a sequence of Arabic text, rendered right-to-left, within an outer sequence of left-to-right Roman text. Layout shapes unleashed the full power of contextual substitutions, kerning, variations and all the other capabilities of TrueType GX fonts. Their main restriction was that they were confined to a single line of text.

The GX API also provided hit-testing functions, so that for example if the user clicked on a layout shape in the middle of a ligature, or in the region between a change of text direction, GX itself would provide the smarts to determine which character position in the original text corresponded to the click.

=== TrueType GX ===
An important distinction in GX was drawn between a character and a glyph, a distinction also found in the Unicode Standard. A &quot;character&quot; was an abstract symbol from the character set of a writing system, such as the letter &quot;f&quot; in the writing systems of the Latin script. Whereas a &quot;glyph&quot; was a specific graphic shape from a particular font, whether the shape represented a single character or a set of characters. Thus, for example, the Hoefler Text font had glyphs to represent the letters &quot;f&quot; and &quot;l&quot;. It also had another glyph to represent the ligature , which could be automatically composed (instead of the individual glyphs) wherever the two abstract characters &quot;f&quot; and &quot;l&quot; occurred in sequence in the source text.

This distinction was important in that such contextual substitutions occurred at rendering time, without any changes to the source character string. Thus they had no impact on editing or searching of the text. PostScript Type 1 font files have one to one mapping only, and as ligatures are many to one mappings, they can not be inserted into the composition without changing the source character string, for instance, the ligature ffi is placed at the position of capital Y in Adobe font products, and &quot;Adobe Offices&quot; is composed by typing &quot;Adobe O&quot; &lt;change font&gt; &quot;Y&quot; &lt;change font&gt; &quot;ces&quot;. In the layout the character string is broken, and in PDF made from streamed PostScript the characters f+f+i can only be reconstructed, if the name of the glyph follows a glyph naming list.

Contextual substitutions can be controlled by enabling or disabling the composition options of a TrueType GX font in WorldText on the Mac OS 9 CD or in TextEdit in Mac OS X. Fonts commonly have features called &quot;common ligatures&quot; (such as the &quot;fl&quot; example), &quot;rare ligatures&quot; (such as inscriptional ME and MD ligatures), &quot;archaic non-terminal s&quot; (for automatically substituting the letter &quot;s&quot; with the archaic form that looked more like an &quot;f&quot;, except at the ends of words), and even choices between entirely separate sets of glyph designs, such as more and less ornate forms.

The rules for performing contextual substitutions are implemented as state machines built into the font, and interpreted by the LLM Line Layout Manager, the counterpart of the CMM Color Management Module for ColorSync services. Text management in the operating system allowed QuickDraw GX to accept character strings with any mix of writing systems and scripts, and compose the strings automatically, whether the encoding was Unicode 1.0 or 8 bit and 8/16 bit encodings.

Another interesting feature was font &quot;variations,&quot; which were the GX equivalent of Adobe&#x27;s &quot;multiple master&quot; fonts. Whereas Adobe&#x27;s fonts required the user explicitly create an &quot;instance&quot; of the font by specifying values for the variation axes before they could use it, GX allowed the user to specify the font directly for a layout style, and then dynamically vary the axis values and immediately observe the effect on the layout of the text.

This technology became the core of what Microsoft and Adobe would adopt in 2016, with its development of OpenType Variable Fonts.

<text>Arak or araq () is a distilled Levantine spirit of the anise drinks family. It is translucent and unsweetened.

==Composition==
Arak is traditionally made of grapes and aniseed (the seeds of the anise plant); when crushed, their oil provides arak with a slight licorice taste. Dates, figs, and other fruits are sometimes added.

Typically, arak is a minimum of 50% alcohol by volume (ABV), and can be up to 70% ABV (126 proof). A 53% ABV is considered typical.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;arak&quot; comes from Arabic &quot;&quot; (, meaning &#x27;perspiration&#x27;). Its pronunciation varies depending on the regional varieties of Arabic, e.g.: or .

== Production and consumption ==
Arak is a traditional alcoholic beverage of the Levant and Eastern Mediterranean. It is distilled and consumed across a wide area in the Middle East, including in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Israel, Iraq and Palestine.

Arak is a stronger flavored liquor, and is usually mixed in proportions of approximately one part arak to two parts water in a traditional Eastern Mediterranean water vessel called an &quot;ibrik&quot; (Arabic: &quot;&quot;) from Middle Persian or Parthian &quot;*ābrēz&quot;. The mixture is then poured into ice-filled cups, usually small, but can also be consumed in regular sized cups. This dilution causes the clear liquor to turn a translucent milky-white color; this is because anethole, the essential oil of anise, is soluble in alcohol but not in water. This results in an emulsion whose fine droplets scatter the light and turn the liquid translucent, a phenomenon known as the ouzo effect.

Arak is often served with meze, which may include dozens of small traditional dishes, as well as with grilled meat. It is also commonly served as an apéritif.

===In Lebanon===
Arak is often called the national drink of Lebanon. Often made from the Marawi and Obaideh grape varieties, a center of production is the Bekaa Valley vineyards, particularly the Kefraya, Ksara, Domaine des Tourelles, and Massaya vineyards. Zahlé, where Arak Zahlawi is produced, is considered a capital of arak. The water used in the production of Arak Zahlawi is traditionally drawn from the Berdawni River.

===In Syria===
In Syria, arak is common. Before the outbreak of the Syria Civil War in 2011, production was dominated by two state-run firms, Al-Rayan (based in the Druze city of Sweida) and Al-Mimas (based in a Christian settlement near Homs). Together, the two companies held about 85% of Syria&#x27;s market share in arak. Since the civil war, however, the companies&#x27; profits and the price of arak, has declined, with their combined market share falling to under half. Low-quality counterfeits also proliferated, using pure alcohol (rather than fermented grapes) and an aniseed substitute (rather than aniseed).

===In Iraq===
Iraq formerly manufactured arak, including in Bashiqa in northern Iraq, but most arak production facilities shut down in the 2010s. Arak is distilled and consumed by Iraq&#x27;s Yazidi and Christian minorities, although many members of these groups fled after ISIL seized control of large portions of northern Iraq in 2014. Amid a rise in Islamic conservatism, the Iraqi parliament passed a ban on the import, manufacture, and sale of alcoholic beverages in 2016, prompting protests from Iraqi non-Muslims and rights activists. The ban was not enforced until it was officially gazetted in 2023, triggering border crackdowns. The ban is not enforced in Iraq&#x27;s autonomous Kurdistan Region.

===In Israel===
During the age of austerity in the early years of the State of Israel, arak was locally made, with few imports. The core market for arak was among older, working-class Israelis, and the drink was disfavored among younger and modern Israelis. In the first two decades of the 21st century, however, arak had a resurgence of popularity in Israel. Arak also continues to be popular among Moroccan Jews in Israel, some of whom regard arak as having folk medicine properties.

Israeli tax reforms in 2013 substantially increased the alcohol tax, and this led to consolidation of the arak market. The most popular producer is Joseph Gold &amp; Sons, a winery established in 1824 in Haifa by the Gold family, which formerly made vodka in Ukraine before establishing an arak distillery in Israel. The winery, which later moved to Tirat Carmel outside Haifa, produces different arak brands, including Elite Arak, Alouf Arak and Amir Arak. Other major arak producers include Barkan Wine Cellars (which produces Arak Ashkelon) and Kawar Distillery (which produces Arak Kawar, Arak Yuda, and Arak Noah). After the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, some former South Lebanon Army members who settled in Israel began to produce arak using Lebanese (Zahle) methods.

===In Palestine===
Arak is locally produced by Palestinian Christians. The West Bank city of Ramallah is a center of arak distillation. Imports of Palestinian arak to the U.S. increased after imports of Syrian arak was disrupted by the Syrian civil war.

===Outside the Levant===
Several arak brands are produced outside of the eastern Mediterranean. The Sudanese araqi is a similar drink. Arak is also produced in north Africa. The Arak Carmel brand is produced in Spain, while the Arak Julenar brand is produced by an Iraqi in Greece.

Arak was once produced in Iran, until it was banned following the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iranian Armenians locally manufacture black-market arak in Iran, and some foreign brands are also smuggled in the country. A locally made Iranian arak moonshine, &quot;aragh sagi&quot;, is made from fermented raisins; in 2020, it sold on the black market for about US$10 for 1.5 liters.

The Persian Empire Distillery, established in 2006 by a Shiraz-born Persian Canadian entrepreneur, distills an arak brand, Arak Saggi, at its distillery in Peterborough, Ontario.

Arak has achieved popularity among consumers in the North Caucasus area of Russia.

===Similar drinks===
Arak is very similar to other anise-based spirits, including the Turkish rakı and the Greek ouzo, the Greek tsikoudia, the Italian sambuca and anisette, the Bulgarian and Macedonian mastika, and the Spanish anis. However, it is unrelated to the similarly named arrack, a sugarcane-based Indonesia liquor.

== Preparation ==
Manufacturing begins with the vineyards, and quality grapevines are the key to making good arak. The vines should be very mature and usually of a golden color. Instead of being irrigated, the vineyards are left to the care of the Mediterranean climate and make use of the natural rain and sun. The grapes, which are harvested in late September and early October, are crushed and put in barrels together with the juice (in Arabic &quot;el romeli&quot;) and left to ferment for three weeks. Occasionally the whole mix is stirred to release the CO2.

Both pot stills and column stills are used. Stills are usually made of stainless steel or copper. Copper stills with a Moorish shape are the most sought after.

The alcohol collected in the first distillation undergoes a second distillation, but this time it is mixed with aniseed. The ratio of alcohol to aniseed may vary and it is one of the major factors in the quality of the final product. The finished product is produced during a final distillation which takes place at the lowest possible temperature. For a quality arak, the finished spirit is then aged in clay amphoras to allow the angel&#x27;s share to evaporate. The liquid remaining after this step is the most suitable for consumption.

<text>Yip Yip Yaphank is a 1918 musical revue by Irving Berlin. He wrote and produced the show during World War I, after he was drafted into the United States Army and was serving in 152nd Depot Brigade at Camp Upton in Yaphank, New York. The military revue was performed by the soldiers of Camp Upton. It moved to Broadway after a brief tryout at the camp.

==From idea to the stage==
The commanding officer at Camp Upton had wanted to build a community building on the grounds of the army base, and thought that Sgt. Berlin could help raise the $35,000 needed for its construction. Berlin&#x27;s song, &quot;Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning,&quot; an everyman song for soldiers, was the basis of a revue full of army recruits—a source of manpower available for him to use. He called his friend and co-worker Harry Ruby to join him in writing down the flurry of songs that Berlin created, including &quot;God Bless America&quot;, which Berlin eventually omitted from the play for being too sticky.

In July 1918, &quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot; had a tryout run at Camp Upton&#x27;s little Liberty Theatre, before moving on to Central Park West&#x27;s Century Theatre in August. The show was typical of revues and follies, featuring acrobatics, dancers, jugglers, and featured a demonstration by Lightweight Boxing Champion Benny Leonard. Included with the performances were military drills choreographed to music by Berlin.

The show had comedy, including males dressed as Ziegfeld girls, and Sgt. Berlin as the reluctant soldier not wanting to join in reveille during the &quot;Oh! How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning&quot; skit.

The finale, &quot;We&#x27;re On Our Way to France&quot;, was the replacement for &quot;God Bless America&quot;. During this act, the whole company wore their full gear, and marched out of the theater, down the aisles and out to the street. During the Century Theatre run, the &quot;performers&quot; stayed at an armory downtown, and usually marched right back to the armory after the evening show.

In September 1918, the production had to move to the Lexington Theatre, where it eventually ended its run. On that night, the audience saw the usual ending, with the battle-ready men marching off to &quot;war&quot; but with a slight diversion. After the main performers marched through the aisles, Sgt. Irving Berlin and the rest of the crew were similarly dressed and marched out of the theater. This time, the men &quot;were&quot; going off to war, actually heading to France.

==After the curtain==
The play earned the U.S. Army $80,000 ($ million in dollars) for Camp Upton&#x27;s Community Building, though the army never had it built. Irving Berlin didn&#x27;t go to France, and was listed among other great songwriters and playwrights of the time, well up to the next great war.

==Songs==

*&quot;You Can&#x27;t Stay Up on Bevo&quot;
*&quot;Oh! How I Hate To Get Up in the Morning&quot;

*&quot;Mandy&quot; (a major song in a blackface minstrel number, later featured in the 1919 edition of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;)
*&quot;We&#x27;re On Our Way to France&quot;
*&quot;The Girl I left Behind&quot;

*&quot;Don&#x27;t Know the Half&quot;
*&quot;Fancy Free&quot;
*&quot;On Our Way to France&quot;
*&quot;God Bless America&quot; - originally written for the play but not included. It was included in the sequel to &quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot;, &quot;This is the Army&quot; in 1943

== Adaptations ==
The first adaptation of Yip Yip Yaphank! after being performed on Broadway was in the 1943 film &quot;This Is the Army&quot;. In this film, the character Jerry Jones is seen preparing to perform Yip Yip Yaphank! with his fellow soldiers. Most of the show is not depicted in this film, but the finale &quot;We&#x27;re On Our Way to France&quot; is performed in the same way it was during the last show at the Lexington Theater in 1918. 

The soldiers are shown marching out of the theater into the streets in full field equipment where they get into military trucks to ship off to war. The film featured Berlin singing &quot;Oh How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning&quot;, as was done in the original 1918 production.

The next adaptation wasn&#x27;t until November 2010, when the show was revisited by American Classics. American Classics is an organization that performs historical musicals and musical revues in the Greater Boston Area. This performance was the first ever revival of Yip Yip Yaphank! and featured all of the original songs from the 1918 production. American Classics performed another revival of the show in 2018 for its 100th anniversary.

In November 2018, &quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot; was performed by the students of Longwood High School, as a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the show&#x27;s debut. The Longwood Central School District services the town of Yaphank where the musical revue was originally performed and conceived. This depiction contained many of the original songs and skits from the original performance. One change made to the show was the reintroduction of the song God Bless America.

Extensive research was done during the production by the producer to correctly portray the intent of Irving Berlin. Producer of the adaptation Dr. John J. Gallagher stated, &quot;A team of teachers joined me at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC for a research project during the summer of 2017. There, we obtained sheet music, some orchestrations and other personal documents from Berlin himself . . . Local historians had donated authentic photos [and] letters from soldiers that have been incorporated into the production.&quot;

<doc id="590264" wikidata="Q3927832" url="?curid=590264" title="QuickDraw 3D">
<text>QuickDraw 3D, or QD3D for short, is a 3D graphics API developed by Apple Inc. (then Apple Computer, Inc.) starting in 1995, originally for their Macintosh computers, but delivered as a cross-platform system.

QD3D was separated into two layers. A lower level system known as RAVE (Rendering Acceleration Virtual Engine) provided a hardware abstraction layer with functionality similar to Direct3D or cut-down versions of OpenGL like MiniGL. On top of this was an object-oriented scene graph system, QD3D proper, which handled model loading and manipulation at a level similar to OpenGL++. The system also supplied a number of high-level utilities for file format conversion, and a standard viewer application for the Mac OS.

QD3D had little impact in the computer market, both as a result of Apple&#x27;s beleaguered position in the mid-1990s, as well as several fateful decisions made by the design team about future changes in the 3D hardware market that did not come true. Apple abandoned work on QD3D after Steve Jobs took over in 1998, and announced that future 3D support on Mac OS would be based on OpenGL.

==OpenGL in the 1990s==
The canonical 3D API of the 1990s was OpenGL. This had been written by SGI and initially closely matched the capabilities of their workstation systems, operating as a hardware abstraction layer. The OpenGL API consisted mostly of state-setting instructions for setting up drawing modes like the paint color or camera position, and system for sending geometry into the system, normally as meshes of triangles. The combination of these instructions was saved into a display list which was then rendered to produce the output.

OpenGL lacked many features that are needed to produce a complete 3D program. Saving and loading geometry data, collecting that data into groups to produce model objects, and the control of state was all left to the programmer. This was considered to be an advantage in an era when performance was limited and direct control over these sorts of functions was a route to improved performance.

However, this lack of high-level functionality did make it more difficult to quickly write simple programs, as well as leading to a lack of interoperability. A number of efforts started to provide standardized higher level APIs, like OpenGL++ and (later) Fahrenheit, which handled many of the more common bookkeeping tasks like loading geometry from files and providing a display. These standardized scene graph systems meant the programmer only had to provide the GUI for the program.

While OpenGL is mostly low-level, it did include some higher-level concepts that were only really used on SGI systems. This led to another series of APIs that removed these features to make it easier to implement on common hardware. The best known of these is MiniGL, which is not a separate API, but simply a list of those functions in OpenGL that are guaranteed to be supported across all hardware, thus ensuring that a program limiting itself to those calls will run with maximum performance.

==QD3D==
QD3D was designed from the start to operate on computers with considerably less power than workstations. This led to a concerted effort to cleanly separate the upper and lower layers of the API, with the lower-level RAVE system being closer to MiniGL from the start. This had the advantage of providing a clean and minimal API that could be more easily ported to different hardware.

Since only RAVE needed to be ported, the upper layer APIs could be made as complex as desired, and the QD3D system included a complete scene graph, a standardized model file format, 3DMF, and even basic GUI objects that utilized them. To write a simple application in QD3D, the programmer only had to include a few libraries and then place the GUI elements in their program using ResEdit or similar tools.

Additional functionality included a &quot;plug-in&quot; rendering system, which allowed an application to render a scene in a variety of styles. Without changing the model or their code, developers could render the same scene interactively or (with suitable plug-ins) using methods such as ray-tracing or phong shading.

The QD3D API was an object-like system based on pure-C code. The various structures were carefully constructed to contain pointers to other important objects. Objects knew all the drawing state they needed, thereby eliminating code that would normally be needed when developing under OpenGL.

On the downside, QD3D&#x27;s layering introduced performance issues. For instance, the system stored and automatically set state for every object before drawing. This made development much easier, but also made the performance drop in a way the developer had no direct control over. Those applications demanding performance over ease of programming could instead choose to use the RAVE layer directly.

Another area of concern is that the scene graph was hidden from view, and considerable improvements in rendering performance can be made by carefully &quot;culling&quot; the graph to remove those objects that are not in view. Although later releases of QD3D gained the ability to automatically perform visibility culling (based on the grouping of objects in the scene graph), OpenGL&#x27;s lack of support for this feature typically forced developers to implement it from the start.

==Switch to OpenGL==
Good low-level 3D performance relies not only on the programmer to provide efficient models, but high-quality drivers for the hardware as well. Although RAVE was designed to be cross-platform, only hardware developers which supported Mac (ATI, NVIDIA, and 3dfx) produced drivers for it. This left any comparison between QD3D and alternative APIs one-sided, as outside of the Mac QD3D was forced to fall back to a software RAVE implementation.

As OpenGL gained traction on Windows (often credited to id Software, who championed the API over D3D), hardware developers were increasingly designing future hardware against the future feature set planned for Microsoft&#x27;s D3D. Through its extension mechanism OpenGL was able to track these changes relatively easily, while RAVE&#x27;s feature set remained relatively fixed.

At the Macworld Expo in January 1999, Apple announced that neither QuickDraw 3D nor RAVE would be included in Mac OS X. The company laid off the development staff in June 1999, replacing the in-house technology with OpenGL after buying a Mac implementation and key staff from Conix Enterprises.

After Apple withdrew support for QD3D, an open source implementation of the QD3D API was developed externally. Known as &quot;Quesa&quot;, this implementation combines QD3D&#x27;s higher level concepts with an OpenGL renderer. As well as cross-platform hardware acceleration, this library also allows the use of the QD3D API on platforms never supported by Apple (such as Linux). The latest update is from 2023.

==Applications==
Among hundreds of applications published employing RAVE are: 
*Graphing Calculator in the 1990s, shipped with every Power Macintosh
*Quake
*Descent II
*Unreal
*Carmageddon 2
*Future Cop: LAPD
*WaterRace
*StrataVision 3D
*Infini-D

<text>The dimo () is a special membrane applied to the transverse Chinese flute called &quot;dizi&quot; (or &quot;di&quot;), giving the instrument its characteristic buzzing timbre.
&quot;Dimo&quot;, made from the tissue-thin membrane from the interior of a specific variety of bamboo, are supplied as tubular sleeves. Only a small rectangle is needed at a time, so for application, a small section is cut off the end of the &quot;di mo&quot; sleeve, and that small tube is cut open to make a rough rectangle of flat membrane.

The Korean transverse bamboo flute called &quot;daegeum&quot; has a similar buzzing membrane. The Korean &quot;sogeum&quot; and &quot;junggeum&quot;, Vietnamese &quot;sáo&quot;, and the Thai &quot;khlui&quot; also once had membranes, but these are not used today.

==Application==
The &quot;di mo&quot; is applied to the membrane hole (or Mo kong) of the dizi using a special, traditional glue called &quot;Ejiao&quot;. One of the advantages of &quot;ejiao&quot; is that the glue is water-soluble, so that it can be wetted again to re-adjust the &quot;di mo&quot;.

After applying the glue around the &quot;mo kong&quot;, the &quot;di mo&quot; is applied, and then adjusted while the glue is still wet so that many creases form in a sequence along the length of the hole. Each crease should be parallel to the one before, crossing the hole horizontally, so that together they form a sort of pleat or corrugation.

If &quot;Ejiao&quot; is not available, a substitute can be improvised by simply crushing garlic into a fine, relatively dry paste, and applying as normal. It should be used quickly.

Although the purpose of applying &quot;di mo&quot; is simply to make the &quot;dizi&quot; operational, the application technique is considered to be an art in itself.

<text>A , or shrine maiden, is a young priestess who works at a Shinto shrine. were once likely seen as shamans, but are understood in modern Japanese culture to be an institutionalized role in daily life, trained to perform tasks, ranging from sacred cleansing to performing the sacred dance.

==Appearance==
The traditional attire of a is a pair of red (divided, pleated trousers), a white (a predecessor of the kimono), and some white or red hair ribbons. In Shinto, the color white symbolizes purity. The garment put over the during dances is called a .

Traditional tools include the , the (offertory -tree branches), and the .

 also use bells, drums, candles, , and bowls of rice in ceremonies.

==Definition==


The Japanese words and (&quot;female shaman&quot; and &quot;shrine maiden&quot; respectively) are usually written as a compound of the kanji (&quot;shaman&quot;), and (&quot;woman&quot;). was archaically written (&quot;kami&quot; + &quot;child&quot;) and (&quot;shaman child&quot;).

The term is not to be confused with meaning &quot;prince&quot;, &quot;princess&quot; or &quot;duke&quot;, and which is otherwise variously spelt (&quot;august child&quot;), (&quot;imperial child&quot;), (&quot;imperial daughter&quot;, also pronounced ), (&quot;prince&quot;) or (&quot;king&quot;, &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;duke&quot;). These spellings of were commonly used in the titles of ancient Japanese nobles, such as Prince Kusakabe (, or ).

 once performed spirit possession and (whereby the possessed person serves as a &quot;medium&quot; () to communicate the divine will or message of that  or spirit; also included in the category of is &quot;dream revelation&quot; (), in which a appears in a dream to communicate its will) as vocational functions in their service to shrines. As time passed, they left the shrines and began working independently in secular society. In addition to a medium or a (or a , a male shaman), the site of a may occasionally also be attended by a who interprets the words of the possessed person to make them comprehensible to other people present. and may be passive, when a person speaks after suddenly becoming involuntarily possessed or has a dream revelation; they can also be active, when spirit possession is induced in a specific person to ascertain the divine will or gain a divine revelation.

 are known by many names; Fairchild lists 26 terms for &quot;shrine-attached &quot; and 43 for &quot;non-shrine-attached &quot;. Other names are , or (both likely meaning &quot;female medium; fortuneteller&quot;), and .

In English, the word is often translated as &quot;shrine maiden&quot;, though freer renderings often simply use the phrase &quot;female shaman&quot; () or, as Lafcadio Hearn translated it, &quot;Divineress&quot;. Some scholars prefer the transliteration , contrasting the Japanese Mikoism with other Asian terms for female shamans. As Fairchild explains:

The word can also mean &quot;shrine virgin&quot;.

==Mikoism==
===History===
 traditions date back to the prehistoric Jōmon period of Japan, when female shamans would go into &quot;trances and convey the words of the gods&quot; (the ), an act comparable with &quot;the pythia or sibyl in Ancient Greece.&quot;

The earliest record of anything resembling the term is of the Chinese reference to Himiko, Japan&#x27;s earliest substantiated historical reference (not legendary); however, it is completely unknown whether Himiko was a , or even if existed in those days.

The early were important social figures who were &quot;associated with the ruling class&quot;. &quot;In addition to her ritual performances of ecstatic trance&quot;, writes Kuly, &quot;[the ] performed a variety of religious and political functions&quot;. One traditional school of , Kuly adds, &quot;claimed to descend from the Goddess Uzume&quot;.

During the Nara period (710–794) and Heian period (794–1185), government officials tried to control practices. As Fairchild notes:

In 780 A.D. and in 807 A.D. official bulls against the practice of ecstasy outside of the authority of the shrines were published. These bulls were not only aimed at ecstasy, but were aimed at magicians, priests, sorcerers, etc. It was an attempt to gain complete control, while at the same time it aimed at eradicating abuses which were occurring.

During the feudal Kamakura period (1185–1333) when Japan was controlled by warring states:

[T]he was forced into a state of mendicancy as the shrines and temples that provided her with a livelihood fell into bankruptcy. Disassociated from a religious context, her performance moved further away from a religious milieu and more toward one of a non-ecclesiastical nature. The travelling , known as the , became associated with prostitution. ... [T]he &#x27;s stature as a woman close to the diminished as a patriarchal, militaristic society took over.

During the Edo period (1603–1868), writes Groemer, &quot;the organizational structures and arts practiced by female shamans in eastern Japan underwent significant transformations&quot;. Though in the Meiji period (1868–1912), many shamanistic practices were outlawed:

After 1867 the Meiji government&#x27;s desire to create a form of state Shinto headed by the emperor—the shaman-in-chief of the nation—meant that Shinto needed to be segregated from both Buddhism and folk-religious beliefs. As a result, official discourse increasingly repeated negative views of Miko and their institutions.

There was an edict called enforced by security forces loyal to Imperial forces, forbidding all spiritual practices by , issued in 1873, by the .

The Shinto dance ceremony, which originated with &quot;ritual dancing to convey divine oracles&quot;, has been transformed in the 20th century into a popular ceremonial dance called or .

===Traditional training===

The position of a shaman passed from generation to generation, but sometimes someone not directly descended from a shaman went voluntarily into training or was appointed by the village chieftains. To achieve this, such a person had to have some potential.

To become a shaman, the girl (still at a young age, mostly after the start of the menstruation cycle) had to undergo very intensive training specific to the . An acknowledged elder shaman, who could be a family member (like an aunt) or a member of the tribe, would teach the girl in training the techniques required to be in control of her trance state. This would be done by rituals including washings with cold water, regular purifying, abstinence and the observation of the common taboos like death, illness and blood. She would also study how to communicate with and spirits of the deceased, as a medium, by being possessed by those spirits. This was achieved by chanting and dancing, thus therefore the girl was taught melodies and intonations that were used in songs, prayers and magical formulas, supported by drum and rattlers.

Other attributes used for rituals were mirrors (to attract the ) and swords (katana). She also needed the knowledge of the several names of the that were important for her village, as well as their function. Finally she learned a secret language, only known by insiders (other shamans of the tribe) and so discovered the secrets of fortune-telling and magical formulas.

After the training, which could take three to seven years, the girl would get her initiation rite to become a real shaman. This mystic ceremony was witnessed by her mentor, other elders and fellow shamans. The girl wore a white shroud as a symbol for the end of her previous life. The elders began chanting and after a while the girl started to shiver. Next, her mentor would ask the girl which had possessed her and therefore be the one she would serve. As soon as she answered, the mentor would throw a rice cake into her face, causing the girl to faint. The elders would bring the girl to a warm bed and keep her warm until she woke up. When the whole ordeal was over and the girl had woken up, she was permitted to wear a coloured wedding dress and perform the corresponding tradition of the wedding toast.

The resemblance of a wedding ceremony as the initiation rite suggests that the trainee, still a virgin, had become the bride of the she served (called a ). During her trance, said had requested the girl to his shrine. In some areas of Japan she had to bring a pot filled with rice () and a pan. An old, long-abandoned practice saw engage in sexual intercourse with a , who would represent the . Any resulting child would be considered the .

In some cases, girls or women were visited at night by a . After this visit, the woman announced to the public her new position of being possessed by a by placing a white-feathered arrow on the roof of her house.

==Contemporary ==
Contemporary are often seen at Shinto shrines, where they assist with shrine functions, perform ceremonial dances, offer fortune telling, sell souvenirs, and assist a in Shinto rites. Kuly describes the contemporary as: &quot;A far distant relative of her premodern shamanic sister, she is most probably a university student collecting a modest wage in this part-time position.&quot;

The ethnologist Kunio Yanagita (1875–1962), who first studied Japanese female shamans, differentiated them into who dance with bells and participate in rituals, who speak on behalf of the deceased, and who engage in cult worship and invocations (for instance, the Tenrikyo founder Nakayama Miki).

Researchers have further categorized contemporary in terms of their diverse traditions and practices. Such categorizations include blind (concentrated in north and east Japan), mostly-blind (north and east Japan), blind or (northeastern Japan), (north and east of Tokyo), (central Japan), blind (northwest Japan), who tap (&quot;bamboo grass&quot;) on their faces (northeast of Tokyo), plus family and village organizations. Others have divided miko or fujo by blindness between blind or who perform and spirit mediumship and sighted or who perform divination and invocations.

In the eclectic Shugendō religion, priests who practiced ecstasy often married . Many scholars identify shamanic characteristics in (&quot;New Religions&quot;) such as Sukyo Mahikari, Ōmoto, and Shinmeiaishinkai.

<text>The Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA, ) is a Government agency in Sweden operating under the Swedish Ministry of Education and Science. SNSA operates as a key component of the Swedish space programme, which is mostly carried out through international cooperation, and has included a sequence of satellite missions, both national ones and in cooperation with other nations. Furthermore, the agency distributes government grants to research and development, initiates research and development in space and remote sensing, and acts as the Swedish contact in international cooperative efforts.

By the 2010s, it had a yearly budget of approximately 900 Mkr (100 M€), about 70% of which being used to support various programmes performed by the European Space Agency (ESA) that had been deemed to be of importance to Sweden. As of 2018, SNSA comprised a total of 30 permanent employees, the majority operating from its office in the Solna Municipality of Stockholm, Sweden. Rymdstyrelsen changed its English name from the Swedish National Space Board to the Swedish National Space Agency in 2018.

== History ==
===Background===
The nation of Sweden&#x27;s space activities predate the establishment of SNSA by several decades; a key early milestone was the founding of the Kiruna Geophysical Observatory (KGO) during July 1957, which had been preceded by over a decade of appeals and negotiations by members of the Swedish scientific community. Even prior to the KGO&#x27;s establishment, it had been recognised that Sweden was geographically well-positioned for numerous space-related activities, including the observation of atmospheric phenomenon such at the aurora borealis, due to its relatively mild climate in relation to its proximity to the Arctic Circle. The KGO attracted numerous international scientists, and acted as a gateway to further collaborative efforts, including space-based activities.

In 1959, the Swedish Space Research Committee (SSRC) was founded to pursue three primary objectives: the development of a national space programme, to ensure Swedish engagement with international projects, and to handle a prospective launch site for sounding rockets. Almost immediately upon its creation, the committee begun negotiations to participate in the newly created European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), in line with its second objective. However, this ambition was somewhat complicated due to the committee&#x27;s lack of executive authority, and the Swedish government&#x27;s wider policy ambitions of stringent non-alignment, although the concept of some level of European cooperation was politically palatable. Accordingly, while Sweden did sign the ESRO Convention during June 1962, membership of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) was spurned; these decisions were as much motivated by political and industrial factors as they were by scientific ones.

During August 1961, the launching of sounding rockets commenced at the Vidsel Test Range. The endeavor has taken advantage of an offer from the United States to launch European research satellites at no cost, although the project did ultimately require financing by both the Swedish Space Research Committee and the Swedish National Defence Research Institute (FOA). Numerous such launches proceeded from Vidsel over the following years and decades. The ESRO also established Esrange as one of its scientific sites and launched its first rocket during November 1966; this move was met with expressions of concern by the Soviet Union of the location&#x27;s potential militarisation. This pressure contributed to Sweden&#x27;s push for complete transparency of its space-based operations.

===Formation===
By the mid-1960s, Sweden&#x27;s space activities were being conducted by a series of different institutions and entities, leading to increasing confusion and calls for its reorganisation. Such reorganisation did occur, but not with any urgency. During the early 1970s, Sweden restarted its national sounding-rocket programme, benefiting from a considerable drop in price over the previous decade and funding for the endeavour from the FOA. There was also considerations of Sweden&#x27;s potential take over of operations at Estrange from the ESRO, although sufficient funding for such ambitions was lacking.

The committee recognised that there was a clear need for a centralised agency for Sweden&#x27;s space activities, although there was some dispute as to its programme&#x27;s contents. While the pursuit of independence was viewed positively, there was also a great deal of support for the ELDO&#x27;s activities. As a consequence of the ESRO&#x27;s reorganisation into the European Space Agency (ESA), it was decided that a central Swedish authority, the Swedish National Space Board, would be created with full authority for the policy and planning of space-based activities, which were divided into two categories: space research and space applications. This was enacted, along with the takeover of the Estrange location, during July 1972.

While the Swedish National Space Board acted as the administrative authority, operations were conducted by the Swedish Space Corporation, a state-owned entity that was responsible at a system level and subcontracted out activities to industry. In its early years of operation, the efforts of the board were on three distinct areas: research, application, and remote sensing. In practice, the research and application focuses largely mirrored on another. After only a few years, the board&#x27;s activities were subsequently regrouped along national boundaries. It largely focused upon negotiating with international organisations, primarily the ESA, over prospective Swedish participation in various projects, and the application of funding to suitable endeavours.

===Activities===
A key milestone of Sweden&#x27;s space activities was its first satellite, named Viking. Work on Viking commenced in January 1978 and benefitted greatly from substantial increases to Sweden&#x27;s space budget during the early 1980s. While initially intended as a collaborative effort with the Soviet Union, plans to use a Soviet launcher was abandoned in favour of the ESA&#x27;s Ariane 1 in September 1979. The satellite platform, which was constructed by Boeing, was delivered to Saab during December 1982 for further manufacturing. On 22 February 1986, Viking was successfully launched from the ESA&#x27;s Guiana Space Centre, it spent numerous years exploring plasma processes in the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere and the ionosphere prior to being decommissioned.

Another particularly high-profile event was the launch of the first Swedish astronaut, Christer Fuglesang, into space during December 2006. This feat was accomplished through cooperation with multiple international entities, Fuglesang having been selected by the ESA in 1992 for a flight assignment and undergone training in Russia and the United States prior to his flight on the Space Shuttle. Fuglesang&#x27;s activities on the International Space Station was met with heavy coverage by Sweden&#x27;s media, and led to a spike in attention to other Swedish space activities.

In February 2013, a government audit was released by the Swedish National Audit Office; amongst its conclusions, it observed that &quot;Swedish space investment is distributed among multiple organizations that operate as stovepipes with no real communication between them and no common ambition.&quot; While approximately 1 billion Swedish krona (US$158 million) was being spent each year on Swedish space initiatives by this time, the audit report calls for additional oversight by the Swedish government of the European Space Agency (ESA), along with a review of the Swedish Space Corporation&#x27;s operations and purpose.

==== Entry-level servers ====
Entry-level servers used either the NetServer or ProLiant brands. The NetServer line of servers were discontinued following the merger with Compaq in 2002, with the ProLiant line of servers succeeding it afterwards. The ProLiant line of servers was then acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise in 2015 after HP split up into two separate companies.

Despite the ProLiant name being used on some of these entry-level servers listed below, they are based on HP&#x27;s former NetServer line of servers from 1993–2002 (more specifically the &quot;tc&quot; series) and as such do not come with Compaq&#x27;s SmartStart or Insight Management Agents. This is especially applicable to the later, post-merger ProLiant models made by HP, as earlier, pre-merger models made by Compaq under the ProLiant brand did come with the aforementioned management tools.

<text>Flutes made in China come in a variety of different types:

Transverse flutes:
*Dizi (and its varieties such as the qudi and bangdi; primary transverse flutes, usually made of bamboo and distinctively has a buzzing membrane)
*Koudi (a small center-blown mouth flute with open-ends)
*Tuliang (a large center-blown flute with open-ends)
*Chi (an ancient center-blown transverse flute with closed ends and front finger holes.)
*Hengxiao (dizi without membrane)
*Xindi (fully chromatic dizi without membrane)
*Jiajian Di (keyed dizi without membrane)

End-blown flute:
*Xiao (end-blown vertical bamboo flute)
*Gudi, an ancient vertical flute made from the bones of large birds
*Paixiao (pan pipes with distinctive notched or curved blowholes to allow for greater expression)
*Xun (clay globular flute)
(Uyghur and Mongolian minorities also play a version of the Turkish ney.)

Fipple flutes:
*Jiexiao &quot;Sister xiao&quot; (one of many forms of recorder-style flutes)
*Dongdi (special recorder-style flute with additional internal reed)
*Paidi (fipple pipes)
*Taodi and Wudu (Chinese ocarina.)

Free reed flutes:
*Bawu (transverse free-reed flute)
*Hulusi (vertical gourd free-reed flute normally with one or two drone pipes)

Chinese flutes are generally made from bamboo (see bamboo flute) and belong to the &quot;bamboo&quot; classification of Chinese music, although they can be (and have been) made of other materials such as jade.

<doc id="590308" wikidata="Q58962" url="?curid=590308" title="Eleanor F. Helin">
<text>Eleanor Francis &quot;Glo&quot; Helin (née Francis, 19 November 1932 – 25 January 2009) was an American astronomer. She was principal investigator of the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program of NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. (Some sources give her name as Eleanor Kay Helin.)

Helin was a prolific discoverer of minor planets &quot;(see list)&quot; and several comets, including periodic comets 111P/Helin–Roman–Crockett, 117P/Helin–Roman–Alu and 132P/Helin–Roman–Alu. She is credited as the discoverer of the object now known as both asteroid 4015 Wilson–Harrington and comet 107P/Wilson–Harrington. Although Wilson and Harrington preceded her by some decades, their observations did not establish an orbit for the object, while her rediscovery did. Helin discovered or co-discovered 903 asteroids and several comets.

== Biography ==
Helin was born an only child to Fred and Kay Francis. At the age of five, she became ill with polio, which caused her to be bed-ridden for several months.

Helin studied geology at Occidental College, leaving just shy of her graduation in 1954. She married Ron Helin and started working at California Institute of Technology, where she and Bruce C. Murray started the Lunar Research Lab to prepare for lunar landing missions.

Helin was active in planetary science and astronomy at the California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for over three decades. Her studies of lunar craters raised interest about near Earth Objects, and in the early 1970s, she initiated the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS) from Palomar Observatory. This program is responsible for the discovery of thousands of asteroids of all types including more than 200 in high inclination orbits, other asteroids in rare and unique types of orbits, 20 comets, and approximately 30 percent of the near-Earth asteroids discovered worldwide. Using the 18-inch Schmidt telescope, Helin discovered her first asteroid on July 3, 1973.

In 1980, Helin started working at JPL, where she organized and coordinated the International Near-Earth Asteroid Survey (INAS) during the 1980s, encouraging and stimulating worldwide interest in asteroids. In recognition of her accomplishments, she received NASA&#x27;s Exceptional Service Medal.

After conducting the PCAS photographic search program from Palomar for nearly 25 years, Helin concentrated on the new, upgraded Near Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) search program using electronic sensors on a large aperture telescope. She was the principal investigator for this program operating from JPL, for which she received the 1997 JPL Award for Excellence. She also received NASA&#x27;s Group Achievement Award for the NEAT Team.

In operation from 1995 to 2007, NEAT was the first autonomous observing program; no JPL personnel were on-site, only the JPL Sunspark computer which ran the observing system through the night and transmitted the data back to JPL each morning for team member review and confirmation. NEAT detected over 26,000 objects, including 31 near-Earth asteroids, two long period comets and the unique object, 1996 PW, the most eccentric asteroid known (e = 0.99012940), which moves in a long-period (4110.50 a), comet-like orbit (semi-major axis 256.601 AU).

Helin retired from NASA in 2002, and died in January 2009.

Caltech Optical Observatories hosted a Helin Commemorative Workshop on 28 September 2010 to honour the contributions of Eleanor and Ronald Helin. Palomar Observatory opened an exhibit dedicated to her and her work with the 18-inch Schmidt telescope in September 2013.

== Awards and honors ==
The Mars-crossing asteroid 3267 Glo, discovered by Edward Bowell in 1981, was named after her nickname. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 13 February 1987 ().

In 1991, the USS &quot;Helin&quot; debuted on the movie &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. The ship was named after her for &quot;having discovered an unprecedented number of asteroids and comets&quot;.

In 1992, Helin received an honorary doctorate from her alma mater, Occidental College.

Helin was awarded the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. In 1998 she was inducted to the Women in Technology Hall of Fame.

== Discoveries by Helin ==
Helin is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery or co-discovered of more than 900 numbered minor planets, including the first two Aten asteroids: 2062 Aten and 2100 Ra-Shalom, which gave rise to this new orbital group of near-Earth objects.

She also discovered:
* Apollo asteroids such as 2135 Aristaeus, 3360 Syrinx, 4034 Vishnu, 4197 Morpheus, 4660 Nereus, 4769 Castalia and 6489 Golevka, among others,
* Amor asteroids such as 3757 Anagolay, 3988 Huma, 4055 Magellan, 4957 Brucemurray, 5653 Camarillo, 7336 Saunders and 8013 Gordonmoore,
* three Jupiter trojans including 3240 Laocoon,
* Mars-crossers such as 9969 Braille,
* hundreds of main-belt asteroids such as 4897 Tomhamilton,

Comets discovered by Helin include:
* 111P/Helin–Roman–Crockett
* 117P/Helin–Roman–Alu
* 132P/Helin–Roman–Alu
* 151P/Helin
* 152P/Helin–Lawrence
* The asteroid / Periodic comet 4015 Wilson–Harrington

<text>Sakıp Sabancı (7 April 1933 – 10 April 2004) was a Turkish business tycoon and philanthropist.

==Biography==
He was the second son of a cotton trader and worked in his father&#x27;s business without completing high school. He was the head of Turkey&#x27;s largest business conglomerate and 147th richest man on the Forbes list of billionaires in 2004.

In the 1980s, he took over the family business with assistance from his brothers.

The Sabancı Group of Companies operates in eighteen countries and markets its products internationally. Currently, Sabancı Holding controls more than 60 companies, in textiles, tourism, automotives, chemicals, tobacco, cement, insurance and banking. The group also has partnerships with the Hilton Group, Bridgestone, Du Pont, Philip Morris, Bekaert, Heidelberg Cement, IBM, BNP Paribas, Dresdner Bank, Carrefour and International Paper. Sabancı Holding and ten other companies within the group are listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. In 2011, the consolidated revenue of the company was $13.4 billion. The Sabancı family holds a 60.6% share of the firm.

Sakip Sabanci founded the Sabancı University in 1999. His collections of more than 320 Ottoman and Turkish paintings, statues and more than 400 examples of Ottoman calligraphy are exhibited at &quot;Atlı Köşk&quot; (English: The Equestrian Villa) at Bosporus in Emirgan, Istanbul, where he and his family lived for years, and which was converted into the Sakıp Sabancı Museum in 2002.

He died of kidney cancer at the age of 71 and received a state funeral.

In 2016, Columbia University established the Sakıp Sabancı Chair and Center for Turkish Studies, the first initiative of its kind in the United States. This initiative, supported by a $10 million donation, aims to enhance knowledge and awareness of Turkey through research, teaching, and intellectual exchange. The establishment of the professorship and the center is part of a broader effort to foster academic collaboration and promote Turkish studies globally. Additionally, the gift will contribute to research and academic partnerships at Sabancı University in Istanbul.

<doc id="590320" wikidata="Q21791" url="?curid=590320" title="Nadine Strossen">
<text>Nadine Strossen (born August 18, 1950) is an American legal scholar and civil liberties activist who served as the president of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) from 1991 to 2008. A liberal feminist, she was the first woman to lead the ACLU. A professor at New York Law School, Strossen is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and other professional organizations.

== Early life and education ==
Strossen was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, on August 18, 1950. Her maternal grandfather was an immigrant to the United States from Yugoslavia and was a conscientious objector during World War I, causing him to be publicly humiliated at the courthouse in Hudson County. Strossen&#x27;s father, Woodrow J. Strossen, was born in Germany, where he was labeled as a half-Jew and spoke against Nazism. He was removed from school and placed in the Buchenwald concentration camp until being liberated by American troops. Strossen&#x27;s mother, a member of the National Organization for Women and supporter of Planned Parenthood, was an advocate for women&#x27;s rights.

When she was eight years old, Strossen&#x27;s family moved to Hopkins, Minnesota. As a child, she frequented the local public library. She initially considered pursuing a career as a teacher; while attending high school in Hopkins, Strossen distinguished herself as a member of the school&#x27;s debate team, of which she was the only girl. In 1968, Strossen enrolled at Radcliffe College, where she was a resident of Holmes Hall (now a part of Pforzheimer House) before moving to Winthrop House in 1970. She met her husband, Eli Noam, while they were both at Harvard when he was a tutor in Adams House.

In addition to her involvement in debate, Strossen became interested in feminism as an undergraduate student. She subscribed to a political philosophy of civil libertarianism, later recalling that &quot;the rallying cries were reproductive freedom and the anti-war movement&quot;. She graduated in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in history and literature as a National Merit Scholar along with membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Strossen then attended Harvard Law School, becoming an editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;, and obtaining her Juris Doctor (J.D.), &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, in 1975. After graduating, she was a law clerk for a year at the Minnesota Supreme Court.

== Career ==
Strossen was an attorney in private practice, first in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from 1976 to 1978, then in New York City at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell from 1978 to 1984. She left practicing to begin teaching as an associate professor of clinical law at the New York Law School from 1984 until 1988. Strossen specialized in constitutional law, federal courts, and human rights.

In 1983, Strossen joined the national board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), then its national executive committee in 1985. From 1986 to 1991, she served as the organization&#x27;s general counsel. In the spring of 1990, ACLU president Norman Dorsen announced that he would be stepping down, and Strossen emerged as one of four candidates to assume the position, winning on the second ballot.

=== President of the ACLU ===
In 1991, Strossen became the first female president of the American Civil Liberties Union. She was the sixth person to have served in the position. As president, Strossen made over 200 public presentations. In May 2008, she announced her resignation. On October 18, 2008, the ACLU selected Susan Herman, a constitutional law professor at Brooklyn Law School in New York, to replace her.

== Other activities ==
She appeared in the 2000 docudrama &quot;Dirty Pictures&quot;. In October 2001, Strossen made her theater debut as the guest star in Eve Ensler&#x27;s play, &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C.

Having been appointed as the chaired John Marshall Harlan II Professor of Law in 2015, she teaches constitutional law and human rights.

In 2019, her book &quot;Hate: Why We Should Resist It with Free Speech, Not Censorship&quot; was chosen as the Washington University in St. Louis Common Reading book. On August 26, Strossen delivered a keynote address at the university. On April 12, 2021, in &quot;shaping Opinion&quot;, Strossen and host Tim O&#x27;Brien discussed her opinions and possible solutions on countering harmful or &quot;hate speech&quot; other than censoring it, as she sets out in her book.

Strossen spoke at the inaugural gala for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression in New York City in April 2023.

* University of Austin (UATX), founding member

== Personal life ==
Strossen is married to Eli Noam, a professor at Columbia Business School. They married in 1980. When she grew up, Strossen&#x27;s mother prevented her from playing with dolls, an experience which she later suggested to have contributed in her choice not to have children.
