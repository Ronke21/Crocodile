<text>Saddleworth is a civil parish of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham in Greater Manchester, England. It comprises several villages and hamlets as well as suburbs of Oldham on the west side of the Pennine hills.

Areas include Austerlands, Delph, Denshaw, Diggle, Dobcross, Friezland, Grasscroft, Greenfield, Grotton, Lydgate, Scouthead, Springhead and Uppermill.

Saddleworth lies east of Oldham and northeast of Manchester. It is broadly rural and had a population of 25,460 at the 2011 Census, making it one of the larger civil parishes in the United Kingdom.

Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire and following the Industrial Revolution, in the 18th and 19th centuries, Saddleworth became a centre for cotton spinning and weaving. By the end of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, mechanised textile production had become a vital part of the local economy. The Royal George Mill, owned by the Whitehead family, manufactured felt used for pianofortes, billiard tables and flags.

Following the Great Depression Saddleworth&#x27;s textile sector declined. Much of Saddleworth&#x27;s architecture and infrastructure dates from its textile processing days however, notably the Saddleworth Viaduct and several cottages and terraces, many built by the local mill owners.

For centuries Saddleworth was linked, ecclesiastically, with the parish of Rochdale and was long talked of as the part of Yorkshire where Lancastrians lived. The former Saddleworth Urban District was the only part of the West Riding to have been amalgamated into Greater Manchester in 1974. However, strong cultural links with Yorkshire remain amongst its communities. There are several brass bands in the parish.

==History==

===Early history===
The first documentary evidence of Saddleworth appears in the Domesday Book of 1086, in which it is referred to as &quot;Quick&quot;, spelt &quot;Thoac&quot;; where it is described as &quot;Land of the King in Eurvicsire (Yorkshire), Agbrigg Wapentake.&quot;

The history of the region clearly dates further back than the Domesday Book however. Place names derived from Celtic and Anglian dialects, along with the discovery of flint arrowheads and gold Viking rings all point to a much earlier Saddleworth, possibly as old as the Stone Age. A Roman road from Chester to York passed through the area. Castleshaw Roman fort was built to defend and patrol the local section of the road. The first fort on the site was an Agricolan-period fort, built in turf and timber . This was refurbished soon after construction and then abandoned . Within the south eastern half of the fort, a fortlet was constructed, also in turf and timber, . This was redeveloped during its brief occupation and then abandoned again . In the Saddleworth area is a bowl barrow, which may be Bronze Age, located at . Despite excavations, no grave goods or human remains have been found in the barrow.

===Industrial history===

The steep slopes of the Saddleworth area and the acidic soils of the region have never been particularly conducive to intensive farming; meaning that long before the Victorian era, Saddleworth already had a long established, albeit domestic, textile tradition. Small, basic mills had been existent in Saddleworth before the industrial revolution, but these were increasingly replaced by larger more intensive establishments. By the end of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, mechanised textile production had become a vital part of the local economy.

The boom in industry that had occurred in Saddleworth during the Industrial Revolution called for greater transport links. Construction of the Huddersfield Narrow Canal was begun in 1794, at the height of Canal Mania, connecting Huddersfield to Stalybridge via Saddleworth and completed seventeen years later in 1811; when the Standedge Canal Tunnel at Diggle was finally opened. The decline of canals and the rise of steam powered locomotives left the canal falling behind the competition, and so it was decided that a railway tunnel would be built parallel to the canal, which was completed in 1848. The rise in traffic demanded a second tunnel be built, completed in 1871. Both of these were single line tunnels and eventually superseded by the 1894 tunnel, a double line tunnel, which is the only one of the three still regularly carrying passengers.

The three brothers, Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead, James Heywood Whitehead and Francis Frederick Whitehead, were extremely philanthropic and amongst other bequests in the 1850s built Christ Church in Friezland along with the Parsonage, School and Headmaster&#x27;s house. The land on which these were built was purchased in 1849 from L. &amp; N.W. Railway Company. The Church School has been rebuilt and the Parsonage and grounds, built in the Gothic Revival style and referred to in Pevsner&#x27;s Guide, has become a Grade II listed building, now in private hands. The boom in industry called for greater transport links, including the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and several railways.

Unlike the majority of the Oldham Metropolitan Borough, where the industrial architecture was generally constructed from Accrington redbrick, Saddleworth&#x27;s textiles mills and supporting infrastructure was made from the local millstone grit. This is in keeping with other settlements amongst the southwest Pennines, such as Milnrow near Rochdale.

==Governance==
Although on the western side of the Pennine watershed, Saddleworth, or &#x27;Quick&#x27; as it was once known, has lain within the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire since the Middle Ages. From a very ancient time, the area formed part of the Agbrigg Wapentake, in the &quot;Land of the King in Eurvicsire&quot; (Yorkshire).

For a time, during the 17th century, Saddleworth constituted a chapelry within the ancient parish of Rochdale in Salfordshire, the other parts of which were entirely in the ancient county of Lancashire.

In 1866 it became a civil parish in its own right and in 1889 became part of the administrative county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. In 1894 the parish&#x27;s boundaries were altered with the parts in Quickmere Middle Division (Springhead), Mossley and Uppermill becoming Urban Districts. The residue became a single-parish rural district.

In 1872, Saddleworth was recorded to be &quot;a hamlet, a chapelry, a township, and a district, in Rochdale parish and West Riding of Yorkshire&quot;. At this time, a post office for the area was found under the name of Uppermill which was under Manchester.

In 1900 the boundaries were changed again with the inclusion of Uppermill, and the single-parish rural district being instead replaced by the &quot;Saddleworth Urban District&quot;. In 1937 it incorporated Springhead Urban District.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, the West Riding County Council was abolished and Saddleworth was incorporated, for administrative purposes, into the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

Unlike neighbouring Shaw and Crompton, Saddleworth is a successor parish, and thus was automatically granted civil parish status in 1974, when its urban district status was abolished. Up until 1996, Saddleworth&#x27;s official postal county was Lancashire, due to it forming part of the Oldham post town. Postal counties were abolished in 1996.

===Parliamentary representation===
Saddleworth forms part of the Oldham East and Saddleworth parliamentary constituency, of which the Member of Parliament is Debbie Abrahams. It is split into three electoral wards; &quot;Saddleworth North&quot;, &quot;Saddleworth South&quot; and &quot;Saddleworth West and Lees&quot;

==Geography==
Saddleworth makes up around 52% of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham in terms of area, and remains largely rural. Saddleworth Moor in the Dark Peak area of the Peak District National Park is a moorland plateau that straddles the boundary with West Yorkshire.

Bounded directly to the west by Oldham and the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale in the north, Tameside in the south and Kirklees in the east. Saddleworth is southwest of Huddersfield.

===Settlements===

Saddleworth contains a collection of villages and hamlets, including:

==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, Saddleworth had a total population of 24,351. For every 100 females, there were 94.7 males. The average household size was 2.39. Of those aged 16–74 in Saddleworth, 45.3% had no academic qualifications or one GCSE, lower than the figures for all of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham (55.2%) and about the same for England (45.5%). According to the census, 1.9% were unemployed and 28.2% were economically inactive. 18.5% of the population were under the age of 16 and 7.3% were aged 75 and over; the mean age of the people of Saddleworth was 40.92. 71.5% of residents described their health as &#x27;good&#x27;.

===Population change===

==Culture==

===Identity===
Since the local government reforms of 1974, some of the people of Saddleworth have been uneasy about their primary geographic reference frame, with parts of the local community feeling aggrieved at Saddleworth forming part of Greater Manchester. Saddleworth, where the local architecture of stone cottages is of the Yorkshire type, is the only part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham to come from the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire, the rest being from Lancashire. It is also the only part of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester which lay within those borders.

The Saddleworth White Rose Society organises events every Yorkshire Day (1 August) to promote its contention that Saddleworth remains part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The Prince of Wales referred to Saddleworth&#x27;s continuing Yorkshire status when he visited the area in 2001 saying &quot;The fact that Saddleworth is still part of the historic West Riding is extremely important&quot;.

In 2004, public meetings were held to discuss the feasibility of splitting Saddleworth from the Borough of Oldham. Some residents at the time said they would prefer to become part of the metropolitan county of West Yorkshire or a new South Pennine authority, connecting rural towns and villages on both sides of the border. Even though such a move could involve merging with the neighbouring Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, Oldham councillors maintained the split was not feasible as Saddleworth does not have sufficient hospital provision, civic buildings, transport, schooling nor other infrastructure in its own right. Councillor Ken Hulme arranged a meeting for the matter to be discussed. One councillor remarked &quot;They [Saddleworth] want a bigger slice of the pie than the rest of the borough. The people of the rest of Oldham are not going to subsidise Saddleworth, and Saddleworth can&#x27;t go it alone. It couldn&#x27;t afford to provide the services it needs.&quot;

In 2010, Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council erected new signs along its boundaries. Those marking the boundary of Saddleworth say &#x27;in the historic County of York&#x27; at the top, alongside a white rose. Later in the year, signs were unveiled by local dignitaries at Grains Bar marking the historic border between Lancashire and Yorkshire.

===Whit Friday===
Saddleworth has a large number of annual customs and traditions, many of which are held during Whitsuntide. On Whit Friday morning, congregations from the churches of all of the Saddleworth villages hold their Walk of Witness and congregate in Uppermill to take part in a religious service. Later in the evening, the Whit Friday brass band contests take place. The band contests originated in Saddleworth and the nearby towns of Mossley and Stalybridge in 1884 and are still centred on the local area. The first band to win in Uppermill was the Wyke Temperance Band. Bands from around the country, and indeed the world, travel to the area annually to compete. Due to the huge popularity of the event, Whit Friday band contests are now held in others of Saddleworth&#x27;s surrounding villages. In the village of Dobcross a Henry Livings memorial prize is open to bands who play on any of the morning&#x27;s walks on Whit Friday.

===Sadd Fest===
The Festival spotlights musical talent from local bands and artists to raise money for charity.
This event was started in 2013 by the Saddleworth branch of the Round Table as an alternative to the prior &#x27;Beer Walk&#x27; event which was cancelled in 2011. The beer walk started in 1973. Participants walked around Saddleworth in fancy dress, stopping at pubs. Spectators were encouraged to donate money for charity. It was organised for 39 years, however due to 4,000 (approx) unofficial walkers taking part in the event, in addition to the 2,500 official walkers, the police estimated it would cost £58,000 to stage the walk in 2012. However, some people continue to do the walk unofficially.

===Rushcart===

The origin of the event is unclear, however it is unlikely to be before 1800. By the early 20th century the tradition had died out due to the railways, as the local population travelled further for their annual break during the Saddleworth Wakes week. However The Rushcart was revived in 1975 by the newly formed Saddleworth Morris Men following research by Fred Broadbent and Peter Ashworth, who were able to still hear the stories of the Rushcart from the older members of the community. The audience at the time was small, which is in stark contrast to the numbers that gather now.

===Yanks Weekend===
The event started in 2001 to celebrate the local filming of the Hollywood film &quot;Yanks&quot; in 1979 starring Richard Gere. Many locations in Uppermill and neighbouring Dobcross were used in the film.

===Sport===
*Saddleworth Cricket Club play home matches at their Well-i-Hole ground in Friezland. They are members of the Greater Manchester Cricket League.
*Saddleworth Rangers are an amateur rugby league club who play home matches at Greenfield.
*Saddleworth Clarion is the area&#x27;s cycling club, catering for on and off-road club cycling

<text>Jean-Nicolas Stofflet (; 3 February 1753 – 25 February 1796) was a French leader of the Revolt in the Vendée against the First French Republic.

Born in Bathelémont-lès-Bauzemont (Meurthe-et-Moselle), the son of a miller, he was for long a private in the Swiss Guard, and afterwards gamekeeper to the comte de Colbert-Maulévrier, he joined the Vendéans when they rose against the Revolution to defend Roman Catholicism and Royalist principles. During the war in Vendée, he served first under Maurice d&#x27;Elbée, and fought at Fontenay-le-Comte, Cholet and Saumur, and distinguished himself at the battles of Beaupréau, Laval and Antrain.

He was appointed major-general of the Royalist army, and in 1794 succeeded Henri de la Rochejaquelein as commander-in-chief of the Catholic and Royal Army. Stofflet established his headquarters in the Forest of Vezins. But his quarrels with another Vendéan leader, François de Charette, and the defeats sustained by the Vendéan troops, led him to give in his submission and to accept the terms of the Treaty of La Jaunaye with the National Convention (2 May 1795).

He, however, soon violated this treaty, and at the instigation of Royalist agents took arms in December of the same year or behalf of the Count of Provence, from whom he had received the rank of &quot;maréchal-de-camp&quot;. This last action of Stofflet&#x27;s failed completely. He was taken prisoner by the Republic, sentenced to death by a military commission, and shot at Angers.

<text>John Goodricke FRS (17 September 1764 – 20 April 1786) was an English amateur astronomer. He is best known for his observations of the variable star Algol (Beta Persei) in 1782.

== Life and work ==
John Goodricke, named after his great-grandfather Sir John Goodricke 1617–1670 (see Goodricke baronets of Ribston Hall), was born in Groningen in the Netherlands, but lived most of his life in England. He became deaf in early childhood due to a severe illness. His parents sent him to Thomas Braidwood&#x27;s Academy, a school for deaf pupils in Edinburgh, and in 1778 to the Warrington Academy.

After leaving Warrington, Goodricke returned to live with his parents in York. There, he became friends with his neighbour Edward Pigott, whose father Nathaniel Pigott had built a sophisticated private observatory. Edward was already interested in variable stars, and he gave Goodricke a list of those that he thought were worthy of observation.

Goodricke is credited with discovering the periodic variation of β Lyrae and δ Cephei, the prototypical example of the Cepheid variable stars.

Although several stars were already known to vary in apparent magnitude, Goodricke was the first to propose a mechanism to account for this. He suggested that Algol is what is now known as an eclipsing binary. He presented his findings to the Royal Society in May 1783, and for this work, the Society awarded him the Copley Medal for that year. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 16 April 1786. He never learned of this honour however, as he died four days later from pneumonia. He never married.

== Goodricke in Yorkshire ==
Goodricke was buried at Hunsingore Church, then in West Yorkshire, along with many of his relatives.

Today there is a marker in York near the site of John Goodricke&#x27;s observatory.

In 1949, Sidney Melmore showed that Goodricke worked from the Treasurer&#x27;s House (now owned by the National Trust) very near York Minster, and concluded that he had observed from the north window of the top floor of the south-east wing, looking south towards the Minster. However, records indicate that the Goodricke family had rented rooms from Edward Topham, the then owner of the northwest wing of the house.

Goodricke College at the University of York is named after Goodricke. There is also a modern sculpture named &quot;Algol&quot; in the grounds.

==Honours==
Asteroid 3116 Goodricke is named for John Goodricke.

The University of York has a Goodricke College named after John Goodricke.

The Goodricke-Pigott Observatory is a private astronomical observatory in Tucson, Arizona, named after both Goodricke and Pigott. It was formally dedicated on 26 October 1996.

<text>In computing, a Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not – in other words, a query returns either &quot;possibly in set&quot; or &quot;definitely not in set&quot;. Elements can be added to the set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with the counting Bloom filter variant); the more items added, the larger the probability of false positives.

Bloom proposed the technique for applications where the amount of source data would require an impractically large amount of memory if &quot;conventional&quot; error-free hashing techniques were applied. He gave the example of a hyphenation algorithm for a dictionary of 500,000 words, out of which 90% follow simple hyphenation rules, but the remaining 10% require expensive disk accesses to retrieve specific hyphenation patterns. With sufficient core memory, an error-free hash could be used to eliminate all unnecessary disk accesses; on the other hand, with limited core memory, Bloom&#x27;s technique uses a smaller hash area but still eliminates most unnecessary accesses. For example, a hash area only 18% of the size needed by an ideal error-free hash still eliminates 87% of the disk accesses.

More generally, fewer than 10 bits per element are required for a 1% false positive probability, independent of the size or number of elements in the set.

== Algorithm description ==
An &quot;empty Bloom filter&quot; is a bit array of bits, all set to 0. It is equipped with different hash functions, which map set elements to one of the possible array positions. To be optimal, the hash functions should be uniformly distributed and independent. Typically, is a small constant which depends on the desired false error rate , while is proportional to and the number of elements to be added.

To &quot;add&quot; an element, feed it to each of the hash functions to get array positions. Set the bits at all these positions to 1.

To &quot;test&quot; whether an element is in the set, feed it to each of the hash functions to get array positions. If &quot;any&quot; of the bits at these positions is 0, the element is definitely not in the set; if it were, then all the bits would have been set to 1 when it was inserted. If all are 1, then either the element is in the set, &quot;or&quot; the bits have by chance been set to 1 during the insertion of other elements, resulting in a false positive. In a simple Bloom filter, there is no way to distinguish between the two cases, but more advanced techniques can address this problem.

The requirement of designing different independent hash functions can be prohibitive for large . For a good hash function with a wide output, there should be little if any correlation between different bit-fields of such a hash, so this type of hash can be used to generate multiple &quot;different&quot; hash functions by slicing its output into multiple bit fields. Alternatively, one can pass different initial values (such as 0, 1, ...,  − 1) to a hash function that takes an initial value; or add (or append) these values to the key. For larger and/or , independence among the hash functions can be relaxed with negligible increase in false positive rate. (Specifically, show the effectiveness of deriving the indices using enhanced double hashing
and triple hashing, variants of double hashing that are effectively simple random number generators seeded with the two or three hash values.)

Removing an element from this simple Bloom filter is impossible because there is no way to tell which of the bits it maps to should be cleared. Although setting any one of those bits to zero suffices to remove the element, it would also remove any other elements that happen to map onto that bit. Since the simple algorithm provides no way to determine whether any other elements have been added that affect the bits for the element to be removed, clearing any of the bits would introduce the possibility of false negatives.

One-time removal of an element from a Bloom filter can be simulated by having a second Bloom filter that contains items that have been removed. However, false positives in the second filter become false negatives in the composite filter, which may be undesirable. In this approach re-adding a previously removed item is not possible, as one would have to remove it from the &quot;removed&quot; filter.

It is often the case that all the keys are available but are expensive to enumerate (for example, requiring many disk reads). When the false positive rate gets too high, the filter can be regenerated; this should be a relatively rare event.

==Space and time advantages==
While risking false positives, Bloom filters have a substantial space advantage over other data structures for representing sets, such as self-balancing binary search trees, tries, hash tables, or simple arrays or linked lists of the entries. Most of these require storing at least the data items themselves, which can require anywhere from a small number of bits, for small integers, to an arbitrary number of bits, such as for strings ( are an exception since they can share storage between elements with equal prefixes). However, Bloom filters do not store the data items at all, and a separate solution must be provided for the actual storage. Linked structures incur an additional linear space overhead for pointers. A Bloom filter with a 1% error and an optimal value of , in contrast, requires only about 9.6 bits per element, regardless of the size of the elements. This advantage comes partly from its compactness, inherited from arrays, and partly from its probabilistic nature. The 1% false-positive rate can be reduced by a factor of ten by adding only about 4.8 bits per element.

However, if the number of potential values is small and many of them can be in the set, the Bloom filter is easily surpassed by the deterministic bit array, which requires only one bit for each potential element. Hash tables gain a space and time advantage if they begin ignoring collisions and store only whether each bucket contains an entry; in this case, they have effectively become Bloom filters with .

Bloom filters also have the unusual property that the time needed either to add items or to check whether an item is in the set is a fixed constant, , completely independent of the number of items already in the set. No other constant-space set data structure has this property, but the average access time of sparse hash tables can make them faster in practice than some Bloom filters. In a hardware implementation, however, the Bloom filter shines because its lookups are independent and can be parallelized.

To understand its space efficiency, it is instructive to compare the general Bloom filter with its special case when . If , then in order to keep the false positive rate sufficiently low, a small fraction of bits should be set, which means the array must be very large and contain long runs of zeros. The information content of the array relative to its size is low. The generalized Bloom filter ( greater than 1) allows many more bits to be set while still maintaining a low false positive rate; if the parameters ( and ) are chosen well, about half of the bits will be set, and these will be apparently random, minimizing redundancy and maximizing information content.

==Probability of false positives==
Assume that a hash function selects each array position with equal probability. If &quot;m&quot; is the number of bits in the array, the probability that a certain bit is not set to 1 by a certain hash function during the insertion of an element is
:formula_1

If &quot;k&quot; is the number of hash functions and each has no significant correlation between each other, then the probability that the bit is not set to 1 by any of the hash functions is
:formula_2

We can use the well-known identity for &quot;e&quot;−1
:formula_3
to conclude that, for large &quot;m&quot;,
:formula_4

If we have inserted &quot;n&quot; elements, the probability that a certain bit is still 0 is

:formula_5

the probability that it is 1 is therefore

:formula_6

Now test membership of an element that is not in the set. Each of the &quot;k&quot; array positions computed by the hash functions is 1 with a probability as above. The probability of all of them being 1, which would cause the algorithm to erroneously claim that the element is in the set, is often given as

:formula_7

This is not strictly correct as it assumes independence for the probabilities of each bit being set. However, assuming it is a close approximation we have that the probability of false positives decreases as &quot;m&quot; (the number of bits in the array) increases, and increases as &quot;n&quot; (the number of inserted elements) increases.

The true probability of a false positive, without assuming independence, is

: formula_8

where the {braces} denote Stirling numbers of the second kind.

An alternative analysis arriving at the same approximation without the assumption of independence is given by Mitzenmacher and Upfal. After all &quot;n&quot; items have been added to the Bloom filter, let &quot;q&quot; be the fraction of the &quot;m&quot; bits that are set to 0. (That is, the number of bits still set to 0 is &quot;qm&quot;.) Then, when testing membership of an element not in the set, for the array position given by any of the &quot;k&quot; hash functions, the probability that the bit is found set to 1 is formula_9. So the probability that all &quot;k&quot; hash functions find their bit set to 1 is formula_10. Further, the expected value of &quot;q&quot; is the probability that a given array position is left untouched by each of the &quot;k&quot; hash functions for each of the &quot;n&quot; items, which is (as above)
: formula_11.
It is possible to prove, without the independence assumption, that &quot;q&quot; is very strongly concentrated around its expected value. In particular, from the Azuma–Hoeffding inequality, they prove that
: formula_12
Because of this, we can say that the exact probability of false positives is
: formula_13
as before.

===Optimal number of hash functions===
The number of hash functions, &quot;k&quot;, must be a positive integer. Putting this constraint aside, for a given &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, the value of &quot;k&quot; that minimizes the false positive probability is

:formula_14

The required number of bits, &quot;m&quot;, given &quot;n&quot; (the number of inserted elements) and a desired false positive probability &quot;ε&quot; (and assuming the optimal value of &quot;k&quot; is used) can be computed by substituting the optimal value of &quot;k&quot; in the probability expression above:
:formula_15
which can be simplified to:
:formula_16
This results in:
:formula_17
So the optimal number of bits per element is
:formula_18
with the corresponding number of hash functions &quot;k&quot; (ignoring integrality):
:formula_19

This means that for a given false positive probability &quot;ε&quot;, the length of a Bloom filter &quot;m&quot; is proportionate to the number of elements being filtered &quot;n&quot; and the required number of hash functions only depends on the target false positive probability &quot;ε&quot;.

The formula formula_20 is approximate for three reasons. First, and of least concern, it approximates
formula_21 as formula_22, which is a good asymptotic approximation (i.e., which holds as &quot;m&quot; →∞). Second, of more concern, it assumes that during the membership test the event that one tested bit is set to 1 is independent of the event that any other tested bit is set to 1. Third, of most concern, it assumes that formula_23 is fortuitously integral.

Goel and Gupta, however, give a rigorous upper bound that makes no approximations and requires no assumptions. They show that the false positive probability for a finite Bloom filter with &quot;m&quot; bits (formula_24), &quot;n&quot; elements, and &quot;k&quot; hash functions is at most

:formula_25

This bound can be interpreted as saying that the approximate formula formula_26 can be applied at a penalty of at most half an extra element and at most one fewer bit.

==Approximating the number of items in a Bloom filter==

The number of items in a Bloom filter can be approximated with the following formula,

:formula_27

where formula_28 is an estimate of the number of items in the filter, m is the length (size) of the filter, k is the number of hash functions, and X is the number of bits set to one.

===The union and intersection of sets===

Bloom filters are a way of compactly representing a set of items. It is common to try to compute the size of the intersection or union between two sets. Bloom filters can be used to approximate the size of the intersection and union of two sets. For two Bloom filters of length , their counts, respectively can be estimated as

:formula_29

and

:formula_30

The size of their union can be estimated as

:formula_31

where formula_32 is the number of bits set to one in either of the two Bloom filters. Finally, the intersection can be estimated as

:formula_33

using the three formulas together.

==Properties==

* Unlike a standard hash table using open addressing for collision resolution, a Bloom filter of a fixed size can represent a set with an arbitrarily large number of elements; adding an element never fails due to the data structure &quot;filling up&quot;. However, the false positive rate increases steadily as elements are added until all bits in the filter are set to 1, at which point &quot;all&quot; queries yield a positive result. With open addressing hashing, false positives are never produced, but performance steadily deteriorates until it approaches linear search.
* Union and intersection of Bloom filters with the same size and set of hash functions can be implemented with bitwise OR and AND operations, respectively. The union operation on Bloom filters is lossless in the sense that the resulting Bloom filter is the same as the Bloom filter created from scratch using the union of the two sets. The intersect operation satisfies a weaker property: the false positive probability in the resulting Bloom filter is at most the false-positive probability in one of the constituent Bloom filters, but may be larger than the false positive probability in the Bloom filter created from scratch using the intersection of the two sets.
* Some kinds of superimposed code can be seen as a Bloom filter implemented with physical edge-notched cards. An example is Zatocoding, invented by Calvin Mooers in 1947, in which the set of categories associated with a piece of information is represented by notches on a card, with a random pattern of four notches for each category.

==Examples==
*Fruit flies use a modified version of Bloom filters to detect novelty of odors, with additional features including similarity of novel odor to that of previously experienced examples, and time elapsed since previous experience of the same odor.
*The servers of Akamai Technologies, a content delivery provider, use Bloom filters to prevent &quot;one-hit-wonders&quot; from being stored in its disk caches. One-hit-wonders are web objects requested by users just once, something that Akamai found applied to nearly three-quarters of their caching infrastructure. Using a Bloom filter to detect the second request for a web object and caching that object only on its second request prevents one-hit wonders from entering the disk cache, significantly reducing disk workload and increasing disk cache hit rates.
* Google Bigtable, Apache HBase, Apache Cassandra, ScyllaDB and PostgreSQL use Bloom filters to reduce the disk lookups for non-existent rows or columns. Avoiding costly disk lookups considerably increases the performance of a database query operation.
* The Google Chrome web browser previously used a Bloom filter to identify malicious URLs. Any URL was first checked against a local Bloom filter, and only if the Bloom filter returned a positive result was a full check of the URL performed (and the user warned, if that too returned a positive result).
* Microsoft Bing (search engine) uses multi-level hierarchical Bloom filters for its search index, BitFunnel. Bloom filters provided lower cost than the previous Bing index, which was based on inverted files.
* The Squid Web Proxy Cache uses Bloom filters for cache digests.
* Bitcoin used Bloom filters to speed up wallet synchronization until privacy vulnerabilities with the implementation of Bloom filters were discovered.
* The Venti archival storage system uses Bloom filters to detect previously stored data.
* The SPIN model checker uses Bloom filters to track the reachable state space for large verification problems.
* The Cascading analytics framework uses Bloom filters to speed up asymmetric joins, where one of the joined data sets is significantly larger than the other (often called Bloom join in the database literature).
* The Exim mail transfer agent (MTA) uses Bloom filters in its rate-limit feature.
* Medium uses Bloom filters to avoid recommending articles a user has previously read.
* Ethereum uses Bloom filters for quickly finding logs on the Ethereum blockchain.
* Grafana Tempo uses Bloom filters to improve query performance by storing bloom filters for each backend block. These are accessed on each query to determine the blocks containing data that meets the supplied search criteria

==Alternatives==

Classic Bloom filters use formula_34 bits of space per inserted key, where formula_35 is the false positive rate of the Bloom filter. However, the space that is strictly necessary for any data structure playing the same role as a Bloom filter is only formula_36 per key. Hence Bloom filters use 44% more space than an equivalent optimal data structure.

Pagh et al. provide a data structure that uses formula_37 bits while supporting constant amortized expected-time operations. Their data structure is primarily theoretical, but it is closely related to the widely-used quotient filter, which can be parameterized to useformula_38 bits of space, for an arbitrary parameter formula_39, while supporting formula_40-time operations. Advantages of the quotient filter, when compared to the Bloom filter, include its locality of reference and the ability to support deletions.

Another alternative to classic Bloom filter is the cuckoo filter, based on space-efficient variants of cuckoo hashing. In this case, a hash table is constructed, holding neither keys nor values, but short fingerprints (small hashes) of the keys. If looking up the key finds a matching fingerprint, then key is probably in the set. Cuckoo filters support deletions and have better locality of reference than Bloom filters. Additionally, in some parameter regimes, cuckoo filters can be parameterized to offer nearly optimal space guarantees.

Many alternatives to Bloom filters, including quotient filters and cuckoo filters, are based on the idea of hashing keys to random formula_41-bit fingerprints, and then storing those fingerprints in a compact hash table. This technique, which was first introduced by Carter et al. in 1978, relies on the fact that compact hash tables can be implemented to use roughly formula_42 bits less space than their non-compact counterparts. Using succinct hash tables, the space usage can be reduced to as little as formula_43 bits while supporting constant-time operations in a wide variety of parameter regimes.

 have studied some variants of Bloom filters that are either faster or use less space than classic Bloom filters. The basic idea of the fast variant is to locate the k hash values associated with each key into one or two blocks having the same size as processor&#x27;s memory cache blocks (usually 64 bytes). This will presumably improve performance by reducing the number of potential memory cache misses. The proposed variants have however the drawback of using about 32% more space than classic Bloom filters.

The space efficient variant relies on using a single hash function that generates for each key a value in the range formula_44 where formula_35 is the requested false positive rate. The sequence of values is then sorted and compressed using Golomb coding (or some other compression technique) to occupy a space close to formula_46 bits. To query the Bloom filter for a given key, it will suffice to check if its corresponding value is stored in the Bloom filter. Decompressing the whole Bloom filter for each query would make this variant totally unusable. To overcome this problem the sequence of values is divided into small blocks of equal size that are compressed separately. At query time only half a block will need to be decompressed on average. Because of decompression overhead, this variant may be slower than classic Bloom filters but this may be compensated by the fact that a single hash function needs to be computed.

 describes an approach called an xor filter, where they store fingerprints in a particular type of perfect hash table, producing a filter which is more memory efficient (formula_47 bits per key) and faster than Bloom or cuckoo filters. (The time saving comes from the fact that a lookup requires exactly three memory accesses, which can all execute in parallel.) However, filter creation is more complex than Bloom and cuckoo filters, and it is not possible to modify the set after creation.

==Extensions and applications==

There are over 60 variants of Bloom filters, many surveys of the field, and a continuing churn of applications (see e.g., Luo, &quot;et al&quot; ). Some of the variants differ sufficiently from the original proposal to be breaches from or forks of the original data structure and its philosophy. A treatment which unifies Bloom filters with other work on random projections, compressive sensing, and locality sensitive hashing remains to be done (though see Dasgupta, &quot;et al&quot; for one attempt inspired by neuroscience).

===Cache filtering===

Content delivery networks deploy web caches around the world to cache and serve web content to users with greater performance and reliability. A key application of Bloom filters is their use in efficiently determining which web objects to store in these web caches. Nearly three-quarters of the URLs accessed from a typical web cache are &quot;one-hit-wonders&quot; that are accessed by users only once and never again. It is clearly wasteful of disk resources to store one-hit-wonders in a web cache, since they will never be accessed again. To prevent caching one-hit-wonders, a Bloom filter is used to keep track of all URLs that are accessed by users. A web object is cached only when it has been accessed at least once before, i.e., the object is cached on its second request. The use of a Bloom filter in this fashion significantly reduces the disk write workload, since most one-hit-wonders are not written to the disk cache. Further, filtering out the one-hit-wonders also saves cache space on disk, increasing the cache hit rates.

===Avoiding false positives in a finite universe===
Kiss &quot;et al&quot; described a new construction for the Bloom filter that avoids false positives in addition to the typical non-existence of false negatives. The construction applies to a finite universe from which set elements are taken. It relies on existing non-adaptive combinatorial group testing scheme by Eppstein, Goodrich and Hirschberg. Unlike the typical Bloom filter, elements are hashed to a bit array through deterministic, fast and simple-to-calculate functions. The maximal set size for which false positives are completely avoided is a function of the universe size and is controlled by the amount of allocated memory.

Alternatively, an initial Bloom filter can be constructed in the standard way and then, with a finite and tractably-enumerable domain, all false positives can be exhaustively found and then a second Bloom filter constructed from that list; false positives in the second filter are similarly handled by constructing a third, and so on. As the universe is finite and the set of false positives strictly shrinks with each step, this procedure results in a finite &quot;cascade&quot; of Bloom filters that (on this closed, finite domain) will produce only true positives and true negatives. To check for membership in the filter cascade, the initial filter is queried, and, if the result is positive, the second filter is then consulted, and so on. This construction is used in CRLite, a proposed certificate revocation status distribution mechanism for the Web PKI, and Certificate Transparency is exploited to close the set of extant certificates.

===Counting Bloom filters===

Counting filters provide a way to implement a &quot;delete&quot; operation on a Bloom filter without recreating the filter afresh. In a counting filter, the array positions (buckets) are extended from being a single bit to being a multibit counter. In fact, regular Bloom filters can be considered as counting filters with a bucket size of one bit. Counting filters were introduced by .

The insert operation is extended to &quot;increment&quot; the value of the buckets, and the lookup operation checks that each of the required buckets is non-zero. The delete operation then consists of decrementing the value of each of the respective buckets.

Arithmetic overflow of the buckets is a problem and the buckets should be sufficiently large to make this case rare. If it does occur then the increment and decrement operations must leave the bucket set to the maximum possible value in order to retain the properties of a Bloom filter.

The size of counters is usually 3 or 4 bits. Hence counting Bloom filters use 3 to 4 times more space than static Bloom filters. In contrast, the data structures of and also allow deletions but use less space than a static Bloom filter.

Another issue with counting filters is limited scalability. Because the counting Bloom filter table cannot be expanded, the maximal number of keys to be stored simultaneously in the filter must be known in advance. Once the designed capacity of the table is exceeded, the false positive rate will grow rapidly as more keys are inserted.

 introduced a data structure based on d-left hashing that is functionally equivalent but uses approximately half as much space as counting Bloom filters. The scalability issue does not occur in this data structure. Once the designed capacity is exceeded, the keys could be reinserted in a new hash table of double size.

The space efficient variant by could also be used to implement counting filters by supporting insertions and deletions.

 introduced a new general method based on variable increments that significantly improves the false positive probability of counting Bloom filters and their variants, while still supporting deletions. Unlike counting Bloom filters, at each element insertion, the hashed counters are incremented by a hashed variable increment instead of a unit increment. To query an element, the exact values of the counters are considered and not just their positiveness. If a sum represented by a counter value cannot be composed of the corresponding variable increment for the queried element, a negative answer can be returned to the query.

Kim et al. (2019) shows that false positive of Counting Bloom filter decreases from k=1 to a point defined formula_48, and increases from formula_48to positive infinity, and finds formula_48as a function of count threshold.

===Decentralized aggregation===
Bloom filters can be organized in distributed data structures to perform fully decentralized computations of aggregate functions. Decentralized aggregation makes collective measurements locally available in every node of a distributed network without involving a centralized computational entity for this purpose.

===Distributed Bloom filters===

Parallel Bloom filters can be implemented to take advantage of the multiple processing elements (PEs) present in parallel shared-nothing machines. One of the main obstacles for a parallel Bloom filter is the organization and communication of the unordered data which is, in general, distributed evenly over all PEs at the initiation or at batch insertions. To order the data two approaches can be used, either resulting in a Bloom filter over all data being stored on each PE, called replicating bloom filter, or the Bloom filter over all data being split into equal parts, each PE storing one part of it. For both approaches a &quot;Single Shot&quot; Bloom filter is used which only calculates one hash, resulting in one flipped bit per element, to reduce the communication volume.

Distributed Bloom filters are initiated by first hashing all elements on their local PE and then sorting them by their hashes locally. This can be done in linear time using e.g. Bucket sort and also allows local duplicate detection. The sorting is used to group the hashes with their assigned PE as separator to create a Bloom filter for each group. After encoding these Bloom filters using e.g. Golomb coding each bloom filter is sent as packet to the PE responsible for the hash values that where inserted into it. A PE p is responsible for all hashes between the values formula_51 and formula_52, where s is the total size of the Bloom filter over all data. Because each element is only hashed once and therefore only a single bit is set, to check if an element was inserted into the Bloom filter only the PE responsible for the hash value of the element needs to be operated on. Single insertion operations can also be done efficiently because the Bloom filter of only one PE has to be changed, compared to Replicating Bloom filters where every PE would have to update its Bloom filter. 
By distributing the global Bloom filter over all PEs instead of storing it separately on each PE the Bloom filters size can be far larger, resulting in a larger capacity and lower false positive rate. 
Distributed Bloom filters can be used to improve duplicate detection algorithms by filtering out the most &#x27;unique&#x27; elements. These can be calculated by communicating only the hashes of elements, not the elements themselves which are far larger in volume, and removing them from the set, reducing the workload for the duplicate detection algorithm used afterwards.

During the communication of the hashes the PEs search for bits that are set in more than one of the receiving packets, as this would mean that two elements had the same hash and therefore could be duplicates. If this occurs a message containing the index of the bit, which is also the hash of the element that could be a duplicate, is sent to the PEs which sent a packet with the set bit. If multiple indices are sent to the same PE by one sender it can be advantageous to encode the indices as well. All elements that didn&#x27;t have their hash sent back are now guaranteed to not be a duplicate and won&#x27;t be evaluated further, for the remaining elements a Repartitioning algorithm can be used. First all the elements that had their hash value sent back are sent to the PE that their hash is responsible for. Any element and its duplicate is now guaranteed to be on the same PE. In the second step each PE uses a sequential algorithm for duplicate detection on the receiving elements, which are only a fraction of the amount of starting elements. By allowing a false positive rate for the duplicates, the communication volume can be reduced further as the PEs don&#x27;t have to send elements with duplicated hashes at all and instead any element with a duplicated hash can simply be marked as a duplicate. As a result, the false positive rate for duplicate detection is the same as the false positive rate of the used bloom filter.

The process of filtering out the most &#x27;unique&#x27; elements can also be repeated multiple times by changing the hash function in each filtering step. If only a single filtering step is used it has to archive a small false positive rate, however if the filtering step is repeated once the first step can allow a higher false positive rate while the latter one has a higher one but also works on less elements as many have already been removed by the earlier filtering step. While using more than two repetitions can reduce the communication volume further if the number of duplicates in a set is small, the payoff for the additional complications is low.

Replicating Bloom filters organize their data by using a well known hypercube algorithm for gossiping, e.g. First each PE calculates the Bloom filter over all local elements and stores it. By repeating a loop where in each step i the PEs send their local Bloom filter over dimension i and merge the Bloom filter they receive over the dimension with their local Bloom filter, it is possible to double the elements each Bloom filter contains in every iteration. After sending and receiving Bloom filters over all formula_53 dimensions each PE contains the global Bloom filter over all elements.

Replicating Bloom filters are more efficient when the number of queries is much larger than the number of elements that the Bloom filter contains, the break even point compared to Distributed Bloom filters is approximately after formula_54 accesses, with formula_55 as the false positive rate of the bloom filter.

===Data synchronization===
Bloom filters can be used for approximate data synchronization as in . Counting Bloom filters can be used to approximate the number of differences between two sets and this approach is described in .

===Bloom filters for streaming data===
Bloom filters can be adapted to the context of streaming data. For instance, proposed Stable Bloom filters, which consist of a counting Bloom filter where insertion of a new element sets the associated counters to a value , and then only a fixed amount of counters are decreased by 1, hence the memory mostly contains information about recent elements (intuitively, one could assume that the lifetime of an element inside a SBF of counters is around formula_56). Another solution is the Aging Bloom filter, that consists of two Bloom filter each occupying half the total available memory: when one filter is full, the second filter is erased and newer elements are then added to this newly empty filter.

However, it has been shown that no matter the filter, after insertions, the sum of the false positive formula_57 and false negative formula_58 probabilities is bounded below by formula_59 where is the amount of all possible elements (the alphabet size), the memory size (in bits), assuming formula_60. This result shows that for big enough and going to infinity, then the lower bound converges to formula_61, which is the characteristic relation of a random filter. Hence, after enough insertions, and if the alphabet is too big to be stored in memory (which is assumed in the context of probabilistic filters), it is impossible for a filter to perform better than randomness. This result can be leveraged by only expecting a filter to operate on a sliding window rather than the whole stream. In this case, the exponent in the formula above is replaced by , which gives a formula that might deviate from 1, if is not too small.

===Bloomier filters===
 designed a generalization of Bloom filters that could associate a value with each element that had been inserted, implementing an associative array. Like Bloom filters, these structures achieve a small space overhead by accepting a small probability of false positives. In the case of &quot;Bloomier filters&quot;, a &quot;false positive&quot; is defined as returning a result when the key is not in the map. The map will never return the wrong value for a key that &quot;is&quot; in the map.
===Compact approximators===
 proposed a lattice-based generalization of Bloom filters. A compact approximator associates to each key an element of a lattice (the standard Bloom filters being the case of the Boolean two-element lattice). Instead of a bit array, they have an array of lattice elements. When adding a new association between a key and an element of the lattice, they compute the maximum of the current contents of the k array locations associated to the key with the lattice element. When reading the value associated to a key, they compute the minimum of the values found in the k locations associated to the key. The resulting value approximates from above the original value.

===Parallel-partitioned Bloom filters===
This implementation used a separate array for each hash function. This method allows for parallel hash calculations for both insertions and inquiries.

===Scalable Bloom filters===
 proposed a variant of Bloom filters that can adapt dynamically to the number of elements stored, while assuring a minimum false positive probability. The technique is based on sequences of standard Bloom filters with increasing capacity and tighter false positive probabilities, so as to ensure that a maximum false positive probability can be set beforehand, regardless of the number of elements to be inserted.

===Spatial Bloom filters===
Spatial Bloom filters (SBF) were originally proposed by as a data structure designed to store location information, especially in the context of cryptographic protocols for location privacy. However, the main characteristic of SBFs is their ability to store multiple sets in a single data structure, which makes them suitable for a number of different application scenarios. Membership of an element to a specific set can be queried, and the false positive probability depends on the set: the first sets to be entered into the filter during construction have higher false positive probabilities than sets entered at the end. This property allows a prioritization of the sets, where sets containing more &quot;important&quot; elements can be preserved.

===Layered Bloom filters===
A layered Bloom filter consists of multiple Bloom filter layers. Layered Bloom filters allow keeping track of how many times an item was added to the Bloom filter by checking how many layers contain the item. With a layered Bloom filter a check operation will normally return the deepest layer number the item was found in.

===Attenuated Bloom filters===
An attenuated Bloom filter of depth D can be viewed as an array of D normal Bloom filters. In the context of service discovery in a network, each node stores regular and attenuated Bloom filters locally. The regular or local Bloom filter indicates which services are offered by the node itself. The attenuated filter of level i indicates which services can be found on nodes that are i-hops away from the current node. The i-th value is constructed by taking a union of local Bloom filters for nodes i-hops away from the node.

For example, consider a small network, shown on the graph below. Say we are searching for a service A whose id hashes to bits 0,1, and 3 (pattern 11010). Let n1 node to be the starting point. First, we check whether service A is offered by n1 by checking its local filter. Since the patterns don&#x27;t match, we check the attenuated Bloom filter in order to determine which node should be the next hop. We see that n2 doesn&#x27;t offer service A but lies on the path to nodes that do. Hence, we move to n2 and repeat the same procedure. We quickly find that n3 offers the service, and hence the destination is located.

By using attenuated Bloom filters consisting of multiple layers, services at more than one hop distance can be discovered while avoiding saturation of the Bloom filter by attenuating (shifting out) bits set by sources further away.

===Chemical structure searching===
Bloom filters are often used to search large chemical structure databases (see chemical similarity). In the simplest case, the elements added to the filter (called a fingerprint in this field) are just the atomic numbers present in the molecule, or a hash based on the atomic number of each atom and the number and type of its bonds. This case is too simple to be useful. More advanced filters also encode atom counts, larger substructure features like carboxyl groups, and graph properties like the number of rings. In hash-based fingerprints, a hash function based on atom and bond properties is used to turn a subgraph into a PRNG seed, and the first output values used to set bits in the Bloom filter.

Molecular fingerprints started in the late 1940s as way to search for chemical structures searched on punched cards. However, it wasn&#x27;t until around 1990 that Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. introduced a hash-based method to generate the bits, rather than use a precomputed table. Unlike the dictionary approach, the hash method can assign bits for substructures which hadn&#x27;t previously been seen. In the early 1990s, the term &quot;fingerprint&quot; was considered different from &quot;structural keys&quot;, but the term has since grown to encompass most molecular characteristics which can be used for a similarity comparison, including structural keys, sparse count fingerprints, and 3D fingerprints. Unlike Bloom filters, the Daylight hash method allows the number of bits assigned per feature to be a function of the feature size, but most implementations of Daylight-like fingerprints use a fixed number of bits per feature, which makes them a Bloom filter. The original Daylight fingerprints could be used for both similarity and screening purposes. Many other fingerprint types, like the popular ECFP2, can be used for similarity but not for screening because they include local environmental characteristics that introduce false negatives when used as a screen. Even if these are constructed with the same mechanism, these are not Bloom filters because they cannot be used to filter.

<text>Thomas Doggett (or Dogget; 20 September 1721) was an Irish actor. The birth date of 1640 seems unlikely. A more probable date of 1670 is given in the Encyclopædia Britannica.

==Biography==
Born in Dublin, he made his first stage appearance in London in 1691 as Nincompoop in Thomas D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s &quot;Love for Money&quot;. In this part, and as Solon in the same author&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage-Hater Matched&quot;, he became popular. He followed Betterton to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, creating the part of Ben, specially written for him, in William Congreve&#x27;s &quot;Love for Love&quot;, with which the theatre opened (1695); and the following year played Young Hobb in his own play, &quot;The Country Wake&quot;. He was associated with Colley Cibber and others in the management of the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, and Drury Lane, and he continued to play comedy parts at the former until his retirement in 1713. Doggett is highly spoken of by his contemporaries, both as an actor and as a man, and is frequently referred to in the &quot;Tatler&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot;.
Doggett is buried in the churchyard of St Johns Church in Eltham High Street, SE9 and a plaque was placed on the outside of the church in his memory.

==Doggett&#x27;s Coat and Badge Prize==
In 1715 Doggett founded the prize of Doggett&#x27;s Coat and Badge in honour of the House of Hanover, in commemoration of King George I of Great Britain&#x27;s accession to the Throne on 1 August 1714. The winner&#x27;s prize is a traditional watermen&#x27;s orange coat with a silver badge added to the sleeve, displaying the white horse of the House of Hanover and Brunswick, with the word &quot;Liberty&quot;. The race had to be rowed annually on August first on the River Thames, by six young watermen who were not to have exceeded the time of their apprenticeship by twelve months. By 1864 the race report comments: The race continues under modified conditions to this day, and is believed to be the oldest continuously contested sporting event. The executors of Doggett&#x27;s will (Sir George Markham and Thomas Reynolds) along with Edward Burt, Chief Clerk at the Admiralty Office, entrusted the management of his prize to the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, although reputed to be a liveryman, of the Fishmongers&#x27; Company, this has yet to be proved. The Company has carried out the instructions in his will to the present day.

<text>A living statue, also known as a human statue, usually refers to a performer who poses as a statue or mannequin, usually with realistic statue-like makeup.

&quot;Living statue&quot; may also refer to art installations created by an artist using living people, or other works created by a performing artist.

== History ==

The tableau vivant, or group of living statues, was a regular feature of medieval and Renaissance festivities and pageantry, such as royal entries by rulers into cities. Typically a group enacting a scene would be mounted on an elaborate stand decorated to look like a monument, placed on the route of the procession.

By a quirk of English law, nudity on the stage was not permitted unless the performers remained motionless while the stage curtains were open. In the early years of the 20th century, performers took advantage of this exception to stage &quot;plastic representations&quot;, as they were sometimes called, centring on nudity. The most persistent performer in this line was the German dancer Olga Desmond, who later put on &quot;Evenings of Beauty&quot; (&quot;Schönheitsabende&quot;) in Germany, in which she posed nude in imitation of classical works of art (&quot;living pictures&quot;). The English tradition continued until the English law was changed in the 1960s. 

A living statue appeared in a scene of the 1945 French film &quot;Les enfants du paradis&quot; (&quot;Children of Paradise&quot;). The London-based artists Gilbert and George created living statues in the 1960s.

==Contemporary use==

Contemporary performances are commonly on-the-street busking but may also be at events where the artist is paid. A living statue attraction, as a performance, is the artist&#x27;s ability to stand motionless and occasionally come to life to comic or startling effect. These performers, also known as human statues, are often completely covered in paint, often gold or silver in colour.

Australian artist Andrew Baines is known for his artworks using living people, often used to convey a social message.

== Events ==

Since 1996, the annual World Statues Festival is held in Arnhem, Netherlands, initially under the name &quot;Rijnfestijn&quot;, now World Living Statues and Statues by Night.

Since 2000, the University of Business and Social Sciences in Buenos Aires, Argentina has hosted a National Contest of Living Statues.

Since 2011, the International Festival of Living Statues has been hosted by Masca Theatre in Bucharest, Romania, where there is a focus on developing the form through artistic research.

The first completely Living Statues Festival started in the city of Espinho, Portugal, in 1997.

<doc id="602220" wikidata="Q4822725" url="?curid=602220" title="Ocean Spray (Manic Street Preachers song)">
<text>&quot;Ocean Spray&quot; is a song by Welsh rock band Manic Street Preachers, released as the third single from their sixth studio album, &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; (2001), on 4 June 2001. James Dean Bradfield wrote both lyrics and music for the song. It reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Background==

The song&#x27;s title was inspired by the cranberry juice drink that James would take in to his mother Sue whilst she was in hospital undergoing treatment for cancer, eventually dying from the disease. It also featured the first recorded lyric written by James. Drummer Sean Moore played a trumpet solo on the song. The CD included &quot;Groundhog Days&quot;, &quot;Just A Kid&quot;, and the &quot;Ocean Spray&quot; video, whereas the cassette included &quot;Little Trolls&quot;.

The &quot;Ocean Spray&quot; video clip also represents a high point in the visibility of the Manics photographer Mitch Ikeda, who appears and speaks the opening Japanese dialogue &quot;&quot; (), which translates as &quot;you have very beautiful eyes... such beautiful eyes&quot;.

==Release==

The song reached number 15 on the UK Singles Chart on 16 June 2001 and spent eight weeks in the top 100. A performance was recorded for that week&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

==Track listings==

<text>The Cyprus Mines Corporation was an early twentieth century American mining company based in Cyprus. In 1914, Charles G. Gunther began prospecting in the Skouriotissa area after reading in ancient books that the island was rich in copper and noticing promising ancient Roman slag heaps in the area. The company was established in 1916 by Colonel Seeley W. Mudd, his son, Harvey Seeley Mudd, and mining engineer/business partner, Philip Wiseman, whose family, along with the Mudds, were the primary owners of Cyprus Mines until the early 1970s when it was sold to Amoco.

==History==
Initially the mine struggled, but eventually obstacles were overcome and the mine produced money. Turkish and Greek Cypriots were hired, and the town of Skouriotissa became a hub as many miners moved there. The corporation took an old-style, paternalistic attitude towards workers, building a company town around the mine. Harvey Seeley Mudd claimed his experience with the Cyprus Mines Corporation influenced him to push the study of humanities in the engineering college he started, Harvey Mudd College. The Cyprus Mines Corporation provided copper to Nazi Germany right up until the start of the World War II. Although the company knew that some of its copper sales to Germany would be used to produce weapons for the Nazi military, at a time before the war when Germany traded for resources with many countries, the owner of the mine argued that stopping those exports would have adversely affected Cyprus. They were, however, disturbed by Hitler&#x27;s policy of Jewish persecution, and in late 1938, CMC established a relief fund along with their agent to help former business associates get out of Germany.

Long strikes took place in 1948, organized by the Pancyprian Federation of Labour and the Turkish Cypriot trade unions. After extending the initial five-day strike, the union asked for government intervention. The government declared that they could not start an inquiry since wages were not substandard. As of 1955, the company&#x27;s copper mines on Cyprus had become the island&#x27;s largest industry, exporting nearly a million tons of copper a year. Mudd&#x27;s copper mines on Cyprus supported 2,000 of the island&#x27;s inhabitants and provided more than 25 percent of the island&#x27;s entire annual revenue. Cyprus Mines paid its employees 15–20 percent above the island average. The company ran an up-to-date, 65-bed hospital for its employees, built scores of low-cost houses for them to live in, and helped to run schools, sports clubs, welfare centers, and summer camps for their families. One of the operating mines and the company&#x27;s processing plant fell north of the cease-fire line in Northern Cyprus following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, whilst the rest of the company&#x27;s mines were the other side of the Green Line. Given this insurmountable problem, the Cyprus Mines Corporation pulled out of Cyprus and the Mavrovouni mine and processing plant remained in an area not controlled by the government of the Republic of Cyprus.
===List of Cyprus Mines===
Over 30 copper deposits, ranging in size from 50,000 to over 20,000,000 tonnes, with grades from 0.3 to 4.5 percent copper have been discovered with most of the mining activity been centered on the following districts:

* Skouriotissa (the oldest operating mine in the world) 
* Tamassos
* Kambia
* Kalavassos
* Limni

A few isolated deposits have also been found at Troulli Mine (Larnaca), Mangaleni (Limassol), Peravasa (Limassol) and Vretchia (Paphos).

===Tailings===
As in most mines, the tailings, waste left over from processing ore, are a problem, although in Cyprus&#x27; case they were also a boon. The discovery and analysis of copper tailings left on Cyprus by Romans had been important factors in the founding of the company and the modern economic development of Cyprus. As of 2006, there are no plans to clean up the tailings. As the company did while it operated, Cyprus prefers to retain the past economic benefits of mining without spending funds on environmental remediation, particularly with no more income from the mines nor the use of the polluted land surrounding those mines, asserting that modern Cyprus has no way to pay for the cleanup. Local farmers claim that citrus crop yields have been reduced by contaminated dust blowing in. Studies of local fruit have found high heavy metal levels and decreased fruit size and quality. The effect of the mine is a growing issue for Cypriot environmentalists and NGOs.

===Emissions===
According to the Climate Accountability Institute, Cyprus Amax was responsible for 0.1% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions up to 2017. 

==Mergers and acquisitions==
In 1979 Cyprus Mines Corporation was acquired by Amoco Corporation. Amoco expanded Cyprus into a diversified worldwide mining company. Amoco spun off Cyprus Minerals Company in 1985. In 1986, Cyprus acquired the Sierrita copper and molybdenum mine near Tucson, Arizona. In July 1988, Cyprus Minerals bought the Inspiration mine and smelting complex in Miami, Arizona. With the expiry of an agreement to purchase electricity at a favorable rate from the Salt River Project, Cyprus Minerals installed an ISASMELT furnace in its copper smelter. This was the first large-scale installation of the ISASMELT process, which was developed jointly by Mount Isa Mines Limited and the Australian government&#x27;s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (&quot;CSIRO&quot;). In 1993, AMAX merged with the Cyprus Minerals Company to form Cyprus Amax Minerals Company. Cyprus-Amax was the world&#x27;s leading producer of molybdenum and lithium, and a leading producer of copper and coal. The company had operations in 24 states and on six continents. In late 1999, Cyprus Amax Minerals was acquired by Phelps Dodge Corporation, which in turn was acquired by Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) in 2007, forming the world&#x27;s largest copper producer.

<text>Ongentheow (Old English: &quot;Ongenþeow&quot;, &quot;Ongenþio&quot;, &quot;Ongendþeow&quot;; Old Norse: &quot;Angantýr&quot;) (died ca. 515) was the name of a semi-legendary Swedish king of the house of Scylfings, who appears in Old English sources.

He is generally identified with the Swedish king Egil Vendelcrow mentioned in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; and in &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;.
The reason why they are thought to have been the same is that each has the same position in the line of Swedish kings and is described as the father of Ohthere and grandfather of Eadgils.

The name Ongentheow contains as its second element &quot;&quot; &quot;servant, slave&quot;. The first appears to be &quot;ongēan&quot; &quot;against, opposite&quot;.

== Old English sources ==

=== &quot;Beowulf&quot; ===

In the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Ongentheow is described as a fearsome warrior, and it took two Geatish warriors Eofor and Wulf Wonreding to take him down.

The epic tells that the Geats under their new king Hæþcyn captured the Swedish queen, but old king Ongenþeow saved her, at a hill fort called Hrefnesholt, although they lost her gold. Ongenþeow killed Hæþcyn, and besieged the Geats at Hrefnesholt. The Geats were, however, rescued by Hygelac, Hæþcyn&#x27;s brother, who arrived the next day with reinforcements. Having lost the battle, but rescued his queen, Ongenþeow and his warriors returned home.

However, the war was not over. Hygelac, the new king of the Geats, attacked the Swedes. The Geatish warriors Eofor and Wulf fought together against the hoary king Ongenþeow. Wulf hit Ongentheow&#x27;s head with his sword so that the old king bled over his hair, but the king hit back and wounded Wulf. Then, Eofor retaliated by cutting through the Swedish king&#x27;s shield and through his helmet, giving Ongentheow a death-blow. Eofor took the Swedish king&#x27;s helmet, sword and mail and carried them to Hygelac. When they came home, Eofor and Wulf were richly rewarded, and Eofor was given Hygelac&#x27;s daughter. Because of this battle, Hygelac is referred to as Ongentheow&#x27;s slayer.

=== &quot;Widsith&quot; ===

Ongentheow is also mentioned in passing by the earlier poem &quot;Widsith&quot; as the king of Sweden:

== Egil ==

In Ari Þorgilsson&#x27;s &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; and in &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot;, he was called Egil Vendelcrow (&quot;Vendilcraca&quot;/&quot;Vendilkráka&quot;, a name traditionally given to those living at the royal estate of Vendel in Sweden). Snorri Sturluson, however, gave the name Vendelcrow to Egil&#x27;s son Ottar (Ohthere). In these sources, Egil was the son of Aun the Old, and like him, not very warlike. After he had made the thrall Tunni (or &quot;Tonne&quot;) responsible for the treasury, Tunni rebelled against Egil. They fought eight battles after which Egil fled to Denmark, according to the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; (&quot;Ynglingatal&quot; does not mention where he fled and &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; does not mention any escape at all). Snorri wrote that Fróði, the Danish king, aided Egil in defeating Tunni, and made Egil a tributary to the Danish king.

Egil was killed by a bull during the sacrifices at Gamla Uppsala.

:Translation: ‘And the famous descendant of Týr &lt;god&gt; [ Swedish king] fled the country before the power of Tunni. And the roamer, the draught-animal of the giant [BULL], which before had long borne the cairn of the brows [HEAD] about the eastern forest, reddened its weapon of the bull [HORN] upon Egill. And the sheathless sword of the bull [HORN] stuck in the heart of the descendant of the Skilfingar [ Swedish king].’

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation:

The even earlier source &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; also cites the line of descent in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and it also gives Egil as the successor of Aunn and the predecessor of Óttarr: &quot;xvi Aun inn gamli. xvii Egill Vendilkráka. xviii Óttarr&quot;.

== Interpretation ==
The argument for connection between Ongenþeow and Egil being the same figure are as follows. It is important, though, to note that this is an interpretation of the facts and not definite proof of a connection.

The two versions seem contradictory, but it has been shown that the two stories may very well describe the same event (Schück H. 1907, Nerman B. 1925), and that &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; was probably misinterpreted by Snorri due to a different dialectal meaning of the word &quot;farra&quot;. &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; says
If there is any authenticity behind the traditions, the origin of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; was most probably a Swedish poem which has not survived (see also Sundquist 2004). In Old Swedish, &quot;farra&quot; did not mean &quot;bull&quot; but it meant &quot;boar&quot; (cf. English &quot;farrow&quot; meaning &quot;young pig&quot;). Moreover, in Old Norse &quot;Trjóna&quot; normally meant a pig&#x27;s snout (modern Scandinavian &quot;tryne&quot;). &quot;Flæmingr&quot; meant &quot;sword&quot; (originally a Flemish sword imported by Vikings).

Moreover, the &quot;sword of the snout&quot; can hardly refer to the horns of a bull, but it is more natural to interpret it as the tusks of a boar. In English, the lines can be translated as &quot;but the giant beast coloured its tusk red on Egil&quot;.

In Old English, the name &quot;eofor&quot; meant &quot;boar&quot; and consequently &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; could very well relate of Eofor (the boar) killing Egil with kennings for boars. These kennings, sung originally by Swedes, were later misinterpreted by Norwegians and Icelanders as literal expressions due to the different dialectal meanings of &quot;farra&quot;.

Moreover, according to Schück, the name &quot;Tunni&quot; which has no meaning in Old Norse should in Proto-Norse have been *&quot;Tunþa&quot; and derived from *&quot;Tunþuz&quot;. Consequently, it would have been the same word as the Gothic &quot;Tunþus&quot; which meant &quot;tooth&quot;. This would mean that the name of Egil&#x27;s enemy, actually meant &quot;tooth&quot; and Tunni and the bull/boar would consequently have been the same enemy, i.e. Eofor.

Some scholars have suggested that the name Ongentheow is connected to the Danish king Ongendus, (&quot;fl.&quot; &quot;c.&quot; 700) who appears in one sentence of Alcuin&#x27;s life of Willibrord.

Located in the southern part of the region, it is bordered by the City of Brussels, Anderlecht, Forest and Ixelles. In common with all of Brussels&#x27; municipalities, it is legally bilingual (French–Dutch), but predominantly French-speaking nowadays.

Saint-Gilles has a multicultural identity stemming from its diverse population. The housing stock varies from semi-derelict tenements near Brussels-South railway station in the north, to elegant bourgeois houses on the southern borders with Uccle and Ixelles, to tourist hotels at the inner end of the Chaussée de Charleroi/Charleroisesteenweg.

==History==

===Beginnings as Obbrussel===
The first houses of the hamlet of &quot;Obbrussel&quot; (, meaning &quot;Upper Brussels&quot;) were built, between the 7th and the 11th centuries, close to the /, one of the points of highest elevation in Brussels, now part of Forest. In 1216, following strong demographic growth in the area, Forest Abbey allowed &quot;Obbrussel&quot; to become an independent parish. This independence, however, was to last only eighty years, after which the administration of the village was given to Brussels. By the 16th century, &quot;Obbrussel&quot; had grown to 41 houses.

In 1670, following orders from the Spanish government, the Count of Monterey built a fort in &quot;Obbrussel&quot; as part of the fortifications of Brussels to protect the City of Brussels against possible attacks. Erected in 1675, this fort was dismantled in the following century to give way to several important toll roads and urban development. The name of the / neighbourhood (literally &quot;Barrier of Saint Gilles&quot;) still commemorates those tolls to this day.

===French Regime until today===
During the French regime, on 31 August 1795, the village, by now called Saint-Gilles after its patron saint and main church, merged with neighbouring villages to form Uccle. Four years later, it gained its independence again, with its own mayor and municipal council. In 1830, Brussels became the capital of newly founded Belgium. As a result, the rural village of Saint-Gilles, known for centuries for its cabbage cultivation, went through an unprecedented construction spree. The population increased from 2,500 around 1800 to more than 33,000 in 1880 to a peak of 60,000 in 1910.

The street pattern was completely remodelled in the 1860s by the architect and urbanist Victor Besme. It was around that time that the Avenue Louise/Louizalaan, Brussels-South railway station, and the new Church of St. Gilles were built, to be followed soon after by the new prison and Municipal Hall. Nowadays, Saint-Gilles is one of the densest municipalities of the Brussels agglomeration.

==Sights==
* Particular architectural delights are found in the dozen or more Art Nouveau houses designed by masters such as Victor Horta and Paul Hankar, dotted around the upper part of the municipality. The house that Horta designed for himself, now the Horta Museum, is located there, on the /. Several of those houses have been recognised as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 2000.
* The imposing Municipal Hall, built between 1900 and 1904, looks larger than it is, and bears a splendid resemblance to a French château with Venetian overtones.
* The extant neo-Gothic prison and the demolished / (former home of the Royal Mint of Belgium) both date from the 1880s, while the Church of St. Gilles was built in 1867.
* There is not a lot of open space in the municipality, although Forest/Vorst Park abuts its western side.

==Statistics==

===Population===
*Nationality: Saint-Gilles has the largest foreign population of any Brussels municipality. Of the 49,933 registered residents in April 2017, 24,046 (48.2%) were non-Belgian. The largest foreign communities are those from France (c. 5,000), Portugal (c. 2,700), Italy and Spain (c. 2,000), Morocco (c. 1,800), Poland (c. 2,600), Romania (c. 2,200), Greece and Germany (c. 500) and Brazil (c. 400).
*Age: The population is relatively young—the average age is 35.95 years—with nearly 10,000 residents under 18 years old, and fewer than average over 65.
*Sex: Saint-Gilles is rare in being home to more men (25,052, 50.2%) than women (24,881, 49.8%).
*Income: The average income per inhabitant lies between €9,000 and €11,500 per year, making it the second-poorest municipality in Brussels (after only Saint-Josse-ten-Noode).

===Economy and labour market===
*Businesses: In December 2014, the municipality was home to 4,452 VAT-registered businesses.
*Employment: 34,050 employees and 4,220 self-employed people worked there. Employment is comparatively fast-growing; it rose by 26% between 2006 and 2013, whereas for the Brussels region as a whole it stood still. The municipality has a high female labour market participation rate; 59% against 68% for men. The employment rate in 2015 was 49%. Unemployment stood at 24.2% in 2015, having fallen from 28.2% in 2005.
*Tourism: Hotel nights have risen by nearly 20% between 2007 and 2015. In that year, 754,429 hotel nights were recorded, of which 584,889 (70%) were foreigners.
*Property prices: Between 2010 and 2014, the average sale price of a flat in Saint-Gilles was €191,381. In 2014, around 500 properties changed hands.
*Rents: Most accommodation in the municipality is rented. The average rent of a two-bedroom flat in 2013 was €669 (as against €732 for Brussels as a whole). There were 1,123 social housing units in 2015.

==Politics==
The local council usually has a socialist majority, and the current mayor is Jean Spinette.

==Education==
The municipality has 13 nursery and primary schools (10 French-speaking and 3 Dutch-speaking) and 7 secondary schools (6 French-speaking and 1 Dutch-speaking).

The Faculty of Architecture, Architectural Engineering and Urban Planning of the University of Louvain (UCLouvain) is established in Saint-Gilles.

==Transport==
Saint-Gilles&#x27;s dense population is well served by public transport. Brussels-South railway station with its international high speed connections sits at the northern tip of the municipal territory, and the underground &quot;premetro&quot; (underground tram) line passes southwards through it. By 2025, the line should have been converted into heavy metro line 3, running from Albert northwards to Gare du Nord/Noordstation (Brussels-North Station), later to be extended to Bordet.

Inhabitants have access to the tram lines 3, 4, 8, 51, 81 and 97, as well as bus lines 48 to Stalle, 134 to St-Job, 136/137 to Alsemberg, 365a to Charleroi and W to Waterloo. There are 5 pods of Cambio shared cars, at Dumont, Horta, Janson, / and /.

==Sports==
Saint-Gilles has a football club called Royal Union Saint Gilloise, which had his prime years in the 1930s. On 13 March 2021, after defeating local rivals R.W.D. Molenbeek, Union was promoted back to the Belgian First Division A, marking its first appearance in top-flight football in 48 years.

<doc id="602257" wikidata="Q6532952" url="?curid=602257" title="Let Robeson Sing">
<text>&quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released in September 2001 by record label Epic as the fourth and final single from their sixth studio album, &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;. It reached number 19 in the UK Singles Chart.

== Content ==

The song is a tribute to the black American actor, singer and civil rights campaigner Paul Robeson. It shares its title with a book by Phil Cope and others, published jointly by the Paul Robeson Cymru Committee and the Bevan Foundation in 2001, with a reprint being published by the National Library of Wales in 2003. All three members of the band – James Dean Bradfield, Sean Moore and Nicky Wire – share the writing credits. &quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot; was the commercial billing used for one of the first remote concerts when Paul Robeson sang live from New York to an audience at the St. Pancras Town Hall in London, held on May 26, 1957 over a newly installed high quality transatlantic telephone cable despite the US government&#x27;s restrictions on his freedom of movement. 

The CD includes the B-sides &quot;Masking Tape&quot;, &quot;Didn&#x27;t My Lord Deliver Daniel&quot; – previously sung by Robeson – and the promotional video. The 12&quot; vinyl edition contained &quot;Fear of Motion&quot; as well as two remixes of the title track, one by Ian Brown and the other by Felix Da Housecat.

== Release ==

&quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot; was released on 10 September 2001 by record label Epic as the fourth and final single from the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;. The single reached number 19 in the UK charts on 22 September 2001, and was their lowest-charting single since &quot;She Is Suffering&quot; reached number 25 in 1994.

On 17 December 2011 &quot;Let Robeson Sing&quot; was the tenth of thirty-eight songs performed at the one-off A Night of National Treasures live performance at The O2 Arena (London). The lead vocals were performed by special guest Gruff Rhys of the Super Furry Animals, with James Dean Bradfield explaining to the audience that Rhys had been set to perform the song at the band&#x27;s 2001 performance in Havana, Cuba, but circumstances had prevented this from happening.

== Video ==
The video was directed by Andrew Dosunmu and filmed at the Paul Robeson Theatre in Brooklyn.

== Track listing ==

All music written and composed by Nick Jones, James Dean Bradfield and Sean Moore.

<text>An LC circuit, also called a resonant circuit, tank circuit, or tuned circuit, is an electric circuit consisting of an inductor, represented by the letter L, and a capacitor, represented by the letter C, connected together. The circuit can act as an electrical resonator, an electrical analogue of a tuning fork, storing energy oscillating at the circuit&#x27;s resonant frequency.
LC circuits are used either for generating signals at a particular frequency, or picking out a signal at a particular frequency from a more complex signal; this function is called a bandpass filter. They are key components in many electronic devices, particularly radio equipment, used in circuits such as oscillators, filters, tuners and frequency mixers.

An LC circuit is an idealized model since it assumes there is no dissipation of energy due to resistance. Any practical implementation of an LC circuit will always include loss resulting from small but non-zero resistance within the components and connecting wires. The purpose of an LC circuit is usually to oscillate with minimal damping, so the resistance is made as low as possible. While no practical circuit is without losses, it is nonetheless instructive to study this ideal form of the circuit to gain understanding and physical intuition. For a circuit model incorporating resistance, see RLC circuit.

==Terminology==
The two-element LC circuit described above is the simplest type of inductor-capacitor network (or LC network). It is also referred to as a &quot;second order LC circuit&quot; to distinguish it from more complicated (higher order) LC networks with more inductors and capacitors. Such LC networks with more than two reactances may have more than one resonant frequency.

The order of the network is the order of the rational function describing the network in the complex frequency variable . Generally, the order is equal to the number of L and C elements in the circuit and in any event cannot exceed this number.

==Operation==
An LC circuit, oscillating at its natural resonant frequency, can store electrical energy. See the animation. A capacitor stores energy in the electric field () between its plates, depending on the voltage across it, and an inductor stores energy in its magnetic field (), depending on the current through it.

If an inductor is connected across a charged capacitor, the voltage across the capacitor will drive a current through the inductor, building up a magnetic field around it. The voltage across the capacitor falls to zero as the charge is used up by the current flow. At this point, the energy stored in the coil&#x27;s magnetic field induces a voltage across the coil, because inductors oppose changes in current. This induced voltage causes a current to begin to recharge the capacitor with a voltage of opposite polarity to its original charge. Due to Faraday&#x27;s law, the EMF which drives the current is caused by a decrease in the magnetic field, thus the energy required to charge the capacitor is extracted from the magnetic field. When the magnetic field is completely dissipated the current will stop and the charge will again be stored in the capacitor, with the opposite polarity as before. Then the cycle will begin again, with the current flowing in the opposite direction through the inductor.

The charge flows back and forth between the plates of the capacitor, through the inductor. The energy oscillates back and forth between the capacitor and the inductor until (if not replenished from an external circuit) internal resistance makes the oscillations die out. The tuned circuit&#x27;s action, known mathematically as a harmonic oscillator, is similar to a pendulum swinging back and forth, or water sloshing back and forth in a tank; for this reason the circuit is also called a &quot;tank circuit&quot;. The natural frequency (that is, the frequency at which it will oscillate when isolated from any other system, as described above) is determined by the capacitance and inductance values. In most applications the tuned circuit is part of a larger circuit which applies alternating current to it, driving continuous oscillations. If the frequency of the applied current is the circuit&#x27;s natural resonant frequency (natural frequency formula_1 below), resonance will occur, and a small driving current can excite large amplitude oscillating voltages and currents. In typical tuned circuits in electronic equipment the oscillations are very fast, from thousands to billions of times per second.

== Resonance effect ==
Resonance occurs when an LC circuit is driven from an external source at an angular frequency at which the inductive and capacitive reactances are equal in magnitude. The frequency at which this equality holds for the particular circuit is called the resonant frequency. The resonant frequency of the LC circuit is

: formula_2

where is the inductance in henries, and is the capacitance in farads. The angular frequency has units of radians per second.

The equivalent frequency in units of hertz is

: formula_3

== Applications ==

The resonance effect of the LC circuit has many important applications in signal processing and communications systems. 
* The most common application of tank circuits is tuning radio transmitters and receivers. For example, when tuning a radio to a particular station, the LC circuits are set at resonance for that particular carrier frequency.
* A series resonant circuit provides voltage magnification.
* A parallel resonant circuit provides current magnification.
* A parallel resonant circuit can be used as load impedance in output circuits of RF amplifiers. Due to high impedance, the gain of amplifier is maximum at resonant frequency.
* Both parallel and series resonant circuits are used in induction heating.

LC circuits behave as electronic resonators, which are a key component in many applications:
* Amplifiers
* Oscillators
* Filters
* Tuners
* Mixers
* Foster–Seeley discriminator
* Contactless cards
* Graphics tablets
* Electronic article surveillance (security tags)

== Time domain solution ==

=== Kirchhoff&#x27;s laws ===
By Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law, the voltage across the capacitor plus the voltage across the inductor must equal zero:

: formula_4

Likewise, by Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law, the current through the capacitor equals the current through the inductor:

: formula_5

From the constitutive relations for the circuit elements, we also know that

: formula_6

=== Differential equation ===
Rearranging and substituting gives the second order differential equation

: formula_7

The parameter , the resonant angular frequency, is defined as

: formula_8

Using this can simplify the differential equation:

: formula_9

The associated Laplace transform is

: formula_10

thus

: formula_11

where is the imaginary unit.

=== Solution ===
Thus, the complete solution to the differential equation is

: formula_12

and can be solved for and by considering the initial conditions. Since the exponential is complex, the solution represents a sinusoidal alternating current. Since the electric current is a physical quantity, it must be real-valued. As a result, it can be shown that the constants and must be complex conjugates:

: formula_13

Now let

: formula_14

Therefore,

: formula_15

Next, we can use Euler&#x27;s formula to obtain a real sinusoid with amplitude , angular frequency , and phase angle formula_16.

Thus, the resulting solution becomes

: formula_17

: formula_18

=== Initial conditions ===
The initial conditions that would satisfy this result are

: formula_19

: formula_20

==Series circuit==
In the series configuration of the LC circuit, the inductor (L) and capacitor (C) are connected in series, as shown here. The total voltage across the open terminals is simply the sum of the voltage across the inductor and the voltage across the capacitor. The current into the positive terminal of the circuit is equal to the current through both the capacitor and the inductor.

: formula_21

=== Resonance ===
Inductive reactance formula_22 increases as frequency increases, while capacitive reactance formula_23 decreases with increase in frequency (defined here as a positive number). At one particular frequency, these two reactances are equal and the voltages across them are equal and opposite in sign; that frequency is called the resonant frequency for the given circuit.

Hence, at resonance,

: formula_24

Solving for , we have

: formula_25

which is defined as the resonant angular frequency of the circuit. Converting angular frequency (in radians per second) into frequency (in Hertz), one has

: formula_26
and
: formula_27
at formula_28.

In a series configuration, and cancel each other out. In real, rather than idealised, components, the current is opposed, mostly by the resistance of the coil windings. Thus, the current supplied to a series resonant circuit is maximal at resonance.
* In the limit as current is maximal. Circuit impedance is minimal. In this state, a circuit is called an &quot;acceptor circuit&quot;
* For    ,    ;   hence, the circuit is capacitive.
* For    ,    ;   hence, the circuit is inductive.

===Impedance===
In the series configuration, resonance occurs when the complex electrical impedance of the circuit approaches zero.

First consider the impedance of the series LC circuit. The total impedance is given by the sum of the inductive and capacitive impedances:

: formula_29

Writing the inductive impedance as and capacitive impedance as and substituting gives

:formula_30

Writing this expression under a common denominator gives

:formula_31

Finally, defining the natural angular frequency as

:formula_32

the impedance becomes

:formula_33

where formula_34 gives the reactance of the inductor at resonance.

The numerator implies that in the limit as , the total impedance will be zero and otherwise non-zero. Therefore the series LC circuit, when connected in series with a load, will act as a band-pass filter having zero impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit.

==Parallel circuit==
When the inductor (L) and capacitor (C) are connected in parallel as shown here, the voltage across the open terminals is equal to both the voltage across the inductor and the voltage across the capacitor. The total current flowing into the positive terminal of the circuit is equal to the sum of the current flowing through the inductor and the current flowing through the capacitor:

: formula_35

=== Resonance ===
When equals , the two branch currents are equal and opposite. They cancel each other out to give minimal current in the main line (in principle, for a finite voltage , there is zero current). Since total current in the main line is minimal, in this state the total impedance is maximal. There is also a larger current circulating in the loop formed by the capacitor and inductor. For a finite voltage , this circulating current is finite, with value given by the respective voltage-current relationships of the capacitor and inductor. However, for a finite total current in the main line, in principle, the circulating current would be infinite. In reality, the circulating current in this case is limited by resistance in the circuit, particularly resistance in the inductor windings.

The resonant frequency is given by
: formula_36

Any branch current is not minimal at resonance, but each is given separately by dividing source voltage () by reactance (). Hence   , as per Ohm&#x27;s law.

* At   , the line current is minimal. The total impedance is maximal. In this state a circuit is called a &quot;rejector circuit&quot;.
* Below   , the circuit is inductive.
* Above   , the circuit is capacitive.

=== Impedance ===

The same analysis may be applied to the parallel LC circuit. The total impedance is then given by

: formula_37

and after substitution of and and simplification, gives

: formula_38

Using

: formula_39

it further simplifies to

: formula_40

Note that

: formula_41

but for all other values of the impedance is finite. 

Thus, the parallel LC circuit connected in series with a load will act as band-stop filter having infinite impedance at the resonant frequency of the LC circuit, while the parallel LC circuit connected in parallel with a load will act as band-pass filter.

==Laplace solution==
The LC circuit can be solved using the Laplace transform.

We begin by defining the relation between current and voltage across the capacitor and inductor in the usual way:

:formula_42 formula_43 and formula_44

Then by application of Kirchhoff&#x27;s laws, we may arrive at the system&#x27;s governing differential equations

:formula_45

With initial conditions formula_46 and formula_47

Making the following definitions,
:formula_48 and formula_49

gives
:formula_50

Now we apply the Laplace transform.
:formula_51
:formula_52
The Laplace transform has turned our differential equation into an algebraic equation. Solving for in the domain (frequency domain) is much simpler viz.
:formula_53
:formula_54

Which can be transformed back to the time domain via the inverse Laplace transform:

:formula_55
:formula_56
For the second summand, an equivalent fraction of formula_28 is needed:
:formula_58

For the second summand, an equivalent fraction of formula_28 is needed:
:formula_60

:formula_61

The final term is dependent on the exact form of the input voltage. Two common cases are the Heaviside step function and a sine wave. For a Heaviside step function we get
:formula_62
:formula_63
:formula_64

For the case of a sinusoidal function as input we get:
:formula_65
where formula_66 is the amplitude and formula_67 the frequency of the applied function.
:formula_68

Using the partial fraction method:
:formula_69

Simplifiying on both sides
:formula_70
:formula_71
:formula_72

We solve the equation for A, B and C:
:formula_73
:formula_74
:formula_75
:formula_76
:formula_77
:formula_78
:formula_79

Substitute the values of A, B and C:
:formula_80

Isolating the constant and using equivalent fractions to adjust for lack of numerator:
:formula_81

Performing the reverse Laplace transform on each summands:
:formula_82
:formula_83
:formula_84

Using initial conditions in the Laplace solution:
:formula_85

== History ==
The first evidence that a capacitor and inductor could produce electrical oscillations was discovered in 1826 by French scientist Felix Savary. He found that when a Leyden jar was discharged through a wire wound around an iron needle, sometimes the needle was left magnetized in one direction and sometimes in the opposite direction. He correctly deduced that this was caused by a damped oscillating discharge current in the wire, which reversed the magnetization of the needle back and forth until it was too small to have an effect, leaving the needle magnetized in a random direction. American physicist Joseph Henry repeated Savary&#x27;s experiment in 1842 and came to the same conclusion, apparently independently.

Irish scientist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1853 showed mathematically that the discharge of a Leyden jar through an inductance should be oscillatory, and derived its resonant frequency. British radio researcher Oliver Lodge, by discharging a large battery of Leyden jars through a long wire, created a tuned circuit with its resonant frequency in the audio range, which produced a musical tone from the spark when it was discharged. In 1857, German physicist Berend Wilhelm Feddersen photographed the spark produced by a resonant Leyden jar circuit in a rotating mirror, providing visible evidence of the oscillations. In 1868, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell calculated the effect of applying an alternating current to a circuit with inductance and capacitance, showing that the response is maximum at the resonant frequency. The first example of an electrical resonance curve was published in 1887 by German physicist Heinrich Hertz in his pioneering paper on the discovery of radio waves, showing the length of spark obtainable from his spark-gap LC resonator detectors as a function of frequency.

One of the first demonstrations of resonance between tuned circuits was Lodge&#x27;s &quot;syntonic jars&quot; experiment around 1889. He placed two resonant circuits next to each other, each consisting of a Leyden jar connected to an adjustable one-turn coil with a spark gap. When a high voltage from an induction coil was applied to one tuned circuit, creating sparks and thus oscillating currents, sparks were excited in the other tuned circuit only when the circuits were adjusted to resonance. Lodge and some English scientists preferred the term &quot;&quot;syntony&quot; for this effect, but the term &quot;resonance&quot;&quot; eventually stuck. The first practical use for LC circuits was in the 1890s in spark-gap radio transmitters to allow the receiver and transmitter to be tuned to the same frequency. The first patent for a radio system that allowed tuning was filed by Lodge in 1897, although the first practical systems were invented in 1900 by Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi.

<doc id="602269" wikidata="Q2608009" url="?curid=602269" title="Eadgils">
<text>Eadgils, &quot;Adils&quot;, &quot;Aðils&quot;, &quot;Adillus&quot;, &quot;Aðísl at Uppsölum&quot;, &quot;Athisl&quot;, &quot;Athislus&quot; or &quot;Adhel&quot; was a semi-legendary king of Sweden, who is estimated to have lived during the 6th century.
&quot;Beowulf&quot; and Old Norse sources present him as the son of Ohthere and as belonging to the ruling Yngling (Scylfing) dynasty. These sources also deal with his war against Onela, which he won with foreign assistance: in &quot;Beowulf&quot; he gained the throne of Sweden by defeating his uncle Onela with Geatish help, and in two Scandinavian sources (&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; and &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;), he is also helped to defeat Onela in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern, but with Danish help. However, Scandinavian sources mostly deal with his interaction with the legendary Danish king Hrólfr Kraki (Hroðulf), and Eadgils is mostly presented in a negative light as a rich and greedy king. Snorri Sturluson, who documented many of the Scandinavian traditions, reported that the Swedes called him a &quot;great king&quot;.

== Name ==
The Norse forms are based on an older (Proto-Norse) *&quot;Aþagīslaz&quot; (where *&quot;aþa&quot; is short for *&quot;&quot; meaning &quot;noble, foremost&quot; (German &#x27;adel&#x27;) and *&quot;&quot; means &quot;arrow shaft&quot;). However, the Anglo-Saxon form is not etymologically identical. The A-S form would have been *&quot;Ædgils&quot;, but &quot;&quot; (Proto-Norse *&quot;Auða-gīslaz&quot;, *&quot;auða-&quot; meaning &quot;wealth&quot;) was the only corresponding name used by the Anglo-Saxons. The name Aðils was so exceedingly rare even in Scandinavia that among almost 6000 Scandinavian runic inscriptions, it is only attested in three runestones (U 35, DR 221 and Br Olsen;215).

== &quot;Beowulf&quot; ==
The Anglo-Saxon epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, composed sometime between the 8th century and the 11th century, is (beside the Norwegian skaldic poem &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; from the 9th century) the oldest source that mentions Eadgils.

The text of &quot;Beowulf&quot; implies that the Swedish king Ohthere died and that his younger brother Onela succeeded him, because Ohthere&#x27;s two sons, Eadgils and Eanmund had to seek refuge with Heardred, Hygelac&#x27;s son and successor as king of the Geats. This caused Onela to attack the Geats, and Heardred was killed. Onela returned home and Beowulf succeeded Heardred as the king of Geatland. In the following lines, Onela is referred to as the &quot;Scylfings&#x27; helmet&quot; and the &quot;son of Ongenþeow&quot;, whereas Eadgils and Eanmund are referred to as the &quot;sons of Ohtere&quot;:

Later in the poem, it tells that during the battle, Eadgils&#x27;s brother Eanmund was killed by Onela&#x27;s champion Weohstan, Wiglaf&#x27;s father. In the following lines, Eanmund also appears as the &quot;son of Ohtere&quot; and as &quot;a brother&#x27;s child&quot;:

Eadgils, however, survived and later, Beowulf helped Eadgils with weapons and warriors. Eadgils won the war and killed his uncle Onela. In the following lines, Eadgils is mentioned by name and as the &quot;son of Ohtere&quot;, whereas Onela is referred to as &quot;the king&quot;:
This event also appears in the Scandinavian sources &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; and &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; – see below.

== Norse sources ==
The allusive manner in which Eadgils and his relatives are referred to in &quot;Beowulf&quot; suggests that the scop expected his audience to have sufficient background knowledge about Eadgils, Ohthere and Eanmund to understand the references. Likewise, in the roughly contemporary Norwegian &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, Eadgils (Aðils) is called &quot;Onela&#x27;s enemy&quot; (Ála dólgr), which likewise suggests that the conflict was familiar to the skald and his audience.

The tradition of Eadgils and Onela resurfaces in several Old Norse works in prose and poetry, and another matter also appears: the animosity between Eadgils and Hrólfr Kraki, who corresponds to Hroðulf in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

=== &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; ===
The skaldic poem &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; is a poetic recital of the line of the Yngling clan. They are also called &quot;Skilfingar&quot; in the poem (in stanza 19), a name that appears in its Anglo-Saxon form &quot;Scylfingas&quot; in &quot;Beowulf&quot; when referring to Eadgils&#x27; clan. It is presented as composed by Þjóðólfr of Hvinir by Snorri Sturluson in the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;.

Although its age has been debated, most scholars hold to date from the 9th century. It survives in two versions: one is found in the Norwegian historical work &quot;Historia Norvegiæ&quot; in Latin, and the other one in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, a part of his &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. It presents Aðils (Eadgils) as the successor of Óttarr (Ohthere) and the predecessor of Eysteinn. The stanza on Aðils refers to his accidental death when he fell from his horse:

:Translation: &quot;I have learned, further, that the creature of charms [SORCERESS] had to destroy the life of Aðils. And the deed-eager descendant of Freyr [= Swedish king] had to fall off the back of the steed. And the sea [fluid] of the brains of the son of the ruler [RULER] was blended with mud. And the deed-fortunate enemy of Áli had to die at Uppsala.&quot;

Note that Eadgils&#x27; animosity with Onela also appears in &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; as Aðils is referred to as &quot;Ole&#x27;s deadly foe&quot; (Ála dólgr). This animosity is treated in more detail in the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, which follow.

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot;, which is a terse summary in Latin of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, only states that Eadgils fell from his horse and died during the sacrifices. In this Latin translation, the Dísir are rendered as the Roman goddess Diana:

The same information is found the &quot;Swedish Chronicle&quot; from the mid-15th century, which calls him &quot;Adhel&quot;. It is probably based on the Ynglingatal tradition and says that he fell from his horse and died while he worshipped his god.

=== &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; ===
In &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; from the early 12th century, Eadgils only appears as a name in the listing of the kings of the Yngling dynasty as Aðísl at Uppsala. The reason what that the author, Ari Þorgilsson, traced his ancestry from Eadgils, and its line of succession is the same as that of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;.

:i Yngvi Tyrkjakonungr. ii Njörðr Svíakonungr. iii Freyr. iiii Fjölnir. sá er dó at Friðfróða. v Svegðir. vi Vanlandi. vii Visburr. viii Dómaldr. ix Dómarr. x Dyggvi. xi Dagr. xii Alrekr. xiii Agni. xiiii Yngvi. xv Jörundr. xvi Aun inn gamli. xvii Egill Vendilkráka. xviii Óttarr. xix Aðísl at Uppsölum. xx Eysteinn. xxi Yngvarr. xxii Braut-Önundr. xxiii Ingjaldr inn illráði. xxiiii Óláfr trételgja...

As can be seen it agrees with the earlier &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; and &quot;Beowulf&quot; in presenting Eadgils as the successor of Óttarr (Ohthere).

=== &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; ===
The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; was a Norse saga which is believed to have been written in the period 1180–1200. The original version is lost, but it survives in a Latin summary by Arngrímur Jónsson.
Arngrímur&#x27;s summary relates that Eadgils, called &quot;Adillus&quot;, married Yrsa with whom he had the daughter Scullda. Some years later, the Danish king Helgo (Halga) attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa, not knowing that she was his own daughter, the result of Helgo raping Olava, the queen of the Saxons. Helgo raped Yrsa as well and took her back to Denmark, where she bore the son Rolfo (Hroðulf). After a few years, Yrsa&#x27;s mother, queen Olava, came to visit her and told her that Helgo was her own father. In horror, Yrsa returned to Adillus, leaving her son behind. Helgo died when Rolfo was eight years old, and Rolfo succeeded him, and ruled together with his uncle Roas (Hroðgar). Not much later, Roas was killed by his half-brothers Rærecus and Frodo, whereupon Rolfo became the sole king of Denmark.

In Sweden, Yrsa and Adillus married Scullda to the king of Öland, Hiørvardus/Hiorvardus/Hevardus (Heoroweard). As her half-brother Rolfo was not consulted about this marriage, he was infuriated and he attacked Öland and made Hiørvardus and his kingdom tributary to Denmark.

After some time, there was animosity between king Adillus of Sweden and the Norwegian king Ale of Oppland. They decided to fight on the ice of Lake Vänern. Adillus won and took his helmet, chainmail and horse. Adillus won because he had requested Rolfo&#x27;s aid against king Ale and Rolfo had sent him his berserkers. However, Adillus refused to pay the expected tribute for the help and so Rolfo came to Uppsala to claim his recompense. After surviving some traps, Rolfo fled with Adillus&#x27; gold, helped by his mother Yrsa. Seeing that the Swedish king and his men pursued him, Rolfo &quot;sowed&quot; the gold on the Fyrisvellir, so that the king&#x27;s men would pick up the gold, instead of continuing the pursuit.

As can be seen, the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; retells the story of Eadgils fighting his uncle Onela, but in this version Onela is no longer Eadgils&#x27; uncle, but a Norwegian king of Oppland. This change is generally considered to be a late confusion between the core province of the Swedes, Uppland, and its Norwegian namesake Oppland. Whereas, &quot;Beowulf&quot; leaves the Danish court with the suspicion that Hroðulf (Rolfo Krage, Hrólfr Kraki) might claim the Danish throne for himself at the death of Hroðgar (Roas, Hróarr), it is exactly what he does in Scandinavian tradition. A notable difference is that, in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Eadgils receives the help of the Geatish king Beowulf against Onela, whereas it is the Danish king Hroðulf who provides help in Scandinavian tradition.

=== &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; ===
&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; was written by Snorri Sturluson, c. 1220, in order to teach the ancient art of kennings to aspiring skalds. It presents Eadgils, called &quot;Aðils&quot;, in two sections.

The first section is the &quot;Kálfsvísa&quot; of which Snorri quotes small parts:
This is a reference to the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern, during which Eadgils slew Onela and which also appears in the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;. There is also second stanza, where Eadgils is riding his horse Slöngvir, apparently a combination famous enough to be mentioned.
Eadgils&#x27; horse Slöngvir also appears in Snorri&#x27;s later work, the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;.

Snorri also presents the story of Aðils and Hrólfr Kraki (Hroðulf) in order to explain why gold was known by the kenning &quot;Kraki&#x27;s seed&quot;. Snorri relates that Aðils was in war with a Norwegian king named Áli (Onela), and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. Aðils was married to Yrsa, the mother of Hrólfr and so sent an embassy to Hrólfr asking him for help against Áli. He would receive three valuable gifts in recompense. Hrólfr was involved in a war against the Saxons and could not come in person but sent his twelve berserkers, including Böðvarr Bjarki. Áli died in the war, and Aðils took Áli&#x27;s helmet &quot;Battle-boar&quot; and his horse Raven. The berserkers demanded three pounds of gold each in pay, and they demanded to choose the gifts that Aðils had promised Hrólfr, that is the two pieces of armour that nothing could pierce: the helmet battle-boar and the mailcoat &quot;Finn&#x27;s heritage&quot;. They also wanted the famous ring Svíagris. Aðils considered the pay outrageous and refused.

When Hrólfr heard that Aðils refused to pay, he set off to Uppsala. They brought the ships to the river Fyris and rode directly to the Swedish king&#x27;s hall at Uppsala with his twelve berserkers. Yrsa welcomed them and led them to their lodgings. Fires were prepared for them and they were given drinks. However, so much wood was heaped on the fires that the clothes started to burn away from their clothes. Hrólfr and his men had enough and threw the courtiers on the fire. Yrsa arrived and gave them a horn full of gold, the ring Svíagris and asked them to flee. As they rode over the Fyrisvellir, they saw Aðils and his men pursuing them. The fleeing men threw the gold on the plain so that the pursuers would stop to collect it. Aðils, however, continued the chase on his horse Slöngvir. Hrólfr then threw Svíagris and saw how Aðils stooped down to pick up the ring with his spear. Hrólfr exclaimed that he had seen the mightiest man in Sweden bend his back.

=== &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; ===
The &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; was written c. 1225 by Snorri Sturluson and he used &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; as a source when he told the story of Aðils. Snorri relates that Aðils succeeded his father Óttar (Ohthere) and betook himself to pillage the Saxons, whose king was Geirþjófr and queen Alof the Great. The king and consort were not at home, and so Aðils and his men plundered their residence at ease driving cattle and captives down to the ships. One of the captives was a remarkably beautiful girl named Yrsa, and Snorri writes that everyone was soon impressed with the well-mannered, pretty and intelligent girl. Most impressed was Aðils who made her his queen.

Some years later, Helgi (Halga), who ruled in Lejre, attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa. As he did not know that Yrsa was his own daughter, he raped her, and took her back to Lejre, where they had a son, Hrólfr kraki. When the boy was three years of age, Yrsa&#x27;s mother, queen Alof of Saxony, came to visit her and told her that her husband Helgi was her own father. Horrified, Yrsa returned to Aðils, leaving her son behind, and stayed in Sweden for the rest of her life. When Hrólfr was eight years old, Helgi died during a war expedition and Hrólfr was proclaimed king.

Aðils waged a war against king Áli (Onela of Oppland), and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. Áli died in this battle. Snorri writes that there was a long account of this battle in the &quot;Skjöldunga Saga&quot;, which also contained an account of how Hrólf came to Uppsala and sowed gold on the Fyrisvellir.

Snorri also relates that Aðils loved good horses and had the best horses in his days (the contemporary Gothic scholar Jordanes noted that the Swedes were famed for their good horses). One horse was named &quot;Slöngvi&quot; and another one &quot;Raven&quot;, which he had taken from Áli. From this horse he had bred a horse also named &quot;Raven&quot; which he sent to king Godgest of Hålogaland, but Godgest could not manage it and fell from it and died, in Omd on the island of Andøya. Aðils himself died in a similar way at the Dísablót. Aðils was riding around the Disa shrine when Raven stumbled and fell, and the king was thrown forward and hit his skull on a stone. The Swedes called him a great king and buried him at Uppsala. He was succeeded by Eysteinn.

=== &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; ===
&quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; is believed to have been written in the period c. 1230 – c. 1450. Helgi and Yrsa lived happily together as husband and wife, not knowing that Yrsa was Helgi&#x27;s daughter. Yrsa&#x27;s mother queen Oluf travelled to Denmark to tell her daughter the truth. Yrsa was shocked and although Helgi wanted their relationship to remain as it was, Yrsa insisted on leaving him to live alone. She was later taken by the Swedish king Aðils as his queen, which made Helgi even more unhappy. Helgi went to Uppsala to fetch her, but was killed by Aðils in battle. In Lejre, he was succeeded by his son Hrólfr Kraki.

After some time, Böðvarr Bjarki encouraged Hrólfr to go Uppsala to claim the gold that Aðils had taken from Helgi after the battle. Hrólfr departed with 120 men and his twelve berserkers and during a rest they were tested by a farmer called Hrani (Odin in disguise) who advised Hrólfr to send back all his troops but his twelve berserkers, as numbers would not help him against Aðils.

They were at first well received, but in his hall, Aðils did his best to stop Hrólfr with pit traps and hidden warriors who attacked the Danes. Finally Aðils entertained them but put them to a test where they had to endure immense heat by a fire. Hrólfr and his berserkers finally had enough and threw the courtiers, who were feeding the fire, into the fire and leapt at Aðils. The Swedish king disappeared through a hollow tree trunk that stood in his hall.

Yrsa admonished Aðils for wanting to kill her son, and went to meet the Danes. She gave them a man named Vöggr to entertain them. This Vöggr remarked that Hrólfr had the thin face of a pole ladder, a &quot;Kraki&quot;. Happy with his new cognomen Hrólfr gave Vöggr a golden ring, and Vöggr swore to avenge Hrólfr if anyone should kill him. Hrólfr and his company were then attacked by a troll in the shape of a boar in the service of Aðils, but Hrólfr&#x27;s dog Gram killed it.

They then found out that Aðils had set the hall on fire, and so they broke out of the hall, only to find themselves surrounded by heavily armed warriors in the street. After a fight, king Aðils retreated to summon reinforcements.

Yrsa then provided her son with a silver drinking horn filled with gold and jewels and a famous ring, Svíagris. Then she gave Hrólfr and his men twelve of the Swedish king&#x27;s best horses, and all the armour and provisions they needed.

Hrólfr bid a fond farewell to his mother and departed over the Fyrisvellir. When they saw Aðils and his warriors in pursuit, they spread the gold behind themselves. Aðils saw his precious Svíagris on the ground and stooped to pick it up with his spear, whereupon Hrólfr cut his back with his sword and screamed in triumph that he had bent the back of the most powerful man in Sweden.

== Danish sources ==

=== &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot; ===
The &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; (and the included &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;) tell that when the Danish kings Helghe (Halga) and Ro (Hroðgar) were dead, the Swedish king Hakon/Athisl forced the Daner to accept a dog as king. The dog king was succeeded by Rolf Krage (Hrólfr Kraki).

=== &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; ===
The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 2), by Saxo Grammaticus, tells that Helgo (Halga) repelled a Swedish invasion, killed the Swedish king Hothbrodd, and made the Swedes pay tribute. However, he committed suicide due to shame for his incestuous relationship with Urse (Yrsa), and his son Roluo (Hrólfr Kraki) succeeded him.

The new king of Sweden, Athislus, thought that the tribute to the Daner might be smaller if he married the Danish king&#x27;s mother and so took Urse for a queen. However, after some time, Urse was so upset with the Swedish king&#x27;s greediness that she thought out a ruse to run away from the king and at the same time liberate him of his wealth. She incited Athislus to rebel against Roluo, and arranged so that Roluo would be invited and promised a wealth in gifts.

At the banquet Roluo was at first not recognised by his mother, but when their fondness was commented on by Athisl, the Swedish king and Roluo made a wager where Roluo would prove his endurance. Roluo was placed in front of a fire that exposed him to such heat that finally a maiden could suffer the sight no more and extinguished the fire. Roluo was greatly recompensed by Athisl for his endurance.

When the banquet had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, early in the morning in carriages where they had put all the Swedish king&#x27;s treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path (later in the work, this is referred to as &quot;sowing the Fyrisvellir&quot;), although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, he bent down to pick it up. Roluo was pleased to see the king of Sweden bent down, and escaped in the ships with his mother.

Roluo later defeated Athislus and gave Sweden to young man named Hiartuar (Heoroweard), who also married Roluo&#x27;s sister Skulde. When Athislus learnt that Hiartuar and Skulde had killed Roluo, he celebrated the occasion, but he drank so much that he killed himself.
== Archaeology ==
According to Snorri Sturluson, Eadgils was buried at Gamla Uppsala. Birger Nerman suggested that he was buried in the Western mound (also known as &quot;Thor&#x27;s mound&quot;) at Gamla Uppsala. An excavation in this mound showed that a man was buried there c. 575 on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. There were luxurious weapons and other objects, both domestic and imported, show that the buried man was very powerful. These remains include a Frankish sword adorned with gold and garnets and a board game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with a costly buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. The finds show the distant contacts of the House of Yngling in the 6th century.

Snorri&#x27;s account that Adils had the best horses of his days, and Jordanes&#x27; account that the Swedes of the 6th century were famed for their horses find support in archaeology. This time was the beginning of the Vendel Age, a time characterised by the appearance of stirrups and a powerful mounted warrior elite in Sweden, with rich graves in for instance Valsgärde and Vendel.

<doc id="602271" wikidata="Q1264654" url="?curid=602271" title="Fine-spotted woodpecker">
<text>The fine-spotted woodpecker (Campethera punctuligera) is a member of the woodpecker family Picidae. It is a widespread and frequently common resident breeder in much of west and central tropical Africa. It is a species associated with open forest, savannah and bush. This bird has a wide range and is a common species, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Description==
This bird is in length. It is a typical woodpecker shape, and has green upper parts marked with fine pale spots, except on the rump and tail, which have pale bars instead. The underparts are whitish or yellowish with fine dark spots on breast, belly and flanks. The head is whitish with greyer cheeks and chin, again with tiny dark spots.

The adult male fine-spotted woodpecker has a red crown and moustachial stripes. Females have a dark forecrown, with red on the rear half. They lack the red moustaches. Young birds are like the female, but the green of the plumage is darker. Like other woodpeckers, this species has a straight pointed bill, a stiff tail to provide support against tree trunks, and zygodactyl or “yoked&quot; feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backward. The long tongue can be darted forward to capture insects. The call of this vocal species is a loud &quot;kip-kip-kip-kiech-kiech-kiech&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The fine-spotted woodpecker is native to the Sudan (region) and adjacent areas. Its habitat is typically wooded savannah, scrub and grassland with scattered &quot;Acacia&quot; and other trees.

==Ecology==
Like other woodpeckers, this species is insectivorous. It is a specialist termite feeder, and is frequently seen near termite mounds and picking insects off trees and the ground. It often forages in small family groups and may join mixed flocks of birds. The nest is built in a tree hole, often in an oil palm, and the clutch consists of two or three white eggs.

<doc id="602275" wikidata="Q450080" url="?curid=602275" title="Little Eva">
<text>Eva Narcissus Boyd (June 29, 1943 – April 10, 2003), known by the stage name of Little Eva, was an American singer, well known for her 1962 hit &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;.

==Biography==
Boyd was born in Belhaven, North Carolina in 1943 and had twelve siblings. At the age of fifteen, she moved to the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, New York. As a teenager, Boyd worked as a maid and earned extra money as a babysitter for songwriters Carole King and Gerry Goffin (including for the young Louise Goffin).

It is often claimed that Goffin and King were amused by Boyd&#x27;s particular dancing style, so they wrote &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; for her and had her record it as a demo (the record was intended for Dee Dee Sharp). However, as King said in an interview with NPR and in her &quot;One to One&quot; concert video, they knew she could sing when they met her, and it would be just a matter of time before they would have her record songs they wrote, the most successful being &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;. Music producer Don Kirshner of Dimension Records was impressed by the song and Boyd&#x27;s voice and had it released. The song reached No. 1 in the United States in 1962. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. 
After the success of &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;, Boyd was stereotyped as a dance-craze singer and was given limited material.

The same year, Goffin and King wrote &quot;He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)&quot; (performed by the Crystals) after discovering that Boyd was being regularly beaten by her boyfriend. When they inquired why she tolerated such treatment, Eva replied without batting an eyelid that her boyfriend&#x27;s actions were motivated by his love for her.
Boyd&#x27;s other single recordings were &quot;Keep Your Hands Off My Baby&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Turkey Trot&quot;, and a remake of the Bing Crosby standard &quot;Swinging on a Star&quot;, recorded with Big Dee Irwin (though Boyd was not credited on the label). Boyd also recorded the song &quot;Makin&#x27; With the Magilla&quot; for an episode of the 1964 Hanna-Barbera cartoon series &quot;The Magilla Gorilla Show&quot;.

In 1963, American Bandstand signed Boyd with Dick Clark&#x27;s Caravan of Stars national U.S. tour and she was set to perform for the tour&#x27;s 15th show, scheduled for the night of November 22, 1963 at the Memorial Auditorium in Dallas, Texas when suddenly the Friday evening event was cancelled, moments after U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while touring Dallas in an open car caravan.
Boyd continued to tour and record throughout the sixties, but her commercial appeal plummeted after 1964. She retired from the music industry in 1971. Boyd never owned the rights to her recordings. Although the prevailing rumor in the 1970s was that she had received only $50 for &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;, it seems $50 was actually her weekly salary at the time she made her records (an increase of $15 from what Goffin and King had been paying her as nanny). Penniless, Boyd returned with her three young children to North Carolina, where they lived in obscurity.

Interviewed in 1988 after the success of the Kylie Minogue recording of &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;, Boyd stated that she did not like the new version; however, its then-current popularity allowed her to make a comeback in show business.

Boyd returned to live performing with other artists of her era on the cabaret and oldies circuits. She also occasionally recorded new songs.

The only existing footage of Little Eva performing &quot;Loco-Motion&quot; is a small clip from the ABC 1960s live show &quot;Shindig!&quot; wherein she sang a short version of the clip along with the famous dance steps. She also sang &quot;Let&#x27;s Turkey Trot&quot; and the Exciters&#x27; song &quot;I Want You to Be My Boy&quot; in the same episode. This TV show was one of Boyd&#x27;s final performances until 1988, when she began performing in concerts with Bobby Vee and other singers. In a 1991 Richard Nader concert, she performed &quot;Loco-Motion&quot; and &quot;Keep Your Hands Off My Baby&quot;. The concert was partially documented on videotape, albeit of marginal quality.

==Death==
Boyd continued performing until she was diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2001. She died on April 10, 2003, in Kinston, North Carolina, at the age of 59, and is buried in a small cemetery in Belhaven, North Carolina. Boyd&#x27;s gravesite was sparsely marked until July 2008, when a report by WRAL-TV of Raleigh, North Carolina, highlighted deteriorating conditions at the cemetery and efforts by the city of Belhaven to have it restored. A simple white cross had marked the site until a new gravestone was unveiled in November of that year. Boyd&#x27;s new grey gravestone has the image of a steam locomotive prominently engraved on the front and the epitaph reads: &quot;Singing with the Angels&quot;.

<text>Hy-Vee, Inc. () is an employee-owned chain of supermarkets in the Midwestern and Southern United States, with more than 280 locations in Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wisconsin, with stores planned in Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama. Hy-Vee was founded in 1930 by Charles Hyde and David Vredenburg in Beaconsfield, Iowa, in a small brick building known as the Beaconsfield Supply Store, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The largest Hy-Vee stores are full-service supermarkets with bakeries, delicatessens, floral departments, dine-in and carryout food service, wine and spirits, pharmacies, salad bars, health clinics, HealthMarkets (natural and organic products) and coffee kiosks (Caribou Coffee and Starbucks). The company maintains fuel stations with convenience stores, fitness centers, and full-service restaurants at some of its properties, including Wahlburgers, a chain made famous by the same-titled A&amp;E reality series. Hy-Vee&#x27;s largest store in the United States opened June 13, 2023, in Gretna, Nebraska (near Omaha), with nearly of retail space. Even larger stores of are planned for Zionsville, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky; the Zionsville store has no set opening date , while the Louisville location expected to open in 2023 was yet to be built as of October 2024.

Hy-Vee&#x27;s longtime advertising slogan, &quot;Where there&#x27;s a helpful smile in every aisle,&quot; was adopted for the chain&#x27;s first television commercial in 1963. In the 1990s, the slogan became a jingle with music by Annie Meacham and James Poulsen. Hy-Vee is known as the &quot;Pride of Des Moines&quot;.

==History==
===Early years and General Supply Company===

Starting in 1917, Vredenburg &amp; Lewis, David Vredenburg&#x27;s previous partnership, operated stores as part of the General Supply Company, an RLDS Church-owned company based in Lamoni, Iowa.

In 1921, Charles Hyde started working for the General Supply Company&#x27;s store in Woodbine, Iowa, which was operated by Vredenburg &amp; Lewis. In 1922, the General Supply Company was formally incorporated. Vredenburg was president and Hyde was a member of the board of directors. In 1924, Hyde left the General Supply Company and started his store in Cameron, Missouri.

In 1927, Hyde purchased a half stake of a store in Kellerton, Iowa, the other half being owned by the General Supply Company. In 1930, Vredenburg and Hyde started a separate partnership from the General Supply Company, named Supply Stores, and opened their first store in Beaconsfield, Iowa.

In 1932, The General Supply Company was dissolved because of the effects of the Great Depression. Vredenburg purchased most of the former General Supply Company&#x27;s remaining stores and mill. Both Hyde and Vredenburg owned and operated other stores outside of their partnership. Hyde and Vredenburg&#x27;s partnership was dissolved for approximately six months in 1935 after Iowa enacted the Chain Tax Act of 1935, a heavy tax against chain stores that was later declared unconstitutional.

In 1938, Hyde &amp; Vredenburg, Inc. was officially incorporated, with 15 stores in Iowa and Missouri. The incorporation consolidated all of Hyde&#x27;s and Vredenburg&#x27;s independently-owned stores with the stores they had in their partnership. The company was headquartered in Lamoni. The new company&#x27;s management plan involved autonomy for store managers, setting the stage for eventual employee ownership.

In 1945, Hyde &amp; Vredenburg moved its corporate headquarters from Lamoni to Chariton, Iowa, after acquiring the Chariton Wholesale Company.

The Supply Store name, with each town&#x27;s name preceding it, was still used on most stores until 1952. A few stores were named differently, such as Hyde&#x27;s Service Store, Vredenburg&#x27;s Grocery, and Hyde &amp; Vredenburg, all changed in 1952.

===1950s and 1960s===
The Hy-Vee name, a portmanteau of Hyde and Vredenburg, was adopted in 1952 as the winning entry of an employee contest, with three employees submitting the name. The first store with the name opened in Fairfield, Iowa, in 1953. In 1956, Hy-Vee introduced its first private-label products and a new logo. In 1957, Hy-Vee opened its first in-store bakery at the Iowa City, Iowa, store.

In 1960, the company became employee-owned by the Employees&#x27; Trust Fund. The slogan &quot;Where There&#x27;s a Helpful Smile in Every Aisle&quot; was first used in a TV commercial in 1963. The company&#x27;s name was officially changed to Hy-Vee Food Stores, Inc., in 1963.

In 1969, Hy-Vee expanded into Minnesota after acquiring the Swanson Stores chain based in Cherokee, Iowa. In 1969, Hy-Vee opened its first Drug Town, a pharmacy separate from a regular store, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. At the end of 1969, Hy-Vee had 66 stores.

===1970s, &#x27;80s, and &#x27;90s===

Hy-Vee continued expanding during the 1970s and 1980s, opening stores in South Dakota (1975), Nebraska (1977), Illinois (1979), and Kansas (1988). In 1975, Hy-Vee&#x27;s 100th store, which was also its first to use electronic cash registers, opened in Keokuk, Iowa. By the end of 1989, Hy-Vee had 172 stores in seven states. In 1994, Hy-Vee updated its logo to the one used today.

In 1995, Hy-Vee moved its corporate headquarters from Chariton to West Des Moines, Iowa and shortened its name to Hy-Vee, Inc. The company&#x27;s primary distribution center is still in Chariton; a second one is in Cherokee, Iowa.

Famous NFL Quarterback Kurt Warner worked at a store in Cedar Falls, Iowa from 1994 to 1995, before going to play in Arena Football for the Iowa Barnstormers.

===2000s===
At the turn of the millennium, Hy-Vee increased its focus on customers&#x27; healthy lifestyles. HealthMarket private-label products were introduced in 2001. The company also began its initiative to provide customers with the services of corporate and in-store dietitians.

Stores began offering an expanded line of ethnic foods to the Midwest&#x27;s increasingly diverse population. Online shopping capabilities expanded in 2005, with a redesigned Hy-Vee website offering online shopping for such items as holiday meals, floral arrangements, and catering selections; gift cards were added in 2006.

Hy-Vee was selected as Progressive Grocer&#x27;s Retailer of the Year in 2003. Drug Town stores were renamed Hy-Vee Drugstores in 2005. Hy-Vee celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2005 with the publication of a second company history book (&quot;The History of Hy-Vee&quot;). In 2007, Hy-Vee&#x27;s first store, in Beaconsfield, Iowa, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the fiscal year 2009, Hy-Vee had sales exceeding $6.3 billion; at the time, it was the second-largest employee-owned company in the United States and ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine the 48th-largest privately owned company in the country. More than 55,000 employees worked in the Hy-Vee family in 2009.

By the end of 2009, there were 228 stores. In 2009, Hy-Vee moved into its eighth state of operations when the store in Madison, Wisconsin opened. In December 2009, Hy-Vee&#x27;s fourth president, Randy Edeker, was selected to lead the company. Ric Jurgens retained the chairman and chief executive officer titles until 2012, when Edeker assumed those roles.

In 2003, Milan, Illinois, based grocer Eagle Food Centers went out of business, and a few of their stores, such as the John Deere Road store in Moline, Illinois, became Hy-Vee stores in the late 2000s.

===2010s===
In 2010, Hy-Vee expressed interest in building/opening a store in Joplin, Missouri, but the plans fell through when the developer would not negotiate traffic signal installation. Despite this, they still remained interested in the area, but according to a Facebook reply in 2016, they have yet to make plans for the Joplin area.

In 2012, Hy-Vee introduced its loyalty program, Hy-Vee Fuel Saver, which allows customers to earn discounts on fuel at Casey&#x27;s General Stores; Shell; PDQ/Kwik Trip, as well as Hy-Vee&#x27;s own gas stations, by purchasing select items.
Later that year, Hy-Vee began adding full-service restaurants to some stores, such as the Hy-Vee Market Grille.

In 2015, Hy-Vee brought online shopping to all stores with the introduction of its new website, Hy-Vee Aisles Online. The company&#x27;s loyalty program adopted Hy-Vee Fuel Saver + Perks branding.

In September 2015, Hy-Vee opened its first stores in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area.

In 2016, Hy-Vee began opening clothing boutiques featuring Tesco&#x27;s F&amp;F brand in select larger locations.

In 2017, Hy-Vee became the exclusive retailer in its service area for sports nutrition products marketed by Mark Wahlberg. This expanded into a deal-making Hy-Vee a franchisee for Wahlburgers restaurants; the first location under the deal opened in May 2018 at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. In 2025, Hy-Vee announced the end of its partnership with Wahlburgers, converting all locations into Market Grille.

Hy-Vee opened its first standalone HealthMarket store in 2018. Much like the in-store health department, also named HealthMarket, the standalone store focuses on health and wellness. The store is a smaller format than regular Hy-Vee stores and contains a pharmacy and attached Orangetheory Fitness.

In 2018, the first-ever Hy-Vee Dollar Fresh store opened up in Osceola, Iowa. This concept offers customers in smaller communities a fresh, new product selection at low prices.

In 2018, the first Hy-Vee Fast &amp; Fresh convenience store opened in Davenport, Iowa. It offered standard pantry and frozen grocery items alongside fresh produce, dairy, meat, and bakery departments. It also had a gas station, online pickup, wood-oven pizzas, sushi, a craft beer station, wine and spirits section, made-to-order meals, take-and-heat meals, meal kits, and a Starbucks with a drive-thru. Unlike other Hy-Vee locations, the convenience store was not open 24/7; in some markets, Hy-Vee Fast &amp; Fresh was meant to compete with Walmart Neighborhood Market, a similar small-store concept launched in 1998.

In 2019, Hy-Vee announced it would open Joe Fresh clothing sections in stores and replace its previous F&amp;F clothing departments.

===2020s===
On January 27, 2020, Hy-Vee agreed to acquire six former Shopko locations in Iowa that will re-open under the Dollar Fresh brand by late summer.

On February 10, 2020, Hy-Vee grocery stores ended 24-hour service at most locations. Most of the 24-hour stores are closed between midnight and 5 a.m., though hours vary by location. The stores still have stock crews working overnight, but the stores are not open to the public.

In September 2021, Hy-Vee opened a 92,989-square-foot flagship store in Grimes, Iowa. The &quot;smart store&quot; contains new technology for Hy-Vee, including scan-and-go shopping, salad-making robot vending machines, digital shelf labels, and self-serve kiosks that allow customers to order bakery items, hot food, or fitness equipment. The store also has experimental ideas including a cigar room, a new design for the hot food area inspired by food halls, fitness equipment from Johnson Fitness &amp; Wellness, redesigned wine and spirits section, DSW shoe department, and nail salon named The W Nail Bar. Also in the same month the chain opened a similar store in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. This location was the first opened in the state outside of the Madison area.

In November 2021, Hy-Vee received several awards from the Technology Association of Iowa at their annual Prometheus Awards ceremony. Hy-Vee won the following awards: CEO of the Year, Creative Technology Solution of the Year, and Software Development Technology Company of the Year.

In December 2021, Hy-Vee expressed interest in a former Shopko location in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin by applying for liquor licenses. The nearly 125,000-square-foot store opened on November 8, 2022, and is the largest in the chain by square footage. It is the fourth location in Wisconsin.

In December 2021, Hy-Vee launched a new subsidiary, RedBox Rx, which provides telehealth online pharmacy services and ships prescriptions directly to patients&#x27; homes.

In December 2021, Hy-Vee announced it would close four locations. Two locations, one in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and one in Moline, Illinois (acquired in the 2000s as part of the Eagle Food Center bankruptcy) will be closed permanently. A store in Kansas City, Missouri will be converted into a Wall to Wall Wine and Spirits location, and another in Sioux Falls, South Dakota will be renovated into a non-retail bakery and pharmacy fulfillment location.

In December 2021, Hy-Vee announced plans to expand into four new states, with plans to open at least 21 new stores by 2025 with seven of these 21 to open no later than 2023, in the following markets: Indianapolis, Louisville, Kentucky, Huntsville, Alabama, Knoxville, Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee, and Memphis, Tennessee. Their primary competitors in the South will be Cincinnati, Ohio-based Kroger and Lakeland, Florida-based Publix. Hy-Vee specified it has no plans to open stores within H-E-B&#x27;s trade territory of Texas. Hy-Vee also plans to build a third distribution center in Nashville, their first outside of Iowa, which will service the seven new stores and southern Missouri. Hy-Vee had originally planned to build a third distribution center in Austin, Minnesota but put those plans on hold indefinitely. 

In December 2021, Hy-Vee expanded its online offering by introducing ship-to-home services. Customers are now able to purchase bulk grocery items directly from the Hy-Vee Deals website, and a pet specific website (Petship) was also launched.

Hy-Vee did not reveal the price, but spokesperson Tina Potthoff said the purchase is one of the largest in Hy-Vee&#x27;s history. Potthoff said privately owned Strack &amp; Van Til will become a subsidiary of Hy-Vee but will retain its logos, name, and branding.

Having previously announced locations in Zionsville and Noblesville for Indiana expansion, Hy-Vee says those timelines for opening may now shift, but are still in the plans for expansion. &quot;We plan to continue to build in these areas,&quot; Potthoff said. &quot;Due to this acquisition, we are reviewing and finalizing our construction timeline for those locations.&quot;

===Information and statistics===
Hy-Vee is known to move departments into separate buildings for legal requirements or optimal customer service. This is commonly seen in the construction of a separate building for Hy-Vee Gas, usually near the main store. It is also common for Hy-Vee to have attached liquor stores, as in Minnesota, where grocery stores are not allowed to sell alcoholic beverages over 3.2% alcohol by weight. In some cases, there is a completely separate building for the liquor department, such as the Prairie Village, Kansas store, where the liquor store is across the street (State Line Road) in Kansas City, Missouri and thus operates under Missouri&#x27;s more liberal alcohol laws.

Hy-Vee ranked second on the National Center for Employee Ownership&#x27;s list of Largest Employee Owned Companies in 2011. Hy-Vee ranked 27th on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual list of the largest privately owned companies in the United States in 2017. Hy-Vee ranked 27th on &quot;Top 75 North American Food Retailers&quot; by Supermarket News in 2016.

Progressive Grocer selected Hy-Vee as its Retailer of the Year in 2017, while Mass Market Retailers appointed Hy-Vee as the 2017 Retail Innovator of the Year.

In 2021, Hy-Vee was ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as the 24th largest privately owned company in the United States.

<text>Yrsa, Yrse, Yrs or Urse (fl. 6th century) was a tragic heroine of early Scandinavian legend. She is typically characterized as the wife of Swedish king Eadgils and mother of Danish king Hrólfr Kraki. 

Her legacy is recorded in several different versions. In all versions, she is regarded as a desirable and charming girl. The general nucleus of her character arc is that incestual sexual relations occur between her and her father, Halga, both of them at first ignorant of their kinship. In most versions, Yrsa is forcibly raped by Halga, and both of them learn later on from Halga&#x27;s Queen Oluf, that they are actually related. This leads to Yrsa leaving Halga, and in one version Halga wants to pursue their incestual relationship regardless. In other versions, Halga commits suicide from the torment of his guilty conscience.

Yrsa&#x27;s saga narrative is connected to King Beowulf&#x27;s narrative. Halga is identified as the younger brother of King Hrothgar who receives aid from Beowulf, and king Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s identity as Halga&#x27;s son is evidenced by the Yrsa tradition. Translators such as Burton Raffel have conjectured an emendment of her name from a corrupt line in the manuscript of &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==Scholarly analysis==
The name &quot;Yrsa&quot; is not known from other Norse sources and may be derived from Latin &quot;Ursus&quot; (&quot;bear&quot;). It has been suggested that if she had any historic antecedent, she may have been Frankish and captured by Danish king Helgi in one of his raids. Scholars have noted chronological inconsistencies, in the traditions on Yrsa, in studies on whether there is a historical background. When Aðils was old enough to marry, Yrsa would already have been rather old, and they would have married for political reasons. According to a theory, she would have been the sister of Helgi, and before marrying Aðils, she would have been the wife of his brother Áli. In this way an emended line in &quot;Beowulf&quot; (1. 62) would be explained.

==In the Icelandic sagas==

===&quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;===
In &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, Helgi (i.e. Halga) went to the Saxons wanting to woo their warlike Queen Oluf. She was, however, not interested and humiliated Helgi by shaving his head and covering him with tar, while he was asleep, and sending him back to his ship. Some time later, Helgi returned and through a ruse, he kidnapped the queen for a while during which time he made her pregnant.

Having returned to her kingdom, the queen bore a child, a girl which she named Yrsa after her dog. Yrsa was sent to live as a shepherd, until she was 12 years old, when she met her father Helgi who fell in love with her, not knowing it was his daughter. Oluf kept quiet about the parentage and saw it as her revenge that Helgi would wed his own daughter. Helgi and Yrsa had the son Hrólfr Kraki (Hroðulf).

Learning that Helgi and Yrsa lived happily together, Queen Oluf travelled to Denmark to tell her daughter the truth. Yrsa was shocked and although Helgi wanted their relationship to remain as it was, Yrsa insisted on leaving him to live alone. She was later taken by the Swedish king Aðils (Eadgils) as his queen, which made Helgi even unhappier.

Missing Yrsa, Helgi went to Uppsala to fetch her, but was killed by Aðils in battle. Yrsa was naturally upset that the man who was closest to her was killed by her husband, and promised Aðils that his berserkers would all be slain if she could help it. She was no happier in the king&#x27;s company and she was not interested in making up with him either. Later, when a young Swedish warrior named Svipdag arrived to test his skills, she greatly supported him in his fights with the berserkers who eventually were all slain. Svipdag chose not to remain with King Eadils and instead he sought service with Yrsa&#x27;s son Hrólfr who had succeeded Helgi as the king of Denmark.

After some time, when Aðils owed Hrólfr not only the gold he had taken from Helgi during the battle, but also tribute for his help fighting king Áli (i.e. Onela of &quot;Beowulf&quot;) in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern, Hrólfr arrived at Uppsala to gather his tribute. Aðils did his best to stop Hrólfr through different ruses, but had to go away to gather reinforcements. While the Swedish king was gone, Yrsa provided her son with more gold than was due to him. Then she gave Hrólfr and his men twelve of the Swedish king&#x27;s best horses (Aðils was famous for his well-bred horses), and all the armour and provisions they needed.

Hrólfr took a fond farewell of his mother and departed over the Fyrisvellir. When they saw Aðils and his warriors in pursuit, they spread the gold behind themselves. Aðils saw his precious Svíagris on the ground and stooped to pick it up with his spear, whereupon Hrólfr cut his back with his sword and screamed in triumph that he had bent the back of the most powerful man in Sweden.

Later, Hrólfr was killed by his brother-in-law Hjörvarðr (i.e. the Heoroweard of &quot;Beowulf&quot;) through treason and when the battle was over Hrólfr&#x27;s sister the half-elven Skuld ruled Denmark. Yrsa exacted revenge by sending a large Swedish army led by Vogg who captured Skuld before she could summon her army. Skuld was tortured to death and Hrólfr&#x27;s daughters took over the rule of Denmark.

This account resembles that of the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, but is more elaborate. A notable difference is that Yrsa is no longer Danish but Saxon, and that Yrsa stayed in Sweden, when her son Hroðulf fled Eadgils with the gold.

===&quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;===
The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; relates that Helgo (Halga) was the king of Denmark together with his brother Roas (Hroðgar). Helgo raped Olava, the queen of the Saxons, and she bore a daughter named Yrsa. The girl later married king Adillus (Eadgils), the king of Sweden. Yrsa and Adillus had the daughter Scullda.

Some years later, Helgo attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa. He raped Yrsa, his own daughter, and took her back to Denmark, where she bore the son Rolfo (Hroðulf). After a few years, Yrsa&#x27;s mother, Queen Olava, came to visit her and told her that Helgo was her own father. In horror, Yrsa returned to Adillus, leaving her son behind. Helgo died when Rolfo was eight years old, and Rolfo succeeded him, and ruled together with his uncle Roas. Not much later, Roas was killed by his half-brothers Rærecus and Frodo (Froda), whereupon Rolfo became the sole king of Denmark.

In Sweden, Yrsa and Adillus married their Scullda to the king of Öland, Hiørvardus (also called &quot;Hiorvardus&quot; and &quot;Hevardus&quot;, and who corresponds to Heoroweard in &quot;Beowulf&quot;). As her half-brother Rolfo was not consulted about this marriage, he was infuriated and he attacked Öland and made Hiørvardus and his kingdom tributary to Denmark.

Adillus requested Rolfo&#x27;s aid against the Norwegian king Ale (Onela). Rolfo sent his berserkers, but when the war had been won, Adillus refused to pay. Rolfo came to Uppsala and after some adventures he could flee with Adillus&#x27; gold, helped by his mother Yrsa, and he &quot;sowed&quot; it on the Fyrisvellir.

This account differs from &quot;Hrólf Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; in the respect that Yrsa was first peacefully married to Eadgils, and later captured by Halga, who raped her and made her pregnant with Hroðulf. In &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, she was first captured by Halga who had Hroðulf with him. Learning that Halga was her father, she returned to Saxland from where Eadgils kidnapped her. In &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot;, Helgi dies when more or less trying to save her from Eagdils, while the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; presents her marriage with Eadgils as a happier one, and Halga died in a different war expedition.

===&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;===
The &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; was used by Snorri Sturluson as a source when he told the story of Aðils (Eadgils) and Yrsa. What remains of the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; is a Latin summary by Arngrímur Jónsson, and so the two versions are basically the same, the main difference being that Arngrímur&#x27;s version is more terse.

Snorri relates that Aðils betook himself to pillage the Saxons, whose king was Geirþjófr and queen Alof the Great. The king and consort were not at home, and so Aðils and his men plundered their residence at ease driving cattle and captives down to the ships. One of the captives was a remarkably beautiful girl named Yrsa, and Snorri writes that everyone was soon impressed with the well-mannered, pretty and intelligent girl. Most impressed was Aðils who made her his queen.

Some years later, Helgi (Halga), who ruled in Lejre, attacked Sweden and captured Yrsa. He raped Yrsa, his own daughter, and took her back to Lejre, where they had a son, Hrólfr (Hroðulf). When the boy was three years of age, Yrsa&#x27;s mother, Queen Alof of Saxony, came to visit her and told her that her husband Helgi was her own father. Horrified, Yrsa returned to Aðils, leaving her son behind, and stayed in Sweden for the rest of her life. When Hrólfr was eight years old, Helgi died during a war expedition and Hrólfr was proclaimed king.

Snorri finishes his account by briefly mentioning that the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; contained an extensive account of how Hrólfr came to Uppsala and sowed gold on the Fyrisvellir.

===&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;===
In the &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Yrsa&#x27;s husband King Aðils (Eadgils) requested Yrsa&#x27;s son Hrólfr&#x27;s help against the Norwegian king Áli (Onela). Hrólfr was busy fighting the Saxons but sent his berserkers.

When Hrólfr heard that Aðils refused to pay, he set off to Uppsala. They brought the ships to the river Fyris and rode directly to the Swedish king&#x27;s hall at Uppsala with his twelve berserkers. Yrsa welcomed them and led them to their lodgings. Fires were prepared for them and they were given drinks. However, so much wood was heaped on the fires that the clothes started to burn away from their bodies. Hrólfr and his men had enough and threw the courtiers on the fire. Yrsa arrived and gave them a horn full of gold, the ring Svíagris and asked them to flee. As they rode over the Fyrisvellir, they saw Aðils and his men pursuing them. The fleeing men threw their gold on the plain so that the pursuers would stop to collect the gold. Aðils, however, continued the chase on his horse Slöngvir. Hrólfr then threw Svíagris and saw how Aðils stooped down to pick up the ring with his spear. Hrólfr exclaimed that he had seen the mightiest man in Sweden bend his back.

===&quot;Gróttasöngr&quot;===
The &quot;Gróttasöngr&quot; contains a stanza (nr 22) sung by the giantesses Fenja and Menja. It only names Yrsa and the situation that her son and brother (i.e. Hroðulf) will avenge Fródi (Froda):
This piece cannot refer to &quot;Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s saga&quot; where Froda was the half-brother of Healfdene because this Froda was killed by Hroðgar. It can, however, be interpreted through the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; in which Hroðulf&#x27;s uncle Hroðgar was murdered by his half-brother Froda.

==In other pre-modern sources==

===&quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;===
The &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; (and the included &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;) tells that one day, the Danish king Helghe arrived in Halland/Lolland and slept with Thore, the daughter of one of Ro&#x27;s farmers. This resulted in Yrse. Much later, he met Yrse, and without knowing that she was his daughter, he made her pregnant with Rolf Krage. Lastly, he found out that Yrse was his own daughter, went east and killed himself.

Ro is the same personage as Hroðgar, who received Beowulf at Heorot. His co-king Helghe is the same as Hroðgar&#x27;s brother Halga, and Rolf Krage is the same personage as Hroðgar&#x27;s nephew Hroðulf. However, in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, it is never explained in what way they were uncle and nephew.

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===
The &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (Book 2) reports that Helgo was the brother of the Danish King Ro, but whereas Ro was king of the Danish lands, Helgo had inherited the sea. One day during his sea roving, arrived at Thurø, where he found and raped the young girl Thora, who became pregnant with Urse. When Helgo, after many years, returned to Thurø, Thora avenged her lost virginity by sending Urse to Helgo who, unknowingly, raped his own daughter. This resulted in Roluo Kraki.

During a Swedish invasion, Ro was killed by Hothbrodd, the King of Sweden. Helgo avenged his brother&#x27;s death and made the Swedes pay tribute. However, he then chose to commit suicide due to his shame for his incestuous relationship with Urse, and their son Roluo Kraki succeeded him. Athislus, the new King of Sweden, thought that the tribute to the Daner might be smaller if he married the Danish king&#x27;s mother, and so took Urse for his queen. However, after some time, Urse was so upset with the Swedish king&#x27;s greediness that she thought out a ruse to run away from the king and at the same time liberate him of his wealth. She incited Athislus to rebel against Roluo, and arranged so that Roluo would be invited and promised a wealth in gifts.

When the banquet had lasted for three days, Urse and Roluo escaped from Uppsala, early in the morning in carriages where they had put all the Swedish king&#x27;s treasure. In order to lessen their burden, and to occupy any pursuing warriors they spread gold in their path, although there was a rumour that she only spread gilded copper. When Athislus, who was pursuing the escapers saw that a precious ring was lying on the ground, he bent down to pick it up. Roluo was pleased to see the King of Sweden bent down, and escaped in the ships with his mother.

This account is more elaborate than that of &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot; and &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot;. Helgo is the same personage as Helghe/Halga. His brother the Danish King Ro is the same as Hroðgar, Roluo is the same as Hroðulf/Rolf Krage, and the Swedish King Athislus is the same as Eadgils, the Swedish king of &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Yrse is here called Urse, and the story of her son fleeing the Swedish king with all his treasure is also found in the following accounts. It is noteworthy that all the Danish sources, &quot;Chronicon Lethrense&quot;, &quot;Annales Lundenses&quot; and &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; differ on where Halga found Yrsa, but make her Danish. The Icelandic sources that follow make her a Saxon, on the other hand, and not Danish.

===&quot;Beowulf&quot;===
The poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; reads (lines 59–63):
  Ðæm feower bearn    forðgerimed&lt;br&gt;
  in worold wocun    weoroda ræswa&lt;br&gt;
  heorogar. 7 hroðgar    7 halga til&lt;br&gt;
  hyrde ic ꝥ    elan cwen&lt;br&gt;
  heaðo-Scilfingas    healsgebedda
This appears in Gummere&#x27;s translation as:
  Then, one after one, there woke to him,&lt;br&gt;
  to the chieftain of clansmen, children four:&lt;br&gt;
  Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave;&lt;br&gt;
  and I heard that – ela&#x27;s queen,&lt;br&gt;
  the Heathoscylfing&#x27;s helpmate dear.
There is obviously something wrong with line 62. A name of a daughter has dropped out, a daughter who was the wife of someone whose name ends in &quot;-ela&quot; and who was Scylfing, i.e. belonging to the royal dynasty of Sweden. It is likely enough that at some time in copying the poem a scribe was unable to make out the exact spelling of these names and so left the text blank at that point to be fixed up later. It was never fixed up and so the names were lost in later copies.

By Old English poetic rules of alliteration the name of the daughter must also begin with a vowel. The choice is usually the name Yrs or Yrse, since Scandinavian tradition speaks much of Yrsa the granddaughter of Healfdene and wife of King Eadgils of Sweden. This assumes great shifting of names and roles, since Eadgils is the enemy of Onela. Onela appears in Norse texts as Áli. Accordingly, many editors and translators prefer to simply note that the line is corrupt. Others like Burton Raffel render the missing passage as Yrs (i.e. Yrsa), and modern commentary sometimes refers to the marriage of Onela and Yrsa without indicating that this exists only through somewhat dubious conjectural emendation.

==In film==
A personage named Yrsa is voiced by Leslie Harter Zemeckis (Robert Zemeckis&#x27; wife) in the 2007 animated version of &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Her only role in the movie is to be courted by the Geatish warrior Hondscio.

<doc id="602291" wikidata="Q7182885" url="?curid=602291" title="Philadelphian Society">
<text>The Philadelphians, or the Philadelphian Society, were a 17th-century English dissenter group. They were organized around John Pordage (1607–1681), an Anglican priest from Bradfield, Berkshire, who had been ejected from his parish in 1655 because of differing views, but then reinstated in 1660 during the English Restoration. Pordage was attracted to the ideas of Jakob Böhme, a Lutheran theosophist and Christian mystic.

==Origins==
A group of followers came to Pordage, including Ann Bathurst and led by Mrs. Jane Leade (1624–1704), who experienced a number of visions and later published them in her book &quot;A Fountain of Gardens&quot;. The group incorporated as The Philadelphian Society for the Advancement of Piety and Divine Philosophy in 1694 (their name was inspired by the Philadelphians mentioned in the Book of Revelation). They rejected the idea of being a church, preferring the term society, and none of the members ceased their memberships in existing churches. Together, the group held views that were somewhat similar to Panentheism, regarding the belief in the presence of God in all things, and with a Nondualist component, in that they also believed the presence of the Holy Spirit exists in each and everyone&#x27;s soul, and that one can become enlightened and illuminated by living a virtuous life and seeking truth through the wisdom of God.

==Basic beliefs==
Leade&#x27;s visions were a central part of the group. Around 1694, she became a Christian Universalist, rejecting the &quot;Doctrine that hath been preached of an endless Misery and Torment&quot; which had &quot;wrought little effect in frightening or terrifying &#x27;em from their evil Courses.&quot; She believed that punishment after death was purgative, not punitive. The group&#x27;s views were spread to continental Europe by Francis Lee, a non-juror at the accession of William III. The group drew up a formal confession of beliefs in 1703. However, after the death of Mrs. Leade in 1704, the group&#x27;s numbers dwindled quickly.

==Influences==
In later years, although no longer officially a functioning group, many of the Philadelphian Society&#x27;s views and writings, particularly those by Leade, remained influential among certain groups of Behmenists, Pietists, Radical Pietists, Christian mystics, and Esoteric Christians, such as the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by Johannes Kelpius), the Ephrata Cloister, and the Harmony Society, among others.

<doc id="602296" wikidata="Q11310714" url="?curid=602296" title="John Alsop">
<text>John Alsop Jr. (1724 – November 22, 1794) was an American merchant and politician from New York City. As a delegate for New York to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776, he signed the 1774 Continental Association.

==Early life==

Alsop was born in 1724 in New Windsor, Orange County in the British Province of New York. He was the son of John Alsop, Sr. and Abigail Sackett. His father was a lawyer in New Windsor and later New York City, where he was largely interested in real estate. His parents married in 1718 and were the parents of four children, including his younger brother, Richard Alsop.

His paternal grandparents were Captain Richard Alsop and Hannah Underhill (1666–1757), who first settled in New York during the 1650s and served as a major in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army, but after a disagreement with the Lord Protector, he fled to the obscurity of colonial life. His great-grandparents were Captain John Underhill and Elizabeth Feake, who was the daughter of Robert Feake and Elizabeth Fones, a descendant of Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. His maternal grandparents were Captain Joseph Sackett and Elizabeth Betts.

==Career==
As a young man he moved to New York City and entered the mercantile world with his brother Richard. The brothers became importers and merchants in cloth and dry goods. Their enterprise prospered, and the Alsops, for several generations, became one of the great merchant houses of the city. John became interested in civic and political activities. He was elected by New York County to serve in the Province of New York Assembly. He was one of the civic leaders that incorporated the New York Hospital Association and served as its first governor from 1770 to 1784. In 1757, his brother Richard retired from business and removed to Middletown, Connecticut.

===American Revolution===
During the first phases of the American Revolution, the Province of New York Assembly could not reach a conclusion about the Continental Congress. As a result, delegates were selected by the revolutionary committees in each county. In 1774, Alsop, along with James Duane, John Jay, Philip Livingston, and Isaac Low, was named as a delegate. When the Congress convened on September 5, Jay presented their credentials, and the Congress accepted. Alsop arrived in Philadelphia on September 14.

As the revolution escalated in 1775, Alsop was one of the leaders of the Committee of Sixty which became the provisional government in New York City. He actively supported the non-importation agreements that he had signed the previous October in the Congress, despite the costs to his business. He was active in recruiting militia and in efforts to equip and arm them. As the Assembly continued to refuse to recognize the national Congress, he was elected to the alternative revolutionary New York Provincial Congress, and they in turn returned him to the Second Continental Congress. Alsop favored reconciliation with Great Britain and so resigned as a delegate to the Congress rather than sign the Declaration of Independence.

1776 was a critical year in the struggle for New York. Alsop began the year at Philadelphia, in a session of Congress. He made several trips between there and New York, acting as an agent of Congress through his business to acquire supplies, and particularly powder for the Continental Army. After General Washington visited Congress in late May, Alsop returned with him to New York in early June. He added efforts to find housing for 8,000 Continental Army troops to his earlier and continuing work on the supply problems. When his home in Newtown was captured by the British in August, he kept working from Manhattan. By September the British had occupied Manhattan as well, ending his effective contributions to the revolution. He escaped to Middletown, Connecticut, and remained there until the British occupation ended in 1783.

===Later years===
After the war he worked to help rebuild the family business and again became active as a civic leader. He was president of New York City&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce in 1784 and 1785.

==Personal life==

On June 6, 1766, he married Mary Frogat (1744–1772) in New York City. They were the parents of one daughter, Mary Alsop (1769–1819), who married Rufus King (1755–1827).

Alsop died at his home in Newtown, Queens County, New York, on November 22, 1794, and is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in Manhattan. His considerable fortune was passed to his daughter and son-in-law after his death.

===Descendants===
His nephew, Richard Alsop (1761–1815), was an author who wrote the &quot;National and Civil History of Chili&quot;, in two volumes, and was one of The Hartford Wits, also known as the Connecticut Wits, who were a group of American writers centered around Yale University and flourished in the 1780s and 1790s. In 1800, Alsop wrote a monody, in heroic verse, on the death of Washington. His son, also Richard Alsop (1790–1842), a partner of W. S. Wetmore, founded the house of Alsop &amp; Co., in Valparaíso, Chile, and Lima, Peru.

Another nephew, Joseph W. Alsop (1772–1844), had a daughter Lucy Alsop, who married Henry Chauncey, of the firm of Alsop &amp; Chauncey, of New York City, who founded the Pacific Mail Steamship Company in 1848. His son, Joseph Wright Alsop, Jr. (1804–1878), was the father of Joseph Wright Alsop III (1838–1891), who was the father of Joseph Wright Alsop IV (1876–1953) who married Corinne Douglas Robinson (1886–1971), a niece of Theodore Roosevelt, and were the parents of Joseph Wright Alsop V (1910–1989) and Stewart Alsop (1914–1974), both American newspaper journalists and political analysts.

<doc id="602315" wikidata="Q7782812" url="?curid=602315" title="There by the Grace of God">
<text>&quot;There by the Grace of God&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 14 October 2002 by record label Epic as a single from the band&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;.

== Content ==

The song is noted for the line &quot;And all the drugs in the world can&#x27;t save us from ourselves&quot;, which is an almost word-for-word quote from Marilyn Manson&#x27;s song &quot;Coma White&quot;, which features the line &quot;And all the drugs in this world can&#x27;t save her from herself&quot;. Manson was previously referred to in the song &quot;The Convalescent&quot; from 2001&#x27;s &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot;, with the line &quot;[...] and Brian Warner has a tasty little ass&quot;.

The CD single includes the B-sides &quot;Automatik Teknicolour&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All Gone&quot;, &quot;Unstoppable Salvation&quot;, &quot;Happy Ending&quot; and the music video for &quot;There by the Grace of God&quot;. A DVD was also released, including the music video for the song and two remixes: Saint Etienne Mix and Starecase Mix.

== Release ==

Epic Records released &quot;There by the Grace of God&quot; on 14 October 2002. The song was featured in the band&#x27;s greatest hits album &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;, released that year. The single reached number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. In Finland it peaked on number 9.

The single received a favourable review by the &quot;NME&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

In a positive review, Mark Beaumont of &quot;NME&quot; hailed the song&#x27;s &quot;icy disco beats and chiming spider-hair guitars&quot; and compared it to Depeche Mode, saying &quot;&#x27;...Grace of God&#x27; is basically &#x27;Enjoy the Silence&#x27; with the tune hacked off, but as a half-arsed filler whacked off to flog a greatest hits it reveals not the irrelevant spent force of &#x27;...Tolerate This&#x27; but rejuvenated musical magpies willing to challenge themselves and their audience again.&quot; Drowned in Sound reviewer Steph saw the song as an attempt by the band to &quot;go electronic,&quot; similarly comparing it to Depeche Mode and New Order. Though she felt the song lacked &quot;some kind of clarity to cut through the cloying wall of sound,&quot; she praised the melody, &quot;glorious wash of sweeping guitars and harsh yet soaring vocals.&quot;

Kevin Courtney of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; wrote that the song &quot;towers above&quot; much of the songs on the band&#x27;s then-latest album &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; (2001), whereas Sputnikmusic reviewer Iai felt it &quot;just doesn&#x27;t stand up to past glories.&quot; Jamie Atkins of &quot;Record Collector&quot; named the song a highlight of &quot;National Treasures – The Complete Singles&quot; (2011), calling it &quot;deliciously gloomy and undersung.&quot; In a review of the same compilation, Sam Shepherd of &quot;Music OMH&quot; cited it among the band&#x27;s best work, calling it &quot;an under appreciated Manics classic.&quot;

== History ==
Charles Rendall, an old boy of Haileybury College, Hertfordshire (1873) and graduate of Oxford University (1879), moved to Australia in 1882, becoming a teacher of Latin and Ancient Greek at Melbourne University, Melbourne Grammar, and later at Scotch College. In 1892, with five staff and 17 students, he opened a new Haileybury campus in Brighton East, Victoria. The school was based on the traditional English public school model with an emphasis on classical texts of Ancient Greece and Rome, and cricket.

Louis Berthon joined Rendall&#x27;s staff in 1894. Due to Rendall&#x27;s continuing health problems, especially after 1906, Berthon was often in charge. Both men regarded a supportive staff/student relationship as paramount. 

In 1932 the third Headmaster, Sydney Dickinson, purchased what was then known as the &#x27;Castlefield&#x27; Estate, in Hampton, Victoria, and from 1932 to 1939, Haileybury used both properties.

Sholto Black became Headmaster in 1942, by which time 190 boys were enrolled at the School. 

Subsequently, David Bradshaw became the new Headmaster and continued the expansion of the school. In 1958, Haileybury was invited to join the Associated Public Schools of Victoria. In 1961 the property &#x27;Newlands&#x27; was purchased in Keysborough by the School Council, and from 1963 to 1968 the Senior School operated at both the Brighton and Keysborough campuses.

Michael Aikman later took over from Bradshaw as Headmaster and continued to develop the Keysborough property. During the 1970s the Preparatory School was built on the &#x27;Newlands&#x27; site and was to run parallel with the Preparatory School &#x27;Castlefield, Brighton&#x27; situated in Hampton. In 1985, land was purchased at Berwick to establish a third Preparatory School. 

Dr. Robert Pargetter took over as Principal in 1998. He introduced to Haileybury the model of Parallel Education, a specialised Pre-Senior (Year 9) Program, a broadening of the curriculum, and the three-year VCE. 

Haileybury opened its first overseas campus outside of Beijing, China in 2013. In 2019, it opened its first interstate campus, located close to Darwin, Australia, named Haileybury Rendall School. Also in 2019, Haileybury was named Australian School of the Year at the Australian Education Awards.

==Headmasters and principals==
==Crest and motto==
Rendall, an alumnus of Haileybury, England, obtained permission from his old school to use its name and badge. The colours he chose were magenta and black instead of the magenta and white of the parent school; and for the motto he chose &#x27;Altera Terra&#x27; to signify the establishment of a new Haileybury &#x27;in another land&#x27;.

In 1954, the school decided to couple the motto of Haileybury, England, &#x27;Sursum Corda&#x27; (&#x27;Lift up your hearts&#x27;) to the original &#x27;Altera Terra&#x27;.

<text>Florence Jessie Collinson MacWilliams (4 January 1917 – 27 May 1990) was an English mathematician who contributed to the field of coding theory, and was one of the first women to publish in the field. MacWilliams&#x27; thesis &quot;Combinatorial Problems of Elementary Group Theory&quot; (or &quot;Combinatorial Problems of Elementary Abelian Groups&quot;) contains one of the most important combinatorial results in coding theory, which is now known as the MacWilliams Identity.

==Education and career==
MacWilliams was born in Stoke-on-Trent, England and studied at the University of Cambridge, receiving her BA in 1938 and her MA in the following year. She moved to the United States in 1939 and studied at Johns Hopkins University. One year later she left Johns Hopkins for Harvard University.

In 1955 she became a programmer and learned coding theory at Bell Labs where she spent most of her career. Although she did major research at Bell Labs, she was denied a promotion to a mathematics research position until she received a Ph.D. She would proceed to fulfill some of the PhD&#x27;s requirements while working at Bell Labs and taking care of her family, but she completed her PhD after returning to Harvard for one more year (1961–1962), under the supervision of Andrew Gleason. MacWilliams worked with Gleason to produce her thesis entitled &quot;Combinatorial Problems of Elementary Group Theory&quot;. Both MacWilliams and her daughter Anne, who later obtained a PhD in Mathematics, were studying mathematics at Harvard that year.

==Contributions==
Her formula is known as the MacWilliams identity, and is how MacWilliams is known. MacWilliams&#x27; result was later critical in proving an important bound on code rate, called the &#x27;linear programming bound&#x27;.

From 1962 to 1976, Macwilliams produced important results on algebraic constructions and combinatorial properties of codes. She worked on cyclic codes, generalizing them to Abelian group codes. With H.B. Mann, MacWilliams gave a solution to a difficult problem involving certain design matrices, which they published in their paper titled &quot;On the &quot;p&quot;-rank of the design matrix of a difference set&quot;.

One of MacWilliams&#x27; significant achievements was her encyclopedic book, &quot;The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes&quot;, which she wrote in collaboration with Neil Sloane and was published in 1977. The book is stated as being &quot;Perhaps the most comprehensive text on the algebraic and combinatorial properties of error-correcting codes, and of abiding interest to both mathematicians and engineers. It was one of the major works responsible for laying the foundation for a revolution in communication technology that is being played out even today&quot;.

==Recognition==
In 1980 she was the first Noether Lecturer.

<doc id="602335" wikidata="Q36344" url="?curid=602335" title="Ongota language">
<text>Ongota (also known as Birale, Birayle) is a moribund language of southwest Ethiopia. UNESCO reported in 2012 that out of a total ethnic population of 115, only 12 elderly native speakers remained, the rest of their small village on the west bank of the Weito River having adopted the Tsamai language instead. The default word order is subject–object–verb. The classification of the language is obscure (Sava &amp; Tosco 2015).

==History of the people==


Oral history of the Ongota tells that they originated from a number of different populations from Dikinte, Maale and Arbore among others. During a stay in Maale territory, which today lies at their north, the collection of clans were chased south due to their hunting of Maale livestock. They followed the banks of the Weito River until they reached the Arbore, where they were turned away back north and settled where they are today. This account differs from that of the Maale, who claim that the Ongota were originally a part of the Maale who migrated and did not return.

==Classification==
Ongota has features of both Afroasiatic and Nilo-Saharan languages that confuse its classification, and linguists and anthropologists have been unable to clearly trace its linguistic roots so far. Savà and Tosco (2007) claim that Ongota&#x27;s morphology is Ts&#x27;amakko and that ~50% of the lexicon can be connected to Ts&#x27;amakko roots. They also report that Aklilu Yilma of Addis Ababa University considers Ongota to be a pidginised creole. They state that this &quot;conclusion is strengthened by a local legend stating that Ongota originated from a multiethnic melting pot.&quot; They further report that Lionel Bender considers Ongota to be Cushitic, Václav Blažek (1991, 2001, and forth.) Nilo-Saharan, and Cushiticist Maarten Mous mentions it as a language isolate. Savà and Tosco (2003, 2007), themselves, believe it to be an East Cushitic language with a Nilo-Saharan substratum—that is, that Ongota speakers shifted to East Cushitic from an earlier Nilo-Saharan language, traces of which still remain. Fleming (2006) considers it to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic. Bonny Sands (2009) believes Savà and Tosco&#x27;s proposal to be the most convincing proposal. Sava &amp; Tosco (2015) leave it unclassified, possibly an isolate but possibly so affected by superstrate influence that the original affiliation of the language has been obscured. Dimmendaal (2011; 2020) considers Ongota a linguistic isolate that underwent heavy influence from neighboring languages, a position that is also shared by Güldemann (2018).

==Phonology==

Additionally, Ongota distinguishes between high and low tone.

==Decline==
The main mechanism behind the decline of Ongota is marriage with other communities. In a brief expedition in the early 1990s, a number of researchers made the observation that many Ongota men married Tsamakko women. The child would grow up speaking only the mother&#x27;s language, but not the father&#x27;s. (Mikesh, P. et al., 1992–1993) This trend has continued through the recent years.

<doc id="602336" wikidata="Q1402591" url="?curid=602336" title="Ohthere">
<text>Ohthere, also Ohtere (Old Norse: &quot;Óttarr vendilkráka&quot;, &quot;Vendelcrow&quot;; in modern Swedish &quot;Ottar Vendelkråka&quot;), was a semi-legendary king of Sweden of the house of Scylfings, who is said to have lived during the Germanic Heroic Age, possibly during the early 6th century (fl. c. 515 – c. 530). 

His name can be reconstructed as Proto-Norse *&quot;Ōhta-harjaz&quot; or *&quot;Ōhtu-harjaz&quot;. The &quot;harjaz&quot; element is common in Germanic names and has a meaning of &quot;warrior, army&quot; (whence English &quot;harry&quot;); by contrast, the &quot;oht&quot; element is less frequent, and has been tentatively interpreted as &quot;fearsome, feared&quot;.

A prince of the Swedes, Ohthere and his brother Onela conducted successful raids against the Geats after King Hrethel had died. In 515, their father Ongentheow was killed in battle by the Geats, and Ohthere succeeded his father as the king of Sweden. Ohthere led an army against the Geats, and besieged one of their armies. He nearly killed the Geatish king Hygelac but lost many of his forces in the conflict. Ohthere managed to get back to Sweden. In the 520s, Ohthere led a large raid to Denmark and plundered the Danish coast. A Danish army led by two Jarls, however, was waiting for him. Battle broke out. The Danish were reinforced, and Ohthere was killed in the battle. His corpse was taken back to Sweden and buried in an earthwork mound.

==&quot;Beowulf&quot;==
In the Old English poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the name of Ohthere appears only in constructions referring to his father Ongenþeow (&quot;fæder Ohtheres&quot;), mother (&quot;Onelan modor and Ohtheres&quot;), and his sons Eadgils (&quot;suna Ohteres&quot;, &quot;sunu Ohteres&quot;) and Eanmund (&quot;suna Ohteres&quot;).

When Ohthere and his actions are concerned, he is referred to as &quot;Ongenþeow&#x27;s offspring&quot;, together with his brother Onela. The following section deals with Ohthere and Onela pillaging the Geats at the death of their king Hreðel, restarting the Swedish-Geatish wars:

Later, it is implied in the poem that Ohthere has died, because his brother Onela is king. Ohthere&#x27;s sons Eadgils and Eanmund fled to the Geats and the wars began anew.

== Scandinavian sources ==
&quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Íslendingabók&quot;, and &quot;Historia Norvegiae&quot; all present Óttarr as the son of Egill (called Ongenþeow in &quot;Beowulf&quot;) and as the father of Aðísl/Aðils/athils/Adils (Eadgils).

According to the latest source, &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Óttarr refused to pay tribute to the Danish king Fróði for the help that his father had received. When Fróði sent two men to collect the tribute, Óttarr answered that the Swedes had never paid tribute to the Danes and would not begin with him. Fróði gathered a vast host and looted in Sweden, but the next summer he pillaged in the east. When Óttarr learnt that Fróði was gone, he sailed to Denmark to plunder in return and went into the Limfjord where he pillaged in Vendsyssel. Fróði&#x27;s jarls Vott and Faste attacked Óttarr in the fjord. The battle was even and many men fell, but the Danes were reinforced by the people in the neighbourhood and so the Swedes lost (a version apparently borrowed from the death of Óttarr&#x27;s predecessor Jorund). The Danes put Óttarr&#x27;s corpse on a mound to be devoured by wild beasts, and made a wooden crow that they sent to Sweden, with the message that the wooden crow was all that Óttarr was worth. After this, Óttarr was called &quot;Vendelcrow&quot;.

It is only Snorri who uses the epithet Vendelcrow, whereas the older sources &quot;Historia Norvegiae&quot; and &quot;Íslendingabók&quot; use it for his father Egill. Moreover, only Snorri&#x27;s work tells the story of Óttarr&#x27;s death in Vendsyssel, and it is probably his own invention. &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; mentions only that Óttarr was killed by the Danish jarls Vott and Faste in a place named &quot;Vendel&quot; (Laing has been influenced by Snorri&#x27;s version in his translation):
The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation (continuing after Egil):

&quot;Historia Norvegiæ&quot; informs only that Ohthere was killed by the Danish brothers &quot;Ottar&quot; [sic.] and Faste in a Danish province called &quot;Vendel&quot;.

==Ohthere&#x27;s Barrow==
Ohthere&#x27;s barrow (Swedish: &quot;Ottarshögen&quot;) () is located in Vendel parish, Uppland, Sweden. The barrow is 5 metres high and 40 metres wide. In the 17th century, the barrow was known locally as &quot;Ottarshögen&quot;. The term Hög is derived from the Old Norse word &quot;haugr&quot;, meaning mound or barrow.

The barrow was excavated in the period 1914–16. It showed the remains of both a man and a woman, and the finds were worthy of a king. The Swedish archaeologist Sune Lindqvist reported that in its centre, there was a wooden vessel with ashes. There were few finds but they were well-preserved. There were some decorative panels similar to those found in the other Vendel era graves nearby. A comb with a case was found, as well as a golden Roman coin, a solidus, dated to be no later than 477. It had been perforated and was probably used as decoration, but it showed signs of wear and tear and had probably been worn for a longer time. Lindqvist stated that the identification of the barrow as that of Ohthere could not receive more archaeological confirmation than those provided by the excavation.

<doc id="602344" wikidata="Q314105" url="?curid=602344" title="Damdin Sükhbaatar">
<text>Damdin Sükhbaatar (2 February 1893 – 20 February 1923) was a Mongolian communist revolutionary, founding member of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party, and leader of the Mongolian partisan army that took Khüree during the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921. For his part in the Outer Mongolian revolution of 1921, he was enshrined as the &quot;Father of Mongolia&#x27;s Revolution&quot;.

==Early life==
Sükhbaatar (literally &quot;Axe Hero&quot; in Mongolian) was born in present-day Ulaanbaatar, the Chinese trading settlement some kilometers east of Ikh Khüree (later Niislel Khüree, now Ulaanbaatar), as the third of four children. His parents had deserted their home banner in Setsen Khan aimag, and his father lived from odd jobs and as a day laborer. When Sükhbaatar was six, the family moved close to the Russian consulate. It was from playing with the Russian children that he learnt to speak some Russian. At the age of 14, Sükhbaatar had the opportunity to get an education, from Zaisan Jamyan. From the age of 16 onwards, he worked as a proxy rider (at that time, people who were obliged to render certain services to the authorities often employed other people to replace them) for several years. After Mongolia&#x27;s first declaration of independence in 1911, Sükhbaatar was drafted into the new nation&#x27;s army.

== In the Bogd Khan&#x27;s army ==
In 1912, Russian advisers to the Bogd Khan set up a military school at Khujirbulan, and Sükhbaatar was one of the soldiers transferred there. His talent for military tactics and his skills at riding and shooting earned him the respect of his comrades, and after the training he became a platoon leader of the machine gun company at Khujirbulan. In 1913, he set up his own household with his wife Yanjmaa. They had had their first son in 1911, but Yanjmaa&#x27;s parents objected to the relationship on the grounds that Sükhbaatar was too poor.

In late June 1914, Sükhbaatar was involved in a soldiers&#x27; riot against the bad living conditions and corruption in the army, but this episode seems to have had no negative repercussions for him. The so-called autonomous period was a rather unruly one, and in 1917 Sükhbaatar was deployed to Mongolia&#x27;s eastern border, under the command of Khatanbaatar Magsarjav. In 1918, the Mongolian government set up a printing office for printing law codes and Buddhist texts, and Sükhbaatar was transferred there. The office was led by Jamyan, so one reason for this transfer may have been that Sükhbaatar&#x27;s name had been forwarded by his old teacher. Another reason may have been that Sükhbaatar&#x27;s superiors wanted to keep him apart from the other soldiers.

== Chinese occupation ==
Between 1918 and 1919, as Russia struggled with revolution and civil war in the aftermath of World War I, the Chinese moved to reassert their rule of Outer Mongolia. Some nobles began negotiations with the Chinese amban Chen Yi on the subject of abolishing Mongolia&#x27;s autonomy, and in autumn 1919 General Xu Shuzheng occupied Niislel Khüree and forced the Bogd Khan to sign an edict that incorporated Mongolia into the Republic of China. At about the same time, two secret groups that would later evolve into the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party were founded, and Sükhbaatar was a member of one of them. After the Chinese takeover, the printing office was closed and the army dispersed, so Sükhbaatar became jobless.

The two secret groups united in early 1920, and began putting up posters in which they criticized the new rulers. They began gathering intelligence on the Chinese forces in Khüree, and on the attitudes of the Bogd Khan, other high lamas, and the upper nobles, towards the Chinese. Also, they established contacts with some revolutionaries among Khüree&#x27;s Russian community. In mid-1920, several Comintern agents convinced the secret group to send a delegation to Irkutsk. Consequently, the group was renamed the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party on June 25, 1920, and lots were drawn to see who would travel to Russia to obtain Soviet support. Danzan and Choibalsan left in early July, Bodoo and Chagdarjav followed in mid-July. On July 25, the remaining group succeeded, via Da Lama Puntsagdorj, in obtaining a letter in which the Bogd Khan asked Soviet Russia for support against the Chinese. With this letter, Sükhbaatar, Darizavyn Losol, and Dansranbilegiin Dogsom left for Russia in late July, 1921. Sükhbaatar was in charge of smuggling the Bogd Khan&#x27;s letter through the Chinese checkpoints, and the hollowed handle of his whip he used for this purpose is today displayed in a museum in Ulaanbaatar.

==People&#x27;s Revolution==

By August 19, 1920, the Mongolian delegates had all reached Irkutsk and met with a representative of the Soviet Russian Government, named Gapon. Gapon relayed that Soviet Russia was ready to help Mongolia, but that the delegates should explain what kind of government they wanted to establish, how they would fight against the foreign enemy, and what their future policy would be like. In early September, Danzan, Losol, and Chagdarjav were sent on to Moscow via Omsk, while Sükhbaatar and Choibalsan were to remain in Irkutsk for military training and to maintain contact between the delegation in Moscow and Mongolia. Bodoo and Dogsom were sent back to Khüree.
In the meantime, the Chinese had imprisoned a number of members and sympathizers of the secret group. In late 1920, White Russian forces under Lieutenant General Baron Ungern had entered Mongolia from the east, and in late February 1921 occupied Niislel Khüree. Choibalsan and Chagdarjav were sent back into Mongolia to establish contacts with nationalist-minded nobles and other leaders. On February 9, Sükhbaatar was appointed commander-in-chief of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Partisans. He began recruiting soldiers, and on February 20 the partisans had their first engagement with Chinese troops, followed by other encounters in the following days. At the founding congress of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party (MPP) at Kyakhta on March 1–13, 1921, Sükhbaatar was again appointed commander-in-chief and elected into the newly established provisional government.
Immediately after the congress, the provisional government and the MPP central committee decided to seize the Mongolian part of Khiagt from the Chinese troops, and on February 15 an ultimatum was sent to the Chinese military authorities in the town. The Chinese commanders refused to surrender, and on March 18, Sükhbaatar&#x27;s troops succeeded in taking the town, despite being heavily outnumbered. This day is now the official holiday of Mongolia&#x27;s army, and is usually celebrated as the equivalent of Defender of the Fatherland Day in Russia. The provisional government moved to the Mongolian part of Khiagt and began to establish Ministries of the Army, Finances and Foreign Affairs, but when a fire in the aftermath of the battle burnt down the greater part of the town, the government moved on to Altanbulag.

At the end of May 1921, Khiagt came under pressure from Baron Ungern&#x27;s forces, who moved towards Soviet Russia. This offensive was repulsed by mid-June, with the help of troops of the Far Eastern Republic. At the end of June, the People&#x27;s Partisans and the Red Army decided to attack Khüree. They reached the town on July 6, having destroyed smaller groups of Ungern&#x27;s forces on the way.

On July 11, a new government was proclaimed, with Sükhbaatar becoming Minister of the Army and the Bogd Khan&#x27;s powers limited to those of a rather symbolic nature.
== Death ==
The new government was not in a secure position, and rumours of anti-communist plots increased. In 1922, Bodoo, Chagdarjav, Da Lama Puntsagdorj and others were executed on allegations that they had collaborated with internal and external enemies of the new state. In early 1923, amid official suspicions that a coup was planned for Tsagaan Sar, the state of alert became too exhausting for Sükhbaatar. He broke down on the night of February 14/15, and died on February 20. In the 1940s under Choibalsan&#x27;s reign, it was alleged that Sükhbaatar had been poisoned, but later socialist publications did not explicitly discuss the cause of death. Nonetheless, this version is still somewhat popular in Mongolia. Some historians say that he died of pneumonia, because of cold rain. Neither version could be proved officially.

Elbeg Rinchino, the then-chairman of the Military Council, the highest authority in Mongolia, presided over his funeral and burial services. Mongolia&#x27;s capital was renamed Ulaanbaatar (&quot;Red Hero&quot;) in 1924. The Order of Sukhbaatar became the highest decoration of the Mongolian state. In 1954, he was exhumed from his grave at Altan-Ölgii National Cemetery and reinterred in the newly built mausoleum at Sükhbaatar Square. When the mausoleum was dismantled in 2005, he was cremated and his ashes buried in Altan-Ölgii again. His cremation was supervised by Buddhist monks.

Sükhbaatar&#x27;s widow Yanjmaa went on to serve in a number of senior positions in the Mongolian government, including acting president.

== Commemorations ==
* A statue of Sükhbaatar stands at Sükhbaatar Square in front of the government building in Ulaanbaatar today.
* Other places named after Sükhbaatar include Sükhbaatar Province, the capital of Selenge Province, and a district of Ulaanbaatar.
* The Sukhe-Bator Officers&#x27; School was named after him.
* Mongolian bank notes between 5 and 100 tögrög (1993 series) feature an image of Sükhbaatar, with higher denomination notes bearing the portrait of Genghis Khan.
* His Name Is Sukhe-Bator (1942) Soviet Mongolian drama film directed by Iosif Kheifits and Aleksandr Zarkhi.
*&quot;Ulaan Tug&quot; (, literally &quot;Red Banner&quot;) is a Mongolian revolutionary song that was penned by Sukhbaatar. It was first heard being sung by soldiers, with Sukhbaatar explaining to painter Nicholas Roerich that he had composed during the 1915 Mongolia–China conflict. It was later adapted by Colonel Navaany Tserenpil (known as the &quot;Mongolian March King&quot;) for parade. The march is one of the signature marches of the Military Band of the Mongolian General Staff, used during ceremonies such as the unfurling of the national flag or unit colours.

<doc id="602346" wikidata="Q7235928" url="?curid=602346" title="PowWow (chat program)">
<text>PowWow was the first Internet instant message and chat program for Windows. It was made by a company called Tribal Voice, Inc.

==Features==
Many of the features found in contemporary instant messaging programs were first introduced in PowWow. The program also had several innovative features such as allowing users to talk with each other using VoIP, a shared whiteboard, a built-in speech synthesizer, WAV sound file playing, offline transmittal of instant messages via POP/SMTP, and the ability for users to share their web surfing experience concurrently by redirecting either party to a new URL when another navigates elsewhere. It also had built-in file transfer with a simple drag-and-drop interface to make file sharing very easy.

==History==
The company was founded in Woodland Park, Colorado, United States, at the end of 1994, by the software millionaire John McAfee, founder of McAfee Associates (later called McAfee or Intel Security Group). At first, the company described itself, especially on its web site, as a &#x27;Native American&#x27; company run by Native Americans. As the company grew, the Native American references gradually disappeared.

The company eventually located its corporate headquarters in Scotts Valley, California.

In the late 1990s, Tribal Voice began to OEM the PowWow software in order to increase market share. While most of these deals were insubstantial, several were with high-profile companies, including AT&amp;T&#x27;s WorldNet Internet service provider (ISP), search engine/portal AltaVista, and Freeserve, a United Kingdom-based ISP.

PowWow was one of the first instant messaging programs to provide interoperability between multiple instant messaging clients, being compatible with both AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and Microsoft&#x27;s MSN Messenger.

In the late 1990s, AOL sued Tribal Voice for use of the phrase &#x27;buddy list&#x27; and made repeated efforts to block interoperability between their instant messaging client and Tribal Voice&#x27;s, as well as those of other companies.

In 1998, original founder McAfee brought in Joseph Esposito, formerly the president and CEO of Encyclopædia Britannica, to run the company.

In 1999, the company was acquired by dot-com incubator CMGI, who moved the company&#x27;s development center from Woodland Park to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and closed the Scotts Valley office. In 2000, CMGI merged the company into CMGIon, a division of CMGI, founded with help from Sun Microsystems and Novell. In January 2001, CMGIon closed its Colorado Springs office, the former Tribal Voice.

In late 2000, Tribal Voice announced PowWow will end on January 19th, 2001 because it couldn&#x27;t attract new users. They stated &quot;Please be advised that PowWow will no longer be supported as of January 19th, 2001. The PowWow instant messaging product, services and communities will not be available following that date. Please take the time to find a new service before January 19, 2001, to ensure no disruption in your instant messaging, chat and community services.&quot;

<text>The United Kingdom consists of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and previously consisted of Great Britain and the whole of Ireland. Rail transport systems developed independently on the two islands of Great Britain and Ireland, and most of the railway construction in the Republic of Ireland was undertaken before independence in 1922. Thus, the logical division to discuss the history of railways in these areas is by geographical division, rather than the political division of nation states.

<doc id="602354" wikidata="Q976683" url="?curid=602354" title="Matthew Henson">
<text>Matthew Alexander Henson (August 8, 1866March 9, 1955) was an African American explorer who accompanied Robert Peary on seven voyages to the Arctic over a period of nearly 23 years. They spent a total of 18 years on expeditions together. He is best known for his participation in the 1908–1909 expedition that claimed to have reached the geographic North Pole on April 6, 1909. Henson said he was the first of their party to reach the North Pole.

Henson was born in Nanjemoy, Maryland, to sharecropper parents who were free Black Americans before the Civil War. He spent most of his early life in Washington, D.C., but left school at the age of twelve to work as a cabin boy. He later returned to Washington and worked as a salesclerk at a department store. One of his customers was Robert Peary, who in 1887 hired him as a personal valet. At the time, Peary was working on the Nicaragua Canal.

Their first Arctic expedition together was in 1891–92. Henson served as a navigator and craftsman, and was known as Peary&#x27;s &quot;first man&quot;. Like Peary, he studied Inuit survival techniques.

During their 1908–09 expedition to Greenland, Henson was one of the six men – including Peary and four Inuit assistants – who claimed to have been the first to reach the geographic North Pole. In interviews, Henson identified as the first member of the party to reach what they believed was the pole. The team&#x27;s claim had gained widespread acceptance, but, in 1989, Wally Herbert published research that found that their expedition records were unreliable and indicated an implausibly high speed during their final rush for the pole, and that the men could have fallen short of the pole due to navigational errors.

Henson achieved a degree of fame as a result of participating in the expedition, and in 1912, he published a memoir titled &quot;A Negro Explorer at the North Pole&quot;. As he approached old age, his exploits received renewed attention. In 1937, he was the first African American to be made a life member of The Explorers Club; in 1948, he was elevated to the club&#x27;s highest level of membership. In 1944, Henson was awarded the Peary Polar Expedition Medal, and he was received at the White House by Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. In 1988, he and his wife were re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery. In 2000, Henson posthumously was awarded the Hubbard Medal by the National Geographic Society. In September 2021, the International Astronomical Union named a lunar crater after him.

==Early life and education==
Henson was born on August 8, 1866, on his parents&#x27; farm east of the Potomac River in Charles County, Maryland to sharecroppers who had been free people of color before the American Civil War. Matthew&#x27;s parents were subjected to attacks by the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, who terrorized southern freedmen and former free people of color after the Civil War.

To escape from racial violence in southern Maryland, the Henson family sold the farm in 1867 and moved to Georgetown, then still an independent town adjacent to the national capital. He had an older sister S., born in 1864, and two younger sisters Eliza and M. Matthew&#x27;s mother died when Matthew was seven. His father Lemuel remarried to a woman named Caroline and had additional children with her, including daughters and a son.

After his father died, Matthew was sent to live with his uncle, who lived in Washington, D.C. (Georgetown was made part of Washington, DC in 1871.) The uncle paid for a few years of education for Matthew but soon died. Henson attended a Black public school for the next six years, during the last of which he took a summer job washing dishes in a restaurant. His early years were marked by one especially memorable event. When he was 10 years old, he went to a ceremony honoring Abraham Lincoln, the American president who had fought so hard to preserve the Union during the Civil War and had issued the proclamation that had freed slaves in the occupied Confederate states in 1863. At the ceremony, Matthew was greatly inspired by a speech given by Frederick Douglass, an escaped slave and renowned orator, the longtime leading figure in the Black American community. Douglass called upon Black people to vigorously pursue educational opportunities and battle racial prejudice.

At the age of 12, the youth made his way to Baltimore, Maryland, a busy port. He went to sea as a cabin boy on the merchant ship &quot;Katie Hines,&quot; traveling to ports in China, Japan, Africa, and the Russian Arctic seas. The ship&#x27;s leader, Captain Childs, took Henson under his wing and taught him to read and write.

==Exploration==

While working at a Washington D.C. clothing store, B.H. Stinemetz and Sons, in November 1887, Henson met Commander Robert E. Peary. Learning of Henson&#x27;s sea experience, Peary recruited him as an aide for his planned voyage and surveying expedition to Nicaragua, with four other men. Peary supervised 45 engineers on the canal survey in Nicaragua. Impressed with Henson&#x27;s seamanship on that voyage, Peary recruited him as a colleague and he became &quot;first man&quot; in his expeditions.

After that, for more than 20 years, their expeditions were to the Arctic. Henson traded with the Inuit and mastered the Inuit language; they called him &quot;Mahri-Pahluk.&quot; He was remembered as the only non-Inuit who became skilled in driving the dog sleds and in training dog teams in the Inuit way. He was a skilled craftsman, often coming up with solutions for what the team needed in the harsh Arctic conditions; they learned to build igloos out of snow, for mobile housing as they traveled. His and Peary&#x27;s teams covered thousands of miles in dog sleds and reached the &quot;Farthest North&quot; point of any Arctic expedition until 1909.

===1908–09 expedition===

In 1908–09, Peary mounted his eighth attempt to reach the North Pole. The expedition was large, as Peary planned to use his system of setting up cached supplies along the way. When he and Henson boarded his ship &quot;Roosevelt&quot;, leaving Greenland on August 18, 1909, they were accompanied by

Peary selected Henson and four Inuit as part of the team of six men who would make the final run to the Pole. Before the goal was reached, Peary could no longer continue on foot and rode in a dog sled. Various accounts say he was ill, was exhausted, or had frozen toes. He sent Henson ahead as a scout.

In a newspaper interview, Henson later said:
 Henson proceeded to plant the American flag.

The claim by Peary&#x27;s team to have reached the North Pole was widely debated in newspapers at the time, as was the competing claim by Frederick Cook. The National Geographic Society as well as the Naval Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives both credited Peary&#x27;s team with having reached the North Pole. Others remained doubtful. A reassessment of Peary&#x27;s notebook by British polar explorer Wally Herbert in 1988 found it &quot;lacking in essential data&quot;, thus, renewing doubts about Peary&#x27;s claim.

==Later life==

In 1912 Henson published a memoir about his arctic explorations, &quot;A Negro Explorer at the North Pole&quot;. In this, he describes himself as a &quot;general assistant, skilled craftsperson, interpreter, and laborer.&quot; He later collaborated with author Bradley Robinson on his 1947 biography, &quot;Dark Companion&quot;, which told more about his life. 

During the following decades, Admiral Peary received many honors for leading the expedition to the Pole, but Henson&#x27;s contributions were largely ignored. In 1909 he was honored at dinners within the black community. Henson spent most of the next 30 years working on staff in the U.S. Customs House in New York, at the suggestion of Theodore Roosevelt.

He later gained renewed attention. In 1937 Henson was admitted as a member to the prestigious Explorers Club in New York City, and in 1948 he was made an honorary member, of whom there are only 20 per year. In 1944 Congress awarded him and five other Peary aides duplicates of the Peary Polar Expedition Medal, a silver medal given to Peary. Presidents Truman and Eisenhower both honored Henson before he died in 1955.

Henson died in the Bronx, New York on March 9, 1955, at the age of 88. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery and survived by his wife Lucy. After her death in 1968, she was buried with him. In 1988, both their bodies were moved for reinterment at Arlington National Cemetery, accompanied by a commemoration ceremony.

==Family==
Henson married Eva Flint in 1891, but their marriage did not survive their long periods of separation, and they divorced in 1897. He later married Lucy Ross in New York City on September 7, 1907. They had no children.

During the extended expeditions to Greenland, Henson and Peary both took Inuit women as &quot;country wives&quot; and fathered children with them. With his concubine, known as Akatingwah, Henson fathered his only child, a son named Anauakaq, born in 1906. Anauakaq&#x27;s children are Henson&#x27;s only descendants. After 1909, Henson never saw Akatingwah or his son again; other explorers sometimes updated him about them. The existence of Henson&#x27;s and Peary&#x27;s descendants first was made public by French explorer and ethnologist Jean Malaurie who spent a year in Greenland in 1951–1952.

S. Allen Counter, a neuroscientist and director of the Harvard Foundation, had been interested in Henson&#x27;s story and traveled in Greenland for research related to it. Learning of possible descendants of the explorers, he tracked down Henson&#x27;s and Peary&#x27;s sons, Anauakaq and Kali, respectively in 1986. By then the men were octogenarians. He arranged a visit for them the following year to the United States, where they met American relatives from both families and visited their fathers&#x27; graves. Anauakaq died in 1987. He and his wife Aviaq had five sons and a daughter, who have children of their own. While some still reside in Greenland, others have moved to Sweden or the United States.

Several Inuit family members returned to Washington, D.C., in 1988 for the ceremony of reinterment of Henson and his wife Lucy at Arlington National Cemetery. Counter had petitioned President Ronald Reagan for this honor to gain recognition of Henson&#x27;s contributions to Arctic exploration. Counter wrote a book about his finding Anauakaq and Kali, his research on Henson&#x27;s life and contributions, historical racial relations, and the Inuits&#x27; meeting with Henson and Peary relatives in the United States, entitled &quot;North Pole Legacy: Black, White and Eskimo&quot; (1991). The material was adapted and produced as a film documentary by the same name.

===Extended family===
Matthew Henson&#x27;s only descendants were the children of his Inuit son and their children. According to S. Allen Counter, in his lifetime Henson had identified families of two nieces as being part of his extended birth family. They were Virginia Carter Brannum, daughter of Henson&#x27;s sister Eliza Henson Carter of Washington, D.C., and Olive Henson Fulton of Boston, daughter of his half-brother. In a 1988 article, Counter noted that these two women had letters and photographs certifying their kinship. They were the only family members to attend Henson&#x27;s funeral in 1955, along with his widow Lucy Ross Henson. Counter later recommended to the United States Navy and the National Geographic Society that Audrey Mebane, daughter of Virginia Brannum, and Olive Henson Fulton be designated as family representatives for any ceremonies honoring Henson.

Henson is believed to be a great-great-granduncle of actress Taraji P. Henson.

<text>The flamebacks or goldenbacks are large woodpeckers which are resident breeders in tropical southern Asia. They derive their English names from their golden or crimson backs.

However, the two flameback genera &quot;Dinopium&quot; and &quot;Chrysocolaptes&quot; are not particularly close relatives. The former are close to the enigmatic &quot;Meiglyptes&quot; and possibly &quot;Hemicircus&quot; woodpeckers, and the recently reclassified rufous woodpecker (&quot;Micropternus brachyurus&quot;). &quot;Chrysocolaptes&quot; on the other hand appears to be a rather close relative of &quot;Campephilus&quot;, the genus of the famous ivory-billed woodpecker (&quot;C. principalis&quot;).

<text>Onondaga is an unincorporated community in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located within Onondaga Township in Ingham County. As an unincorporated community, Onondaga has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own but does have its own post office with the 49264 ZIP Code. The Onondaga 49264 ZIP Code serves the majority of the township, as well as smaller areas in Hamlin Township to the west and Tompkins Township to the south.

The community is centered along the Grand River approximately south of Lansing and northwest of Jackson.

==History==

European-American settlement began in the mid-19th century, with most migrants coming from New England and New York. The township and community were named after the Iroquois nation of Onondaga, historically based in New York. A post office was first established at the place about 1844, with Perez Howland as the first postmaster. In 1847, Perez Howland built a grocery. A post office was operated from the grocery. Cyrus Baldwin subsequently purchased the building and converted it into the &quot;Onondaga Hotel&quot;.

The first store of any consequence in the place was established in 1867 by John Sherman. The European-American plat of the village of Onondaga was laid out by John Sherman and others, on July 13, 1870. Several buildings had previously been erected, but the place dates its permanent growth from this time.

It was also about that date that the Grand River Valley division of the Michigan Central Railroad was built through the town, which brought more settlers and businesses Sherman donated land for the depot.

The first church, called the First Congregational Church of Onondaga, was built in 1877.

Onondaga is the city of license for Lansing&#x27;s NBC affiliate WILX-TV, and has its transmitter just west of the community.

<text>Chrysocolaptes is a genus of birds in the woodpecker family Picidae that are found in South and Southeast Asia.

The genus was introduced by English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1843. The type species was subsequently designated as the Javan flameback (&quot;Chrysocolaptes strictus&quot;) by Scottish ornithologist Edward Hargitt in 1890. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;khrusos&quot; meaning &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;kolaptēs&quot; meaning &quot;chiseller&quot;. The genus belongs to the tribe Campephilini in the subfamily Picinae and is sister to the orange-backed woodpecker, the only species in the genus &quot;Reinwardtipicus&quot;.
==Species==
The genus contains ten species:

<text>Dinopium is a genus of birds in the woodpecker family Picidae. The species are found in South and Southeast Asia.

The genus was introduced by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1814 to accommodate the common flameback (&quot;Dinopium javanense&quot;). The name combines the Classical Greek meaning &quot;mighty&quot; or &quot;huge&quot; and &quot;ōps/ōpos&quot; meaning &quot;appearance&quot;.

A large phylogenetic study of the woodpecker family Picidae published in 2017 found that the genus was paraphyletic. The olive-backed woodpecker (&quot;Dinopium rafflesii&quot;) is more closely related to the pale-headed woodpecker (&quot;Gecinulus grantia&quot;) than it is to other members of the genus &quot;Dinopium&quot;.

==Species==
As presently constituted, the genus contains the following 5 species:

<doc id="602369" wikidata="Q1815782" url="?curid=602369" title="Lord of the manor">
<text>Lord of the manor is a title that, in Anglo-Saxon England and Norman England, referred to the landholder of a historical rural estate. The titles date to the English feudal (specifically Baronial) system. The lord enjoyed manorial rights (the rights to establish and occupy a residence, known as the manor house and demesne) as well as seignory, the right to grant or draw benefit from the estate (for example, as a landlord). The title is not a peerage or title of upper nobility (although the holder of could also be peer) but was a relationship to land and how it could be used and those living on the land (tenants) may be deployed, and the broad estate and its inhabitants administered. The title continues in modern England and Wales as a legally recognised form of property that can be held independently of its historical rights. It may belong entirely to one person or be a moiety shared with other people. The title is known as in Welsh.

In the British Crown Dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey the equivalent title is Seigneur.

A similar concept of such a lordship is known in French as Sieur or , in German, (Kaleagasi) in Turkish, in Norwegian and Swedish, in Dutch, and or in Italian.

==Background==
The manor formed the basic unit of land ownership within the baronial system. Initially in England the feudal &quot;baronial&quot; system considered all those who held land directly from the king by knight-service, from earls downwards, as &quot;barons&quot;. Others forms of land tenure under the feudal system included serjeanty (a form of tenure in return for a specified duty other than standard knight-service) and socage (payment of a fee). Under King Henry II, the already distinguished between greater barons (who held their baronies &quot;per baroniam&quot; by knight-service), and lesser barons (who owned the manor without knight-service). As they held their title due to ownership of manors, and not &quot;per baroniam&quot; knights service, Lords of the Manor were in the group of lesser barons. The entitlement or &quot;title&quot; to attend the King&#x27;s Council in parliament began to be granted exclusively by decree in the form of a writ of Summons from 1265 entrenching the status of the Greater Barons and effectively founding the House of Lords.

Magna Carta (which had been first issued in 1215) had declared that &quot;No free man shall be seized, imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, exiled or ruined in any way, nor in any way proceeded against, except by the lawful judgement of his peers&quot;, and thus this body of greater Barons with a right to attend parliament were deemed to be &quot;peers&quot; of one another, and it became the norm to refer to these magnates collectively as the &quot;peerage&quot; during the reign of Edward II. Meanwhile the holders of smaller fiefdoms &quot;per baroniam&quot; ceased to be summoned to parliament, and instead lesser barons of each county would receive a single summons as a group through the sheriff, and representatives from their number would be elected to attend on behalf of the group (this would later evolve into the House of Commons). This meant the official political importance of ownership of manors declined, eventually resulting in baronial status becoming a &quot;personal&quot; title rather than one linked to ownership of territory. The lesser Baronial titles, including Lordships of the Manor, therefore were not incorporated into the peerage. It is understood that all English Feudal Baronies that were not Lordships of the Manor and had not been upgraded into a peerage, were abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, passed after the Restoration, which took away knight-service and other legal rights. This left Lordships of the Manor as the sole vestige of the English feudal system. Like their English counterparts, by 1600 manorial titles in the formerly Norman territories in France and Italy did not ennoble their holders in the same way as did, for example, a barony in these territories.

Lordships of the Manor often have certain feudal era rights associated with them. The exact rights that each manor holds will be different: the right to hold a market, a right over certain waterways or mineral deposits are all within scope.

==Types==

Historically a lord of the manor could either be a tenant-in-chief if he held a capital manor directly from the Crown, or a mesne lord if he was the vassal of another lord. The origins of the lordship of manors arose in the Anglo-Saxon system of manorialism. Following the Norman conquest, land at the manorial level was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 (the Normans&#x27; registry in Sicily was called, in Latin, the &quot;Catalogus Baronum&quot;, compiled a few years later). The title cannot nowadays be subdivided. This has been prohibited since 1290 by the statute of &quot;Quia Emptores&quot; that prevents tenants from alienating their lands to others by subinfeudation, instead requiring all tenants wishing to alienate their land to do so by substitution.

Lord Denning, in &quot;Corpus Christi College Oxford v Gloucestershire County Council&quot; [1983] QB 360, described the manor thus:

==Tenancy==
In England in the Middle Ages, land was held on behalf of the English monarch or ruler by a powerful local supporter, who gave protection in return. The people who had sworn homage to the lord were known as vassals. Vassals were nobles who served loyalty for the king, in return for being given the use of land. After the Norman conquest of England, however, all land in England was owned by the monarch who then granted the use of it by means of a transaction known as enfeoffment, to earls, barons, and others, in return for military service. The person who held feudal land directly from the king was known as a &quot;tenant-in-chief&quot; (see also Land tenure).

==Sub-tenancy==
Military service was based upon units of ten knights (see knight-service). An important tenant-in-chief might be expected to provide all ten knights, and lesser tenants-in-chief, half of one. Some tenants-in-chief &quot;sub-infeuded&quot;, that is, granted, some land to a sub-tenant. Further sub-infeudation could occur down to the level of a lord of a single manor, which in itself might represent only a fraction of a knight&#x27;s fee. A mesne lord was the level of lord in the middle holding several manors, between the lords of a manor and the superior lord. The sub-tenant might have to provide knight-service, or finance just a portion of it, or pay something purely nominal. Any further sub-infeudation was prohibited by the Statute of in 1290. Knight-service was abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660.

==Manorial courts==

Manors were defined as an area of land and became closely associated to the advowson of the church; often by default the advowson was appended to the rights of the Manor, sometimes separated into moieties. Many lords of the manor were known as squires, at a time when land ownership was the basis of power. While some inhabitants were serfs who were bound to the land, others were freeholders, often known as franklins, who were free from customary services. Periodically all the tenants met at a &#x27;manorial court&#x27;, with the lord of the manor (or squire), or a steward, as chairman. These courts, known as courts baron, dealt with the tenants&#x27; rights and duties, changes of occupancy, and disputes between tenants. Some manorial courts also had the status of a court leet, and so they elected constables and other officials and were effectively magistrates&#x27; courts for minor offences.

==Later history==
The tenure of the freeholders was protected by the royal courts. After the Black Death, labour was in demand and so it became difficult for the lords of manors to impose duties on serfs. However their customary tenure continued and in the 16th century the royal courts also began to protect these customary tenants, who became known as copyholders. The name arises because the tenant was given a copy of the court&#x27;s record of the fact as a title deed.

During the 19th century, traditional manor courts were phased out. This was largely because by the mid 17th century, large English cities had leading residents such as John Harrison (died 1656) of Leeds, who saw the possession of the manor by only one resident as &quot;giving him too great a superiority over his fellow townsmen, and exposing him to considerable odium&quot;. Thus, the Manor of Leeds was divided between several people (shares). This situation could create legal problems. In January 1872, as a group, the &quot;lords of the manor of Leeds&quot; applied to the Law Courts to ascertain if they could &quot;exercise acts of ownership&quot; over land at a time when manorial rights were being sold to larger city corporations. In 1854, the lords of the manor of Leeds had &quot;sold&quot; these acts of ownership to the &quot;corporation of Leeds&quot; which would become the City of Leeds. Other town corporations bought their manorial titles in the 19th century, including Manchester, where the corporation paid £200,000 for the title in 1846.

By 1925, copyhold tenure had formally ended with the enactment of Law of Property Acts, Law of Property Act 1922 and Law of Property (Amendment) Act 1924, converting copyhold to fee simple. Although copyhold was abolished, the title of Lord of the Manor remains, and certain rights attached to it will also remain if they are registered under the Land Registration Act 2002. This Act ended manorial incidents unprotected by registration at the Land Registry after October 2013. The Land Registration Act 2002 does not affect the existence of unregistered lordships after October 2013, only the rights that would have previously been attached to the same.

During the latter part of the 20th century, many of these titles were sold to wealthy individuals seeking a distinction. However, certain purchasers, such as Mark Roberts, controversially exploited the right to claim unregistered land. A manorial title (i.e. &quot;Lord of the Manor&quot;) is not a title of nobility, as in a peerage title.

==Use of style==
The holder of a lordship of the manor can be referred to as Lord or Lady of the manor of [&quot;Placename&quot;], or Lord or Lady of [&quot;Placename&quot;], for example Lord or Lady of Little Bromwich; this shortening is permitted as long as &quot;of&quot; is not omitted and the name of the holder is included before as not to imply a peerage. It has been argued that lords of the manor can have the prefix &quot;The Much Honoured&quot; as using Mr, Miss or Mrs would be incorrect. The style &#x27;Lord of the Manor of X&#x27; or &#x27;Lord of X&#x27; is, in a sense, more of a description than a title, somewhat similar to the term laird in Scotland. King&#x27;s College, Cambridge has given the view that the term &quot;indicated wealth and privilege, and it carried rights and responsibilities&quot;.

It is debated whether manorial lordships can be classed as a noble title, historically holders of manorial titles were seen as people of rank. They are a semi-extinct form of hereditary landed title that grants the holder the rank of Esquire by prescription and are considered high gentry or lower, non-peeragenobility by contemporary heralds and students of nobiliary. Lordship in this sense is a synonym for ownership, although this ownership involved a historic legal jurisdiction in the form of the court baron. The journal &quot;Justice of the Peace &amp; Local Government Law&quot; advises that the position is unclear as to whether a lordship of a manor is a title of honour or a dignity, as this is yet to be tested by the courts. Technically, lords of manors are barons, or freemen; however, they do not use the term as a title. Unlike titled barons, they did not have a right to sit in the House of Lords, which was the case for all noble peers until the House of Lords Act 1999. John Selden in his esteemed work &quot;Titles of Honour&quot; (1672) writes, &quot;The word &quot;Baro&quot; (Latin for Baron) hath been also so much communicated, that not only all Lords of Manors have been from ancient time, and are at this day called sometimes Barons (as in the stile of their Court Barons, which is &quot;Curia Baronis, &amp;c&quot;. And I have read &quot;hors de son Barony&quot; in a barr to an Avowry for &quot;hors de son fee&quot;) But also the Judges of the Exchequer have it from antient time fixed on them.&quot;

==Manorial rights or incidents==
Since 1965 lords of the manor have been entitled to compensation in the event of compulsory purchase. Before the Land Registration Act 2002 it was possible for manors to be registered with HM Land Registry. No manorial rights could be created after 1925, following entry into force of the Law of Property Act 1922. Manorial incidents, which are the rights that a lord of the manor may exercise over other people&#x27;s land, lapsed on 12 October 2013 if not registered by then with the Land Registry. This is a separate issue to the registration of lordships of manors, since both registered and unregistered lordships will continue to exist after that date. It is only their practical rights that lost what is called &#x27;overriding interest&#x27;, or in other words the ability to affect land even if the interests or rights are not registered against that land, as of 12 October 2013. Manorial incidents can still be recorded for either registered or unregistered manors; however, proof of existence of the rights may need to be submitted to the Land Registry before they will be noted and they may not be registered at all after affected land is sold after 12 October 2013. This issue does not affect the existence of the title of lord of the manor. There have been cases where manors have been sold and the seller has unknowingly parted with rights to unregistered land in England and Wales.

==Present day==
A manorial lordship or ladyship is not connected to the English or British Peerage system, but rather is a remnant of the feudal or Baronial system that pre-dates it. It is debated as to whether the title forms part of the &quot;titled&quot; strata of the British nobility which is these days predominantly linked to titles of peerage, but the title has historically been associated with the English landed gentry and squirearchy within the context of the class structure of the United Kingdom. The status of lord of the manor is today often associated with the rank of esquire by prescription. Many Lordships of the Manor are &#x27;held&#x27; via grand serjeanty – a duty to carry out certain functions when required – which places them in close proximity to the monarch, often during the Coronation. An example would be the manor of Scrivelsby, where the owner of the manor is required to serve as King&#x27;s Champion. Additionally, many peers also hold lordships of the manor, and the sovereign via the Duchy of Lancaster is one of the largest holders of manorial titles in the UK. The Dukes of Westminster owe their fortune to the marriage of heiress Mary Davies, Lady of the Manor of Ebury, to Sir Thomas Grosvenor, 3rd Baronet, with the Manor of Ebury today forming the Grosvenor Estate. As a feudal title &#x27;Lord of the Manor&#x27;, unlike titles of peerage, can be inherited by whomever the title holder chooses (including females), and it is the only English title that can be sold (though they rarely are), as lordships of the manor are considered non-physical property in England and are fully enforceable in the English court system.

Feudal lordships of the manor therefore still exist today (2023) in English property law, being legal titles historically dating back to the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Being incorporated into property law (whether physical or non-physical) they can be bought and sold, as historic artifacts. The title itself as stated below can be separated from the physical property just as any other right can. Rights like the lordship, mineral and sporting can all be separate from the physical property. Since the 1290 statute of the title cannot be divided by subinfeudation. Land, sporting rights, and mineral rights can be separated. Property lawyers usually handle such transactions.

There are three elements to a manor (collectively called an &quot;honour&quot;):
# the &quot;lordship&quot; or &quot;dignity&quot; – the title granted by the manor,
# the &quot;manorial&quot; – the manor and its land,
# the &quot;seignory&quot; – the rights granted to the holder of the manor.

These three elements may exist separately or be combined. The first element, the title, may be held in moieties and may not be subdivided (this is prohibited by the statute of , preventing subinfeudation). The second and third elements in contrast can be subdivided. Although manorial lordship titles today no longer have rights attached to them, historically the lordship title itself had the power to collect fealty (i.e. services) and taxes.

The Historical Manuscripts Commission maintains two &quot;Manorial Document Registers&quot; that cover southern England. One register is arranged under parishes, the other is arranged under manors and shows the last-known whereabouts of the manorial records, the records are often very limited. The National Archives at Kew, London, and county record offices maintain many documents that mention manors or manorial rights. In some cases manorial court rolls have survived; such documents are now protected by law.

Ownership of a manorial lordship can be noted on request in British passports through an official observation worded, &#x27;The Holder is the Lord of the Manor of [name]&#x27;.

===Land claims===

The issues of land claims were raised in the UK Parliament in 2004 and were debated with a reply on the subject from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs acknowledging &quot;need for reform of the remnants of feudal and manorial law&quot; as a case was highlighted in Peterstone Wentloog, Wales, where villagers were being charged excessive fees to cross manorial land to access their homes.

In 2007, a caution against first registration caused houses to stop selling in Alstonefield after Mark Roberts, a businessman from Wales also previously involved in the Peterstone Wentloog case, registered a caution against first registration for after purchasing the lordship of the manor of Alstonefield for £10,000 in 1999. Judith Bray, land law expert from Buckingham University, speaking to BBC about the case, said that &quot;the legal situation is very confusing because a piece of legislation in the 1920s separated manorial rights from the ownership of land.&quot;

In reports about the Alstonefield case, the BBC stated, &quot;Scores of titles are bought and sold every year, some like the one Chris Eubank bought for fun, others seen as a business opportunity. It is entirely lawful, and there is no doubt the titles can be valuable. As well as rights to land like wastes and commons, they can also give the holder rights over land.&quot; The report goes on to say that the Law Commission in England and Wales were considering a project to abolish feudal land law but would not review manorial rights.

In many cases, a title of lord of the manor may not have any land or rights, and in such cases the title is known as an &#x27;incorporeal hereditament&#x27;. Before the Land Registration Act 2002 it was possible to volunteer to register lordship titles with the Land Registry; most did not seek to register. Dealings in previously registered manors are subject to compulsory registration; however, lords of manors may opt to de-register their titles and they will continue to exist unregistered. Manorial rights such as mineral rights ceased to be registerable after midnight on 12 October 2013.

===Mineral ownership===
There were fears in 2014 and earlier that holders of the manorial rights would allow fracking under the homes and near local communities of people living within the manorial estate after a disclosure that 73,000 applications to assert manorial mineral rights had been received by the Land Registry. Many of the applications received were from the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall asserting their historic &quot;manorial mineral ownership&quot;.

<text>Miss India, also known as Femina Miss India, is a national beauty pageant in India that selects representatives to compete in the Miss World competition, one of the Big Four international beauty pageants. It is organized by Femina, a women&#x27;s magazine published by The Times Group.

The current Femina Miss India World is Nikita Porwal from Madhya Pradesh. She was crowned by the previous titleholder, Nandini Gupta, on 16 October 2024 in Mumbai.

==History==

The first Miss India was Esther Abraham, from Calcutta, who won the title in 1947. The pageant was organized by the local press.

In 1952, two Miss India pageants were held. Indrani Rehman and Nutan were the winners. Nutan was crowned Miss Mussorie, while Rahman was crowned at Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai. Rahman later represented India at the first Miss Universe pageant in 1952.

In 1953, Peace Kanwal from Punjab was crowned Miss India at the Kardar-Kolynos pageant, organized by filmmaker Abdur Rashid Kardar. She later became a Bollywood actress.

In 1954, Leela Naidu from Maharashtra was crowned Miss India. That same year, she was featured in Vogue magazine&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s ten most beautiful women.

There was no Miss India pageant between 1955 and 1958. In 1959, Eve&#x27;s Weekly organized its first Miss India contest, with Fleur Ezekiel winning the title. She went on to represent India at Miss World 1959 in London.

The first Femina Miss India pageant was held in 1964. Meher Castelino Mistri of Maharashtra was crowned the winner and represented India at Miss Universe 1964 in the United States and Miss Nations 1964 in Spain.

Reita Faria became the first Miss India to win an international pageant, being crowned Miss World 1966 in London. She was the winner of the Eve&#x27;s Weekly Miss India contest. That same year, Yasmin Daji, the Femina Miss India winner, represented India at Miss Universe 1966 and placed third runner-up.

Zeenat Aman was the first Femina Miss India winner to claim an international title when she won Miss Asia Pacific 1970 in the Philippines. She later became a well-known Bollywood actress

In 1981, Meenakshi Seshadri became the youngest Miss India at age 17. She too later became a Bollywood actress.

In 1994, Sushmita Sen became the first Indian to win Miss Universe, while Aishwarya Rai, the first runner-up, went on to win Miss World the same year.

In 2000, all three winners from the Femina Miss India pageant—Lara Dutta, Priyanka Chopra and Dia Mirza—won Miss Universe, Miss World, and Miss Asia Pacific International, respectively.

In 2002, the third winner of the Femina Miss India contest began representing India at Miss Earth instead of Miss Asia Pacific.

In 2008, international choreographer Sandip Soparrkar joined as the official dance and grooming expert for the contestants, alongside experts like Dr. Sandesh Mayekar for smile design, Dr. Jamuna Pai for skin and hair care, and Sabira Merchant for etiquette.

In 2010, Tantra Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. (TEPL) partnered with Sushmita Sen to launch a new pageant, I Am She – Miss Universe India, acquiring the rights to send India&#x27;s representatives to Miss Universe. Winners of this pageant represented India at Miss Universe from 2010 to 2012. From 2010, Femina Miss India began crowning three winners: Femina Miss India World, Femina Miss India Earth, and Femina Miss India International, with the latter representing India at Miss International.

=== Competition irregularities ===
In 1989, Kalpana Pandit, who was initially declared the winner, was disqualified after it was found that she had misrepresented her nationality by holding a U.S. passport. Dolly Minhas was then crowned the winner.

In 2004, Lakshmi Pandit, Kalpana Pandit&#x27;s sister, was named the winner but later gave up the title due to her marriage. Sayali Bhagat was subsequently awarded the title.

In 2008, a controversy occurred when Gladrags President Maureen Wadia sent a legal notice to Harshita Saxena, the newly crowned Femina Miss India Earth 2008, for violating an exclusive two-year contract she had signed in 2006. The contract required Saxena to seek written permission from Gladrags before participating in other beauty contests. As a result, Saxena surrendered her title, and Tanvi Vyas was crowned Miss India Earth. Vyas went on to represent India at Miss Earth 2008. Saxena later placed fourth in the Femina Miss India 2009 competition and represented India at Miss International 2009.

== India in international pageants ==


Miss India has been sending representatives to the Miss Universe pageant since 1952, starting with Indrani Rehman, and to the Miss World pageant since 1959, with Fleur Ezekiel.

In 1970, Zeenat Aman became the first Indian and South Asian woman to win the Miss Asia Pacific title.

In 1991, Femina Miss India gained the rights to send Indian contestants to the Miss International pageant.

In 1994, Sushmita Sen won Miss Universe, becoming the first Indian woman to hold the title. That same year, Aishwarya Rai, the runner-up at Miss India, won Miss World. Both Sen and Rai later pursued successful careers in Bollywood.

Their success led to the rise of grooming institutions that prepared young women for pageants, significantly increasing participation. Diana Hayden, Miss India World 1997, won Miss World that same year. In 1999, Yukta Mookhey, Miss India World, also won Miss World.

In 2000, all three Miss India winners: Lara Dutta (Miss Universe), Priyanka Chopra (Miss World), and Diya Mirza (Miss Asia Pacific) won their respective international titles. Australia is the only other country to have achieved this in 1972.

In 2002, the third title in Femina Miss India was renamed Femina Miss India-Earth to send representatives to the newly launched Miss Earth pageant, focused on environmental advocacy. A finalist was then sent to Miss International.

From 2007 to 2009, three equal titleholders represented India at Miss Universe, Miss World, and Miss Earth. In 2010, the rights to send contestants to Miss Universe were transferred to a new pageant, I Am She - Miss Universe India. By 2013, The Times Group reacquired the Miss Universe rights and launched the Miss Diva pageant.

In 2010, the third title at Femina Miss India was renamed Femina Miss India-International, with winners representing India at Miss International. That same year, Nicole Faria became the first Indian to win the Miss Earth title in Vietnam, leaving Miss International as the only major global pageant India has yet to win.

In 2012, Himangini Singh Yadu became the first Indian and Asian to win the Miss Asia Pacific World title, sent by the I Am She - Miss Universe India pageant. In 2013, Srishti Rana won the same title, marking a rare back-to-back victory for India and becoming the first Miss Diva winner to claim the Miss Asia Pacific World crown.

In 2014, Asha Bhat won Miss Supranational, becoming the first Indian woman to win the title and the second Asian overall. That same year, Ruhi Singh, the first Femina Miss India Universal Peace and Humanity, won the Miss Universal Peace and Humanity pageant in Lebanon.

India also achieved a rare triple victory at the Miss Asia Pacific World pageant, with Swetha Raj winning in 2014 after the previous winner was dethroned. She was sent by the Miss India Australia organization.

==International winners==
Reita Faria from India won Miss World in 1966, becoming the first Asian woman to achieve this honor and marking India&#x27;s first major international pageant victory. In 1994, Sushmita Sen became the first Indian to win Miss Universe. That same year, Aishwarya Rai was crowned Miss World, making India the last country in the 20th century to win both Miss Universe and Miss World in the same year.

Diana Hayden won Miss World in 1997, followed by Yukta Mookhey in 1999. In 2000, Lara Dutta and Priyanka Chopra repeated India&#x27;s earlier success, with Dutta winning Miss Universe and Chopra winning Miss World. This remains the most recent time (as of 2024) that a country has won both titles in the same year and the only time it has happened in the 21st century.

In 2010, Nicole Faria from Bangalore became the first Indian woman to win Miss Earth. Manushi Chhillar won Miss World 2017, and in 2021, Harnaaz Sandhu became the third Indian woman to win Miss Universe, the latest Big Four titleholder from India as of 2024.

== Miss Diva ==

Established in 2013, Miss Diva is a separate pageant organization from Femina Miss India, though both are owned by the Times Group. Its primary objective is to select India&#x27;s representative for the Miss Universe competition through an annual national pageant.

In addition to Miss Universe, Miss Diva also sent delegates to Miss International (in 2013), Miss Supranational (since 2013), Miss Asia Pacific World (in 2013), and Miss Earth (in 2014).

However, in 2024, the Miss Diva organization withdrew its license to participate in Miss Universe. They have hinted at a possible return in the future. Currently, Miss Diva sends representatives only to the Miss Supranational pageant. The most recent delegate they sent competed in the 2024 edition.

==Representatives to the Big Four pageants==
The following women have represented India in the Big Four international beauty pageants, the four major international beauty pageants for women. These are Miss World, Miss Universe, Miss International, Miss Earth.

* : For Miss World 1976, India withdrew in protest against the presence of two South African entries - one white and one black - in conformity with the apartheid policy of racial separation.
* : For Miss World 1977, India withdrew in protest against Apartheid. Black women were not allowed to compete in Miss South Africa (there were two competitions one for whites, that winner was sent to the international one; and another for blacks).

<text>A try square or try-square is a woodworking tool used for marking and checking 90° angles on pieces of wood. Though woodworkers use many different types of square, the try square is considered one of the essential tools for woodworking.

The &quot;square&quot; in the name refers to the 90° angle. To &quot;try&quot; a piece of wood is to check if the edges and faces are straight, flat, and square to one another. A &quot;try square&quot; is so called because it is used to &quot;try&quot; how &quot;square&quot; the workpiece is.

== Description ==
A try square is made of two key parts, the &quot;blade&quot; (also known as a &quot;beam&quot; or &quot;tongue&quot;) and the &quot;stock&quot;, which are fixed together at 90° to form an &#x27;L&#x27; shape.

The blade is usually made of wood or steel and is fixed into the stock, which is usually thicker than the blade and made of wood, metal or plastic. Both the stock and the tongue are usually made with parallel edges. Typically the blade and the stock will be rectangular in profile, though on some wooden squares the ends of the blade and the stock might be cut to a decorative shape. Some steel blades also have ruler markings for making measurements.

Often the top of the stock will not cover the full width of the blade so the stock does not get in the way when making a mark. This gap also allows space should an inaccurate blade need to be planed, filed or sanded.

Try squares are typically long. squares are handier for small tasks that don&#x27;t require a longer square, such as marking small joints. A typical general purpose square is . Larger squares are used for tasks such as cabinetry, and are more likely to be made by the woodworker themselves, but other methods are often preferred for such larger tasks.

A common form of try square has a broad blade made of steel that is riveted into a stable, dense tropical hardwood stock, often ebony or rosewood. The inside of the wooden stock usually has a brass strip fixed to it to reduce wear.

On some squares the top of the stock is angled at 45°, so the square can be used as a mitre square for marking and checking 45° angles.

A similar type of square is the engineer&#x27;s square, used in metalworking and by some woodworkers. The blade is made with both a steel blade and a steel stock and is usually manufactured to a higher degree of accuracy.

== Use ==
The stock is usually held against the edge of the workpiece and either side of the tongue is then used as a straight edge for making a mark, or as a reference to check the accuracy of an angle.

When checking if an angle is square, the woodworker will test the workpiece in multiple places or will run the square along the length of the workpiece. The woodworker might hold the workpiece up towards a light to help see any gaps between the workpiece and the square. Another method is to try sliding feeler gauges between the square and the workpiece.

For making a mark a woodworker might use a pencil, a pen or, for greater accuracy, a marking knife or blade.

== History and symbolism ==
Wooden try squares have survived from Ancient Egypt and Ancient Rome and can be seen in art from the time. From the 18th century squares began to be manufactured in factories, prior to that they were typically made from wood and made by the tradesmen themselves. Some woodworkers continue to make their own try squares.

The square is incorporated into the most common Freemasonry symbol, the Square and Compasses. Historically squares have also been used by woodworkers, such as joiners and carpenters, as symbols in signs and heraldry to represent their trade. The square as a symbol is also seen in artistic representations of the Christian saints Thomas the Apostle and James the Less.

== Accuracy ==

A square can become less accurate over time through both common use and abuse, such as the edges becoming worn over time or the square being dropped or mistreated. Wooden squares can also vary with changes in temperature and humidity. For this reason more dimensionally stable woods, such as mahogany, are preferred.

There are a number of methods for correcting an inaccurate square by hand. Wooden blades can be corrected using a hand plane and sandpaper, while metal blades can be corrected using a file, emery cloth, or sandpaper.

<text>Slim Goodbody (&quot;the Superhero of Health&quot;, also known as Mr. Goodbody) is a recurring character created and performed by John Burstein. Burstein created the character in 1975. He performs wearing a sometimes white, sometimes peach colored unitard with various tissues, organs and organ systems painted in biologically-accurate locations and sizes. Each costume costs $4,000.

== John Burstein ==

Burstein was born on December 25, 1949, in Mineola, New York, and grew up in Lawrence, Nassau County, New York. While working at The Floating Hospital in New York City he began writing songs and skits to entertain the children there and to teach them about anatomy and the workings of the human body. He eventually added an organ-painted body suit to the design, dubbing his alter-ego &quot;Slim Goodbody&quot;.

Burstein lives with his wife, Chrissy, in a lakeside home in Lincolnville, Maine. They have two sons, Devin and Luke.

Burstein&#x27;s sister, Karen Burstein, is a former New York state senator and judge.

==Career==
Burstein soon took his character outside the hospital. In his earliest days, he mainly did personal appearances and guest spots on shows such as &quot;The Today Show&quot; and &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. His skits also focused on exercise, personal hygiene, and nutrition. Between 1976 and 1981, he appeared twice a week on the CBS series &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;.

Slim Goodbody eventually received his own television series in 1980, &quot;Inside Story&quot; on PBS. The program mainly consisted of Burstein&#x27;s live-show Slim Goodbody sketches, though other children&#x27;s show celebrities such as Captain Kangaroo would sometimes make guest appearances. The show soon became the station&#x27;s second-highest rated program, and Burstein landed roles on other stations, including Nickelodeon. Since then, Slim Goodbody has featured in several other series, as well. At one point, Slim Goodbody began making educational shorts on such subjects as the fear of visiting a hospital, amongst others. One of these shorts featured Burstein&#x27;s son, Devin, as a child learning about hospitals as he overcomes his fears of an upcoming operation.

Beginning in 1982, the character has also appeared in books published by McGraw-Hill, Putnam, and Fairview Press. A series of educational shorts featuring Burstein&#x27;s character were produced in 1985. Titled, &quot;Well, Well, Well! with Slim Goodbody&quot;, these were aimed for school children grades K-4.

In 2014, Slim Goodbody appeared in a Radio Shack commercial advertisement during the Super Bowl XLVIII.

Over the years, Slim Goodbody has also addressed child obesity, bullying, personal safety, self-esteem, literacy and environmentalism.

Today, Burstein tours the United States and Canada dressed as Slim Goodbody and performing in &quot;Bodyology&quot;. School-based shows, performed by other actors, include &quot;Musical Health Show&quot; and &quot;Lighten Up!&quot;

Burstein and his Goodbody programs have won numerous awards including the Parents&#x27; Choice Award and the Healthy American Fitness Leader Award.

<text>John David McAfee ( ; 18 September 1945 – 23 June 2021) was a British and American computer programmer, businessman, and two-time presidential candidate who unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination for president of the United States in 2016 and in 2020. In 1987, he wrote the first commercial anti-virus software, founding McAfee Associates to sell his creation. He resigned in 1994 and sold his remaining stake in the company. McAfee became the company&#x27;s most vocal critic in later years, urging consumers to uninstall the company&#x27;s anti-virus software, which he characterized as bloatware. He disavowed the company&#x27;s continued use of his name in branding, a practice that has persisted in spite of a short-lived corporate rebrand attempt under Intel ownership.

McAfee&#x27;s fortunes plummeted in the financial crisis of 2007–2008. After leaving McAfee Associates, he founded the companies Tribal Voice (makers of the PowWow chat program), QuorumEx, and Future Tense Central, among others, and was involved in leadership positions in the companies Everykey, MGT Capital Investments, and Luxcore, among others. His personal and business interests included smartphone apps, cryptocurrency, yoga, light-sport aircraft and recreational drug use. He resided for a number of years in Belize, but returned to the United States in 2013 while wanted in Belize for questioning on suspicion of murder.

McAfee was a vocal advocate for privacy and personal freedom, central to his libertarian campaigns in 2016 and 2020. He opposed government surveillance and supported cryptocurrency as a way to reduce state control over financial systems. He framed his legal issues, including tax evasion charges, as resistance to unjust government overreach.

In October 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain over U.S. tax evasion charges. U.S. federal prosecutors brought criminal and civil charges alleging that McAfee had failed to file income taxes over a four-year period. On 23 June 2021, he was found dead due to an apparent suicide by hanging in his prison cell near Barcelona shortly after the Spanish National Court authorized his extradition to the U.S. His death generated speculation and theories about the possibility that he was murdered. McAfee&#x27;s wife, Janice McAfee, said she did not believe McAfee died by suicide.

==Early life==
McAfee was born in Cinderford, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England, on 18 September 1945, on a U.S. Army base (of the 596th Ordnance Ammunition Company), to an American father, Don McAfee, who was stationed there, and a British mother, Joan Williams. His father was from Roanoke, Virginia. In spite of primarily being raised in Salem, Virginia, McAfee said he felt as much British as American. When he was 15, his father, whom a BBC columnist described as &quot;an abusive alcoholic&quot;, killed himself with a gun. He had spent his childhood living in fear that a beating from his father could happen at any time and struggled to make sense of why this was happening to him. In &quot;Running With the Devil: The Wild World of John McAfee&quot;, it is alleged that McAfee may have shot and killed his father, staging the scene to look like a suicide.

McAfee received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics in 1967 from Roanoke College in Virginia, which subsequently awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 2008. After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree, McAfee began working towards a doctorate in mathematics at Northeast Louisiana State College, but was expelled in about 1968 because of a relationship with an undergraduate student, who became his first wife.

== Ventures ==

===NASA, Univac, Xerox, CSC, Booz Allen and Lockheed===

McAfee was employed as a programmer by NASA from 1968 to 1970. From there, he went to Univac as a software designer, and later to Xerox as an operating system architect. In 1978, he joined Computer Sciences Corporation as a software consultant. He worked for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton from 1980 to 1982. In 1986, while employed by Lockheed, he read about the Brain computer virus made for the PC, and he found it terrifying. Sensing a business opportunity, he went about creating an antivirus software that could detect the computer virus and remove it automatically. In 1987, McAfee created McAfee Associates Inc. to sell this software, which he named VirusScan. This was the first anti-virus software brought to market, and one of the first software products to be distributed over the Internet.

=== McAfee Associates ===
Initially McAfee did not seek a large userbase of paying users, but rather wanted to raise awareness of the need to be protected from computer viruses. However, by making people fear such malware, he managed to generate millions of sales, and by 1990 he was making $5 million a year. The company was incorporated in Delaware in 1992, and had its initial public offering the same year. In August 1993, McAfee stepped down as chief executive and remained with the company as the chief technical officer. He was succeeded by Bill Larson. In 1994 he sold his remaining stake in the company. He had no further involvement in its operations.

After various mergers and ownership changes, Intel acquired McAfee in August 2010. In January 2014, Intel announced that McAfee-related products would be marketed as Intel Security. McAfee expressed his pleasure at the name change, saying, &quot;I am now everlastingly grateful to Intel for freeing me from this terrible association with the worst software on the planet.&quot; The business was soon de-merged from Intel, once more under the McAfee name.

=== PowWow, QuoromEx, MGT and more ===
McAfee founded the company Tribal Voice in 1994, which developed one of the first instant messaging programs, PowWow.

In 2000, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Zone Labs, makers of firewall software, prior to its acquisition by Check Point Software in 2003. In the 2000s McAfee invested in and advertised ultra-light flights, which he marketed as &quot;aerotrekking&quot;.

In 2000 he bought a large property in Colorado and opened a yoga and meditation retreat there. In the following year he authored four books on yoga and meditation.

In August 2009 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that McAfee&#x27;s personal fortune had declined to $4 million from a peak of $100 million due to the effect of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 on his investments.

McAfee relocated to Belize in 2009, buying a beachfront property on the island of Ambergris Caye and later also some property near the mainland village of Carmelita, where he surrounded himself with a large group of armed security guards.

In 2009, McAfee was interviewed in Belize for the CNBC special &quot;The Bubble Decade&quot;, in which it was reported that he had invested in and/or built many mansions in the USA that went unsold when the 2007 global recession hit. The report also discussed his quest to raise plants for possible medicinal uses on his land in Belize.

In February 2010, McAfee and biologist Allison Adonizio started the company QuorumEx, headquartered in Belize, which aimed to produce herbal antibiotics that disrupt quorum sensing in bacteria.

In June 2013, McAfee uploaded a parody video titled &quot;How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus&quot; onto his YouTube channel. In it, he critiques the antivirus software while snorting white powder and being stripped by scantily clad women. It received ten million views. He told Reuters the video was meant to ridicule the media&#x27;s negative coverage of him. A spokesman for McAfee Inc. called the video&#x27;s statements &quot;ludicrous&quot;.

Also in 2013, McAfee founded Future Tense Central, which aimed to produce a secure computer network device called the D-Central. By 2016, it was also an incubator.

In February 2014, McAfee announced Cognizant, an application for smartphones which displays information about the permissions of other installed applications. In April 2014, it was renamed DCentral 1, and an Android version was released for free on Google Play.

At the DEF CON conference in Las Vegas in August 2014, McAfee warned people not to use smartphones, suggesting apps are used to spy on clueless consumers who do not read privacy user agreements. In January 2016, he became the chief evangelist for security startup Everykey.

In February 2016, McAfee publicly volunteered to decrypt the iPhone used by Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik in San Bernardino, avoiding the need for Apple to build a backdoor. He later admitted that his claims regarding the ease of cracking the phone were a publicity stunt, while still asserting its possibility.

In May 2016, McAfee was appointed chairman and CEO of MGT Capital Investments, a technology holding company. It initially said it would rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies, although this plan was abandoned due to a dispute with Intel over rights to the &quot;McAfee&quot; name. He changed MGT&#x27;s focus from social gaming to cybersecurity, saying &quot;anti-virus software is dead, it no longer works&quot;, and that &quot;the new paradigm has to stop the hacker getting in&quot; before they can do damage. The first product for this purpose was Sentinel.

Soon after joining MGT, McAfee said he and his team had exploited a flaw in the Android operating system that allowed him to read encrypted messages from WhatsApp. Gizmodo investigated his claim, and reported that he had sent reporters malware-infected phones to make this hack work. He replied: &quot;Of course the phones had malware on them. How that malware got there is the story, which we will release after speaking with Google. It involves a serious flaw in the Android architecture.&quot;

McAfee moved MGT into the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, both to make money for the company, and to increase MGT&#x27;s expertise in dealing with blockchains, which he thought was important for cybersecurity.

In August 2017, McAfee stepped down as CEO, instead serving as MGT&#x27;s &quot;chief cybersecurity visionary.&quot; In January 2018, he left the company altogether. Both sides said the split was amicable; he said he wanted to spend all of his time on cryptocurrencies, while the company told of pressure from potential investors to disassociate itself from him.

On 13 August 2018, McAfee took a position of CEO with Luxcore, a cryptocurrency company focused on enterprise solutions.

==Politics==
===Positions===
McAfee was a libertarian, advocating the decriminalization of cannabis, an end to the war on drugs, non-interventionism in foreign policy, a free market economy which does not redistribute wealth, and upholding free trade. He supported abolishing the Transportation Security Administration.

McAfee advocated increased cyber awareness and more action against the threat of cyberwarfare. He pushed religious liberty, saying that business owners should be able to deny service in circumstances that contradict their religious beliefs, adding: &quot;No one is forcing you to buy anything or to choose one person over another. So why should I be forced to do anything if I am not harming you? It&#x27;s my choice to sell, your choice to buy.&quot;

McAfee contended that taxes were illegal, and claimed in 2019 that he had not filed a tax return since 2010. He referred to himself as &quot;a prime target&quot; of the Internal Revenue Service.

In July 2017, McAfee predicted on Twitter that the price of a bitcoin would jump to $500,000 within three years, adding: &quot;If not, I will eat my own dick on national television.&quot; In July 2019, he predicted a price of $1 million by the end of 2020. In January 2020, he tweeted that his predictions were &quot;a ruse to onboard new users,&quot; and that bitcoin had limited potential because it is &quot;an ancient technology.&quot;

===2016 presidential campaign===
On 8 September 2015, McAfee announced a bid for president of the United States in the 2016 presidential election, as the candidate of a newly formed political party called the Cyber Party. On 24 December 2015, he re-announced his candidacy bid saying that he would instead seek the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party. On the campaign trail, he consistently polled alongside the party&#x27;s other top candidates, Gary Johnson and Austin Petersen. The three partook in the Libertarian Party&#x27;s first nationally televised presidential debate on 29 March 2016. His running mate was photographer, commercial real estate broker and Libertarian activist Judd Weiss.

McAfee came in second in the primaries and third at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention.

====Notable endorsements====
* Adam Kokesh, talk show host and activist
* John Moore, Nevada assemblyman
* L. Neil Smith, science fiction author and activist

===2020 presidential campaign===

Contrary to his assertion at the 2016 convention, McAfee tweeted on 3 June 2018 that he would run for president again in 2020, either with the Libertarian Party or a separate party that he would create. He later chose to run as a Libertarian. He mainly campaigned for wider cryptocurrency use.

On 22 January 2019, McAfee tweeted that he would continue his campaign &quot;in exile,&quot; following reports that he, his wife, and four campaign staff were indicted for tax-related felonies by the IRS. He said he was in &quot;international waters,&quot; and had previously tweeted that he was going to Venezuela. The IRS has not commented on the alleged indictments. He defended Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara on Twitter, putting himself at odds with Libertarian National Committee chairman Nicholas Sarwark, who wrote, &quot;I hear very little buzz about McAfee this time around ... making a defense of Che Guevara from Cuba may ingratiate him with the Cuban government, but it didn&#x27;t resonate well with Libertarians.&quot;

In a tweet on 4 March 2020, McAfee simultaneously suspended his 2020 presidential campaign, endorsed Vermin Supreme, and announced his campaign for the Libertarian Party vice presidential nomination. The next day, he returned to the presidential field, reversing the suspension of his bid, as &quot;No one in the Libertarian Party Would consider me For Vice President.&quot; The next month, he endorsed Adam Kokesh and became Kokesh&#x27;s vice-presidential candidate, while still seeking the presidency for himself. At the 2020 Libertarian National Convention, McAfee failed to qualify for the vice-presidential nomination.

==Legal issues==
McAfee was named a defendant in a 2008 civil court case related to his Aerotrekking light-sport aircraft venture and the death of nephew Joel Bitow and a passenger.

On 30 April 2012, McAfee&#x27;s property in Orange Walk Town, Belize, was raided by the Gang Suppression Unit of the Belize Police Department. A GSU press release said he was arrested for unlicensed drug manufacturing and possession of an unlicensed weapon. He was released without charge. In December 2012, McAfee told a &quot;Wired&quot; reporter that from 2010 to 2011 he had made several posts to the drug discussion forum Bluelight discussing his use and manufacturing of the stimulant drug MDPV under the alias &#x27;Stuffmonger&#x27;. As of March 2024, the Stuffmonger account had made 220 posts on the site in 2010 and early 2011.

In 2012, Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez confirmed that McAfee was neither convicted nor charged, only suspected.

In January 2014, while in Canada, he said that when the Belizean government raided his property, it seized his assets, and that his house later burned down under suspicious circumstances.

On 2 August 2015, McAfee was arrested in Henderson County, Tennessee, on one count of driving under the influence and one count of possession of a firearm while intoxicated.

In July 2019, McAfee and members of his entourage were arrested while his yacht was docked at Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, on suspicion of carrying high-caliber weapons and ammunition. They were held for four days and released. Weapons were seized, according to the Public Ministry.

On 11 August 2020, McAfee falsely stated that he was arrested in Norway during the COVID-19 pandemic after refusing to replace a lace thong with a more effective face mask. He later tweeted a picture of himself with a bruised eye, claiming it occurred during this arrest. A photo of the alleged arrest shows an officer with the German word for &quot;police&quot; on his uniform, ostensibly invalidating McAfee&#x27;s claim of having been arrested in Norway. The Augsburg police later said he tried to enter Germany on that day, but was not arrested.

=== Death of Gregory Faull ===
On 12 November 2012, Belize police began to search for McAfee as a person of interest in connection to the homicide investigation of American immigrant Gregory Viant Faull, who was found dead of a gunshot wound the day before, at his home on the island of Ambergris Caye, the largest island in Belize. Faull was a neighbor of McAfee&#x27;s. In a contemporary interview with &quot;Wired&quot;, McAfee said he had been afraid police would kill him and refused their routine questions and evaded them. He buried himself in sand for several hours with a cardboard box over his head. Belize&#x27;s prime minister, Dean Barrow, called him &quot;extremely paranoid, even bonkers&quot;. He fled Belize rather than cooperate.

In December 2012, the magazine &quot;Vice&quot; accidentally gave away McAfee&#x27;s location at a Guatemalan resort, when a photo taken by one of its journalists accompanying him was posted with the EXIF geolocation metadata still attached.

While in Guatemala, McAfee asked Chad Essley, an American cartoonist and animator, to set up a blog so he could write about his experience while on the run. He then appeared publicly in Guatemala City, where he unsuccessfully sought political asylum.

On 5 December 2012, he was arrested for illegally entering Guatemala. Shortly afterward, the board reviewing his asylum plea denied it and he was taken to a detention center to await deportation to Belize.

On 6 December 2012, Reuters and ABC News reported that McAfee had two minor heart attacks in the detention center and was hospitalized. His lawyer said he had no heart attacks, rather high blood pressure and anxiety attacks. McAfee later said he faked the heart attacks to buy time for his attorney to file a series of appeals that ultimately prevented his deportation to Belize, thus hastening that government&#x27;s decision to send him back to the United States.

On 12 December 2012, McAfee was released and deported to the United States.

On 14 November 2018, the Circuit Court in Orlando, Florida, refused to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit against him for Faull&#x27;s death. McAfee did not appear in court, lost the case by default and was ordered to pay $25 million to Faull&#x27;s estate.

=== U.S. tax evasion charges and planned extradition ===
In January 2019, McAfee announced that he was on the run from U.S. authorities, and living internationally on a boat following the convening of a grand jury to indict him, his wife, and four of his 2020 Libertarian Party presidential primaries staff on tax evasion charges. At the time, the Internal Revenue Service had not independently confirmed the existence of any such indictment.

On 5 October 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain at the request of the United States Department of Justice for tax evasion. The June indictment, which was unsealed upon his arrest, alleged he earned millions of dollars from 2014 to 2018, and failed to file income tax returns.

On 6 October, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint further alleging McAfee and his bodyguard promoted certain initial coin offerings (ICOs) in a fraudulent cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme. It claims he presented himself as an impartial investor when he promoted the ICOs, despite allegedly getting paid $23 million in digital assets in return.

On 5 March 2021, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for the
Southern District of New York formally indicted him and an executive adviser on these charges.

McAfee was jailed in Spain, pending extradition to the United States.

On 23 June 2021, the Spanish National Court authorized his extradition to face charges in Tennessee; McAfee is suspected of having committed suicide several hours after the authorization, though the official ruling has come under suspicion by the public, as McAfee made clear he had no intention of committing suicide by his tweet from 2019. The tweet, posted in November 2019, said: &quot;Getting subtle messages from U.S. officials saying, in effect: &#x27;We&#x27;re coming for you McAfee! We&#x27;re going to kill yourself&#x27;. I got a tattoo today just in case. If I suicide myself, I didn&#x27;t. I was whackd. Check my right arm.&quot; It included a photo of a tattoo that said &quot;$WHACKD.&quot; The New York extradition case was still pending in a lower Spanish court.

==Personal life==
McAfee married three times. He met his first wife, Fran, circa 1968 while he was working towards a doctorate at Northeast Louisiana State College and she was an 18-year-old undergraduate student. Their affair led to his expulsion from the college. He married his second wife, Judy, a former flight attendant at American Airlines, circa 1987; they divorced in 2002.

The night after McAfee arrived in the United States after being deported from Guatemala in December 2012, he was solicited by and slept with Janice Dyson, then a prostitute 30 years his junior in South Beach, Miami Beach, Florida. They began a relationship and married in 2013. She claims that he saved her from human traffickers. The couple moved to Portland, Oregon in 2013.

In a 2012 article in &quot;Mensa Bulletin&quot;, the magazine of the American Mensa, McAfee said developing the first commercial antivirus program had made him &quot;the most popular hacking target&quot; and &quot;[h]ackers see hacking me as a badge of honor.&quot; For his own cybersecurity, he said he had other people buy his computer equipment for him, used pseudonyms for setting up computers and logins, and changed his IP address several times a day. When asked on another occasion if he personally used McAfee&#x27;s antivirus software, he replied: &quot;I take it off [...] it&#x27;s too annoying.&quot;

According to a 2016 article, McAfee had been using the then legal drug alpha-PHP which he imported from China and which may have caused his paranoia. McAfee reportedly previously used the stimulant drug MDPV beginning in 2010, and was a member of the online drug discussion forum Bluelight.

In 2015, he resided in Lexington, Tennessee.

In December 2018, he tweeted that he had &quot;47 genetic children.&quot; His third wife described him in a Father&#x27;s Day message as &quot;father of many, loved by few.&quot;

==Death==
On 23 June 2021, McAfee was found dead in his prison cell, hours after the Spanish National Court ordered his extradition to the United States on criminal charges filed in Tennessee by the United States Department of Justice Tax Division. The Catalan Justice Department said &quot;everything indicates&quot; he killed himself by hanging. An official autopsy confirmed his suicide. A Spanish court also ruled McAfee died by suicide.

McAfee&#x27;s death ignited speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered. Such speculation was particularly fueled by a 2019 post McAfee made on Twitter that read, in part, &quot;If I suicide myself, I didn&#x27;t. I was whackd .&quot; McAfee&#x27;s death drew comparisons to the circumstances of the death of American financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Several times, McAfee claimed if he were ever found dead by hanging, it would mean he was murdered. The day after his death, his lawyer told reporters that while he regularly maintained contact with McAfee in prison, there were no signs of suicidal intent. McAfee&#x27;s widow reaffirmed this position in her first public remarks since her husband&#x27;s death, and also called for a &quot;thorough&quot; investigation.

On 14 December 2023, the morgue delivered McAfee&#x27;s body to his family to be taken to the United States for his funeral. Until then, it had been kept in a refrigerator at the Justice City of Barcelona.

In November 2023 interview with Cointelgraph McAfee&#x27;s widow Janice McAfee claimed that he died without a will or estate which left her without any money and that she was working odd jobs to make ends meet.

In January 2025 McAfee&#x27;s X (formerly Twitter) account became active announcing the launch of a new meme coin cryptocurrency and chatbot titled Antivirus. A day later McAfee&#x27;s widow Janice McAfee who had access to the account, denied that his account was hacked claimed that meme coin and created to &quot;honor John’s legacy and his memory&quot; which generated a number of critical responses over it being a potential scam. As of January 2025 the meme coin has a market cap of $37 million, though the Antivirus X account was later suspended.

==In the media==
&quot;&quot; is a Showtime Networks documentary about the portion of McAfee&#x27;s life spent in Belize. It began airing in September 2016. It covers allegations of him drugging and sexually assaulting his business partner from QuorumEx, Allison Adonizio, and ordering the murders of Belizean David Middleton and American expat Gregory Faull. In an interview with Bloomberg&#x27;s Pimm Fox and Kathleen Hayes on 8 September 2016, McAfee said these incidents were fabricated, and &quot;Belize is a third-world banana republic and you can go down there and make any story you want if you pay your interviewees, which Showtime did.&quot;

Glenn Ficarra and John Requa stated in 2017 they would direct a film about McAfee titled &quot;King of the Jungle&quot;, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. At various points, Johnny Depp, Michael Keaton, and Seth Rogen were reported to have taken roles and later to have left the project. Zac Efron was reported to star as journalist Ari Furman.

McAfee and his wife were interviewed on ABC News&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; regarding Faull&#x27;s murder.

The 2022 documentary film &quot;Running With the Devil: The Wild World of John McAfee&quot; includes footage from an unreleased documentary by &quot;Vice&quot;, and interviews by Rocco Castoro, Alex Cody Foster, and Robert King.

The character of Mr. Boss in the Adult Swim animated series &quot;Smiling Friends&quot; was based on McAfee.

<doc id="602401" wikidata="Q1192553" url="?curid=602401" title="Facial recognition system">
<text>A facial recognition system is a technology potentially capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces. Such a system is typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, and works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.

Development began on similar systems in the 1960s, beginning as a form of computer application. Since their inception, facial recognition systems have seen wider uses in recent times on smartphones and in other forms of technology, such as robotics. Because computerized facial recognition involves the measurement of a human&#x27;s physiological characteristics, facial recognition systems are categorized as biometrics. Although the accuracy of facial recognition systems as a biometric technology is lower than iris recognition, fingerprint image acquisition, palm recognition or voice recognition, it is widely adopted due to its contactless process. Facial recognition systems have been deployed in advanced human–computer interaction, video surveillance, law enforcement, passenger screening, decisions on employment and housing and automatic indexing of images.

Facial recognition systems are employed throughout the world today by governments and private companies. Their effectiveness varies, and some systems have previously been scrapped because of their ineffectiveness. The use of facial recognition systems has also raised controversy, with claims that the systems violate citizens&#x27; privacy, commonly make incorrect identifications, encourage gender norms and racial profiling, and do not protect important biometric data. The appearance of synthetic media such as deepfakes has also raised concerns about its security. These claims have led to the ban of facial recognition systems in several cities in the United States. Growing societal concerns led social networking company Meta Platforms to shut down its Facebook facial recognition system in 2021, deleting the face scan data of more than one billion users. The change represented one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology&#x27;s history. IBM also stopped offering facial recognition technology due to similar concerns.

== History of facial recognition technology ==
Automated facial recognition was pioneered in the 1960s by Woody Bledsoe, Helen Chan Wolf, and Charles Bisson, whose work focused on teaching computers to recognize human faces. Their early facial recognition project was dubbed &quot;man-machine&quot; because a human first needed to establish the coordinates of facial features in a photograph before they could be used by a computer for recognition. Using a graphics tablet, a human would pinpoint facial features coordinates, such as the pupil centers, the inside and outside corners of eyes, and the widows peak in the hairline. The coordinates were used to calculate 20 individual distances, including the width of the mouth and of the eyes. A human could process about 40 pictures an hour, building a database of these computed distances. A computer would then automatically compare the distances for each photograph, calculate the difference between the distances, and return the closed records as a possible match.

In 1970, Takeo Kanade publicly demonstrated a face-matching system that located anatomical features such as the chin and calculated the distance ratio between facial features without human intervention. Later tests revealed that the system could not always reliably identify facial features. Nonetheless, interest in the subject grew and in 1977 Kanade published the first detailed book on facial recognition technology.

In 1993, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) and the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) established the face recognition technology program FERET to develop &quot;automatic face recognition capabilities&quot; that could be employed in a productive real life environment &quot;to assist security, intelligence, and law enforcement personnel in the performance of their duties.&quot; Face recognition systems that had been trialled in research labs were evaluated. The FERET tests found that while the performance of existing automated facial recognition systems varied, a handful of existing methods could viably be used to recognize faces in still images taken in a controlled environment. The FERET tests spawned three US companies that sold automated facial recognition systems. Vision Corporation and Miros Inc were founded in 1994, by researchers who used the results of the FERET tests as a selling point. Viisage Technology was established by a identification card defense contractor in 1996 to commercially exploit the rights to the facial recognition algorithm developed by Alex Pentland at MIT.

Following the 1993 FERET face-recognition vendor test, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) offices in West Virginia and New Mexico became the first DMV offices to use automated facial recognition systems to prevent people from obtaining multiple driving licenses using different names. Driver&#x27;s licenses in the United States were at that point a commonly accepted form of photo identification. DMV offices across the United States were undergoing a technological upgrade and were in the process of establishing databases of digital ID photographs. This enabled DMV offices to deploy the facial recognition systems on the market to search photographs for new driving licenses against the existing DMV database. DMV offices became one of the first major markets for automated facial recognition technology and introduced US citizens to facial recognition as a standard method of identification. The increase of the US prison population in the 1990s prompted U.S. states to established connected and automated identification systems that incorporated digital biometric databases, in some instances this included facial recognition. In 1999, Minnesota incorporated the facial recognition system FaceIT by Visionics into a mug shot booking system that allowed police, judges and court officers to track criminals across the state.

Until the 1990s, facial recognition systems were developed primarily by using photographic portraits of human faces. Research on face recognition to reliably locate a face in an image that contains other objects gained traction in the early 1990s with the principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA method of face detection is also known as Eigenface and was developed by Matthew Turk and Alex Pentland. Turk and Pentland combined the conceptual approach of the Karhunen–Loève theorem and factor analysis, to develop a linear model. Eigenfaces are determined based on global and orthogonal features in human faces. A human face is calculated as a weighted combination of a number of Eigenfaces. Because few Eigenfaces were used to encode human faces of a given population, Turk and Pentland&#x27;s PCA face detection method greatly reduced the amount of data that had to be processed to detect a face. Pentland in 1994 defined Eigenface features, including eigen eyes, eigen mouths and eigen noses, to advance the use of PCA in facial recognition. In 1997, the PCA Eigenface method of face recognition was improved upon using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to produce Fisherfaces. LDA Fisherfaces became dominantly used in PCA feature based face recognition. While Eigenfaces were also used for face reconstruction. In these approaches no global structure of the face is calculated which links the facial features or parts.

Purely feature based approaches to facial recognition were overtaken in the late 1990s by the Bochum system, which used Gabor filter to record the face features and computed a grid of the face structure to link the features. Christoph von der Malsburg and his research team at the University of Bochum developed Elastic Bunch Graph Matching in the mid-1990s to extract a face out of an image using skin segmentation. By 1997, the face detection method developed by Malsburg outperformed most other facial detection systems on the market. The so-called &quot;Bochum system&quot; of face detection was sold commercially on the market as ZN-Face to operators of airports and other busy locations. The software was &quot;robust enough to make identifications from less-than-perfect face views. It can also often see through such impediments to identification as mustaches, beards, changed hairstyles and glasses—even sunglasses&quot;.

Real-time face detection in video footage became possible in 2001 with the Viola–Jones object detection framework for faces. Paul Viola and Michael Jones combined their face detection method with the Haar-like feature approach to object recognition in digital images to launch AdaBoost, the first real-time frontal-view face detector. By 2015, the Viola–Jones algorithm had been implemented using small low power detectors on handheld devices and embedded systems. Therefore, the Viola–Jones algorithm has not only broadened the practical application of face recognition systems but has also been used to support new features in user interfaces and teleconferencing.

Ukraine is using the US-based Clearview AI facial recognition software to identify dead Russian soldiers. Ukraine has conducted 8,600 searches and identified the families of 582 deceased Russian soldiers. The IT volunteer section of the Ukrainian army using the software is subsequently contacting the families of the deceased soldiers to raise awareness of Russian activities in Ukraine. The main goal is to destabilise the Russian government. It can be seen as a form of psychological warfare. About 340 Ukrainian government officials in five government ministries are using the technology. It is used to catch spies that might try to enter Ukraine.

Clearview AI&#x27;s facial recognition database is only available to government agencies who may only use the technology to assist in the course of law enforcement investigations or in connection with national security.

The software was donated to Ukraine by Clearview AI. Russia is thought to be using it to find anti-war activists. Clearview AI was originally designed for US law enforcement. Using it in war raises new ethical concerns. One London based surveillance expert, Stephen Hare, is concerned it might make the Ukrainians appear inhuman: &quot;Is it actually working? Or is it making [Russians] say: &#x27;Look at these lawless, cruel Ukrainians, doing this to our boys&#x27;?&quot;

== Techniques for face recognition ==
While humans can recognize faces without much effort, facial recognition is a challenging pattern recognition problem in computing. Facial recognition systems attempt to identify a human face, which is three-dimensional and changes in appearance with lighting and facial expression, based on its two-dimensional image. To accomplish this computational task, facial recognition systems perform four steps. First face detection is used to segment the face from the image background. In the second step the segmented face image is aligned to account for face pose, image size and photographic properties, such as illumination and grayscale. The purpose of the alignment process is to enable the accurate localization of facial features in the third step, the facial feature extraction. Features such as eyes, nose and mouth are pinpointed and measured in the image to represent the face. The so established feature vector of the face is then, in the fourth step, matched against a database of faces.

=== Traditional ===

Some face recognition algorithms identify facial features by extracting landmarks, or features, from an image of the subject&#x27;s face. For example, an algorithm may analyze the relative position, size, and/or shape of the eyes, nose, cheekbones, and jaw. These features are then used to search for other images with matching features.

Other algorithms normalize a gallery of face images and then compress the face data, only saving the data in the image that is useful for face recognition. A probe image is then compared with the face data. One of the earliest successful systems is based on template matching techniques applied to a set of salient facial features, providing a sort of compressed face representation.

Recognition algorithms can be divided into two main approaches: geometric, which looks at distinguishing features, or photo-metric, which is a statistical approach that distills an image into values and compares the values with templates to eliminate variances. Some classify these algorithms into two broad categories: holistic and feature-based models. The former attempts to recognize the face in its entirety while the feature-based subdivide into components such as according to features and analyze each as well as its spatial location with respect to other features.

Popular recognition algorithms include principal component analysis using eigenfaces, linear discriminant analysis, elastic bunch graph matching using the Fisherface algorithm, the hidden Markov model, the multilinear subspace learning using tensor representation, and the neuronal motivated dynamic link matching. Modern facial recognition systems make increasing use of machine learning techniques such as deep learning.

=== Human identification at a distance (HID) ===
To enable human identification at a distance (HID) low-resolution images of faces are enhanced using face hallucination. In CCTV imagery faces are often very small. But because facial recognition algorithms that identify and plot facial features require high resolution images, resolution enhancement techniques have been developed to enable facial recognition systems to work with imagery that has been captured in environments with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Face hallucination algorithms that are applied to images prior to those images being submitted to the facial recognition system use example-based machine learning with pixel substitution or nearest neighbour distribution indexes that may also incorporate demographic and age related facial characteristics. Use of face hallucination techniques improves the performance of high resolution facial recognition algorithms and may be used to overcome the inherent limitations of super-resolution algorithms. Face hallucination techniques are also used to pre-treat imagery where faces are disguised. Here the disguise, such as sunglasses, is removed and the face hallucination algorithm is applied to the image. Such face hallucination algorithms need to be trained on similar face images with and without disguise. To fill in the area uncovered by removing the disguise, face hallucination algorithms need to correctly map the entire state of the face, which may be not possible due to the momentary facial expression captured in the low resolution image.

=== 3-dimensional recognition ===

Three-dimensional face recognition technique uses 3D sensors to capture information about the shape of a face. This information is then used to identify distinctive features on the surface of a face, such as the contour of the eye sockets, nose, and chin.
One advantage of 3D face recognition is that it is not affected by changes in lighting like other techniques. It can also identify a face from a range of viewing angles, including a profile view. Three-dimensional data points from a face vastly improve the precision of face recognition. 3D-dimensional face recognition research is enabled by the development of sophisticated sensors that project structured light onto the face. 3D matching technique are sensitive to expressions, therefore researchers at Technion applied tools from metric geometry to treat expressions as isometries. A new method of capturing 3D images of faces uses three tracking cameras that point at different angles; one camera will be pointing at the front of the subject, second one to the side, and third one at an angle. All these cameras will work together so it can track a subject&#x27;s face in real-time and be able to face detect and recognize.

=== Thermal cameras ===

A different form of taking input data for face recognition is by using thermal cameras, by this procedure the cameras will only detect the shape of the head and it will ignore the subject accessories such as glasses, hats, or makeup. Unlike conventional cameras, thermal cameras can capture facial imagery even in low-light and nighttime conditions without using a flash and exposing the position of the camera. However, the databases for face recognition are limited. Efforts to build databases of thermal face images date back to 2004. By 2016, several databases existed, including the IIITD-PSE and the Notre Dame thermal face database. Current thermal face recognition systems are not able to reliably detect a face in a thermal image that has been taken of an outdoor environment.

In 2018, researchers from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) developed a technique that would allow them to match facial imagery obtained using a thermal camera with those in databases that were captured using a conventional camera. Known as a cross-spectrum synthesis method due to how it bridges facial recognition from two different imaging modalities, this method synthesize a single image by analyzing multiple facial regions and details. It consists of a non-linear regression model that maps a specific thermal image into a corresponding visible facial image and an optimization issue that projects the latent projection back into the image space. ARL scientists have noted that the approach works by combining global information (i.e. features across the entire face) with local information (i.e. features regarding the eyes, nose, and mouth). According to performance tests conducted at ARL, the multi-region cross-spectrum synthesis model demonstrated a performance improvement of about 30% over baseline methods and about 5% over state-of-the-art methods.

== Application ==
=== Social media ===
Founded in 2013, Looksery went on to raise money for its face modification app on Kickstarter. After successful crowdfunding, Looksery launched in October 2014. The application allows video chat with others through a special filter for faces that modifies the look of users. Image augmenting applications already on the market, such as Facetune and Perfect365, were limited to static images, whereas Looksery allowed augmented reality to live videos. In late 2015 SnapChat purchased Looksery, which would then become its landmark lenses function. Snapchat filter applications use face detection technology and on the basis of the facial features identified in an image a 3D mesh mask is layered over the face. A variety of technologies attempt to fool facial recognition software by the use of anti-facial recognition masks.

DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook. It identifies human faces in digital images. It employs a nine-layer neural net with over 120 million connection weights, and was trained on four million images uploaded by Facebook users. The system is said to be 97% accurate, compared to 85% for the FBI&#x27;s Next Generation Identification system.

TikTok&#x27;s algorithm has been regarded as especially effective, but many were left to wonder at the exact programming that caused the app to be so effective in guessing the user&#x27;s desired content. In June 2020, TikTok released a statement regarding the &quot;For You&quot; page, and how they recommended videos to users, which did not include facial recognition. In February 2021, however, TikTok agreed to a $92 million settlement to a US lawsuit which alleged that the app had used facial recognition in both user videos and its algorithm to identify age, gender and ethnicity.

=== ID verification ===
The emerging use of facial recognition is in the use of ID verification services. Many companies and others are working in the market now to provide these services to banks, ICOs, and other e-businesses. Face recognition has been leveraged as a form of biometric authentication for various computing platforms and devices; Android 4.0 &quot;Ice Cream Sandwich&quot; added facial recognition using a smartphone&#x27;s front camera as a means of unlocking devices, while Microsoft introduced face recognition login to its Xbox 360 video game console through its Kinect accessory, as well as Windows 10 via its &quot;Windows Hello&quot; platform (which requires an infrared-illuminated camera). In 2017, Apple&#x27;s iPhone X smartphone introduced facial recognition to the product line with its &quot;Face ID&quot; platform, which uses an infrared illumination system.

==== Face ID ====
Apple introduced Face ID on the flagship iPhone X as a biometric authentication successor to the Touch ID, a fingerprint based system. Face ID has a facial recognition sensor that consists of two parts: a &quot;Romeo&quot; module that projects more than 30,000 infrared dots onto the user&#x27;s face, and a &quot;Juliet&quot; module that reads the pattern. The pattern is sent to a local &quot;Secure Enclave&quot; in the device&#x27;s central processing unit (CPU) to confirm a match with the phone owner&#x27;s face.

The facial pattern is not accessible by Apple. The system will not work with eyes closed, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access. The technology learns from changes in a user&#x27;s appearance, and therefore works with hats, scarves, glasses, and many sunglasses, beard and makeup. It also works in the dark. This is done by using a &quot;Flood Illuminator&quot;, which is a dedicated infrared flash that throws out invisible infrared light onto the user&#x27;s face to properly read the 30,000 facial points.

=== Healthcare ===
Facial recognition algorithms can help in diagnosing some diseases using specific features on the nose, cheeks and other part of the human face. Relying on developed data sets, machine learning has been used to identify genetic abnormalities just based on facial dimensions. FRT has also been used to verify patients before surgery procedures.

In March, 2022 according to a publication by Forbes, FDNA, an AI development company claimed that in the space of 10 years, they have worked with geneticists to develop a database of about 5,000 diseases and 1500 of them can be detected with facial recognition algorithms.

=== Deployment of FRT for availing government services ===

==== India ====
In an interview, the National Health Authority chief Dr. R.S. Sharma said that facial recognition technology would be used in conjunction with Aadhaar to authenticate the identity of people seeking vaccines. Ten human rights and digital rights organizations and more than 150 individuals signed a statement by the Internet Freedom Foundation that raised alarm against the deployment of facial recognition technology in the central government&#x27;s vaccination drive process. Implementation of an error-prone system without adequate legislation containing mandatory safeguards, would deprive citizens of essential services and linking this untested technology to the vaccination roll-out in India will only exclude persons from the vaccine delivery system.

In July, 2021, a press release by the Government of Meghalaya stated that facial recognition technology (FRT) would be used to verify the identity of pensioners to issue a Digital Life Certificate using &quot;Pensioner&#x27;s Life Certification Verification&quot; mobile application. The notice, according to the press release, purports to offer pensioners &quot;a secure, easy and hassle-free interface for verifying their liveness to the Pension Disbursing Authorities from the comfort of their homes using smart phones&quot;. Mr. Jade Jeremiah Lyngdoh, a law student, sent a legal notice to the relevant authorities highlighting that &quot;The application has been rolled out without any anchoring legislation which governs the processing of personal data and thus, lacks lawfulness and the Government is not empowered to process data.&quot;

=== Deployment in security services ===
==== Commonwealth ====
The Australian Border Force and New Zealand Customs Service have set up an automated border processing system called SmartGate that uses face recognition, which compares the face of the traveller with the data in the e-passport microchip. All Canadian international airports use facial recognition as part of the Primary Inspection Kiosk program that compares a traveler face to their photo stored on the ePassport. This program first came to Vancouver International Airport in early 2017 and was rolled up to all remaining international airports in 2018–2019.

Police forces in the United Kingdom have been trialing live facial recognition technology at public events since 2015. In May 2017, a man was arrested using an automatic facial recognition (AFR) system mounted on a van operated by the South Wales Police. Ars Technica reported that &quot;this appears to be the first time [AFR] has led to an arrest&quot;. However, a 2018 report by Big Brother Watch found that these systems were up to 98% inaccurate. The report also revealed that two UK police forces, South Wales Police and the Metropolitan Police, were using live facial recognition at public events and in public spaces. 
In September 2019, South Wales Police use of facial recognition was ruled lawful. Live facial recognition has been trialled since 2016 in the streets of London and will be used on a regular basis from Metropolitan Police from beginning of 2020. In August 2020 the Court of Appeal ruled that the way the facial recognition system had been used by the South Wales Police in 2017 and 2018 violated human rights.

However, by 2024 the Metropolitan Police were using the technique with a database of 16,000 suspects, leading to over 360 arrests, including rapists and someone wanted for grievous bodily harm for 8 years. They claim a false positive rate of only 1 in 6,000. The photos of those not identified by the system are deleted immediately.

==== United States ====

The U.S. Department of State operates one of the largest face recognition systems in the world with a database of 117 million American adults, with photos typically drawn from driver&#x27;s license photos. Although it is still far from completion, it is being put to use in certain cities to give clues as to who was in the photo. The FBI uses the photos as an investigative tool, not for positive identification. facial recognition was being used to identify people in photos taken by police in San Diego and Los Angeles (not on real-time video, and only against booking photos) and use was planned in West Virginia and Dallas.

In recent years Maryland has used face recognition by comparing people&#x27;s faces to their driver&#x27;s license photos. The system drew controversy when it was used in Baltimore to arrest unruly protesters after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody. Many other states are using or developing a similar system however some states have laws prohibiting its use.

The FBI has also instituted its Next Generation Identification program to include face recognition, as well as more traditional biometrics like fingerprints and iris scans, which can pull from both criminal and civil databases. The federal Government Accountability Office criticized the FBI for not addressing various concerns related to privacy and accuracy.

Starting in 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Protection deployed &quot;biometric face scanners&quot; at U.S. airports. Passengers taking outbound international flights can complete the check-in, security and the boarding process after getting facial images captured and verified by matching their ID photos stored on CBP&#x27;s database. Images captured for travelers with U.S. citizenship will be deleted within up to 12-hours. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) had expressed its intention to adopt a similar program for domestic air travel during the security check process in the future. The American Civil Liberties Union is one of the organizations against the program, concerning that the program will be used for surveillance purposes.

In 2019, researchers reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) uses facial recognition software against state driver&#x27;s license databases, including for some states that provide licenses to undocumented immigrants.

In December 2022, 16 major domestic airports in the US started testing facial-recognition tech where kiosks with cameras are checking the photos on travelers&#x27; IDs to make sure that passengers are not impostors.

==== China ====

In 2006, the &quot;Skynet&quot; (天網）)Project was initiated by the Chinese government to implement CCTV surveillance nationwide and there have been 20 million cameras, many of which are capable of real-time facial recognition, deployed across the country for this project. Some official claim that the current Skynet system can scan the entire Chinese population in one second and the world population in two seconds.

In 2017, the Qingdao police was able to identify twenty-five wanted suspects using facial recognition equipment at the Qingdao International Beer Festival, one of which had been on the run for 10 years. The equipment works by recording a 15-second video clip and taking multiple snapshots of the subject. That data is compared and analyzed with images from the police department&#x27;s database and within 20 minutes, the subject can be identified with a 98.1% accuracy.

In 2018, Chinese police in Zhengzhou and Beijing were using smart glasses to take photos which are compared against a government database using facial recognition to identify suspects, retrieve an address, and track people moving beyond their home areas.

 China has deployed facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology in Xinjiang. Reporters visiting the region found surveillance cameras installed every hundred meters or so in several cities, as well as facial recognition checkpoints at areas like gas stations, shopping centers, and mosque entrances. In May 2019, Human Rights Watch reported finding Face++ code in the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), a police surveillance app used to collect data on, and track the Uighur community in Xinjiang. Human Rights Watch released a correction to its report in June 2019 stating that the Chinese company Megvii did not appear to have collaborated on IJOP, and that the Face++ code in the app was inoperable. In February 2020, following the Coronavirus outbreak, Megvii applied for a bank loan to optimize the body temperature screening system it had launched to help identify people with symptoms of a Coronavirus infection in crowds. In the loan application Megvii stated that it needed to improve the accuracy of identifying masked individuals.

Many public places in China are implemented with facial recognition equipment, including railway stations, airports, tourist attractions, expos, and office buildings. In October 2019, a professor at Zhejiang Sci-Tech University sued the Hangzhou Safari Park for abusing private biometric information of customers. The safari park uses facial recognition technology to verify the identities of its Year Card holders. An estimated 300 tourist sites in China have installed facial recognition systems and use them to admit visitors. This case is reported to be the first on the use of facial recognition systems in China. In August 2020, Radio Free Asia reported that in 2019 Geng Guanjun, a citizen of Taiyuan City who had used the WeChat app by Tencent to forward a video to a friend in the United States was subsequently convicted on the charge of the crime &quot;picking quarrels and provoking troubles&quot;. The Court documents showed that the Chinese police used a facial recognition system to identify Geng Guanjun as an &quot;overseas democracy activist&quot; and that China&#x27;s network management and propaganda departments directly monitor WeChat users.

In 2019, Protestors in Hong Kong destroyed smart lampposts amid concerns they could contain cameras and facial recognition system used for surveillance by Chinese authorities. Human rights groups have criticized the Chinese government for using artificial intelligence facial recognition technology in its suppression against Uyghurs, Christians and Falun Gong practitioners.

==== India ====

Even though facial recognition technology (FRT) is not fully accurate, it is being increasingly deployed for identification purposes by the police in India. FRT systems generate a probability match score, or a confidence score between the suspect who is to be identified and the database of identified criminals that is available with the police. The National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) is already being developed by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a body constituted under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The project seeks to develop and deploy a national database of photographs which would comport with a facial recognition technology system by the central and state security agencies. The Internet Freedom Foundation has flagged concerns regarding the project. The NGO has highlighted that the accuracy of FRT systems are &quot;routinely exaggerated and the real numbers leave much to be desired. The implementation of such faulty FRT systems would lead to high rates of false positives and false negatives in this recognition process.&quot; 

Under the Supreme Court of India&#x27;s decision in &quot;Justice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India&quot; (22017 10 SCC 1), any justifiable intrusion by the State into people&#x27;s right to privacy, which is protected as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution, must confirm to certain thresholds, namely: legality, necessity, proportionality and procedural safeguards. As per the Internet Freedom Foundation, the National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) proposal fails to meet any of these thresholds, citing &quot;absence of legality,&quot; &quot;manifest arbitrariness,&quot; and &quot;absence of safeguards and accountability.&quot;

While the national level AFRS project is still in the works, police departments in various states in India are already deploying facial recognition technology systems, such as: TSCOP + CCTNS in Telangana, Punjab Artificial Intelligence System (PAIS) in Punjab, Trinetra in Uttar Pradesh, Police Artificial Intelligence System in Uttarakhand, AFRS in Delhi, Automated Multimodal Biometric Identification System (AMBIS) in Maharashtra, FaceTagr in Tamil Nadu. The Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS), which is a Mission Mode Project under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), is viewed as a system which would connect police stations across India, and help them &quot;talk&quot; to each other. The project&#x27;s objective is to digitize all FIR-related information, including FIRs registered, as well as cases investigated, charge sheets filed, and suspects and wanted persons in all police stations. This shall constitute a national database of crime and criminals in India. CCTNS is being implemented without a data protection law in place. CCTNS is proposed to be integrated with the AFRS, a repository of all crime and criminal related facial data which can be deployed to purportedly identify or verify a person from a variety of inputs ranging from images to videos. This has raised privacy concerns from civil society organizations and privacy experts. Both the projects have been censured as instruments of &quot;mass surveillance&quot; at the hands of the state. In Rajasthan, &#x27;RajCop,&#x27; a police app has been recently integrated with a facial recognition module which can match the face of a suspect against a database of known persons in real-time. Rajasthan police is in currently working to widen the ambit of this module by making it mandatory to upload photographs of all arrested persons in CCTNS database, which will &quot;help develop a rich database of known offenders.&quot;

Helmets fixed with camera have been designed and being used by Rajasthan police in law and order situations to capture police action and activities of &quot;the miscreants, which can later serve as evidence during the investigation of such cases.&quot; PAIS (Punjab Artificial Intelligence System), App employs deep learning, machine learning, and face recognition for the identification of criminals to assist police personnel. The state of Telangana has installed 8 lakh CCTV cameras, with its capital city Hyderabad slowly turning into a surveillance capital.

A false positive happens when facial recognition technology misidentifies a person to be someone they are not, that is, it yields an incorrect positive result. They often results in discrimination and strengthening of existing biases. For example, in 2018, Delhi Police reported that its FRT system had an accuracy rate of 2%, which sank to 1% in 2019. The FRT system even failed to distinguish accurately between different sexes.

The government of Delhi in collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is developing a new technology called Crime Mapping Analytics and Predictive System (CMAPS). The project aims to deploy space technology for &quot;controlling crime and maintaining law and order.&quot; The system will be connected to a database containing data of criminals. The technology is envisaged to be deployed to collect real-time data at the crime scene.

In a reply dated November 25, 2020 to a Right to Information request filed by the Internet Freedom Foundation seeking information about the facial recognition system being used by the Delhi Police (with reference number DEPOL/R/E/20/07128), the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police cum Public Information Officer: Crime stated that they cannot provide the information under section 8(d) of the Right to Information Act, 2005.
A Right to Information (RTI) request dated July 30, 2020 was filed with the Office of the Commissioner, Kolkata Police, seeking information about the facial recognition technology that the department was using. The information sought was denied stating that the department was exempted from disclosure under section 24(4) of the RTI Act.

==== Latin America ====
In the 2000 Mexican presidential election, the Mexican government employed face recognition software to prevent voter fraud. Some individuals had been registering to vote under several different names, in an attempt to place multiple votes. By comparing new face images to those already in the voter database, authorities were able to reduce duplicate registrations.

In Colombia public transport busses are fitted with a facial recognition system by FaceFirst Inc to identify passengers that are sought by the National Police of Colombia. FaceFirst Inc also built the facial recognition system for Tocumen International Airport in Panama. The face recognition system is deployed to identify individuals among the travellers that are sought by the Panamanian National Police or Interpol. Tocumen International Airport operates an airport-wide surveillance system using hundreds of live face recognition cameras to identify wanted individuals passing through the airport. The face recognition system was initially installed as part of a US$11 million contract and included a computer cluster of sixty computers, a fiber-optic cable network for the airport buildings, as well as the installation of 150 surveillance cameras in the airport terminal and at about 30 airport gates.

At the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil the Federal Police of Brazil used face recognition goggles. Face recognition systems &quot;made in China&quot; were also deployed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Nuctech Company provided 145 inspection terminals for Maracanã Stadium and 55 terminals for the Deodoro Olympic Park.

==== European Union ====
Police forces in at least 21 countries of the European Union use, or plan to use, facial recognition systems, either for administrative or criminal purposes.

===== Greece =====
Greek police passed a contract with Intracom-Telecom for the provision of at least 1,000 devices equipped with live facial recognition system. The delivery is expected before the summer 2021. The total value of the contract is over 4 million euros, paid for in large part by the Internal Security Fund of the European Commission.

===== Italy =====
Italian police acquired a face recognition system in 2017, Sistema Automatico Riconoscimento Immagini (SARI). In November 2020, the Interior ministry announced plans to use it in real-time to identify people suspected of seeking asylum.

===== The Netherlands =====
The Netherlands has deployed facial recognition and artificial intelligence technology since 2016. The database of the Dutch police currently contains over 2.2 million pictures of 1.3 million Dutch citizens. This accounts for about 8% of the population. In The Netherlands, face recognition is not used by the police on municipal CCTV.

==== South Africa ====
In South Africa, in 2016, the city of Johannesburg announced it was rolling out smart CCTV cameras complete with automatic number plate recognition and facial recognition.

=== Deployment in retail stores ===
The US firm 3VR, now Identiv, is an example of a vendor which began offering facial recognition systems and services to retailers as early as 2007. In 2012, the company advertised benefits such as &quot;dwell and queue line analytics to decrease customer wait times&quot;, &quot;facial surveillance analytic[s] to facilitate personalized customer greetings by employees&quot; and the ability to &quot;[c]reate loyalty programs by combining Point of sale (POS) data with facial recognition&quot;.

==== United States ====
In 2018, the National Retail Federation Loss Prevention Research Council called facial recognition technology &quot;a promising new tool&quot; worth evaluating.

In July 2020, the Reuters news agency reported that during the 2010s the pharmacy chain Rite Aid had deployed facial recognition video surveillance systems and components from FaceFirst, DeepCam LLC, and other vendors at some retail locations in the United States. Cathy Langley, Rite Aid&#x27;s vice president of asset protection, used the phrase &quot;feature matching&quot; to refer to the systems and said that usage of the systems resulted in less violence and organized crime in the company&#x27;s stores, while former vice president of asset protection Bob Oberosler emphasized improved safety for staff and a reduced need for the involvement of law enforcement organizations. In a 2020 statement to Reuters in response to the reporting, Rite Aid said that it had ceased using the facial recognition software and switched off the cameras.

According to director of the National Retail Federation Loss Prevention Research Council, Rite Aid&#x27;s surveillance program was either the largest or one of the largest programs in retail. The Home Depot, Menards, Walmart, and 7-Eleven are among other US retailers also engaged in large-scale pilot programs or deployments of facial recognition technology.

Of the Rite Aid stores examined by Reuters in 2020, those in communities where people of color made up the largest racial or ethnic group were three times as likely to have the technology installed, raising concerns related to the substantial history of racial segregation and racial profiling in the United States. Rite Aid said that the selection of locations was &quot;data-driven&quot;, based on the theft histories of individual stores, local and national crime data, and site infrastructure.

==== Australia ====
In 2019, facial recognition to prevent theft was in use at Sydney&#x27;s Star Casino and was also deployed at gaming venues in New Zealand.

In June 2022, consumer group CHOICE reported facial recognition was in use in Australia at Kmart, Bunnings, and The Good Guys. The Good Guys subsequently suspended the technology pending a legal challenge by CHOICE to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, while Bunnings kept the technology in use and Kmart maintained its trial of the technology.

=== Additional uses ===

At the American football championship game Super Bowl XXXV in January 2001, police in Tampa Bay, Florida used Viisage face recognition software to search for potential criminals and terrorists in attendance at the event. 19 people with minor criminal records were potentially identified.

Face recognition systems have also been used by photo management software to identify the subjects of photographs, enabling features such as searching images by person, as well as suggesting photos to be shared with a specific contact if their presence were detected in a photo. By 2008 facial recognition systems were typically used as access control in security systems.

The United States&#x27; popular music and country music celebrity Taylor Swift surreptitiously employed facial recognition technology at a concert in 2018. The camera was embedded in a kiosk near a ticket booth and scanned concert-goers as they entered the facility for known stalkers.

On August 18, 2019, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the UAE-owned Manchester City hired a Texas-based firm, Blink Identity, to deploy facial recognition systems in a driver program. The club has planned a single super-fast lane for the supporters at the Etihad stadium. However, civil rights groups cautioned the club against the introduction of this technology, saying that it would risk &quot;normalising a mass surveillance tool&quot;. The policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, Hannah Couchman said that Man City&#x27;s move is alarming, since the fans will be obliged to share deeply sensitive personal information with a private company, where they could be tracked and monitored in their everyday lives.

In 2019, casinos in Australia and New Zealand rolled out facial recognition to prevent theft, and a representative of Sydney&#x27;s Star Casino said they would also provide &#x27;customer service&#x27; like welcoming a patron back to a bar.

In August 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, American football stadiums of New York and Los Angeles announced the installation of facial recognition for upcoming matches. The purpose is to make the entry process as touchless as possible. Disney&#x27;s Magic Kingdom, near Orlando, Florida, likewise announced a test of facial recognition technology to create a touchless experience during the pandemic; the test was originally slated to take place between March 23 and April 23, 2021, but the limited timeframe had been removed 

Media companies have begun using face recognition technology to streamline their tracking, organizing, and archiving pictures and videos.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
=== Compared to other biometric systems ===
In 2006, the performance of the latest face recognition algorithms was evaluated in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC). High-resolution face images, 3-D face scans, and iris images were used in the tests. The results indicated that the new algorithms are 10 times more accurate than the face recognition algorithms of 2002 and 100 times more accurate than those of 1995. Some of the algorithms were able to outperform human participants in recognizing faces and could uniquely identify identical twins.

One key advantage of a facial recognition system that it is able to perform mass identification as it does not require the cooperation of the test subject to work. Properly designed systems installed in airports, multiplexes, and other public places can identify individuals among the crowd, without passers-by even being aware of the system. However, as compared to other biometric techniques, face recognition may not be most reliable and efficient. Quality measures are very important in facial recognition systems as large degrees of variations are possible in face images. Factors such as illumination, expression, pose and noise during face capture can affect the performance of facial recognition systems. Among all biometric systems, facial recognition has the highest false acceptance and rejection rates, thus questions have been raised on the effectiveness of or bias of face recognition software in cases of railway and airport security, law enforcement and housing and employment decisions.

=== Weaknesses ===
Ralph Gross, a researcher at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute in 2008, describes one obstacle related to the viewing angle of the face: &quot;Face recognition has been getting pretty good at full frontal faces and 20 degrees off, but as soon as you go towards profile, there&#x27;ve been problems.&quot; Besides the pose variations, low-resolution face images are also very hard to recognize. This is one of the main obstacles of face recognition in surveillance systems. It has also been suggested that camera settings can favour sharper imagery of white skin than of other skin tones.

Face recognition is less effective if facial expressions vary. A big smile can render the system less effective. For instance: Canada, in 2009, allowed only neutral facial expressions in passport photos.

There is also inconstancy in the datasets used by researchers. Researchers may use anywhere from several subjects to scores of subjects and a few hundred images to thousands of images. Data sets may be diverse and inclusive or mainly contain images of white males. It is important for researchers to make available the datasets they used to each other, or have at least a standard or representative dataset.

Although high degrees of accuracy have been claimed for some facial recognition systems, these outcomes are not universal. The consistently worst accuracy rate is for those who are 18 to 30 years old, Black and female.

=== Racial bias and skin tone ===

Studies have shown that facial recognition algorithms tend to perform better on individuals with lighter skin tones compared to those with darker skin tones. This disparity arises primarily because training datasets often overrepresent lighter-skinned individuals, leading to higher error rates for darker-skinned people. For example, a 2018 study found that leading commercial gender classification models, which are facial recognition models, have an error rate up to 7 times higher for those with darker skin tones compared to those with lighter skin tones.

Common image compression methods, such as JPEG chroma subsampling, have been found to disproportionately degrade performance for darker-skinned individuals. These methods inadequately represent color information, which adversely affects the ability of algorithms to recognize darker-skinned individuals accurately.

=== Cross-race effect bias ===

Facial recognition systems often demonstrate lower accuracy when identifying individuals with non-Eurocentric facial features. Known as the Cross-race effect, this bias occurs when systems perform better on racial or ethnic groups that are overrepresented in their training data, resulting in reduced accuracy for underrepresented groups. The overrepresented group is generally the more populous group in the location that the model is being developed. For example, models developed in Asian cultures generally perform better on Asian facial features than Eurocentric facial features due to overrepresentation in the developers training dataset. The opposite is observed in models developed in Eurocentric cultures.

The systems used for facial recognition often lack the sufficient training needed to fully recognize those features not of Eurocentric descent. When the training and databases for these Machine Learning (ML) models do not contain a diverse representation, the models fail to identify the missed population, adding to their racial biases. 

The cross-race effect is not exclusive to machines; humans also experience difficulty recognizing faces from racial or ethnic groups different from their own. This is an example of inherent human biases being perpetuated in training datasets. 

=== Challenges for individuals with disabilities ===

Facial recognition technologies encounter significant challenges when identifying individuals with disabilities. For instance, systems have been shown to perform worse when recognizing individuals with Down syndrome, often leading to increased false match rates. This is due to distinct facial structures associated with the condition that are not adequately represented in training datasets.

More broadly, facial recognition systems tend to overlook diverse physical characteristics related to disabilities. The lack of representative data for individuals with varying disabilities further emphasizes the need for inclusive algorithmic designs to mitigate bias and improve accuracy.

Additionally, facial expression recognition technologies often fail to accurately interpret the emotional states of individuals with intellectual disabilities. This shortcoming can hinder effective communication and interaction, underscoring the necessity for systems trained on diverse datasets that include individuals with intellectual disabilities.

Furthermore, biases in facial recognition algorithms can lead to discriminatory outcomes for people with disabilities. For example, certain facial features or asymmetries may result in misidentification or exclusion, highlighting the importance of developing accessible and fair biometric systems.

=== Advancements in fairness and mitigation strategies ===

Efforts to address these biases include designing algorithms specifically for fairness. A notable study introduced a method to learn fair face representations by using a progressive cross-transformer model. This approach highlights the importance of balancing accuracy across demographic groups while avoiding performance drops in specific populations.

Additionally, targeted dataset collection has been shown to improve racial equity in facial recognition systems. By prioritizing diverse data inputs, researchers demonstrated measurable reductions in performance disparities between racial groups.

=== Ineffectiveness ===
Critics of the technology complain that the London Borough of Newham scheme has, never recognized a single criminal, despite several criminals in the system&#x27;s database living in the Borough and the system has been running for several years. &quot;Not once, as far as the police know, has Newham&#x27;s automatic face recognition system spotted a live target.&quot; This information seems to conflict with claims that the system was credited with a 34% reduction in crime (hence why it was rolled out to Birmingham also).

An experiment in 2002 by the local police department in Tampa, Florida, had similarly disappointing results. A system at Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport was shut down in 2003 after failing to make any matches during a two-year test period.

In 2014, Facebook stated that in a standardized two-option facial recognition test, its online system scored 97.25% accuracy, compared to the human benchmark of 97.5%.

Systems are often advertised as having accuracy near 100%; this is misleading as the outcomes are not universal The studies often use samples that are smaller and less diverse than would be necessary for large scale applications. Because facial recognition is not completely accurate, it creates a list of potential matches. A human operator must then look through these potential matches and studies show the operators pick the correct match out of the list only about half the time. This causes the issue of targeting the wrong suspect.

== Controversies ==
=== Privacy violations ===
Civil rights organizations and privacy campaigners such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Big Brother Watch and the ACLU express concern that privacy is being compromised by the use of surveillance technologies. Face recognition can be used not just to identify an individual, but also to unearth other personal data associated with an individual – such as other photos featuring the individual, blog posts, social media profiles, Internet behavior, and travel patterns. Concerns have been raised over who would have access to the knowledge of one&#x27;s whereabouts and people with them at any given time. Moreover, individuals have limited ability to avoid or thwart face recognition tracking unless they hide their faces. This fundamentally changes the dynamic of day-to-day privacy by enabling any marketer, government agency, or random stranger to secretly collect the identities and associated personal information of any individual captured by the face recognition system. Consumers may not understand or be aware of what their data is being used for, which denies them the ability to consent to how their personal information gets shared.

In July 2015, the United States Government Accountability Office conducted a Report to the Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate. The report discussed facial recognition technology&#x27;s commercial uses, privacy issues, and the applicable federal law. It states that previously, issues concerning facial recognition technology were discussed and represent the need for updating the privacy laws of the United States so that federal law continually matches the impact of advanced technologies. The report noted that some industry, government, and private organizations were in the process of developing, or have developed, &quot;voluntary privacy guidelines&quot;. These guidelines varied between the stakeholders, but their overall aim was to gain consent and inform citizens of the intended use of facial recognition technology. According to the report the voluntary privacy guidelines helped to counteract the privacy concerns that arise when citizens are unaware of how their personal data gets put to use.

In 2016, Russian company NtechLab caused a privacy scandal in the international media when it launched the FindFace face recognition system with the promise that Russian users could take photos of strangers in the street and link them to a social media profile on the social media platform Vkontakte (VK). In December 2017, Facebook rolled out a new feature that notifies a user when someone uploads a photo that includes what Facebook thinks is their face, even if they are not tagged. Facebook has attempted to frame the new functionality in a positive light, amidst prior backlashes. Facebook&#x27;s head of privacy, Rob Sherman, addressed this new feature as one that gives people more control over their photos online. &quot;We&#x27;ve thought about this as a really empowering feature,&quot; he says. &quot;There may be photos that exist that you don&#x27;t know about.&quot; Facebook&#x27;s DeepFace has become the subject of several class action lawsuits under the Biometric Information Privacy Act, with claims alleging that Facebook is collecting and storing face recognition data of its users without obtaining informed consent, in direct violation of the 2008 Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The most recent case was dismissed in January 2016 because the court lacked jurisdiction. In the US, surveillance companies such as Clearview AI are relying on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to data scrape user accounts on social media platforms for data that can be used in the development of facial recognition systems.

In 2019, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; first reported that facial recognition software was in use in the King&#x27;s Cross area of London. The development around London&#x27;s King&#x27;s Cross mainline station includes shops, offices, Google&#x27;s UK HQ and part of St Martin&#x27;s College. According to the UK Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office: &quot;Scanning people&#x27;s faces as they lawfully go about their daily lives, in order to identify them, is a potential threat to privacy that should concern us all.&quot; The UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham launched an investigation into the use of the King&#x27;s Cross facial recognition system, operated by the company Argent. In September 2019 it was announced by Argent that facial recognition software would no longer be used at King&#x27;s Cross. Argent claimed that the software had been deployed between May 2016 and March 2018 on two cameras covering a pedestrian street running through the centre of the development. In October 2019, a report by the deputy London mayor Sophie Linden revealed that in a secret deal the Metropolitan Police had passed photos of seven people to Argent for use in their King&#x27;s cross facial recognition system.

Automated Facial Recognition was trialled by the South Wales Police on multiple occasions between 2017 and 2019. The use of the technology was challenged in court by a private individual, Edward Bridges, with support from the charity Liberty (case known as R (Bridges) v Chief Constable South Wales Police). The case was heard in the Court of Appeal and a judgement was given in August 2020. The case argued that the use of Facial Recognition was a privacy violation on the basis that there was insufficient legal framework or proportionality in the use of Facial Recognition and that its use was in violation of the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2018. The case was decided in favour of Bridges and did not award damages. The case was settled via a declaration of wrongdoing. In response to the case, the British Government has repeatedly attempted to pass a Bill regulating the use of Facial Recognition in public spaces. The proposed Bills have attempted to appoint a Commissioner with the ability to regulate Facial Recognition use by Government Services in a similar manner to the Commissioner for CCTV. Such a Bill has yet to come into force [correct ].

In January 2023, New York Attorney General Letitia James asked for more information on the use of facial recognition technology from Madison Square Garden Entertainment following reports that the firm used it to block lawyers involved in litigation against the company from entering Madison Square Garden. She noted such a move would could go against federal, state, and local human rights laws.

=== Imperfect technology in law enforcement ===
 it is still contested as to whether or not facial recognition technology works less accurately on people of color. One study by Joy Buolamwini (MIT Media Lab) and Timnit Gebru (Microsoft Research) found that the error rate for gender recognition for women of color within three commercial facial recognition systems ranged from 23.8% to 36%, whereas for lighter-skinned men it was between 0.0 and 1.6%. Overall accuracy rates for identifying men (91.9%) were higher than for women (79.4%), and none of the systems accommodated a non-binary understanding of gender. It also showed that the datasets used to train commercial facial recognition models were unrepresentative of the broader population and skewed toward lighter-skinned males. However, another study showed that several commercial facial recognition software sold to law enforcement offices around the country had a lower false non-match rate for black people than for white people.

Experts fear that face recognition systems may actually be hurting citizens the police claims they are trying to protect. It is considered an imperfect biometric, and in a study conducted by Georgetown University researcher Clare Garvie, she concluded that &quot;there&#x27;s no consensus in the scientific community that it provides a positive identification of somebody.&quot; It is believed that with such large margins of error in this technology, both legal advocates and facial recognition software companies say that the technology should only supply a portion of the case – no evidence that can lead to an arrest of an individual. The lack of regulations holding facial recognition technology companies to requirements of racially biased testing can be a significant flaw in the adoption of use in law enforcement. CyberExtruder, a company that markets itself to law enforcement said that they had not performed testing or research on bias in their software. CyberExtruder did note that some skin colors are more difficult for the software to recognize with current limitations of the technology. &quot;Just as individuals with very dark skin are hard to identify with high significance via facial recognition, individuals with very pale skin are the same,&quot; said Blake Senftner, a senior software engineer at CyberExtruder.

The United States&#x27; National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) carried out extensive testing of FRT system 1:1 verification and 1:many identification. It also tested for the differing accuracy of FRT across different demographic groups. The independent study concluded at present, no FRT system has 100% accuracy.

=== Data protection ===
In 2010, Peru passed the Law for Personal Data Protection, which defines biometric information that can be used to identify an individual as sensitive data. In 2012, Colombia passed a comprehensive Data Protection Law which defines biometric data as senstivite information. According to Article 9(1) of the EU&#x27;s 2016 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the processing of biometric data for the purpose of &quot;uniquely identifying a natural person&quot; is sensitive and the facial recognition data processed in this way becomes sensitive personal data. In response to the GDPR passing into the law of EU member states, EU based researchers voiced concern that if they were required under the GDPR to obtain individual&#x27;s consent for the processing of their facial recognition data, a face database on the scale of MegaFace could never be established again. In September 2019 the Swedish Data Protection Authority (DPA) issued its first ever financial penalty for a violation of the EU&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) against a school that was using the technology to replace time-consuming roll calls during class. The DPA found that the school illegally obtained the biometric data of its students without completing an impact assessment. In addition the school did not make the DPA aware of the pilot scheme. A 200,000 SEK fine (€19,000/$21,000) was issued.

In the United States of America several U.S. states have passed laws to protect the privacy of biometric data. Examples include the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). In March 2020 California residents filed a class action against Clearview AI, alleging that the company had illegally collected biometric data online and with the help of face recognition technology built up a database of biometric data which was sold to companies and police forces. At the time Clearview AI already faced two lawsuits under BIPA and an investigation by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada for compliance with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).

== Bans on the use of facial recognition technology ==
===United States of America===
In May 2019, San Francisco, California became the first major United States city to ban the use of facial recognition software for police and other local government agencies&#x27; usage. San Francisco Supervisor, Aaron Peskin, introduced regulations that will require agencies to gain approval from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to purchase surveillance technology. The regulations also require that agencies publicly disclose the intended use for new surveillance technology. In June 2019, Somerville, Massachusetts became the first city on the East Coast to ban face surveillance software for government use, specifically in police investigations and municipal surveillance. In July 2019, Oakland, California banned the usage of facial recognition technology by city departments.

The American Civil Liberties Union (&quot;ACLU&quot;) has campaigned across the United States for transparency in surveillance technology and has supported both San Francisco and Somerville&#x27;s ban on facial recognition software. The ACLU works to challenge the secrecy and surveillance with this technology.

During the George Floyd protests, use of facial recognition by city government was banned in Boston, Massachusetts. municipal use has been banned in:
* Berkeley, California
* Oakland, California
* Boston, Massachusetts – June 30, 2020
* Brookline, Massachusetts
* Cambridge, Massachusetts
* Northampton, Massachusetts
* Springfield, Massachusetts
* Somerville, Massachusetts
* Portland, Oregon – September 2020

The West Lafayette, Indiana City Council passed an ordinance banning facial recognition surveillance technology.

On October 27, 2020, 22 human rights groups called upon the University of Miami to ban facial recognition technology. This came after the students accused the school of using the software to identify student protesters. The allegations were, however, denied by the university.

A state police reform law in Massachusetts will take effect in July 2021; a ban passed by the legislature was rejected by governor Charlie Baker. Instead, the law requires a judicial warrant, limit the personnel who can perform the search, record data about how the technology is used, and create a commission to make recommendations about future regulations.

Reports in 2024 revealed that some police departments, including San Francisco Police Department, had skirted bans on facial recognition technology that had been enacted in their respective cities.

===European Union===
In January 2020, the European Union suggested, but then quickly scrapped, a proposed moratorium on facial recognition in public spaces.

The European &quot;Reclaim Your Face&quot; coalition launched in October 2020. The coalition calls for a ban on facial recognition and launched a European Citizens&#x27; Initiative in February 2021. More than 60 organizations call on the European Commission to strictly regulate the use of biometric surveillance technologies.

== Emotion recognition ==
In the 18th and 19th century, the belief that facial expressions revealed the moral worth or true inner state of a human was widespread and physiognomy was a respected science in the Western world. From the early 19th century onwards photography was used in the physiognomic analysis of facial features and facial expression to detect insanity and dementia. In the 1960s and 1970s the study of human emotions and its expressions was reinvented by psychologists, who tried to define a normal range of emotional responses to events. The research on automated emotion recognition has since the 1970s focused on facial expressions and speech, which are regarded as the two most important ways in which humans communicate emotions to other humans. In the 1970s the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) categorization for the physical expression of emotions was established. Its developer Paul Ekman maintains that there are six emotions that are universal to all human beings and that these can be coded in facial expressions. Research into automatic emotion specific expression recognition has in the past decades focused on frontal view images of human faces. Facial thermography can be considered as a promising tool of emotion recognition.

In 2016, facial feature emotion recognition algorithms were among the new technologies, alongside high-definition CCTV, high resolution 3D face recognition and iris recognition, that found their way out of university research labs. In 2016, Facebook acquired FacioMetrics, a facial feature emotion recognition corporate spin-off by Carnegie Mellon University. In the same year Apple Inc. acquired the facial feature emotion recognition start-up Emotient. By the end of 2016, commercial vendors of facial recognition systems offered to integrate and deploy emotion recognition algorithms for facial features. The MIT&#x27;s Media Lab spin-off Affectiva by late 2019 offered a facial expression emotion detection product that can recognize emotions in humans while driving.

== Anti-facial recognition systems ==
The development of anti-facial recognition technology is effectively an arms race between privacy researchers and big data companies. Big data companies increasingly use convolutional AI technology to create ever more advanced facial recognition models. Solutions to block facial recognition may not work on newer software, or on different types of facial recognition models. One popular cited example of facial-recognition blocking is the CVDazzle makeup and haircut system, but the creators note on their website that it has been outdated for quite some time as it was designed to combat a particular facial recognition algorithm and may not work. Another example is the emergence of facial recognition that can identify people wearing facemasks and sunglasses, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Given that big data companies have much more funding than privacy researchers, it is very difficult for anti-facial recognition systems to keep up. There is also no guarantee that obfuscation techniques that were used for images taken in the past and stored, such as masks or software obfuscation, would protect users from facial-recognition analysis of those images by future technology.

In January 2013, Japanese researchers from the National Institute of Informatics created &#x27;privacy visor&#x27; glasses that use nearly infrared light to make the face underneath it unrecognizable to face recognition software that use infrared. The latest version uses a titanium frame, light-reflective material and a mask which uses angles and patterns to disrupt facial recognition technology through both absorbing and bouncing back light sources. However, these methods are used to prevent infrared facial recognition and would not work on AI facial recognition of plain images. Some projects use adversarial machine learning to come up with new printed patterns that confuse existing face recognition software.

One method that may work to protect from facial recognition systems are specific haircuts and make-up patterns that prevent the used algorithms to detect a face, known as computer vision dazzle. Incidentally, the makeup styles popular with Juggalos may also protect against facial recognition.

Facial masks that are worn to protect from contagious viruses can reduce the accuracy of facial recognition systems. A 2020 NIST study, tested popular one-to-one matching systems and found a failure rate between five and fifty percent on masked individuals. &quot;The Verge&quot; speculated that the accuracy rate of mass surveillance systems, which were not included in the study, would be even less accurate than the accuracy of one-to-one matching systems. The facial recognition of Apple Pay can work through many barriers, including heavy makeup, thick beards and even sunglasses, but fails with masks. However, facial recognition of masked faces is increasingly getting more reliable.

Another solution is the application of obfuscation to images that may fool facial recognition systems while still appearing normal to a human user. These could be used for when images are posted online or on social media. However, as it is hard to remove images once they are on the internet, the obfuscation on these images may be defeated and the face of the user identified by future advances in technology. Two examples of this technique, developed in 2020, are the ANU&#x27;s &#x27;Camera Adversaria&#x27; camera app, and the University of Chicago&#x27;s Fawkes image cloaking software algorithm which applies obfuscation to already taken photos. However, by 2021 the Fawkes obfuscation algorithm had already been specifically targeted by Microsoft Azure which changed its algorithm to lower Fawkes&#x27; effectiveness.

<text>In Jewish folklore, Broxa is a bird that is said to suck the milk of goats and sometimes human blood during the night.

In medieval Portugal, the Broxa was considered to be a shape shifting entity-as a witch in female form and in male form, a demon. It has been speculated that this creature was derived from the Jewish mythical creature.

<doc id="602406" wikidata="Q2293179" url="?curid=602406" title="Onela">
<text>Onela was, according to &quot;Beowulf&quot;, a Swedish king, the son of Ongentheow and the brother of Ohthere. He usurped the Swedish throne, but was killed by his nephew Eadgils, who won by hiring foreign assistance.

In Scandinavian sagas a Norwegian king by the same name exists, Áli (the Old Norse form of &quot;Onela&quot;, also rendered as &quot;Ole&quot;, &quot;Åle&quot; or &quot;Ale&quot;), who had the cognomen (&quot;from Oppland&quot;).

== Etymology ==
The name stems from the Proto-Norse &quot;Anulā&quot;, attested on the spear shaft SJy 68 from Nydam Mose. It is a diminutive with l-suffix to a name starting with *&quot;anu-&quot;, or directly of an appellative , &quot;ancestor&quot;.

== Beowulf ==
In the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Onela plays a central part in the Swedish-Geatish wars. Onela and his brother Ohthere were the sons of the Swedish king Ongenþeow. When the Geatish king Hreðel died, Onela and Ohthere saw the opportunity to pillage in Geatland starting the Swedish-Geatish wars:

The war ended with Ongenþeow&#x27;s death.

It is implied by the poem that Onela eventually became king, because Ohthere&#x27;s two sons, Eanmund and Eadgils, had to seek refuge with Heardred, Hygelac&#x27;s successor as king of the Geats. This caused Onela to attack the Geats. During the battle, Eanmund was killed by Onela&#x27;s champion Weohstan and Heardred was killed as well, after which Onela returned home.

Eadgils, however, survived and later, Beowulf helped him avenge Eanmund by slaying Onela.

By a conjectural emendation of line 62 of this poem some editors represent Onela as the son-in-law of Healfdene/Halfdan king of Denmark.

== Norse sagas ==
The animosity between Eadgils and Onela also appears in Scandinavian tradition. In the Norse sagas, which were mostly based on Norwegian versions of Scandinavian legends, Onela seems to appear as &quot;Áli of Uppland&quot;, and is called Norwegian. By the time &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; was used as a source by Snorri Sturluson, there appears no longer to have been a Scandinavian tradition of Áli as a relation of Eadgils.

The earliest extant Scandinavian source where Onela appears is the 9th century skaldic poem &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, Eadgils (&quot;Aðils&quot;) is called Onela&#x27;s enemy (). &quot;Ála&quot; is the genitive case of &quot;Áli&quot;, the Old Norse form of the name Onela.

In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, compiled by Snorri Sturluson and in Arngrímur Jónsson&#x27;s Latin summary of &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;, the battle hinted at in &quot;Beowulf&quot; is treated in more detail.

Snorri first quotes the &quot;Kálfsvísa&quot; but only small parts of it:
Snorri then relates that Aðils was in war with a Norwegian king named Áli, and they fought in the Battle on the Ice of Lake Vänern. Aðils was married to Yrsa, the mother of Hrólfr (Hroðulf) and so sent an embassy to Hrólfr asking him for help against Áli. He would receive three valuable gifts in recompense. Hrólfr was involved in a war against the Saxons and could not come in person but sent his twelve berserkers, including Bödvar Bjarki. Áli died in the war, and Aðils took Áli&#x27;s helmet &quot;Battle-boar&quot; and his horse Raven. The berserkers demanded three pounds of gold each in pay, and they demanded to choose the gifts that Aðils had promised Hrólfr, that is the two pieces of armour that nothing could pierce: the helmet battle-boar and the mailcoat &quot;Finn&#x27;s heritage&quot;. They also wanted the famous ring Svíagris. Aðils considered the pay outrageous and refused.

In the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, Snorri relates that king Eadgils fought hard battles with the Norwegian king who was called . They fought on the ice of Lake Vänern, where Áli fell and Adils won. Snorri relates that much is told about this event in the &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot;, and that Adils took Hrafn (Raven), Áli&#x27;s horse.

The &quot;Saga of the Skjöldungs&quot; is lost but in the end of the 16th century, Arngrímur Jónsson saved a piece of information from this saga in Latin. He wrote: &quot;There was animosity between king Adils of Sweden and the Norwegian king Áli of Uppland. They decided to fight on the ice of Lake Vänern. Adils won and took his helmet, chainmail and horse.

<text>Forensic linguistics, legal linguistics, or language and the law is the application of linguistic knowledge, methods, and insights to the forensic context of law, language, crime investigation, trial, and judicial procedure. It is a branch of applied linguistics.

Forensic linguistics is an umbrella term covering many applications to legal contexts. These are often split between written and spoken items. It is common for forensic linguistics to refer only to written text, whereas anything involving samples of speech is known as forensic speech science. 

There are principally three areas of application for linguists working on written texts in forensic contexts:
* understanding language of the written law,
* understanding language use in forensic and judicial processes, and
* the provision of linguistic evidence.

Forensic speech science also has many different applications:
* speaker comparison
* disputed utterance analysis
* voice parades
* speaker profiling
* audio enhancement and authentication

The discipline of forensic linguistics is not homogeneous; it involves a range of experts and researchers in different areas of the field.

==History==

The term &quot;forensic linguistics&quot; first appeared in 1968 when Jan Svartvik, a Swedish professor of linguistics, used it in &quot;The Evans Statements: A Case for Forensic Linguistics&quot; an analysis of statements by Timothy John Evans. It was in regard to re-analyzing the statements given to police at Notting Hill police station, England, in the case of an alleged murder by Evans in 1949. Evans was suspected of murdering his wife and baby, and he was tried and hanged for the crime. Yet, when Svartvik studied the statements allegedly given by Evans, he found that there were different stylistic markers involved, and Evans did not actually give the statements to the police officers as had been stated at the trial. Sparked by this case, forensic linguists in the UK at the time were focused on questioning the validity of police interrogations. As seen in numerous famous cases (e.g. the convictions of Derek Bentley, the Guildford Four, the Bridgewater Three), many of the major concerns were of the statements police officers used. Numerous times, the topic of &quot;police register&quot; came up– the type of stylist language and vocabulary used by members of the law enforcement when transcribing witness statements.

In the US, forensic linguistics can be traced back as early as 1927 to a ransom note in Corning, New York. The Associated Press reported, &quot;Duncan McLure, of Johnson City, uncle of the [kidnapped] girl, is the only member of the family to spell his name &#x27;McLure&#x27; instead of &#x27;McClure&#x27;. The letter he received, supposedly from the kidnappers, was addressed to him by the proper name, indicating that the writer was familiar with the difference in spelling.&quot; Other work of forensic linguistics in the United States concerned the rights of individuals with regard to understanding their Miranda rights during the interrogation process. The 1963 case of Ernesto Miranda was pivotal to the beginning of the forensic linguistics field. His case led to the creation of the Miranda rights and pushed the focus of forensic linguistics on witness questioning rather than police statements. Various cases came about that challenged whether or not suspects truly understood what their rights meant– leading to a distinction of coercive versus voluntary interrogations. An early application of forensic linguistics in the United States was related to the status of trademarks as words or phrases in the language. One of the bigger cases involved fast food giant McDonald&#x27;s claiming that it had originated the process of attaching unprotected words to the &quot;Mc&quot; prefix (referred to as McWords) and was unhappy with Quality Inns International&#x27;s intention of opening a chain of economy hotels to be called &quot;McSleep&quot;.

In the 1980s, Australian linguists discussed the application of linguistics and sociolinguistics to legal issues. They discovered that a phrase such as &quot;the same language&quot; is open to interpretation. Aboriginal people have their own understanding and use of &quot;English&quot;, something that is not always appreciated by speakers of the dominant version of English, i.e. &quot;white English&quot;. The Aboriginal people also bring their own culturally-based interactional styles to the interview.

The 2000s saw a considerable shift in the field of forensic linguistics, which has been described as a coming-of-age of the discipline, as it spread to many countries around the world, from Europe to Australia and Japan. Today, not only does the field have professional associations such as the International Association for Forensic Phonetics and Acoustics (IAFPA) founded in 1991 as the International Association for Forensic Phonetics (IAFP), the International Association for Forensic and Legal Linguistics (IAFLL), founded as the International Association of Forensic Linguists (IAFL) in 1993, and the Austrian Association for Legal Linguistics (AALL), founded in 2017, but it can now provide the scientific community with a range of textbooks such as Coulthard, Johnson and Wright (2017), Gibbons (2003), and Olsson (2008).

Additionally, certain leading institutions have developed programs of study and institutes focused on forensic linguistics. In the United States, Hofstra University has developed a master&#x27;s degree program, and the Institute for Forensic Linguistics, Threat Assessment, and Strategic Analysis, which conducts special projects, research, and internships in forensic linguistics. This institute contains the Forensic Linguistics Capital Case Innocence Project, formed in 2014, which involves supervised interns reanalyzing language data in capital punishment cases to locate any possibilities of appeal. In the United Kingdom, Aston University has developed master&#x27;s degree and Ph.D. programs as well as the Aston Institute for Forensic Linguistics (AIFL), founded in 2019 and formerly known as the Aston Centre for Forensic Linguistics which was founded in 2008, that studies forensic texts and conducts research using a variety of methods from numerous areas of linguistics. The University of York  also provides a master&#x27;s degree and Ph.D. programmes in forensic speech science.

==Areas of study==
The range of topics within forensic linguistics is diverse, but research occurs in the following areas:

===The language of legal texts===

Communication problems may occur between the written law and lay persons due to the complex nature of the language and vocabulary used in these legal texts. Forensic linguists will study these texts to understand how these issues arise, and if necessary, provide explanations or translations of the contents.

One area of the language of legal texts encompasses the Miranda warning in the United States. These warnings let the defendant know that they have the right to be silent, since whatever they say from the moment they are in police custody can and will be used against them in a court of law. The recipients who are advised of these rights must have a certain level of competency in the English language in order to completely understand the warning.

===The language of legal processes===
Among other things, this area examines language as it is used in cross-examination, evidence presentation, judge&#x27;s direction, police cautions, police testimonies in court, summing up to a jury, interview techniques, the questioning process in court, and in other areas such as police interviews.

Police officers use specific language to elicit certain responses from civilians. Because of a police officer&#x27;s social stature, and the way they often phrase &quot;requests&quot; as &quot;commands&quot;, people may be confused as to what their rights are when they are being questioned by police. Officers use linguistic tactics including putting the blame onto the victim and asking questions with ambiguous phrasing to elicit specific responses from people.
In addition, language structure in witness or suspect interviews can have an impact on the statements which are made from these. In the case of Derek Bentley, elicitation of a narrative through questions rather than a natural account resulted in a wrongful prosecution and sentence of the death penalty. Analysis of the statement revealed the statement was not Bentley&#x27;s own words and was constructed by the police officers.

When a victim is invoking their right to a lawyer, there are directions stating that the request may not come off as ambiguous. In fact, if the request is not stated in a way that the officer deems to be clear, the victim may not receive their request for counsel at all.

During the examination process, language plays a substantial role in the presentation of a story to the courtroom. A defendant&#x27;s ambiguity may be deemed unacceptable. The language used by the lawyer to construct the story to the courtroom elicits specific responses from the witness, and specific emotions from the jury. For example, in an instance where a lawyer is examining a hostile witness, they will often use language to limit the response of the witness, in order to avoid having the witness present conflicting evidence. In this instance, yes/no questions will be targeted, and questions with room for elaboration, such as wh-formation questions, will likely be avoided. In a situation where a lawyer interviews a friendly witness whose testimony could potentially strengthen the story constructed by the lawyer, the opposite may occur, where wh-questions are targeted to allow for elaboration.

Lawyers employ specific tactics for both themselves and their witnesses to come off as more or less truthful to the jury and the people of the courtroom. For example, the lawyer may refer to the witness by their first name or a nickname to humanize the witness, or they may speak using slang in order to create less social distance between themselves and the courtroom. The lawyer may also avoid using slang, and instead use complicated law terminology to set themselves apart from the courtroom and define their status.

The lawyer works in constructing the language of the legal process of the courtroom, and specific witnesses may respond to the lawyer&#x27;s questions in different ways, eliciting new language tactics and opinions from the jury. For example, witnesses may use direct or indirect speech based on their previous societal experiences, gender differences, socioeconomic differences, or differences in education level. Using particular dialects, slang, or sentence formations could assist in making the witness more or less truthful to the jury.

Since language can be used to elicit responses in the legal process, the right to an interpreter plays a part in the fairness of the trial. &quot;The right to an interpreter is essentially a procedural right that derives from the right to a fair trial: everyone charged with a criminal offence has the right to certain minimum procedural guarantees, and these include the right to the free assistance of an interpreter where s/he cannot understand or speak the language of the concerned court.&quot;

==Forensic text types==

===Emergency call===
In an emergency call, the recipient or emergency operator&#x27;s ability to extract primarily linguistic information in threatening situations and to come up with the required response in a timely manner is crucial to the successful completion of the call. Emphasis on intonation, voice pitch, and the extent to which there is cooperation between the caller and the recipient at any one time are also very important in analyzing an emergency call. Full cooperation includes frank and timely responses.

Urgency plays a role in emergency calls, so hesitations, signs of evasiveness, and incomplete or overly short answers indicate that the caller might be making a false or hoax call. A genuine call has distinctive interlocking and slight overlap of turns. The recipient trusts the caller to provide accurate information and the caller trusts the recipient to ask only pertinent questions. If the caller uses a rising pitch at the end of every turn, it might represent a lack of commitment; the recipient&#x27;s use of a rising pitch indicates doubt or desire for clarification. The call ideally moves from nil knowledge on the part of the recipient to a maximum amount of knowledge in a minimum possible period of time. This makes the emergency call unlike any other kind of service encounter.

===Ransom demands or other threat communication===
Threat is a counterpart of a promise and is an important feature in a ransom demand. Ransom demands are also examined to identify between genuine and false threats. An example of a ransom note analysis can be seen in the case of the Lindbergh kidnapping, where the first ransom note (sometimes referred to as the Nursery Note) stated: &quot;We warn you for making anyding public or for notify the Polise the child is in gut care&quot;. In the sentence, the kidnapper makes the claim that the child is in good hands, but to make such a claim, the note would have to have been written before the perpetrator entered the premises. Therefore, the claim is false (at the time of writing) since the kidnapper had not even encountered the child when he wrote the note.

Kidnappers may write statements that later end up being true, such as &quot;your child is being held in a private location&quot; being written ahead of time.

Ransom demands in the style of written notes have been present in many notable cases. The style of writing used in a ransom note is examined by forensic linguists in order to determine the writing&#x27;s true intent, as well as to determine who wrote the note. Forensic linguists look at factors such as syntactic structures, stylistic patterns, punctuation, and even spelling while analyzing ransom notes. In the case of the Lindbergh ransom note, forensic linguists compared similarities of writing styles from the note to that of writing of the suspect, creating a better chance at discovering who wrote the note.

Bomb threats are another form of threat communication. It is the Forensic Linguists job to determine the validity of the statement and if the note has been tampered with. Linguists often work with other interrelated fields such as cyber analysts if the threat is made through text or an internet forum to test for validity or alterations.

===Suicide letters===

A suicide note is typically brief, concise, and highly propositional with a degree of evasiveness. A credible suicide letter must be making a definite unequivocal proposition in a situational context. The proposition of genuine suicide is thematic, directed to the addressee (or addressees), and relevant to the relationship between them and the writer. Suicide notes generally have sentences alluding to the act of killing oneself, or the method of suicide that was undertaken. The contents of a suicide note could be intended to make the addressee suffer or feel guilt. Genuine suicide letters are short, typically less than 300 words in length. Extraneous or irrelevant material is often excluded from the text.

===Death row statements===
Death row statements either admit the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of honesty and forthrightness, or deny the crime, leaving the witness with an impression of innocence. They may also denounce witnesses as dishonest, critique law enforcement as corrupt in an attempt to portray innocence, or seek an element of revenge in their last moments. Death row statements are made within the heavily institutionalized setting of death row prisons.

The Forensic Linguistics Institute holds a corpus of these documents and is conducting research on them.

===Social media===
Social media statements are often context-specific, and their interpretation can be highly subjective. Forensic application of a selection of stylistic and stylometric techniques has been done in a simulated authorship attribution case involving texts in relation to Facebook. Analysis of social media postings can reveal whether they are illegal (e.g. sex trade) or unethical (e.g. intended to harm) or whether they are not (e.g. simply provocative or free speech).

==Use of linguistic evidence in legal proceedings==
These areas of application have varying degrees of acceptability or reliability within the field. Linguists have provided evidence in:
* Trademark and other intellectual property disputes
* Disputes of meaning and use
* Author identification (determining who wrote an anonymous text by making comparisons to known writing samples of a suspect; such as threat letters, mobile phone texts or emails)
* Forensic stylistics (identifying cases of plagiarism)
* Voice identification, also known as forensic phonetics (used to determine, through acoustic qualities, if the voice on a tape recorder is that of the defendant)
* Discourse analysis (the analysis of the structure of written or spoken utterance to determine who is introducing topics or whether a suspect is agreeing to engage in criminal conspiracy)
* Language analysis (forensic dialectology) tracing the linguistic history of asylum seekers (Language Analysis for the Determination of Origin)
* Reconstruction of mobile phone text conversations
* Forensic phonetics

Specialist databases of samples of spoken and written natural language (called corpora) are now frequently used by forensic linguists. These include corpora of suicide notes, mobile phone texts, police statements, police interview records, and witness statements. They are used to analyze language, understand how it is used, and to reduce the effort needed to identify words that tend to occur near each other (collocations or collocates).

===Author identification===

The identification of whether a given individual said or wrote something relies on analysis of their idiolect, or particular patterns of language use (vocabulary, collocations, pronunciation, spelling, grammar, etc.). The idiolect is a theoretical construct based on the idea that there is linguistic variation at the group level and hence there may also be linguistic variation at the individual level. William Labov has stated that nobody has found a &quot;homogenous data&quot; in idiolects, and there are many reasons why it is difficult to provide such evidence.

Firstly, language is not an inherited property, but one which is socially acquired. Because acquisition is continuous and life-long, an individual&#x27;s use of language is always susceptible to variation from a variety of sources, including other speakers, the media, and macro-social changes. Education can have a profoundly homogenizing effect on language use. Research into authorship identification is ongoing. The term authorship attribution is now felt to be too deterministic.

The paucity of documents (ransom notes, threatening letters, etc.) in most criminal cases in a forensic setting means there is often too little text upon which to base a reliable identification. However, the information provided may be adequate to eliminate a suspect as an author or narrow down an author from a small group of suspects.

Authorship measures that analysts use include word length average, average number of syllables per word, article frequency, type-token ratio, punctuation (both in terms of overall density and syntactic boundaries), and the measurements of hapax legomena (unique words in a text). Statistical approaches include factor analysis, Bayesian statistics, Poisson distribution, multivariate analysis, and discriminant function analysis of function words.

The CUSUM (cumulative sum) method for text analysis has also been developed. CUSUM analysis works even on short texts and relies on the assumption that each speaker has a unique set of habits, thus rendering no significant difference between their speech and writing. Speakers tend to utilize two- to three-letter words in a sentence and their utterances tend to include vowel-initial words.

In order to carry out the CUSUM test on habits of utilizing two- to three-letter words and vowel-initial words in a sentential clause, the occurrences of each type of word in the text must be identified and the distribution plotted in each sentence. The CUSUM distribution for these two habits will be compared with the average sentence length of the text. The two sets of values should track each other. Any altered section of the text would show a distinct discrepancy between the values of the two reference points. The tampered-with section will exhibit a different pattern from the rest of the text.

===Forensic stylistics===
This category focuses on more written and spoken evidence where the examiner will determine the meaning, content, speaker identification, and determination of author to find the bases of the plagiarism.

One of the earliest cases where forensic stylistics was used to detect plagiarism was the case of Helen Keller&#x27;s short story &quot;The Frost King&quot;, in which the deaf-blind American author was accused of plagiarism in 1892. An investigation revealed that &quot;The Frost King&quot; had been plagiarized from Margaret Canby&#x27;s &quot;Frost Fairies&quot;, which had been read to Keller some time earlier. Keller was found to have made only minute changes to common words and phrases and used less common words to say the same thing, suggesting mere alterations to original ideas. Keller used &quot;vast wealth&quot; instead of &quot;treasure&quot; (230 times less common in the language), &quot;bethought&quot; instead of &quot;concluded&quot; (approximately 450 times less common), and &quot;bade them&quot; instead of &quot;told them&quot; (approximately 30 times less common). Keller used the phrase &quot;ever since that time&quot;, but Canby chose &quot;from that time&quot; (the latter 50 times more common than the former). Keller also used &quot;I cannot imagine&quot;, but Canby used &quot;I do not know&quot;. &quot;Know&quot; is approximately ten times more common than &quot;imagine&quot;. Keller relied on a lexis that is less common than that of Canby. The Flesch and Flesch–Kincaid readability test showed that Canby&#x27;s text had more originality than Keller&#x27;s. Canby&#x27;s text obtained a higher grade on the reading ease scale compared to Keller&#x27;s. The distinctions between Keller and Canby&#x27;s text are at the lexical and phrasal level.

Other examples of plagiarism include the cases between Richard Condon, author of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, and English novelist Robert Graves and between Martin Luther King Jr. and Archibald Carey. Judging by the text in &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, Condon&#x27;s work is rich in clichés such as &quot;in his superstitious heart of hearts&quot;. While Helen Keller took pride in using rare phrases and avoided common source words, Condon was fond of expanding existing words into phrases and existing phrases into more extensive ones. Condon was also found to have borrowed from a wide range of Graves&#x27; work. However, in the plagiarism case between King and Archibald Carey, almost half of King&#x27;s doctoral dissertation was discovered to have been copied from another theology student. King simply changed the names of the mountains and used much more alliteration and assonance. Carey&#x27;s and Graves&#x27; texts (source texts) were noticeably shorter, pithier, and simpler in structure, while Condon&#x27;s and King&#x27;s texts relied on &quot;purple&quot; devices, extending the existing text and flourishing their language significantly.

Another famous example is that in the case of Ted Kaczynski, who was eventually convicted of being the &quot;Unabomber&quot;. Ted&#x27;s brother, David Kaczynski, recognized his writing style in the phrase &quot;cool-headed logicians&quot; in the published 35,000-word &quot;Industrial Society and Its Future&quot; (commonly called the &quot;Unabomber Manifesto&quot;) and notified the authorities. FBI agents searching Kaczynski&#x27;s hut found hundreds of documents written by Kaczynski but not published anywhere. An analysis produced by FBI Supervisory Special Agent James R. Fitzgerald identified numerous lexical items and phrases common to the two documents. Some were more distinctive than others, but the prosecution argued that even the more common words and phrases being used by Kaczynski became distinctive when used in combination with one another.

Forensic stylistics was used to analyze the texts of Jack the Ripper dating back to 1888. Jack the ripper’s first letter to the police was received on September 24, 1888. Its contents contained the details of the second murder of Annie Chapman, who was killed on September 8, 1888, and the letter was unsigned. The second text received on September 27 was the “Dear Boss” letter, which was signed “Jack the Ripper”. The third notable piece of writing was a postcard titled “Saucy Jacky” received on October 1, 1888. The postcard addressed the double murder of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes on September 30, 1888 and was also signed “Jack the Ripper”. The final important text was titled “Moab the Midian”, contained elements of a triple homicide, was justified by religious motives, and was received on October 5, 1888. These are the three most important texts regarding the Ripper case, according to forensic linguistic analysis. Jack the Ripper became very famous, very quickly, and people enjoyed writing in false letters on his behalf. These three letters were received before any publicity came to the case, and therefore are considered the most reliable. Linguists went on to analyze the texts claiming to be from the Ripper to determine whether or not they were written by the same person. A JRC (Jack the Ripper Corpus) was compiled with the 209 texts containing 17,643 words. The average length of one piece of text was 83 tokens, with the minimum being 7 and the maximum being 648. Looking at the addressee’s, 67% were to Scotland Yard or other law enforcement units, 20% were to common citizens, and 13% were to unknown addressees. The majority of the postmarks were from London, however some of them were from all over the United Kingdom. All of the letters were handwritten, and 4% contained drawings depicting items like knives and coffins. 75% of the letters were signed “Jack the Ripper” or “Jack the Whitechapel Ripper”, “JR”, or “jack ripper and son”. 14% used other pseudonyms like “Jim the Cutter” and “Bill the Bowler”. 11% were not signed. The dates of the 209 texts ranged from September 24, 1888 to October 14th, 1896, however 62% of the texts in the JRC were received during October through November 1888. The term “author clustering” refers to the process carried out in order to determine if a set of texts has the same author. The Ripper texts were too short to use current computation methods of author clustering and authorship identification, so the Jaccard coefficient and Jaccard deviation was used. The Jaccard coefficient is the number of shared features between both texts divided by the total number of features in both texts. This method is currently applied to text messages and short texts, like emails, newspaper articles, and personal narratives. In simpler terms, it does a plagiarism check, but hoping for a match. This analyzes for word n-grams, which are strings of words of a certain length (n). The more n-gram words in common, the more similarities between the two documents, the higher the likeliness they are not independent. The method of using word n-grams is called frequency-based stylometrics. Although this method is not as reliable as looking for function words, simple word frequencies, or character n-grams, word strings are rarer because combinations of words are at the core of language processing. They reveal idiolectal nature because every author subconsciously uses their own idiosyncratic set of lexical choices. For the JRC, they looked at the presence and absence of word n-grams instead of the frequency of word n-grams because the texts were so short. Because they’re using the presence and absence instead of the frequency, the Jaccard distance is used. This will provide a more inclusive answer consisting of major groups of texts that are more like each other, and then smaller groups can be examined after. The JRC was analyzed against a Comparison corpus consisting of the following: COHA, CLMET3, and EOBC. All of the JRC texts were compared to each other and the comparison corpora with a word n-gram of n=2, and a radial dendrogram was produced. From this, “Dear Boss” and “Saucy Jacky” were deemed the most similar with a Jaccard distance of 0.93. That degree of dissimilarity can be found in less than 5% of the texts in the JRC. Moab the Midian came in with the next most similarities. The final conclusion was that Dear Boss and Saucy Jacky cannot be considered independent from one another because they share more word 2-gram uses than 95% of all other possible pairs of texts in the JRC. Of the pre-publication texts, Moab the Midian is almost as close as Dear Boss is to Saucy Jacky and is the only text that is like both.

===Discourse analysis===
Discourse analysis deals with analyzing written, oral, or sign language use, or any significant semiotic event. According to the method, the close analysis of a covert recording can produce useful deductions. For instance, while an utterance like &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;uh-huh&quot; may indicate that the suspect understands a suggestion, it is not evidence of the suspect&#x27;s agreement to the suggestion.

===Linguistic dialectology===
This refers to the study of dialects in a methodological manner based on anthropological information. It is becoming more important to conduct systematic studies of dialects, especially within the English language, because they are no longer as distinct as they once were due to the onslaught of mass media and population mobility. Political and social issues have also caused languages to straddle geographical borders resulting in certain language varieties spoken in multiple countries, leading to complications when determining an individual&#x27;s origin by means of his/her language or dialect.

Dialectology was used during the investigations into the Yorkshire Ripper tape hoax.

===Forensic phonetics===
The forensic phonetician is concerned with the production of accurate transcriptions of what was being said. Transcriptions can reveal information about a speaker&#x27;s social and regional background. Forensic phonetics can determine similarities between the speakers of two or more separate recordings. Voice recording as a supplement to the transcription can be useful as it allows victims and witnesses to indicate whether the voice of a suspect is that of the accused, i.e. alleged, criminal.

A man accused of manufacturing the drug ecstasy was misheard by the police transcriber as &quot;hallucinogenic&quot;. The police transcriber heard &quot;but if it&#x27;s, as you say, it&#x27;s hallucinogenic, it&#x27;s in the Sigma catalogue&quot;. However, the actual utterance was &quot;but if it&#x27;s, as you say, it&#x27;s German, it&#x27;s in the Sigma catalogue&quot;.

Another disputed utterance was between a police officer and a suspect. One of the topics of conversation was a third man known as &quot;Ernie&quot;. The poor signal of the recording made &quot;Ernie&quot; sound like &quot;Ronnie&quot;. The surveillance tape presented acoustic problems: an intrusive electronic-sounding crackle, the sound of the car engine, the playing of the car radio, the movement of the target vehicle, and the intrusive noise all coincided with the first syllable of the disputed name.

Forensic speechreading is the complement of forensic voice identification. Transcripts of surveilled video records can sometimes allow expert speechreaders to identify speech content or style where the identity of the talker is apparent from the video record.

=== Ethics ===
There are three ethical rules that linguists are to follow when taking part in court proceedings. 

* The first rule is being a qualified expert witness. Strong academic credentials make it easier for the court and the jury to allow linguists to testify. When taking on cases Forensic Linguists are careful as it may be dangerous to pursue a case that the linguist cannot provide full expertise. 
* The second rule is to testify with truth. It is not the linguists job to prove innocence or guilt, that lies with the judge and jury. However, it is the linguist duty to provide linguistic truth. Their primary job is to help the judge and jury understand the evidence provided in a scientific way. 

* The third rule is to maintain composure throughout the examination. The linguist should be prepared for cross-examination. It is important for them to maintain neutrality and only provide scientific facts based on their expert knowledge. 

===Examples===
Evidence from forensic linguistics has more power to eliminate someone as a suspect than to prove him or her guilty. Linguistic expertise has been employed in criminal cases to defend an individual suspected of a crime and during government investigations. Forensic linguists have given expert evidence in a wide variety of cases, including abuse of process, where police statements were found to be too similar to have been independently produced by police officers; the authorship of hate mail; the authorship of letters to an Internet child pornography service; the contemporaneity of an arsonist&#x27;s diary; the comparison between a set of mobile phone texts and a suspect&#x27;s police interview, and the reconstruction of a mobile phone text conversation. Some well-known examples include an appeal against the conviction of Derek Bentley; the identification of Subcomandante Marcos, the Zapatistas&#x27; charismatic leader, by Max Appedole; and the identification of Ted Kaczynski as the so-called &quot;Unabomber&quot; by James R. Fitzgerald.

The criminal laboratories &quot;Bundeskriminalamt&quot; (in Germany) and the &quot;Nederlands Forensisch Instituut&quot; (in the Netherlands) both employ forensic linguists.

Forensic linguistics contributed to the overturning of Derek Bentley&#x27;s conviction for murder in 1998, although there were other non-linguistic issues. Nineteen-year-old Bentley, who was functionally illiterate, had been hanged in 1953 for his part in the murder of PC Sidney Miles; he had been convicted partly on the basis of his statement to police, allegedly transcribed verbatim from a spoken monologue. When the case was reopened, a forensic linguist found that the frequency and usage of the word &quot;then&quot; in police transcripts suggested the transcripts were not verbatim statements but had been partially authored by police interviewers; this and other evidence led to Bentley&#x27;s posthumous pardon.

During the investigative stage in identifying Subcomandante Marcos, the Mexican government speculated that he was a dangerous guerrilla fighter. This theory gained much traction at the end of 1994, after the dissident Zapatista Comandante, Salvador Morales Garibay, gave away the identity of his former fellow Zapatistas to the Mexican government, among them Marcos&#x27; identity. They all were indicted for terrorism, arrest warrants were issued, and arrests were made in a military action. The Mexican government alleges some Zapatistas to be terrorists, among them Marcos. There was a storm of political pressures claiming for a fast military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On 9 February 1995, in a televised special presidential broadcast, President Ernesto Zedillo announced Subcomandante Marcos to be one Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente, born 19 June 1957 to Spanish immigrants in Tampico, Tamaulipas, a former professor at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana School of Sciences and Arts for the Design.

After the government revealed Marcos&#x27; identity in January 1995, Max Appedole, old friend, classmate with the Jesuits at the Instituto Cultural Tampico, made direct intervention in the conflict. Appedole played a major role with the Mexican government to avoid a military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis by demonstrating that, contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo, Rafael Guillén was no terrorist. Max Appedole identified Marcos&#x27; linguistic fingerprint, based on Marcos&#x27; specific, unique way of speaking, recognized his literary style in all Marcos&#x27; manifestos that were published in the media, and linked them to literary tournaments organized by the Jesuits in which they competed in Mexico. Everyone has an idiolect, encompassing vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, that differs from the way other people talk. He confirmed that he had no doubt that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guillén, a pacifist. Max Appedole closed the first successful linguistic profiling confirmation case in the history of law enforcement. Based on these achievements, a new science was developed, giving way to what is now called forensic linguistics. This motivated a new division of forensic linguistics called &quot;criminal profiling in law enforcement&quot;.

Forensic linguistic evidence also played a role in the investigation of the 2005 disappearance of Julie Turner, a 40-year-old woman living in Yorkshire. After she was reported missing, her partner received several text messages from Julie&#x27;s mobile phone, such as &quot;Stopping at jills, back later need to sort my head out&quot;, and &quot;Tell kids not to worry. sorting my life out. be in touch to get some things&quot;. Investigators found that letters written by Turner&#x27;s friend Howard Simmerson shared linguistic similarities with the text messages, suggesting that Simmerson had been aware of the contents of the messages. Simmerson was eventually found guilty of Turner&#x27;s murder.

19-year-old Jenny Nicholl disappeared on 30 June 2005. Her body was never found, giving police and forensic scientists little information to go on about what might have happened to Jenny. After looking through her phone for clues, forensic linguists came to the conclusion that the texts sent from her phone around the time that she disappeared seemed very different from her usual texting style, and soon started looking to her ex-boyfriend, David Hodgson, for clues of what happened to her, including looking through his phone and studying his texting style. The forensic linguists found a number of stylistic similarities between David&#x27;s texting style and the messages sent from Jenny&#x27;s phone around the time she went missing. Using the timeframe of when she went missing, combined with the differences in texting styles and other forensic details, Jenny&#x27;s murderer, David Hodgson, was convicted. The analysis of the text messages and their submission in court helped to pave the way for forensic linguistics to be acknowledged as a science in UK law, rather than opinion. To this day, her body has not been found, but justice was still served for her and her family because of forensic linguistics.

Forensic linguist John Olsson gave evidence in a murder trial on the meaning of &quot;jooking&quot; in connection with a stabbing.

During the appeal against the conviction of the Bridgewater Four, the forensic linguist examined the written confession of Patrick Molloy, one of the defendants – a confession which he had retracted immediately – and a written record of an interview which the police claimed took place immediately before the confession was dictated. Molloy denied that the interview had ever taken place, and the analysis indicated that the answers in the interview were not consistent with the questions being asked. The linguist came to the conclusion that the interview had been fabricated by police. The conviction against the Bridgewater Four was quashed before the linguist in the case, Malcolm Coulthard, could produce his evidence.

In an Australian case reported by Eagleson, a &quot;farewell letter&quot; had apparently been written by a woman prior to her disappearance. The letter was compared with a sample of her previous writing and that of her husband. Eagleson came to the conclusion that the letter had been written by the husband of the missing woman, who subsequently confessed to having written it and to having killed his wife. The features analyzed included sentence breaks, marked themes, and deletion of prepositions.

In 2009, there was a house fire where a father was able to save his children, but his wife died in the house. The police thought that the fire was actually not an accident, but instead a cover-up of the father murdering the mother. The forensic linguists were able to obtain the phones of both the father and mother, and realized that there were texts still being sent from the mother&#x27;s phone the whole day– long after the police thought she had died. Using information from the two phones, the linguists were able to study the texting styles of both parents to see if they could obtain any more information about what happened that day. It turned out that the texts sent from the wife&#x27;s phone were actually the husband pretending to be the wife so that no one would know she was murdered, and everyone would believe that she perished in the house fire. The forensic linguists were able to figure this out by studying the husband&#x27;s texting style, spelling errors, and more, and were able to come to the conclusion that the texts sent after the wife was thought to be deceased were actually the husband texting from her phone pretending to be her. Without this knowledge, it would have been much more difficult to convict the husband of murder and get justice for the family.

==Additional concepts==

===Linguistic fingerprinting===
A linguistic fingerprint is a concept put forward by some scholars that each human being uses language differently, and that this difference between people involves a collection of markers which stamps a speaker/writer as unique, similar to a fingerprint. Under this view, it is assumed that every individual uses languages differently and this difference can be observed as a fingerprint. It is formed as a result of merged language style. A person&#x27;s linguistic fingerprint can be reconstructed from the individual&#x27;s daily interactions and relate to a variety of self-reported personality characteristics, situational variables, and physiological markers (e.g. blood pressure, cortisol, testosterone). In the process of an investigation, the emphasis should be on the relative rather than absolute difference between the authors and how investigators can classify their texts. John Olsson, however, argues that although the concept of linguistic fingerprinting is attractive to law enforcement agencies, there is so far little hard evidence to support the notion.

===Variation===
Intra-author variations are the ways in which one author&#x27;s texts differ from each other. Inter-author variations are the ways in which different authors&#x27; writing varies. Two texts by one author do not necessarily vary less than texts by two different authors.
*Genre: When texts are being measured in different genres, considerable variation is observed even though they are by the same author.
*Text Type: Personal letters contain more inter-relationship bonding strategies than academic articles or term papers.
*Fiction vs. Non-Fiction: Some fiction writers are journalists. Due to the different demands of each medium, they can be completely different from one another and this results in intra-author variation.
*Private vs. Public: A politician writing a political speech, which is a public text, will differ greatly from a private text to a friend or family member.
*Time lapse: The greater the time lapse between two works, the greater the likely variation. Language changes more than we realize in a relatively short span of time, influencing our susceptibility to language changes around us.
*Disguise: A writer can publish pseudonymously or anonymously, disguising output to prevent recognition.

===Forensic transcription===
The two main types of transcriptions are written documents and video and audio records. Accurate, reliable text transcription is important because the text is the data which becomes the available evidence. If a transcription is wrong, the evidence is altered. If there is failure to transcribe the full text, evidence is once again altered unwittingly. There must be emphasis on the text being the evidence. A transcription of an audio file should never be assumed to be completely accurate. Each type of transcription contains its own problems. A handwritten document might contain unusual spellings which may result in ambiguous meanings, illegible handwriting, and illustrations that are difficult to comprehend. A scanned document is tricky, as scanning may alter the original document. Audio and video documents can include repetitions, hesitation, nonsensical talk, jargon which can be hard to understand, and speakers mumbling incoherently and inaudibly. Non-linguistic sounds such as crying and laughing may also be included in the audio and video text which cannot be transcribed easily. Because of this, civil libertarians have argued that interrogations in major criminal cases should be recorded and the recordings kept, as well as transcribed.

=== Digital Communication ===
Digital communicative texts, such as social media posts or text messages, typically display features which are not seen in traditional linguistics. Individuals may employ a variety of methods to convey paralanguage in order to better communicate tone of voice, volume, and expression, such as using capital letters to portray shouting.

With the rise of digital communication, the world has also seen an increase in the use of emoji and emoticons, which are often used to replace non-verbal gestures or facial expressions. The use of emoji and emoticons for authorship identification is still a relatively new idea in forensic linguistics.

<text>The Citroën LN (Hélène) and Citroën LNA (Hélèna) are front-engine, front-drive, three-door, four passenger hatchback city cars manufactured and marketed by Citroën from 1976 to 1986 over a single generation — as a badge engineered variant of the Peugeot 104, introduced shortly after the takeover of Citroën by Peugeot.

The added &quot;A&quot; used in the name of the bigger engined LNA stood for &quot;Athlétique&quot; (Athletic).
Its noise figure is 69 decibels.

==Citroën LN (1976–1978)==
The LN was introduced in July 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAM77/78&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It combined the bodyshell of the Peugeot 104 Z (a shortened floorpan version of the 104) with the economical 602 cc two-cylinder gasoline engine of the Citroën 2CV. Equipment levels were low, but the LN&#x27;s key selling points were its low price and running costs.
Strongly resembling the Peugeot it was based on, the LN was assembled at a Citroën plant and fitted with a Citroën engine. Peugeot had recently acquired Citroën and the LN stood in stark contrast to assurances that the two marques would retain their individuality. When pressed, Citroën explained that the LN project had been rushed through because of &quot;the need to supply customers and the [dealership] network with a model to strengthen Citroën&#x27;s position at the lower end of the market,&quot; hardly a ringing endorsement. The Citroën range included the Ami and the Dyane as well as the venerable 2CV which would continue in production well after the others. Citroën made it clear that this would not happen again, which remained largely true until the Citroën Saxo, which was a badge engineered variant of the Peugeot 106 (itself developed from the Citroen AX platform).

==Citroën LNA (1978–1986)==
Citroën marketed the LN mainly in Southern Europe and neighbouring countries, and a more powerful replacement, the LNA, was introduced on 6 November 1978 and was exported to much of the rest of Europe (including right-hand drive versions for Great Britain, where it was not launched until early 1983). It had the more powerful and modern 652 cc two-cylinder engine of the Citroën Visa with electronic ignition. In December 1982 a 1.1 L four-cylinder engine was added which had a top speed of nearly 90 mph (145 km/h) for the LNA 11E and 11RE, which spelled the end of the two-cylinder models in many markets. But like the smaller-engined LN, the LNA was cheap to buy and cheap to run. For Italy and France only, there was also an intermediate version called the LNA 10E, with a 954 cc Peugeot engine.

By 1980 a variant of the LNA could was marketed in France as the &quot;LNA Entreprise&quot;, with the back seat removed. This was effectively a function of taxation rules, whereby the two-seater car could be sold with a reduced rate of value-added tax.
After the LNA&#x27;s launch, it spawned another badge engineered variant, the Talbot Samba, featuring square headlights and a different, slightly longer, rear body section. The mechanicals and a developed version of the full length 104 floorpan were used in the Citroën Visa that was also launched in 1978. 1983 cars arrived early, in July 1982, and benefited from new molded black plastic bumpers, a new decoration for the C-pillar, a newly positioned rubber side-strip, new larger rear lights on a black-painted rear panel, blacked out chrome window trim, and more elaborately styled wheels which were shared with the manufacturer&#x27;s Visa Super E. The interior was also improved (with a parcel shelf, for instance) and the folding rear seat was now split. In July 1985 Citroën introduced cars for the 1986 model year. The previously black grill and bumpers were now coloured grey, although LNA production ceased in the summer of 1986, around the same time as the Talbot Samba. Its successor, the Citroën AX, was launched shortly afterwards.

It was not launched onto the British market until early 1983, where the most popular entry-level small cars were the Austin Metro and Ford Fiesta. It also reached the UK market during the same year as the Fiat Uno, Nissan Micra, Peugeot 205 and Vauxhall Nova, but failed to prove anywhere near as popular as any of these cars and was withdrawn from sale there after just two years.

The Peugeot 104 remained in production until 1988 even though its popular successor, the 205, had been launched five years earlier, as an entry-level model in some markets. The Visa also lasted until 1988. The Visa-based box van Citroën C15 version was the longest lasting 104 derivative, using 205 and 206 mechanicals it was made until 2005.

<text>Hermann Hupfeld (31 March 1796 – 24 April 1866) was a Protestant German Orientalist and Biblical commentator. He is known for his historical-critical studies of the Old Testament.

He was born at Marburg, where he studied philosophy and theology from 1813 to 1817. In 1819 he became a teacher in the gymnasium at Hanau, but in 1822 resigned that appointment. After studying for some time at Halle, he in 1824 settled as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in philosophy at that university, and in the following year was appointed extraordinary professor of theology at Marburg. There he received professorships of theology and Oriental languages in 1825 and 1827 respectively. Sixteen years later he returned to Halle as a successor of Wilhelm Gesenius.

In 1865 he was accused by some theologians of the Hengstenberg school of heretical doctrines. From this charge, however, he successfully cleared himself, the entire theological faculty, including Julius Müller and August Tholuck, bearing testimony to his sufficient orthodoxy. He died at Halle on 24 April 1866.

His earliest works in the department of Semitic philology (&quot;Exercitationes Aethiopicae&quot;, 1825, and &quot;De emendanda ratione lexicographiae Semiticae&quot;, 1827) were followed by the first part (1841), mainly historical and critical, of an &quot;Ausführliche Hebräische Grammatik&quot;, which he did not live to complete, and by a treatise on the early history of Hebrew grammar among the Jews (&quot;De rei grammaticae apud Judaeos initiis antiquissimisque scriptoribus&quot;, Halle, 1846).

His principal contribution to Biblical literature, the exegetical and critical &quot;Die Psalmen. Übersetzt und ausgelegt&quot;, began to appear in 1855, and was completed in 1861 (2nd ed. by E. Riehm, 1867–1871, 3rd ed. 1888). Other writings are:
*&quot;Über Begriff und Methode der sogenannten biblischen Einleitung&quot; (Marburg, 1844)
*&quot;De primitiva et Vera festorum apud Hebraeos ratione&quot; (Halle, 1851–1864)
*&quot;Die Quellen der Genesis von neuem untersucht&quot; (Berlin, 1853)
*&quot;Die heutige theosophische oder mythologische Theologie und Schrifterklärung&quot; (1861).

The main, recent biography, which for the first time includes archival sources, of Hupfeld is
* Otto Kaiser: &quot;Zwischen Reaktion und Revolution: Hermann Hupfeld (1796–1866) – ein deutsches Professorenleben&quot;, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Göttingen 2005.

<text>Crypto AG was a Swiss company specialising in communications and information security founded by Boris Hagelin in 1952. The company was secretly purchased for US $5.75 million and jointly owned by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and West German Federal Intelligence Service (BND) from 1970 until about 1993, with the CIA continuing as sole owner until about 2018. The mission of breaking encrypted communication using a secretly owned company was known as &quot;Operation Rubikon&quot;. With headquarters in Steinhausen, the company was a long-established manufacturer of encryption machines and a wide variety of cipher devices.

The company had about 230 employees, had offices in Abidjan, Abu Dhabi, Buenos Aires, Kuala Lumpur, Muscat, Selsdon and Steinhausen, and did business throughout the world. The owners of Crypto AG were unknown, supposedly even to the managers of the firm, and they held their ownership through bearer shares.

The company has been criticised for selling backdoored products to benefit the American, British and German national signals intelligence agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA), the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), and the BND, respectively. Crypto AG sold equipment to more than 120 countries, including India, Pakistan, Iran, and multiple Latin American nations. Although neither the Soviet Union nor People&#x27;s Republic of China were customers of Crypto AG, several of their friendly countries had the company&#x27;s equipment. On 11 February 2020, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, ZDF and SRF revealed that Crypto AG was secretly owned by the CIA in a highly classified partnership with West German intelligence, and the spy agencies could easily break the codes used to send encrypted messages. The operation was known first by the code name &quot;Thesaurus&quot; and later the BND called it &quot;Rubicon&quot; () and the CIA called it &quot;Minerva&quot;. According to a Swiss parliamentary investigation, &quot;Swiss intelligence service were aware of and benefited from the Zug-based firm Crypto AG’s involvement in the US-led spying&quot;.

== History ==
Crypto AG was established in Switzerland by the Russian-born Swede, Boris Hagelin. Originally called AB Cryptoteknik and founded by Arvid Gerhard Damm in Stockholm in 1920, the firm manufactured the C-36 mechanical cryptograph machine that Damm had patented. After Damm&#x27;s death, and just before the Second World War, Cryptoteknik came under the control of Hagelin, an early investor.

Hagelin&#x27;s hope was to sell the device to the United States Army. When Germany invaded Norway in 1940, he moved from Sweden to the US and presented the device to the military, which in turn brought the device to the Signal Intelligence Service, and the code-breakers in Arlington Hall. In the end he was awarded a licensing agreement. 140,000 units were made during the war for American troops.

During his time in United States, Hagelin became close friends with William F. Friedman, who in 1952 became chief cryptologist for the National Security Agency (NSA) and whom Hagelin had known since the 1930s. The same year, Hagelin&#x27;s lawyer, Stuart Hedden, became deputy commander in CIA, Inspector General.

In 1948 Hagelin moved to Steinhausen in Switzerland to avoid taxes. In 1952 the company, which until then had been incorporated in Stockholm, also moved to Switzerland. The official reason was that it was transferred as a result of a planned Swedish government nationalization of militarily important technology contractors. A holding company was set up in Liechtenstein.

During the 1950s, Hagelin and Friedman had frequent mail correspondence, both personal and business alike. Crypto AG sent over new machines to the NSA and they had an ongoing discussion concerning which countries they would or would not sell the encryption systems to, and which countries to sell older, weaker systems. In 1958 when Friedman retired, Howard C. Barlow, a high-ranking NSA employee, and Lawrence E. Shinn, NSA&#x27;s signal intelligence directory in Asia, took over the correspondence.

In June 1970, the company was bought in secret by the CIA and the West-German intelligence service, BND, for $5.75 million. This was effectively the start of Operation Rubikon. Hagelin had first been approached to sell to a partnership between the French and West-German intelligence services in 1967, but Hagelin contacted CIA and the Americans did not cooperate with the French. At this point, the company had 400 employees and the revenue increased from 100,000 Swiss franc in the 1950s to 14 million Swiss franc in the 1970s.

In 1994, Crypto AG bought InfoGuard AG a company providing encryption solutions to banks.

In 2010, Crypto AG sold G.V. LLC, a Wyoming company providing encryption and interception solutions for communications.

In 2018, Crypto AG was liquidated, and its assets and intellectual property sold to two new companies. CyOne was created for Swiss domestic sales, while Crypto International AG was founded in 2018 by Swedish entrepreneur Andreas Linde, who acquired the brand name, international distribution network, and product rights from the original Crypto AG.

In 2020, it was established following a parliamentary investigation that the Swiss government and its intelligence services were aware of the spying activities of Swiss-based Crypto for many years and had &quot;benefited from the US-led spying&quot;.

The company and its history were the subject of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Archive on 4&quot; programme in May 2021.

== Products ==

The company had radio, Ethernet, STM, GSM, phone and fax encryption systems in its portfolio.

Machines:

*C-52
*CX-52
*CD-57
*HX-63

== Compromised machines == 
According to declassified (but partly redacted) US government documents released in 2015, in 1955 (just after encryption was added to the US Munitions List on November 17, 1954) Crypto AG&#x27;s founder Boris Hagelin and William Friedman entered into an unwritten agreement concerning the C-52 encryption machines that compromised the security of some of the purchasers. Friedman was a notable US government cryptographer who was then working for the National Security Agency (NSA), the main United States signals intelligence agency. Hagelin kept both NSA and its United Kingdom counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), informed about the technical specifications of different machines and which countries were buying which machines. Providing such information would have allowed the intelligence agencies to reduce the time needed to crack the encryption of messages produced by such machines from impossibly long to a feasible length. The secret relationship initiated by the agreement also involved Crypto AG not selling machines such as the CX-52, a more advanced version of the C-52, to certain countries; and the NSA writing the operations manuals for some of the CX-52 machines on behalf of the company, to ensure the full strength of the machines would not be used, thus again reducing the necessary cracking effort.

Crypto AG had already earlier been accused of rigging its machines in collusion with intelligence agencies such as NSA, GCHQ, and the German Federal Intelligence Service (BND), enabling the agencies to read the encrypted traffic produced by the machines. Suspicions of this collusion were aroused in 1986 following US president Ronald Reagan&#x27;s announcement on national television that, through interception of diplomatic communications between Tripoli and the Libyan embassy in East Berlin, he had irrefutable evidence that Muammar Gaddafi of Libya was behind the West Berlin discotheque bombing in 1986. President Reagan then ordered the bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in retaliation.

Further evidence suggesting that the Crypto AG machines were compromised was revealed after the assassination of former Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar in 1991. On 7 August 1991, one day before Bakhtiar&#x27;s body was discovered, the Iranian Intelligence Service transmitted a coded message to Iranian embassies, inquiring &quot;Is Bakhtiar dead?&quot; Western governments deciphered this transmission, causing the Iranians to suspect their Crypto AG equipment.

The Iranian government then arrested Crypto AG&#x27;s top salesman, Hans Buehler, in March 1992 in Tehran. It accused Buehler of leaking their encryption codes to Western intelligence. Buehler was interrogated for nine months but, being completely unaware of any flaw in the machines, was released in January 1993 after Crypto AG posted bail of $1m to Iran. Soon after Buehler&#x27;s release Crypto AG dismissed him and sought to recover the $1m bail money from him personally. Swiss media and the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; took up his case in 1994, interviewing former employees and concluding that Crypto&#x27;s machines had in fact repeatedly been rigged.

Crypto AG rejected these accusations as &quot;pure invention&quot;, asserting in a press release that &quot;in March 1994, the Swiss Federal Prosecutor&#x27;s Office initiated a wide-ranging preliminary investigation against Crypto AG, which was completed in 1997. The accusations regarding influence by third parties or manipulations, which had been repeatedly raised in the media, proved to be without foundation.&quot; Subsequent commentators were unmoved by this denial, stating that it was likely that Crypto AG products were indeed rigged. &quot;Le Temps&quot; has argued that Crypto AG had been actively working with the British, US and West German secret services since 1956, going as far as to rig instruction manuals for the machines on the orders of the NSA. These claims were vindicated by US government documents declassified in 2015.

In 2020, an investigation carried out by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), and Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen (SRF) revealed that Crypto AG was, in fact, entirely controlled by the CIA and the BND. The project, initially known by codename &quot;Thesaurus&quot; and later as &quot;Rubicon&quot; operated from the end of the Second World War until 2018.

The Swiss government&#x27;s decision to impose export controls on Crypto International AG in the wake of the Crypto AG disclosures caused diplomatic tensions with Sweden, reportedly leading to the latter cancelling plans to celebrate 100 years of diplomatic relations with Switzerland. The export controls preventing Swedish authorities from obtaining equipment from Crypto International was reportedly a reason behind Sweden&#x27;s decision.

<doc id="602429" wikidata="Q18578" url="?curid=602429" title="The Book of Dust">
<text>The Book of Dust is a trilogy of fantasy novels by Philip Pullman, which expands his trilogy &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. The books further chronicle the adventures of Lyra Belacqua and her battle against the theocratic organisation known as the Magisterium, and shed more light on the mysterious substance called Dust.

The first book, &quot;La Belle Sauvage&quot;, was published in October 2017, and is set 12 years before &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. It describes how the 11-year-old Malcolm Polstead and the 15-year-old Alice protect the infant Lyra; leading to her being in the care of Jordan College. It introduces the research by academics and other free-thinkers into Dust, a mysterious subatomic particle related to consciousness, and the origins of Lyra&#x27;s alethiometer.

The second book, &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot;, was published on 3 October 2019 and is set after the events in the original trilogy with Lyra as a twenty-year-old undergraduate. Work on the third book in the series had not commenced at that time.

Pullman has said that the trilogy addresses consciousness: &quot;Perhaps the oldest philosophical question of all: are we matter? Or are we spirit and matter? What is consciousness if there is no spirit? Questions like that are of perennial fascination and they haven’t been solved yet, thank goodness.&quot; He added that the series might be slightly darker than the original, and quipped that it could alternatively be titled &quot;His Darker Materials&quot;.

==History of the trilogy==
Pullman conceived &quot;The Book of Dust&quot; before the publication of &quot;Lyra&#x27;s Oxford&quot; in 2003 and in 2005 he confirmed the book was &quot;under way&quot;. Early on he described it as being a longer book than he had initially imagined and later that he was considering writing two volumes, one set before &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; and the other set afterwards. In 2017 Pullman stated that &quot;The Book of Dust&quot; would be a new trilogy, and announced the publication of the first part, &quot;La Belle Sauvage,&quot; published on 19 October 2017. The books are jointly published by Random House Children&#x27;s and David Fickling Books in the United Kingdom, and by Random House Children&#x27;s Books in the US.

== Books ==
&quot;The Book of Dust&quot; takes place before, during and after the original trilogy; Pullman described it as an &quot;equel&quot;, rather than a sequel, which &quot;will begin and end with Lyra&quot;. In Pullman&#x27;s words the story&#x27;s main focus is: “the struggle between a despotic and totalitarian organisation, which wants to stifle speculation and enquiry, and those who believe thought and speech should be free”. The books will touch on research into Dust, the cosmic matter that governs consciousness. Pullman said the trilogy addresses consciousness: &quot;Perhaps the oldest philosophical question of all: are we matter? Or are we spirit and matter? What is consciousness if there is no spirit? Questions like that are of perennial fascination and they haven’t been solved yet, thank goodness.”

=== &quot;La Belle Sauvage&quot; ===

The first book, &quot;La Belle Sauvage&quot;, was published in October 2017, and is set around 11 years before &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. It describes how the 11-year-old Malcolm Polstead and the 15-year-old Alice protect the infant Lyra; leading to her being in the care of Jordan College. It introduces the research by academics and other free-thinkers into Dust, a mysterious subatomic particle related to consciousness, and the origins of Lyra&#x27;s alethiometer.

=== &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot; ===

The second volume, &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot;, was published on 3 October 2019, and begins with Lyra as a 20-year-old undergraduate. It involves her journeying to the Far East via the Levant. &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot; takes its title from a compilation of folklore by Robert Kirk that Pullman has said is one of his favourite books.

===The third book===
During a launch event for &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot; in October 2019, Pullman said, &quot;We can see where the story is going in this book. It&#x27;s going towards Central Asia, it involves roses and it involves Dust. That&#x27;s all I can tell you⁠—I don&#x27;t even have a title for it yet!&quot; though he had earlier mentioned possible titles such as &quot;The Garden of Roses&quot; or &quot;Roses from the South&quot;. A short excerpt of the first chapter is available as part of an interview on the blog of Goldsmiths, University of London.

On 11 February 2023, Pullman said on Twitter that he had written 350 pages of the book. In November 2023, Pullman announced that he had written 500 pages of a 540-page novel which would conclude the trilogy. He added that it would be published sometime in 2024, though he had yet to decide on a title. In mid-August 2024, Pullman said on Twitter that the book was finished, but that it still needed to be edited. At the end of January 2025, Pullman confirmed on Twitter that the book was finished and that he &quot;very much hope[d] that it&#x27;ll be published this year&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
The first book was adapted into a play of the same name by Bryony Lavery. A production of which, directed by Nicholas Hytner, played at the Bridge Theatre between November 2021 and February 2022 and which was broadcast by National Theatre Live on February 17, 2022.

<text>The IMSAI 8080 is an early microcomputer released in late 1975, based on the Intel 8080 (and later 8085) and S-100 bus. It is a clone of its main competitor, the earlier MITS Altair 8800. The IMSAI is largely regarded as the first &quot;clone&quot; microcomputer. The IMSAI machine runs a highly modified version of the CP/M operating system called IMDOS. It was developed, manufactured and sold by IMS Associates, Inc. (later renamed to IMSAI Manufacturing Corp). In total, between 17,000 and 20,000 units were produced from 1975 to 1978.

== History ==

In May 1972, William Millard started a business called IMS Associates (IMS) in the areas of computer consulting and engineering, using his home as an office. By 1973, Millard incorporated the business and soon found funding for it, receiving several contracts, all for software. IMS stood for &quot;Information Management Services&quot;.

In 1974, IMS was contacted by a client which wanted a &quot;workstation system&quot; that could complete jobs for any General Motors car dealership. IMS planned a system including a terminal, small computer, printer, and special software. Five of these workstations were to have common access to a hard disk drive, which would be controlled by a small computer. Eventually product development was stopped.

Millard and his chief engineer Joe Killian turned to the microprocessor. Intel had announced the 8080 chip, and compared to the 4004 to which IMS Associates had been first introduced, it looked like a &quot;real computer&quot;. Full-scale development of the IMSAI 8080 was put into action using the existing Altair 8800&#x27;s S-100 bus, and by October 1975 an ad was placed in &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;, receiving positive reactions.

IMS shipped the first IMSAI 8080 kits on 16 December 1975, before turning to fully assembled units. In 1976, IMS was renamed to IMSAI Manufacturing Corporation because by then, they were a manufacturing company, not a consulting firm.

In 1977, IMSAI marketing director Seymour I. Rubinstein paid Gary Kildall $25,000 for the right to run CP/M version 1.3, which eventually evolved into an operating system called IMDOS, on IMSAI 8080 computers. Other manufacturers followed and CP/M eventually became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard 8-bit operating system.

By October 1979, the IMSAI corporation was bankrupt. The VDP (all-in-one) computer had sold poorly and was not competitive with the Radio Shack TRS-80, Commodore PET, and Apple II computers. The &#x27;IMSAI&#x27; trademark was acquired by Thomas &quot;Todd&quot; Fischer and Nancy Freitas (former early employees of IMS Associates), who continued manufacturing the computers under the IMSAI name as a division of Fischer-Freitas Co. Support for early IMSAI systems continues. The first registration of the trademark IMSAI was on 17 January 1980. The right to the word mark IMSAI expired on 6 April 2004 because Thomas Fischer did not correctly submit the required documents for renewal.


IMSAI 8080 replicas have entered the market, due in part to the legality of copying hardware designs encouraging amateur technophiles to make backwards compatible machines, with the retro aesthetics. The color scheme matches the original IMS 1973 &quot;Hypercube&quot; project, but some peripherals such as the floppy are simulated and instead use Wi-fi.

== VDP series ==
In mid-1977, IMSAI released the VDP-series, based on the Intel 8085. According to the product description of January 1978, many different models were released, with 32K or 64K memory and a 9&quot; (VDP4x-range) or 12&quot; (VDP8x-range) video display. For example, the VDP-40 had two 5-1/4&quot; disk drives, a 9&quot; 40-character-wide display and a 2K ROM monitor all in one cabinet. The built-in keyboard had a 8035 microprocessor and a serial interface to the main board. The VIO-C video board had 2K firmware ROM, 2K character generator read-only memory (ROM) with 256 characters and 2K of refresh memory.

The VDP80/1050 was listed in January 1978 for and the VDP-40/64 for .

<text>T. James Belich (born 1976, also known by the pseudonym of Colorado Tolston) is an American playwright and actor. He is the author of a dozen plays in genres that include mystery, fantasy, religious, and children&#x27;s. His works have been performed not only in the United States, but also around the world in places such as Africa, the United Kingdom, the Philippines and New Zealand.

Belich has been heavily influenced by the works of such authors as C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Madeleine L&#x27;Engle.

In 2002, Belich helped found the Critical Mass Playwrighting Fellowship in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, which led to creation of the Hodge-Podge Players (now the Hodge-Podge Theatre Company), a theatre group which focuses on presenting theatre for youth and family audiences. The Hodge-Podge Theatre Company primarily produces original work by Critical Mass members.

In addition to his career as a playwright, Belich also has a background in the sciences, having studied physics at the University of Minnesota where he earned a PhD under his advisor, Dr. James Kakalios.

Belich has also been active in the theatre in other capacities. He has acted in a wide range of roles, and has worked behind the scenes in positions ranging from lighting designer to producer. In 2006 he brought his own play, Illinois Jane and the Pyramid of Peril, to the Minnesota Fringe Festival with his new company, The Pauper&#x27;s Theater. Belich currently resides in Saint Paul, Minnesota, with his wife Kelly.

<doc id="602437" wikidata="Q681010" url="?curid=602437" title="Šajkaši">
<text>Šajkaši (In Serbian, , ) refers to the river flotilla troops guarding the Danube and Sava, and especially, the Port of Belgrade, against the Ottoman Empire from the 16th to the 19th century. During that period, the rivers were natural borders of the Kingdom of Hungary and Habsburg monarchy with the Ottoman Empire, part of the Military Frontier. The troops were composed of ethnic Serbs, who had special military status. Their name derives from the small wooden boat known as &quot;chaika&quot; (šajka, tschaiken), a type of galley.

==Organization==

===Personal armament===
The Šajkaši were armed with sabres, spears and ordinary and mechanical arrows. Sometimes they wore helmets and shields. Their spears likely were longer than ordinary, set to be used at longer distances. They used arrows until the end of the 16th century when the arquebus had been perfected. Later, when gunpowder began to be widely used, the Šajkaši were armed with sabres, long spears and muskets.

===Warship armament===
;Late 15th and 16th century
In 1475, King Matthias had in his Danube Flotilla around 330 chaika with 10,000 men, among which were 1,700 lancers, 1,200 men-at-arms, while &quot;the rest were catapultists and crossbowers&quot;. In the Belgrade port, 34 chaika with 18 oars, 18 soldiers and a catapult at the front were stationed. Larger chaika, of which there were 16, had 24 oars and 300-man-crew, 4 large guns at the front, &quot;from which 100-pounds of weight of shots, 100 &quot;carbott&quot; or &quot;pisside&quot; (types of shells), and 200 hand-guns, were shot&quot;. Apart from the ordinary chaika, there were larger ones, called &quot;galleys&quot;.

===Clothing===
Their clothing was in dark-blue colour.

===Ranks===
;Hungary, 16th century
*The supreme commanders of Šajkaši commands in Hungarian service were called &quot;vajd&quot; (from &quot;vojvoda&quot;). These were usually selected – retired Šajkaši would choose four candidates, of which the captain would choose one for the command. There were instances when the vajd was appointed, but this right, it seems, was only held by the monarch. The vajd stayed in his position until death. The number of vajds was never determined, and it varied depending on the sizes of the Šajkaši crews. There were usually 20–40. In 1521, in Belgrade, there were only 3, while in Varadin 7, and in Slankamen 5. In 1537, there were 17 vajds in Komárom, down to 7 in 1546. The vajd usually served at one place, but there were instances when he was transferred.

==History==
===16th century===
Pavle Bakić commanded the Šajkaši in the service of Ferdinand, the Archduke of Austria and King of Hungary and Croatia. The Šajkaši participated in the Battle of Mohács (1526). After the battle the Šajkaši were still unpaid for their services. Ferdinand reprimanded the court for not having paid at least part of the unpaid salary to the Šajkaši. Bakić once again turned to Ferdinand, alerting him that the nonpayment to the Šajkaši would cause estrangement of the Serbs in his lands, and those of Zapolya and the Ottoman Empire. He also informed Ferdinand of the persecution of Serbs by the Austrian staff and officers.

===17th century===
From all the writings in Serbian and German by the estimable Archimandrite Jovan Rajić (Johann Raics, 1726–1801), it has been established that the old Šajkaš Corps had their staff in the city of Komárno (Comorn, Hungarian: Komorom) which is along the upper Danube and that the personnel were under the Hungarian and Polish King Ladislaus III (1424-1444) and those following him until they were included under the rule of Leopold I (1640-1705).

The old Šajkaš Corps was established in 1526 and dissolved in 1746.

By far the majority of the Šajkaši were Serbs who had come north and west as direct result of the Turkish advance into the Balkans. As Ottoman conquest continued throughout the 1500s, thousands fled north across the Danube into lands vacated by the Serbs, also moving away from the Turks. In addition, thousands of refugees, generally of the Orthodox faith, had entered the largely deserted lands of northern Medieval Serbia where few of the original natives had survived the brutal wars. These Serbs formed the nucleus of the military frontiersmen, beginning in the early 1500s, and of the river fleet, the Šajkaši formations.

In 1690, a major Serbian immigration took place. Some 30,000 families from Kosovo sought refuge across the Sava and Danube rivers among their kin folk after the Austrian supported revolt failed and left them defenceless in the face of Ottoman reprisals.

===18th century===
These newly arrived Serbs together with the members of the earlier Šajkaši Corps formed the new Šajkaši Battalion on the lower Danube. They defended the border between the Habsburg and Ottoman empires.

Like the other regiments of the Austrian Military Frontier, the Šajkaši settled the deserted borderlands designated for them by the Austrian crown in exchange for military service. The Šajkaši battalion&#x27;s first lower Danube villages were: Titel, Lok, Mošorin (Moschorin), Vilovo (Willova), Gardinovci (Gardinovatz) and Žabalj (Zsablia, formerly Josefdorf).

Six more villages were authorized on 7 June 1769: Čurug, Gospođinci, Šajkaš (St. Ivan), Upper Kovilj, Lower Kovilj, and Kać (Kaacs). In 1800 and 1801, two more -- Djurdjevo and Nadalj—were also settled. On 1 January 1809, the battalion totaled six companies (a division).

This battalion, along the model of the other regiments of the Military Frontier, was organized according to the standing order of the Austrian military-civil administration. The duties of and support for the Battalion&#x27;s frontiersmen were the same as all other frontiersmen.

A history of the Šajkaš Battalion was written between 1842 and 1847 by one of its officers, Captain Jovan Trumić. Apparently the only surviving copy is now at the Serbian scholarly society, &quot;Matica srpska&quot;, in Novi Sad.

The original Trumić manuscript and other documents about the Šajkaši were brought to light in 2004 by Slavko Gavrilović, a Serbian scholar who specialized in the Šajkaš Battalion.

Included in Captain Trumić&#x27;s study are valuable statistics from 1844. There were 30,315 inhabitants on the lands of the Šajkaš Battalion at that time: 28,656 Serbs; 758 Germans; 528 Hungarians; 196 Wallachians; and 177 others. Within the jurisdiction of the Battalion, there were 28,275 Eastern Orthodox Christians (Non-Uniates, mostly Serbs); 1,627 Roman Catholics (includes Croatians); 329 Protestant Evangelists (Lutherans); 63 Uniates; and 21 Protestant Reformed (Calvenists).

Among the additional documents Slavko Gavrilović published in 2004 is a list of the officers who served in the Šajka Battalion between 1762 and 1873. Captain Trumić is among them.

A total of 246 Serbian officers are listed. The list is interesting today for the large number of Serbian officers and for the details about their military service which provide information about the officers of both the Šajkaš Battalion and the Military Frontier.
The list is chronological. The dates and places correspond not only to assignments within the Military Frontier but also to postings in far-away wars waged by the Habsburg crown. The list reveals that these officers were transferred to those wars.

After 1699, the service of the military frontiersmen was not limited to protecting the Habsburg Empire from the Ottomans. They were required, by regulation, to serve where called. The high command in Vienna viewed the Military Frontier as a vast pool of self-sufficient recruits for the Austrian military, and their participation in the major wars involving the Austrian crown seems to bear this out.

===19th century===
By an imperial decree of the Habsburg ruler, Empress Maria Theresa, a special unit of the Austrian Danube Fleet, the Šajkaš Battalion of the lower Danube, was created in 1763. It was abolished under another Habsburg, Emperor Franz Joseph, in 1872.

Of the Battalion&#x27;s Serbian officers, 89 were promoted from the ranks of non-commissioned officers. Sixty came from several of the Military Frontier&#x27;s other regiments which were either named for the regimental headquarter cities—Brod, Gradiska, Ogulin, Otocac, Petrovaradin, Slunj, Titel and Varazdin—or regions of the Military Frontier -- Banat, Banija, Lika, and Slavonia. Some were cadets or arrived fresh from the Military Frontier School in Vienna.

The Trumić list includes the year the officers joined the Battalion and his rank and prior post. Also shown are each officer&#x27;s promotions and the year he was transferred out of the Battalion as well as his rank and new post.

A staggering number military frontiersmen (&quot;graničari&quot; as they were called in Serbian) from the regiments of the Military Frontier were called up to the Austrian armies engaged in various European wars, such as the Austrian War of Succession (1741-1748); the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756-1763); the Bavarian War of Succession (1778-1779); the wars against post-revolutionary France (1792-1800); the Napoleonic Wars (1805-1815); the Austro-Italian Wars (1848-1849, 1859, 1866) and the Revolution of 1848 and the wars against the Hungarians (1848-1849).

Postings on the list include places in northern Italy, Mantua and Solferino, made famous in the Napoleonic Wars and in the Austro-Italian Wars. According to the list, Lieutenant Michael Stanisavljević was transferred to Mantua in 1784 and Captain Marcus Rajčević was killed in the Battle of Solferino in 1859.

During the Austro-Turkish War of 1788–1791, the Austrians organized Serbian volunteers into special military force known as the Serbian Free Corps (&quot;Frei Corps&quot;), usually commanded by Austrian officers of Serbian descent. From the Šajkaš Battalion, Adjutant George Bešanović transferred to the Bosnian-Serbian &quot;Frei Corps&quot; in 1788.

Lieutenant Gligorije Popović and Lieutenant Thimotie Zivković transferred to Count Gyulay&#x27;s &quot;Frei Corps&quot; in 1793. Lieutenant Arsenije Sečujac transferred to the 3rd Serbian &quot;Frei Crops&quot; Battalion in 1813.

Thirty-five were transferred to other regiments of the Military Frontier. Fifty-one died while in serving in the Battalion, but whether the death was in line of duty is not specified. Seventy-seven retired from the Battalion with pensions. The length of service varied from a few months to as many as 30 years, if not more.

Several Serbs became majors, colonels and battalion commanders. In 1763, the year the Šajkaš Battalion was created, Theodor Stanisavljević was a Major and the Battalion Commander of the Petrovaradin Frontier Infantry Regiment. In 1773, he was Colonel in the Šajkaš Battalion. He died in 1783.

Colonel Aron Stanisavljević, in 1813 after 35 years with the Battalion, was promoted to Brigadier General and Major-General and transferred to Banat. That same year, Lieutenant Colonel Johann Nepomuk Majdić became Battalion Commander.

In 1816, Captain Thimotie Zivković returned to the Battalion and was promoted to Colonel and battalion Commander. In 1835, Colonel Franz Jankovic was appointed Major General and Commander of the Supreme Shipping Office in Vienna.

In 1849, Major Johann Bunčić was the Battalion Commander of the Ogulin Frontier Regiment and Adjutant to the Austrian-Serbian Army Corps when he joined the Sajkas Battalion. The next year, he was transferred to the Petrovaradin Frontier Infantry Regiment as a colonel.

===Šajkaši Battalion===
The Frontier Šajkaši Battalion (&quot;Krajiški šajkaški bataljon&quot;), known in German as Czaikisten-Bataillon, was active in the period of 1763–1873. After the Treaty of Belgrade (1739) the Habsburg-Ottoman border was set up on the Danube and Sava rivers. The Šajkaši bands in Komárno, Esztergom, Győr and other places were abolished, until the establishment of the Šajkaši Battalion in Bačka, between the Danube and Tisa, in 1763 upon decision of the Habsburg War Council. The Serb colonising community which was employed into the battalion (the &quot;šajkaši&quot;) was given the Šajkaška region, which initially included six villages, eventually increased by eight. The battalion headquarters were in Titel. The battalion had four bands in 1769, with ca. 1,116 men, although it was constantly expanded.

==Šajkaši migrations==
Šajkaši families, Serbs, settled in Esztergom during the rule of Matthias Corvinus, a settlement in the lower town developed from the community, called &quot;Srpska varoš&quot;.

A group of Serbian Šajkaši settled in Slovakia, where they continued their service, known in Slovak as &quot;čajkári&quot;.

==Legacy==
In Hungarian war annals the most clear and also most vulnerable place is taken by the King&#x27;s Šajkaši. They were the most important factors and participants of the victories of the Royal Army. Whenever there was a threat to Hungary, the Šajkaši were the main support of the territorial defence and the most reliable aid to the Royal Army.

Stationed at many locations, the most important Šajkaši units were those of Komárom, as this was the most important Imperial fortress in Hungary; they were stationed here up until the reign of Maria Theresa, when they were moved to South Bačka.

The &quot;šajkača&quot; hat is derived from the 18th-century Šajkaši in Banat.

<text>Eduard Karl August Riehm (20 December 18305 April 1888) was a German Protestant theologian.

He was born at Diersburg in Baden. He studied theology and philology at Heidelberg and later at Halle under Hermann Hupfeld, who persuaded him to include Arabic, Syriac and Egyptian. Entering the ministry in 1853, he was made vicar at Durlach soon afterwards, and became a licentiate in the theological faculty at Heidelberg. In 1854 he was appointed garrison-preacher at Mannheim for the Evangelical Church in Baden; and in 1858 he was licensed to lecture at Heidelberg, where in 1861 he was made professor &quot;extraordinarius&quot;. In 1862 he obtained a similar post at Halle, and in 1866 was promoted to the rank of professor &quot;ordinarius&quot;. As of 1878 he was a member of provincial synod of the Ecclesiastical Province of Saxony within the Evangelical Church of Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces, advancing to member of the provincial synodal board in 1885, and becoming a member of the old-Prussian general synod too.

Throughout his life he followed Hupfeld&#x27;s plan in his scientific treatment of the Old Testament—that of reconciling the results of a free criticism with a belief in divine revelations. His practical experience of pastoral work also proved of service to him when he became a professor of theology, for if there is one quality more striking than another in the writings of Riehm, it is that of sympathy with orthodox believers (TK Cheyne). In 1865 Riehm was made a member of the commission for the revision of Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible, and became one of the editors of the quarterly review, &quot;Theologische Studien und Kritiken&quot;.

His works include:
*&quot;Die Gesetzgebung Moses im Lande Moab&quot; (1854), in which the Deuteronomic law book is assigned to the second half of the reign of Manasseh
*&quot;Lehrbegriff des Hebräerbriefes&quot; (1858–59, 2nd ed. 1867)
*&quot;Hermann Hupfeld, Lebens-und Charakterbild des deutschen Professors&quot; (1867)
*&quot;Die Messianische Weissagung&quot; (1875, 2nd ed. 1883; Eng. trans. 1890)
*&quot;Religion und Wissenschaft&quot; (1881)
*the well-known &quot;Handwörterbuchs des biblischen Altertums für gebildete Bibelleser&quot; (2 vols., 1884; 2nd. ed. revised by F Baethgen, 1892–94)
After his death were published the &quot;Einleitung in das Alte Testament&quot; (1889, ed. by A Brandt), in which the date of the Deuteronomic law book is placed earlier than in his book on the legislation of Moses—shortly before or at the beginning of the reign of Hezekiah; and his &quot;Alttestamentliche Theologie&quot; (1889, ed. by Pahncke). See Herzog-Hauck, &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;, and TK Cheyne, &quot;Founders of Old Testament Criticism&quot;.

<doc id="602443" wikidata="Q2451406" url="?curid=602443" title="Interstate 481">
<text>Interstate 481 (I-481) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway that serves as an eastern bypass of Syracuse, New York, in the US. It begins at its parent, I-81, in the city&#x27;s southern end and travels through the eastern Syracuse suburbs of Jamesville, DeWitt, and Cicero before rejoining I-81 in the suburb of North Syracuse. Upon crossing I-81 in North Syracuse, I-481 continues northwest to Fulton and Oswego as New York State Route 481 (NY 481). I-481 is part of the Veterans Memorial Highway, which extends northward onto NY 481. Future plans call for I-481 to be decommissioned by a reroute of I-81 onto the freeway.

==Route description==
I-481 begins at I-81&#x27;s exit 82 (exit 1A on I-81), a directional T interchange in the South Valley section of the city of Syracuse. Immediately crossing under NY 173, I-481 proceeds eastward alongside Rock Cut Road (unsigned County Route 103 [CR 103]), which meets the freeway at exit 83 heading east. I-481 crosses out of Syracuse and into the town of Onondaga, paralleling Rock Cut Road into Clark Reservation State Park. The Interstate Highway makes a bend to the northeast, crossing over tracks used by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway and entering exit 85, which connects to Jamesville Road (CR 7).

After exit 2, I-481 makes a bend to the north, crossing east of Butternut Creek Golf Course as it crosses into the town of DeWitt. In DeWitt, I-481 enters an interchange (exit 87) with NY 5 and NY 92 (East Genesee Street) just west of the hamlet of Lyndon. After the junction, I-481 continues bending to the northeast, crossing the west end of Old Erie Canal State Park and east of White Chapel Memory Gardens before entering a large interchange with the eastern terminus of I-690. Just north of the interchange, I-481 crosses over NY 290 (Manlius Center Road) and CSX Transportation&#x27;s DeWitt Yard. A short distance after the railroad, I-481 enters exit 90, which connects to Kirkville Road (CR 53).

After the interchange with CR 53, I-481 continues northward through DeWitt, paralleling Fly Road (CR 77). A short distance later, I-481 crosses over the New York State Thruway (I-90) and enters exit 91, a trumpet interchange leading to exit 34A of the Thruway. A short distance after the Thruway, I-481 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with NY 298 (Collamer Road). The freeway continues northeast, crossing over East Taft Road (CR 18) in DeWitt before bending northwest into the town of Cicero. In Cicero, I-481 enters an interchange (exit 95) with Northern Boulevard (CR 82). A short distance to the west in the town of North Syracuse, I-481 enters exit 96, a cloverleaf interchange with exit 11 on I-81. At this junction, the designation of I-481 ends while NY 481 continues northwestward toward Oswego.

==History==
What is now I-481 was originally proposed as parts of two separate highways bypassing the city of Syracuse. From the New York State Thruway (I-90) in DeWitt southwest to I-81 in the south end of Syracuse, the highway was originally designated as I-281. North of the thruway, modern I-481 was initially part of &quot;Relocated Route 57&quot;, a proposed limited-access highway extending from NY 57 in Fulton to the thruway in DeWitt via North Syracuse. All of I-281 and the segment of Relocated Route 57 east of I-81 in North Syracuse were redesignated as I-481 on January 1, 1970.

The first section of the highway to be constructed was the portion between Jamesville Road and NY 5. Work on this portion of the freeway began and was completed and opened to traffic by 1965. Construction of I-281, and later I-481, initially progressed northward from NY 5. The segment between Lyndon and I-690 was opened to traffic in the early 1970s, while the piece between I-690 and the thruway was completed by 1977. To the southwest, the section of I-481 from I-81 to Jamesville Road was finished in the early 1980s, finally connecting I-481 to its parent. The last portion of the route from the thruway to I-81 in North Syracuse was completed south of NY 298 by 1985 and finished by 1990.

==Future==
As part of the demolition and replacement of I-81 through Downtown Syracuse, I-481 will be redesignated as I-81, while the current route of I-81 will be redesignated as I-81 Business (I-81 Bus). As part of the project, both interchanges between I-81 and I-481 would be reconstructed. The ramps would be expanded to carry more traffic to account for the increased traffic. Also as part of the project, I-481 would be expanded to three lanes each way between exits 89 (I-690) and 90 (Kirkville Road); to three lanes northbound between exits 90 and 91 (I-90); and to three lanes southbound between exits 96 (I-81) and 95 (Northern Boulevard). Construction was expected to start in mid-2020 and take five years to complete. However, in May 2021, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the project would not commence until the following year. At this time, the New York state government allocated $800 million to the &quot;community grid&quot; plan. In preparation for the reconstruction/relocation of I-81 around Syracuse, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), at its annual Spring Meeting in May 2021, conditionally approved the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT)&#x27;s application to reroute I-81 over I-481 around the east side of Syracuse and redesignate I-81 through Syracuse as I-81 Bus, pending concurrence from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The I-481 designation will be eliminated once these route changes have been completed.

==Exit list==
Exit numbers follow I-81&#x27;s future rerouting around Syracuse.

<doc id="602445" wikidata="Q231997" url="?curid=602445" title="Sadako Sasaki">
<text>was a Japanese girl who became a victim of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. She was two years of age when the bombs were dropped and was severely irradiated. She survived for another ten years, becoming one of the most widely known &quot;hibakusha&quot;—a Japanese term meaning &quot;bomb-affected person&quot;. She is remembered through the story of the more than one thousand origami cranes she folded before her death. She died at the age of 12 on October 25, 1955, at the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital.

==Event==
Sasaki was at home, about away from ground zero, when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. She was blown out of the window and her mother ran out to find her, suspecting she might be dead, but instead finding her two-year-old daughter alive with no apparent injuries. While they were fleeing, Sadako and her mother were caught in black rain. Her grandmother ran back inside and died near the house, apparently trying to escape fires by hiding in a cistern.

===Aftermath===
Sasaki grew up like her peers and became an important member of her class relay team. In November 1954, Sasaki developed swellings on her neck and behind her ears. In January 1955, purpura had formed on her legs. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with acute malignant lymph gland leukemia (her mother and others in Hiroshima referred to it as &quot;atomic bomb disease&quot;). She was hospitalized on February 21, 1955, and given no more than a year to live.

Several years after the atomic explosion, an increase in leukemia was observed, especially among young children. By the early 1950s, it was clear that the leukemia was caused by radiation exposure from the bomb.

She was admitted as a patient to the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital for treatment and given blood transfusions on February 21, 1955. By the time she was admitted, her white blood cell count was six times higher than the average child&#x27;s levels.

==Origami cranes==
In August 1955, she was moved into a room with a girl named Kiyo, a junior high school student who was two years older than her. Shortly after, cranes were brought to her room from a local high school club. Sasaki&#x27;s friend, Chizuko Hamamoto, told her the legend of the cranes and she set herself a goal of folding 1,000 of them, which was believed to grant the folder a wish. Although she had plenty of free time during her days in the hospital, Sasaki lacked paper, so she used medicine wrappings and whatever else she could scrounge; including going to other patients&#x27; rooms to ask for the paper from their get-well presents. Chizuko also brought paper from school for Sasaki to use.

A popular version of the story is that Sasaki fell short of her goal of folding 1,000 cranes, having folded only 644 before her death and that her friends completed the 1,000 and buried them all with her. (This comes from the novelized version of her life &quot;Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes&quot;.) However, an exhibit that appeared in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum stated that by the end of August 1955, Sasaki had achieved her goal and continued to fold 300 more cranes. Sasaki&#x27;s older brother, Masahiro Sasaki, says in his book &quot;The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki&quot; that she exceeded her goal.

==Death==

During her time in the hospital, her condition progressively worsened. Around mid-October 1955, her left leg became swollen and turned purple. After her family urged her to eat something, Sasaki requested tea on rice and remarked, &quot;it&#x27;s tasty&quot;. She then thanked her family, those being her last words. With her family and friends around her, Sasaki died on the morning of October 25, 1955, at the age of 12.

After her death, Sasaki&#x27;s body was examined by the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) for research on the effects of the atomic bomb on the human body before she was cremated.

==Memorials==
After her death, Sasaki&#x27;s friends and schoolmates published a collection of letters in order to raise funds to build a memorial to her and all of the children who had died from the effects of the atomic bomb, including another Japanese girl Yoko Moriwaki. In 1958, a statue of Sasaki holding a golden crane was unveiled in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. At the foot of the statue is a plaque that reads: &quot;This is our cry. This is our prayer. Peace in the world.&quot; Every year during the Obon holiday, which is a holiday in Japan to remember the departed spirits of one&#x27;s ancestors, thousands of people leave paper cranes near the statue. A paper crane database has been established online for contributors to leave a message of peace and to keep a record of those who have donated cranes.

Sasaki and the family have donated some of Sadako&#x27;s cranes at places of importance around the world: in NYC at the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum, at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum on November 19, 2015, at Museum of Tolerance on May 26, 2016, and the Japanese American National Museum three days later. USS Arizona Memorial Crane Donation and President Truman Museum Donation helped by Clifton Truman Daniel, who is the grandson of President Truman. There was a statue of her in the Seattle Peace Park which was stolen in July of 2024 and remains missing. 

Sasaki has become a leading symbol of the effects of nuclear war and has become an international symbol for peace and a peaceful world, especially during the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. 

Sasaki is also a heroine for many girls in Japan. Her story is told in some Japanese schools on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. Dedicated to Sasaki, people all over Japan celebrate August 6 as the annual peace day.

Artist Sue DiCicco founded the Peace Crane Project in 2013 to celebrate Sasaki&#x27;s legacy and connect students around the world in a vision of peace. DiCicco and Sasaki&#x27;s brother co-wrote a book about Sasaki, &quot;The Complete Story of Sadako Sasaki&quot;, hoping to bring her true story to English speaking countries. Their website offers a study guide for students and an opportunity to &quot;Ask Masahiro&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The most well-known version of Sasaki&#x27;s story is &quot;Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes&quot;, a children&#x27;s historical novel written by Canadian-American author Eleanor Coerr and published in 1977.

Her story has become familiar to many schoolchildren around the world through the novels &quot;The Day of the Bomb&quot; (1961, in German, &quot;Sadako will leben&quot;) by the Austrian writer Karl Bruckner. Sadako is also briefly mentioned in &quot;Children of the Ashes&quot;, Robert Jungk&#x27;s historical account of the lives of Hiroshima victims and survivors and about Japan World War II.

The death of Sasaki inspired Dagestani Russian poet Rasul Gamzatov, who had paid a visit to the city of Hiroshima, to write an Avar poem, &quot;Zhuravli&quot;, which eventually became one of Russia&#x27;s greatest war ballads.

A fictionalized version of Sadako appears as a character in the Soviet film &quot;Hello, Children!&quot; (&quot;Zdravstvuite, deti!&quot;), directed by Mark Donskoy. 

Sasaki&#x27;s life and death are also the subject of the song &quot;Cranes over Hiroshima&quot; by American singer-songwriter Fred Small.

Sadako&#x27;s story was dramatized at the opening ceremony of the Goodwill Games 1990 in Seattle when, to Ellie Rabb&#x27;s narration of Sadako&#x27;s story, some 400 local schoolchildren handed out some 20,000 origami paper cranes to the opening day crowd, thereby honoring the memory of Sadako and spreading her unfulfilled dream for world peace. The Seattle souvenir cranes were supposedly crafted from an original 1,000 pieces sent over by children from Japan. 

Laurie Rubin and Jenny Taira, co-founders and artistic directors of Ohana Arts, a children&#x27;s theater and arts organization based in Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i, wrote a musical for young performers called &quot;Peace on Your Wings&quot;, based on the life of Sadako and her message of hope and peace for the world. The musical has been performed across the United States and has the support and approval of members of Sadako&#x27;s surviving family. 

The album &quot;Wanderer&quot; by the death metal/metalcore band Heaven Shall Burn features a song called &quot;Passage of the Crane&quot; dedicated to her story, as does &quot;Sadako&#x27;s Wings of Hope&quot; on Niobeth&#x27;s album &quot;Silvery Moonbeams&quot;.

The 2020 album &quot;Sadako e le mille gru di carta&quot; by Italian progressive rock band LogoS is a tribute to Sadako&#x27;s legacy, and was released on the 75th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing.

The song &quot;Unfinished Dream Of Sadako&quot; by the Iranian post-rock band, Crows in the Rain, is dedicated to her story.

<text>The Narva, formerly also Narwa or Narova, flows north into the Baltic Sea and is the largest Estonian river by discharge. A similar length of land far to the south, together with it and a much longer intermediate lake, Lake Peipus, all together nowadays form the international border between Estonia and Russia.

The river gives its name to the archaeological (Neolithic) Narva culture, as well as the city of Narva. Narva is the third most populous urban area in Estonia, and nowadays faces the Russian town of Ivangorod right across the border over the river.

At the coast the river passes part of the resort of Narva-Jõesuu. Its mouth opens into WNW-facing Narva Bay of the Gulf of Finland. Narva gives the second-greatest discharge into the Gulf of Finland (the greatest discharge comes from the Neva River). 

==Etymology==
The etymology of the toponym &quot;Narva&quot; is not clear. According to one hypothesis it is related to the Finnic word &quot;narva&quot; which, for example, in Veps means &#x27;waterfall&#x27; or &#x27;stream&#x27;.

==Geography==

The Narva River has its source at the northeastern end of Lake Peipus, near the villages of Vasknarva (Estonia) and Skyamya (Russia). There are a few more small villages on the upper section of the river, Permisküla and Kuningaküla on the Estonian side and Omuti on the Russian side, but up to the city of Narva the shores of the river are mostly forested or marshy land. The river is dammed entering Narva and Ivangorod, forming the Narva Reservoir, which extends up to upstream. The Narva empties into Narva Bay near the Estonian town of Narva-Jõesuu, third largest settlement on the river after Narva and Ivangorod.

The Plyussa is the largest tributary, joining the Narva River at the reservoir from the right. The large Lake Peipus notably drains the much longer Russian river, the Velikaya, and a large, splayed drainage basin in the two countries.

===Waterfall===
Kreenholm ( for &quot;crow islet&quot;) is a river island in Estonia, located in the Narva River, within the city limits of Narva.

Between the southeast part of the city of Narva and the rest, facing the Russian city of Ivangorod, the river flows over the Baltic Klint, forming Narva Falls, at times, as it historically was, the most powerful in Europe. Before the water reaches the falls it is split into two branches by the Kreenholm island, thus the falls consist of two branches. Kreenholm Falls, west of the island, is wide and high with multiple terraces. Joala Falls, to the east, is wide and makes the same descent. The international border follows the latter.

Since the creation of Narva Reservoir, an anabranch, in 1955, the falls are usually near-dry, but water is allowed to flow in them for a few days each year. When in flow non-flying viewing access is difficult, being in the border zone and most of the west bank is private, closed industrial land belonging to Krenholm Manufacturing Company.

==History==
The Narva was used as a trade route during the Viking Age, from the 5th to 11th centuries. It was an offshoot of the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks.

The Narva has for centuries been an important border river. Beginning in the 13th century it was the border of Medieval Livonia and the Novgorod Republic. Though in earlier periods Narva was part of a larger buffer zone between the two territories, gradually the river emerged as the exact border. Castles built on the river banks (Narva Hermann Castle, founded at the beginning of the 14th century, Ivangorod fortress, established in 1492 and Vasknarva Castle, first built in the 14th century) were one of the main reasons behind this. Treaties from the 15th century between the Livonian Order and Novgorod Republic, later Tsardom of Russia, also recognize the Narva as the border. In the 17th century during the time of Swedish Estonia, when Ingria was also part of Sweden, the importance of the river as a border diminished. During the Russian Empire, from the end of the Great Northern War until the establishment of the Republic of Estonia in 1918, the Narva was the border of Governorate of Estonia and Saint Petersburg Governorate, with the exception of the town of Narva, which was part of the latter. By the Treaty of Tartu, signed in 1920, the Estonian–Russian border went slightly east of the river, up to , and, in particular, the town of Ivangorod was assigned to Estonia. In 1944 the former Estonian territory east of the river was transferred to Russian SFSR and the Narva was thus established as the eastern border of Estonian SSR, an internal border within USSR. In 1991 the same border became the &quot;de facto&quot; border of Estonia and Russia. Although no official border treaty has been ratified since then, today the Narva is the eastern border of the European Union and Schengen Zone.

===Bridges===

The Narva River is crossed only by a handful of bridges between Narva and Ivangorod. Besides the dam of the Narva Reservoir, these are, in downstream order:
* a pedestrian bridge below the Kreenholm island
* : Carrying the Tallinn–Saint Petersburg railway line.
* Friendship Bridge: The Tallinn–Saint Petersburg highway bridge on E20 just downstream from the Hermann Castle and Ivangorod Fortress. It was built in 1960 and is long.

<doc id="602454" wikidata="Q7342201" url="?curid=602454" title="Robert Bonfiglio">
<text>Robert Bonfiglio (born September 6, 1950) is an American classical harmonica player. Described by the music critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, as &quot;the Paganini of the harmonica&quot;, he is known for his many recordings and live performances featuring the instrument.

==Early life and education==
Bonfiglio was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son an orthopedic surgeon, and raised in Iowa City, Iowa. He first began playing the diatonic harmonica when he was thirteen, and although he played in local blues bands as a teenager, had no plans to become a professional musician. He enrolled in the University of Arizona to study chemistry, but at the same time became interested in the possibilities of the chromatic harmonica. After travelling to Trossingen, Germany, in the 1970s where he attended a seminar by the master harmonica player, Cham-Ber Huang, he decided on a musical career. He enrolled in Mannes College of Music in New York City, studying composition. Mannes, like the other major music conservatories in the United States at the time, did not offer majors in the harmonica. However, Bonfiglio also studied the classical harmonica with Cham-Ber Huang for five years and was coached privately by Andrew Loyla, the Principal Flautist with the New York City Ballet orchestra for over ten years. During this time he added all the existing classical music composed for the harmonica to his repertoire. After receiving his Bachelor of Music from Mannes, Bonfiglio went to post-graduate study at the Manhattan School of Music. It was his composition teacher there, Charles Wuorinen, who told him he could do more with the classical harmonica than with composition because it was such a special niche.

<text>In cryptanalysis, gardening is the act of encouraging a target to use known plaintext in an encrypted message, typically by performing some action the target is sure to report. It was a term used during World War II at the British Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, England, for schemes to entice the Germans to include particular words, which the British called &quot;cribs&quot;, in their encrypted messages. This term presumably came from RAF minelaying missions, or &quot;gardening&quot; sorties. &quot;Gardening&quot; was standard RAF slang for sowing mines in rivers, ports and oceans from low heights, possibly because each sea area around the European coasts was given a code-name of flowers or vegetables.

The technique is claimed to have been most effective against messages produced by the German Navy&#x27;s Enigma machines. If the Germans had recently swept a particular area for mines, and analysts at Bletchley Park were in need of some cribs, they might (and apparently did on several occasions) request that the area be mined again. This would hopefully evoke encrypted messages from the local command mentioning &quot;Minen&quot; (German for mines), the location, and perhaps messages also from the headquarters with minesweeping ships to assign to that location, mentioning the same. It worked often enough to try several times.

This crib-based decryption is usually not considered a chosen-plaintext attack, even though plain text effectively chosen by the British was injected into the ciphertext, because the choice was very limited and the cryptanalysts did not care what the crib was so long as they knew it. Most chosen-plaintext cryptanalysis requires very specific patterns (e.g. long repetitions of &quot;AAA...&quot;, &quot;BBB...&quot;, &quot;CCC...&quot;, etc.) which could not be mistaken for normal messages. It does, however, show that the boundary between these two is somewhat fuzzy.

Another notable example occurred during the lead up to the Battle of Midway. U.S. cryptanalysts had decrypted numerous Japanese messages about a planned operation at &quot;AF&quot;, but the code word &quot;AF&quot; came from a second location code book which was not known. Suspecting it was Midway island, they arranged for the garrison there to report in the clear about a breakdown of their desalination plant. A Japanese report about &quot;AF&quot; being short of fresh water soon followed, confirming the guess.

<text>Zakes Makgona Mokae (5 August 1934 – 11 September 2009) was a South African stage and screen actor. He was well known for his work with playwright Athol Fugard, notably in &quot;The Blood Knot&quot; and &quot;&quot;Master Harold&quot;...and the Boys&quot;, the latter earning him a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play.

==Biography==
Mokae was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, moved to the United Kingdom in 1961, and to the United States in 1969. 

Originally a jazz saxophonist in Trevor Huddleston&#x27;s band, he turned to acting at the same time as playwright Athol Fugard was emerging. The two worked together on Fugard&#x27;s play, &quot;Blood Knot&quot;, from 1961, a two-hander set in South Africa about brothers with the same mother but different fathers; Zach (played by Mokae) is dark skinned and Morris (played by Fugard) is fair skinned. Later Mokae worked with Fugard on the play &quot;&quot;Master Harold&quot;...and the Boys&quot;, for which Mokae won the 1982 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play. The play was filmed for television in 1985 with Mokae and Matthew Broderick. In 1993 Mokae was nominated for a second Tony Award for Featured Actor in a Play for &quot;The Song of Jacob Zulu&quot; by Tug Yourgrau.

His early film roles included &quot;Darling&quot; (1965) as a guest at a wild party, and &quot;The Comedians&quot; (1967) starring Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. His major films are split between anti-apartheid films such as &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; (1987) and &quot;A Dry White Season&quot; (1989), and cult horror films such as &quot;The Island&quot; (1980), &quot;Dust Devil&quot; (1993), &quot;The Serpent and the Rainbow&quot; (1988) and &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot; (1995), the latter two directed by horror icon Wes Craven. He also appeared in character roles in many other films including &quot;Gross Anatomy&quot; (1989), &quot;Dad&quot; (1989), &quot;A Rage in Harlem&quot; (1991), &quot;Outbreak&quot; (1995) and the Kevin Costner film &quot;Waterworld&quot; (1995). On television, he has been a guest actor in many series such as &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Oz&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot; and &quot;Knight Rider&quot;.

In 1975, American writer–filmmaker Eon Chontay Cjohnathan gave birth to Zakes Mokae&#x27;s only child, Santlo (after Mokae&#x27;s mother) Chontay Mokae.

In later years, Mokae worked as a theatre director for American companies including the Nevada Shakespeare Company. Mokae died from complications of a stroke on 11 September 2009 in Las Vegas.

<doc id="602461" wikidata="Q2302473" url="?curid=602461" title="University of Crete">
<text>The University of Crete (UoC; Greek: Πανεπιστήμιο Κρήτης) is a multi-disciplinary, research-oriented institution in Crete, Greece, located in the cities of Rethymno (official seat) and Heraklion.

There are 16 main undergraduate degree programmes corresponding to the university&#x27;s departments and more than 30 master&#x27;s programmes.

As of 2017, there is a student population of 16.000 registered undergraduates and 2.500 registered postgraduates, more than 500 Faculty members as well as approximately 420 administrative staff.

==Overview==
The University of Crete was established in 1973 and started functioning in the academic year 1977–78.

As with all universities in Greece, the University of Crete is a public university and as such it operates under the supervision of the state and all its educational activities, as well as a part of its research activities, rely upon government funding. The supreme administrative body of the university is the Senate, which is presided over by the rector of the university. The head of the university is the rector, who is assisted by three vice-rectors in the exercise of his duties; all four together form the institution&#x27;s high authority. They are elected for a period of four years by the teaching staff and representatives of the student body.

Although still very young, the University of Crete has already shown its commitment in the evolving process of European integration, and it operates as an integral member of the European Research and Education Areas. It is currently coordinating and participating in European Union programs and activities such as ERASMUS, LINGUA, and TEMPUS and has important links and cooperations with other Mediterranean and Eastern European countries as well as with many American universities and colleges, through international programmes.

The university encourages active participation in cultural and athletic activities. The student union also operates a radio station.

==Emblem==
The emblem of the University of Crete is based on a Hellenistic coin found in Gortyn (430–300 BC) and depicts Europa in reflective stance while sitting on olive tree branches. The emblem was designed in a medal by the sculptor Aspasia Papadoperaki.

== Faculties and departments ==
The university has sixteen departments organised in five schools according to related disciplines.

Its two campuses are located near two towns on the north coast of the island, Galos in Rethymno and Voutes in Heraklion.

==Research==
The University of Crete is well known both nationally and internationally for its state-of-the-art research and graduate programmes.

Research and research training in Crete benefits from an academic and technological environment of international standards, built up over the last 40 years through the cluster of research-oriented institutions in the region. These provide a critical mass of expertise in AHSS as well as STEM disciplines and access to excellent complementary facilities for research and research training in highly competitive fields and interaction with industry partners.

It is considered one of the best universities in Greece mainly due to its research influence: it ranks in the top 400 Universities of the World by the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; (THE) list, and also in the top 100 universities under 50 years by the QS World University Rankings.

On several research topics the University of Crete collaborates closely with FO.R.T.H.

<text>KCSN (88.5 FM, &quot;88.5 The SoCal Sound&quot;) is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed to Northridge, California, and owned by California State University, Northridge. The station simulcasts with KSBR from Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. The station primarily airs adult album alternative (AAA) and Americana music with a mix of legends, new music, and local music with some specialty programming on weekends.

KSBR simulcasts this station on 88.5 FM in Orange County.

==History==
KCSN came to air as KEDC-FM in late 1963. The station signed on with 10 watts, using a transmitter donated by Saul Levine, and broadcast four hours a day of jazz and classical music, in addition to hourly news bulletins produced by San Fernando Valley State College journalism students. Power was increased to 320 watts in 1967 and 3,000 watts in 1970. The 1970 power increase shut out a proposal by the Mexican-American Communication Foundation to build a station on the frequency in East Los Angeles. It became KCSN on February 1, 1973, months after the school became California State University, Northridge; the station was known as &quot;Radio Free Northridge&quot; since 1971.

Beginning in 1987, KCSN aired an all-country format, &quot;Kissin&#x27; Country&quot; (a play on how the call letters &quot;KCSN&quot; might be pronounced). The format switch was controversial, earning the station additional donations but alienating it from its student body base. The station also took fire from students who worried that they had less and less of a role in its operation as professional staff were added, in part because KCSN received Corporation for Public Broadcasting grants. In November 1989, two months after classical music station KFAC-FM (92.3) was sold to Evergreen Media and flipped to a &quot;rock with a beat&quot; format, KCSN made a play for those listeners and went all-classical, drawing the ire of the country fans.
As a classical station, KCSN also aired specialty shows on weekends and in late night. As the &quot;Best of Public Radio,&quot; KCSN&#x27;s specialty shows were devoted to German music, Broadway showtunes, children&#x27;s music, soundtrack music, hip-hop, Hawaiian music, blues, folk, the Beatles, surf music, cocktail tunes, electronic music, and more.

KCSN went to an automated adult album alternative (AAA) format from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in 2008, removing most of the specialty shows.

===&quot;Smart rock&quot;===
On March 1, 2010, KCSN moved all classical music from its primary FM signal to its HD2 channel. The main FM/HD1 channel was switched to an all-AAA programming format without news.

Under the guidance of radio and record company veteran Sky Daniels, some of Los Angeles radio&#x27;s legendary hosts were hired to host shows on KCSN, including former KCRW host Nic Harcourt; Mark Sovel, the founding music director of Indie 103.1; long-time KROQ host Jed the Fish; and Robert Hilburn, the thirty-year Music Editor for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

In the same time period, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers played two small-hall benefit concerts for the station. Subsequently, Jackson Browne, The Rides, Ryan Adams, Conor Oberst, David Gray, Sarah McLachlan, and Bonnie Raitt performed at the station&#x27;s annual benefit concerts. Sting also premiered new songs from the station in August 2016.

Harcourt, who stewarded KCRW&#x27;s &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot; to international recognition, hosts the 6-10 am slot, which he sometimes refers to on-air as &quot;Mornings Are Electric.&quot; KCSN is also the L.A. radio partner of &quot;World Cafe&quot;, the program hosted by Raina Douris of WXPN/Philadelphia.

KCSN also supports local music in the Los Angeles market. Kevin Bronson, the director of Buzzbands L.A., has a show devoted to supporting local musicians. The station&#x27;s new music library typically is represented with local artists by upwards of 30% of the playlist. KCSN has a roster of shows that include AAA, Americana, and blues genres.

KCSN also supports music by hosting live music sessions and interviews with new, local, and legendary artists, the majority recorded by audio engineers Tristan Dolce and Matt Blake.

KCSN&#x27;s studios are located in the Valley Performing Arts Center on the CSUN campus. The station also opened a satellite studio at The Village at Westfield Topanga in October 2015.

===&quot;The New 88.5 FM&quot; and The SoCal Sound===
On September 6, 2017, California State University, Northridge and Saddleback College, owner of Mission Viejo–based KSBR, announced the merger of their respective radio stations. The combined operation adopted the branding &quot;The New 88.5 FM&quot;. On September 12 at 10 a.m. PDT, the FM and HD1 signals of both stations began simulcasting KCSN&#x27;s pre-existing &quot;smart rock&quot; AAA format, while KSBR&#x27;s jazz programming would move to their HD2 channels. KCSN&#x27;s Latin Alternative relocated to both stations&#x27; HD3 channels.

On March 21, 2018, 88.5 FM announced that former KSWD (100.3 The Sound) radio personality Andy Chanley would host afternoon drive, taking over for Sky Daniels who continued as General Manager and Program Director. Prior to this, Chanley had guest hosted in Daniels&#x27; place for several weeks since January.

On August 18, 2022, it was announced that KCSN would change its branding to &quot;88.5 The SoCal Sound&quot; on August 19.

==HD programming==
In October 2013, the HD2 channel dropped classical and launched a new format known as Latin alternative, which includes Latin pop, modern rock, classic rock, hip-hop dance music and salsoul. 
. This format then moved to HD3 as part of the KSBR programming partnership as KSBR&#x27;s Jazz programming moved to HD2.

KCSN also mentors California State University, Northridge students in broadcasting, music industry, audio engineering and news production. Students produce six-minute morning news segments that air at 6:30am and 7:30am and three-minute segments at 7am and 8am. A nightly half-hour news program called the &quot;Evening Update&quot; airs at 6pm.

The news department of KCSN has received almost 500 news awards under the leadership of Keith Goldstein, who died in 2016.

These news programs are heard on the HD3 channel.

<doc id="602466" wikidata="Q1362721" url="?curid=602466" title="Tuberous sclerosis">
<text>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disease that causes non-cancerous tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, liver, eyes, lungs and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, lung disease, and kidney disease.

TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, &quot;TSC1&quot; and &quot;TSC2&quot;, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively, with &quot;TSC2&quot; mutations accounting for the majority and tending to cause more severe symptoms. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.

Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the symptoms, but life expectancy is normal for many.

The prevalence of the disease is estimated to be 7 to 12 in 100,000. The disease is often abbreviated to tuberous sclerosis, which refers to the hard swellings in the brains of patients, first described by French neurologist Désiré-Magloire Bourneville in 1880.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The physical manifestations of TSC are due to the formation of hamartia (malformed tissue such as the cortical tubers), hamartomas (benign growths such as facial angiofibroma and subependymal nodules), and very rarely, cancerous hamartoblastomas. The effect of these on the brain leads to neurological symptoms such as seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and behavioral problems.

===Neurological===

Three types of brain tumours are associated with TSC:
* Giant cell astrocytoma: (grows and blocks the cerebrospinal fluid flow, leading to dilatation of ventricles causing headache and vomiting)
* Cortical tubers: after which the disease is named
* Subependymal nodules: form in the walls of ventricles

Classic intracranial manifestations of TSC include subependymal nodules and cortical/subcortical tubers.

The tubers are typically triangular in configuration, with the apex pointed towards the ventricles, and are thought to represent foci of abnormal neuronal migration. The T2 signal abnormalities may subside in adulthood, but will still be visible on histopathological analysis. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), TSC patients can exhibit other signs consistent with abnormal neuron migration such as radial white matter tracts hyperintense on T2WI and heterotopic grey matter.

Subependymal nodules are composed of abnormal, swollen glial cells and bizarre multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial or neuronal origin. Interposed neural tissue is not present. These nodules have a tendency to calcify as the patient ages. A nodule that markedly enhances and enlarges over time should be considered suspicious for transformation into a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, which typically develops in the region of the foramen of Monro, in which case it is at risk of developing an obstructive hydrocephalus.

A variable degree of ventricular enlargement is seen, either obstructive (e.g. by a subependymal nodule in the region of the foramen of Monro) or idiopathic in nature.
=== Neuropsychiatric ===
About 90% of people with TSC develop a range of neurodevelopmental, behavioural, psychiatric, and psychosocial difficulties. The &quot;TSC‐associated neuropsychiatric disorders&quot; are abbreviated TAND. These difficulties are less frequently identified and thus undertreated when compared with the neurological symptoms. Most problems are associated with more severe intellectual delay or associated with childhood and adolescence, and some (for example depressed mood) may be unreported if the person is unable to communicate. TAND can be investigated and considered at six levels: behavioural, psychiatric, intellectual, academic, neuropsychological, and psychosocial.

Behavioural problems most commonly seen include overactivity, impulsivity and sleeping difficulties. Also common are anxiety, mood swings, and severe aggression. Less common are depressed mood, self-injury, and compulsive behaviours.

People with TSC are frequently also diagnosed with psychiatric disorders: autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder and depressive disorder. TSC is one of the most common genetic causes of autism spectrum disorder, which affects nearly half of people with TSC. ASD is more common in TSC2 than TSC1 and more common with earlier and more severe epilepsy, and with lower intellectual ability. ADHD is nearly as frequently seen in TSC as ASD (up to half of all people with TSC). Anxiety and depressive disorders, when they occur, are typically diagnosed in early adulthood and among those intellectually able to express their moods.

The intellectual ability of people with TSC varies enormously. About 40–50% have a normal IQ. A normal IQ is much more commonly seen in TSC1 than TSC2, and profound intellectual disability seen in 34% of TSC2 compared with 10% of TSC1 in one study. Many studies have examined whether early onset, type and severity of epilepsy associates with intellectual ability. Academic issues occur even in people with TSC who have normal intellectual ability. These are often specific learning disorders such as dyscalculia (understanding mathematics), but also include other aspects affecting school life such as anxiety, lack of social skills or low self-esteem.

About half of people with TSC, when assessed for neuropsychological skills, are in the bottom 5th percentile in some areas, which indicates a severe impairment. These include problems with attention (for example, being able to concentrate on two separate things like looking and listening), memory (particularly recall, verbal and spatial working memory) and executive function (for example, planning, self-monitoring, cognitive flexibility).

The psychosocial impacts of TSC include low self-esteem and self-efficacy in the individual, and a burden on the family coping with a complex and unpredictable disorder.

=== Kidneys ===

Between 26% and 80% of TSC patients have benign tumors of the kidneys called angiomyolipomas, with hematuria being the most frequent presenting symptom. TSC angiomyolipomas differ from non-TSC angiomyolipomas in age of presentation (31.5 years vs 53.6 years), mean tumor size (8.2 cm vs 4.5 cm), and percentage of cases requiring surgical intervention (50% vs 28%). Although benign, an angiomyolipoma larger than 4 cm is at risk for a potentially catastrophic hemorrhage, either spontaneously or with minimal trauma.

=== Lungs ===
Patients with TSC can develop progressive replacement of the lung parenchyma with multiple cysts, known as lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Recent genetic analysis has shown that the proliferative bronchiolar smooth muscle in TSC-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis is monoclonal metastasis from a coexisting renal angiomyolipoma. Cases of TSC-related lymphangioleiomyomatosis recurring following lung transplant have been reported.

=== Heart ===
Small tumours of the heart muscle, called cardiac rhabdomyomas, are rare in the general population (perhaps 0.2% of children) but very common in people with TSC. Around 80% of children under two-years-old with TSC have at least one rhabdomyoma, and about 90% of those will have several. The vast majority of children with at least one rhabdomyoma, and nearly all children with multiple rhabdomyomas will be found to have TSC. Prenatal ultrasound, performed by an obstetric sonographer specializing in cardiology, can detect a rhabdomyoma after 20 weeks. Rhabdomyoma vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres, and are usually found in the lower chambers (ventricles) and less often in the upper chambers (atria). They grow in size during the second half of pregnancy, but regress after birth, and are seen in only around 20% of children over two years old.

Most rhabdomyomas cause no problems but some may cause heart failure in the foetus or first year of life. Rhabdomyomas are believed to be responsible for the development of heart arrhythmia later in life, which is relatively common in TSC. Arrhythmia can be hard to spot in people with TSC, other than by performing routine ECG. For example, arrhythmia may cause fainting that is confused with drop seizures, and symptoms of arrhythmia such as palpitations may not be reported in an individual with developmental delay.

=== Skin ===
Some form of dermatological sign is present in 96% of individuals with TSC. Most cause no problems, but are helpful in diagnosis. Some cases may cause disfigurement, necessitating treatment. The most common skin abnormalities include:
* Hypomelanic macules (&quot;ash leaf spots&quot;) are present in about 90% of people with TSC. These small white or lighter patches of skin may appear anywhere on the body, and are caused by a lack of melanin. They are usually the only visible sign of TSC at birth. In fair-skinned individuals, a Wood&#x27;s lamp (ultraviolet light) may be required to see them. On the scalp, the effect may be a white patch of hair (poliosis). Patches smaller than 3mm are known as &quot;confetti&quot; skin lesions.
* Facial angiofibromas are present in about 75% of people with TSC. These are a rash of reddish spots or bumps on the nose and cheeks in a butterfly distribution, which consist of blood vessels and fibrous tissue. This potentially socially embarrassing rash starts to appear during childhood.
* Ungual fibromas: Also known as Koenen&#x27;s tumors, these are small fleshy tumors that grow around and under the toenails or fingernails. These are rare in childhood, but common by middle age. They are generally more common on toes than on fingers, develop at 15–29 years, and are more common in women than in men.
* Fibrous cephalic plaques are present in about 25% of people with TSC. These are raised, discoloured areas usually found on the forehead, but sometimes on the face or elsewhere on the scalp.
* Shagreen patches are present in about half of people with TSC, appearing in childhood. They are areas of thick leathery skin that are dimpled like an orange peel, and pigmented, they are usually found on the lower back or nape of the neck, or scattered across the trunk or thighs. The frequency of these lesions rises with age.
* Dental enamel pits are found in almost all adults with TSC.
* Intraoral fibromas are small surface-tumours found in the gums, inside the cheeks or tongue. Gum (gingival) fibromas are found in about 20-50% of people with TSC, more commonly in adults.

=== Eyes ===
Retinal lesions, called astrocytic hamartomas (or &quot;phakomas&quot;), which appear as a greyish or yellowish-white lesion in the back of the globe on the ophthalmic examination. Astrocytic hamartomas can calcify, and they are in the differential diagnosis of a calcified globe mass on a CT scan.

Nonretinal lesions associated with TSC include:
* Coloboma
* Angiofibromas of the eyelids
* Papilledema (related to hydrocephalus)

=== Pancreas ===
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours have been described in rare cases of TSC.

=== Variability ===
Individuals with TSC may experience none or all of the clinical signs discussed above. The following table shows the prevalence of some of the clinical signs in individuals diagnosed with TSC.
== Genetics ==

TSC is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance. Two-thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them. Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in roughly 20% of individuals diagnosed with the disease. So far, it has been mapped to two genetic loci, &quot;TSC1&quot; and &quot;TSC2&quot;.

&quot;TSC1&quot; encodes for the protein hamartin, is located on chromosome 9 q34, and was discovered in 1997. &quot;TSC2&quot; encodes for the protein tuberin, is located on chromosome 16 p13.3, and was discovered in 1993. &quot;TSC2&quot; is contiguous with &quot;PKD1&quot;, the gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the 2% of individuals with TSC who also develop polycystic kidney disease in childhood. &quot;TSC2&quot; has been associated with a more severe form of TSC. However, the difference is subtle and cannot be used to identify the mutation clinically. Estimates of the proportion of TSC caused by &quot;TSC2&quot; range from 55% to 90%.

&quot;TSC1&quot; and &quot;TSC2&quot; are both tumor suppressor genes that function according to Knudson&#x27;s &quot;two hit&quot; hypothesis. That is, a second random mutation must occur before a tumor can develop. This explains why, despite its high penetrance, TSC has wide expressivity.
== Pathophysiology ==
Hamartin and tuberin function as a complex which is involved in the control of cell growth and cell division. The complex appears to interact with RHEB GTPase, thus sequestering it from activating mTOR signalling, part of the growth factor (insulin) signalling pathway. Thus, mutations at the &quot;TSC1&quot; and &quot;TSC2&quot; loci result in a loss of control of cell growth and cell division, and therefore a predisposition to forming tumors. TSC affects tissues from different germ layers. Cutaneous and visceral lesions may occur, including angiofibroma, cardiac rhabdomyomas, and renal angiomyolipomas. The central nervous system lesions seen in this disorder include hamartomas of the cortex, hamartomas of the ventricular walls, and subependymal giant cell tumors, which typically develop in the vicinity of the foramina of Monro.

Molecular genetic studies have defined at least two loci for TSC. In &quot;TSC1&quot;, the abnormality is localized on chromosome 9q34, but the nature of the gene protein, called hamartin, remains unclear. No missense mutations occur in &quot;TSC1&quot;. In &quot;TSC2&quot;, the gene abnormalities are on chromosome 16p13. This gene encodes tuberin, a guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein. The specific function of this protein is unknown. In &quot;TSC2&quot;, all types of mutations have been reported; new mutations occur frequently. Few differences have yet been observed in the clinical phenotypes of patients with mutation of one gene or the other.

Cells from individuals with pathogenic mutations in the TSC2 gene display abnormal accumulation of glycogen that is associated with depletion of lysosomes and autophagic impairment. The defective degradation of glycogen by the autophagy-lysosome pathway is, at least in part, independent of impaired regulation of mTORC1 and is restored, in cultured cells, by the combined use of PKB/Akt and mTORC1 pharmacological inhibitors.

== Diagnosis ==
Tuberous sclerosis complex is diagnosed with clinical and genetic tests. There are many different mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes that have been identified in individuals with TSC. A pathogenic mutation in the gene prevents the proteins from being made or inactivates the proteins. If such a pathogenic mutation is found then this alone is sufficient to diagnose TSC. However, some mutations are less clear in their effect, and so not sufficient alone for diagnosis. Between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4 of individuals with TSC have no mutation that can be identified. Once a particular mutation is identified in someone with TSC, this mutation can be used to make confident diagnoses in other family members.

For clinical diagnosis, there isn&#x27;t one sign that is unique (pathognomonic) to TSC, nor are all signs seen in all individuals. Therefore, several signs are considered together, classed as either major or minor features. An individual with two major features, or one major feature and at least two minor features can be given a definite diagnosis of TSC. If only one major feature or at least two minor features are present, the diagnosis is only regarded as possibly TSC.

TSC can be first diagnosed at any stage of life. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by chance if heart tumours are discovered during routine ultrasound. In infancy, epilepsy, particularly infantile spasms, or developmental delay may lead to neurological tests. The white patches on the skin may also first become noticed. In childhood, behavioural problems and autism spectrum disorder may provoke a diagnosis. During adolescence, the skin problems appear. In adulthood, kidney and lung problems may develop. An individual may also be diagnosed at any time as a result of genetic testing of family members of another affected person.

== Management ==

Tuberous sclerosis complex affects multiple organ systems so a multidisciplinary team of medical professionals is required.

In suspected or newly diagnosed TSC, the following tests and procedures are recommended by 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference.
* Take a personal and family history covering three generations. Genetic counselling and tests determine if other individuals are at risk.
* A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to identify tubers, subependymal nodules (SEN) and sub-ependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGA).
* Children undergo a baseline electroencephalograph (EEG) and family educated to identify seizures if/when they occur.
* Assess children for behavioural issues, autism spectrum disorder, psychiatric disorders, developmental delay, and neuropsychological problems.
* Scan the abdomen for tumours in various organs, but most importantly angiomyolipomata in the kidneys. MRI is superior to CT or ultrasound. Take blood pressure and test renal function.
* In adult women, test pulmonary function and perform a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest.
* Examine the skin under a Wood&#x27;s lamp (hypomelanotic macules), the fingers and toes (ungual fibroma), the face (angiofibromas), and the mouth (dental pits and gingival fibromas).
* In infants under three, perform an echocardiogram to spot rhabdomyomas, and electrocardiogram (ECG) for any arrhythmia.
* Use a fundoscope to spot retinal hamartomas or achromic patches.

The various symptoms and complications from TSC may appear throughout life, requiring continued surveillance and adjustment to treatments. The following ongoing tests and procedures are recommended by 2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference.
* In children and adults younger than 25 years, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is performed every one to three years to monitor for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA). If a SEGA is large, growing or interfering with ventricles, the MRI is performed more frequently. After 25 years, if there are no SEGAs then periodic scans may no longer be required. A SEGA causing acute symptoms are removed with surgery, otherwise either surgery or drug treatment with an mTOR inhibitor may be indicated.
* Repeat screening for TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) at least annually. Sudden behavioural changes may indicate a new physical problem (for example with the kidneys, epilepsy or a SEGA).
* Routine EEG determined by clinical need.
* Infantile spasms are best treated with vigabatrin and adrenocorticotropic hormone used as a second-line therapy. Other seizure types have no TSC-specific recommendation, though epilepsy in TSC is typically difficult to treat (medically refractory).
* Repeat MRI of abdomen every one to three years throughout life. Check renal (kidney) function annually. Should angiomyolipoma bleed, this is best treated with embolisation and then corticosteroids. Removal of the kidney (nephrectomy) is strongly to be avoided. An asymptomatic angiomyolipoma that is growing larger than 3 cm is best treated with an mTOR inhibitor drug. Other renal complications spotted by imaging include polycystic kidney disease and renal cell carcinoma.
* Repeat chest HRCT in adult women every five to 10 years. Evidence of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) indicates more frequent testing. An mTOR inhibitor drug can help, though a lung transplant may be required.
* A 12-lead ECG should be performed every three to five years.

The mTOR inhibitor everolimus was approved in the US for treatment of TSC-related tumors in the brain (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 2010 and in the kidneys (renal angiomyolipoma) in 2012.  Oral everolimus (rapalog) reduces tumour size, is effective in terms of response to skin lesions and does not increase the risk of adverse events. Everolimus also showed evidence of effectiveness at treating epilepsy in some people with TSC. In 2017, the European Commission approved everolimus for treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures associated with TSC.

Neurosurgical intervention may reduce the severity and frequency of seizures in TSC patients. Embolization and other surgical interventions can be used to treat renal angiomyolipoma with acute hemorrhage. Surgical treatments for symptoms of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in adult TSC patients include pleurodesis to prevent pneumothorax and lung transplantation in the case of irreversible lung failure.

Other treatments that have been used to treat TSC manifestations and symptoms include a ketogenic diet for intractable epilepsy and pulmonary rehabilitation for LAM. Facial angiofibromas can be reduced with laser treatment and the effectiveness of mTOR inhibitor topical treatment is being investigated. Laser therapy is painful, requires anaesthesia, and has risks of scarring and dyspigmentation.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for individuals with TSC depends on the severity of symptoms, which range from mild skin abnormalities to varying degrees of learning disabilities and epilepsy to severe intellectual disability, uncontrollable seizures, and kidney failure. Those individuals with mild symptoms generally do well and live long, productive lives, while individuals with the more severe form may have serious disabilities. However, with appropriate medical care, most individuals with the disorder can look forward to normal life expectancy.

A study of 30 TSC patients in Egypt found, &quot;...earlier age of seizures commencement (&lt;6 months) is associated with poor seizure outcome and poor intellectual capabilities. Infantile spasms and severely epileptogenic EEG patterns are related to the poor seizure outcome, poor intellectual capabilities and autistic behavior. Higher tubers numbers is associated with poor seizure outcome and autistic behavior. Left-sided tuber burden is associated with poor intellect, while frontal location is more encountered in ASD [autism spectrum disorders]. So, close follow up for the mental development and early control of seizures are recommended in a trial to reduce the risk factors of poor outcome. Also early diagnosis of autism will allow for earlier treatment and the potential for better outcome for children with TSC.&quot;

Leading causes of death include renal disease, brain tumour, lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the lung, and status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia in those with severe intellectual disability. Cardiac failure due to rhabdomyomas is a risk in the fetus or neonate but is rarely a problem subsequently. Kidney complications such as angiomyolipoma and cysts are common and more frequent in females than males and in &quot;TSC2&quot; than &quot;TSC1&quot;. Renal cell carcinoma is uncommon. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is only a risk for females with angiomyolipomas. In the brain, the subependymal nodules occasionally degenerate to subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. These may block the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid around the brain, leading to hydrocephalus.

Detection of the disease should be followed by genetic counselling. It is also important to realize that though the disease does not have a cure, symptoms can be treated symptomatically. Hence, awareness regarding different organ manifestations of TSC is important.

== Epidemiology ==
TSC occurs in all races and ethnic groups, and in both sexes. The live-birth prevalence is estimated to be between 10 and 16 cases per 100,000. A 1998 study estimated total population prevalence between about 7 and 12 cases per 100,000, with more than half of these cases undetected. Prior to the invention of CT scanning to identify the nodules and tubers in the brain, the prevalence was thought to be much lower, and the disease associated with those people diagnosed clinically with learning disability, seizures and facial angiofibroma. Whilst still regarded as a rare disease, TSC is common when compared to many other genetic diseases, with at least 1 million individuals affected worldwide.

== History ==
TSC first came to medical attention when dermatologists described the distinctive facial rash (1835 and 1850). A more complete case was presented by von Recklinghausen (1862), who identified heart and brain tumours in a newborn who had only briefly lived. However, Bourneville (1880) is credited with having first characterized the disease, coining the name &quot;tuberous sclerosis&quot;, thus earning the eponym Bourneville&#x27;s disease. The neurologist Vogt (1908) established a diagnostic triad of epilepsy, idiocy, and adenoma sebaceum (an obsolete term for facial angiofibroma).

Symptoms were periodically added to the clinical picture. The disease as presently understood was first fully described by Gomez (1979). The invention of medical ultrasound, CT and MRI has allowed physicians to examine the internal organs of live patients and greatly improved diagnostic ability.
In 2002, treatment with rapamycin was found to be effective at shrinking tumours in animals. This has led to human trials of rapamycin as a drug to treat several of the tumors associated with TSC.

<text>Gaëtan de Grimaudet, comte de Rochebouët (; 16 March 1813 – 23 February 1899) was a French general who served as Prime Minister for less than a month in late 1877.

On 29 June 1877, Patrice de MacMahon dissolved the Chamber of Deputies after losing a vote on the freedom of the press. The resulting elections of 14 October 1877 were a victory for Republicans, who won a majority of seats. President MacMahon at first attempted to resist the result. He asked General Rochebouët to form a &quot;department of business&quot;, with which the House refused to deal: Rochebouët resigned only 20 days after his appointment. MacMahon decided to accept the conditions of Jules Dufaure, forming a new, left of center government.

==Rochebouët&#x27;s Ministry, 23 November 1877 – 13 December 1877==

* Gaëtan de Grimaudet de Rochebouët – President of the Council and Minister of War
* Marquis de Banneville – Minister of Foreign Affairs
* Charles Welche – Minister of the Interior
* François Dutilleul – Minister of Finance
* François Le Pelletier – Minister of Justice
* Albert Roussin – Minister of Marine and Colonies
