<text>In computer science and operations research, the ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems that can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants represent multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants.
The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used. Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a preferred method for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.

As an example, ant colony optimization is a class of optimization algorithms modeled on the actions of an ant colony. Artificial &#x27;ants&#x27; (e.g. simulation agents) locate optimal solutions by moving through a parameter space representing all possible solutions. Real ants lay down pheromones to direct each other to resources while exploring their environment. The simulated &#x27;ants&#x27; similarly record their positions and the quality of their solutions, so that in later simulation iterations more ants locate better solutions. One variation on this approach is the bees algorithm, which is more analogous to the foraging patterns of the honey bee, another social insect.

This algorithm is a member of the ant colony algorithms family, in swarm intelligence methods, and it constitutes some metaheuristic optimizations. Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 in his PhD thesis, the first algorithm was aiming to search for an optimal path in a graph, based on the behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and a source of food. The original idea has since diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems, and as a result, several problems have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the behavior of ants. From a broader perspective, ACO performs a model-based search and shares some similarities with estimation of distribution algorithms.

==Overview==

In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely to stop travelling at random and instead follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication).

Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, is marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.

The overall result is that when one ant finds a good (i.e., short) path from the colony to a food source, other ants are more likely to follow that path, and positive feedback eventually leads to many ants following a single path. The idea of the ant colony algorithm is to mimic this behavior with &quot;simulated ants&quot; walking around the graph representing the problem to be solved.

===Ambient networks of intelligent objects===
New concepts are required since “intelligence” is no longer centralized but can be found throughout all minuscule objects. Anthropocentric concepts have been known to lead to the production of IT systems in which data processing, control units and calculating power are centralized. These centralized units have continually increased their performance and can be compared to the human brain. The model of the brain has become the ultimate vision of computers. Ambient networks of intelligent objects and, sooner or later, a new generation of information systems that are even more diffused and based on nanotechnology, will profoundly change this concept. Small devices that can be compared to insects do not possess a high intelligence on their own. Indeed, their intelligence can be classed as fairly limited. It is, for example, impossible to integrate a high performance calculator with the power to solve any kind of mathematical problem into a biochip that is implanted into the human body or integrated in an intelligent tag designed to trace commercial articles. However, once those objects are interconnected they develop a form of intelligence that can be compared to a colony of ants or bees. In the case of certain problems, this type of intelligence can be superior to the reasoning of a centralized system similar to the brain.

Nature offers several examples of how minuscule organisms, if they all follow the same basic rule, can create a form of collective intelligence on the macroscopic level. Colonies of social insects perfectly illustrate this model which greatly differs from human societies. This model is based on the cooperation of independent units with simple and unpredictable behavior. They move through their surrounding area to carry out certain tasks and only possess a very limited amount of information to do so. A colony of ants, for example, represents numerous qualities that can also be applied to a network of ambient objects. Colonies of ants have a very high capacity to adapt themselves to changes in the environment, as well as great strength in dealing with situations where one individual fails to carry out a given task. This kind of flexibility would also be very useful for mobile networks of objects which are perpetually developing. Parcels of information that move from a computer to a digital object behave in the same way as ants would do. They move through the network and pass from one node to the next with the objective of arriving at their final destination as quickly as possible.

===Artificial pheromone system===
Pheromone-based communication is one of the most effective ways of communication which is widely observed in nature. Pheromone is used by social insects such as
bees, ants and termites; both for inter-agent and agent-swarm communications. Due to its feasibility, artificial pheromones have been adopted in multi-robot and swarm robotic systems. Pheromone-based communication was implemented by different means such as chemical or physical (RFID tags, light, sound) ways. However, those implementations were not able to replicate all the aspects of pheromones as seen in nature.

Using projected light was presented in a 2007 IEEE paper by Garnier, Simon, et al. as an experimental setup to study pheromone-based communication with micro autonomous robots. Another study presented a system in which pheromones were implemented via a horizontal LCD screen on which the robots moved, with the robots having downward facing light sensors to register the patterns beneath them.

==Algorithm and formula==
In the ant colony optimization algorithms, an artificial ant is a simple computational agent that searches for good solutions to a given optimization problem. To apply an ant colony algorithm, the optimization problem needs to be converted into the problem of finding the shortest path on a weighted graph. In the first step of each iteration, each ant stochastically constructs a solution, i.e. the order in which the edges in the graph should be followed. In the second step, the paths found by the different ants are compared. The last step consists of updating the pheromone levels on each edge.

 procedure ACO_MetaHeuristic is
 while not terminated do
 generateSolutions()
 daemonActions()
 pheromoneUpdate()
 repeat
 end procedure

===Edge selection===
Each ant needs to construct a solution to move through the graph. To select the next edge in its tour, an ant will consider the length of each edge available from its current position, as well as the corresponding pheromone level. At each step of the algorithm, each ant moves from a state formula_1 to state formula_2, corresponding to a more complete intermediate solution. Thus, each ant formula_3 computes a set formula_4 of feasible expansions to its current state in each iteration, and moves to one of these in probability. For ant formula_3, the probability formula_6 of moving from state formula_1 to state formula_2 depends on the combination of two values, the &quot;attractiveness&quot; formula_9 of the move, as computed by some heuristic indicating the &quot;a priori&quot; desirability of that move and the &quot;trail level&quot; formula_10 of the move, indicating how proficient it has been in the past to make that particular move. The &quot;trail level&quot; represents a posteriori indication of the desirability of that move.

In general, the formula_3th ant moves from state formula_1 to state formula_2 with probability

:formula_14

where formula_10 is the amount of pheromone deposited for transition from state formula_1 to formula_2, formula_18 ≥ 0 is a parameter to control the influence of formula_10, formula_9 is the desirability of state transition formula_21 (&quot;a priori&quot; knowledge, typically formula_22, where formula_23 is the distance) and formula_24 ≥ 1 is a parameter to control the influence of formula_9. formula_26 and formula_27 represent the trail level and attractiveness for the other possible state transitions.

===Pheromone update===

Trails are usually updated when all ants have completed their solution, increasing or decreasing the level of trails corresponding to moves that were part of &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; solutions, respectively. An example of a global pheromone updating rule is now
:formula_28

where formula_10 is the amount of pheromone deposited for a state transition formula_21, formula_31 is the &quot;pheromone evaporation coefficient&quot;, formula_32 is the number of ants and formula_33 is the amount of pheromone deposited by formula_3th ant, typically given for a TSP problem (with moves corresponding to arcs of the graph) by

:formula_35

where formula_36 is the cost of the formula_3th ant&#x27;s tour (typically length) and formula_38 is a constant.

==Common extensions==
Here are some of the most popular variations of ACO algorithms.

===Ant system (AS)===
The ant system is the first ACO algorithm. This algorithm corresponds to the one presented above. It was developed by Dorigo.

===Ant colony system (ACS)===
In the ant colony system algorithm, the original ant system was modified in three aspects:

# The edge selection is biased towards exploitation (i.e. favoring the probability of selecting the shortest edges with a large amount of pheromone);
# While building a solution, ants change the pheromone level of the edges they are selecting by applying a local pheromone updating rule;
# At the end of each iteration, only the best ant is allowed to update the trails by applying a modified global pheromone updating rule.

===Elitist ant system===
In this algorithm, the global best solution deposits pheromone on its trail after every iteration (even if this trail has not been revisited), along with all the other ants. The elitist strategy has as its objective directing the search of all ants to construct a solution to contain links of the current best route.

===Max-min ant system (MMAS)===
This algorithm controls the maximum and minimum pheromone amounts on each trail. Only the global best tour or the iteration best tour are allowed to add pheromone to its trail. To avoid stagnation of the search algorithm, the range of possible pheromone amounts on each trail is limited to an interval [τmax,τmin]. All edges are initialized to τmax to force a higher exploration of solutions. The trails are reinitialized to τmax when nearing stagnation.

===Rank-based ant system (ASrank)===
All solutions are ranked according to their length. Only a fixed number of the best ants in this iteration are allowed to update their trials. The amount of pheromone deposited is weighted for each solution, such that solutions with shorter paths deposit more pheromone than the solutions with longer paths.

===Parallel ant colony optimization (PACO)===
An ant colony system (ACS) with communication strategies is developed. The artificial ants are partitioned into several groups. Seven communication
methods for updating the pheromone level between groups in ACS are proposed and work on the traveling salesman problem.
===Continuous orthogonal ant colony (COAC)===
The pheromone deposit mechanism of COAC is to enable ants to search for solutions collaboratively and effectively. By using an orthogonal design method, ants in the feasible domain can explore their chosen regions rapidly and efficiently, with enhanced global search capability and accuracy. The orthogonal design method and the adaptive radius adjustment method can also be extended to other optimization algorithms for delivering wider advantages in solving practical problems.

===Recursive ant colony optimization===
It is a recursive form of ant system which divides the whole search domain into several sub-domains and solves the objective on these subdomains. The results from all the subdomains are compared and the best few of them are promoted for the next level. The subdomains corresponding to the selected results are further subdivided and the process is repeated until an output of desired precision is obtained. This method has been tested on ill-posed geophysical inversion problems and works well.

==Convergence==
For some versions of the algorithm, it is possible to prove that it is convergent (i.e., it is able to find the global optimum in finite time). The first evidence of convergence for an ant colony algorithm was made in 2000, the graph-based ant system algorithm, and later on for the ACS and MMAS algorithms. Like most metaheuristics, it is very difficult to estimate the theoretical speed of convergence. A performance analysis of a continuous ant colony algorithm with respect to its various parameters (edge selection strategy, distance measure metric, and pheromone evaporation rate) showed that its performance and rate of convergence are sensitive to the chosen parameter values, and especially to the value of the pheromone evaporation rate. In 2004, Zlochin and his colleagues showed that ACO-type algorithms are closely related to stochastic gradient descent, Cross-entropy method and estimation of distribution algorithm. They proposed an umbrella term &quot;Model-based search&quot; to describe this class of metaheuristics.

==Applications==

Ant colony optimization algorithms have been applied to many combinatorial optimization problems, ranging from quadratic assignment to protein folding or routing vehicles and a lot of derived methods have been adapted to dynamic problems in real variables, stochastic problems, multi-targets and parallel implementations.
It has also been used to produce near-optimal solutions to the travelling salesman problem. They have an advantage over simulated annealing and genetic algorithm approaches of similar problems when the graph may change dynamically; the ant colony algorithm can be run continuously and adapt to changes in real time. This is of interest in network routing and urban transportation systems.

The first ACO algorithm was called the ant system and it was aimed to solve the travelling salesman problem, in which the goal is to find the shortest round-trip to link a series of cities. The general algorithm is relatively simple and based on a set of ants, each making one of the possible round-trips along the cities. At each stage, the ant chooses to move from one city to another according to some rules:

# It must visit each city exactly once;
# A distant city has less chance of being chosen (the visibility);
# The more intense the pheromone trail laid out on an edge between two cities, the greater the probability that that edge will be chosen;
# Having completed its journey, the ant deposits more pheromones on all edges it traversed, if the journey is short;
# After each iteration, trails of pheromones evaporate.

===Antennas optimization and synthesis===
To optimize the form of antennas, ant colony algorithms can be used. As example can be considered antennas RFID-tags based on ant colony algorithms (ACO), loopback and unloopback vibrators 10×10

===Image processing===
The ACO algorithm is used in image processing for image edge detection and edge linking.
* Edge detection:
The graph here is the 2-D image and the ants traverse from one pixel depositing pheromone. The movement of ants from one pixel to another is directed by the local variation of the image&#x27;s intensity values. This movement causes the highest density of the pheromone to be deposited at the edges.

The following are the steps involved in edge detection using ACO:

&quot;Step 1: Initialization.&quot; Randomly place formula_39 ants on the image formula_40 where formula_41 . Pheromone matrix formula_42 are initialized with a random value. The major challenge in the initialization process is determining the heuristic matrix.

There are various methods to determine the heuristic matrix. For the below example the heuristic matrix was calculated based on the local statistics:
the local statistics at the pixel position formula_43.

:formula_44

where formula_45 is the image of size formula_46,

:formula_47

is a normalization factor, and

:formula_48

formula_49 can be calculated using the following functions:
:formula_50
:formula_51
:formula_52
:formula_53
The parameter formula_54 in each of above functions adjusts the functions’ respective shapes.

&quot;Step 2: Construction process.&quot; The ant&#x27;s movement is based on 4-connected pixels or 8-connected pixels. The probability with which the ant moves is given by the probability equation formula_55

&quot;Step 3 and step 5: Update process.&quot; The pheromone matrix is updated twice. in step 3 the trail of the ant (given by formula_56 ) is updated where as in step 5 the evaporation rate of the trail is updated which is given by:
:formula_57,
where formula_58 is the pheromone decay coefficient formula_59

&quot;Step 7: Decision process.&quot; Once the K ants have moved a fixed distance L for N iteration, the decision whether it is an edge or not is based on the threshold T on the pheromone matrix τ. Threshold for the below example is calculated based on Otsu&#x27;s method.

Image edge detected using ACO: The images below are generated using different functions given by the equation (1) to (4).

* Edge linking: ACO has also proven effective in edge linking algorithms.

==Definition difficulty==

With an ACO algorithm, the shortest path in a graph, between two points A and B, is built from a combination of several paths. It is not easy to give a precise definition of what algorithm is or is not an ant colony, because the definition may vary according to the authors and uses. Broadly speaking, ant colony algorithms are regarded as populated metaheuristics with each solution represented by an ant moving in the search space. Ants mark the best solutions and take account of previous markings to optimize their search. They can be seen as probabilistic multi-agent algorithms using a probability distribution to make the transition between each iteration. In their versions for combinatorial problems, they use an iterative construction of solutions. According to some authors, the thing which distinguishes ACO algorithms from other relatives (such as algorithms to estimate the distribution or particle swarm optimization) is precisely their constructive aspect. In combinatorial problems, it is possible that the best solution eventually be found, even though no ant would prove effective. Thus, in the example of the travelling salesman problem, it is not necessary that an ant actually travels the shortest route: the shortest route can be built from the strongest segments of the best solutions. However, this definition can be problematic in the case of problems in real variables, where no structure of &#x27;neighbours&#x27; exists. The collective behaviour of social insects remains a source of inspiration for researchers. The wide variety of algorithms (for optimization or not) seeking self-organization in biological systems has led to the concept of &quot;swarm intelligence&quot;, which is a very general framework in which ant colony algorithms fit.

==Stigmergy algorithms==
There is in practice a large number of algorithms claiming to be &quot;ant colonies&quot;, without always sharing the general framework of optimization by canonical ant colonies. In practice, the use of an exchange of information between ants via the environment (a principle called &quot;stigmergy&quot;) is deemed enough for an algorithm to belong to the class of ant colony algorithms. This principle has led some authors to create the term &quot;value&quot; to organize methods and behavior based on search of food, sorting larvae, division of labour and cooperative transportation.

:Similar to simulated annealing in that both traverse the solution space by testing mutations of an individual solution. While simulated annealing generates only one mutated solution, tabu search generates many mutated solutions and moves to the solution with the lowest fitness of those generated. To prevent cycling and encourage greater movement through the solution space, a tabu list is maintained of partial or complete solutions. It is forbidden to move to a solution that contains elements of the tabu list, which is updated as the solution traverses the solution space.

<doc id="588622" wikidata="Q1057079" url="?curid=588622" title="Pregnancy category">
<text>The pregnancy category of a medication is an assessment of the risk of fetal injury due to the pharmaceutical, if it is used as directed by the mother during pregnancy. It does &quot;not&quot; include any risks conferred by pharmaceutical agents or their metabolites in breast milk.

Every drug has specific information listed in its product literature. The British National Formulary used to provide a table of drugs to be avoided or used with caution in pregnancy, and did so using a limited number of key phrases, but now Appendix 4 (which was the Pregnancy table) has been removed. Appendix 4 is now titled &quot;Intravenous Additives&quot;. However, information that was previously available in the former Appendix 4 (pregnancy) and Appendix 5 (breastfeeding) is now available in the individual drug monographs.

==United States==
American law requires that certain drugs and biological products must be labelled very specifically. Title 21, Part 201.57 (9)(i) of the Code of Federal Regulations lists specific requirements regarding the labeling of drugs with respect to their effects on pregnant populations, including a definition of a &quot;pregnancy category&quot;. These rules are enforced by the Food and Drug Administration.

To supplement this information, the FDA publishes additional rules regarding pregnancy and lactation labeling.

The FDA does not regulate labeling for all hazardous and non-hazardous substances. Many substances, including alcohol, are widely known to cause serious hazards to pregnant women and their fetuses, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Many other pollutants and hazardous materials are similarly known to cause reproductive harm. However, some of these substances are not subject to drug labeling laws, and are therefore not assigned a &quot;Pregnancy Category&quot; per 21 CFR 201.57.

One characteristic of the FDA definitions of the pregnancy categories is that the FDA requires a relatively large amount of high-quality data on a pharmaceutical for it to be defined as Pregnancy Category A. As a result of this, many drugs that would be labelled as safe in other countries are allocated to Category C by the FDA.

===Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule of December 2014===
On December 13, 2014, the FDA published the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final Rule (PLLR), which changed the labeling requirements for the pregnancy and lactation sections for prescription drugs and biological agents. The final rule removed the pregnancy letter categories, and created descriptive subsections for pregnancy exposure and risk, lactation, and effects to reproductive potential for females and males. Labeling changes from this rule began on June 30, 2015, with all submissions for prescription drugs and biological agents using the labeling changes immediately. Previously approved drugs from June 30, 2001, will switch to the new labeling gradually. The rule does not affect the labeling of over-the-counter drugs or of drugs approved prior to June 30, 2001.

==Australia==
Australia has a slightly different pregnancy category system from the United States. The categorisation of medicines for use in pregnancy does not follow a hierarchical structure.

* Notably the subdivision of Category B. (For drugs in B1, B2 and B3 categories, human data are lacking or inadequate and subcategorisation is actually based on animal data instead)
* The allocation of a B category does not imply greater safety than C category
* Medicines in category D are not absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy (e.g. anticonvulsants)

The system, as outlined below, was developed by medical and scientific experts based on available evidence of risks associated with taking particular medicines while pregnant. Being general in nature, it is not presented as medical advice to health professionals or the public.

Some prescribing guides, such as the Australian Medicines Handbook, are shifting away from using pregnancy categories since, inherent in these categories, there is an implied assumption that the alphabetical code is one of safety when this is not always the case. Categorisation does not indicate which stages of fetal development might be affected and does not convey information about the balance between risks and benefits in a particular situation. Additionally, categories are not necessarily maintained or updated with availability of new data.

<doc id="588639" wikidata="Q1421013" url="?curid=588639" title="Qikiqtaaluk Region">
<text>The Qikiqtaaluk Region, Qikiqtani Region (Inuktitut syllabics: ᕿᑭᖅᑖᓗᒃ ) or the Baffin Region is the easternmost, northernmost, and southernmost administrative region of Nunavut, Canada. Qikiqtaaluk is the traditional Inuktitut name for Baffin Island. Although the Qikiqtaaluk Region is the most commonly used name in official contexts, several notable public organizations, including Statistics Canada prior to the 2021 Canadian census, use the older term Baffin Region.

With a population of 18,988 and an area of , slightly smaller than Egypt, it is the largest and most populated of the three regions. It is also the largest second-level administrative division in the world.

The region consists of Baffin Island, the Belcher Islands, Akimiski Island, Mansel Island, Prince Charles Island, Bylot Island, Devon Island, Baillie-Hamilton Island, Cornwallis Island, Bathurst Island, Amund Ringnes Island, Ellef Ringnes Island, Axel Heiberg Island, Ellesmere Island, the Melville Peninsula, the eastern part of Melville Island, and the northern parts of both Prince of Wales Island and Somerset Island, plus smaller islands in between. The regional centre, and territorial capital, is Iqaluit (population 7,740). The Qikiqtaaluk Region spans the northernmost, easternmost, and southernmost areas of Nunavut.

Before 1999, the Qikiqtaaluk Region existed under slightly different boundaries in the Northwest Territories as the Baffin Region, in the northern part of the District of Keewatin.

The western half of the nearby Hans Island is part of the Qikiqtaaluk, while the eastern half is part of Greenland and is in the municipality of Avannaata.

==Communities==

All of Qikiqtaaluk&#x27;s thirteen communities are located on tidal water and just under half of its residents live in Nunavut&#x27;s capital and only city, Iqaluit (7,740.). The majority of the rest live in twelve hamlets—Arctic Bay (868), Kinngait (1,441), Clyde River (1,053), Grise Fiord (129), Sanirajak (848), Igloolik (1,682), Kimmirut (389), Pangnirtung (1,481), Pond Inlet (1,617), Qikiqtarjuaq (598), Resolute (198) and Sanikiluaq (882). Alert (CFS Alert) and Eureka are part of Qikiqtaaluk, Unorganized (permanent population 0) areas in the Qikiqtaaluk.

Formerly, there was a mining town at Nanisivik. However, it and the Nanisivik Mine closed in 2002, with Nanisivik Airport closing in 2010 and all flights transferred to Arctic Bay Airport.
Like the majority of Canada&#x27;s Inuit communities, the region&#x27;s traditional foods include seal, Arctic char, walrus, polar bear, and caribou.

Inhabitants of the Qikiqtaaluk Region are called &quot;Qikiqtaalungmiut&quot;.

==Iqaluit==

Iqaluit has the Astro Hill Complex, the Nunatta Sunakkutaangit Museum and the Legislative Building of Nunavut and the Unikkaarvik Visitors Centre.

==Pre-contact==
According to anthropologists and historians, the Inuit are the descendants of the Thule people who displaced the Dorset culture (in Inuktitut, the Tuniit). By 1300 the Inuit had trade routes with more southern cultures.

==History==

About 1910, Europeans markets increased their interest in white fox pelts. The distribution and mobility of Inuit changed as they expanded their traditional hunting and fishing routes to participate in the white fox fur trade. Traditional food staples—such as seal and caribou—were not always found in the same regions as white fox. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company—which was chartered in 1670—had been opening fur trading posts throughout Inuit and First Nations territory. By 1910, the HBC was restructured into a lands sales department, retail and fur trade. The HBC dominated the fur trade under minimal supervision from the Canadian government, and some Anglican and Catholic missionaries who lived near remote northern hamlets. By 1922, most of imported goods acquired by Inuit were from the HBC.

<doc id="588642" wikidata="Q155017" url="?curid=588642" title="511 Davida">
<text>511 Davida is a large C-type asteroid in the asteroid belt. It is one of the largest asteroids; approximately tied for 7th place, to within measurement uncertainties, and the 5th or 6th most massive. It was discovered by R. S. Dugan in 1903. Davida is named after David Peck Todd, an astronomy professor at Amherst College.

== Physical characteristics ==

Davida is approximately 270–310 km in diameter and comprises an estimated 1.5% of the total mass of the asteroid belt. It is a C-type asteroid, which means that it is dark in colouring with a carbonaceous chondrite composition.

From 2002 to 2007, astronomers at the Keck Observatory used the Keck II telescope, which is fitted with adaptive optics, to photograph Davida. The asteroid is not a dwarf planet: there are at least two promontories and at least one flat facet with 15-km deviations from a best-fit ellipsoid. The facet is presumably a 150-km global-scale crater like the ones seen on 253 Mathilde. Conrad et al. (2007) show that craters of this size &quot;can be expected from the impactor size distribution, without likelihood of catastrophic disruption of Davida.&quot;

=== Mass ===
In 2001, Michalak estimated Davida to have a mass of . In 2007, Baer and Chesley estimated Davida to have a mass of . , Baer suggests Davida has a mass of . This most recent estimate by Baer indicates that Davida is approximately tied with 704 Interamnia as the fifth-most-massive asteroid, though the error bars of Interamnia are large.
== Occultations ==
There have been 9 occultation events observed since 1987, many of which produced two or three chords. Two examples shown here.

<doc id="588643" wikidata="Q1430823" url="?curid=588643" title="Colorado Party (Uruguay)">
<text>The Colorado Party (, , PC) is a liberal political party in Uruguay.

Its existence can be traced back to the origins of the Uruguayan republic, in the 1830s, and since then until the late 1990s it remained the most dominant political party in the country, holding power almost uninterruptedly (alternating with the National Party, its greatest rival) until its electoral collapse in the 2004 elections, when the Party obtained only 10% of the vote. Since then, the Colorados have been able to recuperate some of their lost support, but as of 2024 they haven’t reached the 20% threshold in any of the elections celebrated in that period (2009, 2014, 2019, 2024).

Their current position in the Uruguayan political landscape is conditioned by the unofficial coalition they’ve formed with the National Party (&quot;Partido Nacional&quot;; another center-right political party, traditionally the Colorado’s greatest adversary), in opposition to the Broad Front (&quot;Frente Amplio&quot;). The Front is a leftist coalition formed in the early 1970s that has become, since the 1999 election, the most-voted electoral force in the country, reshaping Uruguayan electoral politics and displacing the Colorado Party from its traditional position of dominance to becoming the third party in the country, behind the National Party.

During the first third of the XXth century, and under the stewardship and legacy of José Batlle y Ordóñez (1856-1929), the largest sectors of the Colorado Party stood for a radical agenda of social reform, including the promotion of workers’ rights, women’s rights, statism and the ample provision of public services, democratic political reform and regular use of direct democracy mechanisms, secularization, and the establishment of a generous welfare state. During the 1940s and 1950s, led by Luis Batlle Berres (nephew of José Batlle) this Batllista wing of the Colorado Party stood also for state-led industrialization efforts and an economic dirigiste regime. In the late 1960s, though, the Party began to abandon the most radical part of that social agenda (as well as the dirigiste approach to economic matters) and now stands in the center, center-right of the Uruguayan political spectrum. Current high-profile personalities from the Party include Andrés Ojeda and Pedro Bordaberry.

== Ideology ==
The party seeks to unite moderate and liberal groups, although its members have had a diverse set of ideologies since its foundation, including Krausism and liberal conservatism, as well as general pragmatism. It was the dominant party of government almost without exception during the stabilization of the Uruguayan republic.

The Colorado Party has traditionally been an ideologically diverse party, with one study from the 1950s noting that &quot;the liberal ideological position assumed by the Colorado. a half-century ago under the drive of Batlle has forced the Blancos or Nationalists to become more relatively conservative in position. On the part of both major parties, however, many inconsistencies and many ideological subdivisions, temporary or permanent, occur. Each of the large parties has its conservatives and its liberals, and party lines are often difficult to hold in congressional debate.”

== History ==
At the 2004 national elections, the Colorado Party won 10 seats out of 99 in the Chamber of Representatives and 3 seats out of 31 in the Senate. Its presidential candidate, Guillermo Stirling, won 10.4% of the popular vote and placed third, ending the 10-year rule of the Colorado Party and the two-party system.

=== Earlier history ===
The Colorado Party was founded in Montevideo, Uruguay, on 17 September 1836.

Some of its significant historical leaders were Fructuoso Rivera, Venancio Flores, José Batlle y Ordóñez, Luis Batlle Berres, Jorge Pacheco Areco, Juan María Bordaberry, Julio María Sanguinetti, Luis Bernardo Pozzolo, and Jorge Batlle.

The party has historically been the most elected party in Uruguayan history with almost uninterrupted dominance during the 20th century. The Colorados were in office from 1865 to 1959, when they were defeated by the Partido Nacional in the 1958 elections. They returned to office after the 1966 elections. They won the first elections at the end of the military dictatorship, in 1984. They went on to win the 1994 and 1999 elections.

==== Traditional rivals ====
From its birth until the last decades of the 20th century its traditional rival was the conservative Partido Nacional (also called Partido Blanco).

=== Post-2004: defeat at polls and rise of Pedro Bordaberry ===

The Colorado Party suffered its worst defeat ever in the 2004 national elections, with little over 10 per cent of the popular vote for its presidential candidate Guillermo Stirling, and having only three out of thirty national Senators. There were many reasons for the party&#x27;s failure, including the economic crisis and old party leaders. Subsequently to his defeat in 2004, Guillermo Stirling endorsed Pedro Bordaberry&#x27;s &quot;Vamos Uruguay&quot; movement. Bordaberry Herrán became the presidential candidate for the 2009 presidential election, and placed third, with 17 percent of the vote, behind José Mujica and Luis Alberto Lacalle. Bordaberry Herrán placed third again in the 2014 presidential election, with 13% of the vote.

== Electoral history ==

=== Presidential elections ===
==== Note ====
Under the electoral system in place at the time called Ley de Lemas system, each political party could have as many as three presidential candidates. The combined result of the votes for a party&#x27;s candidates determined which party would control the executive branch, and whichever of the winning party&#x27;s candidates finished in first place would be declared President this system was used form the 1942 election until the 1994 election until in 1996, a referendum amended the constitution to restrict each party to a single presidential candidate, effective from the 1999 elections.

<text>Chylomicrons (from the Greek χυλός, chylos, meaning &quot;juice&quot; (of plants or animals), and micron, meaning &quot;small&quot;), also known as ultra low-density lipoproteins (ULDL), are lipoprotein particles that consist of triglycerides (85–92%), phospholipids (6–12%), cholesterol (1–3%), and proteins (1–2%). They transport dietary lipids, such as fats and cholesterol, from the intestines to other locations in the body, within the water-based solution of the bloodstream. ULDLs are one of the five major groups lipoproteins are divided into based on their density. A protein specific to chylomicrons is ApoB48.

There is an inverse relationship in the density and size of lipoprotein particles: fats have a lower density than water or smaller protein molecules, and the larger particles have a higher ratio of internal fat molecules with respect to the outer emulsifying protein molecules in the shell. ULDLs, if in the region of 1,000 nm or more, are the only lipoprotein particles that can be seen using a light microscope, at maximum magnification. All the other classes are submicroscopic.

== Function ==
Chylomicrons transport lipids absorbed from the intestine to adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle tissue, where their triglyceride components are hydrolyzed by the activity of the lipoprotein lipase, allowing the released free fatty acids to be absorbed by the tissues. When a large portion of the triglyceride core has been hydrolyzed, chylomicron remnants are formed and are taken up by the liver, thereby also transferring dietary fat to the liver.

== Stages ==

=== Nascent chylomicrons ===
In the small intestine, dietary triglycerides are emulsified by bile and digested by pancreatic lipases, resulting in the formation of monoglycerides and fatty acids. These lipids are absorbed into enterocytes via passive diffusion. Inside these cells, monoglycerides and fatty acids are transported to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER), where they are re-esterified to form triglycerides. These triglycerides, along with phospholipids and cholesterol, are added to apolipoprotein B48 to form nascent chylomicrons (also referred to as immature chylomicrons or pre-chylomicrons).

After synthesis in the smooth ER, nascent chylomicrons are transported to the Golgi apparatus by SAR1B proteins. The transport of nascent chylomicrons within the secretory pathway is facilitated by protein transport vesicles (PCTVs). PCTVs are uniquely equipped with v-SNARE and VAMP-7 proteins, which aid in their fusion with the cis-Golgi compartment. This transport is facilitated by COPII proteins, including Sec23/24, which select cargo and facilitate vesicle budding from the ER membrane.

During transit through the Golgi, nascent chylomicrons undergo enzymatic modification and lipidation processes, resulting in the formation of mature chylomicrons.

=== Mature chylomicrons ===
Mature chylomicrons are released through the basolateral membrane of enterocytes (via the secretory pathway) into lacteals, lymphatic capillaries in the villi of the small intestine. Lymph that contains chylomicrons (and other emulsified fats) is referred to as chyle. The lymphatic circulation carries chyle to the lymphatic ducts before it enters the venous return of the systemic circulation via subclavian veins. From here, chylomicrons can supply tissue throughout the body with fat absorbed from the diet. Because they enter the bloodstream in this way, digested lipids (in the form of chylomicrons) bypass the hepatic portal system and thus avoid first pass metabolism, unlike digested carbohydrates (in the form of monosaccharides) and proteins (in the form of amino acids).

While circulating in blood, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) donate essential components including apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) to the mature chylomicron. APOC2 is a crucial coenzyme for the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which hydrolyzes triglycerides within chylomicrons.

===Chylomicron remnants===
Once triglyceride stores are distributed, chylomicrons return APOC2 to HDLs while retaining APOE, transforming into a chylomicron remnant. ApoB48 and APOE are important to identify the chylomicron remnant in the liver for endocytosis and breakdown.

== Pathology ==

=== Hyperchylomicronemia ===
Hyperchylomicronemia is characterized by an excessive presence of chylomicrons in the blood, leading to extreme hypertriglyceridemia. Clinical manifestations of this disorder include eruptive xanthomas, lipaemia retinalis, hepatosplenomegaly, recurrent abdominal pain, and acute pancreatitis. This condition can be caused by genetic mutations (see below) or secondary factors such as uncontrolled diabetes or alcohol use disorder.

=== Hypochylomicronemia ===
Hypochylomicronemia refers to abnormally low levels or complete absence of chylomicrons in the blood, particularly after a meal (postprandial). This condition can result from genetic mutations (see below), as well as certain malabsorption syndromes or deficiencies in dietary fat intake.

== Related disorders ==

=== Chylomicron remnants and cardiovascular disease ===
Chylomicron remnants are the lipoprotein particles left after chylomicrons have delivered triglycerides to tissues. Elevated levels of these remnants contribute to hyperlipidemia, which is considered an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Recent studies have demonstrated that chylomicron remnants can penetrate the tunica intima and become trapped in the subendothelial space. This process enhances the deposition of cholesterol in the arterial wall, which is a critical step in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The retention and modification of these remnants within the arterial wall trigger inflammatory responses, further accelerating the development of atherosclerosis.

=== Related genetic disorders ===

==== Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) ====
Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL; OMIM 200100) is a rare &quot;autosomal recessive&quot; disorder caused by mutations in both alleles of the MTP gene. This genetic defect leads to nearly undetectable levels of ApoB and very low plasma cholesterol levels. Patients with ABL exhibit fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, and fat accumulation in enterocytes and hepatocytes. The condition also results in multiple vitamin deficiencies (E, A, K, and D) due to impaired lipoprotein assembly and transport. If untreated, ABL can cause neurological disturbances such as spinal-cerebellar degeneration, peripheral neuropathies, and retinitis pigmentosa. Early supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins can prevent these complications.

==== Homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia (Ho-HBL) ====
Homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia (Ho-HBL; OMIM 107730) is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by improper packaging and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins due to mutations in both alleles of the APOB gene. These mutations lead to apoB truncations or amino acid substitutions, resulting in the formation of short, abnormal apoBs that are unable to bind lipids and form chylomicrons. Clinical manifestations vary, ranging from lack of symptoms to features overlapping with those of ABL, including fat malabsorption and vitamin deficiencies.

==== Chylomicron retention disease (CMRD) ====
Chylomicron retention disease (CMRD; OMIM #607689) is a rare &quot;autosomal recessive&quot; disorder caused by mutations in the SAR1B gene. Patients with CMRD present with chronic diarrhea, failure to thrive, hypocholesterolemia, and low levels of fat-soluble vitamins. The enterocytes of these patients fail to secrete chylomicrons into the lymph, leading to lipid accumulation and characteristic mucosal changes in the small intestine. Unlike ABL and Ho-HBL, CMRD does not cause acanthocytosis, retinitis pigmentosa, or severe neurological symptoms.

==== Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS) ====
Familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), also known as Type I hyperlipoproteinemia, is characterized by massive hypertriglyceridemia, abdominal pain, pancreatitis, eruptive xanthomas, and hepatosplenomegaly. This condition is caused by mutations in genes such as LPL, APOC-II, APOA-V, LMF1, and GPIHBP1, which are involved in the regulation of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein catabolism. Patients with FCS show significantly elevated fasting concentrations of chylomicrons and do not typically develop premature atherosclerosis due to the large size of chylomicrons preventing their traversal through the vascular endothelial barrier. Diagnosis is confirmed by DNA sequencing for pathogenic mutations in these genes.

<text>Akimiski Island is the largest island in James Bay (a southeasterly extension of Hudson Bay), Canada, which is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region of the territory of Nunavut. It has an area of , making it the 163rd largest island in the world, and Canada&#x27;s 29th largest island. Akimiski Island is from the province of Ontario. From the western side of the island, the Ontario coastline is visible.

The island&#x27;s name is Swampy Cree for &quot;land across the water&quot;.

The island has no year-round human inhabitants. The surface of Akimiski is flat and slopes gradually to the north. Most of the vegetation that covers the island consists of lichen, moss, sedges, and dwarf black spruce. The island is a coastal wetland that includes mudflats, tidal marshes, and tidal mudflats. Freshwater streams that flow into southwestern James Bay carry sediments and abundant nutrients that help to sustain the productive waterfowl habitat around Akimiski Island.

The Akimiski Island Group includes Akimiski, Gasket, and Gullery islands; Albert Shoal; and the Akimiski Strait Isles.

==Climate==
* Mean annual temperature: 
* Average rainfall: 
* Average snowfall: 

==Conservation==

Akimiski Island is the site of the Akimiski Island Migratory Bird Sanctuary, a Canadian Important Bird Area, site #NU036 (). Its eastern portion is also a federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary, and much of the coastline is a Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat site.

==Fauna==
The coastal waters and wetlands of Akimiski Island (and James Bay in general) are important feeding grounds for many varieties of migratory birds. Notable species include:
* Atlantic brant
* Canada goose
* Lesser snow goose
* Marbled godwit
* Semipalmated sandpiper

Because James Bay and Hudson Bay are funnel-shaped, migrating birds from the Arctic concentrate in this area. During fall migration, an abundance of birds with both adults and young are present. In the springtime, the birds tend to reside in the southern areas of James Bay until the northern section thaws.

Among mammals, ringed seals, polar bears, and beluga whales can be found in the area.

<text>The National Republican Association (, ANR), also known as the Colorado Party (), is a conservative political party in Paraguay, founded on 11 September 1887 by Bernardino Caballero. Since 1947, the &quot;colorados&quot;, as they are known, has been dominant in Paraguayan politics (ruling as the only legal party between 1947 and 1962) and has controlled the presidency since 1948 –notwithstanding a brief interruption between 2008 and 2013– as well as having a majority in both chambers of Congress and department governorships.

The Colorado Party has historically been and continues to be the dominant political party in Paraguay. With 2.6 million members as of 2022 (although there are allegations of numerous false affiliations made by the party), it is the largest political party in the country, usually ruling without the necessity of electoral alliances. Paraguay was for several decades under dictatorial rule by Alfredo Stroessner&#x27;s Colorado Party until he was ousted from power in 1989, which set off a democratization process. Since then, there has been an expansion of civil and political liberties, as well as elections at presidential, congressional, and municipal levels. However, the democratization process has been limited due to the firm control of the Colorado Party on the Paraguay state. The Colorado Party retains power through clientelistic practices. Corruption is widespread in Paraguay.

==History==
===1887–1989===
The party, though founded only in 1887 as an answer to the foundation of the Liberal Party in that same year, already informally existed from the late 1870s onward, as a political group centered around Bernardino Caballero, Cándido Bareiro and José Segundo Decoud.

It formally ruled the country from its foundation until 1904, when it was overthrown in the Revolution of 1904. It became the dominant political force in the country when it rejoined the government in 1947, following the conclusion of the 1947 civil war, during Higinio Moríñigo&#x27;s rule as president. During this time, the party operated multiple paramilitary wings. From 1947 until 1962, the Colorado Party ruled Paraguay as a one-party state; all other political parties were illegal. In 1962, all national parties were nominally legalized; the Communist Party being deemed &quot;international&quot; remained illegal and its adherents repressed by the Paraguayan state. In practice, however, Paraguay remained a one-party military dictatorship, with the Colorado Party serving as one of the &quot;twin pillars&quot; of Alfredo Stroessner&#x27;s rule, who had assumed the presidency following a coup in 1954 and lasted until 1989, one of the longest in history by a non-royal leader. During Stroessner&#x27;s rule, all members of the armed forces and government employees were required to be members of the Colorado Party. Dissident groups within the party were purged, and two (Movimiento Popular Colorado and Asociación Nacional Republicana en el Exilio y la Resistencia) acted as opposition groups in exile until the 1980s. In 1987, there was a rift in the party between a hardliner faction supportive of Stroessner&#x27;s rule and a traditionalist faction. This rift was primarily over the issue of Stroessner&#x27;s succession and was a large contributor to the 1989 coup d&#x27;état led by General Andrés Rodríguez, himself a traditionalist, which ousted Stroessner from power.

=== Since 1989===
In 2002, the National Union of Ethical Citizens split from the party.

During the 2003 Paraguayan general election, at the legislative elections the party won 35.3% of the popular vote (37 out of 80 seats) in the Chamber of Deputies of Paraguay and 32.9% (16 out of 45 seats) in the Senate. Its candidate at the presidential elections on the same date, Nicanor Duarte, was elected with 37.1% of the popular vote.

On 20 April 2008, for the first time in 61 years, the Colorado Party lost the presidential elections to an opposition candidate from the centre-left, Fernando Lugo, a Roman Catholic bishop, a first on both accounts (free election of an opposition candidate and of a bishop to the office of president in Paraguay). The Colorado Party was represented in these elections by Blanca Ovelar, the first woman to run for the presidency. Fernando Lugo, who had renounced the cloth before the elections so that he could become eligible under Paraguayan law, was formally released from his vows by the Vatican before his inauguration as president on 15 August 2008.

According to Antonio Soljancic, a social scientist at the Autonomous University of Asunción, &quot;in order to get a job, you have to show you are a party member. The problem Paraguay has is that, although Stroessner disappeared from the political map, he left a legacy that no one has tried to bury&quot;.

== Electoral history ==

<doc id="588660" wikidata="Q6689271" url="?curid=588660" title="Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts">
<text>The Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts (LSMSA) is a public residential high school located in Natchitoches, Louisiana, US on the campus of Northwestern State University (NSU). It is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology (NCSSSMST). In 2016, Niche ranked LSMSA the 9th best public high school nationwide.

== Background ==
LSMSA is the brainchild of State Representative Jimmy D. Long of Natchitoches, Robert A. Alost, then Dean of the College of Education at Northwestern State University; Democratic State Senator Donald G. Kelly of Natchitoches; and Governor David C. Treen, which is where the Treen auditorium gets its name. The school was conceived to offer a unique experience to the state&#x27;s brightest students while supplying Natchitoches with an influx of commerce and attention. On the heels of a fleeting surplus of state funds from oil revenues following America&#x27;s oil crises of the late seventies, Gov. Treen approved the funding for the school. Classes were originally held on the ground floor of Prudhomme Hall, an unused dormitory on the campus of NSU while female students lived in the upper floor and male students originally lived in Bossier Hall, another dorm. Renovation of the &quot;High School Building,&quot; (known by no other formal title, but formerly the campus of Natchitoches High School) was completed in 1984, and the ceremonial ribbon was cut by then Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards.

The Louisiana School was the second state-supported residential school of its kind — the first being the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, which opened in 1980. The school was founded in the early 1980s with the first class enrolling as juniors in the fall of 1983, graduating in 1985.

Academically, the school is similar to the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM). Studies focus on mathematics, science, and the humanities. Like NCSSM math and science high schools, it has an arts program, with instruction in music, theater, visual art, and dance. Daily class schedules are conducted similar to college schedules (instead of the traditional class periods in most other high schools). Much of the classes are also taught with college textbooks.

Among the various ensembles in both voice and instrumental, student musicians get the opportunity to perform music special to Louisiana through the Louisiana Composers&#x27; Consortium founded by LSMSA&#x27;s own Dr. Al Benner.

The school&#x27;s College Admission Profile summarizes the school: &quot;Graduating its first class in 1985, the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts is a state-supported, residential program, enrolling high achieving and talented students throughout Louisiana in grades ten through twelve. Most students begin as sophomores or juniors and are selected from a pool of applicants representing at least 65% of the state&#x27;s public school districts, as well as private schools. The student body, therefore, represents the ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic diversity of Louisiana residents. LSMSA is considered as a &quot;Special School&quot; by the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.&quot;

In 2017, state Senator Francis C. Thompson of Delhi introduced legislation to name the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts in honor of Jimmy D. Long, who as the chairman for sixteen years of the House Education Committee, was among those instrumental in the establishment of the institution. After strong support in the state Senate, the renaming legislation passed the House Education Committee despite heated opposition from alumni who object in part to the school having such a lengthy name.

== Admissions ==

As LSMSA recruits students from all of Louisiana, it can be described as a statewide magnet school. Prospective students apply during the fall of their freshman, sophomore or junior year. Applicants submit application forms, grade transcripts, SAT or ACT results, and four letters of recommendation with one optional recommendation form. Applicants to the arts curriculum also submit a portfolio of artwork or audition. As of the 2007–2008 school year, LSMSA added its first sophomore class, which composed of 40 students. 65 students have been invited to be in the 2008–2009 Sophomore class.

== Residential life ==

Students who attend LSMSA live in dorms, away from their families, much like college students. For most of the school&#x27;s history, students lived in Caddo Hall (girls) or Prudhomme Hall (boys), both long-term loans from Northwestern State University. On March 13, 2019, LSMSA hosted a groundbreaking ceremony for a residence hall of their own. The four-story, 110,000 sf Living Learning Commons was designed by the joint-venture architectural team of Ashe Broussard Weinzettle and Tipton Associates. In August 2021, students returned to campus for the school year and became the first classes to occupy the Living Learning Commons. The $25 million facility, funded by the State of Louisiana, houses 360 students across 3 towers and 10 independent &quot;neighborhoods.&quot; Amenities include a student lounge, covered porch, craft room, study rooms, a grand lobby, a health clinic, a demonstration kitchen and dining area, and an outdoor firepit. The Hall Commons in each neighborhood is suited for sharing a meal or hanging out, while the glassed-in study lounges maintain quiet for focus. Each neighborhood also features laundry facilities, with costs included in the student fee, as well as an office and apartment for the Student Life Advisor.
Rules regarding residential life are fairly stringent. Students have free time during weekdays during which they can sign out to various areas within the city of Natchitoches. The Louisiana School provides a shuttle for transportation because students can only use their cars to drive home on weekends, unless they have high grades and a good disciplinary record, in which case they may use their cars for a specified time period.
As LSMSA is located on a university campus, much of the residential life of LSMSA students resembles that of their university counterparts. Whereas a university has relatively little liability to bear when dealing with 18+ year old adults, LSMSA must contend with a student body mainly of minors. The school tries to enforce rigorous discipline under terms of &quot;in loco parentis,&quot; meaning in the place of a parent.

== Academic integrity ==
Students must agree to the following honor code pledge:

As a student of the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts, I understand that I belong to an institution dedicated to the pursuit of learning. Thus, I promise to uphold the Honor Code that safeguards this pursuit. I accept my personal duty to promote an honorable attitude in my academic life by refraining from lying, cheating, stealing, plagiarizing, or vandalizing.

<text>Il Vernacoliere is an Italian monthly satirical magazine based in Livorno, Tuscany, Italy, founded in 1982 by editor-director Mario Cardinali. The periodical started to operate as a successor of the pre-existing &quot;Livornocronaca&quot;, first issued in 1961. &quot;Il Vernacoliere&quot; is characterised by its absence of advertising, its satirical style, and for the widespread use of the dialect of Livorno. It is now distributed throughout Tuscany, in many newsstands of central Italy, and in selected ones in the rest of Italy.

==History and profile==
The magazine traces its roots in &quot;Livornocronaca&quot;, which operated weekly from 1961 to 1969 and which was written in standard Italian. Livornocronaca was issued twice a month from 1969 to 1972, and eventually only monthly with the subtitle &quot;Il Vernacoliere&quot;. In 1982, the title &quot;Livornocronaca&quot; was dropped, and the name was changed permanently into &quot;Il Vernacoliere&quot;. The magazine slowly but steadily gained momentum beyond the borders of the Province of Livorno, and it is now read in most Northern and Central Italy.

Il Vernacoliere is well known for its popular, raw, heavily irreverent political and social satire, written in the dialect of Livorno or, at the very least, with a distinctive Tuscan tinge. The magazine features satirical articles, comics, and an editorial note (in standard Italian), with the occasional addition of opinion pieces. Amongst Italian magazines, Il Vernacoliere is notable for having no advertising, covering all its expenses with the sale of the journal and of the associated gadgets. Its famous &quot;locandine&quot;, (in ) are saucy showcases of the main articles of the magazine, to be displayed at newsstands. Their text is written by the Director.

The founder and current Director of Il Vernacoliere is Mario Cardinali. He is also the author of most political satire pieces, written in pure and witty Livorno dialect. Notable Vernacoliere contributors include Federico Maria Sardelli, Daniele Caluri, Max Greggio, Marco Citi, Ettore Borzacchini, and Andrea Camerini.

The periodical is considered to be one of the freest magazines currently published in Italy. According to journalist Camillo Langone, it is an example that, in present-day Italy, satire can be published at a dialectal level only, while not viable in standard Italian.

<text>Sanikiluaq ( ) is a municipality and Inuit community located on the north coast of Flaherty Island in Hudson Bay, on the Belcher Islands. Despite being geographically much closer to the shores of Ontario and Quebec, the community and the Belcher Islands lie within the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada.

==History==
The community was developed in the early 1970s to replace &quot;South Camp&quot;, located further south in the island group. To the north of the town is Kinngaaluk Territorial Park, a space designed for camping, cultural expression, and seasonal hunting. The park contains archaeological remains deposited by the Dorset and Thule cultures. The park was formally designated as such by the Nunavut legislature in 2019. The master plan for the park, drawn up by NVision Insight Group, won an award from the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects in 2019.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Sanikiluaq had a population of 1,010 living in 228 of its 252 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 882. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Economic development ==
Sanikiluaq had an eider down factory for 20 years. It closed down in 2005 due to government funding running out and the population of eider ducks decreasing at a rapid rate. The factory reopened in June 2015.

==Transportation==
It is the southernmost community in the territory, and is served by the Sanikiluaq Airport. Air service is provided by Air Inuit, Calm Air and Panorama Aviation.

==Education==
There are two schools in the community, Nuiyak School, with 11 teaching staff, teaches grades K-6, with 125 students enrolled. Paatsaali School has 177 students and teaches grades 7-12. In 2007, former principal Lisi Kavik was named one of Canada&#x27;s Outstanding Principals.

== Broadband communications ==
The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSi Canada. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice.

==Government==
The community is in the Hudson Bay electoral district and Daniel Qavvik is the member of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut. He replaced long time incumbent, Allan Rumbolt, in the 2021 Nunavut general election.

In the territorial election held October 25, 2021, the candidates were Mick Appaqaq, Ronald Ladd, and Daniel Qavvik. Allan Rumbolt who had represented the riding since the 2008 Nunavut general election did not run. Qavvik won with 227 votes (70.1%) over Appaqaq with 86 (26.5%) and Ladd with 8 (2.5%).

The local municipality has a Hamlet Council of eight elected councillors and a mayor. At the last hamlet election, held October 28, 2019, Johnnie Cookie was re-elected mayor with 191 (67.5%) over Jonasie Emikotailuk with 21 (7.4%), votes, and Elijassie Kavik with 69 (24.4%) votes.



== Revival of basket making ==

In 1996, Nunavut Arctic College began a project in Sanikiluaq, to revive the art of sewing baskets, &quot;qisiq&quot;, from &quot;ivigag&quot; or lyme grass (&quot;Leymus mollis&quot;), which is common along the shorelines of Hudson Bay. Traditional grass baskets made by the Sanikiluaqmiut, residents of Sanikiluaq, are finely crafted, and are unique: they have lids and handles often carved from soapstone, and it &quot;can take weeks to make just one grapefruit-sized basket&quot;.

The baskets are of great significance to the community, because of the complexity of the sewing and coiling techniques used, but there were no remaining experienced basket-makers practising the art. Therefore, community members came together to revive the art of traditional Sanikiluaq basketry, consulting Elders for their advice and knowledge, as well as using photographs and descriptions from the Canadian Museum of History (then the Museum of Civilization) in Ottawa, and relying on their collective cultural memory and extant skills.

==Film==
Written and directed by Joel Heath, with support from the community of Sanikiluaq, &quot;People of a Feather&quot; is a documentary film about the relationship between climate change, hydroelectric dams, eider ducks and the people of the Belcher Islands.

Before European contact, the Mount Isa region was part of an expansive trade network spanning the entire Lake Eyre Basin and beyond. In particular, it was a valued source of stone for stone tools such as hand axes.

In the , the town of Mount Isa had a population of 18,317 people, making Mount Isa the administrative, commercial and industrial centre for the state&#x27;s vast north-western region. Although situated in an arid area, the artificial Lake Moondarra north of the city on the Leichhardt River provides both drinking water and an area for watersports, birdwatching and recreation. Locals often refer to Mount Isa as &quot;The Isa&quot;.

Due to the lead production in the city, Mount Isa needs one of the most intensive air quality monitoring systems in Australia. Concerns have been raised over childhood lead contamination and air pollution within the city. The Mount Isa Mines (MIM) in particular are a source of significant lead pollution.

== Geography ==
The Leichhardt River divides the city into areas known as &quot;mineside&quot; and &quot;townside&quot;. Xstrata, the power station and the Airport are on the mineside, whilst the majority of the city, including the CBD and Base Hospital are on the townside. In recent years, population increases associated with the mining boom has increased demand for accommodation and land. The city had spread out, with new suburbs in the south-east and north of the city being planned or developed. Planned expansions can cater for more than 40,000 people.

== History ==
Long before European contact, the Mount Isa region was a centre for trade and production of dolerite and basalt stone tools and objects. There is evidence of ground-edge stone tools as old as 20,000 years, the earliest in the world, originating from Mount Isa quarries. As of about 1000 years before the present (BP), large, ground-edge stone axes from Mount Isa were particularly prized by the peoples of the Lake Eyre Basin. They were not only valuable tools, but valuable trade items as well, and were often traded for the tobacco plant pituri. Archaeologist Iain Davidson suggests that they were traded partly for reasons unrelated to function, as they were often sought after despite the availability of local resources. Leilira blades were also likely produced in the Mount Isa region, though dating is uncertain.

Rock art is abundant in the region as well. It largely consists of engraved petrographs and free-painted designs; stenciled designs are rare. Rock art in the Mount Isa region varies stylistically site-by-site, and includes circular, geometric, and figurative motifs. One figurative motif particular to the Mount Isa region is the north-west central Queensland anthropomorph figure. They are usually painted one color with an outline in a different color (often red and yellow, respectively) and have distinctive feathered headdresses, no face, and often a third leg which is variously interpreted as either a penis or a lizard&#x27;s tail. These figures are found near reliable water sources, and may have been used to mark trade and travel paths between regions. Analysis indicates that the ochres used for the paint originate over 100km southeast of Mount Isa. Davidson suggests that, like the Mount Isa stone axes, the ochre was valued for cultural reasons in addition to functional, economic reasons. This, combined with dating marking the anthropomorphs and stone axes as contemporaneous at about 1000 BP, suggests that they were all intertwined components of an extensive trade network stretching across the entire Lake Eyre Basin.

Some rock art depicting figures and hands in the Mount Isa region, including some of the north-west central Queensland anthropomorphs, have only three fingers. The reason is unclear, but it may have a connection to the later observed common practice among Kalkadoon women of amputation of the little finger. Though Mount Isa was a centre for trade, fundamental stylistic differences suggest that there was little to no artistic exchange between the Mount Isa region and surrounding regions, aside from the anthropomorphs.

Mount Isa is located on the traditional land of the Kalkadoon people. The endemic language of the area was Kalkatunga (also known as Kalkadoon, Kalkadunga, Kalkatungu).

The Kalkadoon people first came into contact with advancing European pastoralists and miners in the mid 1860s, following the Burke and Wills expedition to the Cape York Peninsula in 1861. As settlers and prospectors pressed further into their lands the Kalkadoon set out on one of Australia&#x27;s most successful guerrilla wars, now known as the Kalkadoon Wars which took place from about 1871 to 1884. Their success continued until at Battle Mountain in 1884, when Kalkadoon people killed five Native Police and a prominent pastoralist. Only 29 Kalkadoon people survived. In response, the Queensland Government sending a large contingent of heavily armed patrols who chased surviving tribe members. It is estimated that 900 Kalkadoon people were killed during this six-year campaign. There is now a memorial near the site of the Black Mountain.

In 1923, a lone prospector, John Campbell Miles, stumbled upon one of the world&#x27;s richest deposits of copper, silver and zinc during an expedition into the Northern Territory. When Miles inspected the yellow-black rocks in a nearby outcrop, they reminded him of the ore found in the Broken Hill mine that he had once worked at. Upon inspection these rocks were weighty and heavily mineralised. A sample sent away to the assayer in Cloncurry confirmed their value. Miles and four farmers staked out the first claims in the area. Taken with friend&#x27;s stories of the Mount Ida gold mines in Western Australia, Miles decided upon Mount Isa as the name for his new claim.Mount Isa Post Office opened on 1 August 1924.A location for the town&#x27;s hospital was chosen in 1929, with a small building completed the following year. In 1931, a larger structure was moved to the site from the closed mining town of Kuridala.In 1970, Queen Elizabeth II, The Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Anne toured Australia including Queensland. The Queensland tour began on Sunday 12 April when the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; entered Moreton Bay at Caloundra, sailing into Newstead Wharf. After visiting Brisbane and Longreach next on the tour was Mount Isa and while there the royals were driven to Kalkadoon Park where the royal couple witnessed a programmed event under the guidance of Ringmaster Mr. J. O’Shea. Kalkadoon Park was the original site of the famous Mount Isa rodeo. The following day, on 16 April, the Duke of Edinburgh was taken on an underground tour of the Mount Isa mine while Queen Elizabeth stayed above ground. The Marshalling Area around R62 Shaft Winder Tower was cleaned, and a display was set up using operational mining equipment from underground so Queen Elizabeth II could see it in action. The display was designed to demonstrate the operation of an EIMCO air powered rail mounted rocker shovel loading ore.The Mount Isa City Library opened in 1974.

On 9 June 2000, the first torch relay in Queensland for the Sydney 2000 Olympics reached Mount Isa.

In 2008, plans were made to build a massive motor sports complex on the city&#x27;s north-eastern outskirts, but as of 2024 it had not been built.

In 2008, a Queensland Health report found that more than 10% of children in Mount Isa had blood lead levels above World Health Organization recommendations. The mining operator Glencore denied responsibility and stated that the town has naturally high levels of lead in the soil. However, a more recent study led by Macquarie University environmental engineers has used lead isotope analysis to show conclusively that the lead ingested had originated from smelted ore and not surface deposits.

In 2015, Mt Isa formed its own Symphony Orchestra, acclaimed as the &quot;most remote in the world&quot;. Inaugurated on 23 July 2015, the event attracted several stars of the music world, including world-famous jazz musician James Morrison. Morrison also figured in the premiere of Matthew Dewey&#x27;s &#x27;Symphony of the Inland Sea&#x27;, composed for the occasion.

On 5 March 2017, Mount Isa was chosen as a host city of the 2018 Commonwealth Games Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay, along with Cloncurry, Hughenden, Winton and Birdsville. The baton passed through the Mount Isa CBD and suburbs and regions en route before the opening ceremony on the Gold Coast.

== Demographics ==
In 2008, a rumour circulated that the ratio of males to females living in Mount Isa was five to one. Former Mayor John Molony drew international press attention in August 2008 when he told the Townsville Bulletin newspaper that Mount Isa&#x27;s gender imbalance made it a good place for &quot;not so attractive&quot; women to live. However, the revealed that 52.8% of residents were male and 47.2% were female.

In the , the town of Mount Isa had a population of 18,342 people.

The mayor of Mount Isa, after the 2020 Local Government Elections, is Danielle Slade. The City of Mount Isa LGA jurisdiction, covering 43,188 km2 (2nd largest in Australia), is the 15th largest in the world in terms of area and takes in the border town of Camooweal, to the north-west of Mount Isa and from the border of the Northern Territory.

== Economy ==
Mount Isa&#x27;s industry is largely dependent on mining. Glencore operates the Mount Isa Mines lease adjacent to the city, which comprises the &quot;Enterprise&quot; underground copper mine, X41 underground copper mine, &quot;Black Star Open Cut&quot; silver-lead zinc mine, and metallurgical processing facilities. Silver-lead-zinc ore is also mined to the north at Hilton from the &quot;George Fisher&quot; underground mine, and the adjoining &quot;Handlebar Hill&quot; open cut, which is trucked back to Mount Isa for processing.

Mount Isa is in the top two of the largest copper mining and smelting operations in the country.
Copper and lead are smelted on site, with copper anodes and zinc concentrate being transported to the city and port of Townsville on the east coast. The lead ingots are transported to a refinery in Britain where the silver is extracted. The mine is the most significant landmark in the area, with the stack from the lead smelter (built 1978), standing 270 m tall, visible from all parts of the city and up to out.

Spinifex State College opened on 1 January 2003. The Junior campus is located at the former Mount Isa State High School. The Senior campus is located at the former Kalkadoon State High School. The Mount Isa Education and Training Precinct campus is an amalgamation of Kalkadoon State High School and Mount Isa State High School to form Spinifex State College Precinct.
Mount Isa is also home to the School of the Air, a unique-to-Australia way of schooling isolated students in Australia&#x27;s vast lightly populated country areas. The city also holds the main campus of the Mount Isa Institute of TAFE, offering courses in a wide range of fields, including mining, agriculture and trades. In addition, James Cook University has a presence, with the Mount Isa Centre for Rural and Remote Health in the Base Hospital complex.

== Water infrastructure ==

Mount Isa&#x27;s water is supplied from Lake Moondarra, from Mount Isa, and from Lake Julius, from Mount Isa. As it costs approximately twice as much to supply water from Lake Julius, the water is normally drawn from Lake Moondarra. However, during periods of drought, it becomes necessary to draw water supplies from Lake Julius. The three major water users are the Mount Isa Mines, Incitec Pivot and the Mount Isa City Council (which in turn supplies residents and smaller businesses).

Due to a prolonged drought, water levels in Lake Moondarra have become very low. In April 2013, it was forecast that Lake Moondarra would be reduced to 40% of capacity by July 2013, which would trigger the need to supply additional water from Lake Julius. The increased cost to the Mount Isa Council for water was estimated to be $800,000 per year ($114 each for 7000 households). Water restrictions in the town were escalated in April 2013 to reduce water consumption. Boating on Lake Moondarra would be restricted if water levels reduced to 20% for safety reasons as the lower water levels would reveal obstructions. The fish in the lake will be at risk if Lake Moondarra falls to 10% capacity.

Water has traditionally been processed using a natural filtration process involving reed beds in a large isolated lagoon, which, after disinfecting, produced water to acceptable standards under the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. However, the prolonged drought has produced climatic conditions that have caused blooms of blue-green algae in Lake Moondarra, Lake Julius and the Clear Water Lagoon, necessitating the temporary introduction of a large filtration plant to remove the algae.

== Amenities ==
The City of Mount Isa operates a public library in Mount Isa at 23 West Street which utilizes a high - speed ISDN Internet Connection (powered through the National Broadband Network) to both Townsville and Brisbane.

Mount Isa also has a cinema complex, situated in the inner city on Rodeo Drive, that contains three air-conditioned cinemas, a skate park/aquatic centre and a multi-purpose sporting complex for basketball and other indoor sports. Mount Isa&#x27;s events complex, Buchanan Park, opened in May 2007, can hold up to 6,000 people and is used for special events such as concerts and expos. It is also the home of the city&#x27;s annual show and rodeo.

The city is known for its annual Rodeo and Mardi Gras street parade every August. There is also an annual Multicultural Festival in early September.

The local theatre group, the Mount Isa Theatrical Society, also known as MITS, often holds plays and musicals, at least once every few months.

Athletics, gymnastics, tennis, rugby league, field hockey, football, netball, rugby union, cricket, and Australian rules are the most common sports but shooting, squash, softball, basketball, BMX racing, and ten-pin bowling are also present. Mount Isa has a Go Kart Club situated off Duchess Road on the southern side of town.

== Tourism ==

Attractions include the Hard Times Mine at &quot;Outback at Isa&quot; and The Mount Isa Rodeo and Mardi Gras (held on the same weekend) has given Mount Isa the title of &quot;Rodeo Capital of Australia&quot;. The occasion may well triple the city&#x27;s population in these few days. A memorial has been made especially for the Rodeo, down Rodeo Drive; the sidewalks have special memorials embedded in the cement.

The burial place of John Campbell Miles, the founder of Mount Isa, is on the corner of Rodeo Drive and Miles Street. His ashes are buried underneath a large statue where each panel represents a significant part of Mount Isa. Miles&#x27; ashes used to be watched over by a large clock where the statue now stands.

The World War II-era Mount Isa Underground Hospital is an historical building that has been registered on the Register of the National Estate and the Queensland Heritage Register. It is an air-raid shelter which could function as a hospital. It was created as a precautionary measure after Darwin was bombed in 1942. Local miners excavated the site which remains today as the only underground health facility in Queensland which was built during World War II.

<doc id="588698" wikidata="Q16403" url="?curid=588698" title="And Now for Something Completely Different">
<text>And Now for Something Completely Different is a 1971 British sketch comedy film based on the television comedy series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; featuring sketches from the show&#x27;s first two series. The title was taken from a catchphrase used in the television show.

The film, released on 28 September 1971 in the United Kingdom and 22 August 1972 in the United States, consists of 90 minutes of sketches and animation sequences seen in the first two series of the television show. All of the sketches were recreated for the film without an audience, and were intended for an American audience which had not yet seen the series. The announcer (John Cleese) appears briefly between some sketches to deliver the line &quot;and now for something completely different&quot;, in situations such as being roasted on a spit and lying on top of a desk in a small pink bikini, as well as the Colonel (Graham Chapman) interrupting them and deeming them &quot;too silly&quot;.

==Sketches==
#&quot;How Not to Be Seen&quot; (originally seen in Series 2, Episode 11 of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;): A parody of a government film which first displays the importance of not being seen, then devolves into various things being blown up, much to the amusement of the narrator (John Cleese). The narrator eventually composes himself, says &quot;And now for something completely different&quot;, and finds himself being blown up.
#&quot;Animation – Main Titles&quot;: Animated by Terry Gilliam.
#&quot;Man with a Tape Recorder up His Nose&quot; (S1, E9): Immediately following the main title sequence, a screen appears announcing &quot;The End&quot;. An emcee (Terry Jones) steps onto the stage, explains that the cinema overestimated the film length and announces an interval. In the meantime, two short films are shown – one starring a man (Michael Palin) with a tape recorder up his nose (which plays &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;) and another starring a man with a tape recorder up his &quot;brother&#x27;s&quot; (Graham Chapman) nose (with a brief &quot;stereo&quot; segment at the end of the second film, in which &quot;both&quot; tape recorders are played slightly out of sync).
#&quot;Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook&quot; (S2, E12): A Hungarian gentleman (Cleese) enters a tobacconist&#x27;s shop and reads from his phrasebook the declaration: &quot;I will not buy this record, it is scratched&quot; (believing it to be a request for cigarettes). Through similar non-sequiturs, he and the proprietor (Jones) manage to arrange the purchase of a packet of cigarettes, until the Hungarian&#x27;s phrasebook-guided English devolves into sexual innuendo (&quot;Do you want to come back to my place, bouncy-bouncy?&quot;). The incident takes a dramatic turn as the tobacconist uses the phrase book to translate the cost into Hungarian – &quot;costs 6 and 6&quot; (&quot;Yandelavasa grldenwi stravenka&quot;) – and is rewarded with a right cross. The Hungarian gentleman is swiftly arrested for assault, but is released and the author (Palin) of the fraudulent phrasebook is arrested instead. At the author&#x27;s trial, the prosecutor (Eric Idle) claims that in the book the Hungarian phrase meaning &quot;Can you direct me to the station?&quot; is translated by the English phrase, &quot;Please fondle my buttocks&quot;, which leads to the film&#x27;s first exclusive link, in which another Hungarian (Jones) uses the aforementioned inappropriate English phrase to a local gentleman (Chapman), who then gives him proper directions to the station.
#&quot;Animation – Land of Hands&quot; (S2, E3): An animation depicting cut-out hands as plants and animals.
#&quot;Animation – A Shaver&#x27;s Suicide&quot; (S2, E1): An older man puts shaving cream all over his own head and cuts it clean off.
#&quot;Marriage Guidance Counsellor&quot; (S1, E2): Arthur and Deidre Pewtey (Palin and Carol Cleveland) attend an appointment with a marriage guidance counselor (Idle), who ignores Arthur&#x27;s rather tedious explanation of their situation and openly flirts with Deidre, eventually telling Arthur to leave the room so that he can make love to the man&#x27;s wife. Initially depressed by this turn of events, Mr. Pewtey is berated by a heavenly voice (Cleese), who tells Arthur to &quot;pull his finger out&quot; and thus bolsters his self-confidence... but his attempt to take command of the situation fails miserably, ultimately leading to a 16-ton weight being dropped on top of him.
#&quot;Animation – The Carnivorous Pram&quot; (S1, E2): A man pushes a baby carriage that devours two old ladies, until a third victim is saved by the intervention of an irate viewer (the hand of Gilliam and the voice of Connie Booth) – who reaches into the screen, turns the carriage around, and sets it to attack its owner instead. The old lady is carted away by truck, and replaced by a statue: Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;.
#&quot;Animation – David&#x27;s Leaf&quot; (S1, E6): An animated arm tries to remove the fig leaf protecting the aforementioned statue&#x27;s modesty, and after a brief struggle, succeeds, revealing – not the expected male genitals, but the head of an old woman (voiced by Booth) who demands smut like this not be shown on screen.
#&quot;Nudge Nudge&quot; (S1, E3): In a bar, a man (Idle) pesters another man (Jones) about his wife, with a relentless stream of unsubtle sexual innuendos. It turns out that he simply wants to know, &quot;What&#x27;s it like?&quot;
#&quot;Self-Defence Against Fresh Fruit&quot; (S1, E4): In a self-defence course, a sergeant major (Cleese) teaches his students (Chapman, Jones, Palin, and Idle) how to defend themselves from an attacker armed with fresh fruit. This sketch begins with a nun (Gilliam, dubbed by Booth) saying &quot;Well, I think it&#x27;s overrated&quot; in response to the previous sketch – another link that is exclusive to this film. (NOTE: This version is much shorter than the original TV version.)
#&quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Warning&quot; (S1, E8): An uptight Colonel (Chapman) warns the film not to get silly again after the above sketch, and orders the director to cut to a new scene.
#&quot;Hell&#x27;s Grannies&quot; (S1, E8): A documentary report about disaffected urban behavior, which includes &quot;Hell&#x27;s Grannies&quot; (antisocial old ladies), &quot;Baby Snatchers&quot; (men dressed as babies, who seize random people off the street) and vicious gangs of &quot;Keep Left&quot; signs, at which point the Colonel stops the sketch for becoming &quot;too silly&quot;.
#&quot;Camp Square-Bashing&quot; (S2, E9): An army platoon performs precision drilling (also called &quot;square-bashing&quot;) in a highly effeminate manner, which the Colonel again finds silly (&quot;and a bit suspect, I think&quot;) and replaces with a cartoon.
#&quot;Animation – The Prince and the Black Spot&quot; (S2, E6): An animation depicts a prince getting a spot on his face, foolishly ignoring it and dying of cancer. The spot then goes out to seek its fortune and marries another spot.
#&quot;Kilimanjaro Expedition&quot; (S1, E9): Arthur Wilson (Idle) goes to Sir George Head (Cleese) to join an expedition to Mt. Kilimanjaro, but the interview rapidly descends into chaos due to Head&#x27;s unusual case of double vision and another member of the expedition (Chapman) trashing the office. The scene ends when Head is startled to see the next scene coming, as it presumably looks to him like a young woman with &quot;four&quot; breasts.
#&quot;Girls in Bikinis&quot; (S2, E9): Sexy young women are seen posing in bikinis to the sound of lecherous male slavering, which ends abruptly when the camera pans to Cleese reclining on a desk in a pink bikini and bow tie saying the phrase, &quot;And now for something completely different.&quot;
#&quot;Wanna Come Back to My Place?&quot; (S1, E13): A man (Palin) tells a police inspector (Cleese) of a theft, and after an awkward silence, decides to invite said policeman to come back to his place, presumably for sex. After a moment, the policeman agrees and follows the man off.
#&quot;The Flasher&quot; (S1, E8): A man (Jones) in a grubby raincoat appears to be flashing his naked body to women on the streets. He then does the same to the camera, revealing he is fully clothed, and hanging round his neck is a sign saying &quot;Boo!&quot;
#&quot;Animation – American Defense/Ads&quot; (S2, E11): A middle-aged secretary is consumed by hordes of yellow creatures resembling Chinese soldiers during the Cultural Revolution. The segment turns into a series of propagandist advertisements for American Defense, Crelm Toothpaste and Shrill Petrol. This segment abruptly ends when the advertiser for Shrill Petrol (voiced by Palin) is shot off-screen while overstating the effectiveness of his product.
#&quot;Animation – You&#x27;ll Never Take Me Alive, Copper!&quot; (S1, E6): The murderer of the Shrill Petrol advertiser hides himself in a trashcan, but is subdued when the police drop a 16-ton weight upon him, which leads to the 20th Century Frog and MGM-spoofing logos that introduce the next item. (NOTE: This animation was for &quot;20th Century Vole&quot; in the original TV version.)
#&quot;Animation – Conrad Poohs and His Dancing Teeth&quot; (S2, E10): An animated photograph of Gilliam, in which his teeth dance to the music of Josef Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Under the Double Eagle&quot;.
#&quot;Musical Mice&quot; (S1, E2): Ken Ewing (Jones) has &quot;musical&quot; mice, reputedly trained to squeak at specific pitches. He announces they will play &quot;Three Blinded White Mice&quot;, but he simply starts hitting them with huge mallets while humming the tune himself. His audience is enraged and chases him out of the nightclub.
#&quot;It&#x27;s the Arts&quot; (S1, E1): The audience chases Ewing into a television studio, interrupting a talk show (presented by Idle) in which an interviewer (Cleese), attempting to create a rapport, calls his subject – film director Sir Edward Ross (Chapman) – increasingly inappropriate nicknames: &quot;Ted&quot;, &quot;Eddie Baby&quot;, &quot;pussycat&quot;, &quot;angel drawers&quot;, and &quot;Frank&quot;... claiming &quot;President Nixon had a hedgehog named Frank.&quot; When he finally starts using less questionable names for his guest and the guest is finally convinced to discuss his latest film, he quickly tells him to shut up... at which point Ken Ewing reappears in the studio, still being chased by the angry mob, and escapes through an exit onto the streets.
#&quot;Seduced Milkmen&quot; (S1, E3): A milkman (Palin) gets seduced at the door of a house by a lovely woman (Cleveland), and follows her inside, only to get locked in a room with other milkmen, &quot;some of whom are very old.&quot;
#&quot;The Funniest Joke in the World&quot; (S1, E1): Ernest Scribbler (Palin), who is shown writing the revelation to the previous sketch and discarding it, has a sudden inspiration and writes a &quot;lethal&quot; joke – anyone hearing or reading it will literally &quot;die laughing&quot;. It is acquired by the British army who translate it into German, creating a devastating weapon that wins World War II. (NOTE: This sketch is considerably shorter than in its original TV version.)
#&quot;Animation – Old Lady Waiting for the Bus&quot; (S2, E9): In another link exclusive to this film, an animated man (based on a portrait of Henry VII of England, voiced by Cleese) attempts to apologize for the poor taste of the previous item, but is distracted by an animated woman flashing her nude body to him, and departs (on his fingers) to chase after her. An old woman then arrives on the scene and attempts to catch a bus, but it drives past. A second bus comes along, but it, too, drives past. When a third bus comes, the woman trips it with her foot and flips it over so she can board it.
#&quot;Animation – The Killer Cars&quot; (S2, E9): In an overzealous attempt to curb overpopulation, cars turn vicious and begin eating people. Eventually, a giant mutant cat is created to deal with this menace. This plan works perfectly – the city is saved – until the cat starts eating buildings. Another exclusive bit to this film alludes to a cataclysmic battle against the giant mutant cat occurs off-screen, narrated by an old man (Idle) who describes it as &quot;a scene of such spectacular proportions that it could never in your life be seen in a low budget film like this... if you notice, my mouth isn&#x27;t moving, either.&quot;
#&quot;Animation – Dancing Venus&quot; (S1, E8): The mutant cat from the previous animation falls into a sausage grinder, with a number of other animals. The resulting &quot;product&quot; leads into the hair of Botticelli&#x27;s Venus, who stands on her shell... until an arm comes out of the water and twists her nipple like a radio knob. Upbeat music plays, and Venus dances wildly until her exertions cause the shell to tip over, leading to (by way of Venus falling into a fish tank)...
#&quot;The Dead Parrot&quot; (S1, E8): Eric Praline (Cleese) attempts to get a refund for his deceased parrot, but the shopkeeper (Palin) refuses to acknowledge the parrot&#x27;s passing on. In another sketch that proves to be much shorter than its original TV counterpart, a twist ending has the shopkeeper revealing that he never wanted to be a pet shop owner, he always wanted to be... &quot;A LUMBERJACK!&quot;
#&quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot; (S1, E9): The shop owner (Palin) sings about his desire to be a lumberjack, as well as his tendencies toward transvestism, the latter a revelation that both surprises and dismays his best girl (Booth) and the background singers (nine Canadian Mounties – five of whom are Chapman, Cleese, Idle, Jones and Gilliam), who ultimately storm off in disgust and pelt him with rotten fruit. As the owner leaves in defeat, in another link exclusive to this film, he passes by a group of old ladies roasting Cleese on a spit, who once again proclaims, &quot;And now for something completely different.&quot;
#&quot;The Dirty Fork&quot; (S1, E3): The employees of a restaurant (Jones, Palin, Idle, and Cleese) react with ever-increasing melodrama to a dirty fork given to a dining couple (Cleveland and Chapman), resulting in the horrible death of the head waiter (Idle) as well as an insane attack by the chef (Cleese). After a brief mêlée, a punchline is then shown, in which Chapman turns to the camera and says &quot;Lucky that I didn&#x27;t tell them about the dirty knife!&quot;
#&quot;Animation – Musical Interlude&quot; (S1, E2): A picture of Rodin&#x27;s &quot;The Kiss&quot; appears, with the addition of several small holes along the woman&#x27;s leg. The woman straightens her leg out, and the man plays her like an ocarina.
#&quot;Animation – How to Build Certain Interesting Things&quot; (exclusive to this film): Garbage is dropped on a stage and banged repeatedly with a hammer. It takes on the shape of a wheeled arm holding a gun, which rolls into the next scene.
#&quot;Bank Robber&quot; (S1, E10): A bank robber (Cleese) mistakes a lingerie shop for a bank, and attempts to rob it. After the shop owner (Idle) stymies his hopes of stealing large quantities of money, the robber is somewhat put out by his error, and makes do with a pair of panties.
#&quot;River Link&quot; (exclusive to this film): Cleese walks through a river to reach his desk and state (for the last time in the film), &quot;And now for something completely different.&quot;
#&quot;People Falling Out of High Buildings&quot; (S1, E12): An office worker (Idle) sees people falling past the window, but his co-worker (Cleese) is uninterested, until they realize there is a board meeting occurring up stairs and wager whether Parkinson will be next. A man played by Chapman then writes a letter of complaint, but just as he writes &quot;I have worked in tall buildings all my life, and have never once--&quot;, an unknown force propels him screaming out of a tall building.
#&quot;Animation – The Metamorphosis&quot; (S2, E4): A grimy-looking caterpillar in a trenchcoat with human-like features goes to sleep and wakes up as an effeminate male butterfly.
#&quot;Animation – The Three People&quot; (exclusive to this film): Three people walk in snow and then, one at a time, sing the title of the next sketch in harmony (sung by Jones, Palin, and Cleese).
#&quot;Vocational Guidance Counselor&quot; (S1, E10): Herbert Anchovy (Palin) no longer wants to be a chartered accountant, and harbors dreams of being... &quot;A LION TAMER!&quot; The counselor (Cleese) suggests that Anchovy should instead work his way up to lion taming, via banking, an idea which Herbert initially rejects, until he is informed that the animal he thinks is a lion is in fact an anteater, and mere stock footage of a lion scares the life out of him. He desperately cries out that he just wants to see his name in lights, and his wish is granted by a magic fairy (Idle in drag with a mustache).
#&quot;Blackmail&quot; (S2, E5): Herbert is initially mystified by his sudden role of hosting the television show &quot;Blackmail&quot;, in which he threatens various citizens with revealing sensitive information dealing with their sex lives unless they pay him increasingly large sums of money. He gets into the idea very quickly, performing his new, albeit questionable, duty with enthusiasm and panache. (NOTE: Terry Jones makes his debut here as the nude organist, after Terry Gilliam had previously performed the role on the TV show.) 
#&quot;The Battle of Pearl Harbor&quot; (S1, E11): The silly-hating Colonel appears again (having called in to the previous sketch due to being one of its target victims), and introduces a group of women who are members of the Batley&#x27;s Townswomen&#x27;s Guild (the Pythons in drag) – led by one Rita Fairbanks (Idle) – who re-enact the attack on Pearl Harbor... or, rather, beat each other with their handbags while rolling in mud.
#&quot;Romantic Interlude&quot; (S1, E5): Brian and Elspet (Jones and Cleveland) begin ravishing each other on a bed, and several suggestive images are shown (an industrial chimney collapse shown in reverse, a train entering a tunnel, a torpedo being fired, etc.), but the images are actually only films being played by Brian, on a projector propped on the bed. Elspet testily asks whether he is actually going to do something or just show films all night. Brian replies with &quot;Just one more, dear&quot;, and proceeds to show the next and final sketch.
#&quot;Upper Class Twit of the Year&quot; (S1, E12): Five mentally deficient members of the landed gentry go through a challenging obstacle course, with such events as: walking along a straight line; jumping over a wall made of two rows of matchboxes; and slamming a car door loudly. The winner will be the first competitor to shoot himself in the head. (In the process, one twit is so inept that while attempting to back up a car, he somehow manages to run himself over.)
#&quot;Animation – End Titles&quot;: The end credits, rendered in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s typically absurd style. The various &quot;characters&quot; seen in the credits are taken from various other animations that were seen in the series.

==Cast==
Each playing various characters:
* Graham Chapman
* John Cleese – announcer
* Terry Gilliam – animations
* Eric Idle
* Terry Jones
* Michael Palin
* Carol Cleveland
* Connie Booth

==Origins of phrase==
The origin of the phrase is credited to Christopher Trace, founding presenter of the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, who used it (in all seriousness) as a link between segments.

Many of the early episodes of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; feature a sensible-looking announcer (played by John Cleese) dressed in a black suit and sitting behind a wooden desk, which in turn is in some ridiculous location such as behind the bars of a zoo cage or in mid-air being held aloft by small attached propellers. The announcer would turn to the audience and announce &quot;and now for something completely different&quot;, launching the show&#x27;s opening credits starting with the second series of the show.

The phrase was also used as a transition within the show. Often it would be added to better explain the transition, for instance, &quot;And now for something completely different: a man with a tape recorder up his &quot;brother&#x27;s&quot; nose&quot;.

==Production==
===Background===
&quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot; is the Pythons&#x27; first feature film, composed of some well-known sketches from the first two series of the Flying Circus, including the &quot;Dead Parrot&quot; sketch, &quot;The Lumberjack Song&quot;, &quot;Upper Class Twit of the Year&quot;, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Grannies&quot;, the &quot;Nudge Nudge&quot; sketch and others. The original sketches were recreated for the film with an extremely low budget, often slightly rewritten and edited. Financed by &quot;Playboy&quot;s UK executive Victor Lownes, it was intended to help Monty Python break into the United States. Although the film was initially unsuccessful at achieving an American breakthrough, it did well financially in the United Kingdom, and later in the United States on the midnight movie circuit, after the Pythons achieved some success there following their first exposure on US television and the release of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;. The group did not consider this film a success, but it enjoys a cult following among Python fans today.

===Production with Lownes===
The film was the idea of entrepreneur Victor Lownes, head of Playboy UK, who convinced the group that a feature film would be the ideal way to introduce them to the US market. Lownes acted as executive producer. Production of the film did not go entirely smoothly. Lownes tried to exert considerably more control over the group than they had been used to at the BBC. In particular, he objected so strongly to one character—&#x27;Ken Shabby&#x27;—that his appearance was removed, although stills from both this and a further cut sketch, &quot;Flying Sheep&quot;, were published in &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book&quot;. Terry Jones and Michael Palin later complained that the vast majority of the film was &quot;nothing more than jokes behind desks.&quot;

Another argument with Lownes occurred when Terry Gilliam designed the opening credits for the film. Because the names of the Pythons were shown in blocks of stone, Lownes insisted that his own name be displayed in a similar manner. Initially, Gilliam refused but eventually he was forced to give in. Gilliam then created a different style of credit for the Pythons so that in the final version of the film, Lownes&#x27; credit is the only one that appears in that way.

John Cleese says when they test screened the film &quot;the audience thought it was terrific and they fell about until they got to forty-five minutes in, and then . . . they stopped laughing.&quot; So the film was recut but audiences again stopped laughing forty five minutes in. They recut it a third time and the audiences stopped after forty five minutes. Cleese attributed this to the fact the film did not have a story.

===Budget===
The film&#x27;s budget was £80,000, 40% of which came from Lownes. This is self-referentially acknowledged in the film&#x27;s Killer Cars animation; the voiceover narration (done by Eric Idle) mentions &quot;a scene of such spectacular proportions that it could never in your life be seen in a low-budget film like this... if you notice, my mouth isn&#x27;t moving, either&quot;. The film was shot on location in England and inside an abandoned dairy (rather than on a more costly soundstage) beginning on 26 October, ten days after recording was completed on the second series, and ending on 9 December 1970. The budget was so low that some effects seen on the television series could not be repeated in the film.

==Release==
===Reception among American audiences===
Reviews for American audiences were mixed (principally because British humour was unfamiliar to American viewers at that time) but mostly positive. When it was released on 22 August 1972, the film had little success at the box office and did not do well until a late 1974 re-release, which was after PBS began showing the original television episodes in the US. It currently has a 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 26 reviews, with an average score of 6.9/10.

===Home media===
The film originally was on DVD in Region 1 from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment; in 2005, it was repacked in a new collector&#x27;s pack called &quot;And Now For Something Completely Hilarious!&quot; which also features the films &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot;.

<text>Evan Shaw Parker (born 5 April 1944) is a British tenor and soprano saxophone player who plays free improvisation.

Recording and performing prolifically with many collaborators, Parker was a pivotal figure in the development of European free jazz and free improvisation. He has pioneered or substantially expanded an array of extended techniques. Critic Ron Wynn describes Parker as &quot;among Europe&#x27;s most innovative and intriguing saxophonists...his solo sax work isn&#x27;t for the squeamish.&quot;

== Early influences ==
Parker&#x27;s original inspiration was Paul Desmond. Parker soon discovered the music of John Coltrane, who would be the primary influence throughout his career. Other important early influences were free jazz artists Cecil Taylor, Albert Ayler and Jimmy Giuffre. Since the 1990s the influence of cool jazz saxophone players has also become apparent in his music, with Parker recording tributes to Warne Marsh and Lee Konitz on &quot;Time Will Tell&quot; (ECM, 1993) and &quot;Chicago Solo&quot; (Okka Disk, 1997).

== Early career ==
Parker moved to London in 1966 and quickly became a part of the city’s improvised music scene based around the Little Theatre Club, joining John Stevens’ Spontaneous Music Ensemble. Along with guitarist Derek Bailey, he quickly became a leading figure in the improvised music movement in London and throughout Europe. One of his most lasting connections was with German pianist Alexander von Schlippenbach, whose trio he joined in 1970. 

== Solo soprano ==

Parker is perhaps best known for his solo performances. Originally dismissive of solo performance as being too close in nature to traditional composition, he was inspired to experiment with solo performance by the possibilities for musician-instrument interaction demonstrated by Derek Bailey’s solo guitar improvisations. Primarily using the soprano saxophone for these solo performances, the music makes use of a principle known as auditory streaming, where the use of wide registers creates the illusion of polyphony, which Parker terms “pseudo-polyphony”. This effect is achieved primarily by using multiphonics or harmonics in combination with circular breathing, polyrhythmic fingering, and split tonguing.

== Electronic music ==
Working with electronic music since the early days of the Spontaneous Music Ensemble or with his duo with Paul Lytton, Parker has become increasingly interested in electronics, usually through inviting collaborators such as Phil Wachsmann, Walter Prati, Joel Ryan, Lawrence Casserley, Sam Pluta or Matthew Wright to process his playing electronically, creating a feedback loop and shifting soundscape. His various Electro-Acoustic Ensembles are a showcase for this area of his work, as well as the Trance Map project with Matthew Wight, which has included improvised live events across Europe and the US, involving other invited guest performers, with various Trance Map+ recordings released on psi, Intakt and FMR Records.

== Later career and recordings ==

Parker has recorded a large number of albums both solo or as a group leader, and has recorded or performed with Peter Brötzmann, Michael Nyman, John Stevens, Derek Bailey, Keith Rowe, Joe McPhee, Anthony Braxton, Cecil Taylor, John Zorn, Fred Frith, Bill Laswell, Ikue Mori, Thurston Moore, Cyro Baptista, Milford Graves, George E. Lewis, Tim Berne, Mark Dresser, Dave Holland, Sylvie Courvoisier, and many others. Two key associations have been pianist Alexander von Schlippenbach&#x27;s trio with Parker and drummer Paul Lovens (documented on recordings such as &quot;Pakistani Pomade&quot; and &quot;Elf Bagatellen&quot;) and a trio with bassist Barry Guy and drummer Paul Lytton. On Parker&#x27;s 50th birthday, these two bands played a set apiece at a London concert; the results were issued by Leo Records as the &quot;50th Birthday Concert&quot;.

Parker, Bailey, and Tony Oxley founded Incus Records in 1970. The label continued under Bailey&#x27;s sole control after a falling-out between the two men in the early 1980s. Parker curates Psi Records, which is issued by Martin Davidson&#x27;s Emanem Records.

From 1999 to 2007 Parker co-ordinated, recorded and played in the Free Zone at the Appleby Jazz Festival, held in Cumbria, England. The recordings were issued through his Psi record label.

Although Parker&#x27;s focus is free improvisation, he has appeared in conventional jazz contexts, such as Charlie Watts&#x27;s big band and Kenny Wheeler&#x27;s ensembles and participated in Gavin Bryars&#x27;s recording &quot;After the Requiem&quot;, performing the composition &quot;Alaric I or II&quot; as part of a saxophone quartet.

Parker contributed to David Sylvian&#x27;s albums &quot;Manafon&quot; and &quot;Died in the Wool.&quot;

Parker marked his 80th birthday with a three-concert series at Café Oto, London (April 2024) and &quot;The Heraclitean Two-Step, etc.&quot; (4CDs of solo performances with a 120 page book; on False Walls).

== Pop music ==
He also has appeared in pop-music contexts: on Scott Walker&#x27;s &quot;Climate of Hunter&quot;, and on dub-influenced albums with Jah Wobble, the adventurous drum n bass duo Spring Heel Jack and rock group Spiritualized. He appeared on the b-side to Vic Reeves and The Wonderstuff&#x27;s UK 1991 number-one hit &quot;Dizzy&quot;, performing saxophone on &quot;Oh, Mr Songwriter&quot; (based on &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot; TV show end theme song). At one point during a sax solo, Vic can be heard shouting: &quot;Pack it in, Parker!&quot;

Parker has also made notable appearances on record with Robert Wyatt.

<text>Joe McPhee (born November 3, 1939) is an American jazz multi-instrumentalist born in Miami, Florida, a player of tenor, alto, and soprano saxophone, the trumpet, flugelhorn and valve trombone. McPhee grew up in Poughkeepsie, New York, and is most notable for his free jazz work done from the late 1960s to the present day.

==Life and career==
McPhee was born in Miami, Florida, on November 3, 1939. He began playing trumpet when he was eight, before learning other instruments. He played in various high school and then military bands before starting his recording career. His first recording came in 1967, when he appeared on the Clifford Thornton album entitled &quot;Freedom and Unity&quot;. McPhee taught himself saxophone at the age of 32 after experiencing the music of John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and Ornette Coleman. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, McPhee lectured on jazz music at Vassar College.

In 1975, Werner Uehlinger started the Swiss label Hathut Records with the specific intent of showcasing McPhee&#x27;s music. In the 1980s, McPhee met Pauline Oliveros, began studying her musical theories, and worked with her Deep Listening Band. He has not yet signed with any major label in his native United States, and was possibly better known throughout Europe than his native country until the 1990s. His 1996 album &quot;As Serious As Your Life&quot;, which takes its title from the jazz book by Val Wilmer, is &quot;arguably the finest of his solo recordings&quot;, according to the AllMusic review.

Jazz musicians with whom McPhee has recorded or performed include Ken Vandermark, Peter Brötzmann, Evan Parker, Mats Gustafsson, Jeb Bishop, The Thing, Clifton Hyde, Jérôme Bourdellon, Raymond Boni, and Joe Giardullo. Since 1998, McPhee, Dominic Duval, and Jay Rosen have performed and recorded as Trio X. In the 1990s Dominique Eade and McPhee had a jazz ensemble called Naima.

McPhee has written reviews and commentary for &quot;Cadence&quot;.

In 2005, McPhee was awarded the Resounding Vision Award by Nameless Sound.

In 2015, McPhee played a series of 50th anniversary concerts with Canadian noise pioneers Nihilist Spasm Band in three Canadian cities.

<doc id="588708" wikidata="Q30134" url="?curid=588708" title="North Sea Germanic">
<text>North Sea Germanic, also known as Ingvaeonic ( ), is a subgrouping of West Germanic languages that consists of Old Frisian, Old English, and Old Saxon, and their descendants. These languages share a number of commonalities, such as a single plural ending for all persons of the verb, the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law, common changes to the Germanic vowel &quot;*a&quot;, a plural form &quot;-as&quot;, and a number of other features which make scholars believe they form a distinct group within West Germanic.

It is debated whether the shared features of North Sea Germanic are inherited from a common proto-language or formed via later contact and influence. Additionally, the membership of the group is sometimes debated. Some scholars exclude Low German for lacking a number of features associated with North Sea Germanic. Other scholars include Dutch for sharing some features with the group.

==Name==
The name Ingvaeonic derives from ancient Roman sources such as Tacitus, who describes a tribal group called the Ingvaeones. In current scholarship, the term &quot;North Sea Germanic&quot; is often preferred, as it is more descriptive of where these languages are spoken and also more neutral as to whether any connection exists to the Ingvaeones. Other names used include &quot;Coastal Germanic&quot; and &quot;North Sea West Germanic.&quot;

==Membership==
The North Sea Germanic languages are usually defined as consisting of the Anglo-Frisian languages (English and Frisian) and Low German. Scholars debate whether these languages shared a single proto-language, or whether their common features are the result of contact and influence - some of them are also shared with the North Germanic languages. Some features may be common inherited features and others are likely areal features.

The status of Low German in the group is sometimes questioned, but most scholars believe that its oldest attested form, Old Saxon, shows clear North Sea Germanic features. Low German has been steadily influenced by High German, causing it to lose some of its North Sea Germanic features and become a linguistic &quot;hybrid&quot;. Other scholars have argued that Old Saxon was always variable and represents a transitional dialect between North Sea Germanic and &quot;Franconian&quot;. Much variation between North Sea Germanic and Franconian features in the language is dialectal; generally, eastern dialects show more Ingvaeonic phonetic features whereas western ones show more &quot;Franconian&quot; features.

Some scholars have argued that Dutch belongs to the North Sea Germanic languages, as it shares some characteristics with the others. On the other hand, there are arguments for grouping Old Saxon and Old Low Franconian (the ancestor of Dutch) together, as they also share features that are lacking in Anglo-Frisian. Within Dutch, forms that resemble those of the North Sea Germanic languages are called &quot;Ingvaeonisms&quot;. These can can be further divided into older Ingvaeonisms, which are found through Low Franconian, and younger Ingvaeonisms, which are only found in the coastal areas.

==Characteristic phonetic changes==
===lowering of *u===
Through Northwest Germanic (North Germanic and West Germanic), stressed *&quot;u&quot; lowered to &quot;*o&quot; when &quot;*a&quot; was found in the next syllable:
*Proto-West Germanic &quot;*fulką&quot; &gt; Old Norse, Old Saxon, Old High German , Old English &quot;troop, tribe&quot;
However, *&quot;u&quot; was not lowered before a nasal consonant and a following consonant:
*Proto-Germanic &quot;*pundą&quot; &gt; Old Norse, Old English, Old Saxon , Old High German &quot;pound&quot;
In the North Sea Germanic languages and North Germanic, however, &quot;*u&quot; was not lowered before a single nasal consonant, whereas in Old High German, lowering occurred:
*numanaz &gt; Old English , Old Saxon , but Old High German &quot;taken&quot;
Unlowered &quot;*u&quot; is also found in some other environments in northern West Germanic as opposed to Old High German.

===Loss of unstressed and syllable final *z===
All West Germanic languages lost final &quot;-z&quot; in unstressed final syllables (Proto-Germanic &quot;*hundaz&quot; &gt; Proto-West Germanic &quot;*hund&quot;). However, all North Sea Germanic languages and Old Low Franconian also lost syllable-final &quot;z&quot; in unstressed prefixes, whereas High German retained and rhoticized them, thus Old High German vs. Old Saxon &quot;to ask for&quot;.

In northern West Germanic dialects, Germanic word final &quot;-z&quot; was also lost in monosyllables and caused compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel, whereas in southern West Germanic, it became &quot;-r&quot;:
*Proto-Germanic &quot;*hiz&quot; &gt; Old English , Old Frisian/Old Saxon &quot;he&quot; (cf. German with final r)
This same change is attested for most Low Franconian dialects as well (Dutch ); in modern Low Franconian, enclitic forms with a final &quot;-r&quot; are still found in South Low Franconian. Similar enclitic forms are also found in Old Frisian.

===Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law===

Old English, Old Frisian, and Old Saxon all share the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law, in which a nasal is lost before a fricative consonant and the preceding vowel is first nasalized and then lengthened:
*Proto-West Germanic &quot;*fimf&quot; &gt; &quot;*fįf&quot; &gt; Old English, Old Saxon, Old Frisian &quot;five&quot;
*Proto-West Germanic &quot;*gans&quot; &gt; &quot;*gąs&quot; &gt; Old English, Middle Low German, Old Frisian &quot;goose&quot;
Although Old Saxon consistently shows the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law, Middle Low German dialects restore many nasal consonants lost through the spirant law, giving forms such as rather than Old Saxon (&quot;other&quot;). In some words, the presence or absence of the nasal fluctuates by dialect, with modern West Low German mostly having (&quot;us&quot;) while modern East Low German mostly has . Some of these changes may be due to leveling of forms with and without the nasal, while others point to High German influence. High German influence on Low German vocabulary is already visible in the Old Saxon period, as Old Saxon attests words such as and that do not follow the nasal spirant law.

Low Franconian shows some cases of the nasal spirant law through its whole dialect area, most frequently before &quot;f&quot;, e.g. &quot;five&quot;. Other instances are restricted to coastal dialects, such as , used for river mouths in place names and cognate with standard Dutch &quot;mouth&quot;.

Among High German dialects, Central German Ripuarian, Moselle Franconian, and Lorraine Franconian all feature the pronominal form via Ingvaeonic influence. Other &quot;n&quot;-less forms are also found in these dialects, such as islands where the word lacks an &quot;n&quot; (e.g. &quot;wild geese&quot;). Upper Hessian likewise shows . However, most cases have been replaced by forms featuring &quot;n&quot;. The standard German word for south, , represents an early expansion of a word featuring the nasal spirant law into High German (Old High German vs. North Sea Germanic ).

===Nasalization and Rounding===
Throughout North Sea Germanic, &quot;*a&quot; was nasalized in unstressed positions when before a nasal consonant. Additionally, West Germanic *a become rounded before a nasal when in stressed position:
* Proto-North West Germanic &quot;*mānō&quot; &gt; Old English/Old English &quot;moon&quot;
*Proto-West Germanic &quot;*langaz&quot; &gt; Old English/Old Frisian &quot;long&quot;
Long *ā was more regularly affected than short *a. Many forms in Old English show variants with both a and o, e.g. ~ (&quot;drank&quot;).

This change is only occasionally attested in Old Saxon with forms such as &quot;hand&quot;. Ringe and Taylor suggest that the lack of consistency with which the rule is either applied or not applied in Old Saxon points to High German dialect influence. By Middle Low German, forms with &quot;a&quot; have come to dominate. However, in cases where the nasal consonant has been lost before a spirant and the &quot;o&quot; lengthened, the &quot;o&quot; remained: Middle Low German &quot;goose&quot; (see e.g. modern Eastphalian ).

Forms with &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;o&quot; are also found in Western Dutch dialects of Hollandic, Flemish, and Zealandic in some cases, e.g. &quot;soft&quot; in medieval Flemish (modern standard Dutch ). These forms appear connected to the related change in Anglo-Frisian and Old Saxon.

===Fronting===
Proto-West Germanic *a was frequently fronted in the ancestor of Old English, less frequently in the ancestor of Old Frisian:
* Proto-West-Germanic &quot;dag&quot; &gt; Old English , Old Frisian &quot;day&quot;
While this change is exceptionless in Old English (all stressed examples of *a became *æ except those that were rounded or nasalized), subsequent developments mean that it is difficult to tell if it was as exceptionless in Old Frisian.

In Old Saxon, the change is only partially attested, producing doublets of words with &quot;a/e&quot; in Old Saxon. In Middle Low German, most of these doublets were eliminated in favor of the &quot;a&quot; version. Of the Old Saxon variants and (&quot;glass&quot;) only is found in Middle Low German.

Some Dutch dialects also show signs of palatalization of &quot;a&quot; to &quot;e&quot;, most often before &quot;sp&quot; and &quot;sk&quot; (e.g. modern standard Dutch , cf. High German ). This has sometimes been claimed to be an Ingvaeonism, although other factors, such as i-umlaut or analogy, can be used to explain most instances.

===Palatalization of velars===
The North Sea Germanic languages show a tendency toward palatalizing velar consonants before front vowels. Old English and Frisian both palatalize the velar consonants &quot;k&quot; and &quot;g&quot; before the front vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot; in many or all cases:
*Proto-West Germanic &quot;*kirika&quot; &gt; Old English (modern English &quot;church&quot;), Old Frisian 
Fulk argues that this change occurred early and possibly in Proto-Anglo-Frisian or even Proto-North Sea Germanic, given evidence of palatalization in Old Saxon. Ringe and Taylor, however, argue that Frisian palatalization differs from the Old English pattern, meaning that the two languages likely experienced palatalization as a parallel development.

Palatalization of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is also common in Old Saxon and Middle Low German. Palatalized &quot;k&quot; is indicated in the orthography by (e.g. , cf. High German ) or in some cases by (e.g. , cf. High German ), while palatalized &quot;g&quot; is indicated by or sometimes (e.g. , cf. High German ). The palatalization of /k/ probably occurred over a wide area and to differing amounts in different dialects; in modern Low German, it has in most but not all cases been reversed to &quot;k&quot;. Outside of many place names, one modern survival is the word (&quot;beetle&quot;), still used in many Low German dialects and equivalent to High German . Earlier &quot;ɡ&quot;, on the other hand, often alternates with &quot;j&quot; or is a palatal fricative in modern Low German German dialects, often including in the environment of back vowels.

===r-metathesis===
Metathesis of sequence of vowel, /r/, and a following consonant has traditionally been considered a North Sea Germanic trait:
*Proto-West Germanic *&quot;brinnen&quot; &gt; Old English , Middle Low German , Old Frisian &quot;burn&quot;
Metathesis of r clusters can be traced in Old English from the 8th century and infrequently in Old Saxon ( &quot;horse&quot; vs. Old High German ) from the 9th century onward. However, metathesis is not frequent in Old Saxon compared to later periods. Among the modern languages it is most frequent in Frisian. From Low German, r-metathesis spread south into the High German area, a process that is seen through the presence of place names with the element rather than &quot;spring&quot;.

R-metathesis is also common in Dutch (cf. Dutch &quot;burn&quot;); however, it appears to have begun in the Flemish area in the 11th century and is thus unconnected to the r-metathesis in Old Saxon or Anglo-Frisian.

===Monophthongization of *au and *ai===
The monophthongization of the Proto-Germanic diphthongs &quot;*au&quot; and &quot;ai&quot; has sometimes been considered a North Sea Germanic trait. A. Campbell regarded the monophthongization of Proto-Germanic &quot;au&quot; to &quot;ā&quot; as one of the chief characteristics of the North Sea Germanic languages, though he also noted that Old Saxon instead has the usual outcome &quot;ō&quot;. However, the reflexes of this diphthong also differs in Old English and Old Frisian: &quot;au&quot; becomes &quot;ēa&quot; in most Old English dialects, via an intermediate stage &quot;ǣo&quot;. &quot;ā&quot; is thus only attested as an outcome in Old Frisian. &quot;ai&quot; becomes &quot;ā&quot; in Old English, but &quot;ē&quot; (probably ) in Old Frisian except under certain phonological circumstances where it became &quot;ā&quot;. Old Saxon again differs, having &quot;ē&quot;, but forms with reflexes similar to those in Frisian and Old English are also found in some early Old Saxon texts, namely &quot;ā&quot; and &quot;ǣ&quot;. Scholars disagree whether Anglo-Frisian originally monophthongized &quot;ai&quot; to &quot;ā&quot;, with Frisian later fronting &quot;ā&quot; to &quot;ǣ&quot;, or whether both languages underwent separate monophthongizations.

Old Saxon always monophthongizes &quot;au&quot; and &quot;ai&quot; to &quot;ō&quot; and &quot;ē&quot;, while most Old Low Franconian also does so unless when there was &quot;i&quot;/&quot;j&quot; in the following syllable, in which case &quot;ai&quot; is retained as a diphthong &quot;ei&quot;. This situation has sometimes been attributed to North Sea Germanic influence. Monophthongization of &quot;au&quot; and &quot;ai&quot; forms an important isogloss within Low Franconian between Low German and most Low Franconian on the one hand, and High German and South Low Franconian on the other. In those latter dialects, &quot;au&quot; and &quot;ai&quot; were instead raised to &quot;ou&quot; and &quot;ei&quot; in most situations. The different dialects thus show the following characteristic differences:
*Proto-Germanic *&quot;augō&quot; &gt; Old English , Old Frisian , Old Saxon/Old Low Franconian &quot;eye&quot;; cf. Old High German 
*Proto-Germanic *&quot;raipaz&quot; &gt; Old Frisian/Old English , Old Saxon (Middle Dutch ) &quot;band&quot;; cf. Old High German 

===i-mutation and syncope of -i after heavy syllables===
Throughout West Germanic, unstressed final short -&quot;i&quot; is lost after heavy syllables (those with long vowels or two consonants). In the North Sea Germanic languages, final &quot;-i&quot; is retained after light syllables, but in Old High German (and Old Norse and Gothic), final &quot;-i&quot; is always lost (with a few exceptions), irrespective of the weight of the previous syllable. This leads to differences between North Sea German forms such as and more southern in different dialects of Old Saxon.

In North Sea Germanic languages, the syncope of final &quot;-i&quot; occurs after i-mutation (Germanic umlaut), the fronting of vowels before &quot;-j/i&quot; (e.g. a &gt; e, o &gt; œ, u &gt; y). This leads to a forms such as Proto-West-Germanic &quot;*gasti&quot; &gt; Old English , Old Frisian vs. Old High German without i-mutation. Old Saxon takes an intermediate position between Anglo-Frisian and Old High German and Old Low Franconian: in Eastern dialects, it sometimes shows i-mutation in such cases (e.g. Old West Germanic *&quot;krafti&quot; &gt; Old Saxon &quot;strength [genitive]&quot;, Proto-West Germanic &quot;*manni&quot; &gt; &quot;men&quot;). In Western Old Saxon dialects, however, i-mutation is only found when &quot;-i&quot; has not been syncopated (thus Old Saxon &quot;guest&quot; and &quot;men&quot;, agreeing with Old High German). Additionally, in Old Saxon only short &quot;a&quot; is affected (as in Old High German and Old Low Franconian), whereas in Anglo-Frisian, long &quot;a&quot; and long and short &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are also affected.

==Shared grammatical characteristics==
===Verbs===
====Unitary plural====

North Sea Germanic languages have generalized the 3rd person plural ending to the 1st and 2nd person in all moods and tenses, developing what is called &quot;unitary plural&quot; (German , Dutch ):
*Present indicative: Old High German &quot;we become&quot;, &quot;you become&quot;, &quot;they become&quot; vs. Old English , Old Frisian , Old Saxon &quot;we/you/they become&quot;
*Present subjunctive: Old High German &quot;may we become&quot;, &quot;may you become&quot;, &quot;may they become&quot; vs. Old English , Old Frisian , Old Saxon &quot;may we/you/they become&quot;
The indicative unitary plural form is general thought to derive from the nasal spirant law&#x27;s effect on the older 3rd person plural ending: &quot;*-anþ&quot; &gt; &quot;-*ąþ&quot; &gt; &quot;-*aþ&quot;. This meant that there was very little difference between the third and second person plural ending (originally &quot;-*iþ&quot;), and lead to their merger and then the replacement of the former first person plural ending via leveling.

In continental West Germanic, the presence or absence of the unitary plural is used to determine whether a dialect belongs to Low German/Low Saxon or to Low Franconian. In Low German, the form of the unitary plural varies by dialect: West Low German retains the indicative ending &quot;-(e)t&quot;, using it rather than the earlier subjunctive ending &quot;-et&quot;, whereas East Low German has generalized the subjunctive ending &quot;-en&quot; to the indicative. Modern Frisian languages likewise maintain a distinct plural ending, but in most varieties it has been reduced to only a vowel. On the other hand, whereas early Middle English still retained a distinct plural ending (&quot;-eth&quot;, &quot;-en&quot;, or &quot;-es&quot; depending on tense and/or dialect), changes in the 14th and 15th centuries resulted in the modern English system without any distinct ending.

====Class III stative weak verbs====

The North Sea Germanic languages have transferred most class III stative weak verbs into class II (-ō-), e.g. Old Saxon , Old English , vs. Old High German &quot;to honor&quot;, where the class III statives have been maintained but their conjugation simplified. However, the North Sea Germanic languages also retain a relic class of three stative class III Germanic weak verbs, namely &#x27;have&#x27; (Old Saxon ), &#x27;say&#x27; (Old Saxon ) and &#x27;live&#x27; (Old Saxon ). These feature an alternation in their present stems between a final &quot;-ja-&quot; and &quot;-ē-&quot; (&lt; &quot;-*ai-&quot;). The forms with &quot;-j-&quot; have undergone West Germanic gemination and Germanic umlaut, whereas those without &quot;-j-&quot; have not. In High German, however, the alternation has been leveled to &quot;-ē-&quot; in all forms, and these verbs thus lack umlaut or gemination (, , ). Low Franconian includes only &#x27;say&#x27; () and &#x27;have&#x27; () in this class, but not &#x27;live&#x27;, which patterns with High German as . The divide between the High German and the North Sea Germanic forms runs through South Low Franconian and is referred to as the &quot;sagen/seggen-line&quot;.

====Changes to class II weak verbs====
In the North Sea Germanic languages, class II Germanic weak verbs (with the thematic vowel &quot;ō&quot;) were altered so that the infinitive, 1st and 2nd person singular, and unitary plural were based on a form &quot;-ōj(a)-&quot;:
*Proto-West-Germanic *&quot;lōkōn&quot; &gt; Old Saxon , Old English &quot;to look&quot; (&quot;-ōj-&quot; contracted to &quot;-i-&quot; in Old English and Old Frisian)
This innovation is always attested in Old English and Old Frisian, but is in competition with the original form in Old Saxon; most likely, Old Saxon originally had the change but it was suppressed under High German influence.

===Nominals===
====Masculine a-stem plurals (plural -s)====
The North Sea Germanic languages developed a new plural form for the a-stem masculine nouns, &quot;-*ōs&quot;. This is reconstructable from Old English &quot;-as&quot; ,Old Saxon &quot;-os&quot;/&quot;-as&quot;, and Old Frisian &quot;-ar&quot; (from a voiced variant &quot;-*-ōz&quot; with rhoticism). As other West Germanic languages seem to attest a plural ending &quot;-ō&quot; (&lt; Proto-Germanic &quot;-ōz&quot;), the precise origins of this new ending are uncertain. Several theories have been advanced, including that it represents a double plural ending &quot;-ōsis&quot;, that it is a Verner variation of final &quot;-*z&quot; (attested in the other languages) caused by secondary stress on the ending, and that it is the result of a cliticized demonstrative &quot;s-&quot; fusing with the ending. 

The three North Germanic languages differ in the extent to which the &quot;-ōs&quot; plural is present. Old English had as the sole pluralization strategy for a-stems, and in the Middle English period, this plural (as &quot;-(e)s&quot;) would come to replace other regular pluralization strategies. Old Saxon attests variants &quot;-os&quot;/-&quot;as&quot; and &quot;-a&quot;. It appears to have originally only had a plural form &quot;-os&quot;, but adopted the alternative ending -&quot;a&quot; under either High German or Low Franconian influence. In the Middle Low German period, &quot;-(e)s&quot; became rare, but is today the most common strategy of pluralization in Low German. Old Frisian had not only &quot;-ar&quot; but also variants &quot;-a&quot; and -&quot;an&quot;. In Old West Frisian, &quot;-ar&quot; was replaced by &quot;-an&quot;/&quot;-en&quot; over the course of the 13th-15th centuries, but &quot;-ar&quot; (as &quot;-er&quot;) remains in East Frisian and in the insular dialects of North Frisian (it was lost in mainland North Frisian).

The origins of the frequent s-plural in modern Dutch are disputed; the ending became common in the Middle Dutch period. In minor Old Low Franconian sources, &quot;-as&quot; plurals such as (&quot;nests&quot;) are attested alongside &quot;-a&quot; plurals, but it is possible that the s-plurals derive from Frisian, Anglo-Saxon, or even Latin influence on the manuscripts: the main sources in Old Low Franconian only attest &quot;-a&quot; plurals. It has variously been argued that the frequent &quot;-s&quot; ending in Middle Dutch originated in language contact with Old French, spreading from the area of Calais into other dialects; that the form originated in coastal dialects and is a native Ingvaeonic feature; or that it originated in eastern dialects under the influence of Old Saxon.

====s/z-stem plurals (plural -er)====
The Germanic z-stem originates with the Proto-Indo-European &quot;-s&quot; stem nouns; in West Germanic the original ending has been lost in the singular and rhoticized to &quot;-r&quot; in the plural. In Proto-West Germanic and Proto-Germanic, these words formed a very small class of exclusively neuter nouns that were mostly terms for young animals such as &quot;*lamb&quot;/&quot;lamberu&quot; &quot;lamb/lambs&quot;. In most High German dialects and part of Low Franconian, the ending &quot;-eru&quot; experienced umlaut of the &quot;e&quot; to &quot;i&quot;, giving an Old High German ending &quot;-ir&quot; that caused i-umlaut (, &quot;calf, calves&quot;) whereas in the other West Germanic languages (including the High German Central Franconian dialects), this did not happen: Old English (West Saxon) , , Middle Low German, Middle Dutch, Middle Franconian , . The absence of umlaut for this plural can thus be considered a North Sea Germanic feature.

Low German and Dutch experienced an expansion of the number of words that take the &quot;-er&quot; plural ending during the Middle Ages, with Low German experiencing a further expansion in the early modern period. In most cases, the words that have joined the plural declension are shared with High German. West Low German &quot;-er&quot; plurals do not show umlaut (e.g. &quot;calves&quot;, &quot;lambs&quot;), but East Low German has generally adopted umlauted forms from High German influence. In Dutch, on the other hand, only 15 &quot;-er&quot; plurals (in the double-plural form &quot;-eren&quot;) still exist. These plurals do not show umlaut except in South Low Franconian (Limburgish). In West Frisian, the ending was lost entirely during the High Middle Ages; Saterland Frisian has extended the use of the ending to a larger class of nouns, probably partially under Low German influence, whereas other dialects have lost it. English, meanwhile has lost the ending entirely except in the double-plural &quot;children&quot;.

====n-stem declension====
Old Norse, Anglo-Frisian and some Old Saxon forms show a common innovation in the genitive/dative ending for n-stem nouns, agreeing with Old Norse:
*Old English , Old Saxon &quot;chicken&quot; (cf. Old Frisian &quot;magistrate&quot;) vs. Old High German (cf. Old Low Franconian &quot;name&quot;), Old Saxon 
In those languages with the innovation, it is assumed that the ending &quot;-an&quot; was extended from the accusative to the dative/genitive.

Stiles explains the fact that Old Saxon has both forms as the &quot;-en&quot; ending coming via Old High German influence, whereas Ringe and Taylor argue that the &quot;-en&quot; form is usual in Old Saxon and that both it and Old High German pattern together in innovating the n-stem declension in a different way than Anglo-Frisian. Kroghe further notes that whereas Anglo-Frisian shows an accusative ending &quot;-a(n)&quot; for the n-stems, Old High German, Old Low Franconian, and most Old Saxon agree in having an ending &quot;-on&quot;.

====Dative plurals====
North Sea Germanic and the North Germanic languages have reduced the dative plural ending of numerous verb classes to &quot;-um&quot;/&quot;-un&quot;, whereas Old High German and Old Low Franconian have retained the older forms:
*Proto-Germanic *-&quot;am&quot;, *-&quot;ōm&quot;, *-&quot;um&quot;, *-&quot;im&quot;, *-&quot;aim&quot; &gt; North Sea Germanic and Old Norse &quot;-um&quot;

====Strong adjective endings====
The North Sea Germanic languages and Old Low Franconian have a zero ending for the nominative singular masculine, feminine, and neuter of strong adjectives (Old English/Old Saxon &quot;good&quot;). This is opposed to Old High German, which had optional endings differentiating gender (Old High German (m.), (f.), and (n.) - the neuter ending reflects a Proto-West Germanic &quot;-at&quot; with the High German consonant shift). Additionally, in North Sea Germanic the neuter plural has no ending, whereas in Old High German, it has an ending &quot;-iu&quot;. It is unclear whether these endings in Old High German, which agree with Old Norse and Gothic, represent a shared innovation in those languages or whether North Sea Germanic languages have lost the endings.

Beginning in Middle Low German, the masculine strong adjective ending &quot;-er&quot; is sometimes imported into Low German; additionally, a few neuter pronouns such as , &quot;everything&quot;, show an equivalent of the High German &quot;-az&quot; ending, &quot;-et&quot;: under High German influence, this ending has spread to adjectives as well. Dutch also has some neuter modifiers or pronouns with the ending &quot;-et&quot; (e.g. &quot;everything&quot;, dialectal &quot;no&quot; (n.)). Additionally, some southern Low Franconian dialects such as Brabantine have an ending &quot;-t&quot; on some monosyllabic adjectives that could come from the old &quot;-at&quot; ending (e.g. &quot;blue&quot;); however, as Brabantine-based Middle Dutch records no such endings, it is more likely that they have been influenced by forms of the word &quot;old&quot; (pronounced with a final &quot;-t&quot;). Limburgish South Low Franconian, on the other hand, has an ending &quot;-t&quot; that is found on some neuter adjectives in predicate and substantivized use and is probably a survival of the original &quot;-at&quot; ending.

====Non-feminine dative singular prononimal/adjectival endings====
In North Sea Germanic, the dative singular strong adjectival and pronominal ending shows a short form ending in &quot;-m&quot; (Old English , Old Frisian , Old Saxon . This ending is probably via analogy with the corresponding ending in the dative plural (&quot;-um&quot;). In Old High German, on the other hand, the dative neuter/masculine singular has a final &quot;-mu&quot; (). Old Saxon shows both the short and long endings, e.g. OS ~ .

===Pronouns===
====3rd person pronouns with h-====
The North Sea Germanic languages and Old Low Franconian share the innovation of using at least some third person singular pronouns that begin with &quot;h-&quot;, Old Frisian, Old Saxon, Old Low Franconian , Old English &quot;he&quot; (cf. Old High German ). Outside of the nominative masculine singular, however, the degree to which &quot;h-&quot; has spread throughout the paradigm varies by language. In Old English, all person and numbers feature initial &quot;h-&quot;, including the creation of a new feminine pronoun &quot;she&quot; and a nominative/accusative plural form &quot;they&quot;. Frisian shows the same extension except that it uses a possessive form for the masculine and neuter singular. In Old Saxon and Old Low Franconian, however, only the masculine nominative features &quot;h-&quot;: , accusative &quot;him&quot;. Masculine nominative forms with initial &quot;h-&quot; are also found in the West Central German dialects bordering Low German and Low Franconian, including transitional forms between and German such as .

====Loss of the 3rd person reflexive pronoun====
Old English, Old Frisian, Old Saxon, and Old Low Franconian (Old Dutch) have lost the original Proto-Germanic 3rd person reflexive pronoun &quot;*sik&quot;, instead using the same pronouns to mean, e.g. &quot;him&quot; and &quot;himself&quot;. However, the High German reflexive pronoun has subsequently been imported into both Low German and standard Dutch. Southwestern, Northwestern, and most Eastern Low Franconian dialects continue to use the same pronoun for both &quot;him&quot; and &quot;himself&quot;. English innovated a new reflexive pronoun using &quot;-self&quot;, whereas Frisian continues to allow the use of the same forms for both personal and reflexive pronouns.

Although they lost the reflexive &quot;*sik&quot;, Old Low Franconian, Old Frisian, and Old Saxon retained the reflexive possessive adjective in the more general meaning &quot;his&quot;, possibly under High German influence. In Old English, is attested in its original meaning &quot;his own&quot;, but only rarely.

====Shared accusative-dative pronominal forms====
The North Sea Germanic languages and Old Franconian share a tendency to replace the accusative forms of the first and second person singular pronouns with their dative equivalents: Old English , , Old Frisian/Old Saxon , . The same tendency is found in Middle Dutch. The original accusative forms are still attested in their original meaning in the Anglian dialect of Old English. Although the loss of distinct accusative/dative pronouns for the first and second person singular had already occurred in Old Saxon, accusative forms are occasionally attested, and they resurface as general forms for both dative and accusative in some dialects of Middle and New Low German. Versloot and Adamczyk argue that the feature appears to be strongest in dialects along the English channel/southern North Sea (Kentish and West Saxon in Old English, northern Low Saxon, Old Low Franconian, Old Frisian) and weakest in those dialects furthest away (Anglian Old English, Eastphalian Low German).

==Shared vocabulary==
The North Sea Germanic languages share a number of vocabulary items that are not found in other West Germanic languages. One example is the partial replacement of Proto-Germanic &quot;*minni&quot; &quot;less&quot; (adverb) with &quot;*laisi&quot;, which is, however, only attested once in Old Saxon. Additionally, the numerals &quot;nine&quot; and &quot;ten&quot; show a common innovation: Proto-Germanic &quot;*newun&quot; &gt; &quot;*nigun&quot; &quot;nine&quot; and Proto-Germanic &quot;*tehundō&quot; &gt; &quot;*tegąþa&quot; &quot;ten&quot; (the latter of which has a more limited distribution). Other words that are unique to North Sea Germanic include:
*Old Saxon , Old English , Middle Dutch , West Frisian &quot;willow&quot;
*Middle Low German , West Frisian , Old English &quot;gudgeon, river goby&quot;
*Low German , English Midlands dialect &quot;twitch(el)&quot; &quot;narrow path&quot;
*Old Saxon , Old English &quot;maple&quot;
A number of North Sea Germanic words are also found in the North Germanic languages, such as:
*Old Saxon , Old English , Old Norse &quot;fire&quot;
*Middle Low German , Old English , Old Frisian , Old Norse &quot;wheel&quot;
*Middle Low German , Old English , Old Norse &quot;roof, cover&quot;

<text>Prince Charles Island is a large, low-lying island in Canada. With an area of , it is the world&#x27;s 77th largest island and the 19th largest island in Canada. It is located in Foxe Basin, off the west coast of Baffin Island, in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. Though Prince Charles Island has no permanent residents, Inuit visited the island to hunt caribou; the island has no specific name in the Inuktitut language. Despite the island&#x27;s size, it was not recorded by Western cartographers until 1932, when the tug captain W. A. Poole first sighted it. His information never made it onto any published map. It was rediscovered in 1948 by Albert-Ernest Tomkinson navigating an Avro Lancaster for the RCAF 408 (Photo) Squadron. The island was named for British Prince Charles (later King Charles III), who was born in November the same year.

<doc id="588721" wikidata="Q28900" url="?curid=588721" title="John G. Kemeny">
<text>John George Kemeny (born Kemény János György; May 31, 1926 – December 26, 1992) was a Hungarian-born American mathematician, computer scientist, and educator best known for co-developing the BASIC programming language in 1964 with Thomas E. Kurtz. Kemeny served as the 13th President of Dartmouth College from 1970 to 1981 and pioneered the use of computers in college education. Kemeny chaired the presidential commission that investigated the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. According to György Marx he was one of The Martians.

== Early life ==
Born in Budapest, Hungary, into a Jewish family, Kemeny attended the Rácz private primary school in Budapest and was a classmate of Nándor Balázs. In 1938 his father left for the United States alone. In 1940, he took the whole Kemeny family to the United States when the adoption of the second anti-Jewish law in Hungary became imminent. His grandfather, however, refused to leave and was killed in the Holocaust, along with an aunt and uncle. Kemeny&#x27;s family settled in New York City where he attended George Washington High School. He graduated with the best results in his class three years later. In 1943, Kemeny entered Princeton University where he studied mathematics and philosophy, but he took a year off during his studies to work on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where his boss was Richard Feynman. He also worked there with John von Neumann. Returning to Princeton, Kemeny graduated with an A.B. in mathematics in 1946 after completing a senior thesis, titled &quot;Equivalent logical systems&quot;, under the supervision of Alonzo Church. He then remained at Princeton to pursue graduate studies and received a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1949 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;Type-theory vs. set-theory&quot;, also under the supervision of Alonzo Church. 

He worked as Albert Einstein&#x27;s mathematical assistant during graduate school. J. Laurie Snell writes the following about Einstein&#x27;s advice to Kemeny and seeing him drawn to the United World Federalists (UWF) Movement:

United World Federalists was the movement through which he met his future wife, then-Smith student Jean Alexander.

==Career==
Kemeny was appointed to the Dartmouth Mathematics Department as a full professor in 1953, at the age of 27. Two years later he became chairman of the department, and held this post until 1967. 
Kemeny ventured into curriculum development when he introduced Finite mathematics courses. He teamed with Gerald L. Thompson and J. Laurie Snell to write &quot;Introduction to Finite Mathematics&quot; (1957) for students of biology and social sciences. The Dartmouth mathematics department professors also wrote &quot;Finite Mathematical Structures&quot; (1959) and &quot;Finite Mathematics with Business Applications&quot; (1962). Other colleges and universities followed this lead and several more textbooks in &quot;Finite Mathematics&quot; were composed elsewhere. The topic of Markov chains was particularly popular so Kemeny teamed with J. Laurie Snell to publish &quot;Finite Markov Chains&quot; (1960) to provide an introductory college textbook. Considering the advances using potential theory obtained by G. A. Hunt, they wrote &quot;Denumerable Markov Chains&quot; in 1966. This textbook, suitable for advanced seminars, was followed by a second edition in 1976 when an additional chapter on random fields by David Griffeath was included.

Kemeny and Kurtz were pioneers in the use of computers for ordinary people. After early experiments with ALGOL 30 and DOPE on the LGP-30, they invented the BASIC programming language in 1964, as well as one of the world&#x27;s first time-sharing systems, the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System (DTSS). In 1974, the American Federation of Information Processing Societies gave an award to Kemeny and Kurtz at the National Computer Conference for their work on BASIC and time-sharing. BASIC was the language used in most software written during the rise of the Apple II, the Commodore, the TRS-80, and the IBM PCs throughout the 80s, and its successor on PCs, Visual Basic (.NET), is still in use in 2023. In 1980s, Sinclair BASIC was also essential for Sinclair ZX family of computers.

Kemeny was president of Dartmouth from 1970 to 1981, and continued to teach undergraduate courses and to do research and publish papers during his time as president. He presided over the coeducation of Dartmouth in 1972. He also instituted the &quot;Dartmouth Plan&quot; of year-round operations, thereby allowing more students without more buildings. During his administration, Dartmouth became more proactive in recruiting and retaining minority students and revived its founding commitment to provide education for American Indians. Kemeny made Dartmouth a pioneer in student use of computers, equating computer literacy with reading literacy. In 1982 he returned to teaching full-time.

In 1983, Kemeny and Kurtz co-founded a company called True BASIC, Inc. to market True BASIC, an updated version of the language.

==Death==

John Kemeny died at the age of 66, the result of heart failure in Lebanon, New Hampshire on December 26, 1992. He had lived in Etna, near the Dartmouth Campus.

<doc id="588726" wikidata="Q1360707" url="?curid=588726" title="Ken Vandermark">
<text>Ken Vandermark (born September 22, 1964) is an American composer, saxophonist, and clarinetist.

A fixture on the Chicago-area music scene since the 1990s, Vandermark has earned wide critical praise for his playing and his multilayered compositions, which typically balance intricate orchestration with passionate improvisation. He has led or been a member of many groups, has collaborated with many other musicians, and was awarded a 1999 MacArthur Fellowship. He plays tenor saxophone, clarinet, bass clarinet, and baritone saxophone.

He was also a member of NRG Ensemble.

==Biography==
=== Boston and Montreal ===
Vandermark grew up in Massachusetts, graduating from Natick High School. His father, Stu Vandermark, was the Boston correspondent for &quot;Cadence Magazine&quot; and currently is a noted essayist on jazz, primarily concerned with improvisation.

Vandermark led a jazz trio, the Fourth Stream, in Montreal while he was an undergraduate at McGill University. He graduated in 1986 with a degree in English but focusing on cinema. After graduation, he led or co-led groups (including Lombard Street and Mr. Furious) in Boston.

Compositions/arrangements for the Boston-based groups set the groundwork for and predicted approaches to recordings and live performances developed in Chicago. Although a trio, Lombard Street incorporated &quot;suite forms&quot; characteristic of later arrangements for groups of both substantial and limited instrumentation. Vandermark&#x27;s &quot;dedication pieces&quot; are found first in Lombard Street performances, as in the case of &quot;The Politics of Sound,&quot; which was dedicated to the musicians in Boston-based ensembles Shock Exchange, The Fringe, and the Joe Morris Trio. Works performed by Mr. Furious, such as &quot;Cold Coffee&quot;, include some of the most convincing early examples of Vandermark&#x27;s signature free-ranging charts. Developed further in Barrage Double Trio (e.g., &quot;Agamemnon Sleeps&quot;) this simultaneously linear and episodic perspective on arrangement broadly has been the overarching architecture in most of his works for large-ensembles since that time.

=== Chicago ===
Vandermark has lived in Chicago since autumn 1989. Since then, he has performed or recorded with many musicians (including Hal Russell, Paal Nilssen-Love, Hamid Drake, Fred Anderson, David Stackenäs, Paul Lytton, Joe Morris, Ab Baars, The Ex, Mikolaj Trzaska, Marcin Oles, Waclaw Zimpel, Axel Doerner, Mats Gustafsson, Bartlomiej Oles, Wolter Wierbos, Joe McPhee, Zu, Peter Brötzmann, Fredrik Ljungkvist, Paul Lovens, Lasse Marhaug, Yakuza, Kevin Drumm, and members of Superchunk). He first gained widespread attention while with the NRG Ensemble from 1992 to 1996. He was once a member of Witches and Devils and the Flying Luttenbachers and has led or co-led several groups, including DKV Trio, Free Fall, Territory Band, CINC, Sonore, the Vandermark 5, the Free Music Ensemble, School Days, the Sound in Action Trio, Steam and Powerhouse Sound.

The &quot;Joe Harriott Project&quot;, a brief celebration of Harriott in 1998 in the Chicago area, consisted of Ken Vandermark (reeds), Jeb Bishop (trombone), Kent Kessler (bass), and Tim Mulvenna (drums). The band played the music of Joe Harriott, transcribed and arranged by Vandermark.

In 2002 Vandermark recorded &quot;Furniture Music&quot;, his first released performances as an unaccompanied soloist.

After several years of Vandermark 5 performances of his arrangements of works by Sonny Rollins, Joe McPhee, Cecil Taylor, and others, Vandermark in 2005 announced, &quot;Though I have learned a great deal by rearranging some of my favorite composers&#x27; work for the Vandermark 5, it&#x27;s time to leave that process behind and focus more completely on my own ideas.&quot;

Vandermark is the subject of &quot;Musician&quot; (2007), one of a series of Daniel Kraus video documentaries on contemporary occupations.

== Awards ==
Vandermark won the &quot;Cadence&quot; magazine poll in 1998 for best artist and best recording. He was a finalist for the 1998 Herb Alpert Fellowship.

In 1999 Vandermark was awarded a $265,000 MacArthur Fellowship, a prize then awarded on an age-based scale to creative leaders and meant to enable them to pursue their creative, intellectual, and professional inclinations. The fellowship was controversial, due to Vandermark&#x27;s relative youth and obscurity: he was 35 and known mostly in Chicago, while other jazz performers awarded the fellowship were older and better-known (e.g., Cecil Taylor, George Russell).

==Groups and collaborations==

In the mid-1990s, Vandermark was known, in part, for his many collaborations with other musicians. Some groups were &quot;ad hoc&quot; settings, while others were more stable. He worked not only in jazz, but free improvisation, noise, rock and roll of various stripes, and other settings. Due in part to wanting to focus more on his own compositions, Vandermark decided in about 2000 to limit his collaborations.

Vandermark is one of the founders and members of Catalytic Sound, a cooperative of musicians that publishes their own recordings.

===DKV Trio===
Composed of drummer Hamid Drake, bassist Kent Kessler, and Vandermark. The group is active only irregularly, except for annual end-of-year concert(s) in Chicago. However, in 2017 DKV played two tours, one with Joe McPhee, and in 2020 there was no end-of-year concert, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Spaceways Inc.===
Ken Vandermark, Hamid Drake, and bassist Nate McBride. Originally devoted to interpretations of the music of Sun Ra and the P-Funk/George Clinton family, Spaceways Inc. later branched into versions of classic reggae songs as well as Vandermark originals.

===The Vandermark 5===
Perhaps Vandermark&#x27;s main compositional vehicle, the Vandermark 5 released their first album in 1997. Initial personnel were Vandermark, Mars Williams (saxophone), Jeb Bishop (trombone and electric guitar, though the latter was gradually phased out), Kessler (bass) and Tim Mulvenna (drums). Williams left and was replaced by saxophonist Dave Rempis; while Tim Daisy took over Mulvenna&#x27;s seat at the drums. Bishop left the group in 2005, and was replaced with cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm.

Their music could be broadly classified as post bop, though their earlier era had strong leanings towards punk rock and noise due to Bishop&#x27;s ragged guitar contributions. In 2010 Vandermark announced the disbanding of the ensemble, although he continues to work with band members in other contexts (e.g., with Kessler in DKV).

===Free Fall Trio===
Active c. 2004–2007, the Free Fall Trio included Vandermark and two Norwegian musicians: pianist Håvard Wiik and bassist Ingebrigt Håker-Flaten. This group was loosely inspired by Jimmy Giuffre&#x27;s groundbreaking early 1960s trio, which featured the same instrumentation. Like Giuffre, Vandermark played clarinet and emphasized a rather hushed and subdued chamber jazz that still managed to swing and take creative leaps.

===Territory Band===
After being awarded the MacArthur Fellowship in 1999, Vandermark used some of the financial windfall to assemble the Territory Band, a big band composed of musicians from North America and Europe. Vandermark describes Territory Band as &quot;an intersection of my two primary musical interests, American Jazz and European Improvised Music.&quot; Personnel has varied but has always included Vandermark, Rempis and Fredrik Ljungkvist on reeds; Axel Dörner on trumpet and Per-Åke Holmlander on tuba; Jim Baker on piano; Kessler on bass and Lonberg-Holm on cello; and Paal Nilssen-Love and Paul Lytton on drums. Territory Band also incorporates elements of noise and electroacoustic improvisation via the contributions of Kevin Drumm, who departed in about 2005 and was replaced by Lasse Marhaug.

===RARA AVIS===
In June 2012, Vandermark recorded &quot;Mutations/Multicellulars Mutations&quot;, the first album by a newly created ensemble called RARA AVIS, featuring Stefano Ferrian (soprano/tenor saxophone), Stefano Quatrana (piano), Luca Pissavini (double bass) and SEC_ (tape recorder, instant sound treatment). The ensemble premiered on April 26, 2013 at Novara Jazz Winter.

===Marker===
Vandermark named his group Marker for filmmaker Chris Marker. In addition to Vandermark, the group, based in Chicago, features the much younger musicians Macie Stewart (violin, keyboard), Steve Marquette (guitar), Andrew Clinkman (guitar), and Phil Sudderberg (drums). Marker&#x27;s album &quot;Wired for Sound&quot; was recorded in 2017 and released in 2018, and a second live album was recorded and released in 2018. Marker toured in 2018. (Since 2017 through 2020, Vandermark and Stewart, often along with , , Sima Cunningham, and Liam Kazar (Cunningham), usually participated in the annual winter performances in Chicago of the Yes We Can Band led by and , which covers New Orleans rhythm &amp; blues/funk tunes, especially those of Allen Toussaint and the Meters.)

===Edition Redux===
Edition Redux formed in Chicago in early 2023, featuring, in addition to Vandermark, the much younger musicians ( (keyboards), (drums), and (tuba, electronics)). Edition Redux&#x27;s album &quot;Better a Rook Than a Pawn&quot;, based on compositions by Vandermark, was released in late 2023. The band did and will tour in 2023 and 2024.

<text>Barnabas Aid is an international, interdenominational Christian aid agency that supports Christians who face discrimination or persecution as a consequence of their faith. It was established in 1993 and channels aid to projects run by national Christians in more than 50 countries. It also campaigns in particular for the abolition of the Islamic apostasy law. Its operational headquarters are in Swindon, Wiltshire, and its registered address as the charity Barnabas Fund is at The Rectory in Pewsey, Wiltshire.

In 2015, founder Patrick Sookhdeo resigned as leader of the charity after he was found guilty of sexual assault and intimidating witnesses. He later started working again for the charity as an adviser and later again as international director.

In early 2024, Barnabas Aid commissioned an external investigation by law firm Crowell &amp; Moring into &quot;allegations made by multiple whistle-blowers against the Barnabas founder, Patrick Sookhdeo, and other senior leaders within the organisation&quot;. In April 2024, several senior leaders were suspended pending the investigation. in June 2024, the international chief executive, Noel Frost, was dismissed.

In September 2024, the Charity Commission opened a statutory inquiry into Barnabas Aid, and banned it from making payments over £4,000. There had been allegations of excessive spending on corporate payment cards, including on flights to Las Vegas, and inappropriate payments to trustees. There was concern there could be an unexpected £15 million overspend in charity finances.

In January 2025, the Charity Commission extended its investigation into four further charities linked to Barnabas Aid: TBF Trust, Oxford Centre for Religion in Public Life, Reconciliation Trust and Servants Fellowship International. Trustees of the organisation&#x27;s international board have ordered an independent investigation. The charity has admitted it has let supporters down through a situation which has been described by those within as ‘chaos’.

<doc id="588734" wikidata="Q548576" url="?curid=588734" title="The Castle of Otranto">
<text>The Castle of Otranto is a novel by Horace Walpole. First published in 1764, it is generally regarded as the first Gothic novel. In the second edition, Walpole applied the word &#x27;Gothic&#x27; to the novel in the subtitle – A Gothic Story. Set in a haunted castle, the novel merged medievalism and terror in a style that has endured ever since. The aesthetic of the book has shaped modern-day Gothic books, films, art, music, and the Goth subculture.

Walpole was inspired to write the story after a nightmare he had at his Gothic Revival home, Strawberry Hill House, in Twickenham, southwest London. Claiming he saw a ghost in the nightmare—which featured a &quot;gigantic hand in armour&quot;—Walpole incorporated imagery from this into the novel, and also drew on his knowledge of medieval history.

The novel initiated a literary genre that would become extremely popular in the later 18th and early 19th century, with authors such as Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, William Thomas Beckford, Matthew Lewis, Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker, Edgar Allan Poe, Robert Louis Stevenson and George du Maurier.

==History==

&quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; was written in 1764 during Horace Walpole&#x27;s tenure as MP for King&#x27;s Lynn. Walpole was fascinated with medieval history, in 1749 building a fake gothic castle, Strawberry Hill House.

The initial edition was titled in full: &quot;The Castle of Otranto, A Story. Translated by William Marshal, Gent. From the Original Italian of Onuphrio Muralto, Canon of the Church of St. Nicholas at Otranto&quot;. This first edition purported to be a translation based on a manuscript written at Naples in 1529 and recently rediscovered in the library of &quot;an ancient Catholic family in the north of England&quot;. He employed an archaic style of writing to reinforce this conceit.

The Italian manuscript&#x27;s story, it was claimed, derived from a story still older, dating back perhaps as far as the Crusades. This Italian manuscript, along with alleged author &quot;Onuphrio Muralto&quot;, were Walpole&#x27;s fictional creations, and &quot;William Marshal&quot; his pseudonym.

In the second and subsequent editions, Walpole acknowledged authorship of the work, writing: &quot;The favourable manner in which this little piece has been received by the public, calls upon the author to explain the grounds on which he composed it&quot; as &quot;an attempt to blend the two kinds of romance, the ancient and the modern. In the former all was imagination and improbability: in the latter, nature is always intended to be, and sometimes has been, copied with success...&quot; There was some debate at the time about the function of literature; that is, whether works of fiction should be representative of life or more purely imaginative (i.e., natural vs. romantic). The first edition was well received by some reviewers who understood the novel as belonging to medieval fiction, &quot;between 1095, the era of the First Crusade, and 1243, the date of the last&quot;, as the first preface states; and some referred to Walpole as an &quot;ingenious translator&quot;. Following Walpole&#x27;s admission of authorship, however, many critics were loath to lavish much praise on the work and dismissed it as absurd, fluffy, romantic fiction, or even unsavory or immoral.

In his 1924 edition of &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, Montague Summers showed that the life story of Manfred of Sicily inspired some details of the plot. The real medieval castle of Otranto was among Manfred&#x27;s possessions. He repeated the assertion in 1938 in &quot;The Gothic Quest.&quot;

==Plot==
&quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; tells the story of Manfred, lord of the castle, and his family. The book begins on the wedding day of his sickly son Conrad and princess Isabella. Shortly before the wedding, however, Conrad is crushed to death by a gigantic helmet that falls on him from above. This inexplicable event is particularly ominous in light of an ancient prophecy, &quot;that the castle and lordship of Otranto should pass from the present family, whenever the real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it.&quot; Manfred, terrified that Conrad&#x27;s death signals the beginning of the end for his line, resolves to avert destruction by marrying Isabella himself while divorcing his current wife, Hippolita, who he feels has failed to bear him a proper heir in light of the sickly condition of Conrad before his untimely death.

However, as Manfred attempts to marry Isabella, she escapes to a church with the aid of a peasant named Theodore, who had correctly identified the giant helmet that had killed Conrad as having come from the giant statue standing before the church. Manfred accuses Theodore of having sorcerous responsibility for the helmet having been summoned. Manfred orders Theodore&#x27;s death while talking to the friar Jerome, who ensured Isabella&#x27;s safety at the church. When Theodore removes his shirt to be killed, Jerome recognizes a mark below his shoulder and identifies Theodore as his own son, and thus being of noble birth. Jerome, who has revealed himself to be of noble rank, begs for his son&#x27;s life, but Manfred says Jerome must either give up the princess or his son&#x27;s life. They are interrupted by a trumpet and the entrance of knights from another kingdom who want to deliver Isabella to her father, Frederic, along with the castle, as Frederic has a stronger claim to it (another reason Manfred wishes to wed Isabella). This leads the knights and Manfred to race to find Isabella.

Theodore, having been locked in a tower by Manfred, is freed by Manfred&#x27;s daughter, Matilda. He races to the underground church and finds Isabella. He hides her in a cave and blocks it to protect her from Manfred and ends up fighting one of the mysterious knights. Theodore badly injures the knight, who turns out to be Isabella&#x27;s father, Frederic. With that, they all go up to the castle to work things out. Frederic falls in love with Matilda, and he and Manfred make a deal to marry each other&#x27;s daughters. However, Frederic backs out after being warned by an apparition of a skeleton.

Manfred, suspecting that Isabella is meeting Theodore in a tryst in the church, takes a knife into the church, where Matilda is meeting Theodore. Thinking his own daughter is Isabella, he stabs her. Theodore is then revealed to be the true prince of Otranto as Matilda dies, leaving Manfred to repent. A giant ghostly form appears, declares the prophecy fulfilled, and shatters the castle walls.

Manfred abdicates the principality and retires to religion along with Hippolita. Theodore becomes prince of the remains of the castle and is married to Isabella, for she is the only one who can truly understand his sorrow.

==Characters==

* Manfredthe lord of the Castle of Otranto. He is the father of Conrad and Matilda, and the husband of Hippolita. After his son is killed by the falling helmet, he becomes obsessed with the idea of ending his marriage with Hippolita in pursuit of the much younger Isabella, who was supposed to marry his son. Manfred serves as the prime antagonist of the novel; he is the dictatorial ruler and father and drives the plot forward in a depiction of deranged cruelty visited upon his children.
* Hippolitathe wife of Manfred and the mother of Conrad and Matilda. After having lost her son, she is left with just Matilda to combat the tyrannical turn of mind that her husband displays. Manfred intends to divorce her due to her sterility and on the grounds that their marriage is in fact false because they are actually related. Faced with the threat of divorce, Hippolita is mournful yet submissive to the will of her husband. She acts as a sort of enabler to her husband, putting aside her morals and happiness so that her husband can get what he wants.
* Conradthe fifteen-year-old son of Manfred and Hippolita and the younger brother of Matilda. In the first pages of the novel, he is crushed by a giant helmet on his way to his wedding with Isabella.
* MatildaMatilda is the daughter of Hippolita and the oppressive Manfred. She falls in love with Theodore, much to her chagrin since it is a love unsanctioned by her parents. Upon the appearance of Frederic, things become even more complicated as Frederic lusts after Matilda. She serves as the forbidden woman, a facet of Gothic literature. Frederic and Manfred make plans to marry each other&#x27;s daughter, crushing Matilda&#x27;s hope of being with Theodore. At the end of the novel, she is mistakenly stabbed by her father.
* Isabellathe daughter of Frederic and the fiancée of Conrad (at the beginning of the novel). After the death of Conrad, she makes it clear that, although she did not love Conrad, she would have far preferred being betrothed to him than to his father, who pursues her throughout the novel. Isabella and Matilda have a brief argument concerning the fact they both have feelings for Theodore. After the death of Matilda, Theodore settles for Isabella and the two become the lord and lady of the castle.
* Theodoreat the beginning of the novel, Theodore appears to be a minor character, whose role is purely to point out the significance of the helmet as a link to the fulfillment of the prophecy. However, he emerges as a main character after Manfred orders him to be imprisoned within the helmet for his insolence, and he escapes and helps Isabella to escape from the castle through a trapdoor. He is revealed later in the novel to be the lost son of Friar Jerome. Theodore proceeds to protect Isabella from the wanton lust of Manfred. He captures the hearts of both Isabella and Matilda, but settles for Isabella after Matilda&#x27;s death. He also later goes on to rule the Castle of Otranto.
* Friar Jeromethe friar at the monastery near the Castle of Otranto. Manfred attempts to manipulate him into both supporting his plan to divorce his wife and persuading his wife to go along with this plan. It is later discovered that he is Theodore&#x27;s father.
* Fredericthe long-lost father of Isabella who appears late into the novel. He opposes Manfred at first, until he settles on a deal to marry Matilda.
* Biancathe servant of Matilda who serves as a comic relief of the otherwise highly melodramatic novel.
* Diego and Jaquezthese two, like Bianca, are other servants in the Castle of Otranto.

==Literary elements==
In the preface of the second edition, Walpole claims the novel is &quot;an attempt to blend the two kinds of romance, the ancient and the modern.&quot; He defines the &quot;ancient&quot; romance by its fantastic nature (&quot;its imagination and improbability&quot;) while defining the &quot;modern&quot; romance as more deeply rooted in literary realism (&quot;a strict adherence to common life,&quot; in his words). By combining fantastic situations (helmets falling from the sky, walking portraits, etc.) with supposedly real people acting in a &quot;natural&quot; manner, Walpole created a new and distinct style of literary fiction, which has frequently been cited as a template for all subsequent gothic novels. &quot;The Monthly Review&quot; stated that for &quot;[t]hose who can digest the absurdities of Gothic fiction&quot; &quot;Otranto&quot; offered &quot;considerable entertainment&quot;.

===Gothic elements===

The &quot;Castle of Otranto&quot; is the first supernatural English novel and is a singularly influential work of Gothic fiction. It blends elements of realist fiction with the supernatural and fantastical, establishing many of the plot devices and character types that would become typical of the Gothic novel: secret passages, clanging trapdoors, pictures beginning to move, and doors closing by themselves. The poet Thomas Gray told Walpole that the novel made &quot;some of us cry a little, and all in general afraid to go to bed o’nights.&quot;

===&quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; and Shakespeare===
The first and most obvious connection to William Shakespeare is presented by Horace Walpole himself, in the preface to the second edition of &quot;Otranto&quot;, in which he &quot;praises Shakespeare as a truly original genius and the exemplar of imaginative liberty, as a part of a defense of &quot;Otranto&quot;″s design&quot;. Elsewhere, Walpole&#x27;s several allusions to works by Shakespeare further emphasize the connection he wishes to draw between his own work and Shakespeare&#x27;s. For example, in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&#x27;s encounter with the Ghost becomes for Walpole a template for terror&quot;.

Walpole presents a &quot;more fragmented recasting&quot; of the Ghost in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which had served as a representation of the &quot;now unsanctioned, but still popular Catholic view of ghosts as speakers of truth&quot; for Shakespeare. The Catholic elements at play within both &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Otranto&quot; are invoked to represent a further sense of wonder and mystery to the Protestant audiences of both works. The Catholic element was a necessary facet of the &quot;template of terror&quot; that Walpole meant to invoke.

The allusion to Hamlet&#x27;s experience with the Ghost is meant not only as a &quot;template of terror,&quot; but also to make readers feel as if they are watching the play itself, and Walpole does this on three occasions. First, he posits Manfred&#x27;s encounter with the animated portrait of Ricardo as a connection to the Ghost&#x27;s initial appearance to Hamlet. Second, when Friar Jerome informs Theodore of the dangers to be found in Otranto and calls for him to take revenge, this is a direct allusion to the Ghost&#x27;s demand to Hamlet to remember him. Third, Frederic&#x27;s encounter with the skeletal apparition parallels the final appearance of the Ghost in &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

The violent question of bloodlines and succession serves as a key element in many of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, from &quot;Hamlet&quot; to &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and it is clearly one of the major concerns of &quot;Otranto&quot;. The link to &quot;Hamlet&quot; is strengthened even more because of the incest that is also at play in &quot;Otranto&quot;. &quot;In &quot;Otranto&quot;, the castle and its labyrinths become grounds for incest that signal the dissolution of familial bonds&quot;, which is also a major point of issue in &quot;Hamlet&quot; since Hamlet&#x27;s mother (Gertrude) and his uncle (Claudius) were, in a way, related before their marriage. Both &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Otranto&quot; are literary springboards for discussion of the questions of marriage, as the question of Henry VIII&#x27;s annulment of his marriage and later marriage to Anne Boleyn were still heated topics of controversy. Henry VIII had married his brother&#x27;s wife Catherine of Aragon and later dissolved that marriage due to Catherine&#x27;s inability to produce a male heir who lived to adulthood. Similarly, &quot;Otranto&quot; revolves around &quot;a larger sexual contest to secure lineage&quot;.

The final connection between &quot;Otranto&quot; and Shakespeare lies in the role that the servants play. Like Shakespeare, Walpole aims to create a &quot;mixture of comedy and tragedy,&quot; and one of the ways he does so is by using the minor, servant characters (such as Bianca) as comic relief. This is a trope that Walpole takes from Shakespeare as, for example, Shakespeare&#x27;s mechanicals from &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; also serve as the key comic element in the play.

=== Queer elements ===
Horace Walpole&#x27;s aesthetic productions, especially his home at Strawberry Hill House, have been interpreted through the lens of queer theory and described as camp. &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; is seen as establishing a literary foundation in which sexual desire and transgression is a defining thematic undercurrent of the new genre of the Gothic. Max Fincher has written that Manfred is preoccupied with the threat of his identity being discovered in a way that parallels the fear of homoerotic desire being discovered. He argues that misogyny in the novel is an attempt to project manliness, overcompensating for the author&#x27;s or character&#x27;s fears of queerness or weakness. Because of these fears, he argues, the book presents non-heteronormative behavior as &quot;unnatural and demonic.&quot;

==Impact and adaptations==

===Literary===
&quot;Otranto&quot; is generally credited with creating the entire Gothic novel genre. It was a smash hit in its day, until the author revealed that it was purely satirical fiction rather than an actual adaptation of medieval text. At that point, the critics and populace who had praised it turned on the book, claiming it was superficial, and other pejoratives generally assigned to romantic novels, which were seen as inferior in Britain at that time. But its impact was dramatic. The novelist Clara Reeve wrote &quot;The Old English Baron&quot; (1777) as a response, claiming she was taking Walpole&#x27;s plot and adapting it to the demands of the time by balancing fantastic elements with 18th-century realism. She explained:
After a number of other novels were added to the budding Gothic genre, the teenage author Matthew Lewis published &quot;The Monk&quot; (1796), a novel that directly imitated the formula of &quot;Otranto&quot;, but took it to such an extreme that some have interpreted the novel as parody.

===Film adaptations===
Jan Švankmajer directed the surrealist short film &quot;Castle of Otranto&quot; (1977) based on the novel. It takes the form of a pseudo-documentary frame story in live action with an abridged adaptation of the story itself presented in cut-out animation in the style of Gothic art.

<doc id="588741" wikidata="Q581952" url="?curid=588741" title="Space Oddity">
<text>&quot;Space Oddity&quot; is a song by the English singer-songwriter David Bowie. It was first released on 11 July 1969 by Philips and Mercury Records as a 7-inch single, then as the opening track of his second studio album, &quot;David Bowie&quot;. Produced by Gus Dudgeon and recorded at Trident Studios in London, it is a tale about a fictional astronaut named Major Tom; its title and subject matter were partly inspired by &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) and Bowie&#x27;s feelings of alienation at that point in his career. Its sound departed from the music hall of his debut album to psychedelic folk inspired by the Bee Gees; it was one of the most musically complex compositions he had written up to that point.

Rush-released as a single to capitalise on the Apollo 11 Moon landing, it received critical praise and was used by the BBC as background music during its coverage of the event. It initially sold poorly but soon reached number five in the UK, becoming Bowie&#x27;s first and only chart hit for another three years. Reissues by RCA Records became Bowie&#x27;s first US hit in 1972, and his first UK number-one in 1975. He re-recorded an acoustic version in 1979. Several promotional videos were produced for the song, including a 1972 one filmed by Mick Rock. It was a mainstay during Bowie&#x27;s concerts until 1990, after which it was played sporadically until 2002. Bowie revisited the Major Tom character in later singles, notably the sequel song &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (1980).

A range of artists have covered &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and others have released songs that reference Major Tom. A 2013 cover by the astronaut Chris Hadfield gained widespread attention; its music video was the first filmed in space. The song has appeared in numerous films and television series, including &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot; (2013). In 2019, Tony Visconti remixed Bowie&#x27;s original recording to mark its 50th anniversary, with a new music video directed by Tim Pope. In later decades, &quot;Space Oddity&quot; is considered one of Bowie&#x27;s finest recordings and remains one of his most popular songs. It has appeared in numerous &quot;best-of&quot; lists, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;.

==Background and writing==
Following a string of unsuccessful singles, David Bowie released his music hall-influenced self-titled debut studio album through Deram Records in 1967. The album was a commercial failure and did little to gain Bowie notice, leading to his departure from Deram in May 1968 and becoming his last release for two years. After its commercial failure, Bowie&#x27;s new manager Kenneth Pitt authorised the production of a promotional film in an attempt to introduce Bowie to a larger audience. The film, &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot;, went unreleased until 1984; it marked the end of Pitt&#x27;s mentorship of Bowie.

By the end of 1968, Bowie had begun to feel alienation from his career. Knowing &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot; did not have a guaranteed audience and would not feature any new material, Pitt asked Bowie to write something new to &quot;demonstrate David&#x27;s remarkable inventiveness&quot;. Bowie wrote &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, a tale about a fictional astronaut named Major Tom. Its title and subject matter were influenced by Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, which premiered in May 1968. Bowie said, &quot;I went stoned out of my mind to see the movie and it really freaked me out, especially the trip passage&quot;. Other events in Bowie&#x27;s life influenced the writing of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, including seeing the Apollo 8 &quot;Earthrise&quot; photograph in January 1969 and his break-up with the dancer Hermione Farthingale the following month. He later said, &quot;It was Hermione who got me writing for and on a specific person&quot;. The biographer Marc Spitz stated Bowie&#x27;s feelings of loneliness and heartache following the break-up inspired &quot;Space Oddity&quot;.

One of the first people to hear &quot;Space Oddity&quot; was Calvin Mark Lee, the head of A&amp;R at Mercury Records in London. Lee considered the song &quot;otherworldly&quot; and knew it was Bowie&#x27;s ticket to be signed by the label. The head of Mercury, Lou Reizner, was unimpressed with Bowie&#x27;s output and was unwilling to sign him. Eager to sign Bowie, Lee, without Reizner&#x27;s knowledge, financed a demo session for &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. Lee later told Spitz: &quot;We had to do it all behind Lou&#x27;s back. But it was such a good record.&quot;

==Composition==
===Lyrics===
&quot;Space Oddity&quot; tells the story of an astronaut named Major Tom, the first of Bowie&#x27;s famous characters. Major Tom is informed by Ground Control that a malfunction has occurred in his spacecraft; but the astronaut does not get the message. He remains in space &quot;sitting in a tin can, far above the world&quot;, preparing for his lonely death. In 1969, Bowie compared Major Tom&#x27;s fate to the ending of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, saying: &quot;At the end of the song Major Tom is completely emotionless and expresses no view at all about where he&#x27;s at. He&#x27;s fragmenting ... at the end of the song his mind is completely blown – he&#x27;s everything then.&quot; The authors David Buckley and Peter Doggett comment on the unusual vocabulary in the lyrics, such as &quot;Ground Control&quot; rather than &quot;Mission Control&quot;, &quot;space ship&quot; rather than &quot;rocket&quot;, &quot;engines on&quot; rather than &quot;ignition&quot;, and the &quot;unmilitary combination&quot; of rank and first name for the character.

Bowie&#x27;s biographers have provided different interpretations of the lyrics. According to Doggett, the lyrics authentically reflect Bowie&#x27;s mind and thoughts at the time. He writes that Bowie shone a light on the way advertisers and the media seek to own a stake in a lonely man in space while he himself is exiled from Earth. Chris O&#x27;Leary said the song is a &quot;moonshot-year prophecy&quot; that humans are not fit for space evolution and the sky is the limit. Similarly, James E. Perone views Major Tom acting as a &quot;literal character&quot; and a &quot;metaphor&quot; for individuals who are unaware of, or do not make an effort to learn, what the world is. In 2004, the American feminist critic Camille Paglia identified the lyrics as representing the counterculture of the 1960s, stating, &quot;As his psychedelic astronaut, Major Tom, floats helplessly into outer space, we sense that the &#x27;60s counterculture has transmuted into a hopelessness about political reform (&#x27;Planet Earth is blue / And there&#x27;s nothing I can do&#x27;)&quot;.

===Music===
&quot;Space Oddity&quot; has been characterised as a psychedelic folk and folk rock ballad. It represented Bowie&#x27;s new interest in acoustic music since joining the experimental trio Feathers. Nicholas Pegg and Doggett compare the song&#x27;s style, structure, lyrics and arrangement to those of the Bee Gees&#x27; 1967 single &quot;New York Mining Disaster 1941&quot;, which has similar minor chords and chorus. Hutchinson later stated: &quot;&#x27;Space Oddity&#x27; was a Bee Gees type song. David knew it, and he said so at the time ... the way he sang it, it&#x27;s a Bee Gees thing.&quot;

&quot;Space Oddity&quot; is one of the most complex songs Bowie had written up to that point. He storyboarded each section, all leading into the next until completion. According to O&#x27;Leary, in a little over five minutes, the song includes &quot;a faded-in intro, a 12-bar solo verse, a &#x27;liftoff&#x27; sequence, a duet verse, a bridge, a two-bar acoustic guitar break, a six-bar guitar solo, a third verse, another bridge, break and solo, and a &#x27;Day in the Life&#x27;-style outro to the fade&quot;. Bowie stated in 2002 he was &quot;keen on ... writing in such a way that it would lead me into leading some kind of rock musical&quot;.

Although primarily in the key of C major, the song has a variety of chord changes and resonances that aid in telling the story. The intro has a pairing of F major7/E and E minor, while the first verse alternates between C major and E minor. The guitar harmonises E and B while on Stylophone, Bowie &quot;drones&quot; C and B. A D major chord plays on the line &quot;God&#x27;s love be with you&quot; during the pre-liftoff countdown sequence. In the second verse, an E7 chord on the line &quot;really made the grade&quot; counteracts the overall key of C major. O&#x27;Leary said this change &quot;brightens&quot; the song. The bridge&#x27;s &quot;planet Earth is blue&quot; has a standard folk-style descending progression; (B major 9th/A minor add9/G major add9/F). According to O&#x27;Leary, the B major9 chord &quot;ratifies Major Tom&#x27;s choice (or doom) to stay out in space&quot;. The acoustic-guitar break has a C–F–G–A–A note sequence with the two A notes emphasised.

==Recording==
===Initial demos and first studio version===
One of the first demos of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, recorded in January 1969, differs greatly from the album version, including unused vocal harmonies and different lyrics. Rather than the softly spoken &quot;lift-off&quot;, an American-accented &quot;blast-off!&quot; is present. &quot;I&#x27;m floating in a most peculiar way&quot; is replaced with &quot;Can I please get back inside now, if I may?&quot; The demo also includes the later-revised lines:

The demo&#x27;s instrumentation uses only acoustic guitar and Stylophone, which were played by Hutchinson and Bowie, respectively. Bowie had used the Stylophone, a recently released electronic instrument that was mainly marketed to children, to compose the song&#x27;s melody. Both Bowie and Hutchinson sang vocals. They recorded further acoustic demos in March or April 1969.

The first full studio version of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, which was for &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot;, was recorded on 2 February 1969 at Morgan Studios, London. At this point, the lyrics were finalised. The session was produced by Jonathan Weston; Bowie and Hutchinson were joined by Colin Wood on Hammond organ, Mellotron and flute; Dave Clague on bass and Tat Meager on drums. As in the early demos, Bowie and Hutchinson shared lead vocals, with Bowie voicing Major Tom&#x27;s dialogue and Hutchinson singing Ground Control&#x27;s lines. Bowie also played an ocarina solo. Pegg calls this version significantly inferior to the &quot;David Bowie&quot; recording.

===Album version===
In June 1969, Pitt negotiated a one-album deal, with options for a further one or two albums, with Mercury Records and its UK subsidiary Philips. Mercury executives had heard one of the &quot;Space Oddity&quot; demos earlier in 1969. After Beatles&#x27; producer George Martin turned down the project, Pitt hired Tony Visconti, who produced Bowie&#x27;s later Deram sessions. &quot;Space Oddity&quot; had been selected as the lead single in advance. Visconti, however, saw it as a &quot;novelty record&quot; and &quot;a gimmick to cash in on the moonshot&quot;. He declined to produce the song, passing production responsibility to Bowie&#x27;s former engineer Gus Dudgeon; Visconti produced the rest of the album. On hearing Bowie&#x27;s demo, Dudgeon said it was &quot;unbelievable&quot;; he and Bowie planned &quot;every detail&quot; of the recording.

Work on the album version of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and its B-side, &quot;Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud&quot;, began at Trident Studios in London on 20 June 1969. Mercury insisted the single was released the following month, ahead of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. The guitarist Mick Wayne of the British band Junior&#x27;s Eyes and the keyboardist Rick Wakeman were brought on at Visconti&#x27;s suggestion, while the composer Paul Buckmaster was hired to arrange the orchestra, which consisted of eight violins, two violas, two cellos, two arco basses, two flutes and an organ. Buckmaster advised Bowie to focus on creating the overall sound rather than the narrative. Dudgeon hired the bassist Herbie Flowers and the drummer Terry Cox of the folk band Pentangle, while Bowie played acoustic guitar and Stylophone. Bowie later said he added the Stylophone at Marc Bolan&#x27;s suggestion; &quot;[Bolan] said, you like this kind of stuff, do something with it. And I put it on &#x27;Space Oddity&#x27;, so it served me well.&quot; Bowie fell ill with conjunctivitis and overdubs were completed a few days later.

Dudgeon outlined a plan for the Stylophone and Mellotron parts by scribbling notes on paper, later telling the biographer Paul Trynka: &quot;When we hit that studio we knew exactly what we wanted – no other sound would do.&quot; At one point, Wayne thought he had finished his guitar take early so he began retuning one of the strings. Dudgeon liked the warped effect of the retuning and asked Wayne to repeat it on the next take. Wakeman recorded his part in two takes after hearing the demo once; he later said; &quot;it was one of half a dozen occasions where it made the hair stand up on your neck and you know you&#x27;re involved in something special. &#x27;Space Oddity&#x27; was the first time it ever happened to me&quot;. Cox also felt a sense of excitement after the session finished.

The session cost £500. Dudgeon was paid £100 for his work on the two songs; in June 2002, he instigated a lawsuit against Bowie claiming he did not receive the agreed two per cent of royalties for &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. Dudgeon intended to sue for a settlement of £1 million; the suit, however, was halted after Dudgeon&#x27;s death in a car accident the following month. Dudgeon had told Buckley he felt &quot;Space Oddity&quot; was among the finest work of Bowie&#x27;s career.

===Mixing===
&quot;Space Oddity&quot; was mixed in both mono and stereo formats, a rarity for radio singles at the time. Wakeman later said it was Bowie&#x27;s idea to mix it in both formats: &quot;To the best of my knowledge nobody released stereo singles at that time, and they pointed that out to David ... and I can remember David saying, &#x27;That&#x27;s why this one will be stereo!&#x27; And he just stood his ground ... he wasn&#x27;t being awkward, but he had a vision of how things should be.&quot; The biographer Kevin Cann said stereo copies were given to the media and radio stations while mono copies were given to retailers. According to Pegg, the stereo single was sold only in specific territories, including Italy and the Netherlands; the mono single appeared in both Britain and America.

==Release and promotion==

&quot;Space Oddity&quot; was released as a single on 11 July 1969, with &quot;Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud&quot; as the B-side, by Philips in the UK and Mercury in the US. In some territories, the single&#x27;s sleeve included a photograph of Bowie playing an acoustic guitar, a rarity for singles at the time. The label rush-released the single to capitalise on the Apollo 11 Moon mission, which was launched five days later. According to Bowie: &quot;It was picked up by British television and used as the background music for the landing itself in Britain ... Though I&#x27;m sure they really weren&#x27;t listening to the lyric at all; it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant thing to juxtapose against a moon landing. Of course, I was overjoyed that they did.&quot; Upon realising the dark lyrics, the BBC ceased playing it until the Apollo 11 crew safely returned home.

Shortly after its release, &quot;Space Oddity&quot; received some glowing reviews. Penny Valentine of &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; predicted the record was &quot;going to knock back everyone senseless&quot;, and named &quot;Space Oddity&quot; the magazine&#x27;s record of the year. In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Chris Welch wrote: &quot;This Bee Geeian piece of music and poetry is beautifully written, sung and performed. Strangely, it could be a hit and escalate Bowie to the top.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said it&#x27;s &quot;a blastoff set to music, and it&#x27;s haunting and eerie and right on the dot.&quot; Despite the positive reviews and Pitt&#x27;s attempts at chart rigging, the single initially failed to sell. In September 1969, it debuted at number 48 on the UK Singles Chart. Mercury&#x27;s publicist Ron Oberman wrote a letter to American journalists describing &quot;Space Oddity&quot; as &quot;one of the greatest recordings I&#x27;ve ever heard. If this already controversial single gets the airplay, it&#x27;s going to be a huge hit&quot;. In the US, it peaked at 124 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Pitt attributed its poor performance to Oberman&#x27;s use of the word &quot;controversial&quot; in his statement, which caused it to be banned by US radio stations.

The single&#x27;s chart placement in the UK earned Bowie a number of television appearances in the latter half of 1969, starting with a performance on Dutch television show &quot;Doebidoe&quot; on 25 August 1969 (broadcast on 30 August). For his first appearance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on 2 October, Bowie was filmed in a separate studio so his image could be interspersed with NASA space footage. He played Stylophone and guitar over backing tracks prepared by Dudgeon, who was in charge of synchronising the BBC Orchestra to the backing track. Dudgeon said in 1991 that it was a &quot;nightmare&quot;, having only been given enough time for only two takes, the second of which had a tighter orchestra but sloppy cohesion between the space footage and Bowie. The performance, broadcast on 9 October, helped &quot;Space Oddity&quot; reach a new chart placement of number five by early November. Bowie gave additional performances on Germany&#x27;s &quot;4-3-2-1 Musik Für Junge Leute&quot; on 22 October (broadcast on 22 November) and Switzerland&#x27;s &quot;Hits A-Go-Go&quot; on 3 November. Bowie was named 1969&#x27;s Best Newcomer in a readers&#x27; poll for &quot;Music Now!&quot; On 10 May 1970, Bowie performed &quot;Space Oddity&quot; at the Ivor Novello Awards, where he was awarded with Most Original Song. 
Philips released &quot;David Bowie&quot; in the UK on 14 November 1969, with &quot;Space Oddity&quot; as the opening track. According to the biographer Christopher Sandford, despite the commercial success of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, the remainder of the album bears little resemblance to it, resulting in its commercial failure on its initial release, selling just over 5,000 copies by March 1970. In mid-December 1969, Philips requested a new version of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; with Italian lyrics after learning that one had already been recorded in Italy. Pitt thought the idea was &quot;ridiculous&quot; and said, &quot;it was explained to us that &#x27;Space Oddity&#x27; could not be translated into Italian in a way that the Italians could understand&quot;. The Italian version was recorded on 20 December at Morgan Studios with the accent coach and producer Claudio Fabi producing and lyrics translated by the Italian lyricist Mogol. This version, titled &quot;Ragazzo solo, ragazza sola&quot; (), was released as a single in Italy in 1970 and failed to chart.

Bowie did not have another hit after &quot;Space Oddity&quot; until the release of &quot;Starman&quot; in 1972. In his book &quot;The Complete David Bowie&quot;, Pegg opines that &quot;Space Oddity&quot; was destined to be remembered only as a novelty hit, as the year 1969 was full of similar tunes, from the Scaffold&#x27;s &quot;Lily the Pink&quot; to Rolf Harris&#x27;s &quot;Two Little Boys&quot;. Additionally, numerous space-themed songs had already charted by 1969, including Zager and Evans&#x27;s &quot;In the Year 2525&quot;, which was a UK number one in the three weeks immediately before &quot;Space Oddity&quot; entry into the top 40. Pegg argues that only later did Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;transcend&quot; the novelty hit to be regarded as a &quot;genuine classic&quot;.

===Rereleases===
Following the commercial breakthrough of Bowie&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; in 1972, Bowie&#x27;s then-label RCA Records undertook a reissue campaign for his Mercury albums that included repackaging &quot;David Bowie&quot; with the title &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. To promote this release, RCA rereleased &quot;Space Oddity&quot; as a single, with &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; as the B-side, on 13 December 1972 in North America only. The single reached number 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, becoming Bowie&#x27;s first hit single in the country. In Canada, it reached number 16 and was his third single on the charts there. &quot;Record World&quot; said of the reissued single that &quot;this disc is a winner from liftoff to fade&quot;. RCA again reissued the song in the UK on 26 September 1975 as a maxi single with two B-sides: 1971&#x27;s &quot;Changes&quot; and the then-unreleased 1972 outtake &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;. The UK reissue became Bowie&#x27;s first number-one single in the country in November.

In September 1979, Bowie re-recorded &quot;Space Oddity&quot; for the ITV New Year special &quot;Will Kenny Everett Ever Make It to 1980? Show&quot;. The idea came from the show&#x27;s director, David Mallet. Bowie recalled:

Visconti produced this new version, which solely featured acoustic guitar, bass, drums and piano. The new recording has a number of differences from the original; the liftoff sequence was replaced with 12 seconds of silence and a snare drum fade-out ends the song. O&#x27;Leary said while the original &quot;Space Oddity&quot; ends &quot;unresolved&quot;, the 1979 version leaves empty space. This version was issued on 15 February 1980 as the B-side of the single &quot;Alabama Song&quot;, which Visconti later said was &quot;never meant&quot; to occur. The 1979 recording was released in a remixed form in 1992 on the Rykodisc reissue of &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot;, and in 2017 on &quot;Re:Call 3&quot;, part of the compilation &quot;A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982)&quot;.

In July 2009, EMI issued the digital-only extended play (EP) &quot;Space Oddity 40th Anniversary EP&quot; to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the original single. The EP includes the original UK and US mono single edits, the 1979 re-recording and eight stem tracks that isolate the lead vocal, backing vocals, acoustic guitar, string, bass and drums, flute and cellos, Mellotron and Stylophone. These stem tracks are accompanied with a mobile app that allows users to create their own remixes. Pegg said the EP &quot;provid[es] a fascinating insight into the component sounds of a classic recording&quot;. In 2015, the original UK mono single edit was included on &quot;Re:Call 1&quot;, as part of the box set &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot;. The song&#x27;s 50th anniversary was marked on 12 July 2019 by the release of digital and vinyl singles of a new remix of the song by Tony Visconti. The vinyl version was issued in a box set that also includes the original UK mono single edit.

===Related releases===
Several demo versions of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; have been commercially released. Two early demos, including a fragment that may be the first-recorded demo of the song, were released for the first time in April 2019 on the box set &quot;Spying Through a Keyhole&quot;. Another early demo appeared on the 2009 two-CD special edition of &quot;David Bowie&quot; and was debuted on vinyl in May 2019 in the box set &quot;Clareville Grove Demos&quot;. An edited version of the March/April 1969 demo originally appeared as the opening track on the 1989 box set &quot;Sound + Vision&quot;. The unedited recording was released in June 2019 on the album &quot;The &#x27;Mercury&#x27; Demos&quot;. All the abovementioned demos and another previously unreleased one were compiled for the 5-CD box set &quot;Conversation Piece&quot;, which was released in November 2019. The February 1969 studio recording became commercially available in 1984 on a VHS release of the film &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot; and its accompanying soundtrack album. A shorter edit appeared on the 1997 compilation album &quot;The Deram Anthology 1966–1968&quot; and an alternative take was released for the first time on &quot;Conversation Piece&quot;.

==Live versions==
&quot;Space Oddity&quot; remained a concert staple and a live favourite throughout Bowie&#x27;s career. Bowie played the song for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Walker Lunchtime Show&quot; on 22 May 1972 but the recording was not broadcast; it was eventually released on the compilations &quot;BBC Sessions 1969–1972 (Sampler)&quot; (1996) and &quot;Bowie at the Beeb&quot; (2000). For the session, Bowie inserted &quot;I&#x27;m just a rocket man!&quot; between verses; Elton John had recently released &quot;Rocket Man&quot;, a song also about an astronaut and also produced by Gus Dudgeon.

A live rendition of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, recorded at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on 20 October 1972 during the Ziggy Stardust Tour, was first released on the bootleg &quot;Santa Monica &#x27;72&quot; (1994) before becoming officially available in 2008 on &quot;Live Santa Monica &#x27;72&quot;. Another performance, recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon, London, on 3 July 1973, was released on &quot;Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture&quot; (1983). During the 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour, Bowie sang &quot;Space Oddity&quot; while being raised and lowered above the stage by a cherry picker crane and used a radio microphone that was disguised as a telephone. A July 1974 performance of the song was released on the 2005 reissue of &quot;David Live&quot; while a September performance from the same tour was released in 2017 on &quot;Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles &#x27;74)&quot;.

A concert performance that was recorded on 12 September 1983 was included on the live album &quot;Serious Moonlight (Live &#x27;83)&quot;, released as part of the 2018 box set &quot;Loving the Alien (1983–1988)&quot; and separately the following year. The same performance appears on the concert video &quot;Serious Moonlight&quot; (1984). Bowie effectively retired the song from live performances during his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour, after which he sang it on a few occasions, most notably closing his 50th birthday party concert in January 1997 with a solo performance on acoustic guitar; this version was released on a limited edition CD-ROM that was issued with &quot;Variety&quot; magazine in March 1999. He then performed it at the Tibet House US benefit concert at Carnegie Hall in February 2002; this new version includes an orchestra conducted by Visconti, with string arrangements played by Scorchio and Kronos Quartet. Bowie&#x27;s final performance of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; was at Denmark&#x27;s Horsens Festival during the 2002 Heathen Tour.

==Music videos==
Multiple music videos for &quot;Space Oddity&quot; exist. The first, for the &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot; version of the song, was filmed at Clarence Studios from 6–7 February 1969. In it, Bowie plays both the tee-shirt-wearing Ground Control character and Major Tom, who wears a silver suit, a blue visor and a breast plate. RCA used this clip to promote the September 1975 UK single reissue.
To promote the December 1972 US reissue, a new promotional video was created at RCA&#x27;s New York studios by the photographer Mick Rock. In this video, Bowie mimes to the song with a guitar. Bowie later said:

I really hadn&#x27;t much clue why we were doing this, as I had moved on in my mind from the song, but I suppose the record company were re-releasing it again or something like that. Anyway, I know I was disinterested in the proceedings and it shows in my performance. Mick&#x27;s video is good, though.

Another video, for the 1979 version, debuted in the UK in December 1979 on the &quot;Will Kenny Everett Ever Make It to 1980? Show&quot;, and in the US on &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s Salute to the Seventies&quot;. A fourth video, directed by Tim Pope, was created for the 2019 remix of the song to promote the box set &quot;Conversation Piece&quot;. It combines footage from Bowie&#x27;s 50th birthday concert at Madison Square Garden with backdrop footage the choreographer Édouard Lock filmed for the 1990 Sound+Vision Tour. The video premiered at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and at Times Square in New York City on 20 July, and uploaded to YouTube hours later.

==Legacy==
===Major Tom===
Bowie continued the story of the Major Tom character in the single &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, from &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot; (1980). In the song, Major Tom is described as a &quot;junkie&quot; who is &quot;strung out in heaven&#x27;s high, hitting an all time low&quot; but Ground Control still believes he is doing as well as he was ten years prior. The song has been interpreted as Bowie&#x27;s confrontation of his past; after years of drug addiction in the 1970s, he used those struggles as a metaphor for Major Tom becoming a drug addict. The song&#x27;s music video reuses visual elements from the December 1979 television performance of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;.

Major Tom was revisited again in the 1996 Pet Shop Boys remix of the single &quot;Hallo Spaceboy&quot;, from &quot;Outside&quot; (1995). The idea for the song came from Pet Shop Boys member Neil Tennant, who informed Bowie he would be adding &quot;Space Oddity&quot;-related lines to the remix. Although Bowie was hesitant at first, he accepted. The lines in the remix read: &quot;Ground to Major, bye-bye Tom / Dead the circuit, countdown&#x27;s wrong&quot;.

Major Tom may have influenced the music video for Bowie&#x27;s 2015 single &quot;Blackstar&quot;, the title track from his final album &quot;Blackstar&quot; (2016). The video, a surreal, ten-minute short film directed by Johan Renck, depicts a woman with a tail (Elisa Lasowski), who discovers a dead astronaut and takes his jewel-encrusted skull to an ancient, otherworldly town. While the astronaut&#x27;s bones float towards a solar eclipse, a circle of women perform a ritual with the skull in the town&#x27;s centre. Renck initially refused to confirm or deny that the astronaut in the video is Major Tom but later said on a BBC documentary it was &quot;100% Major Tom&quot; to him.

===Retrospective acclaim===
&quot;Space Oddity&quot; remains one of Bowie&#x27;s most-popular songs and has frequently been listed by publications as one of his greatest. In 2015, &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine rated it Bowie&#x27;s 23rd-best track in a list of his 100 greatest songs. Following Bowie&#x27;s death in 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named &quot;Space Oddity&quot; one of the 30 most-essential songs of his catalogue. A year later, the staff of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; voted it Bowie&#x27;s tenth-best track. In 2017, &quot;NME&quot; readers voted &quot;Space Oddity&quot; Bowie&#x27;s seventh-best while the publication&#x27;s staff placed it at number 18 in a list of Bowie&#x27;s 40 best songs.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; Alexis Petridis voted &quot;Space Oddity&quot; number 25 in his list of Bowie&#x27;s 50 greatest songs, writing: &quot;Bowie perfectly inhabits its mood of blank-eyed, space-age alienation&quot;. In 2020, Tom Eames of Smooth Radio listed &quot;Space Oddity&quot; as Bowie&#x27;s fifth-greatest song. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; listed it as Bowie&#x27;s greatest song in 2016. Spencer Kaufman wrote: &quot;The song was revolutionary for its time, musically and lyrically, and helped introduce the masses to one of the most dynamic and creative music acts we will ever know.&quot; In a list ranking every Bowie single from worst to best, the publication placed &quot;Space Oddity&quot; at number four.

&quot;Space Oddity&quot; has appeared on numerous best-of lists. In a 2000 list compiling the 100 greatest rock songs, VH1 placed &quot;Space Oddity&quot; at number 60. In 2012, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; included it in their list of the 100 greatest top songs of all time, ranking it number 43. In lists ranking the greatest songs of the 1960s, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Space Oddity&quot; at number 20, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; at number 48, &quot;Paste&quot; at number three and &quot;Treble&quot; at number two. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;Space Oddity&quot; at number 189 in their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. The magazine stated that as Bowie&#x27;s first hit, it &quot;offer[ed] just a glimpse of the ever-evolving star he would become&quot;. Several publications, including &quot;Mojo&quot; (39), &quot;NME&quot; (67), and &quot;Sounds&quot; (41), have also listed &quot;Space Oddity&quot; as one of the greatest singles of all time. &quot;Channel 4&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; similarly ranked it the 27th-greatest British number-one single in 1997 while &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 26 in their 2012 list of the greatest number-one singles in history.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included &quot;Space Oddity&quot; in their list of &quot;The 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Cover versions and appearances in media==

&quot;Space Oddity&quot; has been covered by numerous artists, including Rick Wakeman and Terry Cox&#x27;s band Pentangle; both men were performers on the original recording. One of Bowie&#x27;s favourite versions was a recording by the Langley Schools Music Project, a 60-voice choir of Canadian children, recorded in the late 1970s and reissued on CD in 2002. Bowie said: &quot;The backing arrangement is astounding. Coupled with the earnest if lugubrious vocal performance, you have a piece of art that I couldn&#x27;t have conceived of, even with half of Colombia&#x27;s finest export products in me.&quot; Other artists have written songs that reference or develop the story of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;; these include Peter Schilling&#x27;s &quot;Major Tom (Coming Home)&quot; (1983), Def Leppard&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot; (1987), and Panic on the Titanic&#x27;s &quot;Major Tom&quot; (1993). In 1984, the English singer-songwriter Jonathan King released a mashup of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; together with Schilling&#x27;s &quot;Major Tom (Coming Home)&quot; titled &quot;Space Oddity / Major Tom (Coming Home)&quot;, which reached number 77 on the UK Singles Chart in May.

&quot;Space Oddity&quot; has been heard and referenced in numerous films and television series, including the American sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, the British series &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, and the films &quot;Mr. Deeds&quot; (2002), &quot;The Mother&quot; (2003) and &quot;C.R.A.Z.Y.&quot; (2005). The original single version is heard on the soundtrack of the 2004 film &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; and a 2015 episode of the American drama series &quot;Mad Men&quot;. It was also featured in a 2011 Renault Clio commercial and played on the radio of Elon Musk&#x27;s Tesla Roadster during its launch aboard the Falcon Heavy&#x27;s maiden flight in February 2018.
&quot;Space Oddity&quot; plays a pivotal role in the 2013 film &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;, in which Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is frequently referred to as &quot;Major Tom&quot; for daydreaming while at work. The song is featured in a scene in which Mitty decides to leap onto a helicopter after imagining his coworker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) singing the song. For the scene, Wiig&#x27;s vocal was mixed into Bowie&#x27;s original track. Stiller said about the importance of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; in the scene:

I felt like the way it fits into the story, we got to this point and this scene which was sort of how the fantasy and reality come together for Walter, and that was what that came out of. That song, and what he mentioned in his head, and what he imagines and what he does, it all just seemed to come together over that song.

&quot;Space Oddity&quot; was played throughout the opening montage for the 2017 film &quot;Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets&quot;, which showed humans making contact with extraterrestrial life. The director Luc Besson timed the sequences of the scene to the song&#x27;s guitar chords, which took many hours, and the bass riff was used to signify humanity&#x27;s first contact with aliens. The opening sequence had originally been storyboarded with the intention of &#x27;Space Oddity&#x27; being played in the background, with Besson saying &quot;It&#x27;s almost a music video; I matched the song to the image.&quot; Besson previously worked with Bowie on &quot;Arthur and the Invisibles&quot; (2006), and the singer agreed to allow Besson to use &quot;Space Oddity&quot; in &quot;Valerian&quot;, although Bowie died before the film was released.

===Chris Hadfield version===

In May 2013, the Canadian astronaut and artist Chris Hadfield, commander of Expedition 35 to the International Space Station (ISS), recorded a video of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; while stationed on the ISS that went viral and generated media coverage. It was the first music video to be recorded in space. In the video, filmed towards the end of Hadfield&#x27;s time on the ISS, Hadfield sang and played guitar while floating around the space station. On Earth, Joe Corcoran produced and mixed the backing track with a piano arrangement by the multi-instrumentalist Emm Gryner, who worked with Bowie during his 1999–2000 concert tours. Gryner said she was &quot;so proud to be a part of it&quot;.

The lyrics were somewhat altered; rather than losing communication with Ground Control and being lost in space as a result, Major Tom receives his orders to land and does so safely, reflecting Hadfield&#x27;s imminent return from his final mission to the ISS. The song also mentions the Soyuz spacecraft that Hadfield travelled in. Hadfield announced the video on his Twitter account: &quot;With deference to the genius of David Bowie, here&#x27;s Space Oddity, recorded on Station. A last glimpse of the World.&quot; Bowie&#x27;s social media team responded to the video, tweeting back to Hadfield, &quot;Hallo Spaceboy ...&quot;, and later called the cover &quot;possibly the most poignant version of the song ever created&quot;.

Hadfield&#x27;s performance was the subject of a piece by Glenn Fleishman in &quot;The Economist&quot; on 22 May 2013 analyzing the legal implications of publicly performing a copyrighted work of music while in Earth orbit. &quot;Space Oddity&quot; is the only song of Bowie&#x27;s for which he did not own the copyright; his publisher granted Hadfield a one-year licence to the song. When the one-year licence expired on 13 May 2014, the official video was taken offline despite Bowie&#x27;s explicit wishes for the publisher to grant Hadfield a licence at no charge to record the song and produce the video. Following negotiations, the video was restored to YouTube on 2 November 2014 with a two-year licence agreement. Pegg calls Hadfield&#x27;s video is &quot;Breathtakingly beautiful and extraordinarily moving, [and] offers a rare opportunity to deploy that overused adjective &#x27;awesome&#x27; with complete justification&quot;.

<doc id="588746" wikidata="Q55308" url="?curid=588746" title="Mullingar">
<text>Mullingar ( ; ) is the county town of County Westmeath in Ireland. It is the third most populous town in the Midland Region, with a population of 22,667 in the 2022 census.

The Counties of Meath and Westmeath Act 1543 proclaimed Westmeath a county, separating it from Meath. Mullingar became the administrative centre for County Westmeath. The town was originally named &quot;Maelblatha&quot;, and takes its modern name from a mill noted in the legend of Colman of Mullingar.

Traditionally a market town serving the large agricultural hinterland, Mullingar remains a significant commercial location. It had a tradition of cattle trading until 2003 when its cattle market was closed for the development of a mixed commercial and residential scheme called Market Point. However, in 2014 the local County Council allowed an annual Christmas Market to take place on Mount Street.

Mullingar has a number of neighbouring lakes, including Lough Owel, Lough Ennell and Lough Derravaragh. Lough Derravaragh is also known for its connection with the Irish legend of the Children of Lir. The town of Mullingar is linked to Lough Ennell via Lacy&#x27;s Canal and the River Brosna. Another nearby waterway is the Royal Canal, which loops around Mullingar.

== History ==

The Priory of St. Mary, or, the &#x27;House of God of Mullingar&#x27;, was swept away to make room for the additions and improvements in the new church now on its site. The &#x27;House of God&#x27; was erected by Ralph de Petyt, Bishop of Meath, in the year 1227, for regular canons of the order of St. Augustine.

== Local government and politics ==

Westmeath County Council is the local authority for Westmeath. The county council comprises two constituencies or &quot;municipal districts&quot;. Mullingar town is in the Mullingar Municipal District which comprises thirteen members.

The town is part of the Longford–Westmeath constituency for elections to Dáil Éireann.

There is a Chamber of Commerce in Mullingar, and Mullingar is one of the three towns that forms the Midlands Gateway region, along with Athlone and Tullamore, set up as part of the Government&#x27;s National Spatial Strategy 2002–2020.

== Tourism ==
Mullingar&#x27;s tourist attractions include its lakes – Lough Owel, Lough Derravaragh and Lough Ennell – which are visited by anglers. The Royal Canal also flows through the town. Belvedere House and Gardens, Mullingar Golf Club and the Bloomfield House Hotel are all located nearby. 

The town has a handful of hotels, including the Newbury Hotel, Annebrook House Hotel, Mullingar Park Hotel and the Greville Arms Hotel. The latter holds the two Brit awards presented to Niall Horan, and a large granite monument, which formerly stood at Dominick Street, which was presented to the town by Lord Greville.

One of Mullingar&#x27;s notable buildings is the cathedral of Christ the King Mullingar, the cathedral of the Diocese of Meath. The cathedral was dedicated on the day World War II broke out.

Columb Barracks, which closed in March 2012, was a military base that housed the 4th Field Artillery Regiment, the 4th Field Supply &amp; Transport Company and the HQ of the 54 Reserve Field Artillery Regiment (Army Reserve).
The 1916 Centenary Monument Green Bridge Mullingar was unveiled by Cllr Billy Collentine MCC on Easter Monday 2017. Mullingar Tidy Towns was the organisation that built this monument in memory of the 1916 Easter Rising.
Mullingar Town Park is a public park situated in the centre of the town, and it includes a wide variety of playgrounds, a swimming pool and a large pond near the centre. On 22 July 2016, the park became one of 22 public spaces in Ireland to be awarded a Green Flag.

== Economy ==
Among Mullingar&#x27;s exports are items of pewterware produced by Mullingar Pewter. Also associated with Mullingar is Genesis Fine Art, which produces gift items. The &quot;Pilgrims&quot; sculpture on Mullingar&#x27;s Austin Friars Street, at which location there once stood an Augustinian Friary, was crafted by Genesis on foot of a commission by the Mullingar chapter of Soroptimists International.

Mullingar&#x27;s commercial sector has expanded in recent years from just a few shops on the town&#x27;s main thoroughfares – Oliver Plunkett Street, Austin Friars Street, and Mount Street – to several major shopping areas. There is an out-of-town retail park at Lakepoint (about 1.6  km from the town centre), the Harbour Place Shopping Centre near the town centre, and a development at the Green – on the site of the former Avonmore and Penneys units.

The town has a mix of local retailers and chain stores, and branches of the major banks. The town also has a credit union, Mullingar Credit Union (formerly known as St. Colman&#x27;s House).

A proposed development, named &quot;Mullingar Central&quot;, was to have been located between Mount Street, the railway station and Blackhall Street. Planning permission was granted for retail, commercial and residential units. Phase 1, which included tax offices, library, civic offices and County Council buildings was officially opened on 11 June 2009. Phase 2, however, did not proceed.

Mullingar contains several industrial estates including Lough Sheever Corporate Park and Clonmore Industrial Estate and Mullingar Business Park. The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) also has a business park in Marlinstown. As of 2015, only one plot on the site has been acquired by an employer, Patterson Pumps, which is constructing a new plant to which it intends to move its entire Irish operation from its current location, at Mullingar Business Park. Two of the town&#x27;s manufacturing plants – Penn tennis balls and Tarkett – both closed in the early 2000s causing many job losses. Other local employers include the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar, P.E.M. Engineering, Trend Technologies, Taconic International, and Mullingar Pewter.

The town is home to a €25m Lidl warehouse and distribution centre.

Mullingar has a Chamber of Commerce which represents almost 200 businesses from varying commercial sectors.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===

Mullingar lies near the national primary route N4, the main Dublin – Sligo road, from the capital. The N52 also connects Mullingar to the Galway-Dublin M6 motorway at Athlone to the southwest, and Kells, Ardee and Dundalk to the northeast. The town is served by Bus Éireann services to Dublin, Athlone (where passengers can catch connecting buses), Sligo, Cavan, Tullamore and Ballina.

=== Waterway ===

In the 19th century the town was served for a time by the Royal Canal – however displaced first by the railway and then the car, it is no longer commercially used for the transport of goods or people. The town of Mullingar is also linked to Lough Ennell via Lacy&#x27;s Canal and the River Brosna.

=== Railways ===
The Midland Great Western Railway line to Mullingar from Dublin opened in stages from 1846 to 1848, arriving in Mullingar on 2 October 1848. This was to a temporary station, adjacent to the greyhound stadium. The original mainline ran from Dublin (Broadstone Station) to Galway via Mullingar, then via Moate to Athlone, the Mullingar to Galway section opening in August 1851. The present station opened with the branch line to Longford on 14 December 1855.

There were two secondary stations in Mullingar, the Canal Crossing cattle bank which was on the Sligo line and, on the Athlone line, Newbrook racecourse which had its own station. This was a two-platformed station with both platforms on the Down Line.

Currently, the Dublin-Sligo railway line northwest to Longford and Sligo is the mainline, Galway is accessed from Heuston Station via Portarlington and the line between Mullingar and Athlone is currently disused. Mullingar station is served by national rail company Iarnród Éireann&#x27;s &quot;Arrow&quot; commuter services to Dublin and &quot;InterCity&quot; trains to/from Sligo.

The Railway Preservation Society of Ireland have a secondary base in the town. There is a photo survey of the disused Athlone Line via Moate.

== Healthcare ==

The Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar serves the Longford-Westmeath area. An extension was built in the early 1990s. A change in government, however, halted investment and the extension lay as an empty shell until late 2006 when funding was finally secured to ensure its completion. There are several other hospitals in the town: St Loman&#x27;s, which provides psychiatric services to the Midlands; St Mary&#x27;s, a care centre for older people; and the St Francis Private Hospital.

== Education ==

The town has several primary schools, including a number run under the Catholic ethos, a Church of Ireland school, a non-denominational Educate Together primary school, and two Irish language primary schools. Local second-level schools include Coláiste Mhuire, the town&#x27;s oldest post-primary school, St Finian&#x27;s College, Loreto College Mullingar and Mullingar Community College.
Coláiste Mhuire is primarily a boys school, however, the repeat Leaving Certificate class is co-educational. Just to the north of Mullingar on the old Longford Road is St Finian&#x27;s College. Until 2003, St Finian&#x27;s was an all-boys boarding school; however, in 2003 the decision was made to phase out the boarding school by 2007, and to admit girls as well as boys. Loreto College for girls is the largest secondary school in the town, while Mullingar Community College is a co-educational school for boys and girls. The Community College also runs evening courses for adults and awards the FETAC certificates.

Wilson&#x27;s Hospital School, a co-educational boarding school, operates under the patronage of the Church of Ireland (Anglican Communion). It is located in the nearby village of Multyfarnham. It serves day students from the Mullingar area.

St. Joseph&#x27;s Secondary School, a co-educational school located in the nearby village of Rochfortbridge, also serves the Mullingar area.

Joyce&#x27;s father, John, was a civil servant posted from Dublin to compile an electoral register of Mullingar and the surrounding townlands. He often stayed in the Greville Arms Hotel. James referred to Mullingar in three of his novels, mentioning it twelve times in Ulysses, in chapter 14 of Stephen Hero, and three times in Finnegans Wake.

<text>The Diocese of Meath () is an Irish diocese which took its name after the ancient Kingdom of Meath. In the Roman Catholic Church it still exists as a separate diocese, but in the Church of Ireland it has been united with other dioceses.

==History==
Clonard Abbey was founded by Saint Finnian, first Abbot of Clonard, in the early sixth century. There had been a number monastic bishops at the abbey, but it was not until the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1111 that the diocese of Clonard was established. Its boundaries were set at the Synod of Kells in 1152, which covered roughly the western part of the Kingdom of Meath with the diocesan bishop&#x27;s seat (cathedra) located at Clonard Abbey. During the twelfth century the bishops of Clonard frequently used the title &quot;bishop of Meath&quot; or &quot;bishop of the men of Meath&quot; meaning the original centre of the Kingdom of Meath in Westmeath. Clonard acquired most of Magh Breagh (what is now the county of Meath) by absorbing the diocese of Duleek later in the twelfth century. After Bishop Simon Rochfort transferred his seat from Clonard to Trim in 1202, the title &quot;bishop of Meath&quot; became the normal style. The former seat of the diocese of Breifne or the Uí Briuin at Kells was absorbed into Meath in 1211, but that diocese remained extant among the Uí Briúin Bréifne, becoming the diocese of Kilmore. 

Following the Reformation, there are two parallel apostolic successions.

===Church of Ireland diocese===

In the Church of Ireland, the diocese of Meath united with Clonmacnoise in 1569, although only the single name of Meath to be continued. In 1976, the diocese of Meath was transferred from the Province of Armagh to Dublin. At the same time the diocese of Kildare was separated from Dublin and Glendalough and the new Diocese of Meath and Kildare was formed. The bishop has two seats: Trim Cathedral and Kildare Cathedral. The current Church of Ireland bishop is Pat Storey, Bishop of Meath and Kildare, who was elected in 2013.

===Roman Catholic diocese===

In the Roman Catholic Church, Meath is still a separate diocese. The Roman Catholic bishop&#x27;s seat is located at Christ the King Cathedral, Mullingar. The current bishop is Thomas Deenihan, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Meath, who succeeded to the title on 18 June 2018.

<text>Hal Russell (born Harold Russell Luttenbacher, August 28, 1926 – September 5, 1992) was an American free jazz composer, band leader and multi-instrumentalist who performed mainly on saxophone and drums but occasionally on trumpet or vibraphone. Russell&#x27;s fiery music was marked by significant humor, not unlike much of Dutch drummer Han Bennink&#x27;s output. His music was so accessible that &quot;People&quot; magazine hailed &quot;The Finnish Swiss Tour&quot; on ECM as one of its top 5 albums of the year. Russell set the table for the free improv and free jazz scene which exploded later in the 1990s in Chicago.

==Biography==
Born in Detroit, Michigan, United States, and raised in Chicago, Illinois, from the eighth grade, Russell began playing drums at age four, but majored in trumpet at college; he subsequently drummed in several big bands, including those of Woody Herman and Boyd Raeburn.

As with many young players in the mid-1940s, Russell&#x27;s life was irreversibly changed by bebop. In the 1950s he worked with musicians including Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, Sonny Rollins, John Coltrane, and Duke Ellington. He succumbed to drugs and was a heroin addict for ten years. In 1959, he joined the Joe Daley Trio, whose &quot;Newport&#x27; 1963&quot;, which was mostly studio material, was reputedly one of the earliest free jazz records.

In the early 1970s, Russell was the regular percussionist for the band at the suburban Chicago Candlelight Dinner Playhouse. Here he played mostly drums, but occasionally vibes and keyboards. At the same time he would host many young jazz musicians for jam sessions at his home, or in Chicago nightclubs.

In 1979, Russell formed the NRG Ensemble, which for most of its existence featured saxophonist Mars Williams, multi-instrumentalist Brian Sandstrom, and percussionist Steve Hunt, among others. At this time he starting playing tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone and trumpet, in addition to drums and vibes. Russell finally issued his first album in 1981 for the Nessa label. In the late 1980s, the group began playing frequently in Europe, and began recording for ECM with &quot;The Finnish/Swiss Tour&quot;. Russell led the NRG Ensemble until his death.

In addition to the NRG Ensemble, Russell always maintained several auxiliary bands, a partnership with pianist Joel Futterman, the rock-oriented trio NRG 3 with Ed Ludwig on drums and Noel Kupersmith on bass, and The Flying Luttenbachers with Chad Organ on tenor sax and Weasel Walter on drums.

Cited by some as a missing link between the AACM and later Chicago free jazz, Russell was experiencing greater public awareness before his death. Just after completing the semi-autobiographical album &quot;The Hal Russell Story&quot;, Russell died of a heart attack in September 1992.

<doc id="588762" wikidata="Q1562614" url="?curid=588762" title="Ross Barnes">
<text>Charles Roscoe Barnes (May 8, 1850 – February 5, 1915) was one of the stars of baseball&#x27;s National Association (1871–1875) and the early National League (1876–1881), playing second base and shortstop. He played for the dominant Boston Red Stockings teams of the early 1870s, along with Albert Spalding, Cal McVey, George Wright, Harry Wright, Jim O&#x27;Rourke, and Deacon White. Despite playing for these star-studded teams, many claim that Ross was the most valuable to his teams, he was also the first player in the MLB to ever score a Home run in 1876.

==Early life==
Ross Barnes was born on May 8, 1850, in Mount Morris, Livingston County, New York.

==Career==

From 1868 to 1870, Ross starred for the Rockford Forest Citys, along with Albert Spalding, attaining professional status in the second year. When the National Association was formed in 1871, Harry Wright signed both men to his new team in Boston. Barnes&#x27;s major league career thus started when he was 21. He split time between second base and shortstop for the Boston Red Stockings of the new National Association. Barnes led the league with 66 runs scored and 91 total bases, finishing second in batting average at .401.

In 1872, he led the Association with a .432 batting average, a .585 slugging percentage, 99 base hits, 134 total bases, and 28 doubles. The Red Stockings began a four-year dominance of the Association, with Barnes a key player each year. Barnes again led the Association in 1873, hitting .425, as well as leading in on-base percentage (.456), slugging percentage (.584), base hits (137), runs scored (125), total bases (188), doubles (29), bases on balls (28), and stolen bases (13). His .340 BA in 1874 was good enough for eighth in the league, while his .364 was good for second in 1875, while leading again in runs scored (115), base hits (143) and on-base percentage (.375).

His Red Stockings went a combined 205-50 from 1872 to 1875, a winning percentage not matched by any team since.

Before the 1875 season ended, Barnes and four other Boston players signed contracts with the Chicago White Stockings. When word leaked out in Boston before the end of the season, Barnes and his teammates were reviled by Boston fans, being called &quot;seceders,&quot; a strong epithet just a decade after the Civil War. It was likely that the National Association would void the signing, but Chicago owner William Hulbert preempted the move by forming the National League and causing the NA to disband.

Barnes&#x27;s new team finished first in the NL&#x27;s first season with a 55–12 record, while Boston fell to fourth. Ross led the National League batting (.429), on-base percentage (.462), slugging (.562), runs (126), hits (138), bases (190), doubles (21), triples (14), and walks (20). In the 1876 season, Barnes also established the single-season record for runs per game (1.91), a mark which still stands. Barnes also has the distinction of having hit the first home run in National League history, on May 2, 1876. In the 1876 season, Barnes not only lead the league in runs scored but had scored 54 more runs than any other player, the largest margin ever in the history of Major League Baseball.

===Fair-Foul Bunt Rule Change===
Barnes specialized in the fair-foul bunt. He was so dominant that the National League changed its rules after the 1876 season to eliminate it. At that time, home plate was made of cast iron, and was further forward than it is now and in fair territory. If a batted ball first landed in fair territory, it remained fair even if it rolled into foul territory immediately. And in the 1870s hitters were allowed to call for the pitch to be either high or low. Many hitters would call for the pitch to be low, and then bunt the ball so that it landed fair and rolled foul, in which case it would be impossible for the defense to throw them out. Barnes was the master at this, but differently than the other players he would take a full swing, aim for the top of the ball, so that it would bounce off home plate, and then roll way foul. And when the infielders would position themselves to field the bunt, Barnes would often swing away to keep them off balance. This technique allowed Barnes to be dominant, often hitting over .400, and lead the major leagues in ways that were unequaled. However, once the rule was changed, Barnes&#x27; offensive career collapsed and he never again hit even .300.

In 1877, Barnes fell ill with what was then only described as an &quot;ague,&quot; played only 22 games, and did not play well when he was in the lineup. The illness robbed Barnes of much of his strength and agility and shortened his career. Though some have blamed the rule change regarding foul balls for Barnes&#x27;s decline, Nate Silver argues that the illness was likely the primary factor that hurt Barnes&#x27;s career.

The remainder of his career was an effort to return to glory ending in mediocrity. He played for the Tecumseh team in the International Association (arguably baseball&#x27;s first minor league) in 1878, returned to the National League with the Cincinnati club in 1879, sat out all of 1880, and finished his professional career in 1881, playing his last season in Boston, the site of his former glory. After 1876, he never hit better than .272, and his other totals were barely half of those from his glory days. He retired at age 31. He finished his career with 859 hits, 698 runs, and a .359 average, in only 499 games played and 2392 at bats. His 1.4 runs per game played remains the best of all time.

Barnes briefly returned to professional baseball in 1890, serving as an umpire for the Players&#x27; League.

===Evaluation===

Barnes is only one of four players, the others being Babe Ruth, Rickey Henderson, and Aaron Judge, in the history of Major League Baseball to lead his league in runs scored with more than 30 runs over the next closest player; in 1876 Barnes had 54 more runs scored than runner-up George Wright, which is the largest differential ever.

Barnes holds the career NA records in runs (459), hits (530), doubles (99), walks (55), stolen bases (73), total bases (695), times on base (585), runs produced (694), batting average (.390), on-base percentage (.413), and slugging percentage (.511).

During the late 19th and early 20th century, Barnes was highly regarded by many baseball observers. In 1903, sportswriter Tim Murnane wrote that Barnes was the “king of second baseman, as well as the finest batsman and run-getter of all time.” However, the memory of Barnes&#x27;s accomplishments waned as the 20th century progressed, with many analysts, including Bill James, dismissing Barnes&#x27;s dominance due to his reliance on a defunct rule.

In the 21st century, Barnes has received some retroactive recognition by baseball writers. In 2007, Nate Silver wrote that Barnes was &quot;arguably the single most dominant player in Major League history.&quot;

==Personal life==

Barnes held a variety of white-collar jobs in the Chicago area after his baseball career, including serving as an accountant with People&#x27;s Gas, Light &amp; Coke Company. A bachelor for most of his life, Barnes married Ellen Welsh in 1900. He died from heart disease in 1915.

<text>&quot;Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US&quot; is a President&#x27;s Daily Brief prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency that was given to U.S. President George W. Bush on Monday, August 6, 2001. The brief warned, 36 days before the September 11 attacks, of terrorism threats from Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda, including &quot;patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for a hijacking&quot; of U.S. aircraft.

== President&#x27;s Daily Brief ==
The President&#x27;s Daily Brief (PDB) is a brief of important classified information on national security collected by various U.S. intelligence agencies given to the president and a select group of senior officials. On August 6, 2001, the Central Intelligence Agency delivered a President&#x27;s Daily Brief to President Bush, who was vacationing at his ranch in Crawford, Texas.

President Bush&#x27;s response of &quot;All right. You&#x27;ve covered your ass&quot; has been erroneously linked to this PDB. This response, however, came from a separate PDB linked to Bin Laden from several months earlier. During 2001, CIA analysts produced several reports warning of imminent attacks by Bin Laden and al-Qaeda. Senior officials, including Vice President Dick Cheney and staff from Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s office at the Department of Defense, questioned whether these reports might not be deception on the part of al-Qaeda, purposely designed to needlessly expend resources in response. After reevaluating the legitimate risks of these recent reports, CIA analysts produced a report titled &quot;UBL [Usama Bin Laden] Threats Are Real&quot;. It was after this report that the president gave that now-infamous response.

== Release ==
The content of the memo was kept secret, as with all but a handful of PDBs, until it was leaked in 2002. &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; reported on the document on May 15.

The PDB was declassified and approved for release to the 9/11 Commission on April 10, 2004, and was included in the commission&#x27;s &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, published on July 22, 2004. According to the National Security Archive, President Bush was the first sitting president to release a PDB to the public.

== Analysis ==
In response to accusations that the administration failed to act on the contents of the briefing, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and General Richard Myers emphasized that the CIA&#x27;s PDB did not warn the president of a specific new threat but &quot;contained historical information based on old reporting.&quot;

<doc id="588766" wikidata="Q888571" url="?curid=588766" title="Bobby Hutcherson">
<text>Robert Hutcherson (January 27, 1941 – August 15, 2016) was an American jazz vibraphone and marimba player. &quot;Little B&#x27;s Poem&quot;, from the 1966 Blue Note album &quot;Components&quot;, is one of his best-known compositions. Hutcherson influenced younger vibraphonists including Steve Nelson, Joe Locke, and Stefon Harris.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===

Bobby Hutcherson was born in Los Angeles, California, to Eli, a master mason, and Esther, a hairdresser. Hutcherson was exposed to jazz by his brother Teddy, who listened to Art Blakey records in the family home with his friend Dexter Gordon. His older sister Peggy was a singer in Gerald Wilson&#x27;s orchestra. Hutcherson went on to record on a number of Gerald Wilson&#x27;s Pacific Jazz recordings as well as play in his orchestra. Hutcherson&#x27;s sister personally introduced Hutcherson to Eric Dolphy (her boyfriend at the time) and Billy Mitchell. Hutcherson was inspired to take up the vibraphone when at about the age of 12 he heard Milt Jackson with Thelonious Monk, Percy Heath, Kenny Clarke and Miles Davis playing &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot; on the &quot;Miles Davis All Stars, Volume 2&quot; album (1954). Still in his teens, Hutcherson began his professional career in the late 1950s working with tenor saxophonist Curtis Amy and trumpeter Carmell Jones, as well as with Dolphy and tenor saxophonist Charles Lloyd at Pandora&#x27;s Box on the Sunset Strip.

He made his recording debut on August 3, 1960, cutting two songs for a 7-inch single with the Les McCann trio for Pacific Jazz (released in 1961), followed by the LP &quot;Groovin&#x27; Blue&quot; with the Curtis Amy-Frank Butler sextet on December 10 (also released by Pacific Jazz in 1961). In January 1962, Hutcherson joined the Billy Mitchell–Al Grey group for dates at The Jazz Workshop in San Francisco and Birdland in New York City (opposite Art Blakey). After touring with the Mitchell–Grey group for a year, Hutcherson settled in New York City (on 165th street in The Bronx) where he worked part-time as a taxi driver, before fully entering the jazz scene via his childhood friend, bassist Herbie Lewis.

===Blue Note Records===
Lewis was working with The Jazztet and hosted jam sessions at his apartment. After hearing Hutcherson play at one of Lewis&#x27; events, Jazztet and Jackie McLean band member Grachan Moncur III felt that Hutcherson would be a good fit for McLean&#x27;s group, which led to Hutcherson&#x27;s first recording for Blue Note Records on April 30, 1963, McLean&#x27;s &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;. This was quickly followed by sessions for Blue Note with Moncur, Dolphy, Gordon, Andrew Hill, Tony Williams and Grant Green in 1963 and 1964, later followed by sessions with Joe Henderson, John Patton, Duke Pearson and Lee Morgan. In spite of the numerous post-bop, avant-garde, and free jazz recordings made during this period, Hutcherson&#x27;s first session for Blue Note as leader, &quot;The Kicker&quot; (recorded in 1963 but not released until 1999), demonstrated his background in hard bop and the blues, as did &quot;Idle Moments&quot; with Grant Green.

Hutcherson won the &quot;Talent Deserving of Wider Recognition&quot; award in the 1964 &quot;Down Beat&quot; readers&#x27; poll, and Blue Note released Hutcherson&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot; in 1965. The 1966 record &quot;Stick-Up!&quot;, featuring Joe Henderson, Herbie Lewis, and Billy Higgins, was the first of many recorded sessions Hutcherson made with McCoy Tyner throughout their careers. &quot;Stick-Up!&quot; was also the only album out of ten Hutcherson recorded as leader for Blue Note between 1965 and 1969 which did not feature drummer Joe Chambers or any of Chambers&#x27; compositions. Spanning the years 1963 to 1977, Hutcherson had one of the longest recording careers with Blue Note, second only to Horace Silver&#x27;s.

===Return to the West Coast===
Hutcherson lost his cabaret card and taxi driver&#x27;s license in 1967 after he and Joe Chambers were arrested for marijuana possession in Central Park, so he moved back to California, but continued to record for Blue Note. This return to the West Coast resulted in an important partnership with Harold Land, with whom Hutcherson recorded seven albums for Blue Note, featuring a rotating lineup of pianists such as Chick Corea, Stanley Cowell, and Joe Sample, and usually Chambers on drums. The Hutcherson-Land group broke up in 1971, and that same year Hutcherson won the title of &quot;World&#x27;s Best Vibist&quot; in the International Jazz Critics Poll. After the release of &quot;Knucklebean&quot; in 1977, Hutcherson recorded three albums for Columbia Records in the late 1970s.
Land and Hutcherson reunited in the early 1980s for several recordings as the &quot;Timeless All Stars,&quot; a sextet featuring Curtis Fuller, Cedar Walton, Buster Williams, and Billy Higgins which recorded four albums for the Dutch label Timeless Records. After switching between several labels in the early 1980s for his solo material, Hutcherson recorded eight albums for Landmark Records from the 1980s into the early 1990s, and continued to work steadily as a sideman during this time. His recorded output slowed somewhat during the past few decades, although he did release albums for Atlantic and Verve in the 1990s, three for the Swiss-based label Kind of Blue in the 21st century, and continued to tour.

===Later years===
In 2004, Hutcherson became an inaugural member of the SFJAZZ Collective, featuring Joshua Redman, Miguel Zenón, Nicholas Payton, Renee Rosnes, and Eric Harland, among others. He toured with them for four years, and made an appearance at the SFJAZZ Center&#x27;s grand opening in 2013. His 2007 quartet included Renee Rosnes on piano, Dwayne Burno on bass and Al Foster on drums. His 2008 quartet included Joe Gilman on piano, Glenn Richman on bass and Eddie Marshall on drums. In 2010 he received the lifetime Jazz Master Fellowship Award from the National Endowment for the Arts and performed at Birdland in a quintet featuring Gilman, Burno, Marshall, and Peter Bernstein. 2014 saw Hutcherson return to Blue Note Records with &quot;Enjoy the View&quot;, recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood with Joey DeFrancesco, David Sanborn, and Billy Hart. The quartet performed four sold-out shows at the SFJAZZ Center in February, prior to the album&#x27;s release.

==Acting career==
Hutcherson&#x27;s intermittent acting career included an appearance as the bandleader in &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969), and as Ace in &quot;Round Midnight&quot; (1986).

==Personal life==
Hutcherson has a son, Barry, from his first marriage to Beth Buford. Hutcherson wrote the waltz &quot;Little B&#x27;s Poem&quot; for Barry in 1962. Due to the success of &quot;Ummh&quot; from the album &quot;San Francisco&quot;, one of Hutcherson&#x27;s few entries in the jazz fusion style, he was able to buy an acre of land on which he built a house in Montara, California, in 1972. That same year, he married Rosemary Zuniga, a ticket taker at the Both/And club in San Francisco. The couple had a son, Teddy, who is a production manager for SFJAZZ. Hutcherson attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church as a youth and converted to Catholicism later in life.

A heavy smoker all his life, Hutcherson had suffered from emphysema since 2007. He died from the condition in Montara, California, on August 15, 2016.

==Style and critical reception==


AllMusic contributor Steve Huey stated that Hutcherson&#x27;s &quot;free-ringing, open chords and harmonically advanced solos were an important part of Dolphy&#x27;s 1964 masterwork &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot;&quot;, and called &quot;Dialogue&quot; a &quot;classic of modernist post-bop&quot;, declaring Hutcherson &quot;one of jazz&#x27;s greatest vibraphonists&quot;. Huey went on to say: &quot;along with Gary Burton, the other seminal vibraphone talent of the &#x27;60s, Hutcherson helped modernize his instrument by redefining what could be done with it – sonically, technically, melodically, and emotionally. In the process, he became one of the defining (if underappreciated) voices in the so-called &quot;new thing&quot; portion of Blue Note&#x27;s glorious &#x27;60s roster.&quot;

In his liner notes to the 1980 release of &quot;Medina&quot;, record producer Richard Seidel (Verve, Sony Masterworks) wrote that &quot;of all the vibists to appear on the scene contemporaneous with Hutcherson, none have been able to combine the rhythmic dexterity, emotive attack and versatile musical interests that Bobby possesses.&quot; Seidel concurred that Hutcherson was &quot;part of the vanguard of the new jazz developments in the Sixties. He contributed mightily to several of the key sessions that document these developments.&quot;

Interviewed by Jesse Hamlin for a piece on Hutcherson in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 2012, collaborator Joshua Redman said that &quot;We talk a lot about how music expresses universal values, experiences and feelings. But you don&#x27;t often witness that so clearly and so profoundly as you do with Bobby. His music expresses the joy of living. He connects to the source of what music is about.&quot;

In an April 2013 profile for &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine, Dan Ouellette wrote that &quot;Hutcherson took the vibes to a new level of jazz sophistication with his harmonic inventions and his blurring-fast, four-mallet runs... Today, he&#x27;s the standard bearer of the instrument and has a plenitude of emulators to prove it.&quot; Ouellette quoted Joey DeFrancesco as saying &quot;Bobby is the greatest vibes player of all time... Milt Jackson was &quot;the&quot; guy, but Bobby took it to the next level. It&#x27;s like Milt was Charlie Parker, and Bobby was John Coltrane.&quot;

<text>Roy Ayers (born September 10, 1940) is an American vibraphonist, record producer and composer. Ayers began his career as a post-bop jazz artist, releasing several albums with Atlantic Records, before his tenure at Polydor Records beginning in the 1970s, during which he helped pioneer jazz-funk. He is a key figure in the acid jazz movement, and has been described as &quot;The Godfather of Neo Soul&quot;. He is best known for his compositions &quot;Everybody Loves the Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Lifeline&quot;, and &quot;No Stranger To Love&quot; and others that charted in the 1970s. At one time Ayers was listed among the performers whose music was most often sampled by rappers.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ayers was born on September 10, 1940, in Los Angeles. He grew up in a musical family, where his father played trombone and his mother played piano. At the age of five, he was given his first pair of vibraphone mallets by Lionel Hampton. The area of Los Angeles that Ayers grew up in, South Park (later known as South Central) was at the center of the Southern California Black music scene. He attended Thomas Jefferson High School that formed a formative part of the Central Avenue jazz scene. During high school, Ayers sang in the church choir and fronted a band named The Latin Lyrics, in which he played steel guitar and piano. His high school, Thomas Jefferson High School, produced various talented musicians, such as Dexter Gordon. Ayers has three children.

===Career===
Ayers started recording as a bebop sideman in 1962. In 1963, he released his first album &quot;West Coast Vibes&quot; featuring a collaboration with the saxophonist Curtis Amy. He rose to prominence when he dropped out of Los Angeles City College, and joined jazz flautist Herbie Mann in 1966.

In the early 1970s, Roy Ayers started his own band called Roy Ayers Ubiquity, a name he chose because ubiquity means a state of being everywhere at the same time.

Ayers was responsible for the highly regarded soundtrack to Jack Hill&#x27;s 1973 blaxploitation film &quot;Coffy&quot;, which starred Pam Grier. He played Elgin in &quot;Idaho Transfer&quot; the same year. He later moved from a jazz-funk sound to R&amp;B, as seen on &quot;Mystic Voyage&quot;, which featured the songs &quot;Evolution&quot; and the underground disco hit &quot;Brother Green (The Disco King)&quot;, as well as the title track from his 1976 album &quot;Everybody Loves the Sunshine&quot;.

In 1977, Ayers produced an album by the group RAMP, &quot;Come into Knowledge&quot;. That fall, he had his biggest hit with &quot;Running Away&quot;.

In late 1979, Ayers scored his only top ten single on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Disco/Dance chart with &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop The Feeling&quot;, which was also the leadoff single from his 1980 album &quot;No Stranger to Love&quot;, whose title track was sampled in Jill Scott&#x27;s 2001 song &quot;Watching Me&quot; from her debut album &quot;Who Is Jill Scott?&quot;

In the late 1970s, Ayers toured Nigeria for six weeks with Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, one of Africa&#x27;s most recognizable musicians. In 1980, Phonodisk released &quot;Music of Many Colors&quot; in Nigeria, featuring one side led by Ayers&#x27; group and the other led by Africa &#x27;70.

In 1981, Ayers produced an album with the singer Sylvia Striplin, &quot;Give Me Your Love&quot; (Uno Melodic Records, 1981). That same year, he also produced a second album called &quot;Africa, Center of the World&quot; on Polydor Records along with James Bedford and Ayers&#x27;s bass player William Henry Allen. Allen can be heard talking to his daughter on the track &quot;Intro/The River Niger&quot;. The album was recorded at the Sigma Sound Studios, New York.

In 1984 he released the LP &quot;In The Dark&quot; recorded with Columbia Records and produced by bassist Stanley Clarke. The LP produced the 12&quot; single release called &quot;Love is in the feel&quot; which, along with other tracks on the album, promoted the use of a LinnDrum an instrument which gained enormous popularity amongst pop and jazz funk musicians from 1982 to 1985. At this time Ayers&#x27; music was promoted extensively by the UK BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Robbie Vincent.

Ayers performed a solo on John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez&#x27;s production of Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Love Will Save The Day&quot; from her second multi-Platinum studio album &quot;Whitney&quot;. The single was released in July 1988 by Arista Records.

Ayers has played his live act for millions of people across the globe, including Japan, Australia, England and other parts of Europe.

Ayers is known for helping to popularize feel-good music in the 1970s, stating that &quot;I like that happy feeling all of the time, so that ingredient is still there. I try to generate that because it&#x27;s the natural way I am&quot;. This is continually reflected throughout his musical output, whether it be funk, salsa, jazz, rock, soul and rap.

===1990s to present===

In 1992, Ayers released two albums, &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;Wake Up&quot;, for the hip-hop label Ichiban Records. and also collaborated with Rick James for an album and is quoted to have been a very close friend of his.

In 1993, Ayers appeared on the record &quot;Guru&#x27;s Jazzmatazz Vol. 1&quot;, playing vibraphone on the song &quot;Take a Look (At Yourself)&quot;. The following year he appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time Magazine&quot;.

During the 2000s and 2010s, Ayers ventured into house music, collaborating with such stalwarts of the genre as Masters at Work and Kerri Chandler.

Ayers started two record labels, Uno Melodic and Gold Mink Records. The first released several LPs, including Sylvia Striplin&#x27;s, while the second folded after a few singles.

In 2004, Ayers put out a collection of unreleased recordings called &quot;Virgin Ubiquity: Unreleased recordings 1976–1981&quot; which allowed fans to hear cuts that didn&#x27;t make it onto the classic Polydor albums from his more popular years.

He has also worked in collaborations with soul singer Erykah Badu and other artists on his 2004 album &quot;Mahogany Vibes&quot;.

Ayers hosts the fictitious radio station &quot;Fusion FM&quot; in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; (2008).

In 2015, he appeared on Tyler, The Creator&#x27;s album &quot;Cherry Bomb&quot; on the track &quot;Find Your Wings&quot;.

=== Personal life ===
Ayers married his wife Argerie in the early 1970s and together they have three children. He also has a son, the writer Nabil Ayers, from an earlier relationship. His daughter Ayana has also been managing him recently.

===Awards and influence===
A documentary, &quot;The Roy Ayers Project,&quot; featuring Ayers and a number of artists who have sampled his music and have been influenced by him and his music, has been in development for a number of years. The Roy Ayers Project has been rebranded as &quot;Roy Ayers Connection&quot;, which highlights Roy Ayers and all the people and things that he is connected to.

Pharrell Williams cites Roy Ayers as one of his key musical heroes.

Ayers is a recipient of the Congress of Racial Equality Lifetime Achievement Award.

<text>Karl Hans Berger (March 30, 1935 – April 9, 2023) was a German-American jazz pianist, vibraphonist, composer, and educator. He was a leading figure in jazz improvisation from the 1960s when he settled in the United States for life. He founded the educational Creative Music Studio in Woodstock, New York, in 1972 with his wife and Ornette Coleman, to encourage international students to pursue their own ideas about music.

==Life and career==
Berger was born on March 30, 1935, in Heidelberg. He started playing classical piano when he was ten and worked in his early twenties at a club in his hometown. He learned modern jazz from visiting American musicians, such as Don Ellis and Leo Wright. During the 1960s, he started playing vibraphone. He studied musicology and sociology at the Free University of Berlin, achieving a doctoral degree in 1963 with a dissertation on music in Sowjet ideology. He worked as a member of Don Cherry&#x27;s band in Paris. When the band went to New York City to record &quot;Symphony for Improvisers&quot;, he recorded his debut album as a leader.

Berger worked with drummers Ed Blackwell and Jack DeJohnette, bassist Dave Holland, and saxophonists Ornette Coleman, Lee Konitz and Ivo Perelman. He worked further with Michael Bisio, Anthony Braxton and Baba Olatunji, as well as with Carla Bley, Bill Laswell John McLaughlin and Roswell Rudd, and with the Mingus Epitaph Orchestra, As musical arranger and conductor, he contributed to albums by Better Than Ezra, Buckethead, Jeff Buckley, Angélique Kidjo, Natalie Merchant and Rich Robinson, among others.

With Coleman and Ingrid Sertso, Berger&#x27;s wife, he founded the Creative Music Studio (CMS) in Woodstock, New York, in 1972, to encourage students to pursue their own ideas about music. Berger considered Coleman his friend and mentor, and like Coleman he was drawn to avant-garde jazz, free jazz, and free improvisation. The focus of CMS was &quot;teaching improvising musicians to develop their own aesthetics, and to draw and mesh ideas from across genres, traditions, and international borders&quot;. Among the teachers were John Cage, Steve Lacy, George Russell and Richard Teitelbaum. They closed the facility in 1984, but held masterclasses internationally, called World Jazz. Berger and Sertso founded Sertso Recording Studio in Woodstock in 2004.

Berger also taught at the New School, and at the Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts from 1994 to 2003. He then led the department of music of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth to 2005. He and his wife revived CMS in 2013, and retired in 2017. He remained active in music for the rest of his life, releasing his final album in the fall of 2022.

Berger died at a hospital in Albany, New York, on April 9, 2023, at age 88, from complications after surgery.

<text>Gary Burton (born January 23, 1943) is an American jazz vibraphonist, composer, and educator. Burton developed a pianistic style of four-mallet technique as an alternative to the prevailing two-mallet technique. This approach caused him to be heralded as an innovator, and his sound and technique are widely imitated. He is also known for pioneering fusion jazz and popularizing the duet format in jazz, as well as being a major figure in music education from his 30 years teaching at the Berklee College of Music.

==Biography==
Burton was born in Anderson, Indiana, United States. Beginning music at six years old, he mostly taught himself to play marimba and vibraphone. He began studying piano at age sixteen while finishing high school at Princeton Community High School in Princeton, Indiana (1956–60). He has cited jazz pianist Bill Evans as the inspiration for his approach to the vibraphone.

Burton attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1960–61 and the Stan Kenton Clinic at Indiana University in 1960. He studied with Herb Pomeroy and soon befriended composer and arranger Michael Gibbs. After establishing his career during the 1960s, he returned to join the staff of Berklee from 1971 to 2004, serving first as professor, then dean, and executive vice president, during his last decade at the college. In 1989, Burton received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee.

Early in his career, at the behest of Nashville saxophonist Boots Randolph, Burton moved to Nashville, Tennessee and recorded with several musicians from the area, including guitarist Hank Garland, pianist Floyd Cramer and guitarist Chet Atkins.

Burton toured the U.S. and Japan with pianist George Shearing. Shearing asked Burton to write a whole album of compositions for him which were released as &quot;Out of the Woods&quot; in 1965. Burton described the album in his autobiography, &quot;Learning to Listen&quot;, as his &quot;most ambitious effort at composing and arranging&quot;. Burton played with saxophonist Stan Getz from 1964 to 1966. It was during this time that he appeared with the band in the movie &quot;Get Yourself a College Girl&quot;, playing &quot;Girl from Ipanema&quot; with Astrud Gilberto. In 1967, he formed the Gary Burton Quartet with guitarist Larry Coryell, drummer Roy Haynes, and bassist Steve Swallow. Predating the jazz-rock fusion craze of the 1970s, the group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Duster&quot;, combined jazz, country, and rock. However, some of Burton&#x27;s previous albums (notably &quot;Tennessee Firebird&quot; and &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, both from 1966) had already shown his inclination toward such experimentation. After Coryell left the quartet in the late 1960s, Burton worked with guitarists Jerry Hahn, David Pritchard, Mick Goodrick, Pat Metheny, John Scofield, Wolfgang Muthspiel, Kurt Rosenwinkel, and Julian Lage.

Burton was named &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine&#x27;s Jazzman of the Year in 1968 (the youngest to receive that title) and won his first Grammy Award in 1972. The following year Burton began a forty-year collaboration with pianist Chick Corea, recognized for popularizing the format of jazz duet performance. Their eight albums won Grammy Awards in 1979, 1981, 1997, 1999, 2009, and 2013.

Burton has played with a wide variety of jazz musicians, including Gato Barbieri, Carla Bley, Chick Corea, Peter Erskine, Stan Getz, Hank Garland, Stephane Grappelli, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett, B. B. King, Steve Lacy, Pat Metheny, Makoto Ozone, Tiger Okoshi, Astor Piazzolla, Tommy Smith, Ralph Towner, and Eberhard Weber.

Burton is known for his variation of traditional four-mallet grip which has come to be known as &quot;Burton grip&quot;, and is popular among jazz vibraphonists, as well as some concert marimbists, including Pius Cheung and Evelyn Glennie.

From 2004 to 2008, Burton hosted a weekly jazz radio show on Sirius Satellite Radio. In 2011, he released his first album for Mack Avenue Records, entitled &quot;Common Ground&quot;, featuring the New Gary Burton Quartet (with Julian Lage, Scott Colley, and Antonio Sanchez). In 2013, the group released &quot;Guided Tour&quot;, their second recording for Mack Avenue Records. Burton&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Learning to Listen&quot;, was published by Berklee Press in August 2013 and was voted &quot;Jazz Book of the Year&quot; by the Jazz Journalists Association.

Burton retired from performing in March 2017 following a farewell tour with pianist and longtime collaborator Makoto Ozone.

==Personal life==
Burton is openly gay. He was in a homosexual relationship by the 1980s, and he came out publicly in a 1994 radio interview with Terry Gross. In 2013, he married Jonathan Chong in Provincetown, Massachusetts. Burton&#x27;s current partner is Dustin Le.

<text>Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 212 (VMFA-212) was a United States Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornet squadron. Most recently known as the &quot;Lancers&quot;, the squadron was last based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan and fell under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 12 (MAG-12) and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (1st MAW). VMFA-212 has an extensive combat history having participated in combat operations during World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and Operation Enduring Freedom. Due to a re-organization within Marine aviation, the squadron was deactivated in 2008.

==History==

===World War II===


Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 212 was activated as Marine Fighting Squadron 212 (VMF-212), the &quot;Hell Hounds&quot;, at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa, Hawaii on 1 March 1942. Deploying in May to the South Pacific in their Grumman F4F Wildcats, the squadron was stationed at Tontouta on the island of New Caledonia, and later moved up to the Quoin Hill Airfield on the island of Efate. As preparations for the invasion of Guadalcanal increased, the squadron operated a detachment at Turtle Bay Airfield on Espiritu Santo until the arrival of VMO-251 ensured that the island was provided with adequate aerial defense. During the early part of the Guadalcanal campaign, VMF-212 sent detachments to operate with Cactus Air Force squadrons deployed to Henderson Field until the entire squadron was committed to the battle in mid-October.

On June 27, 1942, a Wildcat of the squadron attacked a Royal Australian Air Force Catalina flying boat of No. 11 Squadron, having mistaken it for a Japanese aircraft. This led to the RAAF removing the red dot from the center of its roundel for the duration of the war in the Pacific in order to prevent confusion with the all-red &quot;hinomaru&quot; used as a roundel by Japanese aircraft.

The squadron acquired an enviable record by destroying 64½ enemy planes including that of Toshio Ohta, a Japanese ace. Of this number, LtCol Harold &quot;Indian Joe&quot; Bauer, the squadron&#x27;s first Commanding Officer, was credited with 11 kills and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his valor.

The squadron returned to the United States in November 1942 and remained on the West Coast until June 1943 when they sailed for Midway Atoll. The squadron remained on Midway for two months and then returned to Espiritu Santo. By August 1943, VMF-212 was back in the Solomon Islands where they participated in the campaigns to retake Vella Lavella and Bougainville. From 20 October through 27 November 1943 the squadron was based out of Barakoma Airfield and supported operations in the Treasury Islands, Choiseul and Bougainville. By December 1943 they moved to Torokina Airfield and remained there until they moved again on 20 January 1944 this time to Piva Airfield. Another move came on 20 March when they transited to Green Island and later back to Vella Lavella. VMF-212 remained in the vicinity of the Solomons and Bismarck Islands for the remainder of 1944 running fighter sweeps against the Japanese garrison on Rabaul and providing close air support for ground forces on Bougainville. On 8 January 1945, VMF-212 landed on Samar and provided close air support for United States Army troops during the campaign to retake the Philippines. During this time they flew over Mindoro, Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. It was also during this time that the squadron was a part of one of the worst aviation accidents of the war. At 09:40 on 24 January 1945, while taking off, 1Lt Karl Oerth of VMF-222 hit a lump in the runway, blew a tire and his Corsair careened wildly into his own squadron&#x27;s revetment area, which was shared with VMF-212. It completely wiped out the tents housing the intelligence, oxygen, parachutes and materiel departments. Many men attempted to rescue the pilot but while they were making this brave effort the plane exploded and set off all its .50 cal ammunition. 14 men were killed and over 50 wounded during this incident. In June 1945 the squadron arrived at Okinawa on the and conducted operations from there until the end of the war. During the duration of World War II, VMF-212 was credited with shooting down 132½ enemy aircraft A Corsair which came to grief on Approach to Quoin Hill Airfield on Efate, Vanuatu is now a great dive attraction.

===Korean War===

VMF-212, with no nickname since its reactivation in 1946, was one of the first squadrons sent to Far East at the outbreak of the war. They remained in Japan until Marines were able to capture Kimpo Airfield after the Battle of Inchon. The squadron finally touched down in Korea on 18 September 1950 and were flying their first Corsair F4U-5 strikes by 20 September. The squadron was later moved to Wonson, North Korea late October 1951 than onto Yonpo Airfield in North Korea as the United Nations&#x27; forces continued their advance in the early winter of 1950. The squadron adopted the name &quot;Devil Cats&quot; and a new patch was designed by Roy Irwin, depicting a Devil Cat clutching a Two-Step serpent in its mouth on a red shield. After the Chinese counterattack in late November 1950, VMF-212 aircraft flew almost continuous close air support missions supporting the 1st Marine Division as they fought their way out of encirclement during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir while being stationed afloat aboard the . The squadron operated from the USS &quot;Bataan&quot; until 5 March 1951.

VMF-212 moved to being land based at K3 Pohang, South Korea. A Grumman F9F Panther BuNo 123520 belonging to VMF-212 was destroyed by fire from other aircraft at K-3 in Korea July 30, 1951. The squadron left Korea in the spring or summer of 1951 and returned to Cherry Point NC. Those personnel who had extended enlistments transferred to VMF 214 at another Korean base. VMA-212&#x27;s F4U Corsairs were replaced by upgraded AU-1 Corsairs in 1952. The AU-1 Corsair had armor plate around the cockpit and the oil coolers that were moved up to behind the engine. The squadron dropped more ordnance during the Korean War than any other Marine Corps squadron. The AU-1 Corsair had an additional center bomb rack which carried a bomb until the rough Marston Matting, which was laid over the old pock-marked Japanese landing strip at K-6, caused the center bomb rack to break off. The AU-1 Corsair could carry a bomb on its center rack, two bombs on the wing root bomb racks and bombs on its wing racks. It struggled up to enemy territory at approximately . After releasing its bombs, the AU-l again became a fast fighter in close support of the front lines and a fighter capable of up to in a dive. Colonel Robert Galer, a Marine Corps Ace from World War II, was the Commanding Officer of MAG-12 in 1952, when he was shot down behind enemy lines and protected by VMF-212 pilots until rescued by a Marine Corps helicopter. VMF-212 lost ten pilots in Korea. On 9 June 1952, VMF-212 was re-designated VMA-212.

=== The 1950s and 1960s ===
After the cease fire in Korea, VMA-212 traded their AU-1 Corsairs for Douglas AD-2 and AD-3 Skyraiders. They boarded the USS Wasp in 1954, and joined MAG-13 at MCAS Kaneohe Bay, HI. They began a slow transition to white-and-gray paint schemes for their planes and sported a colorful flightline as the &quot;blue birds&quot; were phased out. The Devil Cats set a record for flight hours in May 1956, when their complement of fifty pilots kept its Skyraiders aloft for 4,276.2 hours for that month. The squadron accepted the WD tail code in August and transitioned to the jet age in March, 1958, with the North American FJ-4B Fury. The Devil Cats responded to the Quemoy-Matsu Crisis by prosecuting Operation Cannonball, in October 1958. VMA-212 and the Black Sheep of VMA-214 flew their aircraft across the Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, utilizing their air-to-air refueling capability. This marked the first time that a single-seat aircraft had ever done so, and it stood in the record books until it was eclipsed by VMF(AW)-451 in 1961, when the Warlords flew their F8U Crusaders from El Toro to Japan. The Devil Cats traded their Fury jets for the Douglas A4D-2 Skyhawks (redesignated A-4B) in August 1961. The squadron received the Vought F-8B Crusader in July 1963 and changed their name to Lancers. Ed Rutty, the Executive Officer, derived that name in keeping with the medieval theme of the Crusader. David and Mary Lerps designed the Lancer insignia that was used for decades, featuring crossed lances over a cross-emblazened shield. The squadron was redesignated a Marine Fighter Squadron, VMF-212. The squadron operated the day-fighter version of the Crusader for exactly one year, when they accepted the F-8D Crusader and were redesignated Marine (All Weather) Fighter Squadron, VMF(AW)-212 on July 1, 1964.

=== The Vietnam War &amp; the 1980s ===

The squadron was informed, in the Fall of 1964, that it would embark aboard the for its 1965 WestPac cruise. The squadron immediately began carrier qualifications to sharpen their skills. Armed conflict in Vietnam was looming as a reality at the time and the squadron upgraded to the ground-attack version of the Crusader, the F-8E. They arrived at NAS San Diego in January and practiced air-to-ground ordnance delivery with their new Crusaders. Carrier Air Group 16 (CVW-16) they arrived off the coast of Vietnam and began operating from Yankee Station. From 8 May to 6 December 1965 the Lancers flew missions against targets in North and South Vietnam. The Operations Officer, Major Harry E. Sexton, devised a way to carry 2,000-pound MK-84 bombs from an F-8 Crusader prior to being launched from an aircraft carrier. Commander, Air Group (CAG) of CVW-16 Commander James Stockdale&#x27;s A-4E Skyhawk was shot down September 9, over North Vietnam making the commanding officer of VMF(AW)-212 the acting CAG until a replacement arrived. This made 212&#x27;s Commanding Officer LtCol Chuck Ludden the first Marine Officer to command a carrier airwing since William A. Millington did in World War II. Captain Harlan P. Chapman was shot down on November 5, over North Vietnam. He became a POW until he was released in February, 1973. Of interest, this incident was referred to in the motion picture, Top Gun as the date that the main character, Pete Mitchell&#x27;s father was shot down. Later in the movie, Top Gun commander, Viper admits, &quot;I flew with your old man. VF-51. The Oriskany.&quot; In December 1965 the squadron returned to Hawaii having flown 3,018 combat hours and 1,588 sorties during their time off the coast of Vietnam. 

The squadron returned to MCAS Kaneohe Bay and resumed training with the F-8D. The unit reverted to the day-fighter version of the Crusader, the F-8B in early 1968 and lost its (all-weather) designation in March. VMF-212 received its first four McDonnell F-4J Phantom IIs in May 1968, but without the AWG-10 Pulse Doppler radar. Production of the radar was behind schedule for the production of the F-4J. The squadron was redesignated Marine Fixed/Wing Fighter Attack squadron, VMFA on August 10. The unit finally received radar-equipped birds in November 1969.

In April 1972, the squadron deployed from Hawaii to Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam in an effort to blunt the massive North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam. LtCol Richard Revie led the Lancers across the Pacific joining VMFA-115 and VMFA-232 at Danang. The squadron began sorties immediately, attacking ground targets in the south. Danang Air Base was attacked by rockets two days after 212&#x27;s arrival and two Lancers were injured on the flight line. Captain John W. Consolvo and his RIO, CWO3 James J. Castonguay were hit on May 7, after pulling off target near the northern Quang Tri Province. Consolvo fought to control the flaming Phantom but to no avail. He told his RIO to eject and Castonguay did. He did not see whether or not his pilot ejected. Castonguay hid from enemy patrols for nineteen hours before being rescued by helicopter. John Consolvo was listed as Missing In Action. The Lancers lost another Phantom and its crew on June 4, when Captain Benjamin Lee Tebault and 1LT Mike Konow were hit while diving on a target. The jet flew into the ground. The Marine Phantom units of Danang were ordered to Nam Phong, Thailand, but VMFA-212 was replaced by VMA(AW)-533 and the Lancers returned to Hawaii. VMFA-212 flew more than 1000 combat sorties during the two+ months they operated from Danang. VMFA-212 earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for its effort in Vietnam.

From 1974 until 1987, VMFA-212 deployed numerous times to Japan and the West Coast earning the CNO Aviation Safety Award, the Robert M. Hanson Award, and the Meritorious Unit Commendation. During October 1988, VMFA-212 completed its seventh and final rotation in the UDP as an F-4 Phantom squadron. With the last F-4 sorties flown in August 1988, over 23,000 accident-free hours had been accumulated since the loss of an aircraft on March 27, 1978 at Midway Island. The F/A-18C Hornet was received at this time.

=== The Gulf War &amp; the 1990s ===
In December 1990, the squadron deployed to Bahrain in support of Operation Desert Shield. From there, they flew air interdiction and close air support missions in support of coalition forces during Operation Desert Storm after 17 January 1991. On 13 August 1996 the Lancers took off for the final time from NAS Miramar en route to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. After a successful six-month cycle the Lancers became a permanent resident of MCAS Iwakuni.

===The Global War on Terror===

The Lancers were the second Marine Corps squadron to deploy after the September 11 attacks, following their aerial refueler aircraft from VMGR-152, the &quot;Sumos.&quot; The squadron left MCAS Iwakuni on 14 September and after being refueled over Iwo Jima, began flying Combat Air Patrols over Guam in support of Operation Noble Eagle.

In the spring of 2002 the squadron deployed to Kuwait. For the first time single seat C models and 2-seat Ds from VMFA (AW)-332 &quot;The Moonlighters&quot; were combined into one unit. The Moon-Lancers flew missions over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch and Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The OEF missions were, on average, 10 hours in duration and mostly at night.

Due to a re-organization within Marine aviation, the squadron was decommissioned in 2008 in order to facilitate the Corps&#x27; transition to the F-35.

==Squadron aces==

The following members of VMF-212 were credited with shooting down at least five Japanese aircraft and earned the right to be called an Ace. The numbers after their name represents the number of enemy aircraft they were credited with shooting down.


==MIA information==
In May 2008, a team from the &quot;Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command&quot; found the wreckage of an F4U Corsair (BuNo 55908) and the remains of 1stLt Allan S. Harrison III in the vicinity of Warangoi, Papua New Guinea. 1stLt Harrison was shot down by a Japanese aircraft on 11 February 1944 while taking part in a raid on the Japanese garrison at Rabaul.

<text>Concordia Seminary is a Lutheran seminary in Clayton, Missouri. The institution&#x27;s primary mission is to train pastors, deaconesses, missionaries, chaplains, and church leaders for the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS). Founded in 1839, the seminary initially resided in Perry County, Missouri. In 1849, it was moved to St. Louis, and in 1926, the current campus was built.

The St. Louis institution was at one time considered the &quot;theoretical&quot; (academic) seminary of the LCMS while Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne was considered the &quot;practical&quot; seminary, although those distinctions no longer exist. Concordia Seminary currently offers a Master of Divinity degree leading to ordination, as well as Master of Arts, Master of Sacred Theology, Doctor of Ministry, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. The seminary is considered theologically conservative. It does not train women for ordination as pastors. However, it does offer a program by which women may be rostered as deaconesses (a category of &quot;ministers of religion&quot; within the LCMS). It promotes historical-grammatical interpretation of the Bible. It is an accredited member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.

Radio station KFUO-AM had its studios on the seminary campus until they were relocated to the LCMS International Center in the St. Louis suburb of Kirkwood, MO although the station continues to use a transmitter tower on the campus. For many years the nationally broadcast &quot;Lutheran Hour&quot; originated from this LCMS radio station.

Dedicated on November 15, 1992, the Chapel of St. Timothy and St. Titus serves as the house of worship for the Concordia Seminary community. Aside from the primary worship space the chapel building also contains a choir practice room, one classroom, the dean of chapel&#x27;s office, the housefellow&#x27;s quarters, and a chapel that is used primarily for small worship services and for worship practice.

==Library==
Concordia Seminary Library has the capacity to house 250,000 volumes and to seat over 300 people, providing study space for divinity students and carrels for graduate students and scholars. The book collection numbers over 245,000 volumes. Included are the personal libraries of many of the founding fathers of the LCMS and its theologians, including C. F. W. Walther. A copy of the 17th-century &quot;Calov Bible&quot; that was owned by Johann Sebastian Bach is also in the collection.

==Luther statue==

Located next to Founder&#x27;s Hall, the Luther Statue was originally dedicated at the former site of Concordia Seminary on Jefferson Avenue in St. Louis in 1903. In 1926, when the present campus was dedicated in Clayton, the statue was relocated to the new campus site. The statue is an exact replica the one in the Luther Monument in Worms, Germany. The statue in Germany is located where Martin Luther made his &quot;Here I Stand&quot; speech at the Diet of Worms.

==Luther Tower==

Luther Tower was designed by architect Charles Klauder and was completed in 1966. It stands tall. At its base is a small chapel, the Chapel of the Holy Apostles. Its crown contains a 49-bell carillon. The bells are dedicated to the memory of all LCMS pastors. The largest bell weighs and the smallest weighs .

==Concordia Historical Institute==
The Concordia Historical Institute is the Department of Archives and History of the LCMS. The institute is located at 804 Seminary Place on the Concordia Seminary campus. The building includes a reference room for patrons, a conference room, a museum exhibit space, and three stack areas for storage of the collections.

The institute maintains the Saxon Lutheran Memorial and the Peace Lutheran Church historic sites in Perry County, Missouri. It also publishes the &quot;Concordia Historical Institute Quarterly&quot;, and assists districts and congregations of the LCMS to preserve their historical records.

==Concordia Park==
Concordia Park is located in the DeMun neighborhood on the grounds of Concordia Seminary. The city of Clayton has leased this passive park from the seminary since 1992. It consists of several hills and trees. Benches and tables are provided for visitors. It was named a Best Picnic Spot by the &quot;Riverfront Times&quot; in 2008.

==Athletics==
Concordia has varsity basketball and tennis teams, but the teams are not affiliated with any league. It also offers club sports including golf and soccer. Known as the Fighting Preachers, the basketball team schedules games with other independents as well as with some NCAA Division III teams. There is a longstanding rivalry with the other LCMS seminary, Concordia Theological Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana; Concordia had won every game in that rivalry for 24 years ().

The basketball team plays in the Eldon E. Pederson Fieldhouse. The fieldhouse originally was an airplane hangar on an airbase in Kansas. In 1949 the seminary purchased it, disassembled it, and re-erected it on the campus. At one time it served as the practice court of the NBA&#x27;s St. Louis Hawks and as the home court for the ABA&#x27;s Spirits of St. Louis.

==Seminex controversy==

Concordia Seminary became a focus of national media attention in 1974, when 45 of its 50 faculty members, together with the vast majority of students, walked out of campus to form a rival institution known as Seminex, or Concordia Seminary in Exile. The procession protested the suspension of the seminary&#x27;s president, John Tietjen, who faced charges from the conservative Synodical president, Jacob Preus, of allowing the teaching of false doctrine. More specifically, the charges alleged that Tietjen had permitted the teaching of historical-critical methods of scriptural interpretation, rather than upon exegetical principles that consider scripture to be the inerrant word of God (see Biblical inerrancy). During this same period, in 1975, Concordia was added to a list of censured institutions by the American Association of University Professors.

Seminex struggled due in part to the LCMS preventing it from placing graduates in ministerial positions within the LCMS. It suffered a gradually declining enrollment over the course of the late 1970s, with the last St. Louis commencement being held in May 1983. It continued to exist as an educational institution at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago campus through the end of 1987. Seminex contributed to a major schism in the LCMS.

<doc id="588807" wikidata="Q169902" url="?curid=588807" title="Prince Aimone, Duke of Aosta">
<text>Prince Aimone, 4th Duke of Aosta (&quot;Aimone Roberto Margherita Maria Giuseppe Torino&quot;; 9 March 1900 – 29 January 1948), was a prince of Italy&#x27;s reigning House of Savoy and an officer of the Royal Italian Navy. The second son of Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Aosta, he was granted the title Duke of Spoleto on 22 September 1904. He inherited the title Duke of Aosta on 3 March 1942 following the death of his brother Prince Amedeo in a British prisoner of war camp in Nairobi.

From 18 May 1941 to 31 July 1943, Aimone was designated king of the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH), even though he never ruled there. He formally accepted the position and took the name Tomislav II, after the first Croatian king. Later, however, he refused to assume the kingship in protest of the Italian annexation of the Dalmatia region, and is therefore referred to in some sources as king designate. Regardless, many sources refer to him as King Tomislav II and the nominal head of the NDH during its first two years (1941–1943). 
After the dismissal of Mussolini on 25 July 1943, Aimone abdicated on 31 July as king on the orders of Victor Emmanuel III.

==Early life==
Prince Aimone Roberto Margherita Maria Giuseppe Torino of Savoy-Aosta was born in Turin the second son of Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Aosta (eldest son of Prince Amedeo, 1st Duke of Aosta (and sometime &quot;King Amadeo I of Spain&quot;) by his wife, &quot;née&quot; Vittoria dal Pozzo, Principessa della Cisterna) and Princess Hélène of Orléans (daughter of Philippe, comte de Paris, and Princess Marie Isabelle of Orléans). As his patrilinal great-grandfather was King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, he was a member of the House of Savoy.

With his brother Amedeo, he was educated at St David&#x27;s College, Reigate, Surrey, England, and Aimone later went to study at the naval academy in Livorno. On 1 April 1921, Prince Aimone became a member of the Italian Senate. Princes of the House of Savoy became members of the Senate at age 21, obtaining the right to vote at age 25.

In 1929, twenty years after his uncle Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi had attempted to climb K2 in Karakoram, Prince Aimone led an expedition to Karakorum. A member of the expedition was Ardito Desio. Due to the failure to climb K2 twenty years earlier, Prince Aimone&#x27;s expedition concentrated solely on scientific work. He was afterwards awarded the 1932 Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Patron&#x27;s Medal for his work.

==Marriage and issue==
After being romantically linked with Infanta Beatriz of Spain, the daughter of King Alfonso XIII, he married, on 1 July 1939 at the church of Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence, Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark, daughter of King Constantine I and Princess Sophie of Prussia. They had one son, Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, born in 1943.

==War years==

===Croatian throne===
On 18 May 1941, in a ceremony at the Quirinal Palace, to which Ante Pavelić, the leader of the fascistic Ustaše movement that had assumed power in Croatia in April 1941 after the invasion of Yugoslavia, led a delegation of Croats requesting that Italy&#x27;s King Victor Emmanuel III name a member of the House of Savoy as king of Croatia. The Independent State of Croatia was a fascist puppet state that was partly under Italian and German control, covering most of present-day states of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but its leaders tried to assert their legitimacy by instating a monarchy that would resemble the medieval Croatian state.

Aimone was then officially named king by his cousin Victor Emmanuel III. On assuming the Crown of Zvonimir he took the regnal name Tomislav II. Originally on learning that he had been named king of Croatia, he told close colleagues that he thought his nomination was a bad joke by his cousin King Victor Emmanuel III, though he accepted the crown out of a sense of duty. The Italian Foreign Minister and Benito Mussolini&#x27;s son in law, and Count Ciano&#x27;s informants said of Aimone &quot;The Duke doesn&#x27;t give a damn about Croatia and wants only money, money and more money.&quot; Ciano&#x27;s diary noted a conversation between Aimone and himself, where Aimone was &quot;proud of having been chosen King of Croatia, but has no exact idea of what he is supposed to do and is vaguely uneasy about it&quot;.

He was due to be crowned in Duvno (Tomislavgrad), in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, but he refused to go to there due to the &quot;Dalmatian question&quot; which arose due to Italy taking some of Dalmatia&#x27;s coastal territory. Aimone felt that Dalmatia &quot;was a land that could never be Italianized&quot; and was an obstacle to Italo-Croatian reconciliation. Other reasons why he never went to Croatia were because of an ongoing insurgency, and that his safety could not be guaranteed. Because of this he exercised what little power he had from Italy and Hungary, however he never held any real authority throughout his reign as the Ustaše government had deprived the monarchy of most powers and reduced the status of the king to that of a figurehead. Count Gyula Cseszneky was the counsellor to the king for Croatian affairs. Prince Aimone also established a Croatian office in Rome where he received confidential reports, official documents, and military, political and economic information from Croatia.

After the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, Aimone abdicated as king of Croatia on 31 July 1943 on the orders of Victor Emmanuel III.

Prince Aimone succeeded to the title duke of Aosta on 3 March 1942, following the death of his elder brother Prince Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta, in a British prisoner of war camp in Kenya.

In the autumn of 1942, Aimone contacted Allied forces via his courier, the consul general Alessandro Marieni, about the possibility of a peace settlement between Italy and Allied forces. Secret talks would continue into 1943, motivated in part by the aim of preserving the royal dynasty of Savoy.

===Aftermath===

In the latter months of World War II, he became the commander of the Italian Naval Base of Taranto but he was dismissed from his post for his criticism of the judges that had found General Mario Roatta guilty of war crimes. During his naval career he reached the rank of Squadron Admiral.

==Death==
In 1947, following the birth of the Italian Republic the previous year, Prince Aimone left Italy for South America. Just a year after his arrival, he suddenly died on 29 January 1948 in his temporary residence, a private suite at the Alvear Palace Hotel in the French Borough of Recoleta in Buenos Aires, while his entourage was arranging his permanent residency documents and the purchase of his new home in Argentina. The claim to the Aosta ducal title passed to his son Prince Amedeo.

<text>The NFL draft is an annual sports draft in which National Football League (NFL) teams select newly eligible players for their rosters. To be eligible for the NFL draft, a player must be at least three years removed from high school. While the regulations do not explicitly require collegiate attendance, players must either exhaust their college eligibility or seek a special exemption from the league. Each NFL franchise seeks to add new players through the draft as it is the league&#x27;s most common source of player recruitment. Each team is assigned a position in the drafting order based on the reverse of its record from the previous year. The team with the worst record selects first, followed by the team with the second-worst record, and so forth. Teams also have the option to trade with another team to move up to a better draft position. Teams that did not make the playoffs are ordered by their regular-season record, with any remaining ties broken by strength of schedule. Playoff participants are sequenced after non-playoff teams, based on their round of elimination (wild card, division, conference, and Super Bowl).

From through , the first selection in the NFL Draft was awarded by a random draw known as the &quot;bonus pick.&quot; The team that received the bonus pick forfeited its selection in the final round of the draft, and once a team won, it was excluded from future draws. By the 1958 draft, all twelve league teams had received a bonus pick, leading to the system’s abolition. Following this, the NFL faced competition from the American Football League (AFL), which held a separate draft prior to the merger agreements in 1966. This rivalry resulted in both leagues often drafting the same players, sparking bidding wars for top prospects. As part of the merger agreement on June 8, 1966, the two leagues adopted a unified &quot;common draft&quot; system. After the AFL-NFL merger was finalized in 1970, the common draft became the modern NFL Draft.

Through the 2024 NFL draft, 89 players have been selected first overall, with the first being Jay Berwanger and the most recent being Caleb Williams. The Indianapolis Colts and the Los Angeles Rams have each made the most first overall selections in history with seven, while the Baltimore Ravens (the franchise had the first pick in 1954 when they were the Cleveland Browns), the Seattle Seahawks, and the Denver Broncos have never selected a player first overall. The University of Southern California is the college with the most selections with 6, followed by the University of Notre Dame, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of Georgia with 5. Quarterbacks are most commonly selected position with 39, followed by running backs with 23. Of the first overall draft picks, 43 have been selected to a Pro Bowl and 14 have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==First overall picks by NFL team==
The Indianapolis Colts and Los Angeles Rams have each held the first overall pick a total of seven times, the most of any NFL team. This includes the Colts&#x27; time in Baltimore and the Rams&#x27; time in Cleveland and St. Louis. The Boston Yanks are the only defunct franchise to have held a first overall pick. The Baltimore Ravens, Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks are the only teams that have never had the first overall pick.

==First overall picks by school==
USC has the most first overall picks with 6. Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and Georgia are tied for second-most first overall picks with 5 each. Only two schools have had first overall picks in consecutive years: USC, with Ron Yary (1968) and O. J. Simpson (1969), and Oklahoma, with Baker Mayfield (2018) and Kyler Murray (2019).

<text>Moon Unit Zappa (born September 28, 1967) is an American actress, singer, and author. She is the daughter of musician Frank Zappa.

==Early life==
Moon Zappa was born in New York City, the eldest child of Gail (née Sloatman) and musician Frank Zappa. She has three younger siblings: Dweezil, Ahmet, and Diva. Zappa&#x27;s father was of Sicilian, Greek-Arab, and French ancestry, and her mother was of German and Portuguese descent. Zappa attended Oakwood School in North Hollywood, California.

==Career==
Zappa first came to public attention in 1982 at the age of 14, when she appeared on her father&#x27;s hit single &quot;Valley Girl&quot;. The song featured Moon&#x27;s monologue in &quot;valleyspeak&quot;, slang terms popular with teenage girls in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles. &quot;Valley Girl&quot; was Frank Zappa&#x27;s biggest hit in the United States, and popularized phrases from the lyric such as &quot;grody to the max&quot; and &quot;gag me with a spoon&quot;. The song appeared on her father&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch&quot;.

In the mid-1980s, Zappa and her brother Dweezil were frequent guest VJs on MTV.

She sang on Dweezil&#x27;s songs &quot;My Mother Is a Space Cadet&quot; b/w &quot;Crunchy Water&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About It&quot; from the album &quot;Havin&#x27; a Bad Day&quot; in 1986.

As a teenager, Zappa acted in the television series &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, and the film &quot;Nightmares&quot;. While still 18, she was a technical consultant and appeared in several episodes of &quot;Fast Times.&quot; As an adult, she has worked as a stand-up comic, magazine writer, and actress, appearing in the films &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; and &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot;, the television sitcom &quot;Normal Life&quot;, and &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot;.

Zappa appeared as a niqab-clad Muslim woman in an episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, as Ted Mosby&#x27;s cousin Stacy in an episode of &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, and on an episode (&quot;Pampered to a Pulp&quot;) of &quot;Roseanne&quot;. In 2013, Zappa was the voice of Mrs. Lamber on FOX Broadcasting&#x27;s Animation Domination High-Def series &quot;High School USA!&quot;.

In 2000, Zappa appeared as guest vocalist on Kip Winger&#x27;s third solo album &quot;Songs from the Ocean Floor&quot;. She is the author of the novel &quot;America, the Beautiful&quot;, published in 2001. She has also written for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In a 2016 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Zappa said she was working on a book about growing up in her &quot;crazy house&quot;.

Zappa&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Earth to Moon&quot;, was released in August 2024.

==Personal life==
Zappa married Paul Doucette, drummer and rhythm guitarist for American pop group Matchbox Twenty, in June 2002. They have one child, Mathilda Plum Doucette. They divorced in 2014.

Following the death of Zappa&#x27;s mother, Gail, in October 2015, it was revealed that her siblings Ahmet and Diva were given control of the Zappa family trust with shares of 30% each, while Moon and her brother Dweezil were given smaller shares of 20% each. Speaking to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2016, Zappa called it &quot;the most hideous shock of [her] life.&quot; As beneficiaries only, Moon and Dweezil will reportedly not receive any distributions from the trust until it is profitable—, it was millions of dollars in debt—and must seek permission from Ahmet, the trustee, to make money from their father&#x27;s music or merchandise bearing his name.

In 2018, the Zappa siblings were reported to have legally reconciled their differences, with Dweezil noting &quot;It may be a bumpy road at times – we are a passionate Italian family – but we have decided to work toward privately discussing issues rather than using public forums and lawyers.&quot;

<text>Other Dimensions in Music is an American free jazz group founded in the 1980s.

The group is a collective quartet composed of trumpeter Roy Campbell, multi-instrumentalist Daniel Carter, bassist William Parker and drummer Rashid Bakr. Campbell, Parker and Bakr began working together as members of Jemeel Moondoc‘s group Muntu. Other Dimensions In Music came into existence when Carter joined them in 1981. Their third album, &quot;Time is of the Essence is Beyond Time&quot; is a live collaboration with pianist Matthew Shipp. On their next recording, &quot;Live at the Sunset&quot;, drummer Hamid Drake replaces Bakr. &quot;Kaiso Stories&quot; finds the quartet backing vocalist Fay Victor.

The group&#x27;s music is entirely improvised but is generally more melodic than some listeners expect from free jazz.

<text>The World Trade Centers Association (WTCA) was founded in 1970 by Port Authority NYNJ executive Guy F. Tozzoli. WTCA is a not-for-profit, non-political association dedicated to the establishment and operation of World Trade Centers (WTCs) as instruments for international trade expansion.

As of May 2020, the WTCA included 323 properties licensed in 90 countries and staffed by &quot;15,000 WTC professionals&quot;. The WTCA is an unofficial umbrella trade association that unites corporations and government agencies in international trade.

==Licensing fees==
In 2013, it was disclosed that the Association benefited substantially from its use of the &quot;World Trade Center&quot; name after the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey transferred to the Association in 1986 its local rights to the name for a token fee of $10. By licensing the use of the name to its members, including World Trade Center-branded merchandise, the Association generated considerable revenues while absorbing the heavy costs of registering the name and defending it against improper use in many countries. 

The terms of the licensing arrangement were not widely publicized until 2013 when it became known that the Port Authority had supported the mission of the Association by providing rent-free office space and other help, with Association staff serving as the trade assistance arm of the World Trade Center. In December 2018, Laura Taylor Swain, Chief United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, held that the wording of the 1986 assignment to the World Trade Centers Association did not include trademark rights for WORLD TRADE CENTER (such as for souvenir items bearing that mark). The WTCA received only ownership of the mark for services, such as for licensing to entities around the world.

==Principles and governance==
The WTCA&#x27;s founding principles are:
* To encourage the expansion of world trade;
* To promote international business relationships and understanding among nations;
* To foster increased participation in world trade by industrializing nations;
* To create and encourage mutual assistance and cooperation among members; and
* To promote and further the concept of the World Trade Center.

The WTCA is governed by a 24-member international Board of Directors, composed of executives from WTCA members around the world, and elected by the membership. Eight permanent committees have been established to carry on the work of the Association in the following fields:
* Committee on Facilities and Functions
* Committee on International Relations and Development
* Committee on Planning and Finance
* Committee on Public Relations and Information
* Committee on Tourism, Hospitality and Cultural Exchange
* Committee on Trade Education, Training and Research
* Committee on Trade Fairs, Trade Marts and High Tech Parks
* Committee on WTC Standards and Quality
* Committee on Peace &amp; Stability through trade

In December 2008, the WTCA awarded its first Global Corporate Leadership award to Robert Thompson, the founder of CenTradeX of Nashville, Tennessee.

<text>Michael Edward Lowry (March 8, 1939 – May 1, 2017) was an American politician who served as the 20th governor of Washington from 1993 to 1997. His political career ended when his deputy press secretary, Susanne Albright, made accusations of sexual misconduct against him. A member of the Democratic Party, Lowry served as a United States Representative from Washington&#x27;s 7th congressional district from 1979 to 1989, and unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 1983 and 1988.

==Early life==
Lowry was born and raised in St. John, Washington, son of Helen (nee White) and Robert Lowry. He graduated from Washington State University in 1962.

==Political career==
Lowry had a brief career working for the Washington State Senate and as a lobbyist for Group Health Cooperative, before being elected to the King County Council in 1975. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Washington&#x27;s Seventh Congressional District in 1978, where he served until 1989.

Lowry twice ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate. In a 1983 special election, he was defeated by Republican former Governor Dan Evans, then an appointed Senator and the incumbent, in a race to replace Democrat Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson. In 1988, he lost to Slade Gorton, also a Republican, in a close race. Lowry then began working at Seattle University and at an environmental group.

==Governor of Washington (1993–1997)==
Lowry was elected governor in 1992 and served for a single term (to date, he is the last governor of Washington state to serve only one term). His principal policy initiative was a statewide system of health insurance with premiums based on ability to pay. He chose not to run for reelection due to a sexual harassment scandal in which his deputy press secretary, Susanne Albright, accused him of making inappropriate remarks and fondling her. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Commissioner of Public Lands in 2000, and was later active in building affordable housing for Washington&#x27;s migrant farm workers.

==Personal life==

Lowry married Mary Carlson in 1968, and they had a daughter. He died from complications of a stroke on May 1, 2017, at the age of 78.

During Lowry&#x27;s career, he was often compared to Yasser Arafat by both media and political opponents in the state of Washington, due to a perceived similarity in physical appearance between the two. According to some reports, Lowry shaved off a beard he formerly sported specifically to avoid comparisons.

<doc id="588829" wikidata="Q5374330" url="?curid=588829" title="Employment Act of 1946">
<text>The Employment Act of 1946 ch. 33, section 2, 60 Stat. 23, codified as , is a United States federal law. Its main purpose was to lay the responsibility of economic stability of inflation and unemployment onto the federal government. The Act stated: it was the &quot;continuing policy and responsibility&quot; of the federal government to:
:coordinate and utilize all its plans, functions, and resources . . . to foster and promote free competitive enterprise and the general welfare; conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those able, willing, and seeking to work; and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.

Congressional liberals originally intended to secure a federal commitment to &quot;full employment&quot;, though the conservative coalition that controlled Congress at the time prevented this language from being included in the final bill. Stein (1969) notes, &quot;The failure to pass a &#x27;Full Employment Act&#x27; is as significant as the decision to pass the Employment Act.&quot; The Act also created the Council of Economic Advisers, attached to the White House, which provides analysis and recommendations, as well as the Joint Economic Committee. In practice, the government has relied on automatic stabilizers and Federal Reserve policy for macroeconomic management, while the Council of Economic Advisers has focused primarily on discussions of microeconomic issues.

==Background==
By 1940 the Great Depression was finally over. A remarkable burst of economic activity and full employment came during America&#x27;s involvement in World War II (1941–45). Fears of a postwar depression were widespread since the massive military spending was ending, the war plants were shutting down, and 12 million military personnel were coming home. In response, Congress sought to establish preemptive safeguards against an economic downturn.

The White House relied on Keynesian economic theory to develop its strategy. The theory, set forth by economist John Maynard Keynes and his American disciples such as Alvin Hansen at Harvard, contends that unemployment is caused by insufficient aggregate demand relative to the possible aggregate supply generated by full employment. Swings in aggregate demand create a phenomenon known as a business cycle that leads to irregular downsizing and hiring runs, causing fluctuations in unemployment. Keynes argued that the biggest contributor of these shifts in aggregate demand is investment.

==Compromises==
The original bill, called the Full Employment Bill of 1945, was introduced in the House as H.R. 2202 and introduced without change by Congressman Wright Patman in the Senate as S. 380. The bill represented a concerted effort to develop a broad economic policy for the country. In particular, it mandated that the federal government do everything in its authority to achieve full employment, which was established as a right guaranteed to the American people. In this vein, the bill required the President to submit an annual economic report in addition to the national budget. The report, designated the Economic Report of President, must estimate the projected employment rate for the next fiscal year, and if not commensurate with the full employment rate, to mandate policies as necessary to attain it.

There was strong opposition to the wording of the bill from the business community, which feared government regulation, deficit spending and runaway inflation. Conservative Congressmen, led by Republican Senator Robert A. Taft, argued that business cycles in a free enterprise economy were natural and that compensatory spending should not be exercised except in the most extreme of cases. Some also believed that the economy would naturally drive toward full employment levels. Others believed that accurate employment level forecasting by the government was not practical or feasible. Some were uncomfortable with an outright guarantee of employment.

The Conservative Coalition of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats controlled Congress. The bill was pressured to take on a number of amendments that forced the removal of the guarantee of full employment and the order to engage in compensatory spending. Although the spirit of the bill carried through into the Employment Act of 1946, its metaphorical bite was gone. The final act was not so much a mandate as a set of suggestions.

The result was a bill that made the general goals full employment, full production, and stable prices. President Harry S. Truman signed the compromise bill into law on February 20, 1946.

==Overview==
Conservatives removed all of the Keynesian markers from the final bill, so that it merely encourages the federal government to &quot;promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.&quot;

The act requires the President to submit an annual economic report within ten days of the submission of the national budget that forecasts the future state of the economy, including employment, production, capital formation, and real income statistics. This Economic Report of the President, as the act names it, sets forth future economic goals of the country and offers suggestions on how to attain it, a marked compromise from the original bill&#x27;s focus on compensatory spending.

The act creates the Council of Economic Advisers, an appointed advisory board that will advise and assist the President in formulating economic policy. It also creates the Joint Economic Committee, a committee composed of both senators and representatives instructed to review it as the government&#x27;s economic policy at least annually.

==Amendment==
Unemployment levels remained fairly steady after the passing of the act. After 1970, however, the economy began to fluctuate and unemployment rates rose again. The same fears that motivated the creation of the act in 1946 precipitated an amendment in 1978, entitled the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act. This act was identical in spirit to the original Full Employment Bill of 1945, providing a guarantee of full employment and economic means to do so.

==In popular culture==
In the 1995 &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Past Tense,&quot; the Employment Act was repealed, one of the changes in the future of 2024.

<text>William Robert Dixon (October 5, 1925 – June 16, 2010) was an American composer and educator. Dixon was one of the seminal figures in free jazz and late twentieth-century contemporary music. He was also a prominent activist for artist&#x27;s rights and African American music tradition. He played the trumpet, flugelhorn, and piano, often using electronic delay and reverb.

==Biography==
Dixon hailed from Nantucket, Massachusetts, United States. His family moved to Harlem, in New York City, in 1934. He enlisted in the Army in 1944; his unit served in Germany before he was discharged in 1946. His studies in music came relatively late in life, at the Hartnette Conservatory of Music (1946–1951), which he attended on the GI Bill. He studied painting at Boston University and the WPA Arts School and the Art Students League. From 1956 to 1962, he worked at the United Nations, where he founded the UN Jazz Society.

In the 1960s Dixon established himself as a major force in the jazz avant-garde. In 1964, Dixon organized and produced the October Revolution in Jazz, four days of music and discussions at the Cellar Café in Manhattan. The participants included pianist Cecil Taylor and bandleader Sun Ra. It was the first free-jazz festival of its kind. Dixon later co-founded the Jazz Composers Guild, a cooperative organization that sought to create bargaining power with club owners and effect greater media visibility. A key participant in the seminal Judson Dance Theater at Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, New York City, Dixon was one of the first artists to produce concerts mixing free jazz and improvisational dance, spending several years in a close collaboration with dancer Judith Dunn, with whom he formed the Judith Dunn/Bill Dixon Company.

In 1967 RCA Victor released Intents and Purposes, Dixon&#x27;s first album as a leader. During this period, he also co-led some releases with Archie Shepp and appeared on Cecil Taylor&#x27;s Blue Note record &quot;Conquistador!&quot; in 1966. In 1967, he composed and conducted a score for the United States Information Agency film, &quot;The Wealth of a Nation&quot;, produced and directed by William Greaves.

Dixon was Professor of Music at Bennington College, Vermont, from 1968 to 1995, where he founded and chaired the college&#x27;s Black Music Division. From 1970 to 1976, he played &quot;in total isolation from the market places of this music,&quot; as he puts it. Solo trumpet recordings from this period were later released by Cadence Jazz Records and were collected on his self-released multi-CD set &quot;&quot;, along with reproductions of his visual artwork and other material.

He was one of four featured musicians in the Canadian documentary &quot;Imagine the Sound&quot; (along with Cecil Taylor, Archie Shepp, and Paul Bley), 1981.

In the later years of his life, he recorded with Cecil Taylor, Tony Oxley, William Parker, and Rob Mazurek.

Dixon was noted for his extensive use of the pedal register, playing below the trumpet&#x27;s commonly ascribed range and well into the trombone and tuba registers. He also made extensive use of half-valve techniques and used breath with or without engaging the traditional trumpet embouchure. He largely eschewed mutes, the exception being the Harmon mute, with or without stem.

On June 16, 2010, Bill Dixon died in his sleep at his home in North Bennington, Vermont after suffering from an undisclosed illness.

<text>Charles Gayle (February 28, 1939 – September 7, 2023) was an American free jazz musician. Initially known as a saxophonist who came to prominence in the 1990s after decades of obscurity, Gayle also performed as pianist, bass clarinetist, bassist, and percussionist.

==Biography==
Charles Gayle was born on February 28, 1939, in Buffalo, New York. Gayle was often reluctant to talk about himself during interview, so many details of his life are uncertain. He briefly taught music at the University at Buffalo before relocating to New York City during the early 1970s.

Gayle was homeless for approximately twenty years, playing saxophone on street corners and subway platforms around New York City. He had described making a conscious decision to become homeless: &quot;I had to shed my history, my life, everything had to stop right there, and if you live through this, good, and if you don&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t do the rent, the odd jobs, the little rooms, scratchin&#x27;, and all that, no!&quot; At the same time, this allowed Gayle to devote most of his time to playing music, although he often earned less than US$3 a day from busking:
First of all, I played to play because I need to play. Second of all, the money, a dollar meant a lot to me at that time. Playing out there is obviously different than playing on a stage but that is so rich out there. It&#x27;s such a whole &#x27;nother world of playin&#x27;. I mean I used to walk from Times Square, for instance, all the way to Wall Street playin&#x27;. I could walk back and never stop playing. I didn&#x27;t think about it as anything other than what it was. These were people and I wasn&#x27;t overly concerned with what they thought. I was playing, I had to play. Also I had to eat some way and I&#x27;m not the type to put my hand out. I&#x27;d stand there playing with a coffee cup sometime and people would put money in my coffee [Laughs] and you don&#x27;t get that on the stage. That&#x27;s beautiful.
When Gayle first set out on the streets, he did not imagine he would remain homeless as long as he did, although he estimated that this period lasted closer to fifteen years than twenty.

In 1988, he gained fame through a trio of albums recorded in one week and released by Swedish label, Silkheart Records. 

Gayle&#x27;s music is spiritual, intended to express his religious beliefs, and heavily inspired by the Old and New Testaments. Gayle explained, &quot;I want the people to enjoy the music and if it, in anyway can suggest something about the Lord, for their benefit, that would be first in my mind.&quot; He had explicitly dedicated several albums to God. His childhood was influenced by religion, and his musical roots trace to black gospel music. He had performed and recorded with Cecil Taylor, William Parker, and Rashied Ali. Perhaps Gayle&#x27;s most celebrated work is the album &quot;Touchin&#x27; on Trane&quot; (FMP) with Parker and Ali, which received the &quot;Crown&quot; accolade from the &quot;Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot;.

Though he established his reputation primarily as a tenor saxophonist, he had increasingly turned to other instruments, notably the piano (his original instrument), violin, bass clarinet and alto saxophone. More controversially, he had sometimes included lengthy spoken-word addresses to the audience in his concerts touching on his political and religious beliefs: &quot;I understand that when you start speaking about faith or religion, they want you to keep it in a box, but I&#x27;m not going to do that. Not because I&#x27;m taking advantage of being a musician, I&#x27;m the same everywhere, and people have to understand that.&quot; Gayle sometimes performed as a mime, &quot;Streets the Clown.&quot; &quot;Streets means to me, first, a freedom from Charles. I&#x27;m not good at being the center of attention…. It&#x27;s a liberation from Charles, even though it&#x27;s me on the stage, it&#x27;s a different person.&quot;

Gayle appears in the 1985 Jazz documentary, &quot;Rising Tones Cross&quot;, directed by Ebba Jahn. He is seen playing with Rashied Ali, Marilyn Crispell, and many others, and is interviewed.

Charles Gayle died in Brooklyn, New York on September 7 2023, at the age of 84. He had suffered from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>The Athlone Institute of Technology (AIT; ) was an institute of technology, located in Athlone, Ireland. Established in 1970, the institute&#x27;s campus was located on University Road.

A consortium between itself and the Limerick Institute of Technology was announced with the intention of forming a technological university. On 23 November 2020, the AIT-LIT Consortium announced that the joint Limerick-Athlone IT application for technological university (TU) status had been submitted for approval, which was granted in May 2021.

On 16 July 2021, the institute of technology was officially dissolved and succeeded by the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, which began operations on 1 October 2021.

== History ==
The Athlone Institute of Technology (AIT) was established by the Irish government in 1970 as the Athlone Regional Technical College, under control of the local Vocational Education Committee. The college gained more autonomy with the enactment of the &quot;Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992&quot;. In late 1997, as with the other RTC&#x27;s, it was renamed as the Athlone Institute of Technology (AIT). In 1999, AIT became a validation authority with the power to award HETAC degrees.

In 2000, Ciarán Ó Catháin was appointed as the institute&#x27;s president. Dr. David Fenton and James Coyle were previous holders of the post, having been called director and principal. In 2001, a School of Humanities was opened. In 2010, then-president of Ireland Mary McAleese spoke at the fortieth anniversary of the college.

The AIT had a campus size of 44 acres, and new, purpose-built facilities that included the Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure Studies building, built in 2003; the Nursing and Health Science building and the Midlands Innovation and Research Centre, built in 2005; as well as the Engineering and Informatics building and the Postgraduate Research Hub, built in 2010. RTÉ&#x27;s Midlands studio and office have been located at the institute.

The institute had a memorandum of understanding with the Rio de Janeiro State University, one of the largest universities in the Brazilian city. It also had agreements with the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais, one of the largest Brazilian private universities. The institute also founded agreements with two leading Beijing universities, the Capital University of Economics and Business and the Beijing Union University. The agreements were signed by the Chinese Ambassador to Ireland and university representatives. Other agreements existed between the institute and TVTC, in Saudi Arabia, and a memorandum of understanding existed with the Georgia Institute of Technology. Further agreements existed with the Bharati Vidyapeeth, one of the largest universities in India.

=== College of sanctuary ===
In 2017, AIT became the first designated college of sanctuary in Ireland.

=== AIT-LIT Consortium and dissolution ===
In 2018, the institute had investigated the possibility of becoming a university in its own right. A consortium between itself and the Limerick Institute of Technology was announced in October 2019 with the intention of forming a technological university. On 23 November 2020, the AIT-LIT Consortium announced that the joint Limerick-Athlone IT application for technological university (TU) status had been submitted for approval. Approval was announced in May 2021 by minister of Higher Education, Simon Harris.

On 16 July 2021, both itself and the Limerick Institute of Technology were officially dissolved through a signed order by the minister. The institute was succeeded by the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, which began operations on 1 October 2021.

== Facilities ==
* The Goldsmith Library, named after Oliver Goldsmith, novelist, playwright and poet
* McCormack Hall, performance venue named after John McCormack, tenor
* Northgate street, former site of art and design, to be converted in to a digital hub

=== AIT International Arena ===

An international athletics arena with an overall building floor area of 9,715 m2 was opened in early 2013. The arena can house 2,000 spectators and was constructed at a cost of €10 million.

<doc id="588846" wikidata="Q3827688" url="?curid=588846" title="Formative case">
<text>In the Hungarian language the essive-formal case or formative case can be viewed as combining an essive case and a formal case, and it can express the position, task, state (e.g. &quot;as a tourist&quot;), or the manner (e.g. &quot;like a hunted animal&quot;).

==Grammatical status: case vs. adverb-forming suffix==
Some earlier analyses of the Hungarian case system, such as László Antal&#x27;s (1961) did not consider the essive-formal to be a case, and disputed the status of the suffix in the declension system. One reason for this was that while Hungarian case suffixes are absolute word-final, permits further suffixation by the locative suffix . However, this is not unique to the essive-formal; can follow other case suffixes, for example in , though it has become less common since the early 20th century (e.g. ). Another reason was that most Hungarian case endings participate in vowel harmony, while does not, possibly due to its later development. 

However, the essive-formal case complies with the criterion for Hungarian cases set by modern descriptive grammars, namely that it can appear as the argument of a verb, specified in its form, such as in (’treat, handle as ...’), (’behave as ...’), (’graduate as ...’), (’find employment as ...’) etc. Therefore, it is today considered as one of the 18 established and acknowledged cases in Hungarian, rather than being one of the adverb-forming suffixes, which do not comply with the criterion.

<text>Dixy Lee Ray (September 3, 1914 – January 2, 1994) was an American academic, scientist, and politician who served as the 17th governor of Washington from 1977 to 1981. Variously described as idiosyncratic and &quot;ridiculously smart,&quot; she was the state&#x27;s first female governor and was in office during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. She was a supporter of atomic energy.

A graduate of Mills College and Stanford University, where she earned a doctorate in biology, Ray became an associate professor at the University of Washington in 1957. She was chief scientist aboard the schooner SS &quot;Te Vega&quot; during the International Indian Ocean Expedition. Under her guidance, the nearly bankrupt Pacific Science Center was transformed from a traditional, exhibit-oriented museum to an interactive learning center, and returned to solvency.

In 1973, Ray was appointed chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) by President Richard Nixon. Under her leadership, research and development were separated from safety programs, and Milton Shaw, the head of the powerful reactor development division, was removed. She was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs by President Gerald Ford in 1975, but resigned six months later, complaining about lack of input into department decision making.

Ray ran for election as Governor of Washington as a Democrat in 1976. She won the election despite her blunt, sometimes confrontational, style. As governor, she approved allowing supertankers to dock in Puget Sound, championed support for unrestrained growth and development, and continued to express enthusiasm for atomic energy. On April 3, 1980, she declared a state of emergency as a result of the volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens. She retired after losing her re-election bid for the Democratic nomination later that year.

== Early life and education ==
Ray was born Marguerite Ray in Tacoma, Washington, to Frances Adams Ray and Alvis Marion Ray, the second in a family of five girls. She joined the Girl Scouts and, at the age of 12, became the youngest girl, up to that time, to summit Mount Rainier. In 1930, at age 16, she legally changed her name to &quot;Dixy Lee&quot;; as a child she had been referred to by family members as &quot;little Dickens&quot; (an idiom for &quot;devil&quot;) and Dixy was a shortened form of the nickname. She chose &quot;Lee&quot; because of a family connection to Robert E. Lee.

Ray attended Tacoma&#x27;s Stadium High School and graduated as valedictorian from Mills College in Oakland, California, in 1937, working her way through school as a waitress and janitor. She went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree in 1938. Her thesis was titled &quot;A Comparative Study of the Life Habits of Some Species of Burrowing Eumalacostraca.&quot; Ray spent the next four years teaching science in the Oakland Unified School District. In 1942, a John Switzer Fellowship allowed her to enter a doctoral program in biology at Stanford University. Ray&#x27;s dissertation was &quot;The peripheral nervous system of Lampanyctus leucopsarus&quot;, a lanternfish. She completed the research for her dissertation in 1945 at the Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California. She is known to have lived a rather unconventional lifestyle, calling her house trailer and two dogs home, and therefore contributing a diverse perspective to the Washington bureaucracy. 

== Scientific career ==

=== University of Washington ===
In 1945, Ray returned to Washington to accept a position as an instructor in the zoology department at the University of Washington. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1947 and, five years later, received a prestigious John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellowship grant, which she used to undertake six months of postdoctoral research at Caltech. In 1957, she was made an associate professor at the University of Washington. During her time there, she also served as chief scientist aboard the schooner SS &quot;Te Vega&quot; during the International Indian Ocean Expedition. Her reputation in the classroom swung between wild extremes; students either &quot;loved her or loathed her&quot;, as did faculty members. One fellow professor reportedly described her as &quot;an intemperate, feeble-minded old bitch&quot;.

=== KCTS-TV and Pacific Science Center ===

Intrigued by her reputation as a person who could &quot;make science interesting,&quot; producers at KCTS-TV, Seattle&#x27;s PBS member station, approached Ray about hosting a weekly television program on marine biology. The show, &quot;Animals of the Seashore&quot;, was a hit and helped propel her into the public eye beyond campus. Her growing popularity led the Pacific Science Center to invite Ray to take over the nearly-bankrupt science museum for an annual salary of $20,000. Ray jumped at the opportunity and immediately began a top-to-bottom overhaul of the center, declaring &quot;I&#x27;ll be damned if I&#x27;m going to become a landlady to a hoary old museum.&quot; Under Ray&#x27;s guidance, the Pacific Science Center was converted from a traditional, exhibit-oriented museum to an interactive learning center.

Ray&#x27;s hands-on approach to running the Pacific Science Center reflected at every level. She kept a police whistle in her desk that she would use to run off loitering hippies. Jim Anderson, who would eventually teach fisheries science at the University of Washington, recalled a typical encounter with Ray, for whom he worked at the Pacific Science Center in 1968:

Ray led the Pacific Science Center back into financial solvency. Her aggressive fundraising for the center also helped introduce her to many of the city&#x27;s most influential citizens, including Senator Warren Magnuson.

== Government ==

===Atomic Energy Commission===
An advocate of nuclear power, in 1973 Ray was appointed by Richard Nixon to chair the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on the recommendation of Senator Warren Magnuson. The offer of appointment came via a telephone call after she was paged in an airport. After being told she would have to relocate to Washington, D.C., Ray declined the offer, saying &quot;I&#x27;m living where I like to live.&quot; Nonetheless, she ultimately relented after being persuaded by her longtime friend Lou Guzzo.
Following her appointment to the commission, news of her personal eccentricities began to emerge after reporters discovered she was living out of a 28-foot motor home, which was parked on a lot in rural Virginia. Each morning she was chauffeured from her RV to the AEC offices in Germantown, Maryland, accompanied by her Scottish deerhound Ghillie and a miniature poodle named Jacques. Media reports commented on her unusual hosiery (white knee socks).

Her personal quirks were widely perceived as a weakness by tenured bureaucrats. A profile by Graham Chedd in &quot;New Scientist&quot; explained that,


However, less than a year after taking over, Ray had forced Shaw out, ordering that research and development be separated from safety programs as some environmental groups had demanded. In addition to its research responsibilities, the AEC was charged with the manufacture of nuclear weapons for the U.S. military. Ray would later fondly recall the first time she saw a nuclear warhead, describing it &quot;like a piece of beautiful sculpture, a work of the highest level of technological skill.&quot;

During her time as commission chair, which lasted until the AEC was abolished in 1975, Ray presented a 17-year-old Eric Lander with first place in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search.

=== U.S. State Department ===
In 1975, Ray was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs by Gerald Ford, but resigned five months later, complaining about lack of input into department decision making. She subsequently told a United States Senate committee that she &quot;saw Secretary of State Henry Kissinger only once – the day she was sworn in as an assistant secretary of state.&quot; In a parting shot as she left D.C., Ray declared that &quot;anything the private sector can do, the government can do it worse.&quot;

== Governor of Washington (1977–1981)==

=== Campaign and election ===
To the surprise of many, Ray announced in 1975 she would seek election as Governor of Washington. Later asked why she decided to make her first run for public office the highest office in the state, she would reason, &quot;I was much too old to start at the bottom, so I decided to start at the top.&quot; Though previously politically unaffiliated, she declared herself a Democrat.

Ray displayed a blunt, sometimes confrontational, style on the campaign trail, for which she would later become known. During a visit with the Dorian Society, a Seattle gay rights group, she was asked by one member if she had met any gay federal employees and if they ever felt under pressure. Ray responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know any – you can&#x27;t tell by looking at them,&quot; drawing applause from attendees. In another instance, she declared &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; reporter Shelby Scates, who had deluged her with tough questions on the campaign trail, would &quot;learn what the words &quot;persona non grata&quot; really mean&quot; after her election.

Ray narrowly won the Democratic nomination over Seattle mayor Wes Uhlman, having spent almost no money on her campaign, having no experience in running for elected office, and having little support from the state&#x27;s political class. Despite opposition from all major newspapers and predictions from pundits that the state was not ready &quot;for an unmarried woman who gave herself a chainsaw for Christmas,&quot; Ray went on to win the general election with a victory over King County Executive John D. Spellman, 53%–44%. On election night, asked by a reporter to explain her surprise victory, she offered, &quot;it can&#x27;t be because I&#x27;m so pretty?&quot;

=== &quot;the best governor ... or the worst&quot; ===
After assuming office, Ray tightened Washington state spending and began an audit of state salaries and programs. She balanced the state budget and during her tenure as Governor oversaw the state&#x27;s first full funding for basic public education. As the first resident of the Governor&#x27;s Mansion without a First Lady, Ray hired her elder sister Marion R. Reid to serve as her official hostess.

Nonetheless, she quickly alienated fellow Democrats with her conservative views on energy and the environment. She approved allowing supertankers to dock in Puget Sound, championed support for unrestrained growth and development, and continued to express enthusiasm for atomic power. She likewise alienated the state&#x27;s Republican establishment after she fired 124 appointees of her predecessor, three-term governor Daniel J. Evans, offering to send them &quot;a box of kleenex with their pink slips.&quot; She filled their places with old colleagues, described by some as &quot;yes men.&quot; Her treatment of the media was similarly dismissive. Local television reporter Paul Boyd once interviewed the governor while she was dressed in &quot;a ratty Ban-lon sports shirt, sweat pants covered with dog hair, red socks, and tennis shoes.&quot;

Ray&#x27;s uncompromising belief in the correctness of her views occasionally spilled over state lines. During what was supposed to be a routine joint press conference in Boise, Idaho, by the governors of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in which the three touted the benefits of energy conservation, Ray reacted with barely concealed disdain to Oregon governor Robert W. Straub&#x27;s call for legislation to encourage the installation of home insulation. &quot;I don&#x27;t believe our citizens are lax, or lazy, or indifferent,&quot; Ray fired. &quot;In Washington we have a strong voluntary energy conservation program. We don&#x27;t need legislative incentives.&quot;

Back in Washington, Ray sometimes engaged in elaborate ceremony; on her inauguration she hosted not just one but nine inaugural balls. To promulgate House Bill 491, a relatively minor $13 million appropriations measure, she had nearly 1,000 people assembled in the rotunda of the Legislative Building (the Associated Press noted, at the time, that it was ordinarily &quot;unusual for more than a dozen people to show up&quot; to bill signings, which would customarily be held in the governor&#x27;s office).

Press and political opposition solidified in the face of her unyielding style of governance. In a critical 1977 article in &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, Ray Mungo labeled Ray as a &quot;slightly wacky Miss Marple&quot; and described the increasingly madcap atmosphere in Washington:


Ralph Nader, during a visit to the state, called Ray&#x27;s administration &quot;gubernatorial lunacy.&quot; Ray&#x27;s own campaign manager, Blair Butterworth, vaguely quipped, &quot;we thought she would be the best governor Washington ever had, or the worst, and we were right.&quot; Support from her fellow scientists, however, was often positive; Edward Teller called Ray &quot;a very wonderful lady&quot; and said he would support her if she ran for President of the United States in the 1980 election.

=== State of emergency ===
On April 3, 1980, Ray declared a state of emergency as a result of the worsening threat of volcanic eruption posed by Mount St. Helens. Warning that &quot;the possibility of a major eruption or mudflow is real,&quot; she urged a sometimes skeptical public to stay away from the mountain.

The emergency decree was followed, on April 30, by the declaration of a &quot;red zone&quot; in southwestern Washington where public access would be banned and relocation of the population would be compelled by state troops, if necessary. Ray ordered the Washington National Guard mobilized and the deployment of the Washington State Patrol to reinforce the sheriffs of Cowlitz County and Skamania County in carrying out her declaration, with violation punishable by six months imprisonment. The U.S. Forest Service later credited the red zone restrictions with saving 5,000 to 30,000 people from certain death. At the same time, however, Ray was criticized for establishing a parallel &quot;blue zone&quot; where the public was generally banned, but Weyerhaeuser loggers were permitted. (When the mountain finally erupted, 11 of those killed were loggers operating in the blue zone. A subsequent lawsuit by families of the deceased, alleging negligence against the state, would be summarily dismissed in court for lack of evidence.) After the eruption, Ray would falsely claim that all killed were near the mountain illegally while it was found all but one individual was allowed to be there. On the day of the eruption a request to expand the blue zone sat on Ray&#x27;s desk unsigned.

As a scientist, Ray was fascinated by the possibility of an eruption. In the weeks leading up to the fateful event, Ray flew to the mountain in the governor&#x27;s plane, circling the peak and remarking, &quot;I&#x27;ve always said I wanted to live long enough to see one of our volcanoes erupt.&quot; The cataclysmic eruption of the mountain, which occurred on May 18, 1980, killed 57 people. The level of devastation caused by the ensuing ash cloud, earthquakes, electrical storms, and flooding was unprecedented and, the following day, Ray invoked her emergency powers to postpone local elections, which had been scheduled for May 20.

Ray ran for reelection in 1980, enlisting Republican consultant Montgomery Johnson to head her campaign after her former manager, Butterworth, had defected to her rival, then-State Senator Jim McDermott. She lost to McDermott in a contentious Democratic primary election, 56%–41%, during which bumper stickers emblazoned with &quot;Nixy on Dixy&quot; and &quot;Ditch the Bitch&quot; became popular campaign tchotchkes. McDermott himself went on to lose in the general election to Republican John D. Spellman.

=== After politics ===

After leaving office, Ray retired to her farm on Fox Island. She was frequently in the news giving her opinion of current events. The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; quoted her as saying she favored &quot;abolishing political parties and taking away voting rights from anyone who fails to vote in two consecutive elections.&quot; During her retirement she co-authored two books with Lou Guzzo critical of the environmentalist movement. In one of those books, &quot;Trashing the Planet&quot;, she described environmentalists as &quot;mostly white, middle to upper income and predominantly college educated ... they are distinguished by a vocal do-good mentality that sometimes cloaks a strong streak of elitism that is often coupled with a belief that the end justifies the means.&quot;

=== Death and legacy ===
Dixy Lee Ray died on January 2, 1994, at her home. Shortly before her death, it was reported that she had had a bronchial infection, which led to pneumonia, as the cause of her death. Later, controversy erupted after it emerged that employees of the Pierce County medical examiner&#x27;s office had kept autopsy photos of Ray as souvenirs.

Ray&#x27;s death was met with opinionated reflections on her life by her many friends and enemies. She was eulogized by her successor as governor, John Spellman, as &quot;one of a kind.&quot; &quot;She had a brilliant mind,&quot; Spellman said. &quot;Her strength was as a teacher and a lecturer. She had this really bubbling personality. People weren&#x27;t quite used to anybody that outspoken. But whatever she said, people still loved her.&quot;

Former state senator Gordon Walgren, who had been indicted on federal racketeering charges based on evidence collected by the State Patrol during Ray&#x27;s term, recalled her in different tones. &quot;I&#x27;m sure she made valuable contributions as an educator,&quot; Walgren noted. &quot;I can&#x27;t remember any as governor.&quot;

Ray&#x27;s friend and a co-author in two of her books, Lou Guzzo, concluded that &quot;she should have never gone into politics.&quot; &quot;We thought it was time for someone in politics who tells the truth all the time,&quot; Guzzo recalled. &quot;It didn&#x27;t work.&quot;

In 2014, veteran Seattle journalist Knute Berger opined that Ray was ahead of her time. &quot;It&#x27;s interesting to note that many of her views are either mainstream or are creeping back into acceptability,&quot; Berger wrote.

After her death, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) established an award in Dixy Lee Ray&#x27;s honor for engineering contributions to the field of environmental protection. The award, which consists of a bronze medal with the governor&#x27;s likeness and a cash grant, was first given to Clyde W. Frank in 1999 and has been made annually since.

Ray&#x27;s papers, totaling 190 boxes of records and memorabilia spanning her career, are in deposit at the Hoover Institution Library and Archives at Stanford University.

=== Honors ===
* 1958: Clapp Award in Marine Biology
* 1973: Frances K. Hutchinson Medal for Service in Conservation
* 1973: United Nations Peace Medal
* 1974: Francis Boyer Science Award
* 1979: Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Edward Teller at the Achievement Summit in Salt Lake City, Utah

Ray was the recipient of twenty honorary doctorates from U.S. and foreign universities.

=== Sexual orientation ===

The subject of Dixy Lee Ray&#x27;s sexual orientation was carefully avoided in public discussion both during, and after, her life. While there were many rumors regarding her sexuality, the specific word &quot;lesbian&quot; was never used to describe her and many people have dismissed those rumors as speculation born of Ray&#x27;s tomboy characteristics and unmarried status, rather than informed assessment.

<doc id="588850" wikidata="Q924820" url="?curid=588850" title="Heavenly (French band)">
<text>Heavenly is a French power metal band based in Marseille that was formed in 1993 in Paris by vocalist Benjamin Sotto and drummer Max Pilo, originally as a cover band under the name of Satan&#x27;s Lawyer. In 1994, they changed their name to &quot;Heavenly&quot; and evolved into a full-fledged Helloween-influenced power metal outfit. In 1998, they released a three-track demo with new guitarist Anthony Parker. However, Parker&#x27;s time with the band was to be short lived, leaving before a record deal with Noise Records was clinched. Heavenly then found a replacement in Chris Savourey and completed their lineup with bassist Laurent Jean.

The band was signed on Noise Records in 1999. In 2000, Heavenly released their debut album &quot;Coming from the Sky&quot;. Although it was largely shunned by the media, the album proved a hit with metal fans and its success helped Heavenly land an appearance at the French Hard Rock Festival. With the arrival of a keyboardist, Frédéric Leclercq, and the replacement of departed bassist Laurent Jean with Piere-Emmanuel Pelisson, Heavenly underwent another lineup change shortly before they supported Stratovarius on their &#x27;Infinite&#x27; tour. Chris Savourey left soon afterwards, and Frédéric Leclercq took on his role as the band&#x27;s guitarist.

Heavenly released their second album &quot;Sign of the Winner&quot; in 2001, and received positive feedback from both fans and media alike. For their following support slot on Edguy&#x27;s European tour, Charley Corbiaux joined as a second guitarist, and has since become a permanent addition to Heavenly&#x27;s ranks.

After appearing at Wacken Open Air (the world&#x27;s biggest metal festival) in 2002, Heavenly set to work recording their third album, &quot;Dust to Dust&quot;, which was eventually released in early 2004.

In 2006, Heavenly released their fourth album, titled &quot;Virus&quot;. It is a departure from previous efforts, incorporating less double-bass drumming and expanding Sotto&#x27;s vocal range.

They opened for Scorpions during their 2007 French tour.

In December 2009, they released their fifth album &quot;Carpe Diem&quot;.

In April 2020, they announced on their Facebook page that they were working on a new album. In October 2022, they performed a setlist including a new track, &quot;Be United, Be the One&quot;, at a festival in Vouziers.

<doc id="588852" wikidata="Q1183901" url="?curid=588852" title="Delative case">
<text>In grammar, the delative case (abbreviated ; from &quot;to bear or bring away or down&quot;) is a grammatical case in the Hungarian language which originally expressed the movement from the surface of something (e.g. &quot;off the table&quot;), but has also taken on several other meanings (e.g. &quot;about people&quot;), some of which are related to the original (e.g. &quot;from the post office&quot;).

In addition to obvious movement off a surface (such as a table), Hungarian uses the delative case to express the origin of movement from some cities and places; when one is expressing that something comes from (or is coming from) a place, the name of the place is put into the delative case. Generally, Hungary itself and most Hungarian cities are placed into the delative case (foreign cities and some Hungarian cities use the elative case in this context).

:I came from Budapest (). 
:The train from Hungary () is coming ().

With the same meaning as in Hungarian (where something comes from, origin of movement), the delative is also used for some words as an adverbial case in Finnish, e.g.: 

* - from here
* - from over there
* - from there
* - from elsewhere
* - from elsewhere, on the other hand
* - from one place

<doc id="588855" wikidata="Q2120615" url="?curid=588855" title="Sublative case">
<text>In grammar, the term sublative case (abbreviated ) is used to refer to grammatical cases expressing different situations: In Hungarian and Finnish (rarely used), it expresses the destination of the movement, originally to the surface of something (e.g. sit down on the ground, climb the tree), but in other figurative meanings as well (e.g. to university, for two nights), or into a language, while in Tsez and other Northeast Caucasian languages it denotes a movement towards the bottomsides or the area under an object. The sublative case is used in the Finnish, Tsez and Hungarian languages.

== Hungarian ==
In Hungarian the suffix &quot;-re&quot; or &quot;-ra&quot; denotes the sublative. It can be used like &quot;onto&quot; but also in more abstract cases for flat areas (cities, airports). For example:
* &quot;hajóra&quot; (onto the boat)
* &quot;Budapestre megyek&quot; (I am going to Budapest)
* &quot;repülőtérre&quot; (to the airport)

== Finnish ==
Examples in Finnish:
* &quot;minne&quot; - where to?
* &quot;jonne&quot; - where (relative pronoun)
* &quot;moniaalle&quot; - to many places
* &quot;kaikkialle&quot; - to everywhere

<doc id="588858" wikidata="Q6040919" url="?curid=588858" title="Institute of Technology, Tallaght">
<text>The Institute of Technology Tallaght (also known as ITT or IT Tallaght) (Irish: Institiúid Teicneolaíochta, Tamhlacht) was a third-level institution in Tallaght, the largest suburb of Dublin, Ireland. Established in 1992, IT Tallaght offered degree and postgraduate courses as well as adult education courses. On 1 January 2019 it was dissolved and its operations merged into the new Technological University Dublin (TUD). Its campus is now the Tallaght Campus of TUD.

==History==
The institute was established as Tallaght Regional Technical College, in 1992, and was at the time the final new Regional Technical College opened in Ireland. It was built on lands donated for educational use to the Irish government by the Dominican Orders, St. Mary&#x27;s Priory lands, in Tallaght. Qualifications were accredited by the NCEA (the forerunner to HETAC).

The institute adopted the abbreviated title of &quot;ITT Dublin&quot; in 2005, to differentiate it from IT Tralee; this did not change the legal name which continued to be &quot;Institute of Technology, Tallaght&quot; as stated in the Institutes of Technology Act, 2006. In 2016, the institute re-branded as ITT.

From 2011, IT Tallaght validated Theology degrees from The Priory Institute, located adjacent to the campus in Tallaght.

In 2013, it was announced that IT Tallaght, IT Blanchardstown and the Dublin Institute of Technology intended to apply for Technical University Status. On 1 January 2019, this Technical University was founded under the name of &#x27;Technological University Dublin&#x27;, amalgamating all three institutions.

==Faculties and courses==
The institute offered a variety of courses, including Higher Certificates and Bachelor&#x27;s Degrees as well as postgraduate courses in the schools of accountancy, business, computing, engineering, humanities and science.

==Student life==
IT Tallaght had many clubs and societies for students, including Drama, Radio, Soccer, Martial Arts, Computing and Snow Sports.

The institute also had a Radio Society broadcasting as &quot;ITTFM&quot; on 99.1FM. It broadcast twice annually, in February in line with the institute&#x27;s RAG (Raising And Giving) week, and also in September for Freshers Week. When not broadcasting on FM, it streamed online through its website, www.ittfm.ie.

IT Tallaght was in the process of redeveloping land donated by the Dominicans of St Mary&#x27;s Priory (with whom ITT worked closely in providing theology courses at The Priory Institute), for use as sports pitches.

==Technical==
The institute was the hub of the ITnet network.

<doc id="588859" wikidata="Q302368" url="?curid=588859" title="Twenty questions">
<text>Twenty questions is a spoken parlor game which encourages deductive reasoning and creativity. It originated in the United States and was played widely in the 19th century. It escalated in popularity during the late 1940s, when it became the format for a successful weekly radio quiz program.

In the traditional game, the &quot;answerer&quot; chooses something that the other players, the &quot;questioners&quot;, must guess. They take turns asking a question which the answerer must answer with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. In variants of the game, answers such as &quot;maybe&quot; are allowed. Sample questions could be: &quot;Is it bigger than a breadbox?&quot;, &quot;Is it alive?&quot;, and finally &quot;Is it this pen?&quot; Lying is not allowed. If a questioner guesses the correct answer, they win and become the answerer for the next round. If 20 questions are asked without a correct guess, then the answerer has stumped the questioners and gets to be the answerer for another round.
Careful selection of questions can greatly improve the odds of the questioner winning the game. For example, a question such as &quot;Does it involve technology for communications, entertainment or work?&quot; can allow the questioner to cover a broad range of areas using a single question that can be answered with a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, significantly narrowing down the possibilities.

==Popular variants==
A variant is called &quot;animal, vegetable, or mineral&quot;. This is taken from the Linnaean taxonomy of the natural world. In this version, the answerer tells the questioners at the start of the game whether the subject belongs to the animal, vegetable or mineral kingdom. These categories can produce odd technicalities, such as a wooden table being classified as a vegetable (since wood comes from trees), or a belt being both animal (if leather) or vegetable (if cloth), and mineral (if it has a metal or plastic buckle). Another variant is &quot;person, place, or thing&quot;.

Other versions specify that the item to be guessed should be in a given category, such as actions, occupations, famous people, etc. In Hungary a similar game is named after Simon bar Kokhba. A version of twenty questions called yes and no is played as a parlor game by characters in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

==Computers, scientific method and situation puzzles==

The abstract mathematical version of the game where some answers may be wrong is sometimes called Ulam&#x27;s game or the Rényi–Ulam game. The game suggests that the information (as measured by Shannon&#x27;s entropy statistic) required to identify an arbitrary object is at most 20 bits. The game is often used as an example when teaching people about information theory. Mathematically, if each question is structured to eliminate half the objects, 20 questions allow the questioner to distinguish between 220 = objects. Accordingly, the most effective strategy for twenty questions is to ask questions that will split the field of remaining possibilities roughly in half each time. The process is analogous to a binary search algorithm in computer science or successive-approximation ADC in analog-to-digital signal conversion.

In 1901 Charles Sanders Peirce discussed factors in the economy of research that govern the selection of a hypothesis for trial: (1) cheapness, (2) intrinsic value (instinctive naturalness and reasoned likelihood), and (3) relation (caution, breadth, and incomplexity) to other projects (other hypotheses and inquiries). He discussed the potential of twenty questions to single one subject out from among 220 and, pointing to skilful caution, said:

He elaborated on how, if that principle had been followed in the investigation of light, its investigators would have saved themselves half a century of work. Testing the smallest logical components of a hypothesis one at a time does not mean asking about, say, subjects one at a time, but extracting aspects of a guess or hypothesis, and asking, for example, &quot;Did an animal do this?&quot; before asking &quot;Did a horse do this?&quot;.

That aspect of scientific method resembles also a situation puzzle in facing (unlike twenty questions) a puzzling scenario at the start. Both games involve asking yes/no questions, but Twenty Questions places a greater premium on efficiency of questioning. A limit on their likeness to the scientific process of trying hypotheses is that a hypothesis, because of its scope, can be harder to test for truth (test for a &quot;yes&quot;) than to test for falsity (test for a &quot;no&quot;) or vice versa.

In developing the participatory anthropic principle (PAP), which is an interpretation of quantum mechanics, theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler used a variant on twenty questions, called &quot;surprise twenty questions&quot;, to show how the questions we choose to ask about the universe may dictate the answers we get. In this variant, the respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand, but only on a pattern of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answers. This variant requires the respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions, so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all the previous answers. In this way, successive questions narrow the options until the questioner settles upon a definite object. Wheeler&#x27;s theory was that, in an analogous manner, consciousness may play some role in bringing the universe into existence.

==Radio and TV quiz==
===United States===
In the 1940s, the game became a popular radio panel quiz show, &quot;Twenty Questions&quot;, first broadcast at 8 pm, Saturday, February 2, 1946, on the Mutual Broadcasting System from New York&#x27;s Longacre Theatre on West 48th Street. Radio listeners sent in subjects for the panelists to guess in twenty questions; Winston Churchill&#x27;s cigar was the subject most frequently submitted. On the early shows, listeners who stumped the panel won a lifetime subscription to &quot;Pageant&quot;. From 1946 to 1951, the program was sponsored by Ronson lighters. In 1952–1953, Wildroot Cream-Oil was the sponsor.

As a television series, &quot;Twenty Questions&quot; debuted as a local show in New York on WOR-TV Channel 9 on November 2, 1949. Beginning on November 26, the series went nationwide on NBC until December 24, after which it remained dormant until March 17, 1950, when it was picked up by ABC until June 29, 1951. Some of the early TV episodes were simulcast on WOR-TV, WNBT-TV and Mutual radio. 

Its longest and best-known run, however, is the one on the DuMont Television Network from July 6, 1951, to May 30, 1954. During this time, original host Bill Slater was replaced by Jay Jackson. After this run ended, ABC picked up the series once again from July 6, 1954, to May 3, 1955. The last radio show had been broadcast on March 27, 1954.

=== Canada ===
&quot;Twenty Questions&quot; aired locally on CJAY-TV in Winnipeg, Canada from March to June, 1961 and then on the new CTV network beginning in September, 1961; its host, Stewart Macpherson, went on to become the original host of the UK version.

=== Hungary ===
In Hungary, the game is known as , named after Simon bar Kokhba, the leader of the second-century Jewish uprising against the Romans. The story goes that the Romans cut out a spy&#x27;s tongue, so when he reached bar Kokhba&#x27;s camp, he was only able to nod or shake his head to answer bar Kokhba&#x27;s questions. The number of questions is not limited to twenty.

 was played by Frigyes Karinthy and his company in Budapest back in 1911. So the game started in Hungary from the New York café in Budapest.

 was staged as a television game show (later renamed ) on the Hungarian national television Magyar Televízió from 1975 to 1991. It was the first show presented by István Vágó, who would later host the Hungarian versions of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; () and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; ().

=== Ireland ===
A bi-lingual (Irish/English) version of Twenty Questions aired on RTE Radio 1 in the 1960s and 1970s. It was hosted by Gearóid Ó Tighearnaigh, written by Dick O&#x27;Donovan and produced by Bill O&#x27;Donovan (occasional panelist) and included Dominic O’Riordan, Tony Ó Dálaigh, Seán Ó Murchú and Máire Noone on the panel. It proved enormously popular, travelling the length and breadth of Ireland, hosted in local clubs and community halls.

=== Norway ===
NRK aired its own version continuously from 1947 to the early 1980s. In 2004, the radio series was revived and regained its popularity, leading to a 2006 TV version. The Norwegian continues on NRK radio and TV, and a web-based game is available at the official NRK website. A 2006 board game based on the series is currently the prize sent to listeners who beat the panel.

=== Poland ===
Polish version, was shown in TVP1 in 1960s, hosts were Ryszard Serafinowicz and Joanna Rostocka. In Polish version there were three 3-player teams: mathematicians, journalists and mixed team from Łódź. Show was cancelled due to scandal, when it turned out that mathematicians used binary search algorithm to answer the questions, using to it Wielka Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN.

=== United Kingdom ===
The BBC aired a version on radio from 28 February 1947 to 1976 with TV specials airing in 1947 and 1948 plus a series from 1956 to 1957. On radio, the subject to be guessed was revealed to the audience by a &quot;mystery voice&quot; (originally Norman Hackforth from 1947 to 1962; he was later a regular panelist). Hackforth became well known amongst the British public as much for his aloofness as his apparent knowledgeability.

The series was originally presented by Stewart MacPherson. The panel comprised Richard Dimbleby, Jack Train, Anona Winn and Joy Adamson, in later years comedian Peter Glaze also. A later presenter, Gilbert Harding, was ousted in 1960 by producer Ian Messiter when, after having drunk a triple gin-and-tonic he had originally offered to Messiter, proceeded to completely ruin the night&#x27;s game – he insulted two panelists, failed to recognise a correct identification after seven questions (after revealing the answer upon the 20th question, he yelled at the panel and audience), and ended the show three minutes early by saying &quot;I&#x27;m fed up with this idiotic game ... I&#x27;m going home&quot;. He was replaced by Kenneth Horne until 1967, followed by David Franklin from 1970 to 1972.

A revival ran for one season in the 1990s on BBC Radio 4, hosted by Jeremy Beadle. A version with a rival line-up, produced by commercial station Radio Luxembourg, is not acknowledged by the BBC. Another revival, under the title &quot;Guess What?&quot;, was hosted by Barry Took for a single series in 1998.

A televised version ran from 1960 to 1961, produced by Associated-Rediffusion for ITV and hosted by Peter Jones (who later hosted in 1974). The &quot;mystery voice&quot; later became a running gag on the radio series &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t A Clue&quot;.

The BBC World Service also broadcast a version called &quot;Animal, Vegetable and Mineral&quot;, chaired by Terry Wogan with a panel including Rachael Heyhoe Flint and Michael Flanders.

In the movie &quot;The 20 Questions Murder Mystery&quot; (1950) then members of the team, including Richard Dimbleby and Norman Hackforth, appear. Together with two newspaper reporters, they work to find the identity of a serial killer who sends in questions for the panel that prefigure his next victim.

<text>The essive-modal case is a case in the Hungarian language that expresses either the state, capacity, task in which somebody is or which somebody has (essive case, e.g. &quot;as a reward&quot;, &quot;for example&quot;), or the manner in which an action is carried out, an event happens, or the language which somebody knows (modal case, e.g. &quot;sloppily&quot;, &quot;unexpectedly&quot;, &quot;speak &quot;German&quot;&quot;). It is sometimes called the essive case.

An example of this would be in the sentence &quot;Beszélek magyarul.&quot; (I speak Hungarian.) The sentence denotes the ability of being able to speak the Hungarian language. According to vowel harmony rules, ul becomes ül in cases such as &quot;Beszélek németül.&quot; (I speak German.) because the word for &quot;German&quot;, &quot;német&quot; is composed completely of median and/or frontal vowels.

<text>The distributive case (abbreviated ) is used on nouns for the meanings of &#x27;per&#x27; or &#x27;each.&#x27;

In Hungarian it is and expresses the manner when something happens to each member of a set one by one (e.g., &quot;per head&quot;, &quot;in some case&quot;), or the frequency in time ( &quot;once a week&quot;, &quot;every ten minutes&quot;).

In the Finnish language, this adverb type is rare, even rarer in the singular. Its ending is . The basic meaning is &quot;separately for each&quot;. For example, (&quot;country&quot;) becomes for an expression like (&quot;The law is ratified separately in each country&quot;). It can be used to distribute the action to frequent points in time, e.g., (day) has the plural distributive (each day).

It can mean also &quot;in (or with) regard to the (cultural) perspective&quot; when combined with a word referring to an inhabitant (). Frequently Finns () say that , or &quot;in the Finnish perspective, it feels strange that ...&quot;.
