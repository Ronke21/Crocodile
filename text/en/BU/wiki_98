<text>Birsa Munda (15 November 1875 – 9 June 1900) was an Indian tribal independence activist, and folk hero who belonged to the Munda tribe. He spearheaded a tribal religious millenarian movement that arose in the Bengal Presidency (now Jharkhand) in the late 19th century, during the British Raj, thereby making him an important figure in the history of the Indian independence movement. The revolt mainly concentrated in the &quot;Munda belt&quot; of Khunti, Tamar, &quot;Sarwada&quot; and &quot;Bandgaon.&quot;

Birsa received his education in Salga under the guidance of his teacher Jaipal Nag. Later, Birsa converted to Christianity to join the German Mission School. After dropping out of school, Birsa Munda created a faith called &quot;Birsait&quot;. Members of the Munda community soon started joining the faith which in turn became a challenge for the British activities.The Birsaits openly declared that the real enemies were the British and not Christian Mundas.
The cause of the Munda revolt was the &#x27;unfair land grabbing practices by colonial and local authorities that demolished the tribal conventional land system&#x27;. Birsa Munda is known for challenging the British Christian missionaries and revolting against the conversion activities along with the Munda and Oraon communities. His portrait hangs in the Indian Parliament Museum.

==Early life (1875–1886)==
Birsa Munda was born on 15 November 1875, at the village of Ulihatu in Ranchi district of Bengal Presidency – now in Khunti district of Jharkhand – on a Thursday (Some sources claim he was born on 18 July 1872, and not in 1875) and hence named after that day, according to the then prevalent Munda custom. The folk songs reflect popular confusion and refer to Ulihatu or Chalkad as his birthplace. Ulihatu was the birthplace of Sugana Munda, father of Birsa. The claim of Ulihatu rests on Birsa&#x27;s elder brother Komta Munda living in the village, where his house still exists albeit in a dilapidated condition.

Birsa&#x27;s father, mother Karmi Hatu, and younger brother, Pasna Munda, left Ulihatu and proceeded to Kurumbda, near Birbanki, in search of employment as labourers (&quot;sajhedari&quot;) or crop-sharers (ryots). At Kurumbda, Birsa&#x27;s elder brother, Komta, and his sister, Daskir, were born. From there the family moved to Bamba where Birsa&#x27;s elder sister Champa was born.

Birsa&#x27;s early years were spent with his parents at Chalkad. His early life could not have been very different from that of an average Munda child. Folklore refers to his rolling and playing in sand and dust with his friends, and his growing up strong and handsome in looks; he grazed sheep in the forest of Bohonda. When he grew up, he shared an interest in playing the flute, in which he became an expert. He went around with the tuila, the one-stringed instrument made from the pumpkin, in his hand and the flute strung to his waist. Exciting moments of his childhood were spent on the akhara (the village wrestling ground). However, one of his ideal contemporaries and who went out with him heard him speak of strange things.

Driven by poverty Birsa was taken to Ayubhatu, his maternal uncle&#x27;s village. Komta Munda, his eldest brother, who was ten years of age, went to Kundi Bartoli, entered the service of a Munda, married and lived there for eight years, and then joined his father and younger brother at Chalkad. Birsa lived at Ayubhatu for two years. He went to school at Salga, run by one Jaipal Nag. He accompanied his mother&#x27;s younger sister, Joni, who was fond of him, when she was married, to Khatanga, her new home. He came in contact with a Christian missionary who visited a few families in the village which had been converted to Christianity. Birsa Munda understood very soon that Christian missionaries were converting tribals to Christianity. Birsa soon started to challenge the Christian missionaries and revolted against the conversion activities along with the Munda and Oraon communities.

As Birsa was sharp in his studies, Jaipal Nag recommended him to join the German Mission School and Birsa converted to Christianity and was renamed as Birsa David, which later became Birsa Daud. After studying for a few years, he left the German Mission School.

== Formative period (1886–1894) ==
Birsa&#x27;s stay at Chaibasa from 1886 to 1890 constituted a formative period of his life. This period was marked by the German and Roman Catholic Christian agitation. In light of the independence struggle, Sugana Munda withdrew his son from school. Soon after leaving Chaibasa in 1890 Birsa and his family gave up their membership in the German mission, ceased being Christian, and reverted to his original traditional tribal religious system.

He left Gerbera in the wake of the mounting Sardar agitation. He participated in the agitation stemming from popular disaffection at the restrictions imposed upon the traditional rights of the Mundas in the protected forest, under the leadership of Gideon of Piring in the Porhat area. During 1893–94 all waste lands in villages, the ownership of which was vested in the Government, were constituted into protected forests under the Indian Forest Act VII of 1882. In West Singhbhum as in Lohardaga, the forest settlement operations were launched and measures were taken to determine the rights of the forest-dwelling communities. Villages in forests were marked off in blocks of convenient size consisting of village sites and cultivable wastelands sufficient for the needs of villages. In 1894, Birsa had grown up into a strong young man, shrewd and intelligent, and undertook the work of repairing the Dombari tank at Gerbera damaged by rains.

While on a sojourn in the neighbourhood of village Sankara in West Singhbhum district, he found a suitable companion, presented her parents with jewels, and explained his idea of marriage. Later, on his return from jail, he did not find her faithful to him and left her. Another woman who served him at Chalkad was the sister of Mathias Munda. On his release from prison, the daughter of Mathura Munda of Koensar who was kept by Kali Munda, and the wife of Jaga Munda of Jiuri insisted on becoming wives of Birsa. He rebuked them and referred the wife of Jaga Munda to her husband. Another rather well-known woman who stayed with Birsa was Sali of Burundi.

Birsa stressed monogamy at a later stage in his life. Birsa rose from the lowest ranks of the peasants, the ryots, who unlike their namesakes elsewhere enjoyed far fewer rights in the Mundari khuntkatti system; while all privileges were monopolized by the members of the founding lineage, the ryots were no better than crop-sharers. Birsa&#x27;s experience as a young boy, driven from place to place in search of employment, gave him insight into the agrarian question and forest matters; he was no passive spectator but an active participant in the movement going on in the neighbourhood.

== Revival of tribal religion ==
Birsa is credited for reviving the traditional tribal culture which was mostly negatively affected by British Christian missionary works. Many tribals under his sect had already converted to Christianity. He opposed and criticised the Church and its practices such as levying of taxes and religious conversions. In 1895, Birsa is said to have seen a vision of a supreme God. He himself became a preacher and a representative of their traditional tribal religion, and soon, he built up a reputation of a healer, a miracle-worker, and a preacher. The Mundas, Oraons, and Kharias flocked to Chalkad to see him and to be cured of their ailments. Both the Oraon and Munda population up to Barwari and Chechari became convinced Birsaities. Contemporary and later folk songs commemorate the tremendous impact of Birsa on his people, their joy, and expectations at his advent. The name of &quot;Dharti Aaba&quot; was on everybody&#x27;s lips.

Birsa Munda started to advise tribal people to pursue their original traditional tribal religious system. Impressed by his teachings, he became a saintly figure to the tribal people and they sought his blessings.

==Tribal movement==
Birsa Munda&#x27;s slogan threatening the British Raj&quot;Abua raj ete jana, maharani raj tundu jana&quot; (&quot;Let the kingdom of the queen be ended and our kingdom be established&quot;)is still remembered in areas of Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.

The British colonial system intensified the transformation of the tribal agrarian system into a feudal state. As the tribals with their primitive technology could not generate a surplus, the non-tribal peasantry was invited by the chiefs in Chhotanagpur to settle on and cultivate the land. This led to the alienation of the lands held by the tribals. The new class of Thikadars was of a more rapacious kind and eager to make the most of their possessions.

In 1856 Jagirs stood at about 600, and they held from a village to 150 villages. But by 1874, the authority of the old Munda or Oraon chiefs had been almost entirely annulled by that of the farmers, introduced by the landlords. In some villages, they had completely lost their proprietary rights and had been reduced to the position of farm labourers.

To the twin challenges of agrarian breakdown and culture change, Birsa along with the Munda responded through a series of revolts and uprisings under his leadership. In 1895, in Chalkad village of Tamar, Birsa Munda renounced Christianity, asked his fellow tribesmen to &quot;worship only one God&quot; and give up the worship of &quot;bongas&quot;.

He declared himself a prophet who had come to recover the lost kingdom of his people. He said that the reign of Queen Victoria was over and the Munda Raj had begun. He gave orders to the &quot;&quot; (tenant farmers) to pay no rents. The Mundas called him &quot;Dharati Baba&quot;, the father of earth.

Due to a rumor that those who didn&#x27;t follow Birsa would be massacred, Birsa was arrested on 24 August 1895 and sentenced to two-year imprisonment. On 28 January 1898, after being released from jail he went with his followers to Chutia to collect the record and to re-establish racial links with the temple. He said that the temple belonged to the Kols. The Christian missionaries wanted to arrest Birsa and his followers, who were threatening their ability to make converts. Birsa went underground for two years but attending a series of secret meetings.

It is said that around 7000 men and women assembled around Christmas of 1899, to herald the &quot;Ulgulaan&quot; (Great Tumult) which soon spread to Khunti, Tamar, Basia, and Ranchi. The Anglican Mission at Murhu and the Roman Catholic Mission at Sarwada were the main targets. The Birsaits openly declared that the real enemies were the British and not Christian Mundas and called for a decisive war against the British. He allegedly urged the killing of Thikadars and Jagirdars and Rajas and Hakims and Christians and promised that the guns and bullets would turn to water. For two years, they attacked places loyal to the British.

On Christmas Eve of 1899, Birsa&#x27;s followers tried to burn down churches in Ranchi and Singhabhum. On 5 January 1900, Birsa&#x27;s followers killed two police constables at Etkedih. On 7 January, they attacked the Khunti police station, killing a constable and razing the houses of local shopkeepers. The local commissioner, A. Fobes, and deputy commissioner, H.C. Streattfield, rushed to Khunti with a force of 150 men to suppress the growing rebellion. The colonial administration also set a reward of Rs 500 for Birsa. The troops under the command of Fobes and Streattfield attacked and defeated Munda&#x27;s guerillas at Dumbari Hill, though Munda himself escaped to the Singhbum hills.

He was arrested at Jamkopai forest in Chakradharpur on 3 February 1900. According to Deputy commissioner Ranchi, vide letter, 460 tribals were made accused in 15 different criminal cases, out of which 63 were convicted. One was sentenced to death, 39 to transportation for life and 23 to imprisoned for terms up to fourteen years. There were six deaths, including that of Birsa Munda in the prison during trials. Birsa Munda died in jail on 9 June 1900. After his death, the movement faded out. In 1908, the colonial government introduced the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act (CNT), which prohibits the transfer of tribal land to non-tribals.

Birsa Munda&#x27;s arrest was a major achievement for the British. On 6 February 1900, Bengal’s Lieutenant Governor informed the Home Department via telegram. On 8 February the news was shared with Sir Arthur Godley in London. Earlier, on 9 January 1900, police fired on Birsa&#x27;s supporters at Sail Rakab Hill in Dumari, but the death toll remains unknown.

==Legacy==
The Union cabinet, at a meeting held on 10 November 2021, voted to observe 15 November, Birsa Munda&#x27;s birth anniversary, as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas, to remember the contribution of tribal independence activist. His birth anniversary is still celebrated by tribal people as far away as Mysore and Kodagu districts in Karnataka. The official celebration takes place at his &quot;samadhi sthal&quot; in the Kokar neighbourhood of Ranchi, the capital of Jharkhand.

Today, there are several organizations, bodies, and structures named after him, notably Birsa Munda Airport Ranchi, Birsa Institute of Technology Sindri, Birsa Munda International Hockey Stadium Rourkela,(World&#x27;s largest Hockey Stadium), Birsa Munda Vanvasi Chattravas, Kanpur, Sidho Kanho Birsha University, Purulia, and Birsa Agricultural University. The war cry of Bihar Regiment is &quot;Birsa Munda Ki Jai&quot; (Victory to Birsa Munda).

The Statue of Ulgulan is a proposed 150-foot-tall statue of Birsa Munda to be built in Jharkhand with stones collected from households in the region.

Ulgulan, the annual college festival of the National University of Study and Research in Law, in Ranchi, is inspired by the independence struggle of Birsa Munda.

Gopi Nainar, the director of Aramm, is set to direct a movie, in Tamil, on the life of Birsa Munda. Well known Tamil director and anti-caste activist Pa. Ranjith will direct a Hindi movie which is based on Birsa Munda&#x27;s life.

==In popular culture==
In 2004, a Hindi film, &quot;Ulgulan-Ek Kranti&quot; (&quot;The Revolution&quot;) was made by Ashok Saran. Deepraj Rana played Birsa Munda in the film, and 500 &quot;Birsaits&quot; (followers of Birsa) appeared as extras. Another film, &quot;Birsa Munda – The Black Iron Man&quot;, by Rajesh Mittal was released the same year.

In 2008, a Hindi film based on the life of Birsa, &quot;Gandhi Se Pehle Gandhi&quot; (&quot;Gandhi Before Gandhi&quot;), was directed by Iqbal Durrani, based on his own novel of the same name. &quot;Bhagwan Birsa Munda&quot;, an Indian biographical short film by Rajan Khosa, was released in 2020.

Ramon Magsaysay Award winner, writer-activist Mahasweta Devi&#x27;s historical fiction, &quot;Aranyer Adhikar&quot; (&quot;Right to the Forest&quot;, 1977), a novel for which she won the Sahitya Akademi Award for Bengali in 1979, is based on his life and the Munda Rebellion against the British Raj in the late 19th century; she later wrote an abridged version, &quot;Birsa Munda&quot;, specifically for young readers.

<doc id="609614" wikidata="Q863787" url="?curid=609614" title="Continuously variable transmission">
<text>A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is an automated transmission that can change through a continuous range of gear ratios, typically resulting in better fuel economy in gasoline applications. This contrasts with other transmissions that provide a limited number of gear ratios in fixed steps. The flexibility of a CVT with suitable control may allow the engine to operate at a constant angular velocity while the vehicle moves at varying speeds.

CVTs are used in cars, tractors, side-by-sides, motor scooters, snowmobiles, bicycles, and earthmoving equipment. The most common type of CVT uses two pulleys connected by a belt or chain; however, several other designs have also been used at times.

== Types ==
=== Pulley-based ===
The most common type of CVT uses a V-belt which runs between two variable-diameter pulleys. The pulleys consist of two cone-shaped halves that move together and apart. The V-belt runs between these two halves, so the effective diameter of the pulley is dependent on the distance between the two halves of the pulley. The V-shaped cross-section of the belt causes it to ride higher on one pulley and lower on the other; therefore, the gear ratio is adjusted by moving the two sheaves of one pulley closer together and the two sheaves of the other pulley farther apart.

As the distance between the pulleys and the length of the belt does not change, both pulleys must be adjusted (one bigger, the other smaller) simultaneously to maintain the proper amount of tension on the belt. Simple CVTs combining a centrifugal drive pulley with a spring-loaded driven pulley often use belt tension to effect the conforming adjustments in the driven pulley. The V-belt needs to be very stiff in the pulley&#x27;s axial direction to make only short radial movements while sliding in and out of the pulleys.

The radial thickness of the belt is a compromise between the maximum gear ratio and torque. Steel-reinforced V-belts are sufficient for low-mass, low-torque applications like utility vehicles and snowmobiles, but higher-mass and -torque applications such as automobiles require a chain. Each element of the chain must have conical sides that fit the pulley when the belt is running on the outermost radius. As the chain moves into the pulleys the contact area gets smaller. As the contact area is proportional to the number of elements, chain belts require many very small elements.

A belt-driven design offers approximately 88% efficiency, which, while lower than that of a manual transmission, can be offset by enabling the engine to run at its most efficient RPM regardless of the vehicle&#x27;s speed. When power is more important than economy, the ratio of the CVT can be changed to allow the engine to turn at the RPM at which it produces the greatest power.

In a chain-based CVT, numerous chain elements are arranged along multiple steel bands layered over one another, each of which is thin enough to easily bend. When part of the belt is wrapped around a pulley, the sides of the elements form a conical surface. In the stack of bands, each band corresponds to a slightly different drive ratio, and thus the bands slide over each other and need sufficient lubrication. An additional film of lubricant is applied to the pulleys. The film needs to be thick enough to prevent direct contact between the pulley and the chain, but thin enough to not waste power as each chain element enters it.

Some CVTs transfer power to the output pulley via tension in the belt (a &quot;pulling&quot; force), while others use compression of the chain elements (where the input pulley &quot;pushes&quot; the belt, which in turn pushes the output pulley).

Positively Infinitely Variable (PIV) chain drives are distinct in that the chain positively interlocks with the conical pulleys. This is achieved by having a stack of many small rectangular plates in each chain link that can slide independently from side-to-side. The plates may be quite thin, around a millimeter thick. The conical pulleys have radial grooves. A groove on one side of the pulley is met with a ridge on the other side and so the sliding plates are pushed back and forth to conform to the pattern, effectively forming teeth of the correct pitch when squeezed between the pulleys. Due to the interlocking surfaces, this type of drive can transmit significant torque and so has been widely used in industrial applications. However, the maximum speed is significantly lower than other pulley-based CVTs. The sliding plates will slowly wear over years of usage. Therefore the plates are made longer than is needed, allowing for more wear before the chain must be refurbished or replaced. Constant lubrication is required and so the housing is usually partially filled with oil.

=== Toroidal ===
Toroidal CVTs, as used on the Nissan Cedric (Y34), and those built by CVTCORP, consist of a series of discs and rollers. The discs can be pictured as two almost-conical parts arranged point-to-point, with the sides dished such that the two parts could fit into the central hole of a torus. One disc is the input, and the other is the output. Between the discs are rollers, which vary the ratio and transfer power from one side to the other. When the rollers&#x27; axes are perpendicular to the axis of the discs, the effective diameter is the same for the input discs and the output discs, resulting in a 1:1 drive ratio. For other ratios, the rollers are rotated along the surfaces of the discs so that they are in contact with the discs at points with different diameters, resulting in a drive ratio of something other than 1:1.

An advantage of a toroidal CVT is the ability to withstand higher torque loads than a pulley-based CVT. In some toroidal systems, the direction of thrust can be reversed within the CVT, removing the need for an external device to provide a reverse gear.

=== Ratcheting ===
A ratcheting CVT uses a series of one-way clutches or ratchets that rectify and sum only &quot;forward&quot; motion. The on-off characteristics of a typical ratchet means that many of these designs are not continuous in operation (i.e. technically not a CVT), but in practice, there are many similarities in operation, and a ratcheting CVT is able to produce a zero-output speed from any given input speed (as per an Infinitely Variable Transmission). The drive ratio is adjusted by changing linkage geometry within the oscillating elements so that the summed maximum linkage speed is adjusted, even when the average linkage speed remains constant.

Ratcheting CVTs can transfer substantial torque because their static friction actually increases relative to torque throughput, so slippage is impossible in properly designed systems. Efficiency is generally high because most of the dynamic friction is caused by very slight transitional clutch speed changes. The drawback to ratcheting CVTs is the vibration caused by the successive transition in speed required to accelerate the element, which must supplant the previously operating and decelerating power-transmitting element.

The design principle dates back to before the 1930s, with the original design intended to convert rotary motion to oscillating motion and back to rotary motion using roller clutches. This design remains in production as of 2017, for use with low-speed electric motors. An example prototyped as a bicycle transmission was patented in 1994. The operating principle for a ratcheting CVT design, using a Scotch yoke mechanism to convert rotary motion to oscillating motion and non-circular gears to achieve uniform input to output ratio, was patented in 2014.

=== Hydrostatic/hydraulic ===
A hydrostatic CVT uses an engine-driven, positive-displacement pump to deliver oil under pressure to one or more hydraulic motors, the latter creating the torque that is applied to the vehicle&#x27;s driving wheel(s).  The name &quot;hydrostatic CVT&quot;, which misuses the term &quot;hydrostatic&quot;, differentiates this type of transmission from one that incorporates a hydrodynamic torque multiplier (&quot;torque converter&quot;) into its design.

In a hydrostatic CVT, the effective &quot;gear ratio&quot; between the engine and the driving wheel(s) is the result of a difference between the pump&#x27;s displacement—expressed as cubic inches or cubic centimeters per revolution—and the motor&#x27;s displacement. In a closed system, that is, a system in which all of the pump&#x27;s output is delivered to the motor(s), this ratio is given by the equation &#x27;, where &#x27; is the pump&#x27;s effective displacement, &#x27; is the motor&#x27;s displacement, and &#x27; is the &quot;gear ratio&quot;.

In a hydrostatic CVT, the effective &quot;gear ratio&quot; is varied by varying effective displacement of the pump, which will vary the volume of oil delivered to the motor(s) at a given engine speed (RPM).  There are several ways in which this may be accomplished, one being to divert some of the pump&#x27;s output back to the reservoir through an adjustable valve.  With such an arrangement, as more oil is diverted by opening the valve, the effective displacement of the pump is reduced and less oil is delivered to the motor, causing it to turn more slowly.  Conversely, closing the valve will reduce the volume of oil being diverted, increasing the effective displacement of the pump and causing the motor to turn more rapidly.

Another method is to employ a variable displacement pump.  When the pump is configured for low displacement, it produces a low volume of oil flow, causing the hydraulic motor(s) to turn more slowly.  As the pump&#x27;s displacement is increased, a greater volume of oil flow is produced for any given engine RPM, causing the motor(s) to turn faster.

Advantages of a hydrostatic CVT include:
* Capacity scalability.  A hydrostatic CVT&#x27;s power-transmission capacity is readily adapted to the application by using a correctly-sized pump and matching hydraulic motor(s).
* Flexibility.  As power transfer from the engine-driven pump to the hydraulic motor(s) is through the medium of flowing oil, the motor(s) can be mounted in otherwise-inconvenient locations by using hoses to convey oil from the pump to the motor(s), thus simplifying the design of all-wheel drive articulated vehicles.
* Smoothness.  As the effective &quot;gear ratio&quot; of a hydrostatic CVT is infinitely-variable, there are no distinct transitions in torque multiplication, such as produced with conventional, geared transmissions.
* Simplified control.  Operation through the full range of forward and reverse speeds can be controlled using a single lever or a foot pedal to actuate a diversion valve or variable-displacement pump.
* Arbitrarily slow crawl speeds.  The potential for high torque multiplication at very low speeds allows for precise vehicle movement while under load.

Disadvantages of a hydrostatic CVT include:
* Reduced efficiency.  Gears are one of the most efficient methods of mechanical power transmission, with efficiencies as high as 90 percent in many cases.  In contrast, few hydrostatic transmission systems achieve more than about 65 percent efficiency.  This is due to a combination of internal losses in the pump and motor(s), and losses in the piping and valves.
* Higher cost.  For a given level of power-transmitting capacity, a hydrostatic CVT will be more expensive to produce than an equivalent geared transmission.  In addition to the pump and motor(s), a hydrostatic system requires the use of an oil reservoir, piping and in many applications, an oil cooler, this last item being necessary to dissipate the waste heat that results from hydrostatic power transmission&#x27;s relatively low efficiency.
* Greater weight.  Due to the high oil pressure at which a hydrostatic CVT operates, the pump and motor(s) are under considerable mechanical stress, especially when maximum power and loading is being applied.  Hence these items must be very robust in construction, typically resulting in heavy components.  Additional weight will be found in the oil reservoir and its oil load, as well as the piping and valving.

Uses of hydrostatic CVTs include forage harvesters, combine harvesters, small wheeled/tracked/skid-steer loaders, crawler tractors, and road rollers.  One agricultural example, produced by AGCO, splits power between hydrostatic and mechanical transfer to the output shaft via a planetary gear in the forward direction of travel (in reverse, the power transfer is fully hydrostatic).  This arrangement reduces the load on the hydrostatic portion of the transmission when in the forward direction by transmitting a significant portion of the torque through more efficient fixed gears.

A variant called the &quot;Integrated Hydrostatic Transaxle&quot; (IHT) uses a single housing for both hydraulic elements and gear-reducing elements and is used in some mini-tractors and ride-on lawn mowers.

The 2008–2010 Honda DN-01 cruiser motorcycle used a hydrostatic CVT in the form of a variable-displacement axial piston pump with a variable-angle swashplate.

=== Cone ===
A cone CVT varies the drive ratio by moving a wheel or belt along the axis of one or more conical rollers. The simplest type of cone CVT, the single-cone version, uses a wheel that moves along the slope of the cone, creating variation between the narrow and wide diameters of the cone.

Some cone CVT designs use two rollers. In 1903, William Evans and Paul Knauf applied for a patent on a continuously variable transmission using two parallel conical rollers pointing in opposite directions and connected by belts that could be slid along the cones to vary the transmission ratio. The Evans Variable Speed Countershaft, produced in the 1920s, is simpler—the two rollers are arranged with a small constant-width gap between them, and the position of a leather cord that runs between the rollers determines the transmission ratio.

=== Epicyclic ===
In an epicyclic CVT (also called a planetary CVT), the gear ratio is shifted by tilting the axes of spherical rollers to provide different contact radii, which in turn drive input and output discs. This is similar in principle to toroidal CVTs. Production versions include the NuVinci CVT.

=== Hybrid electric ===
Several hybrid electric vehicles—such as the Toyota Prius, Nissan Altima, Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and Ford Escape Hybrid—use electric variable transmissions (EVTs, sometimes eCVT) to control the contribution of power from the electric motor and the internal combustion engine. These differ from standard CVTs in that they are powered by an electric motor in addition to the engine, often using planetary gears to combine their outputs instead of a belt used in traditional CVTs. A notable example is the Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive.

=== Other types ===
Friction-disk transmissions were used in several vehicles and small locomotives built in the early 20th century, including the Lambert and Metz automobiles. Used today in snow blowers, these transmissions consist of an output disk that is moved across the surface of the input disk upon which it rolls. When the output disk is adjusted to a position equal to its own radius, the resulting drive ratio is 1:1. The drive ratio can be set to infinity (i.e. a stationary output disk) by moving the output disk to the center of the input disk. The output direction can also be reversed by moving the output disk past the center of the input disk. The transmission on early Plymouth locomotives worked this way, while on tractors using friction disks, the range of reverse speeds was typically limited.

Still in development, the magnetic CVT transmits torque using a non-contact magnetic coupling. The design uses two rings of permanent magnets with a ring of steel pole pieces between them to create a planetary gearset using magnets. It is claimed to produce a 3 to 5 percent reduction in fuel consumption compared to a mechanical system.

== Infinitely variable transmissions ==
Some CVTs can also function as an &quot;infinitely variable transmission&quot; (IVT) which offers an infinite range of low gears (e.g. moving a vehicle forward at an infinitely slow speed). Some IVTs prevent back driving (where the output shaft can freely rotate, like an automotive transmission in neutral) due to providing high back-driving torque. Other IVTs, such as ratcheting types, allow the output shaft to freely rotate. The types of CVTs which are able to function as IVTs include epicyclic, friction-disk, and ratcheting CVTs.

== History ==
In 1879, Milton Reeves invented a CVT (then called a &quot;variable-speed transmission&quot;) for use in sawmilling. In 1896, Reeves began fitting this transmission to his cars, and the Reeves CVT was also used by several other manufacturers.

The 1911 Zenith Gradua 6HP motorcycle used a pulley-based &quot;Gradua&quot; CVT. A year later, the Rudge-Whitworth Multigear was released with a similar but improved CVT. Other early cars to use a CVT were the 1913–1923 David small three-wheeled cyclecars built in Spain, the 1923 Clyno built in the U.K., and the 1926 Constantinesco Saloon built in the U.K.

== Applications ==
=== Passenger vehicles ===

The first mass-production car to use a CVT was the 1958 DAF 600 from the Netherlands. Its Variomatic transmission was used in several vehicles built by DAF and Volvo until the 1980s.

In 1987, the &quot;ECVT&quot;, the first electronically controlled steel-belted CVT, was introduced as an optional transmission on the Subaru Justy, Production was limited to 500 units per month due to Van Doorne&#x27;s limited production output. In June of that year, supplies increased to 3,000 per month, leading Subaru to make the CVT available in the Rex kei car. Subaru has also supplied its CVTs to other manufacturers (e.g., the 1992 Nissan Micra and Fiat Uno and Panda). Also in 1987, second-generation Ford Fiesta and first-generation Fiat Uno were introduced with steel-belted CVTs, which are called CTX and Unomatic in Ford and Fiat, respectively.

The 1996 sixth-generation Honda Civic introduced a pulley-based &quot;Honda Multi Matic&quot; (HMM) CVT which included a multi-plate clutch, not a torque converter, to prevent idle creep.

Use of CVTs then spread in the following years to models including the 1998 Nissan Cube, 1999 Rover 25 and 1999 Audi A6.

The 1999 Nissan Cedric (Y34) used a toroidal CVT—unlike the pulley-based designs used by other manufacturers—marketed as the &quot;Nissan Extroid&quot;, which incorporated a torque converter. Nissan then switched from toroidal to pulley-based CVTs in 2003. The version of the CVT used with the VQ35DE engine in the fourth-generation Nissan Altima is claimed to be capable of transmitting higher torque loads than other belt CVTs.

The 2019 Toyota Corolla (E210) is available with a CVT assisted by a physical &quot;launch gear&quot; alongside the CVT pulley. At speeds of up to , the launch gear is used to increase acceleration and reduce stress on the CVT. Above this speed, the transmission switches over to the CVT.

Marketing terms for CVTs include &quot;Lineartronic&quot; (Subaru), &quot;Xtronic&quot; (Jatco, Nissan, Renault), INVECS-III (Mitsubishi), Multitronic (Volkswagen, Audi), &quot;Autotronic&quot; (Mercedes-Benz) and &quot;IVT&quot; (Hyundai, Kia).

=== Racing cars ===
In the United States, Formula 500 open-wheel racing cars have used CVTs since the early 1970s. CVTs were prohibited from Formula One in 1994 (along with several other electronic systems and driving aids) due to concerns over escalating research and development costs and maintaining a specific level of driver involvement with the vehicles.

=== Small vehicles ===
Many small vehicles—such as snowmobiles, golf carts, and motor scooters—use CVTs, typically of the pulley variety. CVTs in these vehicles often use a rubber belt with a non-stretching fixed circumference manufactured using various highly durable and flexible materials, due to the mechanical simplicity and ease of use outweighing their comparative inefficiency. Some motor scooters include a centrifugal clutch, to assist when idling or manually reversing the scooter.

The 1974 Rokon RT340 TCR Automatic off-road motorcycle was fitted with a snowmobile CVT. The first ATV equipped with a CVT was the Polaris Trail Boss in 1985.

=== Farm and earthmoving equipment ===
Combine harvesters used variable belt drives as early as the 1950s. Many small tractors and self-propelled mowers for home and garden use simple rubber belt CVTs. Hydrostatic CVTs are more common on the larger units. In mowing or harvesting operations, the CVT allows the forward speed of the equipment to be adjusted independently of the engine speed; this allows the operator to slow or accelerate as needed to accommodate variations in the thickness of the crop.

Hydrostatic CVTs are used in small- to medium-sized agricultural and earthmoving equipment. Since the engines in these machines are typically run at constant power output (to provide hydraulic power or to power machinery), losses in mechanical efficiency are offset by enhanced operational efficiency. For example, in earthmoving equipment, the forward-reverse shuttle times are reduced. The speed and power output of the CVT is used to control the travel speed and sometimes steering of the equipment. In the latter case, the required speed differential to steer the equipment can be supplied by independent CVTs, allowing the steering to be accomplished without several drawbacks associated with other skid steer methods (such as braking losses or loss of tractive effort).

The 1965 Wheel Horse 875 and 1075 garden tractors were the first such vehicles to be fitted with a hydrostatic CVT. The design used a variable-displacement swash-plate pump and fixed-displacement gear-type hydraulic motor combined into a single compact package. Reverse ratios were achieved by reversing the flow of the pump through over-centering of the swashplate. Acceleration was limited and smoothed through the use of pressure accumulator and relief valves located between the pump and motor, to prevent the sudden changes in speed possible with direct hydraulic coupling. Subsequent versions included fixed swash plate motors and ball pumps.

The 1996 &quot;Fendt Vario 926&quot; was the first heavy-duty tractor to be equipped with a IVT transmission. It is not the same thing as a hydrostatic CVT. Over 100,000 tractors have been produced with this transmission.

=== Power generation systems ===
CVTs have been used in aircraft electrical power generation systems since the 1950s.

CVTs with flywheels are used as a speed governor between an engine (e.g. a wind turbine) and the electric generator. When the engine is producing sufficient power, the generator is connected directly to the CVT which serves to regulate the engine&#x27;s speed. When the power output is too low, the generator is disconnected, and the energy is stored in the flywheel. It is only when the speed of the flywheel is sufficient that the kinetic energy is converted into electricity, intermittently, at the speed required by the generator.

=== Other uses ===
Some drill presses and milling machines contain a simple belt-drive CVT system to control the speed of the spindle, including the Jet models J-A5816 and J-A5818. In this system, the effective diameter of only the output shaft pulleys is continuously variable. The input pulley connected to the motor is usually fixed in diameter (or sometimes with discrete steps to allow a selection of speed ranges). The operator adjusts the speed of the drill by using a hand wheel that controls the width of the gap between the pulley halves. A tensioner pulley is implemented in the belt transmission to take up or release the slack in the belt as the speed is altered.

Winches and hoists are also an application of CVTs, especially for those adapting the transmission ratio to the resistant torque.

Bicycles with CVT gearing have had limited commercial success, with one example providing a range of gearing equivalent to an eight-speed shifter. The bicycle&#x27;s short gearing assisted when cycling uphill, but the CVT was noted to significantly increase the weight of the bicycle.

The rise of the electric bicycle has brought a reappraisal of the CVT as a better solution for an optimal drive train set up in comparison to gearing systems historically applied on human powered bicycles. The handsfree and continuously stepless operation combined with low maintenance make the CVT an appealing solution for the use on city eBikes and by commuters.

<doc id="609620" wikidata="Q336268" url="?curid=609620" title="Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford">
<text>Frederic John Napier Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford (12 August 1868 – 1 April 1933), styled the Lord Chelmsford until 1921, was a British statesman. He served as Governor of Queensland from 1905 to 1909, Governor of New South Wales from 1909 to 1913, and Viceroy of India from 1916 to 1921, where he was responsible for the creation of the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms. After serving a short time as First Lord of the Admiralty in the government of Ramsay MacDonald, he was appointed the Agent-General for New South Wales by the government of Jack Lang before his retirement.

==Early life==
Thesiger was born on 12 August 1868 in London, England, the son of the Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford and Adria Heath. He was educated at Winchester College and Magdalen College, Oxford, graduating from the latter as Bachelor of Arts with first-class honours in law in 1891. Thesiger was elected as a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford (1892–1899). In 1893 he was called to the Bar of the Inner Temple to practise law. He joined the army volunteer force as an officer in the 1st volunteer battalion in the Dorsetshire Regiment, and was promoted to captain on 13 September 1902.

A keen cricketer, he captained the Oxford XI and also played for Middlesex.

He was member of the London County Council between 1904 and 1905 and again as an alderman from 1913 and 1919.

==Governor of Queensland==

On 9 April 1905, he succeeded as 3rd Baron Chelmsford upon his father&#x27;s death and in July 1905 accepted his appointment as the Governor of Queensland in Australia. He arrived in Brisbane and was sworn in on 20 November. On 26 June 1906, Chelmsford was invested as a Knight Commander of Order of St Michael and St George. His term was dominated by conflict between the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly and the emergence of three evenly divided parties in the lower house.

Following the 1907 election, William Kidston, who had founded his own party, became Premier of Queensland with Labor support. The legislative council, then being an appointed chamber, then refused Kidston&#x27;s legislative programs on electoral reforms and wage-fixing. Kidston then made a request to Chelmsford to appoint enough members to the Council in order to get his legislation through. Chelmsford refused, on the grounds that he did not have a sufficient mandate from the people to make such demands. Kidston resigned in protest and Chelmsford commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Robert Philp, who formed a ministry, which was promptly defeated in the assembly. Chelmsford then granted Philp a dissolution, though the parliament was only six months old. Because Supply was denied by Kidston, Chelmsford stepped in and used the reserve powers to ensure that supply was passed until the election.

Kidston was returned to office in the 1908 election. The new assembly passed a motion criticising Chelmsford&#x27;s action and there was widespread speculation that he would be recalled. However, nothing came of this. Despite the admission that their representative had been mistaken in granting a dissolution, the Colonial Office and the British government remained in his favour. Chelmsford&#x27;s term expired just after Kidston resigned from the Labor Government and formed a coalition with Philp&#x27;s Conservatives.

==Governor of New South Wales==
In May 1909 Chelmsford accepted the appointment as Governor of New South Wales and was sworn in at Government House on 28 May 1909. Unlike in Queensland, his term was comparatively stable and was distinguished by good relations with the state government. At the start of his term, Charles Wade, of the Liberal Reform Party, was the Premier.

However, following the 1910 election, Wade&#x27;s Liberals were defeated and the Labor Party under James McGowen was sworn in as the state&#x27;s first Labor Government. Despite his conservative background, Chelmsford was able to get along well with the Labor Government. Chelmsford became friends with the Attorney General, William Holman, with whom they shared a love of music and as a competent Viola player, Chelmsford encouraged chamber concerts at Government House. He said of the government: &quot;I have never had a body of Ministers with whom it has been a greater pleasure to work. They are quiet, unassuming and industrious, and have won the goodwill and loyalty of their departments.&quot;

From 21 December 1909 to 27 January 1910 Chelmsford acted as Administrator of the Commonwealth when the Governor-General of Australia, The Earl of Dudley was on leave.

From April to November 1911, Chelmsford was back in England on overseas leave, thereby avoiding a major political crisis in New South Wales. In July 1911, two Labor Members of the Legislative Assembly resigned in protest over land reforms, thereby leaving McGowen&#x27;s government in a minority in the assembly. Holman, who had stepped in as acting-Premier following McGowen also taking leave (Both Chelmsford and McGowen were attending the coronation of King George V), asked the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, Sir William Cullen, to prorogue the Parliament until the by-elections were held.

Cullen declined on the basis that there was no need for him to act as the Government still had the confidence of the House and that the Governor had no discretion in the matter. Holman rejected this and, when Parliament resumed, resigned along with his Ministry and the Speaker. Holman further refused to advise Cullen to ask the Leader of the Opposition, Wade, to form a Government. Cullen did so nonetheless. Wade was wary, aware that if he accepted he too would be in a minority. Wade told Cullen that he would only accept if he was granted a dissolution. Cullen did not accept that condition and Wade refused to accept the commission. Cullen then had no choice but to recommission Holman and grant him a dissolution. Holman held onto Government tenuously as one seat was lost the by-elections. He therefore asked a member of the Opposition Liberals, Henry Willis, to take the Chair as Speaker. 

Despite the crisis having been averted, Chelmsford returned to face increasing problems over the balance of power in the appointed New South Wales Legislative Council. The council had only five Labor members in a total of 73 and as a result, 70% of house divisions were lost by the government in its first three years in office, despite a recognised need for cooperation. Chelmsford therefore approved 11 appointments in 1912, leaving Labor with only 13 members out of 59. McGowen was under pressure to ask for more appointments to move for the abolition of the council, but he had no such intention of doing so. In October 1912, Chelmsford announced his intention not to seek a further term as governor, which the Colonial Office reluctantly accepted, describing him as &quot;careful, hardworking and popular&quot;.

A Freemason, in 1910 he was elected the Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of NSW and held the position until 1913. In 1909 Freemason Lodge Chelmsford 261 was established in New South Wales in his honour. In 1912 he was invested as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George, becoming Chancellor of the Order from 1914 to 1916. His term expired and Chelmsford returned to England in March 1913.

==Viceroy of India==

Upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he rejoined his regiment and was posted to India. On 29 February 1916 he was appointed to the Privy Council (PC). Rising quickly, he was appointed Viceroy in March 1916, succeeding Lord Hardinge. As Viceroy he was invested as Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire and a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India in 1916 and was also Grand Master of the orders. He was invested as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 4 December 1917.

His time as Viceroy was marked by consistent calls for self-government from educated Indians, a demand which Chelmsford broadly agreed with. He convinced a preoccupied Foreign Office to send the Secretary of State for India, Edwin Samuel Montagu, to discuss the potential for reform. Together, they oversaw the implementation of the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, which gave greater authority to local Indian representative bodies. Trying to tread a fine line between reform and maintaining the British hold over India, Chelmsford passed repressive anti-terrorism laws to widespread opposition from Indian reformists. The laws sparked unrest in the Punjab, culminating in the implementation of martial law in the region and the Amritsar Massacre by General Reginald Dyer on 13 April 1919. Initially supportive of Dyer and slow to respond to the massacre, following a ruling condemning Dyer&#x27;s actions, Chelmsford eventually disciplined Dyer. This was however, seen by Indian Nationalists as too little, too late and the Indian National Congress boycotted the first regional elections in 1920. In addition to this, the Third Anglo-Afghan War broke out and Gandhi started his first campaign. On his return to Britain on 15 June 1921, he was elevated to Viscount as 1st Viscount Chelmsford of Chelmsford, County of Essex. He was often styled as Lord Chelmsford.

==Later life and legacy==

In 1924, despite being a lifelong Conservative, Chelmsford was persuaded to join the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald in 1924 as First Lord of the Admiralty, due to the fact that Labour had so few peers in the House of Lords. He never joined the party and only agreed on the condition that the Navy&#x27;s size be maintained and that he not be expected to attend any cabinet meetings of a political nature. He was duly sworn in by King George V on 23 January 1924 at Buckingham Palace. He was appointed as a Commissioner exercising the office of Lord High Admiral three times on 1 April, 15 August and 9 October 1924. Chelmsford was chairman of the Miners&#x27; Welfare Committee under the Mining Industry Act of 1920 and of the royal commission on mining subsidence in 1923–24. After the fall of the government in November 1924, he retired from political life.

In 1926 Chelmsford was appointed as Agent-General for New South Wales in London. The reasoning for this was that during state Attorney-General Edward McTiernan&#x27;s visit to London to put the Government&#x27;s case over its disputes with Governor Dudley de Chair&#x27;s opposition over the abolition of the Legislative Council the Government needed an influential representative in London and Labor Premier, Jack Lang, explained that &quot;it was absolutely necessary that the State should be represented by a gentleman who would be in close touch with the London financial market&quot;. He served until 1928.

He was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Law by Birmingham University in 1927, an honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law by Magdalen College, Oxford University in 1929 and as a Knight of Justice of the Order of St John of Jerusalem. As a fellow of All Souls, Chelmsford became Warden of the College in 1932.

He was a long-standing Freemason, and served as Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Queensland and the United Grand Lodge of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.

==Family==
Lord Chelmsford married Frances Charlotte Guest (22 March 1869 – 24 September 1957), daughter of Ivor Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, and Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill, on 27 July 1894 at St. George&#x27;s Church, Hanover Square. They had six children:

* Hon. Joan Frances Vere Thesiger (1 August 1895 – 15 May 1971), married Sir Alan Lascelles in 1920.
* Lt. Hon. Frederic Ivor Thesiger (17 October 1896 – 1 May 1917) of the 87th Brigade Royal Field Artillery, 
* Hon. Anne Molyneux Thesiger (17 December 1898 – 10 August 1973), married Donough O&#x27;Brien, 16th Baron Inchiquin in 1921.
* Hon. Bridget Mary Thesiger (7 August 1900 – 18 June 1983)
* Andrew Charles Gerald Thesiger, 2nd Viscount Chelmsford (25 July 1903 – 27 September 1970)
* Hon. Margaret St. Clair Sidney Thesiger (7 May 1911 – 1 July 1991)

Lady Chelmsford was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1917 and was also invested with the Imperial Order of the Crown of India.

Lord Chelmsford died of coronary vascular disease on 1 April 1933, aged 64. He was succeeded by his younger son (his eldest son having been killed in action in Mesopotamia in 1917) and survived by his four daughters. On his death the &quot;Brisbane Courier&quot; noted that &quot;the whole Empire suffers the loss of a man who, above all things, desired to be a true servant of the people.&quot;

He was the first cousin of the actor Ernest Thesiger. He was the uncle of the explorer Wilfred Thesiger (1910–2003). In the 1982 film &quot;Gandhi&quot;, the role of Chelmsford was played by Sir John Mills.

In their honour, the New South Wales government launched a new ferry, to be known as the &quot;Lady Chelmsford&quot; in 1910 as a Sydney Harbour Ferry. The &quot;Lady Chelmsford&quot; continued working the harbour until 1971 when she was sold. In Melbourne she operated as a cruising restaurant before being taken out of service and sold in 2005. Again becoming a restaurant, she sank at her moorings in February 2008 and after a protracted battle over insurance, the ship was deemed unsalvageable and broken up underwater in mid-2011.

<doc id="609632" wikidata="Q7324207" url="?curid=609632" title="Richard Bland">
<text>Richard Bland (May 6, 1710 – October 26, 1776), sometimes referred to as Richard Bland II or Richard Bland of Jordan&#x27;s Point, was an American Founding Father, planter, lawyer and politician from Virginia. A cousin and early mentor of Thomas Jefferson, Bland served 34 years in the Virginia General Assembly, and with John Robinson and this man&#x27;s cousin Peyton Randolph as one of the most influential and productive burgesses during the last quarter century of the colonial period.
In 1766, Bland wrote an influential pamphlet, &quot;An Inquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies&quot;, questioning the right of the British Parliament to impose taxes on colonists without their consent. He later served in the First Continental Congress where he signed the Continental Association, a trade embargo adopted in October 1774 in opposition to Parliament&#x27;s so-called Intolerable Acts. Bland retired from the Second Continental Congress due to his age in August 1775, two months after the creation of the Continental Army. However, he remained active in Virginia politics and helped draft a constitution for the newly-formed state in June 1776. Bland was named to Virginia&#x27;s House of Delegates when it was formed in October 1776, the same month as his death.

==Early life and education==

Born on May 6, 1710, to Elizabeth Randolph (1680–1720) (daughter of William Randolph), the second wife of prominent planter Richard Bland, he was born either at his father&#x27;s main plantation on the James River called &quot;Jordan&#x27;s Point&quot; or at the family&#x27;s &quot;Bland House&quot; in Williamsburg. Both his mother and father were of the First Families of Virginia, intermarrying and wielding economic, social and political power in the colony for generations. His namesake, Theodorick Bland of Westover, had immigrated to the Virginia colony in 1654 after the death of his older brother Edward Bland, in order to manage the family&#x27;s mercantile and shipping enterprises in Virginia. The eldest Theodorick established Berkeley Plantation and Westover Plantation on the James River, as well as the Bland house in Jamestown (the preceding colonial capitol), and served several terms in the House of Burgesses and was its speaker in 1660. He married Anna Bennett, the daughter of Virginia Governor Richard Bennett, who bore three sons: Theodorick Jr., Richard I (this man&#x27;s father), and John.

As his family&#x27;s second son in an age of primogeniture, Richard Bland I moved further upstream on the James River and started his own plantation, on land his father had purchased in 1656, and which became located in Prince George County, Virginia. Samuel Jordan had established a plantation there in 1620, calling it &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Bush,&quot; which later became better known as &quot;Jordan&#x27;s Journey.&quot; Richard Bland I had seven children by his first wife, Mary Swann (d.1700), the daughter of councillor Thomas Swann, but none survived their mother. His parents had married in 1702, and Elizabeth had borne two daughters before this boy&#x27;s birth, and would bear another daughter and son, Theodorick (b. 1718). His sisters all married burgesses: Mary Bland (b.1703) married Capt. Henry Lee I, Elizabeth Bland (b.1706) married William Beverley and Anna Bland (b.1711) married Robert Munford.

Both his parents died just before his tenth birthday in 1720. His mother died on January 22 and his father on April 6. His uncles, William and Richard Randolph, looked after his farm and early education and raised, as guardians, Richard and his siblings.

Bland became close friends with his first cousin, Peyton Randolph, that would last throughout their lives, often sitting side by side during their years of service in the House of Burgesses, the Committee of Safety, and the First and Second Continental Congresses. Another of Richard&#x27;s and Peyton&#x27;s first cousins, Jane Randolph Jefferson, had a son Thomas Jefferson who followed his cousins and mentors to the House of Burgesses and the Continental Congresses.

Richard attended the College of William &amp; Mary and, like many of his time, completed his education in Scotland at Edinburgh University. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1746, but never offered his legal services to the public.

==Planter==
Although Upon reaching legal age, Bland inherited his father&#x27;s Jordan Point plantation and other land. He farmed using enslaved labor. At his death, his estate included 30 slaves.

== Early political career ==

Bland served as a justice of the peace in Prince George County and was made a militia officer in 1739. In 1742, he was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he served successive terms until it was suppressed during the American Revolution. Bland&#x27;s thoughtful work made him one of its leaders, although he was not a strong speaker. He frequently served on committees whose role was to negotiate or frame laws and treaties. Sometimes described as a bookish scholar as well as farmer, Bland read law and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1746. He did not practice before the courts but collected legal documents and became known for his expertise in Virginia and British history and law.

Bland often published pamphlets (frequently anonymously), as well as letters. His first widely distributed public paper came as a result of the Parson&#x27;s Cause, which was a debate from 1759 to 1760 over the established church and the kind and rate of taxes used to pay the Anglican clergy. His pamphlet &quot;A Letter to the Clergy on the Two-penny Act&quot; was printed in 1760, as he opposed increasing pay and the creation of a bishop for the colonies.

An early critic of slavery, though a slaveholder, Bland stated &quot;under English government all men are born free&quot;, which prompted considerable debate with John Camm, a professor at Bland&#x27;s alma mater, the College of William &amp; Mary.

== Colonial rights advocate ==
When the Stamp Act created controversy throughout the colonies, Richard Bland thought through the entire issue of parliamentary laws as opposed to those that originated in the colonial assemblies. While others, particularly James Otis, get more credit for the idea of &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;, the full argument for this position seems to come from Bland. In early 1766, he wrote &quot;An Inquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies,&quot; which was published in Williamsburg and reprinted in England. Bland&#x27;s &quot;Inquiry&quot; examines the relationship of the king, parliament, and the colonies. While he concludes that the colonies were subject to the crown and that colonists should enjoy the rights of Englishmen, he questions the presumption that total authority and government came through parliament and its laws. Jefferson described the work as &quot;the first pamphlet on the nature of the connection with Great Britain which had any pretension to accuracy of view on that subject...There was more sound matter in his pamphlet than in the celebrated Farmer&#x27;s letters.&quot;

In September 1774, the Virginia Burgesses sent Bland to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Some of the views expressed in &quot;An Inquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies&quot; found their way into the first session of the Congress and were included in the Declaration of Rights.
Bland was elected to the Second Continental Congress, serving until August 12, 1775, when he declined another term because of his age.

==Founding the state of Virginia==
In 1775, as revolution neared in Virginia, the Virginia Convention replaced the Burgesses and the council as a form of ad-hoc government. That year he met with the Burgesses and with the three sessions of the convention. In March 1775, after Patrick Henry&#x27;s &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; speech, he was still opposed to taking up arms. He believed that reconciliation with England was still possible and desirable. Nevertheless, he was named to the committee of safety and re-elected as a delegate to the national Congress. In May, he travelled to Philadelphia for the opening of the Second Continental Congress, but soon returned home, withdrawing because of the poor health and failing eyesight of old age. However, his radicalism had increased, and by the convention&#x27;s meeting in July, he proposed hanging Lord Dunmore, the royal governor.

In the first state convention meeting of 1776, Richard Bland declined a re-election to the Third Continental Congress, citing his age and health. However, he played an active role in the remaining conventions. He served on the committee which drafted Virginia&#x27;s first constitution in 1776. When the House of Delegates for the new state government was elected, he was one of the members.

==Personal life==
Bland married three times, and survived all his wives. His first wife, Anne Poythress (December 13, 1712 – April 9, 1758), was the daughter of Colonel Peter and Ann Poythress, from Henrico County, Virginia. The couple married at Jordan&#x27;s Point on March 21, 1729, and she bore six sons and six daughters before her death in 1758:
* Richard Bland (b. 20 February 1731)
* Elizabeth Bland (b. 17 March 1733)
* Ann Bland (b. 15 August 1735)
* Peter Bland (b. 2 February 1737, d.16 February 1781)
* John Bland (b. 19 October 1739)
* Mary Bland (b. 15 January 1741)
* William Bland (b. 26 December 1742)
* Theodorick Bland (b. 28 September 1744)
* Edward Bland (b. 16 December 1746)
* Sarah Bland (b. 19 September 1750)
* Susan Bland (b. 20 February 1752)
* Lucy Bland (b. 22 September 1754).

On January 1, 1759, the widower Bland married the widow Martha Macon Massie, who died eight months after their marriage. In 1760 he married for a third time to Elizabeth Blair Bolling, widow of John Bolling and sister of councilor John Blair. She died late in April 1775, and like Martha Massie Boling, bore no children during her marriage to Richard Bland.

== Death and legacy ==
Bland collapsed on a Williamsburg street on October 26, 1776, and died later that evening at the house of John Tazewell. On November 7, he was buried in the family cemetery at Jordan&#x27;s Point in Prince George County. Bland owned an extensive library for his time, much of which was acquired after his death by Jefferson and his nephew-in-law St. George Tucker, and made its way to the Library of Congress as part of Jefferson&#x27;s personal library donation in 1815.

Virginia&#x27;s Bland County and Richard Bland College, the junior college of the College of William &amp; Mary, are named in his honor.

<doc id="609636" wikidata="Q900828" url="?curid=609636" title="Chemung River">
<text>The Chemung River ( ) is a tributary of the Susquehanna River, approximately long, in south central New York and northern Pennsylvania in the United States. It drains a mountainous region of the northern Allegheny Plateau in the Southern Tier of New York. The valley of the river has long been an important manufacturing center in the region but has suffered a decline in the late 20th century.

==Description==

The Chemung River is formed near Painted Post in Steuben County, just west of Corning by the confluence of the Tioga River and Cohocton rivers. It flows generally east-southeast through Corning, Big Flats, Elmira, and Waverly. It crosses into northern Pennsylvania before joining the Susquehanna River approximately south of Sayre.

The name of the river comes from a Lenape word meaning &quot;at the horn&quot; composed of the root &quot;chemu&quot; &#x27;horn&#x27; and the suffix &quot;-ng&quot; meaning &#x27;at/on&#x27;. Another possible etymology is &quot;big horn&quot;, possibly dating from the discovery of large mammoth tusks in the river bed.

Most of the valley is cut into Devonian age shale, sandstone, and limestone. The hilltops are rounded by glaciation. The tributaries, particularly the Cohocton River, have captured some of the former Genesee River drainage, due to terminal moraines that filled some valley areas and diverted streams.

New York State Route 17 / Interstate 86 follows the valley of the river for much of its course.

==History==

The area near the river&#x27;s source was referred to as &quot;Concanoga&quot;, or the land of three rivers, by the Seneca who lived in the area. In colonial times the river valley was a major trade route through the hill country of western New York, first for the Iroquois and other Native Americans, and later for the European settlers.

In 1779 during the Revolutionary War, American troops of the Sullivan Expedition defeated a combined force of Iroquois, Tories and British at the Battle of Newtown along the river southeast of Elmira. The victory opened the way for Sullivan to systematically destroy Iroquois villages and settlements throughout their homeland of central and western New York.

The construction of the Chemung Canal which was completed in 1833 between the Chemung and the southern end of Seneca Lake allowed the shipment of Pennsylvania anthracite coal, lumber and agricultural products to the Erie Canal system, leading to the growth of Elmira as a regional center of manufacturing. The canals were rendered obsolete by the coming of the railroads in the late 1840s and 1850s. The community of Corning is renowned as the site of Corning Incorporated, formerly the Corning Glassworks.

In the later 20th century the valley, along with the rest of the Rust Belt, suffered economic decline with industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs to other regions and countries, and changes in the economy. Although the river is no longer used for regular transportation, it has become a popular destination for recreational canoeing and fly fishing, in particular for smallmouth and largemouth bass, trout, rock bass, sunfish, bluegill, and carp.

===Floods===

The river has had periodic heavy flooding throughout its recorded history. In June 1972 the remnants of Hurricane Agnes stalled over the New York-Pennsylvania border, dropping up to of rain into the Chemung Valley, which was among the areas worst hit by the resultant flooding. The flooding left widespread areas of the communities of Corning, Big Flats, and Elmira under water and destroyed many bridges.

Elmira lost three of the four downtown road bridges that existed at the time (Madison, Main and Walnut streets) as well as the Erie Railroad bridge. The Lake Street bridge was the only bridge not damaged by the flood and was reopened to traffic. Since it was the only bridge, a &quot;Red Ball Express&quot; was created that allowed only one lane of traffic in each direction across the bridge. This created a traffic nightmare that was relieved when temporary repairs were done on the Madison Avenue bridge, which allowed it to be reopened to traffic. Lake Street bridge was made southbound only, and Madison Avenue bridge was made northbound only.

Upstream, Fitch&#x27;s Bridge in West Elmira was washed out. Downstream, the Lowman Crossover and White Wagon bridges were washed out. The White Wagon bridge, near what is now the Wilawana exit of the Southern Tier Expressway, was never rebuilt, leaving Chemung County Route 56 split into two sections and resulting in the creation of the aforementioned Wilawana exit, to allow traffic to access the now cut-off portion of CR-56.

<doc id="609644" wikidata="Q5112370" url="?curid=609644" title="Christopher Furness, 1st Baron Furness">
<text>Christopher Furness, 1st Baron Furness (23 April 1852 – 10 November 1912) was a British businessman and Liberal Party politician.

==Early life==
Furness was born in West Hartlepool, Durham on 23 April 1852. He was the seventh son of John Furness of West Hartlepool, and Averill Eastor Furness (née Wilson).

==Career==
He started his career as a buyer in Thomas Furness and Company, wholesale provision merchants, a firm owned by his older brother Thomas, and became a partner two years later. Stock for the business had to be brought in by ship, and Christopher found that it would be cheaper to use their own vessels, rather than hire other peoples. Consequently, on his initiative, the firm bought several steam ships from local shipbuilder William Gray &amp; Company in 1877.

In 1882, Christopher Furness and Company was formed and the business was split into two. Thomas kept the provision merchants, while Christopher took charge of the shipping fleet. After seven years as a partner in the shipbuilding firm of Edward Withy and Company, Furness merged it with his own company in 1891, to form Furness, Withy and Company, which was run by his nephew, Sir Stephen Furness, 1st Baronet after his death. By a series of mergers, his firms become the main employers in Hartlepool, until they finally closed in the 1980s.

In 1901, he sold a ship that he had ordered, &quot;Huronian&quot;, before it sailed. It was reported missing, later lost, early in 1902, on its maiden voyage to Canada. It was deemed to have sunk with the loss of all those aboard. In 1907 a letter in a bottle apparently sent from the ship washed up in Ireland.

Furness was one of the first people to own a turbine-powered steam yacht. Alexander Stephen and Sons of Linthouse, Glasgow launched in October 1902 and completed her in April 1903. Furness owned her until he died in 1912.

===Political career===
Furness was also involved in politics, and was elected Member of Parliament for The Hartlepools at a by-election in 1891. He lost the seat in 1895, but was re-elected in 1900, and served until his re-election in January 1910 was declared void after an electoral petition.

He was appointed a knight bachelor in the 1895 Birthday Honours, and in 1910 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Furness, of Grantley in the West Riding of the County of Yorkshire. 

In 1909 he was made an Honorary Freeman of West Hartlepool.

==Personal life==
On 16 May 1876, Furness married Jane Annette Suggitt (1855–1930), the only daughter of Henry Suggitt of Brierton, county Durham. They had one son:

* Marmaduke Furness (1883–1940), who in 1918 was created Viscount Furness.

Christopher Furness died on 10 November 1912, aged 60. He was succeeded in the barony by his son Marmaduke.

The nearby settlement of Sallatunturi is home to the Salla Ski Resort.

==History==

Salla is in the Eastern Lapland and as a border area was affected by the Second World War. Red Army troops invaded Finland at Salla during the Winter War but were stopped by the Finnish Army (see Battle of Salla). Parts of the municipality were ceded to the Soviet Union after the war. The ceded part is sometimes called &quot;Old Salla&quot; or &quot;Vanha Salla&quot;. During the Continuation War the old town of Salla was on the Soviet side of the border. The German XXXVI Corps attacked the Soviet positions in an operation code-named &quot;Polarfuchs&quot;. With the help of the Finnish 6th Division it managed to occupy all of the ceded territories. At the end of the war the German troops were pushed out of Lapland by Finnish troops in the Lapland War.

The following villages were ceded to the Soviet Union: Alakurtti, Korja (Korya), Kuolajärvi (Kuoloyarvi), Lampela, Sallansuu, Yläkurtti (Yulyakurtti), Sovajärvi (Sovayarvi), Tuutijärvi (Tuutiyarvi) and Vuorijärvi (Vuoriyarvi).

In January 2021, the mayor of Salla, Erkki Parkkinen, launched a bid to host the 2032 Summer Olympic Games to raise awareness of climate change and highlight the threat the climate crisis poses to Salla and its ecosystem, which is dependent on low temperatures for most of the year.

==Transportation==

Salla is the terminus of a freight-only railway line from Kemijärvi. In 2006, the Finnish Rail Administration announced proposals to close the line. The railway formerly extended beyond Salla into Russia, but has never carried international traffic.

== Geography ==
Neighbour municipalities are Kemijärvi, Kuusamo, Pelkosenniemi, Posio and Savukoski.

===Climate===
Salla has a subarctic climate (Dfc). Summer days are mild with about 1/3 of all days experiencing precipitation with nights tending to be cool. Winters are very long, cold, snowy, and extremely cloudy, lasting from the beginning of October through April, with mid-winter thaws being rare, and cold snaps relatively common. Spring and Autumn tend to be cool, not very variable, and short, lasting only a couple weeks to a few weeks in length.

The low temperature record of Salla is -50 °C (-58 °F), which was recorded in Naruska in 1985. It was also the record of Finland until 1999. On 28 January 1999, the unofficial record of Finland, -54,3 °C (-65,7 °F), was recorded in Naruska.

====Note====

<text>Gudalur Narayanaswamy Balasubramaniam (6 January 1910 – 1 May 1965), popularly known as GNB, was an Indian Carnatic singer. He innovated the art through emphasis on &quot;laya &quot;control and reducing the &quot;gamakas&quot; which eventually made Carnatic music appeal to the lay and the learned alike. He was also a Tamil film actor. Ariyakudi Iyengar inspired him.

He was born in Gudalur, a small village in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu (then called the Madras Presidency), which is close to Mayavaram. He was the son of G V Narayanaswamy Iyer, who was a music student. Throughout his younger years, he closely observed the techniques of the musicians of his day. Ariyakudi Ramanuja Iyengar became his manasika guru and inspiration. While his father hoped that GNB would become a successful lawyer, he was intent on pursuing his musical ambitions. He completed his BA (Hons) in English Literature at the Christian College, Chennai, and took up a short music course at Annamalai University. under the guidance of T S Sabesa Iyer, but discontinued due to ill health. However, he joined the diploma course in music at Madras University in the first batch and Tiger Varadhachariar was the principal. Within 2 years, he was ready for concert performances. He gave his first concert in 1928.

==Career==
He acted in films, including &quot;Bama Vijayam&quot; (1934), Sathi Anusuya (1937), &quot;Sakuntalai&quot; (1940), Udayanan Vasavadatta (1947) (with Vasundhara Devi, mother of Vijayanthimala) and Rukmangadhan (1947). In &quot;Sakunthalai&quot;, he appeared as Dushyantha, alongside the vocalist M.S. Subbulakshmi. M.S. Subbulakshmi was fascinated by his music and embraced his style completely in her early years as mentioned in the book &quot;M S - A Life in Music&quot; by TJS George. After a short stint in the film industry, GNB returned to the Carnatic music fraternity, until his passing in 1965.

GNB was known for brigha-laden and brisk music, and emerged as one of the most prominent Carnatic musicians of the era, drawing hundreds of people to each concert. He was famous for his renderings of &quot;Vathapi Ganapathim&quot; by Mutthuswamy Dikshitar and &quot;Vinayaka Ninnu vina&quot; by E. V. Ramakrishna Bhagavathar, both in the ragam Hamsadhwani. It was after hearing his rapid rendition of Vathapi that his father placed him under formal music training. He also frequently sang songs in the ragam Panthuvarali, such as &quot;Paripalaya Sarasiruha&quot; and &quot;Siva Siva Siva&quot;, composed by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal and Tyagaraja Swami respectively. After singing either a long main piece or a Ragam Tanam Pallavi, famous ones being &quot;Unadarishanam Kidai Kimo&quot; in Kalyani and &quot;Tilai Eesanai Ka&quot; in Kambhoji, he would finish the concert with his popular bhajans and thukuddas, most notably &quot;Dikku Teriyadha Kaatil&quot; by Subramanya Bharati, &quot;Radha Mukha Kamala&quot; in the ragam Hindustani Kapi by Sri Papanasam Sivan, and &quot;Radha Sametha Krishna&quot; in the raga Misra Yaman.

Sri GNB also released many records over his career, most notably the krithi &quot;Vasudevayani&quot; in the ragam Kalyani by Saint Tyagaraja, which reportedly earned him Rs 10,000, or around ₹818,153.88 in the present day. Other songs he was famous for include &quot;Brochevarevarura&quot; in Kamas by Mysore Vasudevachariar, &quot;Marukelara O Raghava&quot; in the ragam Jayanthasri by Saint Tyagaraja, &quot;Maragathavallim Manasa&quot; in Kamboji by Mutthuswamy Dikshitar, &quot;Swaminatha Paripalaya&quot; in Nattai by Mutthuswamy Dikshitar, &quot;Ragasudha rasa&quot; in Andholika by Saint Tyagaraja, and others.

He composed over 250 krithis, most in Telugu with a few in Sanskrit and Tamil. GNB also invented new ragas. He taught a number of students during his active years. Most famous among them are M. L. Vasanthakumari, Radha-Jayalakshmi duo, Tanjore S. Kalyanaraman, Trichur V. Ramachandran, T. R. Balu, T. S. Balasubramanian, and Ragini.

==Administrative role==
GNB worked as the Deputy Chief Producer of Carnatic Music, in A.I.R Chennai for a number of years alongside Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer who was the Chief Producer for Carnatic Music, and Dr. M. Balamuralikrishna who was the Producer for Light Music. GNB joined the Swathi Thirunal College of Music, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala as Principal in March 1964.

==Personal life==
He described the world of music as a perilous jungle and discouraged his sons and daughters from learning it. 
His health deteriorated and worsened after a major stroke in the late 1950s. He died on 1 May 1965, aged 55.

In 2022, it was announced that Lopez is involved in an effort to revive the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo, as he oversaw auditions that took place, in a project named &quot;Menudo: A New Beginning&quot;. Lopez helped revive the band as their new manager, and in 2023, Menudo released their first single under Lopez, named &quot;Mi Amore&quot;.

==Personal life==
According to Lopez, Fergie was his first kiss and the two were involved briefly while they were both on the show &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;.

In 1993, Lopez was accused of date rape, but prosecutors found no evidence to support the allegation, and multiple witnesses &quot;contradicted the woman&#x27;s account of her encounter&quot; with Lopez.

After six years of dating, Lopez married actress Ali Landry on April 24, 2004, in a Catholic ceremony at the Las Alamandas resort outside Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, but their marriage was annulled two weeks later. In a 2011 interview, Lopez admitted that the parting transpired after Landry discovered Lopez was unfaithful to her days before the wedding at his bachelor party. Lopez dated professional dancer Karina Smirnoff, his &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; partner, from 2006 to June 2008.

In the fall of 2008, Lopez met Broadway dancer, actress, and producer Courtney Mazza on &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; on Broadway in New York. They married in Punta Mita, Mexico, on December 1, 2012. They have a daughter Gia (b. 2010) and two sons Santiago &amp; Dominic (b. 2013 and 2019).

Lopez has stated that he is Catholic and goes to church every week. In March 2018, he underwent baptism by immersion at the Jordan River, which was administered by a Catholic priest.

He is a proponent of health and fitness, and was the cover feature for the November 2013 issue of &quot;FitnessRX For Men&quot; magazine. To complement his fitness regime, Lopez is an amateur boxer and a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu; he began training in early 2017 and received his blue belt in February 2018 under Professor Robert Hill of Gracie Barra Glendale. He received his purple belt in November 2022.

<text>Robert Arthur Peel (May 6, 1909 – January 8, 1992) was a Christian Science historian and writer on religious and ecumenical topics. A Christian Scientist for over 70 years, Peel wrote editorials for the Christian Science Monitor, a publication owned by the Church of Christ, Scientist. He was also a counsellor for the church&#x27;s Committee on Publication, set up by Mary Baker Eddy (1821–1910), the religion&#x27;s founder, to protect her own and the church&#x27;s reputation.

Peel is best known for his three-volume biography, &quot;Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery&quot; (1966), &quot;Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Trial&quot; (1971), and &quot;Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Authority&quot; (1977).

== Early life and education ==
Born in London to Anne Susannah Monk, a Christian Scientist, and Arthur James Peel, Peel moved to Boston with his parents and sister, Doris (1907–1990), in or around 1921. He was educated at the Boston Latin School and from 1927 studied English literature at Harvard University, graduating in 1931. His undergraduate honors thesis, &quot;The Creed of a Victorian Pagan&quot;, a study of English novelist and poet George Meredith, was published by the university that year. According to the British journalist Frederic Newlands Hunter, T. S. Eliot, who taught at Harvard, published Peel&#x27;s undergraduate essay on Virginia Woolf in &quot;The Criterion&quot;, a British literary magazine. After graduating, Peel taught history and literature at Harvard and began his graduate studies. In 1935 he submitted a proposal for a doctorate on Mary Baker Eddy, but it was rejected. He was awarded a master&#x27;s degree in 1940.

== Career ==
After several years teaching at Harvard, Peel taught English and philosophy at Principia College, a Christian Science college in Elsah, Illinois, returning to Harvard in 1940 for his master&#x27;s, then resuming his teaching at Principia. During World War II, he served in the South Pacific as a counter-intelligence officer for the US Army. In 1945, according to Hunter, he joined the staff of General Douglas MacArthur, who oversaw the occupation of Japan after the war; Peel taught Shigeko Higashikuni (Princess Teru), daughter of Emperor Hirohito, and her husband, Prince Morihiro Higashikuni.

After the war, Peel joined the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, a newspaper owned by the Christian Science church, writing editorials and book reviews, then in 1953 left the &quot;Monitor&quot; to work for The First Church of Christ, Scientist, the church&#x27;s administration in Boston, where he became an advisor to the church&#x27;s Committee on Publication. That year, he recorded a radio talk about Christian Science, &quot;Moving Mountains&quot;, for the BBC Third Programme. First published in the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, it also appeared in the BBC magazine &quot;The Listener&quot;. In the article, he argued for the Christian Science view of humanity as &quot;spiritual rather than material, incapable of corruption and error, no more subject to annihilation than his Maker&quot;.

His first book, &quot;Christian Science: Its Encounter with American Culture&quot;, was published in 1958. His extensive research into the life of Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian Science church, culminated in his biographical trilogy, &quot;Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery&quot; (1966), &quot;Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Trial&quot; (1971), and &quot;Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Authority&quot; (1977), first published by Holt, Rinehart and Winston, then by the Christian Science Publishing Society. Peel was a Christian Scientist all his adult life, although he was said to have become estranged from the church in later years.

==Reception==
Theologian Cornelius J. Dyck described Peel&#x27;s approach in &quot;Christian Science: Its Encounter with American Culture&quot; (1958) as &quot;partisan but gentle, the intention is apologetic but without either alienating the reader or making a wild-eyed convert out of him&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Discovery&quot;, Charles S. Braden wrote in 1967: &quot;Despite the impressive apparatus of scholarship employed, Mr. Peel&#x27;s book must be taken for what it really is, an exceedingly clever piece of propaganda in support of the official view of the life of Mrs. Eddy. As such it is probably the most effective that has yet appeared.&quot; According to historian James Findlay, Peel was &quot;highly sympathetic&quot; to Eddy; the result was a &quot;flat, one or two-dimensional image that remains unreal&quot;. Despite this, Findlay viewed &quot;The Years of Discovery&quot; as a &quot;substantial addition to the literature on American religious history&quot;.

In the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; in 1978, Martin E. Marty wrote that Peel&#x27;s work had &quot;begun to break the barriers between apologists and critics&quot;. Raymond J. Cunningham, a history professor, described Peel the following year as a &quot;painstaking and imaginative scholar&quot; and the final book of Peel&#x27;s trilogy a more balanced picture of Eddy, but noted his &quot;uncomfortably reverential&quot; approach and special pleading to resolve &quot;doubtful points in favor of the subject&quot;. Cunningham concluded nevertheless that the work was an important achievement. Biographer Carol Dickson noted that &quot;Peel seeks to ignore controversies completely by confining discussions of conflicting evidence and questions of reliability to his notes.&quot;

In her own biography of Mary Baker Eddy in 1998, Gillian Gill called Peel &quot;Mrs. Eddy&#x27;s most brilliant, informed, and judicious biographer.&quot; &quot;Throughout the biography his love, sympathy, and reverence for his subject shine through,&quot; she wrote. &quot;But Peel was also dedicated to historical truth and serious scholarship, and his text is supplemented by references, quotations, and copious notes which form a treasure trove for scholars.&quot; Another benefit of the work, she added, was that it supplied archival numbers for material scholars had not known existed. Caroline Fraser wrote in 1999 that Peel was &quot;an apologist for Eddy&#x27;s more eccentric characteristics.&quot; In 2003, William E. Phipps, a professor of religion and philosophy, also described him as an &quot;Eddy apologist&quot;.

<text>The Lincoln Continental is a series of mid-sized and full-sized luxury cars produced between 1939 and 2020 by Lincoln, a division of the American automaker Ford Motor Company. The model line was introduced following the construction of a personal vehicle for Edsel Ford, who commissioned a coachbuilt 1939 Lincoln-Zephyr convertible, developed as a vacation vehicle to attract potential Lincoln buyers. In what would give the model line its name, the exterior was designed with European &quot;continental&quot; styling elements, including a rear-mounted spare tire.

In production for over 55 years across nine different decades, Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental. Within the Lincoln model line, the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base-trim sedan. From 1961 to 1976, Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line. The model line has also gone on hiatus three times. From 1949 to 1955, the nameplate was briefly retired. In 1981, the Continental was renamed the Lincoln Town Car to accommodate the 1982 seventh-generation Continental. After 2002, the Continental was retired, largely replaced by the Lincoln MKS in 2009; in 2017, the tenth-generation Continental replaced the MKS.

As part of its entry into full-scale production, the first-generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment, the personal luxury car. Following World War II, the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than sports cars and grand touring cars with an emphasis on features, styling, and comfort over performance and handling. From 1956 to 1957, the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short-lived Continental Division, marketing the 1956–1957 Continental Mark II as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company; as a second successor, Ford introduced the Continental Mark series in 1969, produced over six generations to 1998.

Along with the creation of the personal luxury car segment, the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history. The Continental is the final American vehicle line with a factory-produced V12 engine (1948), the final four-door convertible (1967), and the final model line to undergo downsizing (for the 1980 model year).

American production of the Continental and MKZ, its only two sedans, ended in 2020 thereby making Lincoln a crossover/SUV-only brand in the USA. After it was discontinued in Lincoln&#x27;s home market, Ford indicated that it planned to move Continental production to China.

==Edsel Ford prototype (1939)==

=== Development ===
The Lincoln Continental was first produced as a personal vehicle for Ford Motor Company President Edsel Ford. In 1938, Ford commissioned a one-off design he wanted ready for his March 1939 vacation from company Chief Stylist Eugene T. &quot;Bob&quot; Gregorie. Using the blueprints of the streamlined Lincoln-Zephyr as a starting point, Gregorie sketched a design for a convertible with a redesigned body; allegedly, the initial sketch for the design was completed in an hour.

Ford wanted to revive the popularity of the 1929–1932 Lincoln Victoria coupe and convertible but with a more modern approach, reflecting European styling influences for the Continental.

By design, the Edsel Ford prototype was essentially a channeled and sectioned Lincoln-Zephyr convertible; although the vehicle wore a conventional windshield profile, the prototype sat nearly 7 inches lower than a standard Lincoln. Along with the massive decrease in height, the running boards were deleted entirely. In contrast to the Zephyr (and in a massive change from the K-Series Lincoln), the hood sat nearly level with the fenders taking advantage of the fact that the engine type and configuration did not need the clearance afforded by the height of the standard Lincoln hood line.

To focus on the styling of the car, the chrome trim on the car was largely restricted to the grille; the prototype differed from the eventual production version in that it utilized a somewhat less angular roof line. As with the Lincoln-Zephyr, the prototype utilized a 267 cubic-inch V12 engine, transverse leaf springs front and rear as well as hydraulic drum brakes.

The prototype designed by Gregorie was produced on time, making the deadline to be delivered to Edsel Ford in Florida. Interest from well-off friends was high; Edsel sent a telegram back to Michigan that he could sell a thousand of them. In reference to its European-inspired design, the Lincoln-based prototype received its name: Continental.

Immediately, production commenced on the Lincoln Continental, with the majority of production being &quot;Cabriolet&quot; convertibles and a rare number of coupes. These were extensively hand-built; the two dozen 1939 models and 400 1940-built examples were built with hand-hammered body panels; dies for machine-pressing were not constructed until 1941. The limited number of 1939 models produced are commonly referred to as &#x27;1940 Continentals&#x27;.

=== Legacy and significance ===

The modified body gave the Continental new proportions over its Zephyr counterpart; with the hoodline sitting lower over the V12 engine and the passenger compartment moved rearward, the prototype had more in common with classic era &quot;long-hood, short deck&quot; body configurations versus being a strict adherent of contemporary streamline moderne design trends. This design philosophy quickly became the standard for American vehicles for decades.

As a consequence of the smaller trunk space, the spare tire was mounted behind the trunk; while disappearing on American cars, the externally mounted, covered spare tire remained a feature on European-produced cars. Though the spare tire itself was relocated into the vehicle for all succeeding models, the styling motif remained a hallmark of most Continental Mark Series cars. With the exception of the 1958–1960 Continental Mark III, IV and V, all generations of the Mark Series featured a rounded trunk bulge that suggested the appearance of an externally rear-mounted spare tire.

Aftermarket kits that relocate the spare tire behind the trunk, popular on Fifties cars even today, remain known as Continental kits due to the design&#x27;s continued association with the famous Continental model line.

==First generation (1940–1942, 1946–1948)==


Lincoln Continentals from 1939 to 1941 shared largely the same body design with each other with push-button door catch releases displacing the previous lever type handles for 1941; the Continental received minimal updates from year to year.

For the 1942 model year, all Lincoln models were given squared-up fenders, and a revised grille, with the Lincoln-Zephyr now gaining exterior push-button door catch releases. The result was a boxier, more massive appearance in keeping with then-current design trends, but perhaps less graceful in retrospect. 1942 production was shortened, following the entry of the United States into World War II; the attack on Pearl Harbor led to the suspension of production of automobiles for civilian use.

After World War II, the Lincoln division of Ford returned the Continental to production as a 1946 model; Lincoln dropped the Zephyr nomenclature following the war, so the postwar Continental was derived from the standard Lincoln (internally H-Series). To attract buyers, the design was refreshed with updated trim, distinguished by a new grille. For 1947, walnut wood trim was added to the interior.

Following the death of Edsel Ford in 1943, Ford Motor Company re-organized its corporate management structure, which led to the 1946 departure of the Continental&#x27;s designer Bob Gregorie. 1948 would become the last year for the Continental, as the division sought to redevelop its new 1949 model line as an upgraded version of the Mercury; the expensive personal-luxury car no longer had a role at Lincoln.

The 1939–1948 Continental is recognized as a &quot;Full Classic&quot; by the Classic Car Club of America, one of the last-built cars to be so recognized. As of 2015, the 1948 Lincoln Continental and 1948 Lincoln were the last cars produced and sold by a major U.S. automaker with a V12 engine. Base retail price for the coupe was listed at US$2,727 () and the cabriolet was listed at US$2,778 ().


==Second generation (1956–1957)==
After an eight-year hiatus, for the 1956 model year, the Continental nameplate made its return; to launch the vehicle, Ford created a namesake &quot;Continental&quot; division centered around its new flagship vehicle. To again highlight the European influence of the original Continental, Ford assigned the Mark II suffix to the new Continental (also in an effort to distinguish itself from the similar Bentley Continental). Slotted well above Lincoln-Mercury, Continentals would be marketed and serviced through the Lincoln dealership network.

At its 1956 launch, the Continental Mark II was the most expensive automobile sold by a domestic manufacturer in the United States, rivaling the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud. At $10,000 ($ in dollars ) the Mark II cost nearly the same as five Ford Customlines. With a large number of power-equipment features included, the Mark II was offered with only a single option: air conditioning, priced at $595.

On a unique, low-slung chassis sharing only its 126-inch wheelbase dimension with the Lincoln Capri and Premiere, the Mark II was assembled with its own body panels and interior; each vehicle was hand-built, with hand-sanding and finishing of body panels. In several elements of its design the Mark II broke from American styling precedent. As with a Rolls-Royce or Mercedes-Benz 300d, the Mark II essentially restricted chrome trim to the window trim, grille, and bumpers. With a nearly flat hood and trunklid, the Mark II was also designed with neither tailfins (then prominent on American sedans) nor pontoon fenders (then current in Europe). Rather than a separate assemblage, the &quot;Continental spare tire&quot; was now integrated into the deck lid stamping, serving to accommodate the vertically mounted spare tire beneath.

In total, 2,996 Continental Mark IIs were produced including two prototype convertibles. As a consequence of the nearly hand-built construction, Ford estimated it lost nearly $1000 on every Continental Mark II produced. After 1957, the Mark II was discontinued; the Continental Division was re-branded as a competitor to Imperial and Cadillac rather than Rolls-Royce and Bentley.

==Third generation (1958–1960)==

To build a better business case for its flagship and the division that marketed the vehicle, the Continental model line underwent extensive changes for the 1958 model year. To widen its sales potential, Ford required Continental to reach a $6,000 price point ($ in dollars ) (a 40% reduction from the Mark II), allowing the division to better compete against Cadillac Eldorado and Imperial LeBaron. To allow for production at a larger scale, the Continental model line was more closely integrated with Lincoln, differing primarily in roofline, trim, and grille. For 1959, Ford cancelled the Continental division outright, with its model line remaining through the 1960 model year as part of the model cycle.

The first all-new unibody design since World War II, this generation of the Continental is one of the largest sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company (or any American automaker).

===Development===
To facilitate continuation of the Continental model line, the division was forced to abandon hand-built construction. Sharing a common chassis and much of the exterior of the Lincoln Premiere, Continental production shifted to the then-new Wixom Assembly plant.

To set itself apart from a Lincoln, along with a division-specific grille, all versions of the Continental (including convertibles) were styled with a reverse-slant roofline, fitted with a retractable &quot;breezeway&quot; rear window. First introduced on the 1957 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, the feature allowed for augmented interior ventilation (along with air conditioning). Unlike the Turnpike Cruiser, the reverse slant of the roofline included the rear window, an element that would reappear on Mercury sedans in the next decade.

The Continental Mark III was designed by John Najjar, Chief Stylist of Lincoln, assisted by Elwood Engel largely drawing influence from the 1955 Ford La Tosca concept model designed by Alex Tremulis. Engel would style the 1959 Mark IV, with Don Delarossa (who replaced Najjar as Lincoln Chief Stylist in 1957) developing the 1960 Mark V. As a result of its massive size and the configuration of its headlights, the model line was nicknamed the &quot;slant-eyed monster&quot; in the Ford design studio.

===Chassis/body===
The 1958–1960 Continental Mark III–V are built upon the same mechanical components used by the Lincoln Capri and Premiere. For 1958, Lincoln split further from Mercury in body design as part of ongoing efforts to outdo Cadillac, with Lincoln adopting unibody construction for the first time; the Continental shared a common body with the Premiere with the exception of the reverse-slant roofline.

Shared with Lincoln, Mercury, and the Ford Thunderbird, the Continental Mark III–V were fitted with a 430 cubic-inch MEL V8 engine; a 3-speed Turbo-Drive automatic was the sole transmission. In 1958, the engine produced 375 hp, and was detuned to 350 hp in 1959, making 315 hp in 1960.

Using a 131-inch wheelbase, the 1958 Continentals are the longest-wheelbase sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company. Longer than a Ford Excursion, the 1958–1960 Continentals are the longest sedans ever produced by Ford without 5-mph bumpers. The 1958 Continental Mark III convertible is the longest convertible ever mass-produced in the United States, with the sole exception of the rare 1934–1937 Cadillac V16 convertibles.

===Models===
In line with the previous Continental naming tradition, Continental introduced its 1958 model line as the Mark III. In a break from previous practice, the two subsequent model years were marketed as incrementally increased &quot;marks&quot; (Marks IV and V).

====Mark III (1958)====
For 1958, Continental released the Mark III in four body styles, including a 2-door hardtop and convertible, a 4-door pillared sedan, and a four-door hardtop sedan called Landau. Although far less expensive than the Mark II, the Mark III remained well-equipped, retaining air conditioning as an option which was relocated from the ceiling to the dashboard. The Mark III became the first Ford Motor Company vehicle to offer an FM radio tuner; it was a rarely ordered option. A unique option was &quot;Auto Lube&quot;, allowing for the car to lubricate itself as long as an oil reservoir was kept full.

====Mark IV (1959)====
For 1959, the Continental Mark IV saw a minor restyling, with the elimination of Dagmars from the front bumpers and side sculpting becoming much less deeply drawn. Coinciding with the end of the Continental Division, &quot;Continental III&quot; fender badging is replaced by separate &quot;Continental&quot; and &quot;Mark IV&quot; badging. The grille is restyled slightly, with the headlight clusters now integrated into the egg-crate grille.

====Mark V (1960)====
For 1960, the Continental Mark V saw another styling update, with flatter front bumpers (with Dagmars). The Continental badging was restyled, with &quot;Mark V&quot; badging moved to the rear fenders. On the front fenders, four horizontal chrome spears were added. Using a similar layout as the Mark IV, the Mark V was given a restyled grille. The 1960 Continental features a beautiful one year only restyled dashboard. The rear grille and bumper were also completely restyled setting it apart from the previous two years. The rear suspension was changed from coil spring to leaf springs, the fusebox was placed under the hood for ease of access and cruise control was offered for the first time.

====Town Car/Limousine====
Alongside the Mark III, IV, and V, there are two additional models of the third-generation Continental. In 1959, Lincoln added the Limousine and Town Car body styles; the latter marked the first use of the Town Car name by Lincoln. Available only in black, both versions were built with a model-specific formal rear roofline with a padded vinyl roof and smaller rear window for privacy. The Limousine featured a retractable partition between the front and rear seats with a rear seat radio on the back of the front seat. The wheelbase remained the same 131 inches on the limousine as the other Continental models and the rear seating was also the same dimensions. Priced at $10,230 for the limousine and $9207 for the Town Car, these cars came equipped with every optional accessory offered that year. The air conditioning capacity was increased with the addition of a trunk mounted evaporator to increase rear seat cooling.

The 1959–1960 Town Car and Limousine are among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever sold; only 214 examples of the $9,200 () Town Car were produced and only 83 examples of the $10,200 Limousine were produced ().
===Nameplate reuse===
Nearly 40% lower in price than the Continental Mark II, the Mark III would go on to sell better than the Mark II predecessor. From 1958 to 1960, the Lincoln Division would lose over $60 million ($ in dollars ); along with the launch of newly developed vehicles in a recession economy, a factor that contributed to the downfall of the Edsel line. Lincoln and Continental were faced with overcoming the expense of developing a vehicle that was shared with neither Ford nor Mercury.

In 1961, as Lincoln redesigned its model line, the Continental went from being a flagship marque over Lincoln to the only model line sold by Lincoln for the next 16 years. In the mid-1960s, Ford made a decision to develop a new successor to the Mark II, naming it the Continental Mark III, effectively continuing the Mark series. As with the Mark II and the 1958–1960 Continentals, it was sold, marketed, and serviced by Lincoln, though not officially badged as such. As part of the launch, the existence of the 1958 Continental Mark III that shared its name was heavily downplayed; a second nickname to this generation is dubbed the &quot;forgotten Marks&quot;

==Fourth generation (1961–1969)==
For the 1961 model year the Lincoln range was consolidated into one model. Following the $60 million in losses ($ in dollars ) to develop the 1958–1960 cars, all models were replaced by a new Lincoln Continental. Making its first appearance since 1948, the fourth-generation was available only as a four-door sedan and convertible until its 1966 model year refresh. The 1961 four-door sedan was listed at US$6,067 ($ in dollars ) and manufactured 22,303 while the convertible was listed at US$6,713 ($ in dollars ) and manufactured 2,857.

The new generation was nearly 15 inches shorter overall with a 8&quot; shorter wheelbase over its predecessor, though heavier than its Cadillac or Imperial counterparts. Its construction and post-build quality control reflected Ford corporate management&#x27;s commitment to quality.

The 1961 Lincoln Continental and its designers received a bronze medal by the Industrial Design Institute (IDI) of New York. It also won Car Life&#x27;s 1961 Engineering Excellence Award.

===Development===
The fourth-generation Lincoln Continental was styled by Ford design vice president Elwood Engel. In mid-1958, Lincoln was struggling against Cadillac, with its lack of profitability putting the future of the division at risk. In 1958, Engel developed a proposal for the 1961 Ford Thunderbird with staffers Howard Payne and John Orfe. While the proposal was not selected for the Thunderbird, the design interested Ford executives to the point of desiring the vehicle as a four-door Lincoln.

At the time of the approval, Ford product planners had come to two conclusions critical to restoring the Lincoln Division to profitability. First, to instill design continuity, Lincoln would adopt a model cycle distinct from Ford or Mercury, moving from three years to eight or nine. Second, the 1958 Lincoln model line was too large for a standard-length sedan; consequently, the 1961 Lincoln would have to decrease its exterior footprint.

===Chassis===
The fourth-generation Lincoln Continental rode on a stretched version of the unibody platform produced for the 1961 Thunderbird, lengthened to a 123-inch wheelbase from market launch to 1963. This was then extended to 126 inches and retained until 1969.

The only engine available was the MEL V8 carried over from the Mark V. It was expanded to 462 cubic inches on 1966 models, becoming the largest-displacement engine ever used in a Ford Motor Company passenger car. A new engine, the &quot;385-series&quot;-based V8, took its place by 1969, shared with the Continental Mark III. All versions of the Continental were fitted with a 3-speed automatic transmission. New for 1966 was Ford&#x27;s C6 automatic, designed for use in big block, high-horsepower V8 engines.

===Body===
At its launch, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental was offered solely as a four-door, as either a sedan or a convertible. For the first time on a Lincoln since 1951, rear doors were rear-hinged (suicide doors). To alert drivers of open doors, Lincoln fitted the dashboard with a &quot;Door Ajar&quot; warning light as seen on many modern automobiles. Latching at the B-pillar with a vacuum-operated central locking system, convertibles used an abbreviated pillar while sedans were &quot;pillared hardtops.” In the configuration, a thin B-pillar supported the roof structure while all four doors utilized frameless door glass in the style of a hardtop or convertible; the layout would become used by several Ford Motor Company sedans during the 1960s and 1970s.

In what would be the first four-door convertible from a major American manufacturer after World War II, the Lincoln Continental convertible was fitted with a power-operated top on all examples. Deriving its mechanism from the Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner hardtop convertible, the Continental was fitted with a fabric roof that stored under a rear-hinged deck lid/filler panel. In a similar fashion as the Skyliner, to access the trunk for storage, the deck lid was opened electrically without raising or lowering the roof.

Due to the overlap of the front- and rear-door window weatherstripping on the four-door convertibles (with &quot;suicide&quot; doors), to open the rear door when the front door was closed required that the rear-door window be slightly lowered first. This was accomplished automatically using sensors and relay-controlled logic—when the outside door latch button or inside handle was first pressed, the power-operated window lowered a few inches, then raised when the door was closed.

An option for 1964–1965 was the vertically adjustable steering column. Unlike most tilt-adjustable columns that employ a lever-activated locking pivot joint just behind the steering wheel the Lincoln version employed a vacuum-actuated clamp, a dash-mounted height indicator window and a pivot point further down the column.
===Model timeline===
During its production, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental would be produced in three versions, undergoing model revisions in 1964 and 1966.

===1961–1963===
The 1961 Lincoln Continental was introduced with four-door sedan and four-door convertible versions, replacing the Lincoln Premiere and Lincoln Continental Mark V. For the first time in a car manufactured in the United States, the Lincoln Continental was sold with a 2 year/ bumper-to-bumper warranty. California walnut veneer was used on the doors and instrument panel.

For 1962, a simpler front grille design with floating rectangles and a thin center bar replaced the heavy-gauge, Thunderbird-like, high mounted bumper of the &#x27;61.

For 1963, the Continental underwent several functional updates. The front seatbacks were modified in an effort to increase rear seat legroom. To increase luggage space, the trunklid was reshaped. In line with a number of vehicles in the United States, the electrical charging system introduced an alternator, replacing the generator.
===1964–1965===
For 1964, the Lincoln Continental underwent its first mid-cycle redesign. Alongside styling updates, several functional changes were focused towards increasing rear-seat space. The wheelbase was increased from 123 to 126 inches, shifting the rear seats backward. The roofline underwent several changes, with the adoption of flat side glass (replacing curved window glass). To increase rear headroom, the rear roofline became additionally squared off, in a notchback style.

In a slight exterior restyling, to eliminate the &quot;electric shaver&quot; appearance, the front fascia added vertical chrome accents to the grille; the recessed rear grille was replaced by a much simpler decklid with trim panel (moving the fuel-filler door to the left-rear fender). The interior was completely revised with a full-width instrument panel, updated upholstery patterns, door panels and fittings.

In 1964, Lincoln debuted the Continental Town Brougham concept car, which had a 131-inch wheelbase, overall length at 221.3, and had a retractable glass partition between the front and rear compartments, with an exposed area over the front compartment, in typical 1930s style town car/brougham appearance.

For 1965, Lincoln made additional updates to the Continental. In a styling change, the convex &quot;electric shaver&quot; front fascia was replaced by a more angular blunt hood with an upright flat grille design. As part of the redesign, the front turn signals and parking lights are moved from the front bumpers to wraparound lenses on the front fenders, with similar parking lights/turn signals on the rear; all four lights received metal trim to match the horizontal lines of the new grille. To improve braking ability, the Continental was given Kelsey-Hayes disc brakes for the front wheels; in addition, front seat belts with retractors became standard.
===1966–1969===
For 1966, the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental underwent a second mid-cycle redesign. To better compete against the Cadillac Coupe de Ville and the Imperial Crown Coupe, Lincoln introduced its first two-door pillarless hardtop since 1960. The convertible remained offered solely as a four-door. In an effort to increase sales of the five year-old model range, Lincoln reduced the price of the Continental nearly $600 from 1965 while keeping equipment levels identical. The marketing decision proved successful; boosted by the introduction of the two-door body style, the model range increased sales by 36%.

While following much of the 1965 restyling (distinguished in &#x27;66 largely by a new grille and the addition of &quot;Continental&quot; to the hood), the 1966 Lincoln Continental wore an all new body, growing 5 inches longer (implemented primarily in the rear seats to accommodate more legroom), and nearly an inch taller and wider. Curved side glass made its return (with less obvious tumblehome, to increase interior room). To offer an engine sized comparably to those in the Imperial (440 cubic inches in 1966) and Cadillac (429 cubic inches, 472 cubic inches in 1968), the 430 V8 was enlarged to 462 cubic inches.

The convertible underwent several equipment revisions for the first time, adding a glass rear window and the top mechanism added a second hydraulic pump for opening the convertible roof and the trunklid (making the two systems separate); hydraulic solenoids were deleted from the top mechanism. The interior underwent several revisions, adding a tilt steering wheel and an 8-track tape player as options.

For 1967, the Lincoln Continental was given only minor trim updates, with the deletion of the Lincoln star emblem from the front fenders being the largest change. Several functional changes were made, as Lincoln added a number of indicator lights to the dashboard. Along with an oil pressure warning light, the dashboard was given indicator lights for an open trunk and the cruise control (if on). Following federal safety mandates, lap safety seatbelts became standard equipment, coupled with an energy-absorbing steering column.

Following years of decreasing sales, 1967 marked the final year of the Lincoln Continental convertible, with only 2,276 sold. After becoming the first four-door convertible sold after World War II, the Lincoln Continental would become the final (as of the 2018 model year) example of its type sold by an American manufacturer. As a result of numerous frame reinforcements required by the lack of a fixed roof, the 1967 Lincoln Continental convertible is one of the heaviest passenger cars ever sold by Ford Motor Company.

For 1968, Lincoln made several styling changes to the Continental. To meet federal safety standards, the parking lights, taillights, and front turn signals were returned to a wraparound design on the fenders to satisfy Federal standards for side marker lights. For the interior, torso seatbelts were added for the outboard front seats. The &quot;Continental&quot; wording was removed from the front fascia, replaced by the Lincoln star emblem (as seen on the rear); the hood ornament was deleted, in anticipation of a federal ban on the feature (which never came to effect). The new Ford &quot;Lima&quot; engine was to be available at the beginning of the model year, but there were so many Ford MEL engine engines still available, the 460 was phased in later that year. In April, the new Mark III made its debut, as a 1969 model. Total sales would be down to just 39,134.

For 1969, few changes were made in the final year of production. To comply with federal regulations, the front seats were updated with head restraints for the outboard passengers. The front fascia was updated, with the grille enlarged for the first time since 1966, with the &quot;Continental&quot; wording returning above the grille. Shared with the Mark III, the 460 V8 became the sole engine for the Lincoln Continental, paired with the Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission.

After a nine-year hiatus, the Town Car name made a return in 1969 as part of an interior trim option package for the Continental.
=== Presidential state cars ===

The Secret Service acquired two versions of the fourth-generation Lincoln Continental for use as a presidential state car, serving from 1961 to 1977.

SS-100-X is a 1961 Lincoln Continental limousine modified by Hess &amp; Eisenhardt of Cincinnati, Ohio. Designed as an open car with a series of tops for inclement weather, the car was rebuilt with a permanent roof, armoring, and bulletproof glass following the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Subsequently, all United States presidential limousines have been constructed as armored vehicles.

The Secret Service acquired a 1969 Lincoln Continental limousine for Richard Nixon; although an armored vehicle, the limousine roof was designed with a sunroof to allow President Nixon to stand in the vehicle to greet crowds in a motorcade.

===Sales===


==Fifth generation (1970–1979)==

For the 1970 model year, Lincoln introduced the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental. Building on the success of the Mark III introduced the year before, Lincoln sought to modernize the Continental for the 1970s after a nine-year production run.

Although shorter in wheelbase and slightly narrower than 1958–1960 Lincolns, the addition of 5-mph bumpers make 1977–1979 Lincolns the longest automobiles ever produced by Ford Motor Company.

===Chassis===
The fifth-generation Lincoln Continental reverted to body-on-frame construction, the first Lincoln to do so since 1957. To save on its engineering and development costs, the Continental was no longer given its own chassis, instead given a longer-wheelbase version of the Mercury Marquis chassis (stretched from 124 inches to 127 inches; 1974–1979 vehicles received a 127.2-inch wheelbase). The 1974 four-door sedan was listed at US$8,238 ($ in dollars ) and 29,351 were sold.

Shared with the LTD and Marquis, the Continental was equipped with coil springs at all four corners. From 1970 to 1974, the Continental was fitted with front disc and rear drum brakes; from 1975 to 1979, four-wheel disc brakes were available.

The 460 cubic-inch V8 returned as the standard engine, becoming available from 1970 to 1977; from 1970 to 1972, the 460 remained exclusive to Lincoln. In an effort to increase fuel economy and comply with emissions standards, Lincoln added a 400 cubic-inch V8 for California for 1977, with the 460 remaining available in 49 states. For 1978, the 400 became standard (with the 460 as an option), with the 460 discontinued for 1979. Both engines were paired with the Ford C6 3-speed automatic transmission.

===Body===
In a major departure from its fourth-generation predecessor, the 1970 Lincoln Continental&#x27;s Marquis-based frame forced the sedan to abandon &quot;suicide doors&quot; for conventional front-hinged doors. As with its predecessor and the Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was offered as a two-door hardtop and as a four-door &quot;pillared hardtop&quot; sedan (B-pillar with frameless door glass). Unlike Ford or Mercury, no Lincoln two-door convertible was introduced.

Shared with the Mark series, the fifth-generation Continental was equipped with vacuum-operated hidden headlamps; as a fail-safe, the headlamp doors were designed to open in the event of failure (a dashboard indicator light indicated their status).

===Model timeline===
During its production, the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental was sold in two versions, with a major revision in 1975. Following the downsizing of the full-size General Motors and Chrysler product lines, the Lincoln Continental became the largest mass-market automobile produced worldwide for the 1977 model year. It was surpassed only by purpose-built limousines such as the long-wheelbase version of the Mercedes-Benz 600, the Rolls-Royce Phantom VI, and the ZIL-4104. Following the 1979 downsizing of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was marketed as the final &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;large&quot; sedan in the United States.

===1970–1974===
For 1970, Lincoln introduced a redesigned Continental two-door, Continental four-door, and Continental Town Car; sold only as a four-door, the Town Car was distinguished by a vinyl roof.

For 1971, the grille underwent a minor styling change, partially in an effort to better distinguish the Continental from the Mercury Marquis. The grille and headlight doors were redesigned, with the latter painted in body color. Rear-wheel ABS brakes (called Sure-Trak) was optional.

For 1972, several functional changes were made, as the 460 V8 decreased in compression; though intended to decrease emissions and adapt to unleaded gasoline, output dropped. The tradition of Lincoln-exclusive engines came to an end, as Mercury began use of the 460 in the Mercury Marquis and Colony Park as an option. Minor styling changes were made, as the grille and the fenders were restyled; to better separate the Continental from the Mark IV, Lincoln reintroduced chrome fender trim. For the first time since 1967, the Continental was equipped with a hood ornament. On the inside, more rear seat legroom was added.

For 1973, the Lincoln Continental was brought into compliance with federal crash regulations as it was fitted with a 5-mph front bumper. While a number of vehicles underwent significant revisions to comply with the regulation, the Continental was able to meet the standard by moving its front bumper several inches forward and fitting it with rubber-tipped impact overriders. The rear bumper was modified in a similar manner, with a 2 1/2 mph rating; in total, the Continental gained nearly 5 inches in length.

As a counterpart to the Continental Town Car, a two-door Continental Town Coupe was introduced. In a similar fashion as the Town Car, the Town Coupe was distinguished by its padded vinyl top.

For 1974, the Lincoln Continental was given a new grille, moving from an egg-crate style to a waterfall design. As part of federal regulations, a 5-mph bumper was added to the rear, leading to a redesign of the rear bumper; the taillamps were moved from inside the bumper to above it.
===1975–1979===
After 5 years on the market, Lincoln made an extensive revision to the Continental. Coinciding with the 1975 introduction of the Mercury Grand Marquis, Lincoln and Mercury sought to better visually differentiate their two flagship model lines, in spite of their mechanical commonality. As part of the revision, the Lincoln Continental was able to adopt a greater degree of styling commonality with the Continental Mark IV. For 1975, the exterior of the Lincoln Continental underwent a major revision. Although the body below the beltline saw only minor change with the taillights redesigned with vertical units, the roofline was completely restyled. To separate itself from the Mark IV, the two-door Continental/Town Coupe adopted a fully pillared roofline with a square opera window in the C-pillar. In place of the pillared hardtop shared with the Mercury Marquis and Ford LTD, the four-door Continental/Town Car adopted a wide B-pillar; to distinguish itself from the Cadillac Sixty Special Brougham; Town Cars were given the oval opera window introduced on the Mark IV. Along with the styling upgrades, 1975 Lincolns received substantial upgrades to the braking system. Designed by Bendix, the Lincoln Continental became one of the first American cars equipped with a 4-wheel disc brake system (as an option). To further improve the emissions performance of the 460 V8, the engine was fitted with catalytic converters, ending its compatibility with leaded regular gasoline.

For 1976, the exterior remained essentially the same as the year before (marking the first carryover styling year for Lincoln since 1963). In an effort to price the Continental more competitively, Lincoln deleted a number of previously standard features, making them extra cost options.

For 1977, the Lincoln Continental would undergo another exterior revision. The wide Mercury-style grille was replaced by a narrower, Rolls-Royce-style radiator grille, taking cues from the outgoing Mark IV grille. Variations of such grilles would continue to front Lincolns through 1997. In another trim revision, the &quot;Continental&quot; script was removed from the rear fenders.

For 1978, the dashboard was updated for the first time, as the Lincoln Continental adopted a revised version of the Mercury Grand Marquis dashboard. In addition to increasing parts commonality, the update was done to save weight; the plastic-frame Mercury dashboard was lighter than the previous steel-frame version. In a similar move, Lincoln redesigned the rear fender skirts, adopting a version that covered less of the rear wheels. Alongside the optional sliding glass sunroof, a fixed glass moonroof with an interior sunshade was introduced (for the first time since the 1955 Ford Skyliner).

For 1979, the interior underwent further updating, as the Mercury-sourced dashboard received additional wood trim. The 460 V8 was deleted from the Lincoln/ Mark V model line entirely, leaving the 400 V8 as the sole engine.

===Special editions===
Throughout its production, the fifth-generation Lincoln Continental was offered with several special-edition option packages. In contrast to the Mark series, the fifth-generation Continental was not offered with any Designer Series editions.

====Golden Anniversary (1971)====
To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lincoln in 1971, a &quot;Golden Anniversary Town Car&quot; was offered as a limited-edition option package for the Lincoln Continental. Although technically available in any of 25 paint colors available for any Lincoln, the Golden Anniversary Town Car featured an exclusive gold moondust metallic paint color as an option; 1,040 examples were painted in the gold moondust color. All examples were given a color-keyed vinyl roof with a color-keyed leather interior (with trim exclusive to the package).

Other features included a commemorative brochure, a glove compartment vanity mirror, a commemorative plaque on the dashboard, and keys plated in 22-karat gold presented in a jewelry box. In total, 1,575 examples were produced; initial production was 1,500 vehicles, with an additional 75 produced exclusively for employees within Ford Motor Company.

====Williamsburg Edition (1977–1979)====
From 1977 to 1979, Lincoln sold a &quot;Williamsburg Edition&quot; Continental Town Car. Intended as a cosmetic option package, the Williamsburg Edition was the only Continental or Town Car sold with two-tone paint; the edition also standardized a number of options. Along with two-tone paint, the Williamsburg Edition also included a full vinyl roof, pinstriping, power vent windows, lighted vanity mirrors, and 6-way twin &quot;Comfort Lounge Seats&quot;.

For 1977, the option package was designed as one of the most conservative versions of the Town Car, without any opera windows or coach lights fitted to the roofline. For 1978 and 1979, the opera windows and coach lights were added to the roofline.

==== Collector&#x27;s Series (1979) ====
To commemorate the end of production of the Lincoln Continental and Continental Mark V while denoting them as the final &quot;traditional&quot; full-size American sedans and coupes, Lincoln offered a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Series&quot; for both the Continental and Mark V. As with its Mark V counterpart, the Continental Collector&#x27;s Series was equipped with essentially every available feature as standard equipment. Limited options were available for the Collector&#x27;s Series including: a fixed glass moonroof or a power moonroof, which also required a full-vinyl roof; a 40-channel CB radio; a choice of four-wheel disc brakes with Sure-Track &quot;or&quot; a 2.75 Traction-Lok rear axle; an illuminated outside thermometer; an engine block heater; a choice of Midnight Blue leather or Kasman II luxury cloth interior. The Continental Collector&#x27;s Series could reach $19,200. Within Ford Motor Company, it was only surpassed by its Mark V Collector&#x27;s Series counterpart at the time, which could reach $23,639.

The Continental Collector&#x27;s Series was produced in four colors: Midnight Blue Metallic, White and limited-issue Diamond Blue Metallic (197 built) and Light Silver Metallic (125 built) with a Midnight Blue Valino grain Coach vinyl roof.

=== Production ===

==Sixth generation (1980)==
With the impending adoption of federal fuel-economy standards (CAFE) making the large cars of the 1970s a potential financial threat to Ford Motor Company, for 1979, Ford and Mercury full-size sedans underwent extensive downsizing; Lincoln became the final American brand to release to a downsized model range for the 1980 model year. In another extensive model change, the Lincoln Continental became the counterpart of the newly introduced Continental Mark VI, the first Mark series model range smaller than its predecessor.

While lagging behind Cadillac for three years to downsize its model range, the redesign of the Continental provided Lincoln with the best year-to-year fuel economy improvement (38%) in Ford history. Alongside a massive reduction of curb weight, the introduction of a 4-speed overdrive transmission enabled Lincoln to surpass its competitors, switching from the brand with the worst 1979 CAFE rating to the most fuel-efficient full-size car sold.

One of the most technologically advanced vehicles ever sold by Ford at the time, the 1980 Continental introduced a standard 4-speed automatic overdrive transmission, electronic fuel injection with computer-controlled engine management (EEC-III), digital instrument panel, and trip computer (measuring real-time and average fuel economy figures and driving range). Throughout the decade, many of the features would make their way into many other Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles.

The sixth generation of the Lincoln Continental would be offered only for 1980. To eliminate saturation of the Lincoln model line, the sixth-generation Continental was re-released as the Lincoln Town Car for 1981 (effectively lasting through the 1989 model year). Following the 1980 withdrawal of the Versailles and the introduction of the Town Car, the Continental nameplate was shifted to the mid-size segment for the 1982 model year (skipping the 1981 model year). While never officially announced as the replacement for the Versailles, the 1982 Continental became the Lincoln competitor for the Cadillac Seville. The Mark VI ended its model run after the 1983 model year and was replaced by the Mark VII, a far different vehicle.

===Chassis===
Central to the redesign was the adoption of the all-new Ford Panther platform, shared with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis. While retaining the body-on-frame layout of its predecessor and using a rear-wheel drive powertrain, the Panther platform made major engineering changes to lower curb weight. In addition, the chassis itself was smaller in several key dimensions. While only approximately 2 inches narrower, the 1980 Continental shed 10 inches of its wheelbase and 14 inches in length. In losing nearly 1000 pounds of curb weight, the 1980 Continental came within 200 pounds of the curb weight of the &quot;compact&quot; Lincoln Versailles.

In its focus on fuel economy, the Panther platform was developed without the use of the 400 or 460 V8s powering full-size Lincoln-Mercurys throughout the 1970s. In their place was the first fuel-injected V8 engine produced by Ford Motor Company. Based on the 302 cubic-inch small block V8, the newly christened 129 hp 5.0L V8 (rounded up from its true 4.9L displacement) was the first &quot;metric-displacement&quot; American Ford engine. As an option, a 140 hp carbureted 351 cubic-inch Windsor V8 was available. In place of the C6 3-speed automatic transmission was an all-new 4-speed Automatic Overdrive Transmission (AOD). Developed under the name Ford Integral Overdrive (FIOD), this industry-first transmission featured both a mechanically engaged overdrive (0.67/1 ratio) fourth gear and third and fourth-gear torque converter lock-up.

The new Panther platform allowed for changes in the new Continental&#x27;s suspension geometry and many improvements were made to the power steering. With this, and the reduced overall size, the 1980 Lincoln Continental was able to retain the traditional big car ride and feel, while offering a major enhancement to its handling. Compared to the 1980 Continental&#x27;s GM and Chrysler counterparts and the 1979 Lincoln models, the new car offered more agile maneuvering, as well as a reduced turn diameter by over 8 feet (compared to the 1979 Lincoln Continental).

===Body===
Although sharing a common platform and powertrain with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis, the Lincoln Continental was well differentiated from its counterparts; no visible body panels were common between the three vehicles. In contrast, the 1980 Continental was positioned as the base model of the Lincoln model line; the Continental Town Car/Town Coupe made its return as the top-trim model. As all Continentals wore padded roofs, Continental Town Cars were largely differentiated by two-tone paint. Lincolns were differentiated from Continental Mark VIs by their exposed headlights and full-width taillamps (instead of a &quot;Continental spare tire trunk&quot;). Two-door Lincolns can be distinguished from Mark VI two-doors with their &quot;notchback&quot; roofline; they share a common wheelbase with four-door Lincolns.

=== Production ===

==Seventh generation (1982–1987)==

Lincoln entered the 1980 model year facing a critical issue regarding the competitiveness of its brand. Though the introduction of the Continental and Mark VI both placed Lincoln in compliance with CAFE regulations and delivered the division an all-new model line, after the discontinuation of the Lincoln Versailles in early 1980, the Lincoln line now consisted of two full-size sedans that were functionally identical to each other. Though the premium Mark VI was fitted with different interior trim, it offered little visual differentiation over the Continental beyond its hidden headlamps, oval opera windows, and rear bodywork (featuring the &quot;spare tire&quot; trunklid of the Mark series).

For 1981, Lincoln responded by rebranding its full-size sedans under the Town Car name (the Mark VI ended its model cycle after 1983). The Continental returned in October 1981 for 1982, becoming a mid-size competitor for the Cadillac Seville. The smaller line was not intended to replace the Versailles directly (as late as 1980, a second-generation Versailles remained in development by Ford), though the new Continental would adopt a similar exterior footprint. Sold exclusively as a four-door sedan, it was marketed alongside the two-door Mark VII (introduced in 1984), with both vehicles featuring a &quot;spare tire&quot; trunklid.

Using the lessons learned from the badge engineering of the Versailles, Lincoln stylists took great care to visually distinguish the expensive Lincoln Continental from the Ford Granada and Mercury Cougar sedans. In contrast to the Cadillac Cimarron (also introduced for 1982), the Continental shared no visible body panels with any vehicles sharing its platform architecture.

===Chassis===
The first mid-size Lincoln, the 1982 Continental moved from the Panther platform (now used for the Lincoln Town Car) to the rear-wheel drive Ford Fox platform, adopting the long-wheelbase variant (108.5 inches) used by the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar XR7 coupes. In contrast to its 1980 predecessor, the 1982 Continental shed 18 inches in length and nearly 9 inches of wheelbase, along with over 400 pounds of weight.

The Continental introduced gas-charged shock absorbers (as an American industry first); retuned versions of the components were later introduced on the Mustang SVO. Four-wheel disc brakes made their return (for the first time since 1979), with hydroboost-assisted braking (unlike the SVO). As part of the 1984 model update, the coil springs were replaced by the 4-wheel air springs of the Mark VI, using a computer to maintain a constant ride height. For 1985, the Continental adopted 4-channel anti-lock brakes (ABS) alongside the Mark VI; far more advanced than the 1970s &quot;Sure-Track&quot; system used by the Mark IV and Mark V, ABS was standard on all Designer Series units and either standard or an option on 5.0L Continentals (though not any 2.4L vehicles).

==== Powertrain details ====
At its launch, the seventh-generation Continental was offered with two different engines. A carbureted 5.0 L V8 (producing ) was the standard engine. As a no-cost option, a 3.8 L V6 was offered (the first non-V8 engine offered in a Lincoln since 1948). For 1983, both engines were dropped, replaced by a fuel-injected 5.0 L V8 shared with the Town Car. For 1984, the throttle-body 5.0 L gained electronic control for its fuel injection, increasing output to 140hp. For 1986, the V8 adopted the sequential fuel-injection (SEFI) system, sharing the 150hp version used by the Panther platform.

For the entire production of the seventh-generation Continental, the V6 and the V8 engines were exclusively paired with the 4-speed Ford AOD overdrive transmission.

In response to diesel-engine options offered by Cadillac and by several European luxury brands, Lincoln introduced a diesel-engine offering for 1984, sourcing a 2.4L inline-6 turbodiesel from BMW (with a ZF 4-speed automatic transmission), producing 114hp. Several revisions were made to the chassis to accommodate the new powertrain, including true dual exhaust, a heavier-duty radiator (adopted by the 1993 Ford Mustang Cobra R), additional hood insulation, and a rubber strip to minimize vibrations between the firewall and strut towers. Though capable of up to 35mpg on the highway, only 1,500 units were sold, leading Lincoln to discontinue the option after 1985.

=== Body ===
Developed to compete with the Cadillac Seville, the 1982 Lincoln Continental shared its distinguishing styling feature: a sloping &quot;bustle-back&quot; decklid. The design feature had origins from the late 1930s (including certain models of the Lincoln-Zephyr) and was popularized after World War II by coachbuilt Rolls-Royce sedans; at the time, the Daimler DS420 limousine retained the design (until its 1992 retirement). Along with a longer, more upright-angled design (offered with plentiful two-tone color combinations), the bodywork was fitted with a horizontal brushed-chrome strip that ran along each side, giving it a more conventional appearance than the Seville and the (Chrysler) Imperial (a competitor to the Mark VI coupe that also offered similar rear bodywork design).

For the first time on a Lincoln-badged Continental, the model line was styled with its namesake &quot;Continental spare tire&quot; decklid (an identifying feature of the Mark series); unlike the Versailles (which had a similar decklid feature), the decklid was lettered &quot;CONTINENTAL&quot; rather &quot;LINCOLN&quot;. To reduce weight, the hood, bumpers, and front fenders were made of aluminum; the latter were spring-loaded, intended to discharge in the event of a collision (to reduce damage). All models were also fitted with Ford&#x27;s proprietary door-mounted keypad system, marketed as its &quot;Securicode&quot;, (not to be confused with a Remote Keyless Entry System). For 1983, the front turn signal lenses were changed from clear to orange.

The narrower Fox platform precluded the fitment of a traditional front bench seat; twin front bucket seats were now standard. A digital dashboard became standard equipment, including a multi-function trip computer. For 1983, the integrated garage door opener was updated to work three doors (effectively, a HomeLink transmitter of the time); an electrochromic rear-view mirror (self-dimming) was introduced as a first-time option.

==== 1984 revision ====
Coinciding with the introduction of the two-door Continental Mark VII, the Continental was given a styling update for the 1984 model year, bringing it closer in line with its two-door counterpart. To save costs, the aluminum bodywork (including the spring-loaded fenders) was removed from production. Though retaining recessed quad sealed-beam headlamps, the Continental adopted wraparound headlamp housings, which now integrated the cornering lamps. The decklid adopted the electric trunklid closure feature from the Mark VII as standard equipment. All Continentals now came with aluminum wheels, with a full disc wheel replacing the previous wheel covers. For 1985 only, the Continental dropped all Lincoln badging (alongside the Mark VII, it held a non-Lincoln VIN at the time). For 1986, the Continental saw its Lincoln badging return (as both it and the Mark VII officially adopted Lincoln VINs); to comply with government mandates, the model line adopted a center brake light (CHMSL).

The interior underwent an update; alongside adopting the digital instrument panel of the Mark VII, new seats were introduced, along with new (real) wood trim and an overhead console. For 1985, Lincoln added a hands-free mobile phone as an option; at $3,135, the expensive option was only offered for a single model year. For 1986, in another American industry first, the upgraded Ford JBL sound system offers a compact-disc player as a factory-installed option (two years after dropping the 8-track player). For 1987, the real wood trim of the interior was retired in favor of imitation wood.

===Trim===
For 1982, the Continental was offered in base trim, Signature Series, and Givenchy Designer Series trim. For 1983, the Signature Series was dropped by the Continental, with the base model adding a &quot;Platinum&quot; luxury option package; along with a namesake exterior color, the option standardized several luxury options. The Valentino Designer Series was added, including a separate exterior/interior design from the Givenchy Series; on Designer Series trunklids, the Lincoln star emblem was replaced by each the logo of each designer.

For 1986, the Valentino Designer Series was discontinued, leaving just the standard Continental and Givenchy Designer Series. Including many standard features, the higher-level trims added $3,100 to $3,500 to the price of a standard Continental ($8,700 to $9,800 in 2021). Fully-optioned Signature and Givenchy trims would top out above over $26,500 ($74,400 in 2021). 

=== Production ===

==Eighth generation (1988–1994)==


By the late 1980s, the Continental&#x27;s luxury segment had changed markedly from a decade before. In addition to traditional competitors Cadillac and Chrysler, the Continental now competed against Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Audi and eventually the top-of-the-line vehicles of Acura, Lexus, and Infiniti. In anticipation Lincoln completely redesigned the Continental, starting with the development of eighth generation model in the 4th quarter of 1981.

The 1988 Continental went on sale in December, 1987 and shared its unibody chassis with the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable, using its own unique body and interior design and riding a three-inch longer wheelbase. This Continental became the first front-wheel drive Lincoln and the first Lincoln since 1948 marketed without an available V8 engine. Its conservative exterior no longer featured the sloping faux spare tire, and though four inches longer, the new model was 170 pounds lighter than its predecessor. For the first time since 1980, the Continental closely matched its Cadillac Sedan de Ville counterpart in size.

By interior volume the Continental was the largest front-wheel drive car marketed in 1988, and was recognized by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; on its 1989 Ten Best list. Power was provided by a 140 hp 3.8 L Essex V6 newly introduced to the Taurus/Sable for 1988. An exclusive feature to the Continental was adaptive air-ride suspension and variable assist power steering was standard. In 1990 (MY 1991), engine output was revised to 155 hp, and to 160 hp for MY 1993. All Continentals were equipped with a 4-speed overdrive automatic transmission.

Average annual sales for the eighth generation Continental doubled vs. the previous generation model and helped the Lincoln brand to achieve record total sales in 1989 and again in 1990.

===Body===
The Continental adopted much of the aerodynamic design language of the Taurus, but had a more upright C-pillar, chrome grille, longer deck. The redesign of the sloping trunklid increased trunk space from 15 to 19 cubic feet (nearly matching the Town Car).

In October 1988 for the 1989 model year, a redesigned dash was introduced to accommodate dual air bags. This unprecedented move made the Ford Motor Company the first US automaker to offer airbags as standard equipment for both the driver and front passenger (the second automaker worldwide after Porsche&#x27;s 1987 944 Turbo). In 1989 for the 1990 model year, a minor exterior update featured a new grille, hood ornament, and taillights.

In late 1993 for MY 1994, the Continental received another facelift, with revised bumpers, rocker moldings, and bodyside moldings. Exterior trim was redesigned including a restyled argent-colored grille, redesigned taillamps, revised decklid trim, and the Lincoln nameplate is moved onto the grille and taillamps. The bucket seat option received a redesigned steering wheel.

===Trim===
As part of the redesign, Lincoln simplified the trim lineup; only standard (later named &quot;Executive&quot;) and Signature Series remained. 
For the first time since 1981, 6-passenger seating made its return. Leather seats were standard (with velour available as a no-cost option). Major options included a compact disc player, InstaClear electrically heated windshield (1988–1992), JBL sound system, power glass moonroof, door-mounted keypad system, marketed as its &quot;Securicode&quot;, anti-theft alarm system, cellular phone (starting MY 1990), three-position memory seat, and choice of wheels. For model year 1993 (1992 production), an &quot;Individual Seats&quot; group was available which ditched the usual chrome column shifter and 50/50 &quot;comfort lounge&quot; split bench seating (and 6-passenger capacity) for a center console with floor shifter (a Continental first), storage armrest, cup holder, and 5 seats. 1994 was the last year that the Continental was offered in Executive and Signature Series trims. An Executive Touring package was also available.

===Special edition===
====50th Anniversary Edition (1990)====
A 50th Anniversary Edition Continental Signature Series was offered during MY 1990 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the model. It featured &quot;50th Anniversary&quot; badging, geometric spoked aluminum wheels with unique center hub ornaments, titanium exterior paint with unique red/blue accent striping, and two-toned interior.

=== Production ===

==Ninth generation (1995–2002)==

For the 1995 model year, the Continental was substantially restyled inside and out — and launched on December 26, 1994;. The new Continental used styling cues from the Lincoln Contempra concept car, unveiled in early 1994.

Production commenced at Wixom Assembly in November 1994. While the body was all-new, the Continental shared underpinnings with the previous generation. In a departure from the previous generation, the Continental received a V8 engine for the first time since 1987 and more closely matched the Northstar V8 engine that Cadillac was using at the time. The 1995–2002 Continental was the only production vehicle in which a Ford Modular family engine was mounted transversely, and the only one to use it in a front wheel drive application. The base price for the 1995 Continental at launch was $40,750 ().
The sole engine for the Continental was the Modular/InTech 32v DOHC 4.6L V8 shared with the Lincoln Mark VIII, but slightly de-tuned for front wheel drive use. It produced and torque; was reached in 7.2 seconds. Inside, the Continental featured a plush leather interior with many amenities and advanced electronics for the time. Some of the options included JBL sound system, 6-CD changer, power moonroof, heated seats, onboard cellular phone, anti-theft alarm system, traction control, and chrome wheels. As before, buyers could choose between five and six-passenger seating, offering Bridge of Weir leather on upper trim packages.

1995 and 1996 Continentals had air ride suspension on all four wheels while the 1997 model had rear air suspension and traditional steel coil springs up front. An increasingly competitive luxury market and decontenting of the 1997 Continental saw its base price decreased by 10% that year.

===1998 facelift===

The Continental was updated again in late 1997 for 1998 with redesigned front and rear end styling. The front-end also held a strong family resemblance to the newly redesigned 1998 Town Car. Also new for 1998 was a dashboard redesign, though still keeping the reflective dash cluster. Despite these notable changes, pricing on the Continental was up only slightly over the 1997 model which itself had seen a price reduction from the year before.

For 1999, the Continental once again saw only a modest price increase to MSRP $38,525 (~$ in ) — the same price as the Town Car. The Continental offered buyers front wheel drive, while the Town Car remained rear wheel drive, and was joined by the slightly smaller Lincoln LS. This generation Continental gained seat-mounted side airbags and even more power (now up to . Six-passenger capability was still available via the no-charge option of a split-bench front seat and column shifter. Also available on the 1999 Continental was the &quot;RESCU package&quot; (Remote Emergency Satellite Cellular Unit) which included Global satellite positioning (similar to GM&#x27;s &quot;OnStar&quot;), 3-channel HomeLink compatible garage door opener mounted in the driver&#x27;s sun visor, voice-activated cellular telephone, and the Alpine audio system (which included a digital sound processor, subwoofer amplifier, and additional speakers). One could also opt for the 6-disc CD changer, heated front seats, and a tinted glass power sunroof with sliding shade.

New for 1999 was an extra-cost &quot;Luxury Appearance Package&quot; that included a wood-trimmed steering wheel and shift knob with unique two-tone seat trim and floor mats inside, and chrome alloy wheels and a special grille up front. Other available packages were the &quot;Driver Select System&quot; which included a semi-active suspension, selectable ride control, steering wheel-mounted controls for the audio and climate systems, automatic day/night outside mirrors, the &quot;Memory Profile System&quot; that recalled power steering assist and ride control settings for two drivers, and the &quot;Personal Security Package&quot; which included special run-flat tires mounted on polished alloy wheels, low tire pressure alert system, and universal garage door opener.

Between the 2000 and 2002 model years, changes to the Continental remained relatively minor as production of the model eventually came to an end. In 2000, various safety features became standard including child seat-anchor brackets, emergency trunk release, and &quot;Belt Minder&quot; system. In 2001, the universal garage door opener was now standard. A new Vehicle Communication System (VCS) featuring hands-free voice activated phone, Safety and Security Services (SOS), information services, and route guidance assistance was optional for 2002.

===Special editions===
====Diamond Anniversary Edition (1996)====
To commemorate the 75th anniversary of Lincoln, a &quot;Diamond Anniversary Edition&quot; of the Continental was offered as an option package. The package included &quot;Diamond Anniversary&quot; badging, leather seats, voice-activated cellular phone, JBL audio system, auto electrochromatic dimming mirror with compass, and traction control.

====Spinnaker Edition (1996)====
As a continuation of the version offered the year before on the Town Car, Lincoln offered a &quot;Spinnaker Edition&quot; of the 1996 Continental. The option package featured &quot;Spinnaker Edition&quot; badging, tri-coat paint, two-toned leather seats, and 16&quot; spoked aluminum wheels.

====Limited Edition (2001)====
For 2001, a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; was offered, featuring unique leather interior with &quot;Limited&quot; embroidery, two-toned interior trim, wood steering wheel, 6-disc CD changer, and 16-inch spoked aluminum wheels. It was sold as a Greenbrier Limited Edition Continental in select markets.

====Collector&#x27;s Edition (2002)====
To commemorate the end of the model run for 2002, a &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was offered featuring a genuine walnut burl steering wheel, instrument panel, and side door trim, &quot;CE&quot; logos, platinum painted grille, 10-spoke chrome wheels, and more. In addition to the Continental&#x27;s other exterior color choices, a CE-exclusive charcoal gray was also available. Approximately 2,000 were produced.

===Sales===
===Discontinuation and replacement===
After several years of declining sales, Lincoln announced that 2002 would be the last year for the Continental. Along with declining sales of the model line, Lincoln faced a significant model overlap as the Continental, LS V8, and Town Car competed in nearly the same price range. As the LS V8 was a mid-size sport luxury sedan and the Town Car was a full-size luxury sedan, the Continental was withdrawn, with the final ninth-generation vehicle rolling off the Wixom Assembly production line on July 26, 2002.

After 2002, the Continental was not directly replaced. For 2009, Lincoln introduced the MKS; while intended to replace the Town Car (which remained until 2011), the MKS was closer in length and width to the ninth-generation Continental and based on a front-wheel drive chassis (with all-wheel drive as an option). In place of a V8 engine, the MKS offered a twin-turbocharged V6 as an option. For the 2017 model year, the MKS was replaced by the new tenth-generation Continental.

==Tenth generation (2017–2020)==
After a fourteen-year hiatus, the tenth generation Continental went on sale in the fall of 2016. Previewed by a namesake concept car at the 2015 New York Auto Show, the 2017 Continental succeeds the Lincoln MKS, and was manufactured at Ford&#x27;s Flat Rock Assembly. 

Production of the Continental ended on October 30, 2020, without a replacement for the full-size sedan segment.

===Chassis===
The tenth-generation Lincoln Continental uses an extended-wheelbase variant of the CD4 platform, shared with the seventh-generation Ford Taurus. At 117.9 inches, the Continental is the longest-wheelbase Lincoln sedan since 1979 with the exception of the long wheelbase L Town Cars. Depending on trim, all-wheel drive is either optional or standard equipment, as the first generation to use of all-wheel drive.

The Continental is powered exclusively by V6 engines. As a standard engine, a 305 hp 3.7 L Ti-VCT V6, shared with the MKZ and MKS. As an option, a 335 hp 2.7 L twin-turbocharged V6 is available, shared with the Lincoln MKX. At the top of the engine lineup, the Continental is fitted with a 3.0 L twin-turbocharged V6; exclusive to the Continental and MKZ, the 3.0 L engine is the highest-horsepower engine ever fitted to a production Lincoln car (Navigator SUV is available with 3.5 L twin-turbo V6). All three engines are paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. When fitted with the 3.0 L engine, all-wheel drive (with torque vectoring) is standard equipment. 
===Body===
The tenth-generation Continental introduced a new front end design theme for the Lincoln division, shifting from the previous “bow wave” split grille to a slightly recessed rectangular design. Standard equipment includes electrically latched doors marketed as &quot;E-Latch&quot;, which also pulls the door closed. Interior door panels use a button near the door pull handle to unlatch the door; on the outside, the exterior door pulls are integrated into the beltline window trim, reminiscent of the third generation Ford Thunderbird.

Rather than a console- or column-mounted transmission shifter, the transmission is controlled by &quot;PRNDS&quot; buttons mounted to the left of the infotainment/navigation touch screen. &quot;S&quot; represents &quot;Sport mode&quot;, where the suspension, power steering, and transmission shifting are programmed for more spirited driving. While largely done in an effort to increase center console space, the layout is a similar approach to the Mercury, Chrysler and Packard designs of the mid-1950s (though the Continental is also fitted with paddle shifters as standard equipment). As an option, the Continental is available with either 13 or 19-speaker audio systems from the &quot;Revel&quot; division of Harman, distinguished by aluminum speaker grilles in the door panels. As with the Lincoln MKS, the Continental is fitted with adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping technology, as an option, the Continental offers a 360-degree camera system to produce a &quot;virtual overhead view&quot; of the vehicle.

=== Trim ===
The Continental was offered in four trim levels, Premiere, Select, Reserve and Black Label trim. Special leather, marketed as &quot;Bridge of Weir &quot;Deepsoft&quot; leather&quot; is used for upper-level trim (Select and Reserve). For the &quot;Black Label&quot; trim level, vehicles have specially-coordinated exterior and interior appearance packages, including Chalet, Thoroughbred and Rhapsody Blue (exclusive to the Continental), the latter including blue leather appointed seats, Alcantara synthetic suede, shearling carpets, mesh and aluminized fiberglass accents.

Continental chief engineer Michael Celentino noted the difficulty of executing the blue interior: &quot;Blue is a color on a knife edge, it has elements of green and red that are incredibly difficult to match on all the materials in an interior, especially when you consider the differing grain and gloss of materials ranging from the seats to the dashboard to the headliner. If you’re not careful, blue will ‘flop’ and look like those other colors when the light hits it from some angles. Ford designers ultimately gave a specific mix of hues to its colorant supplier: &quot;with other colors, that supplier would tell parts makers what hue to mix to get the right result, but Rhapsody is so demanding that Ford shipped the completed mix to each supplier to get an identical shade on seats, plastic, carpet, dash, console, doors and headliner.&quot;

Lincoln design director David Woodhouse says. “Blue was Lincoln’s iconic color. The Ford family always had dark blue Continentals. Hollywood studio MGM had a special blue created to match Liz Taylor’s eyes and gave her a Continental Mark II car that color.&quot;

===Coach Door Editions===
To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the 1939 Edsel Ford prototype, Lincoln introduced a Coach Door Edition of the Continental. The first Lincoln to feature rear-hinged passenger doors since the 1969 Continental, the vehicle is a license-built conversion of the Continental. Beginning assembly as a standard Continental at Flat Rock Assembly, the rear-hinged doors are installed by Cabot Coach Builders, a Massachusetts-based Ford QVM (Qualified Vehicle Modifier). To accommodate the longer rear doors, the company performs a six-inch wheelbase extension and reinforces the frame. The rear seat is reconfigured for two-passenger seating and a full-length center console.

Sold exclusively in the United States, 80 examples of the 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition were produced. The first Lincoln vehicle with a base price above $100,000, the Black Label trim was standard; the 400hp 3.0T twin-turbocharged V6 was paired with all-wheel drive.

For 2020, a non-commemorative Coach Door Edition was offered with the same powertrain and Black Label trim; approximately 150 were produced.

==Concept cars==

===2002 (Los Angeles Auto Show)===

One of the first projects of Lincoln under PAG, a Lincoln Continental concept car was unveiled at the 2002 Los Angeles Auto Show. Combining advanced design features with traditional Lincoln design elements, the vehicle was a full-size sedan intended to maximize passenger and cargo space; at 214.3 inches long, it was an inch shorter than a 2002 Town Car. The rear-wheel drive sedan was fitted with a 6.0L V12 paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. To ease passenger access, the Continental utilizes rear-hinged coach doors (in line with 1960s Lincolns); to further increase cabin space, a 136.6-inch wheelbase is used, effectively centering the passenger compartment.

Though the concept never reached production, several of its design elements were adapted into the Lincoln line, as its roofline was adapted by the 2006 Lincoln Zephyr (later MKZ) and its front fascia was adapted by the 2007–2010 MKX.

===2015 (New York Auto Show)===

At the 2015 New York International Auto Show, Lincoln unveiled a Lincoln Continental concept sedan, serving as a preview for the replacement of the Lincoln MKS. The &quot;rhapsody blue&quot; interior also served as a preview of the flagship Black Label trim. Though Lincoln did identify a 3.0L twin-turbo V6 as the engine for the car, it did not identify the driven wheels or platform architecture of the production vehicle.

The 2017 production Continental saw several revisions from the concept car, which was fitted with a full-length glass roof and a 2+2 seating configuration (the latter would be seen with the Coach Door Edition). Along with smaller-diameter wheels and body-color lower body trim, the production vehicle has larger air intakes in the front bumper, larger sideview mirrors, and revised headlamps and taillamps (to comply with US design standards).

<text>Reliance Communications Limited (RCOM) was an Indian mobile network provider headquartered in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra that offered voice and 2G and 3G and 4G data services. 
In February 2019, the company filed for bankruptcy as it was unable to sell assets to repay its debt. It has an estimated debt of against assets worth .

As of March 2020, the company reworked its strategy and continues to operate 4G data services, fixed-line communications, data center services, and enterprise solutions as well as subsea cable networks under the banner name, &quot;Global Cloud Xchange&quot;.

==History==
Reliance Communications was founded in India on 15 July 2004 as Reliance Infocomm Limited with the introduction of its nationwide CDMA2000 service. It became Reliance Communications Limited in 2006. The company introduced its GSM service in 2008. It began using MIMO technology in 2011 to improve the quality of its 3G service, providing a data rate of up to 28 Mbit/s.

In the 2010 spectrum auction, Reliance obtained licenses for 3G spectrum in three cities at a total licensing fee of . The company reduced the price of its 3G service by 61 percent in May 2012.

Reliance and Lenovo introduced their co-branded Android smartphones in India in 2013.

The company ended its CDMA operations in 2016, and migrated its subscribers to its GSM and LTE networks by September the same year.

=== Acquisition of MTS India and Digicable ===
On 1 July 2010, the board of Reliance Communications confirmed the acquisition of Digicable India&#x27;s largest cable network in all-stock deal. The new entity was named Reliance Digicom, which integrated RCOM&#x27;s DTH TV, IPTV and retail broadband operations with Digicable.

On 14 January 2016, Reliance Communications announced that it had acquired Sistema Shyam TeleServices Limited (SSTL, operating as MTS India) in an all-stock deal. SSTL received a 10 per cent stake in Reliance Communications after repaying its existing debt. Reliance Communications would assume responsibility for instalments that MTS owed the government for spectrum purchases, amounting to every year for 10 years. As a result of the deal, Reliance acquired MTS India&#x27;s subscribers and SSTL&#x27;s spectrum in the 850 MHz band.

India&#x27;s antitrust regulator, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved the merger in February 2016. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also cleared the deal. SSTL shareholders approved the merger on 18 March 2016. By mid-August, it was approved by tax authorities and the shareholders and creditors of Reliance and SSTL. The merger was approved by the Rajasthan High Court on 30 September 2016 and the Bombay High Court on 7 October 2016. In April 2017, Reliance laid off 600 employees in preparation for its mergers with MTS and Aircel.
The Department of Telecommunications gave the final approval for the merger on 20 October 2017. On 31 October 2017, Reliance Communications announced that the merger was complete.

=== Attempted merger with Aircel ===
In September 2016, Reliance Communications announced Aircel had agreed to a merger.

The company announced on 15 March 2017 the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Bombay Stock Exchange, and National Stock Exchange of India approved the merger. The deal was approved by the CCI on 20 March. Aircel and Reliance shareholders approved the merger on 22 and 24 April 2017, respectively, and it was expected to be completed by mid-2017.

However, on 1 October, Reliance allowed the merger agreement to lapse. The deal, which was expected to help the company repay of debt, was cancelled due to delays by entrenched competition. Reliance was looking at other options to meet their obligations under the SDR agreement and avoid insolvency proceedings by banks. Due to the failed Aircel merger, the company announced to employees in the wireless and DTH businesses on 25 October 2017 that they would be redundant effective 30 November. On 29 December 2017, Reliance discontinued voice services in India and provided only 4G data service.

=== The Ericsson case ===
In 2013, RCom signed a multi-year managed services agreement (MSA) with Ericsson to manage services of wireline and wireless network of of fiber and mobile infrastructure in 11 telecom circles in India. This arrangement was a smooth business relationship until 2016, post which RCom struggled to pay the dues. This has been seen as an effect of Reliance Jio that disrupted the Indian telecom industry with its aggressive pricing after its commercial launch in September 2016 that affected all leading telecom players.

By September 2017, Ericsson terminated the MSA and approached the NCLT to recover dues of . By May 2018, the NCLT initiated insolvency proceedings even as RCom tried to sell spectrum and other assets. At the same time, RComm reached out to Ericsson and agreed to pay as a settlement with a personal guarantee from Anil Ambani on the condition of withdrawal of insolvency proceedings. The Supreme Court reviewed the matter in August 2018 and ordered RComm to pay up to Ericsson by 30 September. RCom failed to comply with the payment and sought an extension of 60 days to comply. Ericsson filed a contempt petition in Supreme court.

In February 2019, the Supreme Court has held Anil Ambani and three others guilty of contempt of court and directed them to make payments by 19 March. In the meantime, Mukesh Ambani, the elder brother of Anil helped him with a bailout of which he paid just a day before the deadline on 18 March.
Reliance Communications Limited has paid to Swedish multinational telecom and networking firm Ericsson a day before the Supreme Court’s deadline, the Anil Ambani-led company said in a statement.

=== Sale of the company&#x27;s assets ===

During 2020, a consortium of companies bidded upwards of $200 Million USD to buy the assets of Reliance Communications. Members of the consortium include NKV Krishna&#x27;s White Lotus Group, Mukesh Ambani&#x27;s Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, UV Asset Reconstruction (UVARCL) and US-based Varde Partners.
In 2022, Mukesh Ambani&#x27;s Reliance Jio won the bid and acquired the assets of Reliance Communications for Rs. 3720 crores.

<text>The 9×19mm Parabellum (also known as 9mm Luger, 9mm NATO or simply 9mm) is a rimless, centerfire, tapered firearms cartridge.

Originally designed by Austrian firearm designer Georg Luger in 1901, it is widely considered the most popular handgun and submachine gun cartridge due to its low cost, adequate stopping power and extensive availability.

Since the cartridge was designed for the Luger semi-automatic pistol, it has been given the designation of &quot;9mm Luger&quot; by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers&#x27; Institute (SAAMI) and the (CIP).

A 2007 US survey concluded that &quot;about 60 percent of the firearms in use by police are 9mm [Parabellum]&quot; and credited 9×19mm Parabellum pistol sales with making semiautomatic pistols more popular than revolvers.

==Origins==
The cartridge was developed by Austrian firearm designer Georg Luger in 1901. The cartridge was derived from an earlier round designed by Luger (7.65×21mm Parabellum), which itself was derived from a cartridge used in the Borchardt C-93 pistol (7.65×25mm Borchardt). Shortening the length of the cartridge case used in the Borchardt pistol allowed Luger to improve the design of the toggle lock and to incorporate a smaller, angled grip.

Luger&#x27;s work on the Borchardt design evolved into the Luger pistol, which was first patented in 1898 and chambered in 7.65×21mm Parabellum. Demand from Germany for a larger caliber in their military sidearm led Luger to develop the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge for the eventual P08 pistol. This was achieved by removing the bottleneck shape of the 7.65×21mm Parabellum case, resulting in a tapered rimless cartridge encasing a bullet that was 9 millimeters in diameter.

In 1902, Luger presented the new round to the British Small Arms Committee, as well as three prototype versions to the US Army for testing at the Springfield Arsenal in mid-1903. The Imperial German Navy adopted the cartridge in 1904, and in 1908, the German Army adopted it as well.

To conserve lead during World War II in Germany, the lead core was replaced by an iron core encased with lead. This bullet, identified by a black bullet jacket, was designated as the 08 mE (—&#x27;with an iron core&#x27;). By 1944, the black jacket of the 08 mE bullet was dropped, and these bullets were produced with normal copper-colored jackets. Another wartime variation was designated the 08 sE bullet and can be identified by its dark gray jacket and was created by compressing iron powder at high temperature into a solid material (—&#x27;sintered iron&#x27;).

The name &quot;Parabellum&quot; is derived from the Latin motto of (DWM), (&#x27;If you want peace, prepare for war&#x27;).

==Popularity==
After the end of World War I, the popularity of the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge increased with the vast number of semi-automatic pistols and submachine guns being adopted by many militaries and law enforcement agencies around the world. 

From the 1980s to the 1990s, a sharp increase in popularity occurred with semi-automatic pistols in the United States by both law enforcement and military personnel, a trend foreshadowed by the adoption of the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 39 by the Illinois State Police in 1968. In addition, the Beretta M9 (a military version of the Beretta Model 92) was adopted by the US Army in 1985. Previously, most American police departments issued .38 Special and .357 Magnum caliber revolvers with a five- or six-round capacity. The .38 Special was preferred to other weapons, such as variants of the M1911, because it offered low recoil, was small and light enough to accommodate different shooters, and was inexpensive. The 9×19mm cartridge is ballistically superior to the .38 Special revolver cartridge, is shorter overall, and being an autoloader cartridge, it is stored in flat magazines, as opposed to cylindrical speedloaders. This, coupled with the advent of the so-called &quot;wonder nines&quot;, led to many US police departments exchanging their revolvers for some form of 9mm semiautomatic pistols by the late twentieth century. The 9×19mm Parabellum has become the most common caliber used by US law enforcement agencies, primarily due to the availability of controllable compact pistols with large magazine capacities that use the cartridge.

In 2013, a chart of popular calibers that was released by the website Luckygunner.com showed 9×19mm Parabellum as having 21.4% of the entire cartridge market, followed by the .223 Remington at 10.2% (with 5.56 mm included this is 15.7%). The next most popular caliber was .45 ACP.

==Cartridge dimensions==
The 9×19mm Parabellum has 0.86 ml (13.3 grains H2O) of cartridge case capacity.

The cartridge headspaces on the mouth of the case. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 250 mm (1 in 9.84 in), six grooves, ø lands = 8.82 mm, ø grooves = 9.02 mm, land width = 2.49 mm and the primer type is small pistol.

According to CIP rulings, the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In CIP-regulated countries, every pistol cartridge combination has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum CIP pressure to certify for sale to consumers. This means that 9×19mm Parabellum chambered arms in CIP-regulated countries are currently (2014) proof tested at PE piezo pressure.

The SAAMI pressure limit for the 9×19mm Parabellum is set at piezo pressure.

==Performance==

The round was originally designed to be lethal to , but is still lethal at longer ranges.
The 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge combines a flat trajectory with moderate recoil. According to the 1986 book &quot;Handloading&quot;, &quot;the modern science of wound ballistics has established beyond reasonable doubt that the 9 mm cartridge is highly effective.&quot;

In 2014, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a report detailing the potential combat effectiveness of the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge when compared to other calibers such as the .40 S&amp;W and the .45 ACP cartridges that were specifically developed for use by the FBI. The report indicated that the new powders and more advanced bullet designs used in current 9×19mm Parabellum defensive loads allowed for the caliber to deliver adequate performance compared to other calibers, like the .40 S&amp;W and .45 ACP. In addition to this, the lower recoil, less wear, cheaper ammunition, and higher capacity were all reasons that the report cited for the recent surge in orders of the ammunition from various police agencies. With a wider selection of officers able to shoot handguns chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum, many departments chose this caliber to standardize a single firearm and loading, making logistics and supply easier. Due to all these factors, law enforcement orders of 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition from all major ammunition manufacturers have risen significantly.

==Improvements and variations==
===NATO standard===
The round is also known as &quot;9mm NATO&quot; because it has become a standard pistol caliber for NATO forces. The cartridge has been manufactured by, or for, more than 70 countries.

9mm NATO can be considered an overpressure variant of 9×19mm Parabellum that is defined by NATO standards. The proof pressure is , corresponding to a maximum service pressure of (both using CIP methodology).

While the NATO standards do not specify the type of bullet to be used, Declaration III of the Hague Convention of 1899 prohibits the use of expanding ammunition in warfare by signatories, so official NATO 9 mm ammunition is FMJ &quot;ball&quot; bullets. Declaration III does not apply in conflicts involving non-signatories to the Hague Convention, including paramilitary and other nongovernmental fighting forces.

In 2021, with the standardization of STANAG-4509, NATO adopted the 5.7×28mm SMG/pistol cartridge for the PDW program. It is in the same power range as 9×19mm Parabellum but has a few additional advantages such as a larger magazine capacity and improved armor penetration.

===Swedish m/39===
9mm Parabellum entered Swedish service as m/39 with the import of the &quot;Kulsprutepistol&quot; m/39 from Austria, with a bullet weight of .
During the Congo Crisis, the Swedish UN-contingent issued complaints about the performance of the m/39 cartridge (regular 9mm Parabellum) used. This resulted in a commission of the Swedish Army establishing in 1962 that a new round was needed for the Carl Gustav m/45. The resulting m/39B had a tombac-plated steel jacket surrounding the lead core. While the lands of the barrel can cut into the tombac, the steel jacket resists deformation, thus causing the gas pressure to rise higher than the previous soft-jacketed m/39, giving the bullet a Vo of and an impact energy of 600 joules. The mantle also acts like a penetrator when striking a target, going through up to 50 layers of kevlar, 7 cm of bricks, or 25 cm of wood, allowing the bullet to defeat body armor up to Type IIIA.

===+P variant===

Attempts to improve the cartridge&#x27;s ballistics came in the early 1990s with the widespread availability of high-pressure loadings of the 9mm cartridge. Such overpressure cartridges are labeled &quot;+P&quot; (38,500 psi) or in the case of very high-pressure loadings, &quot;+P+&quot; (42,000 psi). Velocity of these rounds is improved over standard loadings. In addition, improvements in jacketed hollow-point bullet technology have produced bullet designs that are more likely to expand and less likely to fragment than earlier iterations, giving a 9mm bullet better terminal effectiveness.

===Russian military overpressure variants===
The Russian military has developed specialized 9×19mm cartridges that use relatively light bullets at high muzzle velocities for both pistols and submachine guns to defeat body armor.

Besides enhanced penetration capabilities, these overpressure variants offer a flatter trajectory and lessened recoil. The increase in service pressure causes a rise in bolt thrust, so this overpressure ammunition induces more stress on critical weapon parts during firing. After initial research conducted in the late 1980s under the codename &quot;Grach&quot;, the Russian armed forces adopted two specialized 9×19mm variants.
* 

The 7N21 (Cyrillic: 7Н21) 9×19mm overpressure variant features an armor-piercing bullet and generates a peak pressure of . The 7N21 bullet features a hardened (sub-caliber) steel penetrator core, enclosed by a bimetal jacket. The space between the core and jacket is filled with polyethylene, and the tip of the penetrator is exposed at the front of the bullet to achieve better penetration. The penetration range for body armor is specified at up to . The MP-443 Grach and GSh-18 pistols and PP-19 Vityaz, PP-90M1 and PP-2000 submachine guns were designed for use with this overpressure cartridge. &quot;Jane&#x27;s Infantry Weapons&quot; stated in 2003 that the 7N21 cartridge combined the 9×19mm Parabellum dimensions with a 9×21mm Gyurza bullet design and was developed specifically for the penetration of body armor and for the MP-443 Grach pistol, the latest Russian service pistol.

The 7N31 (Cyrillic: 7Н31) / PBP 9×19mm overpressure variant uses the same concept with a similar but lighter bullet that achieves higher muzzle velocity. The penetration of an -thick St3 steel plate is specified at up to . The 7N31 cartridge was developed in the late 1990s for the GSh-18 pistol. The 7N31 was adopted for the PP-90M1 and PP-2000 submachine guns. Its maximum service pressure remains unclear.

The construction of the two rounds allows them to be effective against both unarmored and armored targets. If the bullet strikes an unarmored target, it holds together to produce a wide wound channel. If the bullet strikes an armored target, the sleeve is stripped away, and the core penetrates alone. The disadvantage of the rounds is that high impact velocities are needed to work effectively, so the bullets are relatively light to maximize their muzzle velocity. This means they lose velocity relatively quickly, limiting their effective range.

The 7N30 (Cyrillic: 7Н30) or RG057 consists of hardened steel core tension-fitted into a metal sheath.

The 7N35 (Cyrillic: 7Н35) consists of lead core in a metal sheath. It was never accepted into service.

===Other variants===
9mm Parabellum ammunition is offered in a wide array of types and variations, designed to meet the specific needs and preferences of its users. This diversity in 9mm ammunition encompasses multiple standard categories, such as full metal jacket (FMJ), jacketed and unjacketed hollow point (JHP), frangible ammunition, soft point, tracer and other specialized variants tailored for competitive shooting or law enforcement applications. VBR-B produces specialized bullets for this cartridge, a two-part controlled fragmenting projectile and an armor-piercing bullet that features a brass sabot and a hardened steel penetrator. These are designed to increase the content of the permanent wound cavity and double the chance of hitting a vital organ.

==US data==
The energy delivered by most 9mm loads allows for significant expansion and penetration with premium hollow-point bullets. Illinois State Police, border patrol, Federal Air Marshals, and United States Secret Service favored and used +P+ 9mm loads at for years with excellent results. Massad Ayoob has stated that the &quot;Tried, Tested, and True&quot; +P or +P+ is the best self-defense load in this caliber.

&quot;Key&quot;:
*&quot;Expansion&quot;: expanded bullet diameter (ballistic gelatin)
*&quot;Penetration&quot;: penetration depth (ballistic gelatin)
*&quot;PC&quot;: permanent cavity volume (ballistic gelatin, FBI method)
*&quot;TSC&quot;: temporary stretch cavity volume (ballistic gelatin)

<doc id="609716" wikidata="Q1811946" url="?curid=609716" title="Slaughter of the Soul">
<text>Slaughter of the Soul is the fourth studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band At the Gates, released on 14 November 1995 by Earache Records. It was their last album before their eleven-year breakup from 1996 to 2007. &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; is considered a landmark in melodic death metal and played a major role in popularizing the Gothenburg scene, alongside &quot;The Jester Race&quot; by In Flames and &quot;The Gallery&quot; by Dark Tranquillity. The album was recorded and mixed in Studio Fredman, early 1995.

Music journalist T Coles described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;melodic and weird&quot;, saying that At the Gates were &quot;cleaner&quot; than fellow Swedish death metal band Entombed, yet &quot;dirtier&quot; than the technical death metal bands of the United States. 

Andy LaRocque&#x27;s neo-classical guest solo on &quot;Cold&quot; was widely acclaimed as one of the greatest metal solos and guitarist Anders Björler admitted in 2007 that he still could not play it properly.

&quot;Blinded by Fear&quot; was covered by The Haunted (composed largely of ex-At the Gates members) on their Japanese version of their live/double disc album &quot;Live Rounds in Tokyo&quot; and was also covered by Fleshgod Apocalypse on their &quot;Mafia&quot; EP. The song also appeared in the game &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; as downloadable content.

== Appearances in media ==
Tracks from the album have made appearances in several video games.

* &quot;Blinded by Fear&quot; was made available as downloadable content for the &quot;Rock Band&quot; video game series on March 28, 2008. Later, it was included in the game&#x27;s retail &quot;Metal Track Pack&quot; add-on content disc, released on September 22, 2009 in North America. The song is considered one of the most difficult songs in the series to perform on drums, due to its fast tempo.
* The title track is featured in both &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned&quot; and &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Proving Ground&quot;.

== Reissues ==
A 2002 Reissue contained 11 tracks from the original 1995 release of &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot;, plus 6 bonus audio tracks. Three of the bonus tracks were cover songs, two were demo tracks, and 1 was a previously unreleased track, recorded during the &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; sessions. The 2006 reissue contained everything from the 2002 reissue, but also included an additional bonus DVD, which featured a 35-minute behind-the-scenes documentary as the highlight. The 2008 reissue contains everything from the 2002 and 2006 rereleases (all audio and DVD material), as well as additional DVD footage—an eight-song live set, recorded in Kraków, Poland on December 30, 1995.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Reviews for &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; have been highly positive, acclaiming the album as a landmark record in the development of the Swedish death metal scene. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey awarded the album five stars and called it an &quot;excellent example of Gothenburg-style melodic death metal, and certainly the band&#x27;s best and most focused album to date.&quot;
&quot;Rock Hard&quot;, however, thinks the band has become interchangeable with its many clones, and Deathmetal.org labels it At the Gates&#x27; sellout album, sounding like &quot;Metallica attempting &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; in a stylistic mashup between Iron Maiden and Judas Priest during &quot;Painkiller.&quot;&quot;

=== Accolades ===
In 2005, the album was ranked number 300 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. Metal Injection ranked &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; eighth on their list &quot;Top 10 Influential Heavy Metal Albums&quot;. The album was inducted into the Decibel Magazine Hall of Fame in March 2005, being the second album overall to receive such award.
In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Slaughter of the Soul&quot; as 79th on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. The same magazine later ranked the title track number eighty-seven on their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time&quot;

<doc id="609717" wikidata="Q2088351" url="?curid=609717" title="Aluminium–silicon alloys">
<text>Aluminium–silicon alloys or Silumin is a general name for a group of lightweight, high-strength aluminium alloys based on an aluminum–silicon system (AlSi) that consist predominantly of aluminum - with silicon as the quantitatively most important alloying element. Pure AlSi alloys cannot be hardened, the commonly used alloys AlSiCu (with copper) and AlSiMg (with magnesium) can be hardened. The hardening mechanism corresponds to that of AlCu and AlMgSi. 

AlSi alloys are by far the most important of all aluminum cast materials. They are suitable for all casting processes and have excellent casting properties. Important areas of application are in car parts, including engine blocks and pistons. In addition, their use as a functional material for high-energy heat storage in electric vehicles is currently being focused on.

== Alloying elements ==
Aluminium-silicon alloys typically contain 3% to 25% silicon content. Casting is the primary use of aluminum-silicon alloys, but they can also be utilized in rapid solidification processes and powder metallurgy. Alloys used by powder metallurgy, rather than casting, may contain even more silicon, up to 50%. Silumin has a high resistance to corrosion, making it useful in humid environments. 

The addition of silicon to aluminum also makes it less viscous when in liquid form, which, together with its low cost (as both component elements are relatively cheap to extract), makes it a very good casting alloy. Silumin with good castability may give a stronger finished casting than a potentially stronger alloy that is more difficult to cast.

All aluminum alloys also contain iron as an admixture. It is generally undesirable because it lowers strength and elongation at break. Together with Al and Si it forms the formula_1-phase AlFeSi, which is present in the structure in the form of small needles. However, iron also prevents the castings from sticking to the molds in die casting, so that special die-casting alloys contain a small amount of iron, while iron is avoided as far as possible in other alloys.

Manganese also reduces the tendency to stick, but affects the mechanical properties less than iron. Manganese forms a phase with other elements that is in the form of globulitic (round) grains.

Copper occurs in almost all technical alloys, at least as an admixture. From a content of 0.05% Cu, the corrosion resistance is reduced. Additions of about 1% Cu are alloyed to increase strength through solid solution strengthening. This also improves machinability. In the case of the AlSiCu alloys, higher proportions of copper are also added, which means that the materials can be hardened (see Aluminum-copper alloy).

Together with silicon, magnesium forms the Mg2Si (magnesium silicide) phase, which is the basis of hardenability, similar to aluminum-magnesium-silicon alloys (AlMgSi). In these there is an excess of Mg, so the structure consists of aluminum mixed crystal with magnesium and Mg2Si. In the AlSiMg alloys, on the other hand, there is an excess of silicon and the structure consists of aluminum mixed crystal, silicon and Mg2Si.

Silicon powders are used in aluminum-silicon alloys for enhancing strength and castability, providing better durability under high-stress conditions. It also improves the fluidity of molten aluminum which allows easier casting of complex shapes with fewer defects.

Small additions of titanium and boron serve to refine the grain.

== Pure aluminium–silicon alloys ==

Aluminum forms a eutectic with silicon, which is at 577 °C, with a Si content of 12.5% or 12.6%. Up to 1.65% Si can be dissolved in aluminum at this temperature. However, the solubility decreases rapidly with temperature. At 500 °C it is still 0.8% Si, at 400 °C 0.3% Si and at 250 °C only 0.05% Si. At room temperature, silicon is practically insoluble. Aluminum cannot be dissolved in silicon at all, not even at high temperatures. Only in the molten state are both completely soluble. Increases in strength due to solid solution strengthening are negligible.

Pure AlSi alloys are smelted from primary aluminium, while AlSi alloys with other elements are usually smelted from secondary aluminium. The pure AlSi alloys are medium strength, non-hardenable, but corrosion resistant, even in salt water environments.

The exact properties depend on whether the composition of the alloy is above, near or below the eutectic point. Castability increases with increasing Si content and is best at about 17% Si; the mechanical properties are best at 6% to 12% Si.

* The mold filling capacity reaches its maximum at 12% Si, but is also good with other contents.
* The tendency to form cavities is lowest at 6% to 8% Si and considered low overall.
* The tendency to hot cracking is low with less than 6% Si.

Otherwise, AlSi alloys generally have favorable casting properties: the shrinkage is only 1.25% and the influence of the wall thickness is small.

Hypereutectic alloys, with a silicon content of 16 to 19%, such as Alusil, can be used in high-wear applications such as pistons, cylinder liners and internal combustion engine blocks. The metal is etched after casting, exposing hard, wear-resistant silicon precipitates. The rest of the surface becomes slightly porous and retains oil. Overall this makes for an excellent bearing surface, and at lower cost than traditional bronze bearing bushes.

=== Hypoeutectic alloys ===
Hypoeutectic alloys have a silicon content of less than 12%. With them, the aluminum solidifies first. As the temperature falls and the proportion of solidified aluminum increases, the silicon content of the residual melt increases until the eutectic point is reached. Then the entire residual melt solidifies as a eutectic. The microstructure is consequently characterized by primary aluminium, which is often present in the form of dendrites, and the eutectic of the residual melt lying between them. The lower the silicon content, the larger the dendrites.

In pure AlSi alloys, the eutectic is often in a degenerate form. Instead of the fine structure that is otherwise typical of eutectics with its good mechanical properties, AlSi takes the form of a coarse-grained structure on slow cooling, in which silicon forms large plates or needles. These can sometimes be seen with the naked eye and make the material brittle. This is not a problem in chill casting, since the cooling rates are high enough to avoid degeneration.

In sand casting in particular, with its slow cooling rates, additional elements are added to the melt to prevent degeneration. Sodium, strontium and antimony are suitable. These elements are added to the melt at around 720 °C to 780 °C, causing supercooling that reduces the diffusion of silicon, resulting in a common fine eutectic, resulting in higher strength and elongation at break.

=== Eutectic and near-eutectic alloys ===
Alloys with 11% Si to 13% Si are counted among the eutectic alloys. Annealing improves elongation and fatigue strength. Solidification is shell -forming in untreated alloys and smooth-walled in refined alloys, resulting in very good castability. Above all, the flowability and mold filling ability is very good, which is why eutectic alloys are suitable for thin-walled parts.
=== Hypereutectic Alloys ===
Alloys with more than 13% Si are referred to as over- or hypereutectic. The Si content is usually up to 17%, with special piston alloys also over 20%. Hypereutectic alloys have very low thermal expansion and are very wear resistant. In contrast to many other alloys, AlSi alloys do not show their maximum fluidity near the eutectic, but at 14 to 16% Si, in the case of overheating at 17% to 18% Si. The tendency to hot cracking is minimal in the range from 10% to 14%. In the case of hypereutectic alloys, the silicon crystals solidify first in the melt, until the remaining melt solidifies as a eutectic. For grain refinement copper-phosphorus alloys are used. The hard and brittle silicon leads to increased tool wear during subsequent machining, which is why diamond tools are sometimes used (See also Machinability).

== Aluminium–silicon–magnesium alloys ==
AlSiMg alloys with small additions of magnesium (below 0.3 to 0.6% Mg) can be hardened both cold and warm. The proportion of magnesium decreases with increasing silicon content, which is between 5% Si and 10% Si. They are related to the AlMgSi alloys: Both are based on the fact that magnesium silicide Mg2Si is precipitated, which is present in the material in the form of finely divided particles and thus increases the strength. In addition, magnesium increases the elongation at break. In contrast to AlSiCu, which can also be hardened, these alloys are corrosion-resistant and easy to cast. However, copper is present as an impurity in some AlSiMg alloys, which reduces corrosion resistance. This applies above all to materials that have been melted from secondary aluminium.

== Aluminium–silicon–copper alloys ==
AlSiCu alloys are also heat-hardenable and additionally high-strength, but susceptible to corrosion and less, but still adequately, castable. It is often smelted from secondary aluminium. The hardening is based on the same mechanism as the AlCu alloys. The copper content is 1% to 4%, that of silicon 4% to 10%. Small additions of magnesium improve strength. 

== Compositions of standardized varieties ==
All data are in percent by mass. The rest is aluminum.

Wrought alloys 

Cast Alloys 
== Mechanical properties of standardized and non-standard grades ==
== 4000 series ==
4000 series are alloyed with silicon. Variations of aluminium–silicon alloys intended for casting (and therefore not included in 4000 series) are also known as silumin.
== Applications ==
Within the Aluminum Association numeric designation system, Silumin corresponds to alloys of two systems: 3xxx, aluminum–silicon alloys also containing magnesium and/or copper, and 4xx.x, binary aluminum–silicon alloys. Copper increases strength, but reduces corrosion resistance.

In general, AlSi alloys are mainly used in foundries, especially for vehicle construction. Wrought alloys are very rare. They are used as a filler metal (welding wire) or as a solder in brazing. In some cases, forged AlSi pistons are also built for aviation. 

AlSi eutectic casting alloys are used for machine parts, cylinder heads, cylinder crankcases, impellers and ribbed bodies. Hypereutectic (high silicon) alloys are used for engine parts because of low thermal expansion and high strength and wear resistance. This also includes special piston alloys with around 25% Si.

Alloys with additions of magnesium (AlSiMg) can be hardened by heat treatment. An example use-case are wheel rims produced by low -pressure casting because of their good strength, corrosion resistance and elongation at break. Alloys with about 10% Si are used for cylinder heads, switch housings, intake manifolds, transformer tanks, wheel suspensions and oil pans. Alloys with 5% Si to 7% Si are used for chassis parts and wheels. At levels of 9%, they are suitable for structural components and body nodes. 

The copper-containing AlSiCu alloys are used for gear housings, crankcases and cylinder heads because of their heat resistance and hardenability. 

In addition to the use of AlSi alloys as a structural material, in which the mechanical properties are paramount, another area of application is latent heat storage. In the phase change of the alloy at 577 °C, thermal energy can be stored in the form of the enthalpy of fusion. AlSi can therefore also be used as a metallic phase change material (mPCM) be used. Compared to other phase change materials, metals are characterized by a high specific energy density combined with high thermal conductivity. The latter is important for the rapid entry and exit of heat in the storage material and thus increases the performance of a heat storage system. These advantageous properties of mPCM such as AlSi are of particular importance for vehicle applications, since low masses and volumes as well as high thermal performance are the main goals here. By using storage systems based on mPCM, the range of electric cars can be increased by thermally storing the necessary thermal energy for heating in the mPCM instead of taking it from the traction battery. 

Almost eutectic AlSi melts are also used for hot-dip aluminizing. In the process of continuous strip galvanizing, steel strips are finished with a heat-resistant metallic coating 10-25 μm thick. Hot-dip aluminized sheet steel is an inexpensive material for thermally stressed components. Unlike zinc coatings, the coating does not provide cathodic protection under atmospheric conditions.

==Characteristics==
* High castability, fluidity, corrosion resistance, ductility, and low density.
* Usable for large castings, which can operate under heavy load conditions.
* Considered to not be a heat-treatable alloy, but the addition of Mg &amp; Cu can allow it to be heat treated, e.g. AΠ4 alloys.
* Strengthened by solution treatment, e.g. adding 0.01% sodium (in the form of sodium fluoride [NaF] and sodium chloride [NaCl]) to the melt just before casting.
* A disadvantage is a tendency for porosity in the casting, i.e. the casting can become foam-like. This can be avoided by casting under pressure in autoclaves.

<text>Hayes is a suburban area of southeast London, England and part of the London Borough of Bromley. It is located south-east of Charing Cross, to the north of Keston and Coney Hall, west of Bromley Common, south of Bromley town centre, and east of West Wickham. An ancient parish in the county of Kent, Hayes was within the Orpington Urban District that became part of Greater London in 1965.

==History==
===The Ancient Village===

The name &quot;Hayes&quot; is recorded from 1177 as &quot;hoese&quot; from the Anglo-Saxon meaning &quot;a settlement in open land overgrown with shrubs and rough bushes&quot;. It formed an ancient, and later civil, parish of Kent of around . The village stood at the junction of Hayes Lane, leading north to Bromley (one mile distant), and what is now known as Pickhurst Lane, leading west to West Wickham; the centre of the old village is now called &quot;Hayes Street&quot;. The village school was here, as is the parish church of St Mary the Virgin. Parts of the church date back to the thirteenth century, however it was subject to heavy restorations by George Gilbert Scott and John Oldrid Scott in the 19th century. The village&#x27;s public house, also on Hayes Street, is called &quot;The George&quot; (first recorded 1759).) Hayes Street Farm, still shown on modern maps, is to the north of the village centre.

Both William Pitt the Elder, 1st Earl of Chatham (1708–1778), and William Pitt the Younger (1759–1806) lived at Hayes Place. The house, which dated back to the 15th century, was demolished in 1933 by the developer Henry Boot and the site redeveloped, but its occupants are remembered in such road names as Chatham and Pittsmead Avenues. Prior to being demolished, Hayes Place was owned by the Hambro family (of Hambros Bank fame) and a couple of roads bear the family names.

Although the parish church of Hayes can trace its history back over 800 years, and locals joined Jack Cade in his rebellion of 1450, the story of modern Hayes begins a little over a century ago, when Hayes became a popular place in which to live with bankers, stockbrokers and other City financiers buying property in the area. Development was aided when the branch railway from Elmers End, originally known as the West Wickham and Hayes Railway, was opened on 29 May 1882. Between 1801, when the population was just 382, and 1921, it had almost tripled to 1,010.

===Modern suburban Hayes===
Throughout the 20th century, the Hayes village area continued to grow and thrive. Further commercial development occurred on Station Approach because the increased traffic through the railway terminus created an incentive for growth. In the old village area (&#x27;Old Hayes&#x27;), the former village school was converted to a church hall when the local primary school opened in 1937; it lies along George Lane, which was further expanded at around the same time to facilitate further suburban housing developments.
To cope with the increase in commuter traffic, the station was rebuilt in 1935, and &quot;Station Approach&quot; became the main shopping area, including a Post Office, petrol station, two mini-supermarkets and numerous small shops. It also contains a public house called The New Inn.

During the Second World War an anti-aircraft gun battery was locally based on Hayes Common, and the soldiers of the 1st Canadian Division who manned it were barracked in local homes. Grandfields Nursery on West Common Road was hit by a V-2 rocket in the late afternoon of 9 February 1945, killing four people, including three members of the Grandfield family. Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church was later built on the site.

Much of the area to the west and north-west of the original village has been taken over by suburbia. West Wickham and Bromley are completely joined with Hayes; and Coney Hall estate, beyond the Orpington - Croydon road is also part of the pattern. To the east and south, however, the open space of Hayes Common precludes building of any kind.

The old village area along Hayes Street, also known as &#x27;Old Hayes&#x27;, today contains some small shops, though the local post office closed in 2004 (the nearest is now in the main shopping area near the station). The timbered cottage on the eastern side of Hayes Street was originally the village bakery, then it became a newsagents called &quot;The Walnut Tree&quot;, until 2006, when it changed to residential use. The former village school remains a second village hall; the local primary school in George Lane has expanded in size in recent years, and now has three class groups in each year. It is extremely popular, and many of its pupils go on to Hayes School in West Common Road.

The shopping area in &quot;Old Hayes&quot; functions as a second hub for commercial businesses, running along Hayes street opposite the church building. It consists of the public house, &quot;The George&quot;, a mini-market, several hairdressers, a cycle shop, two coffee shops and a fish and chip shop. Next to the church is the village public library, part of the Bromley Borough Libraries Service, occupying the old rectory building (since replaced by the new rectory). The library is surrounded by the library gardens, a small area of parkland containing tennis courts. On the north side of the church is Hayes Village Hall, built in 1927 by Hayes Community Council. This was led by Canon Thompson. It remains a hub of Village life.

Hayes Street Farm continues to play an important role in the village setting. Several public pathways and popular walking routes run through the farmland, and regular car boot sales are hosted on the farm fields.

There is a group called Hayes Village Association (HVA) which meet regularly to inform people about local issues. They regularly liaise with Bromley Council on planning matters and they give a voice to residents and businesses on a variety of issues. HVA produce a quarterly magazine with local interest articles and events, as well as details of businesses in the locality.

==Sports and leisure==

<doc id="609733" wikidata="Q65122114" url="?curid=609733" title="Vanilla slice">
<text>Vanilla slice is an Australian pastry comprising a thick layer of vanilla custard sandwiched between puff pastry and topped with icing sugar or thinly iced. Similar varieties of the dessert exist in Europe and North America, and it is believed to have evolved from one of the similar European desserts.

==History==
Vanilla slice is an Australian variation of many similar desserts comprising vanilla custard and flaky pastry. Most notably this includes the &quot;Mille-feuille&quot;, which is believed to have originated in France. Other similar pastries include the Dutch &quot;Tompouce&quot;, Polish &quot;Napoleonka&quot;, German &quot;Cremeschnitte&quot;, Balkan and Middle Eastern &quot;Galaktoboureko&quot;, among others. It is believed that the Australian vanilla slice emerged as a variety of one of these similar desserts, but it is unknown which variety or varieties evolved into the modern vanilla slice.

==Culture==
Vanilla slice is strongly ingrained within Australian &quot;bakery culture&quot;, commonly featuring in bakeries across the nation. In keeping with the informality and disdain for pretence in Australian vernacular, it is common to refer to the dessert using colloquial names based on bodily fluids such as pus, phlegm, or nasal mucus which are similar in appearance to the custard filling. This includes names such as snot block, snot brick, phlegm cake, or pus pie.

To celebrate its cultural significance, an annual competition known as &quot;The Great Australian Vanilla Slice Triumph&quot; has been held since 1998. The event began after Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett visited the Victorian town of Ouyen, and considered the local bakery to make the best vanilla slice in Australia. The event was hosted annually in Ouyen until 2001, when it moved to the nearby town of Merbein.

<doc id="609737" wikidata="Q1755512" url="?curid=609737" title="Duality (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a duality translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures in a one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an involution operation: if the dual of is , then the dual of is . In other cases the dual of the dual – the double dual or bidual – is not necessarily identical to the original (also called &quot;primal&quot;). Such involutions sometimes have fixed points, so that the dual of is itself. For example, Desargues&#x27; theorem is self-dual in this sense under the &quot;standard duality in projective geometry&quot;.

In mathematical contexts, &quot;duality&quot; has numerous meanings. It has been described as &quot;a very pervasive and important concept in (modern) mathematics&quot; and &quot;an important general theme that has manifestations in almost every area of mathematics&quot;.

Many mathematical dualities between objects of two types correspond to pairings, bilinear functions from an object of one type and another object of the second type to some family of scalars. For instance, &quot;linear algebra duality&quot; corresponds in this way to bilinear maps from pairs of vector spaces to scalars, the &quot;duality between distributions and the associated test functions&quot; corresponds to the pairing in which one integrates a distribution against a test function, and &quot;Poincaré duality&quot; corresponds similarly to intersection number, viewed as a pairing between submanifolds of a given manifold.

From a category theory viewpoint, duality can also be seen as a functor, at least in the realm of vector spaces. This functor assigns to each space its dual space, and the pullback construction assigns to each arrow its dual .

== Introductory examples ==
In the words of Michael Atiyah,
The following list of examples shows the common features of many dualities, but also indicates that the precise meaning of duality may vary from case to case.

=== Complement of a subset ===
A simple duality arises from considering subsets of a fixed set . To any subset , the complement consists of all those elements in that are not contained in . It is again a subset of . Taking the complement has the following properties:
* Applying it twice gives back the original set, i.e., . This is referred to by saying that the operation of taking the complement is an &quot;involution&quot;.
* An inclusion of sets is turned into an inclusion in the &quot;opposite&quot; direction .
* Given two subsets and of , is contained in if and only if is contained in .

This duality appears in topology as a duality between open and closed subsets of some fixed topological space : a subset of is closed if and only if its complement in is open. Because of this, many theorems about closed sets are dual to theorems about open sets. For example, any union of open sets is open, so dually, any intersection of closed sets is closed. The interior of a set is the largest open set contained in it, and the closure of the set is the smallest closed set that contains it. Because of the duality, the complement of the interior of any set is equal to the closure of the complement of .

=== Dual cone ===

A duality in geometry is provided by the dual cone construction. Given a set formula_1 of points in the plane formula_2 (or more generally points in the dual cone is defined as the set formula_3 consisting of those points formula_4 satisfying
formula_5
for all points formula_6 in formula_1, as illustrated in the diagram.
Unlike for the complement of sets mentioned above, it is not in general true that applying the dual cone construction twice gives back the original set formula_1. Instead, formula_9 is the smallest cone containing formula_1 which may be bigger than formula_1. Therefore this duality is weaker than the one above, in that
* Applying the operation twice gives back a possibly bigger set: for all formula_1, formula_1 is contained in formula_9. (For some formula_1, namely the cones, the two are actually equal.)
The other two properties carry over without change:
* It is still true that an inclusion formula_16 is turned into an inclusion in the opposite direction (formula_17).
* Given two subsets formula_1 and formula_19 of the plane, formula_1 is contained in formula_21 if and only if formula_19 is contained in formula_23.

=== Dual vector space ===
A very important example of a duality arises in linear algebra by associating to any vector space its dual vector space . Its elements are the linear functionals formula_24, where is the field over which is defined.
The three properties of the dual cone carry over to this type of duality by replacing subsets of formula_2 by vector space and inclusions of such subsets by linear maps. That is:
* Applying the operation of taking the dual vector space twice gives another vector space . There is always a map . For some , namely precisely the finite-dimensional vector spaces, this map is an isomorphism. 
* A linear map gives rise to a map in the opposite direction ().
* Given two vector spaces and , the maps from to correspond to the maps from to .
A particular feature of this duality is that and are isomorphic for certain objects, namely finite-dimensional vector spaces. However, this is in a sense a lucky coincidence, for giving such an isomorphism requires a certain choice, for example the choice of a basis of . This is also true in the case if is a Hilbert space, &quot;via&quot; the Riesz representation theorem.

=== Galois theory ===

In all the dualities discussed before, the dual of an object is of the same kind as the object itself. For example, the dual of a vector space is again a vector space. Many duality statements are not of this kind. Instead, such dualities reveal a close relation between objects of seemingly different nature. One example of such a more general duality is from Galois theory. For a fixed Galois extension , one may associate the Galois group to any intermediate field (i.e., ). This group is a subgroup of the Galois group . Conversely, to any such subgroup there is the fixed field consisting of elements fixed by the elements in .

Compared to the above, this duality has the following features:
* An extension of intermediate fields gives rise to an inclusion of Galois groups in the opposite direction: .
* Associating to and to are inverse to each other. This is the content of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.

== Order-reversing dualities ==
Given a poset (short for partially ordered set; i.e., a set that has a notion of ordering but in which two elements cannot necessarily be placed in order relative to each other), the dual poset comprises the same ground set but the converse relation. Familiar examples of dual partial orders include
* the subset and superset relations and on any collection of sets, such as the subsets of a fixed set . This gives rise to the first example of a duality mentioned above.
* the &quot;divides&quot; and &quot;multiple-of&quot; relations on the integers.
* the &quot;descendant-of&quot; and &quot;ancestor-of&quot; relations on the set of humans.

A &quot;duality transform&quot; is an involutive antiautomorphism of a partially ordered set , that is, an order-reversing involution . In several important cases these simple properties determine the transform uniquely up to some simple symmetries. For example, if , are two duality transforms then their composition is an order automorphism of ; thus, any two duality transforms differ only by an order automorphism. For example, all order automorphisms of a power set are induced by permutations of .

A concept defined for a partial order will correspond to a &quot;dual concept&quot; on the dual poset . For instance, a minimal element of will be a maximal element of : minimality and maximality are dual concepts in order theory. Other pairs of dual concepts are upper and lower bounds, lower sets and upper sets, and ideals and filters.

In topology, open sets and closed sets are dual concepts: the complement of an open set is closed, and vice versa. In matroid theory, the family of sets complementary to the independent sets of a given matroid themselves form another matroid, called the dual matroid.

== Dimension-reversing dualities ==

There are many distinct but interrelated dualities in which geometric or topological objects correspond to other objects of the same type, but with a reversal of the dimensions of the features of the objects. A classical example of this is the duality of the Platonic solids, in which the cube and the octahedron form a dual pair, the dodecahedron and the icosahedron form a dual pair, and the tetrahedron is self-dual. The dual polyhedron of any of these polyhedra may be formed as the convex hull of the center points of each face of the primal polyhedron, so the vertices of the dual correspond one-for-one with the faces of the primal. Similarly, each edge of the dual corresponds to an edge of the primal, and each face of the dual corresponds to a vertex of the primal. These correspondences are incidence-preserving: if two parts of the primal polyhedron touch each other, so do the corresponding two parts of the dual polyhedron. More generally, using the concept of polar reciprocation, any convex polyhedron, or more generally any convex polytope, corresponds to a dual polyhedron or dual polytope, with an -dimensional feature of an -dimensional polytope corresponding to an -dimensional feature of the dual polytope. The incidence-preserving nature of the duality is reflected in the fact that the face lattices of the primal and dual polyhedra or polytopes are themselves order-theoretic duals. Duality of polytopes and order-theoretic duality are both involutions: the dual polytope of the dual polytope of any polytope is the original polytope, and reversing all order-relations twice returns to the original order. Choosing a different center of polarity leads to geometrically different dual polytopes, but all have the same combinatorial structure.
From any three-dimensional polyhedron, one can form a planar graph, the graph of its vertices and edges. The dual polyhedron has a dual graph, a graph with one vertex for each face of the polyhedron and with one edge for every two adjacent faces. The same concept of planar graph duality may be generalized to graphs that are drawn in the plane but that do not come from a three-dimensional polyhedron, or more generally to graph embeddings on surfaces of higher genus: one may draw a dual graph by placing one vertex within each region bounded by a cycle of edges in the embedding, and drawing an edge connecting any two regions that share a boundary edge. An important example of this type comes from computational geometry: the duality for any finite set of points in the plane between the Delaunay triangulation of and the Voronoi diagram of . As with dual polyhedra and dual polytopes, the duality of graphs on surfaces is a dimension-reversing involution: each vertex in the primal embedded graph corresponds to a region of the dual embedding, each edge in the primal is crossed by an edge in the dual, and each region of the primal corresponds to a vertex of the dual. The dual graph depends on how the primal graph is embedded: different planar embeddings of a single graph may lead to different dual graphs. Matroid duality is an algebraic extension of planar graph duality, in the sense that the dual matroid of the graphic matroid of a planar graph is isomorphic to the graphic matroid of the dual graph.

A kind of geometric duality also occurs in optimization theory, but not one that reverses dimensions. A linear program may be specified by a system of real variables (the coordinates for a point in Euclidean space a system of linear constraints (specifying that the point lie in a halfspace; the intersection of these halfspaces is a convex polytope, the feasible region of the program), and a linear function (what to optimize). Every linear program has a dual problem with the same optimal solution, but the variables in the dual problem correspond to constraints in the primal problem and vice versa.
== Duality in logic and set theory ==
In logic, functions or relations and are considered dual if , where ¬ is logical negation. The basic duality of this type is the duality of the ∃ and ∀ quantifiers in classical logic. These are dual because and are equivalent for all predicates in classical logic: if there exists an for which fails to hold, then it is false that holds for all (but the converse does not hold constructively). From this fundamental logical duality follow several others:
* A formula is said to be &quot;satisfiable&quot; in a certain model if there are assignments to its free variables that render it true; it is &quot;valid&quot; if &quot;every&quot; assignment to its free variables makes it true. Satisfiability and validity are dual because the invalid formulas are precisely those whose negations are satisfiable, and the unsatisfiable formulas are those whose negations are valid. This can be viewed as a special case of the previous item, with the quantifiers ranging over interpretations.
* In classical logic, the and operators are dual in this sense, because and are equivalent. This means that for every theorem of classical logic there is an equivalent dual theorem. De Morgan&#x27;s laws are examples. More generally, . The left side is true if and only if , and the right side if and only if ¬∃&quot;i&quot;.&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;.
* In modal logic, means that the proposition is &quot;necessarily&quot; true, and that is &quot;possibly&quot; true. Most interpretations of modal logic assign dual meanings to these two operators. For example in Kripke semantics, &quot; is possibly true&quot; means &quot;there exists some world such that is true in &quot;, while &quot; is necessarily true&quot; means &quot;for all worlds , is true in &quot;. The duality of and then follows from the analogous duality of and . Other dual modal operators behave similarly. For example, temporal logic has operators denoting &quot;will be true at some time in the future&quot; and &quot;will be true at all times in the future&quot; which are similarly dual.

Other analogous dualities follow from these:
* Set-theoretic union and intersection are dual under the set complement operator . That is, , and more generally, . This follows from the duality of and : an element is a member of if and only if , and is a member of if and only if .

== Bidual ==
The dual of the dual, called the bidual or double dual, depending on context, is often identical to the original (also called &quot;primal&quot;), and duality is an involution. In this case the bidual is not usually distinguished, and instead one only refers to the primal and dual. For example, the dual poset of the dual poset is exactly the original poset, since the converse relation is defined by an involution.

In other cases, the bidual is not identical with the primal, though there is often a close connection. For example, the dual cone of the dual cone of a set contains the primal set (it is the smallest cone containing the primal set), and is equal if and only if the primal set is a cone.

An important case is for vector spaces, where there is a map from the primal space to the double dual, , known as the &quot;canonical evaluation map&quot;. For finite-dimensional vector spaces this is an isomorphism, but these are not identical spaces: they are different sets. In category theory, this is generalized by , and a &quot;natural transformation&quot; from the identity functor to the double dual functor. For vector spaces (considered algebraically), this is always an injection; see . This can be generalized algebraically to a dual module. There is still a canonical evaluation map, but it is not always injective; if it is, this is known as a torsionless module; if it is an isomophism, the module is called reflexive.

For topological vector spaces (including normed vector spaces), there is a separate notion of a topological dual, denoted to distinguish from the algebraic dual , with different possible topologies on the dual, each of which defines a different bidual space . In these cases the canonical evaluation map is not in general an isomorphism. If it is, this is known (for certain locally convex vector spaces with the strong dual space topology) as a reflexive space.

In other cases, showing a relation between the primal and bidual is a significant result, as in Pontryagin duality (a locally compact abelian group is naturally isomorphic to its bidual).

== Dual objects ==
A group of dualities can be described by endowing, for any mathematical object , the set of morphisms into some fixed object , with a structure similar to that of . This is sometimes called internal Hom. In general, this yields a true duality only for specific choices of , in which case is referred to as the &quot;dual&quot; of . There is always a map from to the &quot;bidual&quot;, that is to say, the dual of the dual,
formula_26
It assigns to some the map that associates to any map (i.e., an element in ) the value .
Depending on the concrete duality considered and also depending on the object , this map may or may not be an isomorphism.

=== Dual vector spaces revisited ===
The construction of the dual vector space
formula_27
mentioned in the introduction is an example of such a duality. Indeed, the set of morphisms, i.e., linear maps, forms a vector space in its own right. The map mentioned above is always injective. It is surjective, and therefore an isomorphism, if and only if the dimension of is finite. This fact characterizes finite-dimensional vector spaces without referring to a basis.

==== Isomorphisms of and and inner product spaces ====
A vector space is isomorphic to precisely if is finite-dimensional. In this case, such an isomorphism is equivalent to a non-degenerate bilinear form
formula_28
In this case is called an inner product space.
For example, if is the field of real or complex numbers, any positive definite bilinear form gives rise to such an isomorphism. In Riemannian geometry, is taken to be the tangent space of a manifold and such positive bilinear forms are called Riemannian metrics. Their purpose is to measure angles and distances. Thus, duality is a foundational basis of this branch of geometry. Another application of inner product spaces is the Hodge star which provides a correspondence between the elements of the exterior algebra. For an -dimensional vector space, the Hodge star operator maps -forms to -forms. This can be used to formulate Maxwell&#x27;s equations. In this guise, the duality inherent in the inner product space exchanges the role of magnetic and electric fields.

==== Duality in projective geometry ====
In some projective planes, it is possible to find geometric transformations that map each point of the projective plane to a line, and each line of the projective plane to a point, in an incidence-preserving way. For such planes there arises a general principle of duality in projective planes: given any theorem in such a plane projective geometry, exchanging the terms &quot;point&quot; and &quot;line&quot; everywhere results in a new, equally valid theorem. A simple example is that the statement &quot;two points determine a unique line, the line passing through these points&quot; has the dual statement that &quot;two lines determine a unique point, the intersection point of these two lines&quot;. For further examples, see Dual theorems.

A conceptual explanation of this phenomenon in some planes (notably field planes) is offered by the dual vector space. In fact, the points in the projective plane formula_29 correspond to one-dimensional subvector spaces formula_30 while the lines in the projective plane correspond to subvector spaces formula_31 of dimension 2. The duality in such projective geometries stems from assigning to a one-dimensional formula_32 the subspace of formula_33 consisting of those linear maps formula_34 which satisfy formula_35. As a consequence of the dimension formula of linear algebra, this space is two-dimensional, i.e., it corresponds to a line in the projective plane associated to formula_33.

The (positive definite) bilinear form
formula_37
yields an identification of this projective plane with the formula_29. Concretely, the duality assigns to formula_30 its orthogonal formula_40. The explicit formulas in duality in projective geometry arise by means of this identification.

=== Topological vector spaces and Hilbert spaces ===
In the realm of topological vector spaces, a similar construction exists, replacing the dual by the topological dual vector space. There are several notions of topological dual space, and each of them gives rise to a certain concept of duality. A topological vector space formula_41 that is canonically isomorphic to its bidual formula_42 is called a reflexive space:
formula_43

Examples:
* As in the finite-dimensional case, on each Hilbert space its inner product defines a map formula_44 which is a bijection due to the Riesz representation theorem. As a corollary, every Hilbert space is a reflexive Banach space.
* The dual normed space of an -space is where provided that , but the dual of is bigger than . Hence is not reflexive.
* Distributions are linear functionals on appropriate spaces of functions. They are an important technical means in the theory of partial differential equations (PDE): instead of solving a PDE directly, it may be easier to first solve the PDE in the &quot;weak sense&quot;, i.e., find a distribution that satisfies the PDE and, second, to show that the solution must, in fact, be a function. All the standard spaces of distributions — formula_45, formula_46, formula_47 — are reflexive locally convex spaces.

=== Further dual objects ===
The dual lattice of a lattice is given by
formula_48
the set of linear functions on the real vector space containing the lattice that map the points of the lattice to the integers formula_49. This is used in the construction of toric varieties. The Pontryagin dual of locally compact topological groups &quot;G&quot; is given by
formula_50
continuous group homomorphisms with values in the circle (with multiplication of complex numbers as group operation).

== Dual categories ==
=== Opposite category and adjoint functors ===
In another group of dualities, the objects of one theory are translated into objects of another theory and the maps between objects in the first theory are translated into morphisms in the second theory, but with direction reversed. Using the parlance of category theory, this amounts to a contravariant functor between two categories and :

which for any two objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;C&quot; gives a map

That functor may or may not be an equivalence of categories. There are various situations, where such a functor is an equivalence between the opposite category of , and . Using a duality of this type, every statement in the first theory can be translated into a &quot;dual&quot; statement in the second theory, where the direction of all arrows has to be reversed. Therefore, any duality between categories and is formally the same as an equivalence between and ( and ). However, in many circumstances the opposite categories have no inherent meaning, which makes duality an additional, separate concept.

A category that is equivalent to its dual is called &quot;self-dual&quot;. An example of self-dual category is the category of Hilbert spaces.

Many category-theoretic notions come in pairs in the sense that they correspond to each other while considering the opposite category. For example, Cartesian products and disjoint unions of sets are dual to each other in the sense that

and

for any set . This is a particular case of a more general duality phenomenon, under which limits in a category correspond to colimits in the opposite category ; further concrete examples of this are epimorphisms vs. monomorphism, in particular factor modules (or groups etc.) vs. submodules, direct products vs. direct sums (also called coproducts to emphasize the duality aspect). Therefore, in some cases, proofs of certain statements can be halved, using such a duality phenomenon. Further notions displaying related by such a categorical duality are projective and injective modules in homological algebra, fibrations and cofibrations in topology and more generally model categories.

Two functors and are adjoint if for all objects &quot;c&quot; in &quot;C&quot; and &quot;d&quot; in &quot;D&quot;

in a natural way. Actually, the correspondence of limits and colimits is an example of adjoints, since there is an adjunction

between the colimit functor that assigns to any diagram in indexed by some category its colimit and the diagonal functor that maps any object of to the constant diagram which has at all places. Dually,
=== Spaces and functions ===

Gelfand duality is a duality between commutative C*-algebras &quot;A&quot; and compact Hausdorff spaces &quot;X&quot; is the same: it assigns to &quot;X&quot; the space of continuous functions (which vanish at infinity) from &quot;X&quot; to C, the complex numbers. Conversely, the space &quot;X&quot; can be reconstructed from &quot;A&quot; as the spectrum of &quot;A&quot;. Both Gelfand and Pontryagin duality can be deduced in a largely formal, category-theoretic way.

In a similar vein there is a duality in algebraic geometry between commutative rings and affine schemes: to every commutative ring &quot;A&quot; there is an affine spectrum, Spec &quot;A&quot;. Conversely, given an affine scheme &quot;S&quot;, one gets back a ring by taking global sections of the structure sheaf O&quot;S&quot;. In addition, ring homomorphisms are in one-to-one correspondence with morphisms of affine schemes, thereby there is an equivalence
: (Commutative rings)op ≅ (affine schemes)
Affine schemes are the local building blocks of schemes. The previous result therefore tells that the local theory of schemes is the same as commutative algebra, the study of commutative rings.

Noncommutative geometry draws inspiration from Gelfand duality and studies noncommutative C*-algebras as if they were functions on some imagined space. Tannaka–Krein duality is a non-commutative analogue of Pontryagin duality.

=== Galois connections ===
In a number of situations, the two categories which are dual to each other are actually arising from partially ordered sets, i.e., there is some notion of an object &quot;being smaller&quot; than another one. A duality that respects the orderings in question is known as a Galois connection. An example is the standard duality in Galois theory mentioned in the introduction: a bigger field extension corresponds—under the mapping that assigns to any extension &quot;L&quot; ⊃ &quot;K&quot; (inside some fixed bigger field Ω) the Galois group Gal (Ω / &quot;L&quot;) —to a smaller group.

The collection of all open subsets of a topological space &quot;X&quot; forms a complete Heyting algebra. There is a duality, known as Stone duality, connecting sober spaces and spatial locales.
* Birkhoff&#x27;s representation theorem relating distributive lattices and partial orders

=== Pontryagin duality ===
Pontryagin duality gives a duality on the category of locally compact abelian groups: given any such group &quot;G&quot;, the character group
: &quot;χ&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) = Hom (&quot;G&quot;, &quot;S&quot;1)
given by continuous group homomorphisms from &quot;G&quot; to the circle group &quot;S&quot;1 can be endowed with the compact-open topology. Pontryagin duality states that the character group is again locally compact abelian and that
: &quot;G&quot; ≅ &quot;χ&quot;(&quot;χ&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)).
Moreover, discrete groups correspond to compact abelian groups; finite groups correspond to finite groups. On the one hand, Pontryagin is a special case of Gelfand duality. On the other hand, it is the conceptual reason of Fourier analysis, see below.

== Analytic dualities ==
In analysis, problems are frequently solved by passing to the dual description of functions and operators.

Fourier transform switches between functions on a vector space and its dual:
formula_51
and conversely
formula_52
If &quot;f&quot; is an &quot;L&quot;2-function on R or R&quot;N&quot;, say, then so is formula_53 and formula_54. Moreover, the transform interchanges operations of multiplication and convolution on the corresponding function spaces. A conceptual explanation of the Fourier transform is obtained by the aforementioned Pontryagin duality, applied to the locally compact groups R (or R&quot;N&quot; etc.): any character of R is given by &quot;ξ&quot; ↦ &quot;e&quot;−2&quot;πixξ&quot;. The dualizing character of Fourier transform has many other manifestations, for example, in alternative descriptions of quantum mechanical systems in terms of coordinate and momentum representations.
* Laplace transform is similar to Fourier transform and interchanges operators of multiplication by polynomials with constant coefficient linear differential operators.
* Legendre transformation is an important analytic duality which switches between velocities in Lagrangian mechanics and momenta in Hamiltonian mechanics.

==Homology and cohomology==
Theorems showing that certain objects of interest are the dual spaces (in the sense of linear algebra) of other objects of interest are often called &quot;dualities&quot;. Many of these dualities are given by a bilinear pairing of two &quot;K&quot;-vector spaces
: &quot;A&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot; → &quot;K&quot;.
For perfect pairings, there is, therefore, an isomorphism of &quot;A&quot; to the dual of &quot;B&quot;.

=== Poincaré duality ===
Poincaré duality of a smooth compact complex manifold &quot;X&quot; is given by a pairing of singular cohomology with C-coefficients (equivalently, sheaf cohomology of the constant sheaf C)
: H&quot;i&quot;(X) ⊗ H2&quot;n&quot;−&quot;i&quot;(X) → C,
where &quot;n&quot; is the (complex) dimension of &quot;X&quot;. Poincaré duality can also be expressed as a relation of singular homology and de Rham cohomology, by asserting that the map
: formula_55
(integrating a differential &quot;k&quot;-form over a (2&quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot;)-(real-)dimensional cycle) is a perfect pairing.

Poincaré duality also reverses dimensions; it corresponds to the fact that, if a topological manifold is represented as a cell complex, then the dual of the complex (a higher-dimensional generalization of the planar graph dual) represents the same manifold. In Poincaré duality, this homeomorphism is reflected in an isomorphism of the &quot;k&quot;th homology group and the (&quot;n&quot; − &quot;k&quot;)th cohomology group.

=== Duality in algebraic and arithmetic geometry ===
The same duality pattern holds for a smooth projective variety over a separably closed field, using l-adic cohomology with Qℓ-coefficients instead. This is further generalized to possibly singular varieties, using intersection cohomology instead, a duality called Verdier duality. Serre duality or coherent duality are similar to the statements above, but applies to cohomology of coherent sheaves instead.

With increasing level of generality, it turns out, an increasing amount of technical background is helpful or necessary to understand these theorems: the modern formulation of these dualities can be done using derived categories and certain direct and inverse image functors of sheaves (with respect to the classical analytical topology on manifolds for Poincaré duality, l-adic sheaves and the étale topology in the second case, and with respect to coherent sheaves for coherent duality).

Yet another group of similar duality statements is encountered in arithmetics: étale cohomology of finite, local and global fields (also known as Galois cohomology, since étale cohomology over a field is equivalent to group cohomology of the (absolute) Galois group of the field) admit similar pairings. The absolute Galois group &quot;G&quot;(F&quot;q&quot;) of a finite field, for example, is isomorphic to formula_56, the profinite completion of Z, the integers. Therefore, the perfect pairing (for any &quot;G&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;)
: H&quot;n&quot;(&quot;G&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) × H1−&quot;n&quot; (&quot;G&quot;, Hom (&quot;M&quot;, Q/Z)) → Q/Z
is a direct consequence of Pontryagin duality of finite groups. For local and global fields, similar statements exist (local duality and global or Poitou–Tate duality).

<text>Winston Hsiao-tzu Chang (; 1 March 1942 – 24 February 1996) was a president of Soochow University in Taipei.

==Biography==
He and his identical twin brother, John Chang, were born the sons of Chiang Ching-kuo and Chang Ya-juo maybe at what is now Second People&#x27;s Hospital in Guilin. As they were born out of wedlock, they took their mother&#x27;s surname (although both were given the generation name of &quot;Hsiao&quot; shared by all of Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s children, (legitimate or otherwise). Chang Ya-juo died when the brothers were infants in August 1942, and they were raised by Chang Ya-juo&#x27;s younger brother, Chang Hau-juo (章浩若) and his wife Chi Chen (紀琛). Their uncle and aunt were listed as their parents on official documents until December 2002.

The brothers fled to Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1949 and both studied law in Soochow University. Winston Chang received his master&#x27;s from Southern Methodist University, and his doctorate from Tulane University Law School. After returning to Taiwan, he was mostly involved in teaching and research. He later became the chairman of the Soochow University College of Law as well as the president in 1992.

On 20 August 1993, Chang visited his mother&#x27;s tomb in Guilin and attended a cross-straits Buddhist conference. In late 1994, Chang suffered a stroke (eventually causing his death) in Beijing and entered into a coma. He was flown back to Taiwan via Hong Kong in his comatose condition. Despite the fact that he never recovered from the coma, he continued to officially serve as president on medical leave until his death two years later.

With Chao Chung-te (趙申德), Chang had a son, Ching-sung (勁松), and a daughter, Yu-chu (友菊).

<doc id="609743" wikidata="Q2629820" url="?curid=609743" title="Terminal Spirit Disease">
<text>Terminal Spirit Disease is the third album by Swedish melodic death metal band At the Gates. It was released in 1994 (see 1994 in music) and re-released in 2003 with bonus tracks. It is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Martin Larsson who replaced Alf Svensson in 1993. The band originally had wanted to record an EP of new material, but their label had insisted on a full-length album. To compromise, the band added several live tracks to pad the overall length.

==Background information==
Guitarist Anders Björler commented that he couldn&#x27;t &quot;remember much&quot; from the recording sessions for &quot;Terminal Spirit Disease&quot;. When compared to at the Gates&#x27; older material, Björler felt the tracks &quot;were simpler and more to the point&quot;. A violin and cello are featured on the song &quot;And the World Returned&quot;, cited as an example of the group&#x27;s attempt to explore &quot;ideas which were a little different&quot;.

==Reception==

Reviews for &quot;Terminal Spirit Disease&quot; have been mostly positive. AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia awards the album four out of five stars, and claims that, with this album, &quot;At the Gates raised their creative stakes beyond most everyone&#x27;s original expectations, and proved that what had once been a pretty standard and uninventive death metal combo was slowly becoming a true contender in the scene.&quot; In a retrospective review, Richard Street-Jammer of &quot;Invisible Oranges&quot; called the album &quot;the last record before they became legends&quot; and &quot;a fetish for crummy metalcore.&quot;

The album was inducted into &quot;Decibel&quot; &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; in March 2023.

==Track listing==
The digipak reissue released in 2003 includes three additional live tracks from the 1993 live-in-studio session for MTV Europe:

<doc id="609748" wikidata="Q864918" url="?curid=609748" title="Brock (Pokémon)">
<text>Brock, known as in Japan, is a fictional character in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise owned by Nintendo. In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video games, he is the Gym Leader of Pewter City in the Kanto region and mainly uses Rock-type Pokémon. In the anime series, Ash first battles him and then invites Brock to accompany him on his journey so that Brock can become a Pokémon breeder. He exited the series at some point, replaced by Tracey Sketchit, due to worries that people may find him to be a racial stereotype due to his thin eyes. However, when the company noticed that no one complained, they reintroduced him. He has generally been well-received, with fans of the anime happy whenever he is brought back into the series.

==Concept and creation==

Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series began in Japan in 1996 with the release of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; for the Game Boy. In these games, the player assumes the role of a Pokémon Trainer whose goal is to capture and train creatures called Pokémon. Players use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon, and some can transform into stronger species, or evolve. The ultimate goal is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain creatures from all Pokémon species.

Designed by Ken Sugimori as a &quot;gym leader&quot;, a Pokémon trainer that acts as an area boss, Brock was introduced in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. Due to the nature of the game&#x27;s development, only one set of concept sketches was done before implementing the character as sprite art within the game. Originally intended to be the game&#x27;s second gym leader battle, Brock was changed to be the first instead for the game&#x27;s final release. To illustrate that Brock rarely smiles, Sugimori drew him with his eyes always closed, something he considered a rare decision.

For the anime, Brock was designed by Atsuko Nishida. In the anime, Brock was one of the companions to protagonist Ash Ketchum. However, he was eventually replaced with the character Tracey Sketchit. His removal was controversial, leading to fan outcry that caused him to be reintroduced to the anime. Despite them noting that they like to change up the cast in general, it was also clarified that they were worried that fans may perceive Brock as a racist stereotype by Americans, namely due to his thin eyes. This was a worry they had since the beginning of the series, and while there were no complaints, they anticipated controversy. Furthermore, the company specifically included Tracey, wanting to include a &quot;tall, Anglo-Saxon looking person to be on the safe side.&quot; They ultimately decided to introduce Brock again due to the lack of complaints and their personal affinity for him. He has since been one of the most recurring characters in the show.

Brock was voiced in Japanese by Yūji Ueda in the Pokemon anime and by Eric Stuart in English. He has been voiced by other actors in later Pokemon anime and games. Bill Rogers voiced Brock in later English episodes. In &quot;Pokemon Origins&quot;, he was voiced by Tomokazu Sugita in Japanese and Johnny Yong Bosch in English. In the video game &quot;Pokémon Masters&quot;, he is voiced by Kōsuke Toriumi in Japanese and by Tommy Arciniega. He was also portrayed by Dennis Kenney in &quot;Pokemon Live!&quot;.

==Appearances==
===In the video games===
Brock is the Gym Leader of Pewter City in the fictional region of Kanto. He specializes in Rock-type Pokémon, and the player may battle him in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, as well as subsequent remakes of both. He also appears as an opponent in &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot;. Brock, along with Misty and Blue, return in &quot;Pokémon Black 2&quot; and &quot;White 2&quot; as tournament opponents. Alongside his Onix, Brock also appears as a sync pair in &quot;Pokémon Masters EX&quot; near the beginning of the game.

===In the anime===
In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, Brock aspires to be the greatest Pokémon breeder, but remains as the Pewter City Gym Leader to take care of his nine siblings. After he is defeated by Ash, he gives Ash the badge, despite Ash thinking he didn&#x27;t deserve it. Brock ultimately joins Ash so that he can pursue his dream of being a Pokémon breeder. He eventually leaves his friends in the Orange Islands series to join Professor Felina Ivy, who he is attracted to, and was replaced by Tracey Sketchit. Brock eventually rejoins Ash, having left Ivy for unknown reasons, and travels with him and Misty to Johto. Since then, he has departed and reunited with Ash and others in Hoenn and Sinnoh. He is largely absent after this until the &quot;Sun &amp; Moon&quot; series, where he gets a pair of episodes. Brock later appears in two more episodes of the &quot;Sun &amp; Moon&quot; series when he reunites with Ash in Alola. He makes a guest appearance in &quot;Pokémon Ultimate Journeys: The Series&quot; during the final episodes of Ash&#x27;s journey.

==Promotion and reception==
Brock has received multiple pieces of merchandise. A figure based on his depiction in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; was released as part of the &quot;Next VENDOR&#x27;S Innovation&quot; series. He was also included as part of Megahouse&#x27;s &quot;G.E.M.&quot; series of figures. A yearly tradition of modifying the statue of a man named Hikoichi Orita (at Kyoto University after it was repeatedly vandalized in the 1990s) lead to a modification being made to depict Brock, among other characters, instead. He was chosen as part of a trend, where the focus became featuring supporting characters from popular works.

Brock has been generally well-received, identified as an &quot;unforgettable&quot; character by &quot;IGN&quot;. The book &quot;The Japanification of Children&#x27;s Popular Culture&quot; described Brock&#x27;s portrayal in the anime as a mentor figure, providing an authoritative voice for Ash in the series. It additionally noted him as representing the concept of early maturity in Japanese stories, in his acceptance of a position of independence and his strong interest in women. The book &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon&quot; cited him as a heavily popular character in the United States, with boys identifying themselves with the character and expressing a desire to be &quot;friends with characters that are known to be good or considerate friends&quot;. The book additionally noted a contrast to other characters in the series, in that Brock is drawn with &quot;thinly drawn eyes and slightly darker skin tone&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; writer Brian Shea felt he served as a &quot;litmus test&quot; to measure a trainer&#x27;s ability early on, while &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer felt he was a difficult battle for people who picked Charmander in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, and also people who played &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot;, due to Pikachu&#x27;s weakness to his Pokémon.

His removal from the anime was criticized by fans. Brock&#x27;s reintroduction in the &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot; anime was met with a lot of attention on Twitter, which &quot;ITmedia&quot; staff identified as indicative of his popularity. &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Brian Ashcraft noted the negative fan reaction to the removal of Brock and Misty from &quot;Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!&quot;, particularly since the story is an adaptation of the original story that featured Brock and Misty. The removal of Brock, whose skin is darker, also had fans concerned for the lack of skin color diversity. Fellow &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Kenneth Shepard wrote that, despite Ash having other companions, ending the series by reuniting Ash with his original companions Brock and Misty was fitting. Brock also served as an inspiration for baby names, leading to a rise in the use of the name Brock.

<doc id="609750" wikidata="Q1128811" url="?curid=609750" title="Lincoln Continental Mark V">
<text>The Continental Mark V is a personal luxury coupe marketed in North America by the Lincoln division of Ford Motor Company for model years 1977–1979. It was the third generation of the Mark Series that first began with the 1969 Continental Mark III. At in length, it was the longest two-door coupe Ford has ever marketed.

The Continental Mark V was assembled alongside the Lincoln Continental at Wixom Assembly (1957–2007), and were offered in several commemorative and designer editions; notable examples include the Diamond Jubilee Edition that was available in 1978 and the Bill Blass edition that was sold throughout the Mark V&#x27;s three-year production run.

For 1980, the Mark V was replaced by the significantly downsized Continental Mark VI.

==Chassis==
The Continental Mark V shares its chassis with its predecessor, the Continental Mark IV, with curb weight reduced from 5000 to 4600 pounds.

In the interest of fuel economy, the 1977 Continental Mark V was equipped with a 400 cubic-inch V8. This engine was shared with the Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar and Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis. Outside of California, the 460 V8 remained available as an option. In 1979, the dual-exhaust version of the 400 was discontinued; the 460 was discontinued in the Mark V (and in all Lincolns) by 1980.

The Ford C6 three-speed automatic was the only transmission offered.

==Body==

The exterior design of the Mark V began life in the late 1960s, as an alternative design proposal for what would become the Continental Mark IV. During development, engineers intended for the vehicle to use especially wide Michelin tires, leading to an increase in the flare of the wheel openings, which remained even though the wider tires were deleted from the development program.

In Mark-series tradition, the Mark V retained the faux &quot;spare tire&quot; decklid (marketed as the &quot;Continental&quot; decklid), oval opera windows, hidden headlights, and a radiator-style grille. The front fenders were given functional louvers behind the front wheels. In a style similar to the Mark III, the Mark V was designed with vertical blade taillights. During its development, stylists tested taillights that curved into the top of the rear fender blades, which failed to gain approval of the focus clinics.

While technically a $187 option, all Mark Vs were fitted with a vinyl roof unless specified otherwise. For the 1979 year model, the vinyl roof could no longer be deleted.

Previously standard issue on Marks III and IV, Ford&#x27;s 7.5-liter (460 cid) V8 was optional for 1977, as a smaller 6.6 L (400 cid) V8 became standard. The 7.5 L V8 was not available at all on Mark V in the state of California, as it could not meet that state&#x27;s tougher EPA certification standards. For 1977 only, California-bound Mark Vs were offered with the newly optional turbine-style aluminum wheels as standard equipment, to compensate for the missing engine option.

Also, 1977 was the first year since 1960 that a Mark-series model came with an all-metal, body-color painted (non-vinyl covered) roof as standard equipment. The full-vinyl roof – previously standard on Mark IV - was now optional, as was the rear-quarter Landau roof. The Givenchy Designer Series featured a forward-placed vinyl roof for all model years.

Mark IV&#x27;s successful Designer Series Editions continued with revised color combinations on the new Mark V, as well as revised Luxury Group Option color trim packages. First available in mid-1975, as the &quot;Versailles Option&quot;, a renamed-for-1977 &quot;Majestic Velour Luxury Group&quot; carried over to the Mark V - for 1977 only (minus the upper door trim panel wood-tone moldings - which were on Mark IV with the Versailles option). The returning Gold/Cream and new Cordovan Luxury Groups came with an available unique (small block pattern) &quot;Romano Velour&quot; on the seat pillow inserts and matching upper door panel inserts.

The optional Spring Luxury Group came with either Dove Grey (1N) or Dark Blue Metallic (3G) exterior paint, a choice of Dove Grey or Dark Blue for the vinyl roof color, bodyside molding color, and paint stripe color — and a standard two-tone, Dove Grey and Dark Blue, leather interior.

Luxury wheel covers, dating to the 1972 Mark IV, were carryover as standard on all Mark Vs, except for Designer Series models. The Mark IV-era forged aluminum wheels were optional, as would new-for-1977 alloy wheels with machined wheel lip and spoke edges with argent grey accent paint between the spokes and bright, cup-style metal center caps. These were standard on Designer Series models.

Standard tires in all three years were Michelin (225-15) steel-belted radials with a narrow white sidewall design. First optional in 1975, and remaining so through the end of the 1979 model year, were Goodyear&#x27;s LR78-15&quot; Custom Polysteel radials, in a dual band wide whitewall design. An inflatable spare tire with a pressurized propellant canister replaced the standard conventional full-size spare in 1977. Regardless of any exterior wheel option selected, the standard, conventional spare tire would be of either Michelin or Goodyear brand (matching the vehicle&#x27;s four exterior tires) but would be mounted on a 15-inch conventional steel wheel.

An optional Illuminated Entry System became available in 1977, featuring a 25-second delay to the interior courtesy lights and door lock cylinder rings (activated by lifting either exterior door handle).

===1978===
A larger radiator, heater core inlets, and hoses were new, for improved coolant flow and heater performance. Door lock cylinders and ignition lock switches were revised. The standard 6.6 L (400 cid) V8 engine was slightly detuned, and the 7.5 L V8 was available.

A Diamond Jubilee Edition package was introduced to commemorate Ford Motor Company&#x27;s 75th anniversary. Designer Series Editions and the Luxury Group offerings continued with revised color selections and trim.

For 1978, a two-stage, base-coat/clear-coat, was used for the Mark V for metallic colors only. Non-metallic, solid paint colors continued to use the traditional, single-stage paint.

Joining the optional full vinyl and rear vinyl roof options for 1978, was a full-length, simulated-convertible white canvas-embossed vinyl &quot;Carriage Roof&quot; option with an interior trim panel vanity mirror in lieu of opera windows. The power glass moonroof was not available with the Carriage Roof.

New options for 1978 included a digital (L.E.D. display) &quot;Miles-to-Empty&quot; fuel indicator, new wire wheel covers (non-locking) a garage door control integrated at the lower edge of the driver&#x27;s side visor, a driver&#x27;s illuminated exterior thermometer, a 40-channel CB radio with integrated hand-held microphone and controls as well as an integrated tri-band (AM/FM/CB) power antenna.

For 1978 only, revised standard wheel covers became available, with fewer ribs along the outside diameter of the wheel cover.

1978 models featured optional one year only, electro-mechanical seat belt warning chimes, standard only on Diamond Jubilee Edition. Lesser Mark Vs (in all years) were equipped with a traditional seatbelt warning buzzer, with a separate &quot;key in ignition&quot; warning buzzer unit.

===1979===
The 7.5 L (460 cid) V8 and dual-exhaust 400 V8 are discontinued to meet the newly mandated Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.

A new AM/FM stereo radio with cassette tape player, as well as Ford&#x27;s new Electronic AM/FM Stereo Search Radio with Quadrasonic 8-track tape player, became optional. The latter received a floor-mounted foot switch to scan radio stations or advance tracks on the 8-track player.

As the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Series&quot; package became available, the optional Designer Series and Luxury Group featured revised color and trim selections.

The 1972-style Luxury Wheel Covers returned for Mark V&#x27;s final year as standard issue (on all but Collector&#x27;s Series and Designer Series models) - as would the optional Wire Wheel Covers (now standard on Emilio Pucci Designer Series) and Forged Aluminum Wheels. The also-optional very popular Turbine Style Aluminum Wheels continued with argent accent paint between the spokes, except on Collector&#x27;s Series, and the Cartier, Bill Blass, and Givenchy Designer Series - where these models would be treated to color-keyed paint between the spokes, for unique added flair.

The white canvas-textured vinyl Carriage Roof option was standard on Bill Blass Designer Series with revised interior rear quarter trim panels with reading/courtesy lights. These new interior quarter trim panel inserts would also appear on the Collector&#x27;s Series where the roof design eliminated the opera windows.

1978&#x27;s electro-mechanical seat belt warning chimes carried over into 1979, standard on the Collector&#x27;s Series and the Designer Series.

Full and Rear Landau vinyl roof options continued for 1979. The rare, all-metal, body-color painted roof (no vinyl whatsoever) was discontinued.

===Features===

Standard on all Mark Vs were four-wheel disc brakes, an anti-skid brake system, a Cartier-branded clock with a day/date feature, automatic temperature control air conditioning, power windows, a six-way power driver&#x27;s seat, and a power radio antenna.

The 1978 Mark V offered an optional &quot;Miles-To-Empty&quot; indicator, replacing the &quot;low fuel&quot; lamp. The system represented the first dashboard LED display of a mechanical function.

==Editions==
Through its production, the Mark V was offered with appearance packages, marketed as the Designer Series, as well as a Luxury Group option package.

Two commemorative editions included the 1978 Diamond Jubilee Edition, marking Ford&#x27;s 75th anniversary, and the 1979 Collector&#x27;s Series, marking the end of Mark V production.

===Luxury Group (1977–1979)===
From 1973 to 1981, Lincoln offered the Luxury Group option for Mark-series buyers, allowing a customer to select cloth or leather/vinyl interior trim, one to four exterior paint colors, landau or full-length vinyl or painted metal roof, bodyside molding (otherwise black) decklid paint stripe, wheels or wheel covers and black or whitewall tires.

Along with these combinations, customers ordering could order other options as well.

Below are some examples of the Luxury Group colors available during production:
* Gold-Cream (1977–1979)
* Cordovan (1977–1979)
* Light Jade/Dark Jade (1977–1978)
* Turquoise (1979)
* Midnight Blue-Cream (1977)
* Red-Rosé (1977–1979)
* Wedgewood Blue (1978–1979)
* Champagne (1979)
* White (1979)
* Majestic Velour (1977)

===Designer Series (1977–1979)===
Designer Series appearance packages were available in Bill Blass, Cartier, Givenchy, and Emilio Pucci series — each with coordinated exterior paint, interior upholstery and trim, vinyl roof and body-side moldings. Each was distinguished by a corresponding decklid decal, the designer&#x27;s signature in the opera window glass, and a dash-mounted 22-karat gold-plated nameplate.

Designer Series options varied each year. In 1979, the Bill Blass, Cartier, and Givenchy Designer Series adopted color-keyed alloy wheels alongside the Collector&#x27;s Series (a feature introduced on the Diamond Jubilee Edition).
===Diamond Jubilee Edition (1978)===

To commemorate the 75th anniversary of Ford Motor Company in 1978; Ford released &quot;Diamond Jubilee Editions&quot; of the 1978 Ford Thunderbird and Continental Mark V. Adding $8,000 to the price of a Mark V, the Continental Mark V Diamond Jubilee was the most expensive vehicle ever sold by Ford Motor Company at the time, raising the price of the Mark V to over $21,000 ($ in dollars ). Only four options were available: the 460 V8 (with or without dual exhaust) a power moonroof, and a 40-channel CB radio.

In a style similar to the Designer Series, the Diamond Jubilee Edition was given its own design. The exterior was given a nearly monochromatic exterior, with color-keyed body moldings, vinyl top, wheels, grille, hood ornament, and trunk lid; two colors were available and exclusive to the edition (Diamond Blue and Jubilee Gold). Chrome trim was largely limited to the window and grille surrounds, bumpers, and trim of the fender vents (exclusive to the edition). Alongside the Lincoln Versailles, the Diamond Jubilee Edition was one of the first Ford Motor Company vehicles to utilize clear-coat paint.

The interior was given its own model-specific trim. The split front bench seat was replaced by cloth bucket seats with a center console with a padded armrest; the rest of the interior included padded leather on high-wear areas. Designed to provide extra storage, the console stored an umbrella on the underside of the armrest. Matching its name, the opera windows featured simulated diamond chips inside the glass, with a Diamond Jubilee script on the window the hood ornament featured crystal-style inserts. All Diamond Jubilee Marks were supplied with a leather-bound owner&#x27;s manual and tool kit. Every new owner was given car keys matching the interior trim and could request a Ford-created cookbook entitled &quot;&quot;Ford Diamond Jubilee Recipe Collection&quot;.&quot;

In total, 5,159 Diamond Jubilee Edition Continental Mark Vs were produced. For 1979, the edition was repackaged as the Collector&#x27;s Series.

===Collector&#x27;s Series (1979)===

To commemorate the end of Continental Mark V production, the 1978 Diamond Jubilee Edition was repackaged for 1979 as the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Series&quot;. An $8,000 option for the Mark V ($ in dollars ) the Collector&#x27;s Series Edition had a base price of nearly $22,000 ($ in dollars ). Alongside the Mark V, Lincoln marketed a similar edition of the Lincoln Continental sedan.

Distinguished from all other examples of the Mark V by its lack of opera windows, the Collector&#x27;s Series was produced in four colors Midnight Blue Moondust Metallic, White, Diamond Blue Moondust Metallic (shared with the Diamond Jubilee Edition) and Light Silver Moondust Metallic. In a slightly monochromatic appearance, midnight blue and white cars have matching vinyl tops while silver and diamond-blue cars have midnight blue vinyl tops; all examples were given a gold-colored grille with a gold-trimmed hood ornament. Inside the trunk, both the trunk floor and the underside of the decklid were lined with color-keyed midnight-blue 18-ounce carpeting.

As with the Diamond Jubilee Edition, the Collector&#x27;s Series included virtually every available feature as standard equipment on the Mark V. A cloth interior with a center console, rear-seat armrest, and bucket seats was standard; as a delete option, the Collector&#x27;s Series could be ordered with a standard Mark V leather interior. Another delete option replaced the 8-track tape player with a cassette player.

In total, 6,262 Collector&#x27;s Series editions were produced. 3,900 Midnight Blue examples were built, with 2,040 White (an unknown number without any vinyl top) 197 Diamond Blue, and 125 Silver.

==Sales==
Although only on sale for three model years, with a total of 228,262 examples sold, the Continental Mark V is the best-selling version of the Continental Mark Series.

<doc id="609751" wikidata="Q16920558" url="?curid=609751" title="Rescue Services Agency (Sweden)">
<text>The Swedish Rescue Services Agency (SRSA) () was the central supervisory government agency for the rescue services in Sweden until 2008, after which it merged into the newly formed Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency on 1 January 2009. It promoted emergency management practice that improved disaster prevention and response, and in the event of an incident/accident limited injury and damage. This was achieved among other ways by conveying information, by running training courses and holding exercises, and through supervision.
==Government function==
The SRSA was the central Swedish supervisory government authority for the rescue services. Its tasks included examining co-ordination between the various branches of the national rescue services, as well as contingency planning by the county administrative boards for the rescue services in the event of a release of radioactive substances. The agency also collated observations and lessons learned from serious emergencies that have occurred at home or abroad. Its tasks included examining co-ordination between the various branches of the state rescue services, as well as the county administrative boards&#x27; planning for the rescue services in the event of a release of radioactive substances. The agency gained experience from major incidents that have occurred in Sweden and worldwide. The SRSA developed methods and equipment for use by the rescue services, and was responsible for the training of all personnel in the municipal fire and rescue service brigades and in the chimney sweeping service. The agency also implemented rules for safety in relation to the transport of dangerous goods by road and rail, and co-ordinated the work of the supervisory authorities within this field.
===Domestic expertise===
In the event of oil spill, equipment from one of the agency’s five oil-combating depots may be used. The agency also had seven depots holding equipment and trained personnel for use when responding to chemical emergencies. Furthermore, the government had an agreement with six municipalities, which states that they are to assist the Swedish Maritime Administration and the Swedish Coast Guard with emergency operations at sea.
===Overseas operations===
The SRSA maintained a state of emergency preparedness to assist other countries with rescue and humanitarian aid operations. The majority of personnel employed on such assignments were recruited from the municipal fire &amp; rescue services. The SRSA was a prominent actor in mine action and Explosive Ordnance Disposal for development.
==Organisation==
The central administration offices for the Swedish Rescue Services Agency were situated in Karlstad. Their four colleges were located at Revingeby, Rosersberg Palace, Sandö and Skövde provided the training for all the personnel in the municipal fire &amp; rescue services and in the chimney sweeping service. The agency had its main office in Karlstad and its offices for overseas operations in Kristinehamn.

==Restructuring==
On 18 March 2008 the Swedish government made a decision to restructure its peace-time emergency management agencies. As part of this decision, the SRSA, the Swedish Emergency Management Agency, and the Swedish National Board of Psychological Defence were dissolved at the end of 2008. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency replaced the previous three bodies.

<doc id="609753" wikidata="Q450285" url="?curid=609753" title="Mikael Åkerfeldt">
<text>Lars Mikael Åkerfeldt (; born 17 April 1974) is a Swedish musician. He is the lead vocalist, guitarist, and primary songwriter for the progressive metal band Opeth. A former vocalist for the death metal supergroup Bloodbath, he was also the guitarist for the &quot;one-off&quot; band Steel, and a member of the collaboration Storm Corrosion with Steven Wilson.

Åkerfeldt is known for his progressive rock-influenced songwriting style and his frequent use of both clean baritone and growled vocals. He was ranked #42 on &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s list of the 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time, and #11 among &quot;The Top 25 Modern Metal Guitarists&quot; on MetalSucks.

==Career==
A native of Stockholm, Mikael Åkerfeldt was the vocalist for Eruption, a death metal band he formed in 1987 at the age of 13. After Eruption disbanded in 1989, he joined Opeth, initially as a keyboardist. When their original bassist left Opeth two years later, Åkerfeldt replaced him on bass, and Isberg then assumed guitar duties. When Isberg left Opeth three years later, Åkerfeldt took over as the lead vocalist.

Åkerfeldt performed the death vocals on Katatonia&#x27;s album &quot;Brave Murder Day&quot; and their EP &quot;Sounds of Decay&quot;.

In September 2009, Åkerfeldt revealed he was contemplating recording a singer-songwriter acoustic solo album. However, in 2014, he expressed the view that he did not feel the need for a special solo project, noting that he could put pretty much anything into Opeth.

In an interview with STIM magazine, he revealed that one of the highlights of his career was Opeth&#x27;s performance at the Royal Albert Hall.

In 2020, Åkerfeldt was approached by director Jonas Åkerlund to compose the soundtrack for the Swedish six-part Netflix series &quot;Clark&quot;, which was released in May 2022. This marked his first foray into film scoring.

===Influences===
Åkerfeldt is a collector of obscure 1970s rock and heavy metal albums. He also draws influence from these obscure bands, making references to them in Opeth album titles such as &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, &quot;Still Life&quot;, and &quot;My Arms, Your Hearse&quot;, as well as in songs like &quot;Master&#x27;s Apprentices&quot; and &quot;Goblin.&quot; He is also heavily influenced by jazz, the musician Ritchie Blackmore, Magma and its founder Christian Vander, and Hideki Ishima.

When asked about the album that &quot;made him a metalhead,&quot; Åkerfeldt answered that it was probably &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; by Iron Maiden, but he also mentioned &quot;Lick It Up&quot; by Kiss. In another interview, he stated that he usually cites Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; as the best (and his favorite) heavy metal album of all time. He has also considered Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; to be his favorite metal album.

==Personal life==
On 15 August 2003, Mikael Åkerfeldt married his longtime girlfriend, Anna. In 2004, Anna gave birth to their first daughter, Melinda. The couple had their second daughter, Mirjam, in 2007. She delivered spoken words on track #1 of Opeth&#x27;s 2024 album &quot;The Last Will and Testament&quot;. In 2016, Åkerfeldt revealed in an interview with &quot;The Quietus&quot; that he had gone through a divorce.

Åkerfeldt is known to be friends with Steven Wilson, the frontman of one of his favorite bands, Porcupine Tree, who also produced the Opeth albums &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, and &quot;Damnation&quot;; Mike Portnoy, drummer of Dream Theater (who is featured in their music video for &quot;Wither&quot;); and Jonas Renkse of Katatonia. He is also presumed to be the basis for the character Toki Wartooth from the popular cartoon &quot;Metalocalypse&quot;, as revealed in an interview with Ultimate Guitar. Åkerfeldt does not practice any religion and considers himself an atheist.

==Equipment==
Åkerfeldt has almost exclusively used PRS guitars since the Deliverance/Damnation era and has his own signature model. He also occasionally uses guitars by a variety of other brands, including Gibson and Jackson.

<text>Harborne is an affluent area sited south-west of Birmingham, in the West Midlands, England. It is a Birmingham City Council ward in the formal district and in the parliamentary constituency of Birmingham Edgbaston.

== History ==


There is evidence of a Roman fort around the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham and Metchley Park, near Harborne.

The earliest written mention of Harborne is an entry in the Domesday Book of 1086, however the settlement pre-dates this. The spelling of &quot;Harborne&quot; has appeared with several variations through the centuries, and the derivation of the place name has often been disputed. One of the more probable suggestions is &#x27;boundary brook&#x27;, although &#x27;high brow&#x27; and &#x27;dirty brook&#x27; are also possibilities.

Harborne is a Victorian suburb with a large stock of housing dating from pre-1900 (found mainly around the High Street), and the early 20th century. The oldest part of what is known locally as &#x27;Harborne Village&#x27; is centred on St Peter&#x27;s Church, (Church of England), Old Church Road, which dates from Anglo-Saxon times (St Chad preached there) and whose tower was (re)constructed in the 14th century.

As a non-Quaker area of the city, Harborne became well-supplied with public houses compared to nearby areas such as Edgbaston and Bournville. There is a famous &quot;Harborne Run&quot; pub crawl consisting of from 10 to 15 pubs (the agreed itinerary varies).

St Mary&#x27;s Church was the first Roman Catholic congregation formed by the Passionists who worshiped in a disused Methodist Chapel on Harborne High Street from 1870. Building work started on the current church, in Vivian Road, on 8 September 1875 and it opened on 6 February 1877. 
The Augustinians (Austin Friars) arrived at St Mary&#x27;s in 1973 to a growing Catholic population; work on a new church, attached to the side of the old church, started on 1 August 1977 and was finished in 56 weeks. St Mary&#x27;s Parish Centre was opened in 1990 and is next door to the church.

Harborne railway station opened on 10 August 1874, at the end of the short Harborne Branch Line; this left the London, Midland and Scottish Railway&#x27;s Birmingham-Wolverhampton line at Ladywood. It was closed to passengers on 26 November 1934 and to freight traffic in November 1963. The former trackbed forms the &quot;Harborne Walkway&quot;, a two-mile (3 km) nature walk and cycling route from Harborne to Ladywood, where the canal can be followed either to Birmingham or Wolverhampton.

Harborne became part of the county borough of Birmingham and thus transferred from Staffordshire to Warwickshire in 1891 by the Local Govt. Bd.&#x27;s Prov. Orders Conf. (No. 13) Act, 54 &amp; 55 Vic. c. 161 (local act), or in 1894 In 1911, the civil parish had a population of 13,902. On 1 April 1912, the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham. It then became part of the West Midlands in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972.

== Geography ==
Harborne lies to the west of Edgbaston, to the north of Selly Oak, to the east of Quinton, and to the south of the Bearwood and Warley areas of neighbouring Sandwell.

As a parish, it covered an area of , of which was of woodland and plantations.

Harts Green is an area of Harborne.

== Demographics ==
The United Kingdom 2011 census revealed that 23,001 lived in Harborne; 17% of people were aged under 16, 69% were aged between 16 and 64, while 14% were aged over 65. The minority ethnic population made up 33% of the ward&#x27;s population, compared with 41% for Birmingham. The census found that 75% (11,997) of the population aged 16 to 74 were working or seeking work, which compared with 69% for Birmingham.

==Education==
There are four secondary schools in Harborne: Baskerville School, Harborne Academy, Lordswood Boys&#x27; School and Lordswood Girls&#x27; School.

There are six primary schools: Birmingham Blue Coat School, Chad Vale Primary School (both lie on the border between Harborne and Edgbaston), Harborne Primary School, St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, St Peter&#x27;s Church of England Primary School and Welsh House Farm Community School.

Harborne is currently served by Harborne Library which formally opened on 12 November 1892, occupying a former Masonic Hall, which was built in 1879.

===Harborne Primary School===
Harborne Primary School is a co-educational primary school for pupils aged 4 to 11. As of September 2014, the school had 629 students.

The Edwardian infant school opened in 1902; a junior school was added to the site in 1912. In September 2000 the two schools were merged, forming Harborne Primary School as it is today.

On 27 April 2011, a roof fire caused significant damage to the structure of the junior school. More than 60 firefighters tackled the blaze. None of the pupils or staff were injured. The infant school reopened a week later, with the juniors moved to nearby Harborne Hall hotel for six months whilst the rebuild took place. Birmingham City Council awarded the school £1.3 million for the rebuild project, which was completed a year later, in April 2012.

In 2015, the school submitted plans to build an annex site on the ground of Lordswood Girls&#x27; School, to expand the school from 630 to 1050 places. The plans were opposed by residents of the nearby Hagley Road Retirement Village. Further plans were submitted for a site on Court Oak Road, near Queen Alexandra College, to expand the school to 840 pupil places. In preparation for the expansion, the school will accept a further 30 reception children on its main site in September 2018. The one form entry annexe opened in September 2019.

<text>No Quarter Pounder is an album by the American band Dread Zeppelin, released in 1995. Its title is wordplay on the Led Zeppelin song &quot;No Quarter&quot;, and the name of a McDonald&#x27;s hamburger, the Quarter Pounder. The band promoted the album with a North American tour.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; noted that &quot;once around, it was fun and funny ... But after four or five albums (lost track there) it&#x27;s worn as thin as [singer] Tortelvis&#x27;s Jenny Craig fantasies.&quot; The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; argued that &quot;it&#x27;s still a good joke, because Tortelvis combines a great voice with a truly warped sense of humor,&quot; and considered the album to be better than &quot;The Fun Sessions&quot;. 

The &quot;Houston Press&quot; wrote: &quot;The idea of a reggae band fronted by an Elvis impersonator performing Led Zeppelin cover tunes should have been, at most, a one-hit novelty. But because Dread Zep told the joke so well, they&#x27;ve endured and won approving nods from even those &#x27;70s survivors who thought Zeppelin sucked almost as bad as disco.&quot; The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; dismissed &quot;No Quarter Pounder&quot; as &quot;even more lifeless than its inspirations.&quot;

<text>&quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; is a song by the American singer-songwriter Carly Simon, released as a single in November 1972. The lyrics describe a self-absorbed lover, whose identity has long been a matter of speculation. Simon said the song refers to three men, one of whom she has named publicly: the actor Warren Beatty.

Simon wrote &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; over the course of a year. The song was originally titled &quot;Bless You, Ben.&quot; The bass guitar intro was played by Klaus Voormann. The strings were arranged by Simon and orchestrated by Paul Buckmaster.

In early 1973, &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; reached No. 1 in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1994, it was ranked 72nd in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 50th anniversary all-time chart. At the 16th Annual Grammy Awards in 1974, it was nominated for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. It was voted No. 216 in RIAA&#x27;s Songs of the Century, and in August 2014, the UK&#x27;s Official Charts Company named it the ultimate song of the 1970s. In 2021, the song was ranked 495th on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

== Lyrics ==
A year after Simon had written the chorus lyric, &quot;You&#x27;re so vain, you probably think this song is about you,&quot; a scarfed man arriving at a party studied himself in a mirror; Simon&#x27;s friend said, &quot;he looks like he&#x27;s walking onto a yacht,&quot; inspiring more lyrics, including, &quot;You…watched yourself gavotte.&quot; That refers to a French dance, as it provided the necessary rhyme and &quot;that&#x27;s what a pretentious, vain man would do.&quot; The line &quot;clouds in my coffee&quot; was inspired by a comment from her piano player, Billy Mernit, who observed that clouds were reflected in a cup of coffee she was drinking.

The lyrics, &quot;…you went up to Saratoga, and your horse naturally won. Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia, to see the total eclipse of the sun,&quot; may refer to a 1970 eclipse visible along the east coast of North America, including New York City, where Simon lived at the time; or it may refer to a 1972 eclipse only visible in northern and eastern Canada a few months before she recorded the song. Simon told the CBC that she took artistic license with the reference, and the subject may not have actually witnessed the eclipse in Nova Scotia. The 2012 biography &quot;More Room in a Broken Heart: The True Adventures of Carly Simon&quot; quotes her: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know anyone who raced at Saratoga or went to view the total eclipse, I just wanted to portray someone who thought he was ultra-cool.&quot;

=== Subject ===

In 1972, Simon told an interviewer that the song was about &quot;men&quot;, not a specific man. In 1983, she said it was not about Mick Jagger, who contributed uncredited backing vocals to the song. In a 1993 book, Angie Bowie said she was the wife of a &quot;close friend&quot; mentioned in &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;, and that Jagger had been &quot;obsessed&quot; with her.

Simon appeared as a guest artist on Janet Jackson&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;Son of a Gun (I Betcha Think This Song Is About You)&quot;, which sampled &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;. In the song, Simon recites: &quot;The apricot scarf was worn by Nick / Nothing in the words referred to Mick.&quot; &quot;Nick&quot; refers to the novelist Nicholas Delbanco, whom Simon dated in the 1960s. Simon denied that the song referred to her ex-husband James Taylor. David Bowie, David Cassidy and Cat Stevens have been cited by the press as possibilities.

In August 2003, Simon agreed to reveal the subject to the highest bidder of the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Possible Dreams charity auction. The highest bid was $50,000 from Simon&#x27;s friend Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports. A condition of the prize was that Ebersol not reveal the name. Ebersol said Simon allowed him to divulge a clue, and said the person&#x27;s name contained the letter E. In 2004, Simon said the name also contained the letters A and R. In 2005, Simon&#x27;s ex-husband, Jim Hart, said he was sure the song was not about anyone famous.

In her 2008 book &quot;Girls Like Us&quot;, Sheila Weller includes a detailed account of Simon&#x27;s love affair with the musician Dan Armstrong, and suggests that he was the inspiration. Her heartbreak over losing him inspired the song &quot;Dan, My Fling&quot;, which appears on her first album. The radio host Howard Stern said Simon had privately revealed the identity to him after her 2014 interview on his radio show; Stern said, &quot;There is an odd aspect to it... He&#x27;s not that vain.&quot; He also said she said it was a &quot;composite of three people&quot;. Simon confirmed that she had given the names to a few people, including Stern.

In an interview for WNYC in November 2009, Simon said she had hidden the name of the subject in a new recording of the song. The next day, WNYC crew detected the name &quot;David&quot; concealed in a back-played whisper. However, Simon said she had spoken &quot;Ovid&quot; both forwards and backwards, and that this sounded like David. In February 2010, Simon reiterated that the name was whispered in a rerecording of &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s a little whisper—and it&#x27;s the answer to the puzzle.&quot; A representative for Simon said the name was &quot;David&quot;.

Media outlets speculated that the subject was the Elektra Records executive David Geffen. Hart immediately downplayed this. Simon later said she had not met Geffen when she wrote the song in 1971. Simon&#x27;s publicist confirmed the song was not about Geffen, but that there was &quot;a David who is connected to the song in some way, shape, or form&quot;. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; noted that in addition to &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Warren&quot; and an unintelligible name are whispered in the song. After her performance of the song with Simon in July 2013, the songwriter Taylor Swift said that Simon had revealed the identity of the subject to her in confidence.

In 1983, Simon said the actor Warren Beatty &quot;certainly thought it was about him—he called me and said thanks for the song&quot;. In 2007, Beatty said, &quot;Let&#x27;s be honest. That song was about me.&quot; In November 2015, Simon, promoting her memoirs, said, &quot;I have confirmed that the second verse is Warren ... Warren thinks the whole thing is about him ... Now, that doesn&#x27;t mean that the other two verses aren&#x27;t also about Warren. It just means that the second one is.&quot; The song originally had a fourth verse, possibly including another subject.

==Reception==
Reviewing the single, &quot;Record World&quot; called it Simon&#x27;s &quot;most commercial song yet&quot;, praising the lyrics, melody and string arrangements. At the 16th Annual Grammy Awards in 1974, &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; was nominated for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.

In 1994, &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; was ranked 72nd in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 50th anniversary all-time chart. It was voted No. 216 in RIAA&#x27;s Songs of the Century, and in 2014 the UK Official Charts Company named it the ultimate song of the 1970s. In 2021, it was ranked 495th on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

== Sales ==
The song was a No. 1 hit in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and reached No 4 in Ireland and South Africa. Entering at No. 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 2 December 1972, the song took five more weeks to rise to the top of the chart, where it stayed for the first three weeks of 1973. It was replaced by Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Superstition&quot; and spent the next month in the runner-up spot. It also spent two weeks at the top of the Easy Listening chart in early 1973, her first No. 1 on either chart. &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; was Simon&#x27;s breakthrough hit in the United Kingdom, reaching No. 3 on the UK chart on its original release in 1973. The song was re-released in the UK in 1991 to cash in on its inclusion in a commercial for Dunlop Tyres, peaking at No. 41.

<doc id="609806" wikidata="Q291310" url="?curid=609806" title="Alexander Yegorov (soldier)">
<text>Alexander Ilyich Yegorov or Egorov () ( – 23 February 1939) was a Soviet military leader and one of the original five Marshals of the Soviet Union.

Yegorov was born in Samara to a middle-class family. He joined the Imperial Russian Army in 1901 and saw action during the First World War. Following the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, Yegorov became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was one of the few trusted ex-tsarist officers in the Red Army. During the Russian Civil War, he commanded the Red Army&#x27;s Southern Front and played an important part in defeating the White forces in Ukraine. Yegorov was the commander of the Southwestern Front during the Polish–Soviet War. 

A good friend of Joseph Stalin, Yegorov further advanced his career in the 1920s. He served briefly as a military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek and Feng Yuxiang in China, and following his return to the Soviet Union he commanded the Belorussian Military District. In 1934, Yegorov was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and a year later he was named a Marshal of the Soviet Union and Chief of the General Staff.

When the Great Purge began, Yegorov was initially spared, and he was one of the judges that presided over the trial of Mikhail Tukhachevsky. By the end of 1937 he had become a target, and he was arrested a few months later. Yegorov was executed in February 1939.

== Early life ==
Yegorov was born near Samara in central Russia, to a middle-class family. In 1901, after completing six classes of classical gymnasium in Samara, he joined the Imperial Russian Army, as a volunteer.

==Military career==
After graduating from Junkers school in Kazan in 1905, he was assigned to Transcaucasia, where he and his unit participated in suppressing protests in Tiflis, Baku and Gori, during the Russian Revolution of 1905. For his participation in the pacification of protests, he was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus, 3rd class. In 1904, he had joined the Socialist Revolutionary Party, but withdrew his membership in 1909.
===World War I===
During World War I he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and fought as the commander of the company and battalion within the 132nd Bender Infantry Regiment. He was injured three times, and was awarded the Golden Sword for Bravery and six other decorations for his heroism. In the four months of 1915, he served as a battalion commander of one of the reserve regiments in Tver, followed by another two months training future ensigns in Riga.

===Russian Civil War and Polish-Soviet War ===

During the February Revolution, hoping to further develop his military career, he re-joined the Socialist Revolutionaries and became a member of the military council of the 32nd division on behalf of the Socialist Revolutionaries. He broke up with them in the summer of 1918, after their unsuccessful rebellion against the Bolshevik authorities. In 1918, he joined the newly created Workers and Peasants Red Army and in July 1918, he also became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1918, he chaired the officer verification commission for the newly created Red Army and was the commissioner of its general staff.

As one of the few ex-tsarist officers at this stage who was trusted by the Bolshevik leadership, he was assigned to the Southern Front. From August to October 1918, he commanded the section within Balashov and Kamyshin, and the 9th Army, where he formed regular units from irregular Red Army formations. On 26 December 1918 he replaced Kliment Voroshilov as commander of the 10th Army, during the Battle of Tsaritsyn. In March 1919, with over 23000 troops under his command, he carried out an offensive along the railway line from Tsaritsyn to Velikoknyazheskaya. The 10th Army was halted by the White Army soldiers led by General Konstantin Mamontov, in the swampy areas near River Manych, but the numerical superiority of the Red Army gave them a chance to continue their march towards Bataysk and Tikhoretsk.
From July 1919, he commanded the 14th Army fighting in eastern Ukraine. In the autumn of 1919, replacing Vladimir Gittis, he took command of the entire Southern Front in the face of the threat posed by the offensive of the Armed Forces of South Russia under the command of General Anton Denikin. The forces under his command successfully defeated Denikin&#x27;s forces and in October 1919, the forces under Yegerov&#x27;s command captured Oryol and together with the troops of the Southeastern Front led by Vasily Shorin, they captured Voronezh, crossed the Don River and then drove off the White Army units from Rostov-on-Don and Novocherkassk. After these events, the White Army finally lost the initiative in the civil war. For his battle successes, Yegorov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.

During the Polish-Soviet War, Yegorov served as commander of the Southwestern Front, which consisted of the 8th, 12th, 13th and 14th Armies. The front commissar was Joseph Stalin, whose deputy was Yan Berzin. Initially, the forces under his command achieved a number of successes, including the capture of Kyiv, Podolia and Galicia from Poles, and approached closer to Lwów. However, Yegorov, disregarding the orders of the high command, did not send the First Cavalry Army commanded by Semyon Budyonny to reinforce the Western Front, which led to successful defense of Lwów by Polish Army troops led by General Edward Rydz-Śmigły and the subsequent Soviet defeat in the Battle of Warsaw in 1920.

===Post war===

His further career in the 1920s was facilitated by good relations with Stalin, whom he met during the defense of Tsaritsyn. Both men were considered friends and their families spent holidays together. However, Stalin never trusted Yegorov and believed that the latter had never become a good communist. Stalin had collected a private archive of discreditable materials against Yegorov.

After the Polish-Soviet War, Yegorov served as commander of the Kiev and Petrograd Military Districts from December 1920 to September 1921. From September 1921 to May 1924, he served as commander of the Western Front and the Red Banner Caucasus Army. From April 1924 to March 1925, he again served as the commander of the Kiev Military District.

In 1925, he was sent to China, where he served as a military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek and Feng Yuxiang. This was considered an important task for the Soviet leadership, as Soviet Union sought to protect its own interests in China and also to support the Communist movement in China. He served there till 1926.

In 1927, he became commander of the Belorussian Military District. In 1931, Yegorov was appointed Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence and Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army. In 1934, he became a candidate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1935, he became one of the first five Marshals of the Soviet Union when this rank was created.

===Purge and execution===
Because of his old connections to Stalin and Budyonny, Yegorov seemed to be safe from the wave of arrests that swept through the Red Army in 1937 as the Great Purge gathered pace.

He was officially listed as one of the judges at Tukhachevsky&#x27;s trial in June 1937. But at the end of 1937 he was demoted to commander of the Transcaucasian Military District, and was arrested in February 1938 and his military writings were banned. His downfall seems to have begun with a letter in the spring of 1937 from Kombrig Fedor Sudakov of the Frunze Military Academy to Stalin questioning Yegorov&#x27;s performance; a similar letter was sent by Kombrig Yan Zhigur to Voroshilov on 20 July, and Yegorov was further damaged by confessions extracted from officers arrested during the purge of the army. Yegorov was shot on 23 February 1939. He was cremated and his ashes were buried in a mass grave at Donskoi Cemetery in Moscow.

After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev rehabilitated Yegorov by the decision of the 
Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union. He was also posthumously reinstated his rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union and military awards restored.

==Personal life==
In 1911, he married Varvara Alexandrovna Egorova (Vasilyeva), with whom he had daughter named Tatyana. After divorcing his first wife, he remarried Galina Antonovna Tseshkovskaya, who was of Polish descent. During the Great Purge, Galina was also arrested and after being accused as a Polish spy, she was executed before her husband on 28 August 1938.

Yegorov&#x27;s grandson is guitarist Aleksey Kuznetsov, a recipient of the title People&#x27;s Artist of Russia.

<doc id="609807" wikidata="Q2218279" url="?curid=609807" title="Greater short-horned lizard">
<text>The greater short-horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma hernandesi)&quot;, also commonly known as the mountain short-horned lizard or Hernández&#x27;s short-horned lizard, is a species of lizard in the family Phrynosomatidae. The species is endemic to western North America. Like other horned lizards, it is often called a &quot;horned toad&quot; or &quot;horny toad&quot;, but it is not a toad at all. It is a reptile, not an amphibian. It is one of seven native species of lizards in Canada.

==Etymology==
The genus Phrynosoma, means toad-bodied. The specific name, &quot;hernandesi&quot;, honors Francisco Hernández (1514–1587) a Spanish physician who wrote an early account of a horned lizard, which was published in 1615.

==Identification==
The greater short-horned lizard is often mistaken for its close relative the pygmy short-horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma douglasii)&quot;, which has the same basic body type consisting of small pointed scales around the head and back. Until recent mitochondrial DNA evidence, &quot;P. hernandesi&quot; was considered to be the same species as &quot;P. douglasii&quot;. They are now considered distinct species with the pygmy short-horned lizard (&quot;P. douglasii)&quot; occupying the northwest portion of the United States and extreme southern British Columbia. When placed together the two are easily distinguished at full size, the pygmy short-horned lizard being much smaller. &quot;P. hernandesi&quot; is a highly variable species with different geographic populations exhibiting differences in color, pattern and size with some authorities describing five subspecies.

The greater short-horned lizard ranges in size from 2 to 5 inches (5.1 to 12.7 cm) in snout-to-vent length (SVL) and is a flat-bodied, squat lizard with scales around the top of the head, normally called a &quot;crown&quot;. It has a snub-nosed profile and short legs. The trunk is fringed by one row of pointed scales, while the belly scales are smooth. The color is gray, yellowish, or reddish-brown, and there are two rows of large dark spots on the back. When threatened or aggressive, its colors become more intense.

Females grow to larger sizes than males: females average about 7 cm (about 2.75 inches) SVL, with a maximum total length (including tail) of about 15 cm (about 6 inches), and weigh about ; whereas males have an SVL of only about 5 cm (about 2 inches), and weigh on the average about . The adult male dermatocranial shape resembles that to be expected of a subadult female of the same body size.

==Behavior==

The greater short-horned lizard is a &quot;sit-and-wait&quot; predator. It feeds primarily on ants, but also takes an occasional grasshopper or beetle. Often, it can be found sitting in the vicinity of a nest or trails. It is a diurnal creature, being most active during the evening and burrowing at night. It relies extensively on camouflage to avoid predators. Horned lizards have been shown to darken their skin when threatened or to regulate temperature. Typically, greater short-horned lizards will remain as still as possible when a predator is nearby, attempting to blend in with the environment. However if provoked, some species of horned lizards can build up blood pressure in regions behind their eyes and accurately squirt their blood at attacking predators, which will deter canids from continuing their attack. It is rare for horned lizards to squirt blood at humans however, reserving this unique defense primarily for canids (i.e. foxes, coyotes, dogs), which have a strong reaction of distaste to the blood. Squirting blood has been observed in the greater short-horned lizard, but has not been observed in the pygmy short-horned lizard.

==Reproduction==
The mating season for &quot;P. hernandesi&quot; is in spring (May to June). It is viviparous, giving live birth: the female births five to 48 offspring from July to September. The young measure about SVL and weigh each about . The young have no horns yet and are able to take care of themselves within a few hours; they are not able to fully crawl until they are a day old. Males become sexually active after their first year of life, and females generally take two years before they can start reproducing.

==Geographic range==
The greater short-horned lizard is the most widely distributed horned lizard in North America and occurs in the widest range of habitats: West into central Nevada, east into North and South Dakota, north to southern Saskatchewan and Alberta, and then south into eastern New Mexico to central Mexico, with a few pockets in Trans-Pecos Texas. This species of lizard is mostly an arid mountain dweller living in the range of 900–11,300 feet (170–3440 m). It is the only member of its genus in Wyoming, which counts &quot;Phrynosoma&quot; as its state reptile. It is also considered an endangered species in Saskatchewan and Alberta.

==Habitat==
The greater short-horned lizard occupies habitats from semiarid plains to high elevations in the mountains. This species is frequently found in a wide range of habitats like shortgrass prairies, sagebrush deserts, and juniper, pine, or fir forests. The soil in these habitats can be stony or rocky but usually has fine loose soil or sand present. The greater short-horned lizard is more cold tolerant than other species and is able to reach higher elevations and a greater distribution where the temperature is much cooler.

<text>A kinesin is a protein complex belonging to a class of motor proteins found in eukaryotic cells. Kinesins move along microtubule (MT) filaments and are powered by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (thus kinesins are ATPases, a type of enzyme). The active movement of kinesins supports several cellular functions including mitosis, meiosis and transport of cellular cargo, such as in axonal transport, and intraflagellar transport. Most kinesins walk towards the plus end of a microtubule, which, in most cells, entails transporting cargo such as protein and membrane components from the center of the cell towards the periphery. This form of transport is known as anterograde transport. In contrast, dyneins are motor proteins that move toward the minus end of a microtubule in retrograde transport.

== Discovery ==
The first kinesins to be discovered were microtubule-based anterograde intracellular transport motors in 1985, based on their motility in cytoplasm extruded from the giant axon of the squid.

The founding member of this superfamily, kinesin-1, was isolated as a heterotetrameric fast axonal organelle transport motor consisting of four parts: two identical motor subunits (called Kinesin Heavy Chain (KHC) molecules) and two other molecules each known as a Kinesin Light Chain (KLC). These were discovered via microtubule affinity purification from neuronal cell extracts. Subsequently, a different, heterotrimeric plus-end-directed MT-based motor named kinesin-2, consisting of two distinct KHC-related motor subunits and an accessory &quot;KAP&quot; subunit, was purified from echinoderm egg/embryo extracts and is best known for its role in transporting protein complexes (intraflagellar transport particles) along axonemes during ciliogenesis. Molecular genetic and genomic approaches have led to the recognition that the kinesins form a diverse superfamily of motors that are responsible for multiple intracellular motility events in eukaryotic cells. For example, the genomes of mammals encode more than 40 kinesin proteins, organized into at least 14 families named kinesin-1 through kinesin-14.

== Structure ==

=== Overall structure ===
Members of the kinesin superfamily vary in shape but the prototypical kinesin-1 motor consists of two Kinesin Heavy Chain (KHC) molecules which form a protein dimer (molecule pair) that binds two light chains (KLCs), which are unique for different cargos.

The heavy chain of kinesin-1 comprises a globular head (the motor domain) at the amino terminal end connected via a short, flexible neck linker to the stalk – a long, central alpha-helical coiled coil domain – that ends in a carboxy terminal tail domain which associates with the light-chains. The stalks of two KHCs intertwine to form a coiled coil that directs dimerization of the two KHCs. In most cases transported cargo binds to the kinesin light chains, at the TPR motif sequence of the KLC, but in some cases cargo binds to the C-terminal domains of the heavy chains.

=== Kinesin motor domain ===

The head is the signature of kinesin and its amino acid sequence is well conserved among various kinesins. Each head has two separate binding sites: one for the microtubule and the other for ATP. ATP binding and hydrolysis as well as ADP release change the conformation of the microtubule-binding domains and the orientation of the neck linker with respect to the head; this results in the motion of the kinesin. Several structural elements in the head, including a central beta-sheet domain and the Switch I and II domains, have been implicated as mediating the interactions between the two binding sites and the neck domain. Kinesins are structurally related to G proteins, which hydrolyze GTP instead of ATP. Several structural elements are shared between the two families, notably the Switch I and Switch II domain.

=== Basic kinesin regulation ===
Kinesins tend to have low basal enzymatic activity which becomes significant when microtubule-activated. In addition, many members of the kinesin superfamily can be self-inhibited by the binding of tail domain to the motor domain. Such self-inhibition can then be relieved via additional regulation such as binding to cargo, cargo adapters or other microtubule-associated proteins.

== Cargo transport ==
In the cell, small molecules, such as gases and glucose, diffuse to where they are needed. Large molecules synthesised in the cell body, intracellular components such as vesicles and organelles such as mitochondria are too large (and the cytosol too crowded) to be able to diffuse to their destinations. Motor proteins fulfill the role of transporting large cargo about the cell to their required destinations. Kinesins are motor proteins that transport such cargo by walking unidirectionally along microtubule tracks hydrolysing one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at each step. It was thought that ATP hydrolysis powered each step, the energy released propelling the head forwards to the next binding site. However, it has been proposed that the head diffuses forward and the force of binding to the microtubule is what pulls the cargo along. In addition viruses, HIV for example, exploit kinesins to allow virus particle shuttling after assembly.

There is significant evidence that cargoes in-vivo are transported by multiple motors.

== Direction of motion ==
Motor proteins travel in a specific direction along a microtubule. Microtubules are polar; meaning, the heads only bind to the microtubule in one orientation, while ATP binding gives each step its direction through a process known as neck linker zippering.

It has been previously known that kinesin move cargo towards the plus (+) end of a microtubule, also known as anterograde transport/orthograde transport. However, it has been recently discovered that in budding yeast cells kinesin Cin8 (a member of the Kinesin-5 family) can move toward the minus end as well, or retrograde transport. This means, these unique yeast kinesin homotetramers have the novel ability to move bi-directionally. Kinesin, so far, has only been shown to move toward the minus end when in a group, with motors sliding in the antiparallel direction in an attempt to separate microtubules. This dual directionality has been observed in identical conditions where free Cin8 molecules move towards the minus end, but cross-linking Cin8 move toward the plus ends of each cross-linked microtubule. One specific study tested the speed at which Cin8 motors moved, their results yielded a range of about 25-55 nm/s, in the direction of the spindle poles. On an individual basis it has been found that by varying ionic conditions Cin8 motors can become as fast as 380 nm/s. It is suggested that the bidirectionality of yeast kinesin-5 motors such as Cin8 and Cut7 is a result of coupling with other Cin8 motors and helps to fulfill the role of dynein in budding yeast, as opposed to the human homologue of these motors, the plus directed Eg5. This discovery in kinesin-14 family proteins (such as &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; NCD, budding yeast KAR3, and &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; ATK5) allows kinesin to walk in the opposite direction, toward microtubule minus end. This is not typical of kinesin, rather, an exception to the normal direction of movement.

Another type of motor protein, known as dyneins, move towards the minus end of the microtubule. Thus, they transport cargo from the periphery of the cell towards the center. An example of this would be transport occurring from the terminal boutons of a neuronal axon to the cell body (soma). This is known as &quot;retrograde transport&quot;.

== Mechanism of movement ==
In 2023 direct visualization of kinesin &quot;walking&quot; along a microtubule in real-time was reported. In a &quot;hand-over-hand&quot; mechanism, the kinesin heads step past one another, alternating the lead position. Thus in each step the leading head becomes the trailing head, while the trailing head becomes the leading head.

* This cycle begins with the trailing head releasing inorganic phosphate (Pi) derived from the hydrolysis of ATP.
* The trailing head detaches from the microtubule and rotates into its rightward displaced unbound state.
* The leading head binds ATP which causes the neck linker to dock to it, which moves the trailing head around the leading head into a position further along the microtubule in the direction of travel. The trailing head remains unbound.
* The ATP in the leading head is hydrolyzed.
* The trailing head releases its ADP and the binds to the microtubule becoming the leading head.

== Theoretical modeling ==
A number of theoretical models of the molecular motor protein kinesin have been proposed. Many challenges are encountered in theoretical investigations given the remaining uncertainties about the roles of protein structures, the precise way energy from ATP is transformed into mechanical work, and the roles played by thermal fluctuations. This is a rather active area of research. There is a need especially for approaches which better make a link with the molecular architecture of the protein and data obtained from experimental investigations.

The single-molecule dynamics are already well described but it seems that these nano scale machines typically work in large teams.

Single-molecule dynamics are based on the distinct chemical states of the motor and observations about its mechanical steps. For small concentrations of adenosine diphosphate, the motor&#x27;s behaviour is governed by the competition of two chemomechanical motor cycles which determine the motor&#x27;s stall force. A third cycle becomes important for large ADP concentrations. Models with a single cycle have been discussed too. Seiferth et al. demonstrated how quantities such as the velocity or the entropy production of a motor change when adjacent states are merged in a multi-cyclic model until eventually the number of cycles is reduced.

Recent experimental research has shown that kinesins, while moving along microtubules, interact with each other, the interactions being short range and weak attractive (1.6±0.5 KBT). One model that has been developed takes into account these particle interactions, where the dynamic rates change accordingly with the energy of interaction. If the energy is positive the rate of creating bonds (q) will be higher while the rate of breaking bonds (r) will be lower. One can understand that the rates of entrance and exit in the microtubule will be changed as well by the energy (See figure 1 in reference 30). If the second site is occupied the rate of entrance will be α*q and if the last but one site is occupied the rate of exit will be β*r. This theoretical approach agrees with the results of Monte Carlo simulations for this model, especially for the limiting case of very large negative energy. The normal totally asymmetric simple exclusion process for (or TASEP) results can be recovered from this model making the energy equal to zero.

== Mitosis ==
In recent years, it has been found that microtubule-based molecular motors (including a number of kinesins) have a role in mitosis (cell division). Kinesins are important for proper spindle length and are involved in sliding microtubules apart within the spindle during prometaphase and metaphase, as well as depolymerizing microtubule minus ends at centrosomes during anaphase. Specifically, Kinesin-5 family proteins act within the spindle to slide microtubules apart, while the Kinesin 13 family act to depolymerize microtubules.

<text>New Tattoo is the eighth studio album by the American heavy metal band Mötley Crüe, released in 2000. Artistically, &quot;New Tattoo&quot; shows the band returning to the earlier musical style that gave them commercial success in the 1980s and early 1990s. This is the only album by the band not to feature drummer Tommy Lee, who left the band a year before, and was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo on the album. The album also marked Castillo’s final full-length studio recording project that he was involved in before his death in March 2002.

The album artwork was inspired by the cover of Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s album &quot;Tattooed Millionaire&quot;, whose title track is said to be about Dickinson&#x27;s wife cheating on him with bassist Nikki Sixx, as revealed in Mötley Crüe&#x27;s biography &quot;The Dirt&quot;.

== Background ==
The original line up of Mötley Crüe, which consisted of singer Vince Neil, bassist Nikki Sixx, drummer Tommy Lee and guitarist Mick Mars, had reunited for the &quot;Generation Swine&quot; album and tour in 1997, mainly out of pressure from their management and record company. Even though the group had reunited, problems still existed between Lee and Neil, as Lee felt that the band had been going in a backward direction since Neil rejoined the group. Lee was also having domestic problems with his wife, model Pamela Anderson, which, after an altercation following an argument, led to him serving time in jail.

During this time, Mötley Crüe and Elektra Records severed their 17-year relationship together, with Mötley Crüe gaining full ownership of its music catalog and publishing rights. The break with Elektra allowed the group to form its own label, Mötley Records, to release future projects on.

Lee&#x27;s legal problems forced the band to decline invitations from Ozzfest and various radio festivals, though the band managed to record two new songs for their 1998 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, &quot;Bitter Pill&quot; and &quot;Enslaved,&quot; which were more in the style of their 1980&#x27;s output than their 1990&#x27;s work.

While Lee was in jail, he decided that he was going to leave Mötley Crüe and start his own project, which eventually became Methods of Mayhem. Lee stayed with the group for the tour of their greatest hits album, but after each show he would retreat to his portable studio and work on material for his new project. With Lee out of the band, the band hired Randy Castillo, who had previously performed with Lita Ford and Ozzy Osbourne, as his replacement.

== Recording ==
Mötley Crüe teamed up with producer Mike Clink to record the album that Sixx felt should have been the successor to their 1989 album, &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;.

Longtime guitarist Mick Mars claims he had little actual involvement in &quot;New Tattoo&quot;, stating that his bandmates denied him the chance to participate due to lingering bad feelings from the recording of &quot;Generation Swine&quot;. &quot;I didn&#x27;t write any of those songs, since I wasn&#x27;t invited,&quot; said Mars. &quot;I think I played one lick on that album.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;New Tattoo&quot; debuted at No. 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and slid down shortly after. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold about 203,000 copies in the U.S. to date. The songs &quot;Hell on High Heels&quot;, which featured a music video and charted at number 13 on the Mainstream rock charts, &quot;New Tattoo&quot; and &quot;Treat Me Like the Dog I Am&quot; were released as singles for the album.

== Touring and aftermath ==
Right before the tour in support of the album, Castillo fell ill with a duodenal ulcer. Hole drummer Samantha Maloney filled in for the tour. While recovering from stomach surgery, Castillo was diagnosed with Squamous cell Carcinoma. After Castillo&#x27;s death in March 2002, Mötley Crüe went on hiatus until their 2004 reunion, with Tommy Lee back in the fold.

None of the songs from the album were played live again after the tour ended; With the exception of one performance of &quot;White Punks on Dope&quot; in 2005, and was played each night with a mashup of cover songs on the 2022 stadium tour

<doc id="609812" wikidata="Q410134" url="?curid=609812" title="Dynein">
<text>Dyneins are a family of cytoskeletal motor proteins (though they are actually protein complexes) that move along microtubules in cells. They convert the chemical energy stored in ATP to mechanical work. Dynein transports various cellular cargos, provides forces and displacements important in mitosis, and drives the beat of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. All of these functions rely on dynein&#x27;s ability to move towards the minus-end of the microtubules, known as retrograde transport; thus, they are called &quot;minus-end directed motors&quot;. In contrast, most kinesin motor proteins move toward the microtubules&#x27; plus-end, in what is called anterograde transport.

==Classification==

Dyneins can be divided into two groups: cytoplasmic dyneins and axonemal dyneins, which are also called ciliary or flagellar dyneins.

* cytoplasmic
** heavy chain: DYNC1H1, DYNC2H1
** intermediate chain: DYNC1I1, DYNC1I2
** light intermediate chain: DYNC1LI1, DYNC1LI2, DYNC2LI1
** light chain: DYNLL1, DYNLL2, DYNLRB1, DYNLRB2, DYNLT1, DYNLT3
* axonemal
** heavy chain: DNAH1, DNAH2, DNAH3, DNAH5, DNAH6, DNAH7, DNAH8, DNAH9, DNAH10, DNAH11, DNAH12, DNAH13, DNAH14, DNAH17
** intermediate chain: DNAI1, DNAI2
** light intermediate chain: DNALI1
** light chain: DNAL1, DNAL4

== Function ==

Axonemal dynein causes sliding of microtubules in the axonemes of cilia and flagella and is found only in cells that have those structures.

Cytoplasmic dynein, found in all animal cells and possibly plant cells as well, performs functions necessary for cell survival such as organelle transport and centrosome assembly. Cytoplasmic dynein moves processively along the microtubule; that is, one or the other of its stalks is always attached to the microtubule so that the dynein can &quot;walk&quot; a considerable distance along a microtubule without detaching.

Cytoplasmic dynein helps to position the Golgi complex and other organelles in the cell. It also helps transport cargo needed for cell function such as vesicles made by the endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes, and lysosomes (Karp, 2005). Dynein is involved in the movement of chromosomes and positioning the mitotic spindles for cell division. Dynein carries organelles, vesicles and possibly microtubule fragments along the axons of neurons toward the cell body in a process called retrograde axonal transport. Additionally, dynein motor is also responsible for the transport of degradative endosomes retrogradely in the dendrites. 

=== Mitotic spindle positioning ===
Cytoplasmic dynein positions the spindle at the site of cytokinesis by anchoring to the cell cortex and pulling on astral microtubules emanating from centrosome. While a postdoctoral student at MIT, Tomomi Kiyomitsu discovered how dynein has a role as a motor protein in aligning the chromosomes in the middle of the cell during the metaphase of mitosis. Dynein pulls the microtubules and chromosomes to one end of the cell. When the end of the microtubules become close to the cell membrane, they release a chemical signal that punts the dynein to the other side of the cell. It does this repeatedly so the chromosomes end up in the center of the cell, which is necessary in mitosis. Budding yeast have been a powerful model organism to study this process and has shown that dynein is targeted to plus ends of astral microtubules and delivered to the cell cortex via an offloading mechanism.

===Viral replication===
Dynein and kinesin can both be exploited by viruses to mediate the viral replication process. Many viruses use the microtubule transport system to transport nucleic acid/protein cores to intracellular replication sites after invasion host the cell membrane. Not much is known about virus&#x27; motor-specific binding sites, but it is known that some viruses contain proline-rich sequences (that diverge between viruses) which, when removed, reduces dynactin binding, axon transport (in culture), and neuroinvasion in vivo. This suggests that proline-rich sequences may be a major binding site that co-opts dynein.

== Structure ==
Each molecule of the dynein motor is a complex protein assembly composed of many smaller polypeptide subunits. Cytoplasmic and axonemal dynein contain some of the same components, but they also contain some unique subunits.

===Cytoplasmic dynein===
Cytoplasmic dynein, which has a molecular mass of about 1.5 megadaltons (MDa), is a dimer of dimers, containing approximately twelve polypeptide subunits: two identical &quot;heavy chains&quot;, 520 kDa in mass, which contain the ATPase activity and are thus responsible for generating movement along the microtubule; two 74 kDa intermediate chains which are believed to anchor the dynein to its cargo; two 53–59 kDa light intermediate chains; and several light chains.

The force-generating ATPase activity of each dynein heavy chain is located in its large doughnut-shaped &quot;head&quot;, which is related to other AAA proteins, while two projections from the head connect it to other cytoplasmic structures. One projection, the coiled-coil stalk, binds to and &quot;walks&quot; along the surface of the microtubule via a repeated cycle of detachment and reattachment. The other projection, the extended tail, binds to the light intermediate, intermediate and light chain subunits which attach dynein to its cargo. The alternating activity of the paired heavy chains in the complete cytoplasmic dynein motor enables a single dynein molecule to transport its cargo by &quot;walking&quot; a considerable distance along a microtubule without becoming completely detached.

In the apo-state of dynein, the motor is nucleotide free, the AAA domain ring exists in an open conformation, and the MTBD exists in a high affinity state. Much about the AAA domains remains unknown, but AAA1 is well established as the primary site of ATP hydrolysis in dynein. When ATP binds to AAA1, it initiates a conformational change of the AAA domain ring into the “closed” configuration, movement of the buttress, and a conformational change in the linker. The linker becomes bent and shifts from AAA5 to AAA2 while remaining bound to AAA1. One attached &quot;alpha&quot;-helix from the stalk is pulled by the buttress, sliding the helix half a heptad repeat relative to its coilled-coil partner, and kinking the stalk. As a result, the MTBD of dynein enters a low-affinity state, allowing the motor to move to new binding sites. Following hydrolysis of ATP, the stalk rotates, moving dynein further along the MT. Upon the release of the phosphate, the MTBD returns to a high affinity state and rebinds the MT, triggering the power stroke. The linker returns to a straight conformation and swings back to AAA5 from AAA2 and creates a lever-action, producing the greatest displacement of dynein achieved by the power stroke The cycle concludes with the release of ADP, which returns the AAA domain ring back to the “open” configuration.

Yeast dynein can walk along microtubules without detaching, however in metazoans, cytoplasmic dynein must be activated by the binding of dynactin, another multisubunit protein that is essential for mitosis, and a cargo adaptor. The tri-complex, which includes dynein, dynactin and a cargo adaptor, is ultra-processive and can walk long distances without detaching in order to reach the cargo&#x27;s intracellular destination. Cargo adaptors identified thus far include BicD2, Hook3, FIP3 and Spindly. The light intermediate chain, which is a member of the Ras superfamily, mediates the attachment of several cargo adaptors to the dynein motor. The other tail subunits may also help facilitate this interaction as evidenced in a low resolution structure of dynein-dynactin-BicD2.

One major form of motor regulation within cells for dynein is dynactin. It may be required for almost all cytoplasmic dynein functions. Currently, it is the best studied dynein partner. Dynactin is a protein that aids in intracellular transport throughout the cell by linking to cytoplasmic dynein. Dynactin can function as a scaffold for other proteins to bind to. It also functions as a recruiting factor that localizes dynein to where it should be. There is also some evidence suggesting that it may regulate kinesin-2. The dynactin complex is composed of more than 20 subunits, of which p150(Glued) is the largest. There is no definitive evidence that dynactin by itself affects the velocity of the motor. It does, however, affect the processivity of the motor. The binding regulation is likely allosteric: experiments have shown that the enhancements provided in the processivity of the dynein motor do not depend on the p150 subunit binding domain to the microtubules.

===Axonemal dynein===
Axonemal dyneins come in multiple forms that contain either one, two or three non-identical heavy chains (depending upon the organism and location in the cilium). Each heavy chain has a globular motor domain with a doughnut-shaped structure believed to resemble that of other AAA proteins, a coiled coil &quot;stalk&quot; that binds to the microtubule, and an extended tail (or &quot;stem&quot;) that attaches to a neighboring microtubule of the same axoneme. Each dynein molecule thus forms a cross-bridge between two adjacent microtubules of the ciliary axoneme. During the &quot;power stroke&quot;, which causes movement, the AAA ATPase motor domain undergoes a conformational change that causes the microtubule-binding stalk to pivot relative to the cargo-binding tail with the result that one microtubule slides relative to the other (Karp, 2005). This sliding produces the bending movement needed for cilia to beat and propel the cell or other particles. Groups of dynein molecules responsible for movement in opposite directions are probably activated and inactivated in a coordinated fashion so that the cilia or flagella can move back and forth. The radial spoke has been proposed as the (or one of the) structures that synchronizes this movement.

The regulation of axonemal dynein activity is critical for flagellar beat frequency and cilia waveform. Modes of axonemal dynein regulation include phosphorylation, redox, and calcium. Mechanical forces on the axoneme also affect axonemal dynein function. The heavy chains of inner and outer arms of axonemal dynein are phosphorylated/dephosphorylated to control the rate of microtubule sliding. Thioredoxins associated with the other axonemal dynein arms are oxidized/reduced to regulate where dynein binds in the axoneme. Centerin and components of the outer axonemal dynein arms detect fluctuations in calcium concentration. Calcium fluctuations play an important role in altering cilia waveform and flagellar beat frequency (King, 2012).

==History==

The protein responsible for movement of cilia and flagella was first discovered and named dynein in 1963 (Karp, 2005). 20 years later, cytoplasmic dynein, which had been suspected to exist since the discovery of flagellar dynein, was isolated and identified (Karp, 2005).

==Chromosome segregation during meiosis==

Segregation of homologous chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell occurs during the first division of meiosis. Proper segregation is essential for producing haploid meiotic products with a normal complement of chromosomes. The formation of chiasmata (crossover recombination events) appears to generally facilitate proper segregation. However, in the fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;, when chiasmata are absent, dynein promotes segregation. Dhc1, the motor subunit of dynein, is required for chromosomal segregation in both the presence and absence of chiasmata. The dynein light chain Dlc1 protein is also required for segregation, specifically when chiasmata are absent.

<doc id="609819" wikidata="Q46132" url="?curid=609819" title="Alvin Lee">
<text>Alvin Lee (born Graham Anthony Barnes; 19 December 1944 – 6 March 2013) was an English guitarist, singer and songwriter, who was best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the blues rock band Ten Years After.

==Early life==
Lee was born in Nottingham and attended the Margaret Glen-Bott School in Wollaton. He began playing guitar at the age of 13. In 1960, Lee, along with bassist Leo Lyons, formed the core of the band Ten Years After. He was influenced by his parents&#x27; collection of jazz and blues records, but it was the advent of rock and roll that sparked his interest.

==Career==
Lee&#x27;s performance at the Woodstock Festival was captured on film in the documentary of the event, and his &#x27;lightning-fast&#x27; playing helped catapult him to stardom. The film brought Lee&#x27;s music to a worldwide audience, although he later lamented that he missed the lost freedom and spiritual dedication of earlier audiences.

Lee was named &quot;the fastest guitarist in the West&quot; and considered a precursor to shred-style playing that would develop in the 1980s.

Ten Years After had success, releasing ten albums together, but by 1973 Lee was feeling limited by the band&#x27;s style. Moving to Columbia Records had resulted in a radio hit song, &quot;I&#x27;d Love to Change the World&quot; but Lee preferred blues-rock to the pop style the label preferred. He left the group after their second Columbia LP. With American Christian rock pioneer Mylon LeFevre, along with guests George Harrison, Steve Winwood, Ronnie Wood and Mick Fleetwood, he recorded and released &quot;On the Road to Freedom&quot;, an acclaimed album that was at the forefront of country rock. Also in 1973, he sat in on the Jerry Lee Lewis double album &quot;The Session...Recorded in London with Great Artists&quot; recorded in London, featuring many other guest stars including Albert Lee, Peter Frampton and Rory Gallagher. A year later, in response to a dare, Lee formed Alvin Lee &amp; Company to play a show at the Rainbow Theatre in London and released it as a double live album, &quot;In Flight&quot;. Various members of the band continued on with Lee for his next two albums, &quot;Pump Iron!&quot; and &quot;Let It Rock&quot;. In late 1975, he played guitar for a couple of tracks on Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;The 20th Anniversary of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; all-star album. He ended the 1970s with an outfit called Ten Years Later, with Tom Compton on drums and Mick Hawksworth on bass, which released two albums, &quot;Rocket Fuel&quot; (1978) and &quot;Ride On&quot; (1979), and toured extensively throughout Europe and the United States.

The 1980s brought another change in Lee&#x27;s direction, with two albums that were collaborations with Rare Bird&#x27;s Steve Gould and a tour for which the former John Mayall and Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor joined his band.

Lee&#x27;s overall musical output includes more than 20 albums, including 1987&#x27;s &quot;Detroit Diesel&quot;, 1989&#x27;s &quot;About Time&quot; (the reunion album he did with Ten Years After) recorded in Memphis with producer Terry Manning and the back to back 1990s collections of &quot;Zoom&quot; and &quot;Nineteen Ninety-Four&quot; (US title &quot;I Hear You Rockin&quot;&#x27;). Guest artists on both albums included George Harrison.

&quot;In Tennessee&quot;, recorded with Scotty Moore and D. J. Fontana, was released in 2004. Lee&#x27;s last album, &quot;Still on the Road to Freedom&quot;, was released in September 2012.

==Death==
Lee died on 6 March 2013 in Spain. He died from &quot;unforeseen complications following a routine surgical procedure&quot; to correct an atrial arrhythmia. He was 68. His former bandmates lamented his death. Leo Lyons called him &quot;the closest thing I had to a brother&quot;, while Ric Lee (no relation) said &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even sunk in yet as to the reality of his passing&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; highlighted such landmark performances as &quot;I&#x27;m Going Home&quot; from the Woodstock festival and his 1971 hit single &quot;I&#x27;d Love to Change the World&quot;.

<doc id="609820" wikidata="Q3439068" url="?curid=609820" title="Roger Hedgecock">
<text>Roger Allan Hedgecock (born May 2, 1946) is an American politician and conservative talk radio host, who served as 30th mayor of San Diego between May 1983 and December 1985. His show is syndicated by Radio America.

==Early life and education==
Hedgecock was born in Compton, California. When Hedgecock was 10 years old, his family moved to the Loma Portal area of San Diego. His father was unable to work because of illness. The family faced tough times, and the younger Hedgecock worked various jobs in his youth. Since his youth, he has been an avid surfer.

He graduated from the Roman Catholic-affiliated St. Augustine High School. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1968 and a Juris Doctor degree from University of California, Hastings College of the Law in 1971. He practiced law and became city attorney for Del Mar, California, in 1974.

Hedgecock was not qualified for military service during the Vietnam War for medical reasons. His severe acne caused him to be rated first 1-Y and then 4-F.

==Political career==
Hedgecock became politically active at an early age, volunteering to work in US Senator Barry Goldwater&#x27;s 1964 presidential campaign. In 1976, he was elected to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors and served until 1983.

In 1983 he was elected mayor of San Diego. Although San Diego municipal elections are &quot;non-partisan&quot; (party affiliation is not listed on the ballot), Hedgecock ran as a &quot;progressive&quot; Republican. He campaigned to stop the &quot;Los Angelization&quot; of San Diego, a term in San Diego that is synonymous with the uncontrolled urban and suburban development, overcrowding and pollution of Los Angeles.

In 1985, Hedgecock was charged with felonies related to receiving over $350,000 in illegal campaign funds and was forced from office because of the scandal. The key players, including Hedgecock and his associates, admitted in sworn statements that they knowingly and willingly broke the law when they conspired to funnel money from a wealthy financier into Hedgecock&#x27;s 1983 mayoral campaign fund. Though Hedgecock claimed none of it was true, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and was found guilty of 12 counts of perjury, related to the alleged failure to report all campaign contributions. Since California, like most other states, does not allow convicted felons to hold elected office, Hedgecock resigned on December 5 of that year. His first trial ended in a mistrial with a hung jury after the jury deadlocked 11–1 in favor of conviction. However, two of the 12 jurors in the first trial submitted sworn statements that the jury bailiff, Al Burroughs, provided them with alcohol and tried to pressure them into finding Hedgecock guilty. State prosecutors investigated the possibility of criminal jury tampering. As part of the investigation, Burroughs admitted trying to influence the verdict. Under California superior court rules, any attempt on a bailiff&#x27;s part to influence a verdict is serious misconduct that can be grounds for reversal. However, prosecutors refused to release transcripts of their investigation interviews to Hedgecock&#x27;s attorneys.

A San Diego appellate court ruled in 1988 that the judge presiding over the second trial &quot;who had announced from the bench that he believed Hedgecock was guilty was wrong to block release of the transcripts to the defendant. Hedgecock was denied access to the documents for two more years until he appealed to the California Supreme Court, which ordered the transcripts released. In that appeal, the Supreme Court threw out 12 perjury convictions and set aside the remaining conspiracy charge pending a hearing on Hedgecock&#x27;s motion for a jury trial on grounds of jury tampering.

The defense obtained the transcripts in October 1990. The following month, Hedgecock reached a plea deal with prosecutors of one count of conspiracy in return for no prison time and no retrial. As part of the deal, a judge reduced the felony to a misdemeanor and dismissed the case on December 31, 1990.

==Radio and television career==
With the controversy ending his political career, Hedgecock accepted a job as a talk show host on San Diego&#x27;s AM 1130 KSDO, where he remained until moving to KOGO AM 600 in 1997. He started four days after resigning from the mayoralty, with his first show on January 20, 1986. His show aired from 9 a.m. to 12 noon. Several years later, Hedgecock&#x27;s time slot moved to 12 noon to 3 p.m., to make room for &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; in the schedule. His show eventually moved to the 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. time slot.

Beginning in November 2007, Hedgecock hosted a nationally syndicated radio talk show on Saturdays from 9:00 a.m. to 12 p.m., Pacific Time, the flagship station being KOGO. On January 5, 2009, his show began being syndicated nationwide by Radio America. Originally, the plan was for the fourth hour of the show to continue only on KOGO and continue the discussion of topics relevant to the local San Diego/Southern California audience, but KOGO later decided to drop the fourth hour altogether, thus bringing to an end the Community Forum, which had been his focus since the show&#x27;s inception in 1986.

In November 2011, it was announced that Hedgecock would be leaving his local flagship station, KOGO, and would move his nationally syndicated show to a new flagship home, radio station AM 760 KFMB, San Diego&#x27;s CBS radio and television network affiliate. His weekday 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Pacific Time broadcast debuted there on January 2, 2012. The show&#x27;s format continues to focus on political and social topics from a conservative point of view.

He has done simulcasts with talk hosts from other areas of the country, such as Lars Larson of AM 750 KXL in Portland, Oregon, and he often does transatlantic simulcasts with James Whale, on UK station, talkSPORT.

Until October 2007, he was also a frequent guest host for &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;, also nationally syndicated. Hedgecock was not invited again to guest host for Limbaugh after that time, according to Hedgecock&#x27;s producer of 15 years, because Limbaugh became angry when Hedgecock started a syndicated radio program on Saturdays without first informing Limbaugh.

To do his show, Hedgecock receives over $300,000 per year from Radio America, a division of the tax-exempt American Studies Center, based in Arlington, Virginia. Hedgecock also hosts a cable television program at U-T TV, run by Republican donor Doug Manchester.

Hedgecock appeared as a guest on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Time With Bill Maher&quot; in September 2012 and was joined on the panel by MSNBC’s Chris Matthews and &quot;Time&quot; magazine reporter Rana Foroohar.

On February 23, 2015, during the opening of his radio program, Hedgecock announced that he would be leaving his show on March 27, 2015. He made clear he would continue to do correspondence and interviews, but it would be the end of his radio show that he started in 1986, &quot;before Rush and before Hannity,&quot; when people told him that talking politics on the radio was taboo.

==Controversies==
In 1994, Hedgecock organized a group of protesters calling themselves &quot;The Normal People&quot;. They applied to march in the Pride parade “in political disagreement to the homosexual agenda.” When rejected by the organizers of the parade, Hedgecock filed a lawsuit, arguing that their exclusion violated San Diego&#x27;s &quot;Human Dignity Ordinance.&quot; The Superior Court rejected their claim, arguing that their right to march was not protected under the ordinance, since the parade was a private event and the &quot;Normal People&quot; message was intended to interfere with the event.

Hedgecock drew the attention of civil rights groups in 2006 when he invited white nationalists and other extremists to an anti-immigrant conference that he organized. He also was criticized for inviting one of the white nationalists, Peter Brimelow, onto a radio program Hedgecock hosted in 2008.

==Lawsuit against the City of San Diego==
In April 2017, Hedgecock sued the City of San Diego for &quot;the loss of support, service, love, companionship, society, affection, relations and solace from his wife&quot; (according to court records) after his wife broke her breast implants when she tripped on a public street; the lawsuit alleges that the sidewalk was uneven due to a nearby tree, causing Hedgecock&#x27;s wife to fall.

==Other endeavors==
In his early years, Hedgecock was an entrepreneur and worked in music concert promotions. One notable co-production of his was the 1969 Mother&#x27;s Day concert at Aztec Bowl (now the site of Viejas Arena, San Diego State University). Performers included Canned Heat, Grateful Dead, and Santana. Security was provided by the local Hells Angels motorcycle club to whom Hedgecock paid a signing bonus of a case of Jack Daniel&#x27;s.

In 1986 he formed a band with well-known San Diego journalist Thomas K. Arnold called The Arnold-Hedgecock Experience. Arnold was a writer for the &quot;San Diego Reader&quot;, &quot;San Diego Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and numerous other publications; in the early 1980s he also engineered 1960s pop star Gary Puckett&#x27;s comeback. They recorded a cover of &quot;Louie, Louie&quot; and donated proceeds to St. Vincent de Paul, a local charity; they played several concerts around town, including opening for The Kingsmen in Oceanside in front of 10,000 people. Arnold is currently the publisher and editorial director of Media Play News, one of five Hollywood trades and the only one dedicated to the home entertainment sector.

==Personal life==
He resides in San Diego. Since 2016, Hedgecock and his wife Cindy Hedgecock also own a 10-acre apple orchard in Julian, California, a mountain town east of San Diego. They have two sons.

<text>The Spain national football team () has represented Spain in men&#x27;s international football competitions since 1920. It is governed by the Royal Spanish Football Federation, the governing body for football in Spain.

Spain is one of eight national teams to have been crowned world champions and has participated in a total of 16 out of 22 FIFA World Cups, winning the 2010 edition, and qualifying consistently since 1978. Spain has participated in a total of 12 out of 17 UEFA European Championships, and are the reigning European champions, having won a record fourth title in 2024. After their victory in the 2023 UEFA Nations League they became the second national team, following France, to win three major titles (World Cup, European Championship and Nations League). Spain is also one of only two nations alongside Germany, to have won both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s World Cups.

Having won one World Cup, one Nations League and three European Championship titles since 2008, Spain is the most successful European national team of the 21st century. The team&#x27;s achievements from 2008 to 2012 have led many experts and commentators to consider this era&#x27;s squads one of the best ever teams in football history. During this period, Spain became the first national team to win three consecutive major titles, including two back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012, while becoming the first European team to win a World Cup held outside of Europe. Also in this period from 2008 to 2013, Spain won the FIFA Team of the Year, the second-most of any nation, behind only Brazil. One year before, from the start of 2007 to the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, Spain achieved 35 consecutive undefeated matches, a feat which they shared with Brazil, and a record for the sport at the time.

==History==
Spain has been a member of FIFA since its founding in 1904, even though the Spanish Football Federation was first established in 1909. The first Spain national football team was constituted in 1920, with the main objective of finding a team that would represent Spain at the 1920 Summer Olympics held in Belgium in that same year. Spain made their debut at the tournament on 28 August 1920 against Denmark, silver medalists at the last two Olympic tournaments. Spain managed to win that match by a scoreline of 1–0, eventually finishing with the silver medal. Spain qualified for their first FIFA World Cup in 1934, defeating Brazil in their first game and losing in a replay to the hosts and eventual champions Italy in the quarter-finals. The Spanish Civil War and World War II prevented Spain from playing any competitive matches between the 1934 World Cup and the 1950 edition&#x27;s qualifiers. At the 1950 finals in Brazil, they topped their group to progress to the finals round, then finished in fourth place. Until 2010, this had been Spain&#x27;s highest finish in a FIFA World Cup finals.

Spain won its first major international title when it hosted the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup, defeating the Soviet Union 2–1 in the final at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. The victory would stand as Spain&#x27;s lone major title for 44 years. Spain was selected as host of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, reaching the second round and four years later they reached the quarter-finals before a penalty shootout defeat to Belgium. Also at UEFA Euro 1984, they lost the final against France. Spain reached the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup. The match became controversial when Italian defender Mauro Tassotti struck Luis Enrique with his elbow inside Spain&#x27;s penalty area, causing Luis Enrique to bleed profusely from his nose and mouth, but it was not noticed nor sanctioned by referee Sándor Puhl. Had the official awarded a foul, Spain would have received a penalty kick. In the 2002 World Cup, Spain won its three group play matches, then defeated the Republic of Ireland on penalties in the second round. They faced co-hosts South Korea in the quarter-finals, losing in a shootout after having two goals controversially called back for alleged infractions during regular and extra time.
At UEFA Euro 2008, Spain won all their games in Group D. Italy were the opponents in the quarter-finals match, which Spain won 4–2 on penalties. They then met Russia again in the semi-finals, beating them 3–0. In the final, Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with Fernando Torres scoring the only goal of the game. This was Spain&#x27;s first major title since the 1964 European Championship. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament. The following year the side finished third at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup breaking their 35-match unbeaten streak that began in November 2006 after a loss to the United States. In the 2010 World Cup, Spain advanced to the final for the first time ever by defeating Germany 1–0. In the decisive match against the Netherlands, Andrés Iniesta scored the match&#x27;s only goal, coming in extra time. Spain became the third team to win a World Cup outside their own continent, and the first European team to do so. They then qualified for UEFA Euro 2012, finishing on top of Group I with a perfect 100% record. They became the first team to retain the European Championship, winning the final 4–0 against Italy, while Fernando Torres won the Golden Boot for top scorer of the tournament.

Spain advanced to the final of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, losing to hosts Brazil, and the following year they were eliminated from the group stage of the 2014 World Cup. At Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, the side reached the last 16 in both tournaments, losing to Italy 2–0 and Russia 4–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. In the UEFA Euro 2020, held in 2021 after COVID-19 pandemic caused delays, Spain made a breakthrough, reaching the last four of a major tournament for the first time since 2012, before losing to eventual champions Italy 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The team finished the tournament with two wins and four draws (including two penalty shootouts). The same year they managed to reach the 2021 UEFA Nations League final, losing against France. In the 2022 World Cup, Spain finished second in their group, then in the round of 16, they lost to Morocco 3–0 on penalties after a 0–0 draw, to be the third consecutive elimination from a major tournament in penalty shootouts.

Spain finished top of their group in UEFA Euro 2024 without conceding a goal, and went on to defeat Georgia in the round of 16 by 4–1. They eventually eliminated hosts Germany in the quarter-finals with a 2–1 win and defeated France in the semi-finals with the same result, qualifying for their fifth European Championships final. Spain won their record-breaking fourth European title by defeating England 2–1 in the final and became the first and only team to win all seven matches in a single European Championship tournament. They also set a new record of 15 goals scored in a single European Championship.

==Team image==
===Nicknames===
Spain&#x27;s team was known in the past by some fans as &quot;La furia española&quot;, ; this nickname was originally given by a Dutch newspaper, recalling the &quot;Sack of Antwerp&quot; – an episode in the military history of Spain. More modernly, the team is called &quot;La roja&quot;, .

===Style of play===


Between 2008 and 2012, the team played a style of football dubbed &#x27;tiki-taka&#x27;, a systems approach to football founded upon the ideal of team unity and a comprehensive understanding in the geometry of space on a football field.

Tiki-taka has been variously described as &quot;a style of play based on making your way to the back of the net through short passing and movement&quot;, a &quot;short passing style in which the ball is worked carefully through various channels&quot;, and a &quot;nonsensical phrase that has come to mean short passing, patience and possession above all else&quot;. The style involves roaming movement and positional interchange amongst midfielders, moving the ball in intricate patterns, and sharp, one or two-touch passing. Tiki-taka is &quot;both defensive and offensive in equal measure&quot; – the team is always in possession, so doesn&#x27;t need to switch between defending and attacking. Commentators have contrasted tiki-taka with &quot;Route One physicality&quot; and with the higher-tempo passing of Barcelona and Arsène Wenger&#x27;s 2007–08 Arsenal side, which employed Cesc Fàbregas as the only channel between defence and attack. Tiki-taka is associated with flair, creativity, and touch, but can also be taken to a &quot;slow, directionless extreme&quot; that sacrifices effectiveness for aesthetics.

Tiki-taka was successfully employed by Spain to win Euro 2008, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. The 2008–12 teams are regarded as being among the greatest of international teams in football history.

Sid Lowe identifies Luis Aragonés&#x27; tempering of tiki-taka with pragmatism as a key factor in Spain&#x27;s success in Euro 2008. Aragonés used tiki-taka to &quot;protect a defense that appeared suspect [...], maintain possession and dominate games&quot; without taking the style to &quot;evangelical extremes&quot;. None of Spain&#x27;s first six goals in the tournament came from tiki-taka: five came from direct breaks and one from a set play. For Lowe, Spain&#x27;s success in the 2010 World Cup was evidence of the meeting of two traditions in Spanish football: the &quot;powerful, aggressive, direct&quot; style that earned the silver medal-winning 1920 Antwerp Olympic team the nickname &quot;La furia española&quot; () and the tiki-taka style of the contemporary Spain&#x27;s team, which focused on a collective, short-passing, technical and possession-based game.

Analyzing Spain&#x27;s semi-final victory over Germany at the 2010 World Cup, Raphael Honigstein described Spain&#x27;s tiki-taka style as &quot;the most difficult version of football possible: an uncompromising passing game, coupled with intense, high pressing&quot;. For Honigstein, tiki-taka is &quot;a significant upgrade&quot; of the Netherlands&#x27; Total Football because it relies on ball movement rather than players switching position. Tiki-taka allowed Spain to &quot;control both the ball and the opponent&quot;.
 Spain held possession of ball more than their opponents in all matches from 2008 to 2024, a record of 136 games.

===Kits and crest===

Spain&#x27;s home kit is traditionally a red jersey with yellow trim, dark blue shorts, and black socks, whilst their current away kit is predominantly yellow, having been white traditionally. The color of the home socks started to alter throughout the 1990s from black to the same blue color as the shorts, then matching either the blue of the shorts or the red of the shirt until the mid-2010s when they returned to their traditional black before continuing the rotation in the 2020s. Spain&#x27;s kits have been produced by manufacturers including Adidas (from 1981 until 1983), Le Coq Sportif (from 1984 until 1990) and Adidas once again (since 1991). Rather than displaying the logo of the Spanish Football Federation, Spain&#x27;s jersey traditionally features the country&#x27;s coat of arms over the left side. After winning the 2010 World Cup, the World Cup winners badge was added to the right side of the jersey and a golden star at the top of Spain&#x27;s coat of arms.

===Home stadium===

Spain does not have a designated national stadium. The capital city of Madrid (Bernabéu and Metropolitano), Seville (Pizjuán, Villamarín and La Cartuja), Valencia (Mestalla and Orriols) and Barcelona (Camp Nou and Montjuïc), are the four Spanish cities that have hosted more than 15 national team matches, while also being home to the largest stadiums in the country.

Other friendly matches, as well as qualifying fixtures against smaller opponents, are played in provincial stadia. The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign included matches at the Reino de León in León, Los Cármenes in Granada, El Molinón in Gijón, and the Rico Pérez in Alicante.

===Media coverage===
Spain&#x27;s UEFA Nations League, UEFA European Qualifiers and all friendly matches, are televised nationwide by La 1, flagship television channel of the public broadcaster TVE.

==Rivalries==
Spain has rivalries with the five countries that has faced more times, the other four «Europe&#x27;s Big Five» nations and with its Iberian neighbor. In order by number of matches, Italy (41), Portugal (40), France (37), England (28) and Germany (27).

* Their rivalry with Italy, sometimes referred to as the «Mediterranean Derby», has been contested since 1920. Their first meeting was at the Olympic Games, in a 2–0 triumph for Spain on 2 September 1920 in Antwerp. Although the two nations are not immediate geographical neighbours, their rivalry at international level is enhanced by the strong performances of the representative clubs in UEFA competitions, in which they are among the leading associations and have each enjoyed spells of dominance. Since the quarter-finals match between the two countries at Euro 2008, the rivalry has renewed, with its most notable match between the two sides being in the UEFA Euro 2012 final, which Spain won 4–0. Spain has the advantage in the head-to-head, with 14 wins, 16 draws, and 11 losses, after 41 games, but both teams evenly split with 6 wins each when only competitive matches are counted.
* Their rivalry with Portugal, also known as the «Iberian Derby», has been contested since 1921. Their first meeting was a 3–1 triumph for Spain on 18 December 1921 in Madrid, the first ever international game for the Portuguese. Portugal lost their first matches, with their first draw (2–2) only coming in 1926. Portugal&#x27;s first win came much later (4–1) in 1947. In this friendly rivalry, Spain dominates the head-to-head record with 17 victories, 17 draws, and 6 losses, after 40 games. They also lead Portugal in competitive matches, with 5 wins to Portugal&#x27;s 1 with 5 draws.
* Their rivalry with France, sometimes referred to as the «Pyrenean Derby», has been contested since 1922. Their first meeting was a 4–0 triumph for Spain on 30 April 1922 in Bordeaux, though their first competitive meeting came in the UEFA Euro 1984 final, which France won to take over its first major international honours. Spain has the advantage in the head-to-head, with 17 wins, 7 draws, and 13 losses, after 37 games. However, France has a major advantage lin competitive matches, with 6 wins compared to just 3 of Spain.
* Their rivalry with England, has been contested since 1929. Their first meeting was a 4–3 victory for Spain on 15 May 1929 in Madrid, the first ever English defeat outside the British Isles. The first of their nine competitive fixtures came at the 1950 World Cup in Maracanã, where Spain won 1–0 with a Telmo Zarra legendary goal. In their another World Cup meeting in 1982, Spain received England as hosts at the Bernabéu, in a second round stage match ended 0–0. One year before, in 1981, Spain achieved its first victory at Wembley. At the European Championship, they have met three times. In 1980 a group stage victory 2–1 for England in Naples. In 1996 a quarter-final match-up at Wembley ended 0–0 after extra time with England advanced on penalties. Finally in 2024, at the UEFA Euro 2024 final, with England were aiming to win their first European title, while Spain were looking for the continental titles record, Spaniards won 2–1 in Berlin, winning a record fourth Euro&#x27;s championship. The head-to-head result for Spain is 11 wins, 4 draws and 13 losses, after 28 games.
* Their rivalry with Germany, has been contested since 1935. Their first meeting was a 2–1 victory for Spain on 12 May 1935 in Cologne. Spain only met a German side for the first time in any competitive fixture in 1966, as part of the 1966 World Cup, where West Germany (competing separately from East Germany at the time) came back to win 2–1.

==Competitive record==
===FIFA World Cup===

Although often entering tournaments as one of the favorites, Spain have often been perceived as underachieving at the World Cup. Spain&#x27;s first World Cup was in 1934. At that World Cup, Spain started their campaign by defeating Brazil 3–1 to advance to the quarter-finals, where they lost to hosts Italy in a replay. Before Spain&#x27;s success in 2010, their best result came in 1950, where they reached the last four. Spain were paired with the hosts Brazil, as well as Uruguay and Sweden. Spain managed a draw against Uruguay but defeats from Brazil and Sweden meant that Spain would end up in fourth place. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup held in South Africa, Spain became world champions for the first time after defeating the Netherlands 1–0 in the final, becoming the eighth country to win the World Cup.

===UEFA European Championship===

Spain have won the most UEFA European Championships (four titles). &quot;La Roja&quot; are also the only nation to date to have won consecutive championships. They have hosted the tournament once, in 1964 (one city was used to host games at Euro 2020) and have appeared in a total of twelve tournaments.

The team won their first international trophy on home soil in 1964, defeating the Soviet Union 2–1. Spain would reach the final twenty years later in 1984, where they would lose the final to France. Spain would not reach the final again until 2008, where they would defeat Germany 1–0. Four years later, Spain earned back-to-back titles, comprehensively defeating Italy 4–0 in the final in Kyiv.
It would take &quot;La Roja&quot; twelve years to reach another European final, doing so in 2024 against England, a match they won 2–1 to stand alone as the most successful national team in the competition&#x27;s history with four titles while at the same time becoming the first team ever to win all seven matches in a single tournament.


===UEFA Nations League===
Since the inaugural UEFA Nations League, La Roja have remained in League A and have reached the UEFA Nations League Finals on two occasions. At the 2021 Finals, Spain won their semi-final after defeating Italy 2–1 but lost to France in the final. In the following campaign, La Roja would again reach the final thanks to another win against Italy. Spain would then beat Croatia on penalties after a 0–0 draw.
&quot;*Draws include knockout matches decided via penalty shoot-out.&quot;
===CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions===
After winning their record fourth European title, Spain qualified to their first ever Intercontinental cup. Where they are scheduled to face Argentina, the reigning champions of the 2024 Copa America 
===FIFA Confederations Cup===
Spain made two appearances at the FIFA Confederations Cup. Their first appearance came in 2009 as European champions when they won a third place medal. Spain had lost 2–0 to the United States in the semi-finals. At the next edition, Spain qualified as both World and European champions. La Roja reached the final in Brazil, but lost 3–0 to the hosts.


===Olympic Games===
Spain made their debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics, where they played their first ever international match, a 1–0 victory over Denmark. At the conclusion of the tournament, Spain won their first silver medal.

<doc id="609845" wikidata="Q3530760" url="?curid=609845" title="Tom Keene (actor)">
<text>Tom Keene (born George Duryea; December 30, 1896 – August 4, 1963) was an American actor known mostly for his roles in B Westerns. During his almost 40-year career in motion pictures Tom Keene worked under three different names. From 1923, when he made his first picture, until 1930 he worked under his birth name, George Duryea. The last film he made under this name was &quot;Pardon My Gun&quot;. Beginning with the 1930 film &quot;Tol&#x27;able David&quot;, he used Tom Keene as his moniker. This name he used until 1944 when he changed it to Richard Powers. The first film he used this name in was &quot;Up in Arms&quot;. He continued to primarily use this name for the rest of his film career, though still used Tom Keene on occasion.

==Early life and career==
Born George Duryea (no known relation to fellow actor Dan Duryea despite a resemblance) in Rochester, New York, Keene studied at Columbia University and Carnegie Tech before embarking on an acting career. He made his film debut in the 1923 short film &quot;The Just a Little Late Club&quot;. Keene followed with roles in &quot;The Godless Girl&quot; (1929) directed by Cecil B. DeMille; &quot;Tide of Empire&quot; (1929) with Renée Adorée; &quot;Thunder&quot; with Lon Chaney, Sr.; &quot;Tol&#x27;able David&quot; (1930) and &quot;Sundown Trail&quot; (1931).

In 1934, King Vidor cast him in the socially conscious Depression oriented classic &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; with Karen Morley.


During the 1940s, Keene appeared in the film serial &quot;The Great Alaskan Mystery&quot; and two Dick Tracy films &quot;Dick Tracy&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome&quot; (1947). In the 1950s, he moved on to television with guest roles on &quot;The Range Rider&quot;; &quot;Buffalo Bill, Jr.&quot;; &quot;Fury&quot;; &quot;Judge Roy Bean&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;. Keene&#x27;s last film role was in Ed Wood&#x27;s cult film &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; (1957). He retired soon after this and focused on real estate and the insurance business.

==Death==
Keene died of cancer on August 4, 1963, aged 66. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Filmography==

Later in his career (after 1944), Keene was often credited as Richard Powers, and once as Dick Powers.

<text>Barry John Wilson (born 16 February 1972 in Kirkcaldy) is a Scottish football coach and former player.

==Playing career==
Wilson began his career in the Highland League at Ross County, where his father, Bobby Wilson, was manager. After a spell at Southampton, where he failed to break into the first team, he returned to Ross County before moving to Raith Rovers in 1994. He was a member of the Raith squad that played in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup. In July 1996 Wilson signed for Inverness Caledonian Thistle and helped them to the Scottish Third Division title in 1996–97. In the following few seasons Wilson established himself as a firm favourite of the Caley Thistle fans, with his extraordinarily quick runs down the right wing and his ability to both create and score goals.

During season 1999–00, Caley Thistle&#x27;s then-manager Steve Paterson decided to move Wilson up front as a striker, which proved an extremely successful tactic, with Wilson scoring a number of goals that season. In the summer of 2000, Wilson was sold to Livingston, with whom he won the Scottish First Division title and was promoted to the SPL.

After three years at Livingston, Wilson returned to Caley Thistle in August 2003, under the management of John Robertson. Since then he has once again proved a valuable asset to the team.

Wilson holds Scottish First Division winner&#x27;s medals, won with Caley Thistle, Livingston and Raith Rovers, a Scottish Third Division winner&#x27;s medal, won with Caley Thistle and a Challenge Cup winner&#x27;s medal, also won with Caley Thistle. His most historic achievement was in scoring the last senior Scottish goal of the old millennium (against Clydebank, 27 December 1999) and the first of the new millennium (against Livingston, 3 January 2000). He is also famous for scoring the opening goal when Caley Thistle beat Celtic 3–1 at Parkhead in the Scottish Cup on 8 February 2000.

Wilson joined St Johnstone on a one-month emergency loan in March 2008. He scored his first and only goal for St Johnstone in a 2–1 loss against Clyde. He returned to Caley Thistle after his loan spell with St Johnstone to win himself a new contract and went on to produce some outstanding performances in the closing games. This resulted in Craig Brewster awarding Wilson with a new 6-month contract. In December 2008, it was announced that Caley Thistle would not be offering Wilson a new contract and thus he would be free to move on when his current contract expired.

Wilson joined Dumfries club Queen of the South on 30 December 2008, after being released a month early from his Inverness contract He made his debut on 3 January 2009 in a Scottish Football League First Division match away to Morton. On 8 December 2009 the Queens website announced Wilson would be leaving in the January transfer window to return to Inverness where his home is. Manager Gordon Chisholm said of Wilson, &quot;He&#x27;s netted a lot of valuable goals for us and his experience has been a great asset&quot;. He had a short spell at Peterhead before joining Elgin City prior to the 2010–11 season in a player-coach role.

==Managerial career==
Wilson was appointed manager of Highland League side Wick Academy on 23 October 2012, taking over from former Raith teammate Davie Kirkwood. His first game in charge came against Keith and saw his team run out 5–1 winners, sending them top of the Highland League. Wilson appeared as a substitute on 27 February 2013 during Wick&#x27;s 4–0 victory over title rivals Clachnacuddin to bring them back to the top of the Highland League. Wilson signed a new contract with Wick Academy in March 2013.

Queen of the South offered Wilson their vacant managers position in June 2013, but after discussions Wilson turned down their offer to stay at Wick. Wilson was appointed manager of Elgin City in January 2014. He resigned from that position in November 2014, after losing a Scottish Cup tie against junior club Bo&#x27;ness.

In July 2018, Wilson returned to Inverness Caledonian Thistle as a coach, working with both the first team and the under-18 squad. He later became assistant manager, working along with Billy Dodds, until he was sacked by Inverness in September 2023.

<doc id="609851" wikidata="Q4630977" url="?curid=609851" title="2004 Basra police station bombings">
<text>On 21 April 2004, a series of large car bomb explosions ripped through Basra, Iraq. Seventy-four people died and more than 100 were injured. The attacks were some of the deadliest in southern Iraq since the fall of President Saddam Hussein.

==The attacks==
Three separate bombs exploded outside police stations in central Basra; two in the Ashar area and one in the Old City. In these bombings, many children on passing buses were killed.

A fourth, separate attack also occurred around the same time in the town of Az Zubayr. In the fourth attack, two car bombs exploded, one inside the main entrance to the British military outpost and the second just outside the wire fence surround which killed three Iraqis and wounded five British soldiers of the 1st Battalion, the Royal Welch Fusiliers, one seriously. British forces trying to aid casualties were stoned by crowds and came under fire from Iraqi snipers, while trying to recover the wounded. The crowds blamed the coalition for not doing enough to protect Iraqi citizens from such attacks.

The police reported that the majority of those who lost their lives were non-combatants, who died in a series of bombings. The bombings occurred in close proximity to three police stations in Basra and two others at the Regional Police Academy located in Az Zubayr.

<doc id="609852" wikidata="Q1423790" url="?curid=609852" title="Kingdom of Desire">
<text>Kingdom of Desire is the eighth studio album by Toto, released internationally in September 1992. It is the first album on which guitarist Steve Lukather assumed sole lead vocal duties and the final album to feature drummer Jeff Porcaro, who died during rehearsals for the tour promoting this album, and the last album which involved all the Porcaro brothers together. The album was mixed by Bob Clearmountain and dedicated to Jeff in his memory. The album was released in May 1993 in the United States.

== Background and recording ==
During the tour for &quot;The Seventh One,&quot; lead singer Joseph Williams was fired from Toto. In between &quot;The Seventh One&quot; and &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot;, the band released &quot;Past to Present,&quot; a compilation album which contained four new tracks. Multiple vocalists were considered to replace Williams for the new tracks, including original singer Bobby Kimball (although not included on &quot;Past to Present&quot;, Kimball&#x27;s contribution &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; would ultimately be released on &quot;Toto XX).&quot; At the suggestion of Columbia director of A&amp;R, the band ultimately auditioned South African singer Jean-Michael Byron. Byron was championed by Jeff Porcaro and hired by the band to perform the new tracks on &quot;Past to Present&quot;. Steve Lukather described Byron&#x27;s live performances with Toto as &quot;horrifying.&quot; As a result, not unlike the prior tour with Williams, Lukather was pressed into often assuming lead vocals. Byron became the fourth lead vocalist fired by Toto.

Left once again without a lead singer, the band decided their next album would be performed by the core band, Lukather, Jeff Porcaro, David Paich, and Mike Porcaro, and would be a more rock-oriented record, not unlike their fifth album, &quot;Isolation.&quot; Lukather would assume lead vocals for the album. &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; was recorded throughout most of 1991, primarily written through jam sessions, though two tracks were written by Danny Kortchmar, &quot;Kick Down the Walls&quot; and the title track. The basic tracks and overdubs were done at Skywalker Studios in California with producer Greg Ladanyi and mixed by Bob Clearmountain.

During the recording of &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot;, Toto did a summer tour in Europe, where they played the Montreux Jazz Festival. In addition to classic tracks like &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Over You,&quot; the band performed &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; and &quot;Jake to the Bone,&quot; both of which would appear on &quot;Kingdom of Desire.&quot; A CD, DVD and Blu-ray of the performance was released in 2016 as &quot;Live at Montreux.&quot;

Jeff Porcaro died on August 5, 1992, of heart disease, one month before the release of &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot;. He was 38 years old. AllMusic describes Porcaro as &quot;arguably the most highly regarded studio drummer from the mid-70s to the early 90s.&quot; He would be inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 1993. In live shows, Toto has often dedicated &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; track &quot;Wings of Time&quot; to Porcaro, who wrote the lyrics, and later, to his brother, Mike, who died from complications of ALS on March 15, 2015. The final line from the song&#x27;s chorus can be found on his tombstone at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

== Reception and tour ==
Upon completing the album, Columbia Records executives indicated they were unhappy with &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; and were not going to release it. Lukather has indicated this was the &quot;last straw&quot; between Toto and Columbia and they would immediately start looking to leave the label. Columbia was not willing to release the band and they would record two more albums for the label, &quot;Tambu&quot; and &quot;Mindfields&quot;. &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; was released outside of the U.S. in September 1992 and was well received. Thus, the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Chain My Heart&quot; charted in Europe during the winter of 1992-1993. Eight months later, Columbia relented and also released the album in the U.S. on its Relativity label.

Toto had sold out a number of arena dates in Europe to support &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; prior to the death of Jeff Porcaro. Though devastated by the loss of a founding member and lifelong friend, the band asked Simon Phillips to play drums on the forthcoming tour. The first song the band rehearsed with Phillips was &quot;Hydra&quot; and his performance made a strong impression on Paich, Lukather, and Mike Porcaro. Phillips would become a permanent member of Toto and remain with them for the next 21 years. Toto has credited him with helping them continue on after the tragic loss of Jeff Porcaro.

&quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; has an AllMusic User Rating of two stars.

==Additional notes==
Catalogue: Relativity 1181

An interesting fact is that the lyrics printed on the cassette liner or in the CD booklet have the second chorus of each song translated into a foreign language - German (track 1), Japanese (track 2), Italian (track 3), Swedish (track 4), French (track 5), Dutch (tracks 6 and 9), Danish (track 7), Spanish (track 8), Portuguese (track 10) and Russian (track 11, in the latter case as poetry of decent quality).

<doc id="609853" wikidata="Q4913081" url="?curid=609853" title="Billy Murray (actor)">
<text>William Albert Murray (born 6 October 1941) is an English actor, best known for playing Don Beech in &quot;The Bill&quot; from 1995 to 2004, Johnny Allen in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; from 2005 to 2006, and Captain John Price in the video games &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, and &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot;.

Often known for portraying &quot;hard man&quot; characters, he has also starred in &quot;McVicar&quot; (1980), &quot;Essex Boys&quot; (2000), &quot;One in the Chamber&quot; (2012), &quot;We Still Steal the Old Way&quot; (2016), &quot;Nemesis&quot; (2021) and the &quot;Rise of the Footsoldier&quot; film series (2007–2021).

==Early life==
Murray was born in Forest Gate, Essex and grew up in Upton Park, East London, one of three children of Timothy and Vera Murray; his father was a plasterer, nightclub bouncer and a boxing champion. Murray attended St. Edward&#x27;s Catholic Primary and St Bonaventure&#x27;s Catholic School. After leaving school at fourteen, Murray worked as a shelf-stacker at a Co-Op supermarket in Canning Town and at the local docks cleaning the dirt out of oil tankers. He also had football trials for West Ham United and boxed for the Reggie and Ronnie Kray-owned West Ham Boxing Club. Murray became good friends with the Krays to the extent that he accompanied them on holiday to Spain. The Kray twins paid £400 for him to go to East 15 Acting School as a teenager, because they &quot;liked his attitude&quot;. They never asked for the money back, and Murray later appeared as a character witness for Charlie Kray who had been accused of smuggling cocaine.

==Career==
Murray made his acting debut playing a minor uncredited role in the 1963 film &quot;The Wrong Arm of the Law&quot;, followed by minor uncredited roles in &quot;What a Crazy World&quot; (1963) and &quot;Two Left Feet&quot; (1965). He started playing larger roles in the films &quot;Poor Cow&quot; (1967), &quot;Corruption&quot; (1968), &quot;Up the Junction&quot; (1968) and &quot;Performance&quot; (1970). From the 1970s through to the early 1990s, he made appearances in a wide variety of television series such as &quot;Softly, Softly&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, &quot;The Professionals&quot;, &quot;Minder&quot;, &quot;Bergerac&quot; and &quot;Casualty&quot;. He was also among those considered for the role of Derek &quot;Del Boy&quot; Trotter in the BBC TV series &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; before it finally went to David Jason. Other notable film roles include the role of Joey in the hit 1980 film &quot;McVicar&quot; (1980). 

In 1995, he took on the role of DS Don Beech in the ITV police drama series &quot;The Bill&quot; appearing as a regular cast member from early 1995 to late 2000. This was his second role in the series, as he had previously appeared in an episode as DI Jackson in 1989. In 2001, he reprised the role in a special episode entitled &quot;Beech on the Run&quot;. This was followed by the six-part mini-series &quot;Beech is Back&quot;. In 2004, he made his final appearance as Beech for a guest stint in five episodes, in which his character escaped from prison and is now back &#x27;on the run&#x27;.

In late 2004, he joined the cast of BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; and played gangland figure Johnny Allen. This was Murray&#x27;s second role within the series, as he previously appeared as loan shark Mr. X for four episodes in 1991. Murray&#x27;s character as Johnny Allen made his first appearance on 4 January 2005, and became the show&#x27;s main antagonist upon terrorizing numerous characters on the programme - including Peggy Mitchell; her sons Phil Mitchell and Grant Mitchell; their cousin Billy Mitchell, whom Johnny initially employed in his criminal empire; Phil and Grant&#x27;s ex-lover Sharon Watts; her godmother Pauline Fowler; his daughter&#x27;s best friend Stacey Slater; and even his own henchman Jake Moon. During his time on the show, Johnny killed fellow mob boss Andy Hunter on the show&#x27;s 20th anniversary episode by throwing him from a motorway bridge. His character later arranged for Jake&#x27;s brother Danny Moon to kill Sharon&#x27;s husband Dennis Rickman on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005. He departed from the show in March 2006 when his character was jailed after his daughter Ruby Allen forced him to confess to having Dennis murdered and killing Andy himself. He made a brief return to &quot;EastEnders&quot; in October 2006 when his character was killed off after he succumbed to a heart attack in prison, though not before trying to arrange the death of Ruby&#x27;s boyfriend and Stacey&#x27;s brother Sean Slater upon learning that he plans to extract her family assets. For his performance as Johnny Allen Murray won the &#x27;Best Villain&#x27; award at the British Soap Awards in May 2006.

Following his departure from &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Murray appeared in several British films such as &quot;Rollin&#x27; with the Nines&quot; (2006), &quot;Doghouse&quot; (2009) and &quot;Dead Cert&quot; (2010). He also played Mickey Steele in three films from the &quot;Rise of the Footsoldier&quot; film series, those being &quot;Rise of the Footsoldier&quot; (2007), &quot;Rise of the Footsoldier 3: The Pat Tate Story&quot; (2017) and &quot;Rise of the Footsoldier: Origins&quot; (2021).

He also provided the voice of Captain John Price in the video games &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot; (2007), &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot; (2009) and &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot; (2011) and fronted the adverts for Injury Lawyers 4 U, a compensation claims company in the UK.

Murray&#x27;s later career has mainly consisted of film roles, including &quot;The Rise and Fall of a White Collar Hooligan&quot; (2012), &quot;One in the Chamber&quot; (2012) and &quot;We Still Steal the Old Way&quot; (2016). He headlined the crime film &quot;Nemesis&quot; (2021) and starred alongside Lee Majors, Danny Trejo and Ian Ogilvy in the action-thriller film &quot;Renegades&quot; (2022).

==Personal life==
Murray has four children. A son and daughter from his first marriage to Maureen, and two daughters from his second marriage to Elaine. Jaime Murray, one of his daughters from his second marriage is an actress who is best known for starring in the television series &quot;Hustle&quot;, as well as playing Lila Tournay in season two of &quot;Dexter&quot;.

In 1998, Murray appeared in court after he and three other men allegedly attacked two men who they believed were supplying drugs to their daughters. Murray said that he suffered a nervous breakdown and slept rough on the set of &quot;The Bill&quot; for months as a court order banned him from living in his home county of Essex after he was charged with intimidating a witness involved in the case. He also admitted that the court case had put a strain on his marriage. Murray was cleared of assault, having claimed that at the time he was &quot;suffering from a mouth abscess and a cracked collarbone and was in no condition to hit anyone&quot;.
One of the men attacked was quoted as saying that they wished the case had never gone to court, stating &quot;I deserved everything I got&quot;. In June of that year, his daughter Lizzie almost committed suicide via overdose. She survived and Murray was assured her life wasn&#x27;t in any danger.

In April 2011, it was reported that Murray had been charged with assault of his wife and daughter. In July 2011, it was confirmed that the assault case against Murray had been dropped.

Outside of acting, Murray is involved in property investment and owns and rents out lock-ups, flats and garages across East London.

He is a West Ham United football club fan, and a supporter of the Conservative Party.

<text>Albert Victor Young (August 8, 1899– November 10, 1956) was an American composer, arranger, violinist and conductor. Young was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Music Score of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture for &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; at the 29th Academy Awards in 1957.

==Biography==
Young is commonly said to have been born in Chicago on August 8, 1900, but according to Census data and his birth certificate, his birth year is 1899. His grave marker shows his birth year as 1901. He was born into a very musical Jewish family, his father being a tenor with Joseph Sheehan&#x27;s touring opera company. After his mother died, his father abandoned the family. The young Victor, who had begun playing violin at the age of six, was sent to Poland when he was ten to stay with his grandfather and study at Warsaw Imperial Conservatory (his teacher was Polish composer Roman Statkowski), achieving the Diploma of Merit. He studied the piano with Isidor Philipp of the Paris Conservatory. While still a teenager he embarked on a career as a concert violinist with the Warsaw Philharmonic under Juliusz Wertheim, assistant conductor in 1915–16.

When he graduated from the Warsaw Conservatory, World War I prevented him from returning to the U.S., so he remained in Poland (which was occupied by the Germans), earning his keep by playing with the Philharmonic and in a quartet and a quintet. He also gave lessons. His future wife, Rita Kinel, who met him in late 1918, used to smuggle food to him, for he had neither enough money to buy it nor time to eat it.

He returned to Chicago in 1920 to join the orchestra at Central Park Casino. He then went to Los Angeles to join his Polish fiancée, finding employment first as a fiddler in impresario Sid Grauman&#x27;s Million Dollar Theatre Orchestra then going on to be appointed concert-master for Paramount-Publix Theatres. After turning to popular music, he worked for a while as violinist-arranger for Ted Fio Rito.

In 1930, Chicago bandleader and radio-star Isham Jones commissioned Young to write an instrumental ballad band arrangement of Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;Stardust&quot;, which had been played, up until then, as an up-tempo number. Young slowed it down and played the melody as a gorgeous romantic violin solo which inspired Mitchell Parish to write lyrics for what then became a much-performed love song. Bing Crosby recorded it at least three times: in 1931, 1939, and 1942.

In the mid-1930s, he moved to Hollywood where he concentrated on films, recordings of light music and providing backing for popular singers, including Bing Crosby. His composer credits include &quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;, &quot;Blue Star (The &#x27;Medic&#x27; Theme)&quot;, &quot;Moonlight Serenade (Summer Love)&quot; from the motion picture &quot;The Star&quot; (1952), &quot;Sweet Sue, Just You&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t We Talk It Over&quot;, &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Love Letters&quot;, &quot;Around the World&quot;, &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, &quot;Golden Earrings&quot;, &quot;Stella by Starlight&quot;, &quot;Delilah&quot;, &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Stand a Ghost of a Chance with You&quot;.

==Records==
Young was signed to Brunswick in 1931 where his studio groups recorded scores of popular dance music, waltzes and semi-classics through 1934. His studio groups often contained some of the best jazz musicians in New York, including Bunny Berigan, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, Joe Venuti, Arthur Schutt, Eddie Lang, and others. He used first-rate vocalists, including Paul Small, Dick Robertson, Harlan Lattimore, Smith Ballew, Helen Rowland, Frank Munn, The Boswell Sisters, Lee Wiley and others. One of his most interesting recordings was the January 22, 1932, session containing songs written by Herman Hupfeld: &quot;Goopy Geer (He Plays Piano And He Plays By Ear)&quot; and &quot;Down The Old Back Road&quot;, which Hupfeld sang and played piano on (his only two known vocals).

In late 1934, Young signed with Decca and continued recording in New York until mid-1936, when he relocated to Los Angeles.

==Radio, film and television==
On radio, he was the musical director of &quot;The Old Gold Don Ameche Show&quot; and &quot;Harvest of Stars&quot;. He was musical director for many of Bing Crosby&#x27;s recordings for the American branch of Decca Records. For Decca, he also conducted the first album of songs from the 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, a sort of &quot;pre-soundtrack&quot; cover version rather than a true soundtrack album. The album featured Judy Garland and the Ken Darby Singers singing songs from the film in Young&#x27;s own arrangements. Young often collaborated with Ken Darby and the Singers for radio programs starring the popular Met Opera baritone John Charles Thomsen. He also composed the music for several Decca spoken word albums.

He received 22 Academy Award nominations for his work in film, twice being nominated four times in a single year, but he did not win during his lifetime. He received his only Oscar posthumously for his score of &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; (1956). Thus, Victor Young holds the record for most Oscar nominations before winning the first award. His other nominated scores include &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1936), &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1937&quot; (1936), &quot;Artists and Models&quot; (1937), &quot;The Gladiator&quot; (1938), &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1939), &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; (1943), &quot;The Uninvited&quot; (1944), &quot;Love Letters&quot; (1945), &quot;So Evil My Love&quot; (1948), &quot;The Emperor Waltz&quot; (1948), &quot;The Paleface&quot; (1948), &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949), &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; (1949), &quot;Our Very Own&quot; (1950), &quot;September Affair&quot; (1950), &quot;My Favorite Spy&quot; (1951), &quot;Payment on Demand&quot; (1951), &quot;The Quiet Man&quot; (1952), &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1952), &quot;Something to Live For&quot; (1952), &quot;Shane&quot; (1953), &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (1954), &quot;A Man Alone&quot; (1955), &quot;The Conqueror&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Maverick Queen&quot; (1956).

He contributed two tone poems, &quot;White&quot; and &quot;Black&quot;, to the 1956 album &quot;Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color&quot;.

His last scores were for the 1957 films &quot;Omar Khayyam&quot;, &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot; and &quot;China Gate&quot;, which were released after his death. The last was left unfinished at the time of his death and was finished by his long-time friend Max Steiner.

&quot;The Call of the Faraway Hills&quot;, which Young had composed for the film &quot;Shane&quot;, was also used as the theme for the U.S. television series &quot;Shane&quot;. Young won a Primetime Emmy Award for his scoring of the TV special &quot;Light&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee&quot;, which aired on all four American TV networks on October 24, 1954.

As an occasional bit player, Young can be glimpsed briefly in &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (1954) playing a recording studio leader conducting Bing Crosby while he tapes &quot;The Search is Through (You&#x27;ve Got What It Takes).“

==Death==
Young died on November 10, 1956, in Palm Springs, California, after a cerebral haemorrhage at age 57. He is interred in the Beth Olam Mausoleum in Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood, California. Dr. Max Nussbaum, rabbi of Temple Israel, Hollywood, officiated. His family donated his artifacts and memorabilia (including his Oscar) to Brandeis University, where they are housed today.

<text>Paula Anna Maria Wessely (20 January 1907 – 11 May 2000) was an Austrian theatre and film actress. &quot;Die Wessely&quot; (literally &quot;The Wessely&quot;), as she was affectionately called by her admirers and fans, was Austria&#x27;s foremost popular postwar actress.

==Life and career==
Wessely was born in Vienna, the daughter of butcher Carl Wessely, younger brother of the late Burgtheater actress Josephine Wessely (1860–1887). Like her adored aunt, Paula Wessely prepared for an artistic career. From 1922 she attended the Vienna State Academy of Music and Performing Arts and later the Max Reinhardt Seminar, while she made her debut as an actress in 1924 at the Volkstheater, followed by several minor roles of the boulevard repertoire, also performing at the Raimund Theater.

Her career proceeded, when in 1926, she became a member of the New German Theatre ensemble in Prague, where she and her future husband Attila Hörbiger (1896–1987) performed in &quot;Les Nouveaux Messieurs&quot; by Flers and Croisset. 

In 1927, she returned to the Volkstheater, playing in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Lady from the Sea&quot; and Wedekind&#x27;s &quot;Spring Awakening&quot;. After being denied the role of Jenny in Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Threepenny Opera&quot; in 1929, she quit and joined the ensemble of the Theater in der Josefstadt under director Max Reinhardt. 

Strongly insisting on major roles, she performed in &quot;Der Gemeine&quot; by Felix Salten, together with Attila Hörbiger and Hans Moser. Supported by Reinhardt, she played in Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Intrigue and Love&quot; at the 1930 Salzburg Festival. In 1932, she appeared in Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;Rose Bernd&quot; under director Karlheinz Martin at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, acclaimed by the audience as well as by critics like Alfred Kerr and colleagues like Werner Krauss. 

On 23 December 1932, having taken singing lessons, she played the leading role in the premiere of Fritz Kreisler&#x27;s Singspiel &quot;Sissy&quot; at the Theater an der Wien. From 1933 until 1938 she again performed at the Salzburg Festival as Gretchen in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, together with Ewald Balser. In 1936, she made her first appearance on the Burgtheater stage in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Saint Joan&quot;.

Wessely, who was not particularly photogenic, was passed over in favor of Magda Schneider for the role of Christine in Max Ophüls&#x27; 1933 film version of Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s &quot;Liebelei&quot;, a part she had played at Theater in der Josefstadt. Her first major movie role was that of Leopoldine Dur in the 1934 film &quot;Maskerade&quot; directed by Willi Forst, together with Adolf Wohlbrück. Further appearances in films like &quot;Episode&quot; by Walter Reisch, for which she was awarded the Volpi Cup as best actress at the 1935 Venice Film Festival, finally made her a star. 

Like her brother-in-law Paul Hörbiger, Wessely had publicly acclaimed the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, after which she smoothly continued her film and theatre career. 

Her most notorious movie appearance was in the anti-Polish Nazi propaganda film &quot;Heimkehr&quot; (&quot;Homecoming&quot;) by Gustav Ucicky in 1941. Heavily criticized by Austrian intellectuals after World War II, she later publicly regretted her involvement.

On 23 November 1935, she married Attila Hörbiger at the Vienna Rathaus. They had three daughters: (born 1936), Christiane Hörbiger (born 1938) and Maresa Hörbiger (born 1945). All three daughters went on to become actresses.

After WWII, she was initially under a ban by the Allied authorities. She resumed her career in 1945 at the Innsbruck State Theatre with the role of Christine in &quot;Liebelei&quot;, and again at the Theater in der Josefstadt in Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Good Person of Szechwan&quot; the next year. She participated in the filming of Ernst Lothar&#x27;s novel &quot;The Angel with the Trumpet&quot; in 1947, playing a half-Jewish woman. In 1957 she was again criticized for her role in the homophobic film &quot;Anders als du und ich&quot; (&quot;Different from you and me&quot;) by Veit Harlan. 

Wesselly, along with her husband, worked for many years at the Vienna Burgtheater, performing in Raimund&#x27;s &quot;Der Alpenkönig und der Menschenfeind&quot; and &quot;Der Diamant des Geisterkönigs&quot;, again as Gretchen in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, in Schnitzler&#x27;s &quot;Das weite Land&quot;, in Hofmannsthal&#x27;s &quot;Der Unbestechliche&quot; with Josef Meinrad and as Ella Rentheim in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot;. When Attila Hörbiger died of a stroke in April 1987, aged 91, Wessely, by then undisputed doyenne of the Burgtheater, retired at the age of 80.

In her last years she lived a very secluded life in her hometown Vienna and suffered from major depression, caused by the death of her beloved husband. On 20 January 2000, she celebrated her 93rd birthday quietly, with only her three daughters and grandchildren at her home in Vienna-Grinzing. The following April she suffered an acute attack of bronchitis and was admitted to a hospital in Vienna. She died on 11 May 2000, aged 93, &quot;peacefully in her sleep&quot;, as the Burgtheater management announced the following day. She was buried two weeks later at the side of her husband in an Ehrengrab of the Grinzing cemetery.

<text>&quot;Soomaaliyeey toosoo&quot; (&quot;Somalis, Wake Up&quot;) was the national anthem of Somalia from 2000 until August 2012. It was adopted by the Transitional National Government, replacing the unnamed former national anthem.

Though contested, the majority believe the lyrics of the earlier Somalia National Anthem were composed by Yusuf Haji Adam and Ali Mire Awale.

==History==
&quot;Soomaaliyeey toosoo&quot; is a well-known Somali song that dates from the early 1940s. It was first composed by Yusuf Haji Adam and Cali Mire Cawaale. sometime in the 1940s.

It was sung to mark independence day on July 1, 1960, and was regularly performed by children in the mornings at schools. &quot;Soomaaliyeey toosoo&quot; was officially adopted in July 2000 to mark the 40th anniversary of Somali independence.

In August 2012, following the endorsement of Somalia&#x27;s new Provisional Constitution, &quot;Soomaaliyeey toosoo&quot; was replaced as the national anthem by &quot;Qolobaa Calankeed&quot;.

==Lyrics==
Other version also existed, which is a longer variant.

<text>J.-H. Rosny was the pseudonym of the brothers Joseph Henri Honoré Boex (1856–1940) and Séraphin Justin François Boex (1859–1948), both born in Brussels. Together they wrote a series of novels and short stories about natural, prehistoric and fantasy subjects, published between 1886 and 1909, as well as several popular science works. After 1909, the two brothers ended their collaboration, and Joseph Boex took to signing his works as J.-H. Rosny aîné (J. H. Rosny the Elder), while his brother Seraphin used the name J.-H. Rosny jeune (J. H. Rosny the Younger).

In 1887, the brothers were among the writers who entered a formal protest in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; newspaper against Émile Zola&#x27;s &quot;La Terre&quot;. In 1903, the brothers were named to the first jury for the Prix Goncourt, an influential annual French literary award. They are considered to be among the founders of modern science fiction.

Of the two, the elder brother Joseph (J.-H. Rosny aîné) is somewhat better known and many of the joint Rosny works are incorrectly attributed only to the elder brother. Of their books, &quot;The Quest for Fire&quot; is the best known, especially since it was made into a motion picture of the same name in 1981.

<doc id="609863" wikidata="Q308899" url="?curid=609863" title="Powerslave">
<text>Powerslave is the fifth studio album by the English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, released on 3 September 1984 through EMI Records in Europe and its sister label Capitol Records in North America. It was re-released by Sanctuary and Columbia Records in the United States in 2002.

The songs &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot; and &quot;Aces High&quot; were released as singles. Its cover artwork is notable for its Ancient Egypt theme. That theme, taken from the title track, was carried over to the album&#x27;s supporting tour, the World Slavery Tour. This began in Warsaw, Poland, on 9 August 1984; it is widely regarded as being the band&#x27;s longest and most arduous tour to date, and led to the live album &quot;Live After Death&quot;.

The release contains a musical re-telling of Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, the lyrics of which include some lines from the poem. At 13 minutes and 45 seconds in length, this was Iron Maiden&#x27;s longest song for over 30 years until it was surpassed by the 18-minute &quot;Empire of the Clouds&quot; from the 2015 album &quot;The Book of Souls&quot;.

&quot;Powerslave&quot; is notable as the band&#x27;s first album to feature the same personnel as their previous studio release. This lineup would remain intact for two further studio releases. It is also their last album to date to feature an instrumental piece, and the only one until &quot;Senjutsu&quot; (2021) in which longtime member and guitarist Dave Murray does not have a songwriting credit.

==Background, writing and recording==
Following the conclusion of their highly successful World Piece Tour in December 1983, during which Iron Maiden headlined large venues and arenas in the US for the first time in their career, the band took three weeks off in January 1984, before regrouping at Le Chalet Hotel in Jersey where they rehearsed for six weeks. As with &quot;Powerslave&quot;″s predecessor &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; (1983), this was where most of the album&#x27;s writing took place; the band then began recording it at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas.

Once finished, the band undertook another short break while the album was mixed at Electric Lady Studios, New York, before reconvening in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to rehearse for the World Slavery Tour. The tour began in Poland in August 1984 and ended in California in July 1985. The stage set echoed the album cover, including monumental pedestals several stories high, atop which the musicians appeared at times during the show. The set amply filled even the gigantic proscenium of Radio City Music Hall. The tour was the first time a heavy metal band had taken a full set behind the Iron Curtain, visiting Poland and Hungary, a landmark achievement at the time. It continued into South America – the first time the band had toured there – where they played to an estimated audience of 350,000 at the inaugural Rock in Rio as special guests of the band Queen. The &quot;Live After Death&quot; album and video, recorded over four nights at Long Beach Arena in LA and Hammersmith Odeon in London, were also released; these respectively peaked at No. 2 and No. 1 in the UK charts.

In total, the tour was eleven months long and touched 28 countries. &quot;Powerslave&quot; debuted at No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart, as a result of their record company EMI&#x27;s third &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!&quot; pop compilation. Eventually, Iron Maiden&#x27;s fifth studio album achieved No. 1 in the UK and No. 12 in US.

== Songs ==

As with previous albums, the lyrics were inspired by movies and/or pieces of literature, as well as by historical events.

The leading single &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot;, written by vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith, was inspired by the Doomsday Clock ticking at, precisely, two minutes to midnight following the increasing tensions caused by the Cold War, and specifically by Ronald Reagan&#x27;s anti-Soviet speech &quot;Evil Empire&quot;; according to Smith, it took him and Dickinson about twenty minutes to write the song. Steve Harris wrote the other single (and album opener) &quot;Aces High&quot; inspired by the Battle of Britain and possibly by the 1976 British war film of the same name. In the official video as well as in all live performances, the song was introduced by Winston Churchill&#x27;s 1940 speech &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot;.

&quot;Losfer Words (Big &#x27;Orra)&quot; was Iron Maiden&#x27;s fourth instrumental track and the first they released after &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (from &quot;Killers&quot;, 1981); it also was their first instrumental track released since both Bruce Dickinson and Nicko McBrain joined the band. As it happened with &quot;Transylvania&quot;, the band originally intended to write lyrics for it, but could not find any fitting theme; after having listened to the music, they agreed upon leaving it as it was, and gave it its title as a pun.

Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;Flash of the Blade&quot; was inspired by his passion for fencing, while the closing track of Side A, &quot;The Duellists&quot;, was inspired to Harris by the 1977 British historical drama film of the same name. &quot;Back in the Village&quot;, written by Smith and Dickinson, is a sequel to the 1982 song &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and is based on the British science fiction TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. The album title track, &quot;Powerslave&quot;, is narrated from the point of view of an Egyptian pharaoh wondering why he has to die, he who was considered a god by his people, and was written by Dickinson as a partial allegory of his life as a rock-star. The track was chosen as the album&#x27;s title track and provided the theme for both the cover artwork and the stage decorations.

The album&#x27;s closer and longest track, &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, is an abridgment of Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem of the same name. Bassist and songwriter Steve Harris recalled how, under time pressure, the piece was written in a relatively short space of time. Drawing heavily from Coleridge&#x27;s 1815–16 gloss to his own poem, the song directly quotes two passages, the former including the famous lines: &quot;Water, water everywhere – nor any drop to drink&quot;. At over thirteen minutes long, the track contains several distinct sections with differing moods and would become a fan favourite. During the 2008–09 Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, guitarist Dave Murray, Dickinson and Harris cited the song as their favourite to play live.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Powerslave&quot; received favorable reviews and accolades and was ranked at number 38 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot; in 2017. According to both Nicko McBrain and Adrian Smith, &quot;Powerslave&quot; began making Iron Maiden famous &quot;very fast, very quickly&quot;, such as in Brazil, where hundreds of fans waited outside hotels and restaurants for the band.

In 2024, Iron Maiden celebrated the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary with a limited edition Zoetrope vinyl.

==In other media==

The song &quot;Flash of the Blade&quot; was included on the soundtrack of Dario Argento&#x27;s 1985 horror film &quot;Phenomena&quot;, and was covered by the American band Avenged Sevenfold on their double live album/DVD &quot;Live in the LBC &amp; Diamonds in the Rough&quot; (and was later featured on their greatest hits album). Rhapsody of Fire have also recorded a cover of the song that is featured on the deluxe edition of their album &quot;From Chaos to Eternity&quot;.

<doc id="609865" wikidata="Q1454950" url="?curid=609865" title="Tape head">
<text>A tape head is a type of transducer used in tape recorders to convert electrical signals to magnetic fluctuations and vice versa.They can also be used to read credit/debit/gift cards because the strip of magnetic tape on the back of a credit card stores data the same way that other magnetic tapes do. Cassettes, reel-to-reel tapes, 8-tracks, VHS tapes, and even floppy disks and early hard drive disks all use the same principle of physics to store and read back information. The medium is magnetized in a pattern. It then moves at a constant speed over an electromagnet. Since the moving tape is carrying a changing magnetic field with it, it induces a varying voltage across the head. That voltage can then be amplified and connected to speakers in the case of audio, or measured and sorted into ones and zeroes in the case of digital data. 

==Principles of operation==
The electromagnetic arrangement of a tape head is generally similar for all types, though the physical design varies considerably depending on the application - for example videocassette recorders (VCR) use rotating heads which implement a helical scan, whereas most audio recorders have fixed heads. A head consists of a core of magnetic material arranged into a doughnut shape or toroid, into which a very narrow gap has been let. This gap is filled with a diamagnetic material, such as gold. This forces the magnetic flux out of the gap into the magnetic tape medium more than air would, and also forces the magnetic flux out of the magnetic tape medium into the gap. The flux thus magnetises the tape or induces current in the coil at that point. A coil of wire wrapped around the core opposite the gap interfaces to the electrical side of the apparatus. The basic head design is fully reversible - a variable magnetic field at the gap will induce an electric current in the coil, and an electric current in the coil will induce a magnetic field at the gap.

===Reversibility===
While a head is reversible in principle, and very often in practice, there are desirable characteristics that differ between the playback and recording phases. One of these is the impedance of the coil - playback preferring a high impedance, and recording a low one. In the very best tape recorders, separate heads are used to avoid compromising these desirable characteristics. Having separate heads for recording and playback has other advantages, such as off-tape monitoring during recording, etc.

===Head gap width===
The width of the head gap is also critical - the narrower the gap, the better the head will be - a narrow gap gives much better transcription in the magnetic domain (which equals to more output with high frequency signals in the case with playback heads). The desirability for a narrow gap means that most practical heads are made by forming a narrow V-shaped groove in the back face of the core, and grinding away the front face until the V-groove is just breached. In this way, gaps of the order of micrometres are achievable. 

A record head, on the other hand, has a gap typically six times larger than that of the replay head, this gives a larger flux to magnetise the tape. The ideal gap size in a cassette deck are; wide record head gap and narrow playback head. The larger gap does not affect frequency response because the &#x27;image&#x27; is largely made by the trailing edge of the gap. A combined record/replay head has a compromise size gap typically three times that of a replay only head.

There are also negative aspects of narrow head gaps, particularly for magnetic recording. The narrower the head gap, the more bias signal must be used to maintain linearity of the signal on tape which in turn will reduce the high frequency headroom or SOL (Saturated Output Level), particularly with slower tape speeds. Manufacturers must find a compromise between intended tape speeds and head gaps for this reason.

==Types==
The physical design of a head depends on whether it is fixed or rotating. In either case, the face of the head where the gap is must be made hard wearing and highly smooth to avoid excessive head wear. It can also be seen that due to the construction method of the head gap, head wear will tend to widen the gap, reducing the head&#x27;s performance over time. The vertical alignment of the heads (the azimuth) must also match between recording and playback for good fidelity, and the gap should be as close to exactly vertical as possible for highest frequency response. Most tape transport mechanisms will allow fine mechanical adjustment of the azimuth of the heads. Sometimes this can be achieved by automatic circuitry - the actual mechanical azimuth adjustment being carried out by taking advantage of the piezo effect of certain types of crystal material.

===Rotating heads===
Rotating play heads, as used in video recorders, digital audio tape and other applications, are used to achieve a high relative head/tape speed while maintaining a low overall tape transport speed. One or more transducers are mounted on a rotating drum set at an angle to the tape. The drum spins rapidly compared to the speed that the tape moves past it, so that the transducers describe a path of stripes across the tape, rather than linearly along it as a fixed head does. The wear characteristics of such helical scan heads are even more critical, and highly polished heads and tapes are required. The electrical signals of rotating heads are coupled either inductively or capacitively - there is no direct connection to the head coils.

===Erase heads===

An erase head is constructed in a similar manner to a record or replay head, but has a much larger gap, or more frequently, two large gaps. The erase head is powered during recording from a high frequency source (usually the same oscillator that provides the AC bias). In some inexpensive cassette recorder designs, the erase head is a permanent magnet that is mechanically moved into contact with the moving tape only during recording. Permanent magnet erase heads are also sometimes used in machines that are equipped with DC bias.

=== Cross-field heads ===
Instead of feeding both the bias signal and the audio signal into the same recording head, a few brands of audio tape recorder, notably Tandberg, Akai and its US cousin Roberts, used a separate bias head on the opposite side of the tape from the recording head; this system was termed cross-field.

=== Head materials ===
Record and replay heads are traditionally made of soft iron (the softness is an essential requisite for good record and replay characteristics). This material features extremely good electro-acoustical properties, but wears away fairly rapidly with a consequent deterioration of performance. Some higher end recorders featured heads made from ferrite, which features excellent electro-acoustical properties while being a very hard material which resists wear. Its two main disadvantages are that it is brittle and easily damaged, and that it has a much higher noise output due to the Barkhausen effect. In more recent years, more exotic materials have appeared, some involving ceramics, which offer the best of both of the traditional materials.

== Cleaning ==
With use the head will become dirty with loose tape shedding, and distort the sound. The tape head can be cleaned using a cloth with alcohol. Video head cleaner can be used to clean video, audio, erase, or control track heads.

<text>Rail transport in Ireland (InterCity, commuter and freight) is provided by Iarnród Éireann in the Republic of Ireland and by Northern Ireland Railways in Northern Ireland.

Most routes in the Republic radiate from Dublin. Northern Ireland has suburban routes from Belfast and two main InterCity lines, to Derry and cross-border to Dublin.

The accompanying map of the current railway network shows lines that are fully operational (in red), carrying freight only traffic (in black) and with dotted black lines those which have been &quot;mothballed&quot; (i.e. closed to traffic but potentially easy to re-open). Some airports are indicated but none are rail-connected, although Kerry Airport and Belfast City Airport are within walking distance of a railway station. Both the City of Derry Airport and Belfast International (Aldergrove) are near railway lines but not connected. Ports are marked, although few remain rail-connected. Dublin Port, Larne Harbour, Belview Port and Rosslare Europort are ports that are still connected.

Ireland&#x27;s only light rail service, named Luas, is in Dublin. No metro lines currently exist in Ireland, but there is a planned MetroLink line which would serve Dublin.

==History==

The first railway in Ireland opened in 1834. At its peak in 1920, Ireland had of railway; now only about half of this remains. A large area around the border has no rail service.

Ireland&#x27;s first light rail line was opened on 30 June 2004.

==Rolling stock==
===Locomotives===

Diesel traction is the sole form of motive power in both the IÉ and NIR networks, apart from the electrified Howth/Malahide-Greystones (DART) suburban route in Dublin. Apart from prototypes and a small number of shunting locomotives, the first major dieselisation programme in CIÉ commenced in the early 1950s with orders for 94 locomotives of two sizes (A and C classes) from Metropolitan-Vickers which were delivered from 1955, with a further twelve (B class) locomotives from Sulzer in the late 1950s.
Following poor reliability experience with the first generation diesel locomotives, in the 1960s a second dieselisation programme was undertaken with the introduction of sixty-four locomotives in three classes (121, 141 and 181) built by General Motors, of the United States. This programme, together with line closures, enabled CIÉ to re-eliminate steam traction in 1963, having previously done so on the CIÉ network prior to taking over its share of the Great Northern Railway. In parallel, NIR acquired three locomotives from Hunslet, of England, for Dublin-Belfast services. The Metropolitan-Vickers locomotives were re-engined by CIÉ in the early 1970s with General Motors engines.

The third generation of diesel traction in Ireland was the acquisition of eighteen locomotives from General Motors of 2475 h.p. output, designated the 071 class, in 1976. This marked a significant improvement in the traction power available to CIÉ and enabled the acceleration of express passenger services. NIR subsequently purchased three similar locomotives for Dublin-Belfast services, which was the first alignment of traction policies by CIÉ and NIR.

A fourth generation of diesels took the form of thirty-four locomotives, again from General Motors, which arrived in the early 1990s. This was a joint order by IÉ and NIR, with thirty-two locomotives for the former and two for the latter. They were again supplied by General Motors Electro-Motive Division. IÉ designated their locomotives the GM 201 class; numbered 201 to 234 (the NIR locomotives were later prefixed with an 8). These locomotives are the most powerful diesels to run in Ireland, and are of 3200 horsepower (2.5 MW), which enabled further acceleration of express services. The NIR locomotives, although shipped in NIR livery, were repainted in &#x27;Enterprise&#x27; livery, as were six of the IÉ locomotives.

The 071 class are now used on freight services. NIR&#x27;s three similar locomotives are numbered 111, 112 and 113. There is seldom more than one of these serviceable at a time.

===Multiple units===
NIR and IÉ both run suburban services using diesel multiple units (DMUs) – these are termed railcars in Ireland (see rail terminology).

====Railcars in operation====
IÉ DMUs operate all InterCity services apart from Dublin to Cork and some Dublin to Belfast services

==== Iarnród Éireann 22000 class InterCity railcars ====

There are 234 22000 Class carriages in total, being formed into the following sets:
*Ten 5-car sets – Each set includes a 1st Class Carriage and a Dining Carriage. They are used on key InterCity services between Dublin and Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Westport and Tralee.
*Twenty-five 4-car sets – These mostly operate on their own or with a 3-car unit. They serve lesser-used InterCity services and most Dublin to Sligo and Rosslare services.
*Twenty-eight 3-car sets – These mostly operate in pairs. They serve lesser-used InterCity services and many Dublin Commuter services.

Features of the InterCity railcar fleet include:
*Automatic PA and information display systems
*Electronic seat reservation displays for web bookings
*Fully air-conditioned
*Internal CCTV system
*Sleek carriage design
*Advanced safety features throughout

The primary DMU classes in operation include the 22000, 29000, 2800, 2600, 3000, and 4000 series.

==== Iarnród Éireann 29000 class Commuter railcars ====

Introduced between 2002 and 2005, the 29000 Class consists of 29 four-car sets built by CAF. These units primarily operate on suburban routes in the Greater Dublin area, offering a seating capacity of 185 per set.

==== Iarnród Éireann 2800 class railcars ====

The 2800 Class includes 10 two-car sets constructed by Tokyu Car Corporation in 2000. Initially deployed on regional services, these DMUs have been reassigned to various routes based on operational requirements, each set providing seating for 85 passengers.

==== Iarnród Éireann 2600 class railcars ====

Built by Tokyu Car Corporation and introduced in 1993, the 2600 Class comprises 17 two-car sets. These units were the first modern DMUs purchased for the network and were initially used on suburban services.

==== NI Railways 3000 class railcars ====

The 3000 Class DMUs, manufactured by CAF, were introduced between 2004 and 2005. This fleet consists of 23 three-car sets, each with a seating capacity of approximately 212 passengers.

==== NI Railways 4000 class railcars ====

The 4000 Class DMUs, also built by CAF, entered service between 2011 and 2012. The fleet comprises 20 sets, configured into both three-car and six-car formations. Each three-car set offers seating for 216 passengers, while six-car sets accommodate up to 442 passengers. These units feature enhanced seating capacity and fuel economy compared to earlier models. In 2018, an additional 21 vehicles were ordered to extend train lengths, facilitating longer formations and increased capacity.

===Coaching stock===
====Mark 4 carriages====

Iarnród Éireann&#x27;s flagship InterCity fleet are the Mark 4.

Built by CAF of Spain in 2004–2005 they are formed into 8-car push-pull sets.
Each set contains (in order):
*GM 201 class locomotive
*5 Standard class carriages
*1 restaurant carriage
*1 &#x27;Citygold&#x27; (first class) carriage
*Generator Control Car

The Mark 4 trains have blue tinted windows, which help to create a cool journey for the passenger, electronic route maps showing train progress, electronic seat reservation displays and power points for laptops, or recharging tablets, MP3 players or mobile phones. Citygold customers on this fleet have the added features of adjustable seating, greater room and comfort and in-seat audio entertainment. They are used exclusively on the Dublin to Cork route; operating an hourly service each way.

The Mark 4 trains are capable of speeds of up to , but are limited to a maximum speed of , due to the lines they run on and the locomotives that pull them.

====Enterprise services====
The Dublin to Belfast &#x27;Enterprise&#x27; service is operated jointly by IÉ and NIR with rolling stock from De Dietrich, commissioned in 1997. Four Mark 3 Generator vans were introduced in September 2012. Until then, 201 Class locomotives were required to supply head-end power (HEP) for heating and lighting. Since late 2024, with a timetable change increasing services up to every hour on Enterprise, Translink Class 3000 and Irish Rail 22000 Class trains have also began running on the Enterprise.

====Previous stock====
NIR also had a number of refurbished Class 488 carriages acquired from the Gatwick Express service and converted to run on the Irish gauge. These were generally referred to as &#x27;the Gatwicks&#x27;. They were in use from 2001 until June 2009.

==Passenger services==

Below is a list of all passenger routes on the island of Ireland. Please note the following when examining routes:

# Services below usually, but not necessarily always, involve a change of trains. Changing points are shown in bold type.
# Services at different times of day will serve a different subset of the stations shown below. The &quot;stations served&quot; lists all possible stops for any train on a given route. As an example, some services to Limerick do not involve a change at Limerick Junction, and some services to Cork may stop at Limerick Junction, Charleville and Mallow only.

===Republic of Ireland InterCity routes===
====Dublin to Cork====

Stations served on this line are
* Dublin Heuston
* Portlaoise
* Ballybrophy
* Templemore
* Thurles
* Limerick Junction
* Charleville
* Mallow
* Cork Kent

This was known as the &#x27;Premier Line&#x27; of the Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&amp;WR), being one of the longest routes in the country (266 km or 165 miles), built to a high standard and connecting to Galway, Limerick, Waterford and County Kerry, as well as to Cork. These other destinations all have their own services, although connections are offered to/from the Cork service at Limerick Junction (for Limerick) and Mallow (for Kerry).
As of 2019 the line is receiving a major upgrade focusing this year between Newbridge and Ballybrophy. There are possessions of most sections of the line every night to carry out relaying. There are also disruptions and cancellations on most weekends. All relaying is using a much heavier rail to give a much smoother ride on trains. The new track at 60 kg, is the same that is used on the TGV in France. As the upgrading continues there are speed restrictions which are affecting punctuality of trains. A new platform is under construction at Limerick Junction on the down line which will reduce conflicts and reduce journey times by 3–5 minutes. A fourth track is planned between Park West-Cherry Orchard and Heuston which is also intended to further reduce journey times. As of 2019, 13 out of 29 services on the route daily are delivered in 2 hours 30 mins or under. 11 trains operate the service in between 2 hours 30 mins and 2 hours 35 mins, with all services 2 hours 40 mins or less. An early morning express service from Cork to Dublin makes the non-stop journey in 2 hours 15 mins.

====Dublin to Limerick====
Stations served on this line are:
* Dublin Heuston
* Sallins and Naas
* Newbridge
* Kildare
* Monasterevin
* Portarlington
* Portlaoise
* Ballybrophy
* Templemore
* Limerick Junction
* Limerick Colbert

This service follows the Cork route as far as Limerick Junction. Limerick services leave the main line via a direct curve built in 1967, onto part of the former Waterford and Limerick Railway (W&amp;LR). The former two hourly timetable operated by 22000 Class railcars was cut back in November 2009 when the number of direct trains was reduced to three from Dublin to Limerick and four from Limerick to Dublin. On Sunday there are 6 trains in each direction. The remaining Dublin-Limerick-Ennis services involve a change at &#x27;Limerick Junction&#x27; from a Dublin-Cork or Dublin-Tralee service onto a local train for the remaining 30 minutes of the journey.

====Dublin to Galway====

Stations served on this line are:
* Dublin Heuston
* Sallins and Naas (peak times only)
* Newbridge
* Kildare
* Monasterevin
* Portarlington
* Tullamore
* Clara
* Athlone
* Ballinasloe
* Woodlawn
* Attymon
* Athenry
* Oranmore
* Galway Ceannt

The present route, built by the GS&amp;WR in competition with the MGWR, leaves the Cork main line just after Portarlington. The River Shannon is crossed at Athlone. Athenry, the second last station before Galway, became a junction once again in 2010 with the reopening of the line to Limerick and would do so again if the planned reopening of the line to Tuam proceeds in accordance with Transport 21. In February 2011 planning permission was obtained for a station at Oranmore and opened 28 July 2013.
All services are operated by 22000 Class railcars.

As of 2019, journey times range between 2 hours 11 minutes to 2 hours 37 minutes. 8 services operate in 2 hours 20 mins or less Monday to Friday.
There are 9 direct trains in each direction Monday–Thursday. On Friday the 07:35 express Heuston goes to Westport instead of Galway but there is a connecting train to Galway from Athlone. For the college term there is an extra service from Galway to Dublin at 15:35.

====Dublin to Tralee====
Stations served on this line are:
* Dublin Heuston
* (1 train on Sunday)
* Portarlington (Sundays only)
* Portlaoise
* Thurles
* Limerick Junction
* Charleville
* Mallow
* Banteer
* Millstreet
* Rathmore
* Killarney
* Farranfore
* Tralee Casement

This relatively indirect route runs along what is in essence a branch line connected to the Cork–Dublin mainline at Mallow. Trains run to/from the south of Tralee. As of 2017 there were eight trains from Mallow to Tralee and nine trains the other way around. All services are operated by 22000 Class railcars, with the exception of the very early morning service from Tralee to Cork and some Sunday services (From Tralee to Cork via Mallow) which are operated by a 2-carriage 2600 Class Commuter set. There is one service a day from Dublin Heuston to Tralee in each direction Monday to Friday. On Sunday there is two trains from Heuston to Tralee and three from Tralee to Heuston. Journey times range from 3 hours 40 minutes to 3 hours 53 minutes. On this line, Farranfore railway station provides a direct connection with Kerry Airport.

* Hazelhatch and Celbridge
* Sallins and Naas
* Newbridge
* Kildare
* Athy
* Carlow
* Muine Bheag
* Kilkenny MacDonagh
* Thomastown
* Waterford Plunkett

Since Kilkenny is a stub station, reversal is necessary. Non Passenger trains such as the DFDS Freight train from Ballina to Waterford avoid Kilkenny by using Lavistown loop which joins both lines going into Kilkenny. Some passenger trains use the loop to reducing the journey time.

====Dublin to Westport/Ballina====

* Dublin Heuston
* Newbridge
* Kildare
* Monasterevin
* Portarlington
* Tullamore
* Clara

There is a once-daily morning commuter service from Dundalk Clarke to Bray Daly and another from Drogheda MacBride to Bray Daly. In the evening, there is a once-daily commuter service from Dún Laoghaire Mallin to Dundalk Clarke, as well as a service from Bray to Drogheda MacBride.. On Saturdays and Sundays there are three end to end journeys each way plus a Gorey to Dundalk Commuter service. The 16:37 Dublin Connolly to Rosslare Europort Mondays to Fridays journey offers connectional opportunities into ships to Wales and France. Some peak services also stop at Lansdowne Road station as well and some services skip Kilcoole. This service has the slowest average speed at roughly 53 kilometres per hour. Services are either ICR&#x27;s of 29000 commuter trains.

A resignalling project in Dublin increases the ability of Iarnród Éireann to run 12 to 20 trains per hour in both directions through the Howth Junction to Grand Canal Dock line, which caters for Howth DARTs, Malahide DARTs, Northern Commuter trains, Belfast Enterprise services, Sligo InterCity and Maynooth Commuter services, as well as other services in the Connolly to Grand Canal Dock area.

==== Dublin to Sligo ====

Stations served on this line are:

All services are operated by 22000 Class railcars with a service every 2 hours until 7 pm.
The first Sunday service from Dublin is operated by 29000 Class railcars. This returns from Sligo at 6 pm.

====Cork to Tralee====

Stations served on this line are:
* Cork Kent
* Mallow
* Banteer
* Millstreet
* Rathmore

* Farranfore
* Tralee Casement

This is a three times daily service with two trains departing in the morning and one in the evening. The service is run by a 22000 Class.

Farranfore railway station connects with Kerry Airport.

====Limerick to Waterford====

Stations served on this line are:
* Limerick Colbert
* Limerick Junction
* Tipperary
* Cahir
* Clonmel
* Carrick-on-Suir
* Waterford Plunkett

The Limerick–Waterford route is the only true non-radial (from Dublin) route still open in Ireland that is not a branch line. The route was commenced in 1848 by the Waterford &amp; Limerick Railway and completed in 1854.

Timetabling, as of 2019, requires passengers to change at Limerick Junction. There are two services per day, each way, with no service on Sundays or Public Holidays. Timetabled journey times vary between 2hrs35mins &amp; 2hrs43mins.

====Limerick–Ennis–Galway====

Stations served on this line are:
* Limerick Colbert
* Sixmilebridge
* Ennis
* Gort
* Ardrahan
* Craughwell
* Athenry
* Oranmore
* Galway Ceannt

This service started 30 March 2010 with the reopening of the Ennis–Athenry line. Direct trains now travel from Limerick to Galway with the Ennis commuter services have been subsumed into these.

All of the new stations are unstaffed. Gort has two platforms with lifts, bridges, ticket machines and a loop while Sixmilebridge, Ardrahan and Craughwell have just one platform each. In Gort the signal cabin has been restored and relocated and there is a small depot for permanent way crew. This reopening was the Phase One of the reopening of the Western Rail Corridor. It involved the relaying of 58 km of track, rebuilding bridges, installation of signalling systems, level crossing upgrades and building the stations. The journey time between Limerick and Galway is just under 2 hours and there are 5 trains each way daily.

The line has seen some growth, with the &quot;Irish Times&quot; reporting that from 2013 to 2014, &quot;the western rail corridor saw a 72.5 per cent increase from 29,000 to 50,000 journeys through the Ennis–Athenry section of the line&quot;, which was partly attributed to the introduction of online booking and promotional fares.

* Mallow

==== Cóbh to Cork ====
Stations served on this line are:

* Cork Kent
* Little Island
* Glounthaune
* Fota
* Carrigaloe

* Ennis

====Limerick to Nenagh and Ballybrophy====
Stations served on this line are:
* Limerick Colbert
* Castleconnell
* Birdhill
* Nenagh
* Cloughjordan
* Roscrea
* Ballybrophy

The line branches from the Waterford line just outside Limerick at Killonan Junction. All trains on this line connect with Dublin trains at Ballybrophy.

Current services on the line consist of two return passenger trains a day from Limerick. Following a campaign by The Nenagh Rail Partnership founded by local politicians and community representatives and assisted by the Internet news group Irish Railway News, a market research survey was funded by local Government. The market research was carried out in the summer of 2005 and showed there existed a market for improved services on the line. As a result of this study IÉ has committed to allocating additional rolling stock to the line as part of its ongoing fleet replacement programme. This line is subject to many speed restrictions due to the need to replace several old sections of track.

In October 2007, following a meeting between Iarnród Éireann management and The Nenagh Rail Partnership, it was confirmed that the new commuter service would be introduced between Nenagh and Limerick on Monday 1 September 2008. This was launched as planned on Monday 1 September 2008.

A news report in January 2012 suggested that Iarnród Éireann might seek permission from the National Transport Authority to close the line, but in February 2012 an enhanced timetable for the line was published, indicating that a decision to close has been deferred pending the outcome of the service upgrade.

===Northern Ireland routes===

Services in Northern Ireland are sparse in comparison to the Republic or other countries. A large railway network was severely curtailed in the 1950s and 1960s (in particular by the Ulster Transport Authority). Routes now include suburban services to Larne, Portadown/Newry and Bangor, as well as services to Derry. There is also a branch from Coleraine to Portrush. On Northern Ireland Railways distances are quoted in miles and metres.

====Belfast suburban====
Three suburban routes run on 20-minute frequencies in and out of Belfast Grand Central, these routes then pass through Belfast Lanyon Place before continuing onto destinations at Bangor, Derry and Larne
====Belfast to Derry====

Stations served on this line are:
* Belfast Grand Central
* City Hospital
* Botanic
* York Street (partial service)
* (partial service)
* Mossley West
* 
* 
* 
* 

The service to Derry has suffered from a lack of funding over recent decades. The existing line is not continuously welded and has speed restrictions in parts. For some time the threat of closure hung over this route but a funding package of £20 million was confirmed in December 2005. The same month saw the introduction of the new CAF railcars on the line and despite the fact that the service remained slower than the Derry-Belfast Ulsterbus service, the improvements saw a rise in passenger numbers to over 1 million per annum. However, these in 2007 when it was revealed that the £20 million earmarked had not been spent while there had been a £20 million overspend on the Belfast–Bangor line, and the &quot;Into the West&quot; rail lobby group had proposed extending the line cross border into County Donegal to Letterkenny and then on to Sligo, thus releasing EU funding.
Currently, the department has partly completed a plan in place for Regional Development, for relaying of the track between Derry and Coleraine by 2013, which includes a passing loop, and the introduction of two new train sets. The £86 million plan is expected to reduce the journey time between Belfast and Derry by 30 minutes and allow commuter trains to arrive in Derry before 0900 for the first time.

====Coleraine to Portrush====

Stations served on this line are:
* University
* Dhu Varren

====Belfast to Larne Harbour====
Stations served on this line are:
* Belfast Grand Central
* City Hospital
* Botanic
* York Street
* Whiteabbey
* Jordanstown
* Greenisland
* Trooperslane
* Clipperstown
* Carrickfergus
* Downshire
* Whitehead
* Ballycarry
* Magheramorne
* Glynn
* Larne Town
* Larne Harbour

===Cross-border routes===
====Belfast–Dublin and Dublin–Belfast====

Stations served on this line are:
* Belfast Grand Central
* Lisburn &quot;(1 Train each way on a Sunday)&quot;
* Lurgan &quot;(1 Train each way on a Sunday)&quot;
* Portadown
* Newry
* Dundalk Clarke
* Drogheda MacBride
* Dublin Connolly

This cross border service, named Enterprise, is jointly owned and run by Northern Ireland Railways and IÉ. Despite having some of the most modern InterCity rolling stock on the island, it has been dogged by numerous problems. An historical problem on this route has been disruption to services caused by security alerts (devices on the line, hoax devices, threats and warnings). These continue to the present day.

The punctuality on this service remains poor for other reasons. The InterCity route, despite being mostly high quality continuous welded rail, is shared with suburban services outside both Belfast and Dublin.

A further problem was due to the locomotive and rolling stock arrangements. Unlike most other locomotive-hauled rolling stock in Ireland, generator vans were not part of the train – even the DVTs did not supply power. Thus the General Motors-built locomotives had to supply head-end power for lighting and heating throughout the train. Although many types of locomotive are well designed for this purpose, these particular locomotives had struggled under the extra strain. The wear on the locomotives and time out of service were unusually high. On at least two occasions locomotives had burst into flames while shuttling along the route. To avoid further damage, four Mark 3 Generator Vans entered service in September 2012.

The collapse of the Malahide Viaduct in late 2009 temporarily stopped all Enterprise services from Dublin to Belfast for 3 months. The viaduct was repaired and the line re-opened in November 2009.

==Freight==
The following freight services operate in Ireland :
*Timber trains from Ballina to Waterford Port (Belview)
*Timber trains from Westport to Waterford Port (Belview)
*Zinc ore from Tara Mines, Navan – Dublin Port (North Wall)
*International Warehousing and Transport chartered Liner from Ballina – Dublin Port (North Wall) (Started September 2009)

Rail freight in Ireland declined in the early 21st century, and IÉ closed its container rail freight business in July 2005, saying that the sector had accounted for 10% of its freight business, but 70% of its losses. Container freight levels had dropped to c.35 containers on three trains per day. Yet Iarnród Éireann estimated that a minimum of eighteen 40-foot containers was needed for a commercially viable trainload. The impact of this will be about forty more lorries a day, described by Iarnród Éireann as a &#x27;drop in the ocean&#x27; when compared to the 10,000 lorries entering Dublin Port every day.

Freight services no longer running include ammonia trains (from Shelton Abbey, Wicklow–Cork due to the closure of a fertiliser plant), nationwide bagged cement and beer keg freight, gypsum loads (Kingscourt–Dublin), and bulk cement (from cement factories at Platin near Drogheda and Castlemungret near Limerick to silos at Sligo, Athenry, Cabra, Cork, Waterford, Tullamore and Belfast).

Other losses included services carrying fertilisers, grain, tar, scrap metal, molasses and coal. The last bulk cement flow to operate in Ireland (Castlemungret – Waterford) ended in December 2009 along with the Kilmastulla Quarry – Castlemungret Shale traffic, despite making profits in the region of €1.3 million in 2006.

Remaining freight traffic is supported by an agreement with Coillte to increase timber trains from Ballina to Belview from three to four weekly. This may reflect the failure of the railway to dispose of its surplus Class 201 locomotives made surplus by the retirement of the Mark 3 coach fleet.

Bord na Móna operates an extensive narrow-gauge railway. This is one of the largest industrial rail networks in Europe and is completely separate from Ireland&#x27;s passenger rail system operated by Iarnród Éireann. It is used to transport peat from harvesting plots to processing plants and power stations of the Electricity Supply Board.

==Rail interest groups and museums==

Ireland has a small heritage railway scene, with some substantial and long-running groups operating, while most are small affairs. There are a couple of railtour-operating groups, one self-contained railway, and a few groups with short lines.

===Heritage railways and bodies===
Heritage bodies in Ireland include the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland which is based in Whitehead, County Antrim and also has an operational base in Dublin. It runs preserved steam trains on several main lines around Ireland. Other bodies include the Irish Traction Group, which preserves diesel locomotives including an example at Carrick-on-Suir station, four at Moyasta, and five at the DCDR.

Heritage railways include the:
* Connemara Railway, based at Maam Cross, County Galway, operating a temporary narrow gauge railway
* Downpatrick and County Down Railway, the only self-contained full-size heritage railway in Ireland, running trains along its 4miles of track in addition to its static museum.
* Fintown Railway, which runs a former County Donegal Railways Joint Committee (CDRJC) railbus along the shore of Lough Finn.
* Foyle Valley Railway in Derry, which closed in 2015 but reopened in 2016.
* Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Bushmills Railway, a recreation of the original Giant&#x27;s Causeway Tramway. Steam running ceased at the railway in 2012 with the arrival of a new-build tram.
* Listowel and Ballybunion Railway, a section of the Lartigue Monorail system, has been restored for visitors in Listowel, County Kerry
* Stradbally Woodland Railway, run by the Irish Steam Preservation Society.
* Tralee and Dingle Light Railway, in County Kerry.
* Waterford Suir Valley Railway, which runs 10km of 3ft gauge line between Kilmeadan and Waterford.
* West Clare Railway, with a collection of 5ft3in and 3ft stock based in the restored &#x27;Moyasta junction&#x27; station.

===Interest and record groups===
The Irish Railway Record Society has a library of Irish railway documents at Heuston station and charters an annual railtour. The Modern Railway Society of Ireland promoted interest in modern-day Irish Railways and charters occasional railtours, before it was wound up in 2024.
* Irish Traction Group based at Carrick-on-Suir.
* Railway Preservation Society of Ireland based at Whitehead.

===Museums and historical displays===
There are a number of museums, most concerned with the gauge, and restored railway stations around Ireland:
* Belturbet Railway Station, County Cavan, which is restored as a museum and has several items of rolling stock.
* Castlerea Railway Museum, formerly Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Railway Museum, in County Roscommon.
* Cavan and Leitrim Railway, which has 0.4km of 3ft gauge track and a small transport museum, located next door to Iarnród Éireann&#x27;s Dromod railway station.
* Clonakilty Model Railway Village, County Cork, which has a Ruston diesel and two Park Royal carriages.
* Donegal Railway Heritage Centre, a museum dedicated to the County Donegal Railways Joint Committee housed in the former Donegal railway station.
* National Transport Museum of Ireland, mostly holding wheeled road vehicles but also with trams.
* Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, a major museum which contains various railway and tramway vehicles of numerous gauges from across Ireland.

=== Former heritage railways and interest groups ===
* Clonmacnoise and West Offaly Railway, which closed in 2008.
* Shane&#x27;s Castle Railway, County Antrim, which ran from 1971 to 1994/5, and was partly reused at the Giant&#x27;s Causeway.
* Tralee and Blennerville Railway, which closed in 2006, and again in 2013, though the line still exists.

==Planned and potential developments==
===Routes===

==== All Island Strategic Rail Review ====
A public consultation for a cross-border review of the inter-city railway network was launched jointly by the Irish Minister for Transport and Northern Irish Minister for Infrastructure in November 2021, with over 8,000 responses to the consultation. A draft report of the Rail Review was published on 25 July 2023. The review recommended the reopening of many lines, and the creation of new lines, particularly in the northwest. It also recommended doubling and electrifying numerous stretches of track, and the creation of quadruple track and alternative routes to separate intercity from suburban services close to Dublin and Belfast. The review envisages the reopening of an alternative route from Belfast to Derry via the old “Derry Road”, as well as the Portadown to Mullingar line in the medium term.

==== Western Rail Corridor ====
The first stage of the reopening of the Western Rail Corridor, between Ennis and Athenry, was completed in 2009. The section between Athenry and Claremorris is recommended to be opened under the All Island Strategic Rail Review, and has been proposed by the Government as part of the Trans-European Transport Network. The section between Claremorris and Collooney was not included under the All-Island Strategic Rail Review.

====Dublin-Navan railway line====
Phase One of the Dublin–Navan railway line was completed by Iarnród Éireann in September 2010, with Dublin&#x27;s Western Commuter services travelling as far as Dunboyne and the M3 Parkway railway station. Phase Two of the line, connecting M3 Parkway to Navan via Dunshaughlin and Kilmessan, was deferred following the Post-2008 Irish economic downturn. The status of this proposal was downgraded from “implementation” to “review” in August 2019. Construction of line was included under the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area, 2022-2042.

====Waterford to Rosslare (closed)====

Prior to 2010, there was a single service each way from Waterford to Rosslare stretch, operated by 2700 Class railcars taking just over 1 hour. The service closed for passenger services on 18 September 2010. 
The reopening of the line is recommended to be opened under the All Island Strategic Rail Review, and has been proposed by the Government as part of the Trans-European Transport Network.

====DART and DART Underground====

A proposed tunnel, connecting Heuston Station and Pearse Station and onwards to the Northern Commuter line, referred to as the DART Underground, is not planned to see any development until sometime &quot;after 2042&quot;, but is recommended as a long-term intervention under the All-Island Strategic Rail Review.

====Foynes Port====
The Shannon Foynes Port Company has been seeking reinstatement of the Limerick to Foynes Railway Line, which last operated in 2000, as part of their expansion plans. The route is under reconstruction and is due for reopening for freight in early 2024. Passenger services on the route are envisaged under the All-Island Strategic Rail Review.

====Dublin Metro====

MetroLink is proposed to run from a stop, Estuary, near Swords north of Dublin to the Beechwood Luas stop south of the city centre, via Dublin Airport and St. Stephen&#x27;s Green. Its route proposes mainly elevated tracks in the greater Swords area, with a tunnel running from north of Dublin Airport to Charlemont. As of July 2022, the project was proposed to begin construction in and that, &quot;all going well&quot; it could be in operation by 2035.

====Luas====
There have been, at various points, plans or proposals to extend Luas to Swords, Dublin Airport, Lucan, Bray, and Old Fassaroe.

There have also been proposals to create a Luas-style system in Cork City. These include plans by Cork City Council, published within the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy document in 2019.

====Northern Ireland Railways====
The potential to reopen a number of railway lines in Northern Ireland has included speculation on such lines as the line between Antrim and Castledawson.

The reopening of the third line between Belfast Grand Central and Adelaide is suggested.

In July 2020, during a North/South Ministerial Council meeting, it was proposed to undertake a feasibility study on a possible high-speed line between Belfast and Cork via Dublin.

===Station changes===
In February 2018 the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; reported that the National Transport Authority favoured building four new DART stations, three linked to a new DART operation from Heuston, including near Cross Guns Bridge in Cabra, within Glasnevin, and at a Docklands location, along with a new station north of Bray, at Woodbrook. Calls to open or reopen stations on existing lines have been floated over the years, including Kishoge railway station, which was structurally completed in 2009 but only opened in August 2024.

In Northern Ireland, Translink have opened new transport hubs in both Belfast (2024) called Belfast Grand Central Station and Derry (2021) called the Northwest Transport Hub.

===Rolling stock===
In 2017, increasing demand led Iarnród Éireann to issue tenders for the refurbishment of 10 2700 class sets, which had been held in storage for 6 years with the intention of planned use around Limerick from early 2019. The displaced trains are intended for use in the Greater Dublin Area.

As of early 2018, Iarnród Éireann announced plans to procure new DART trains capable of operating on both diesel and electric power. In 2021, supported by the National Transport Authority, Iarnród Éireann partnered with Alstom to develop new electric and battery-electric trains, which are scheduled to enter service in 2026.

As of 2018, NI Railways had plans to invest in a third wave of new trains to meet growing demand.

As of 2018, a campaign was underway to preserve four 80 Class vehicles at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway, with hopes of bringing them to the heritage railway by the end of 2018. Also in 2018, one of the two Cavan and Leitrim Railway steam locomotives, No. 3 &quot;Lady Edith&quot;, was proposed to be repatriated by the West Clare Railway (from the New Jersey Museum of Transportation).

<text>Cairo University () is Egypt&#x27;s premier public university. Its main campus is in Giza, immediately across the Nile from Cairo. It was founded on 21 December 1908; after being housed in various parts of Cairo, its faculties, beginning with the Faculty of Arts, were established on its current main campus in Giza in October 1929.

The university was known as the Egyptian University from 1908 to 1940, and King Fuad I University and Fu&#x27;ād al-Awwal University from 1940 to 1952. The university is the second oldest institution of higher education in Egypt after Al-Azhar University, notwithstanding the pre-existing higher professional schools that later became constituent colleges of the university.

The university was founded and funded as the Egyptian University by a committee of private citizens with royal patronage in 1908 and became a state institution under King Fuad I in 1925. In 1940, four years following his death, the university was renamed King Fuad I University in his honor. It was renamed a second time after the 1952 Egyptian revolution. The university currently enrolls approximately 155,000 students in 20 faculties and 3 institutions. It counts three Nobel Laureates among its graduates and is one of the 50 largest institutions of higher education in the world by enrollment.

==History==
Before he retired in 1907, the British representative in Egypt, Lord Cromer, remained opposed to establishing of higher education in the country for fear that it would foment unrest. The university opened as a small private institution in 1908. Its early founding and location made it a model for later universities throughout the Arab world. It was taken over as a state university in 1925 and became Cairo University in 1954.

The university was founded on 21 December 1908, as the result of an effort to establish a national center for higher education. Several constituent colleges preceded the establishment of the university including the College of Engineering () in 1816, which was shut down by the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan, Sa&#x27;id Pasha, in 1854. Cairo University was founded as a European-inspired civil university, in contrast to the religious university of Al Azhar, and became the prime indigenous model for other state universities. In 1928, the first group of female students enrolled at the university.

On 27 January 2020, Egypt&#x27;s High Administrative Court approved Cairo University&#x27;s decision to ban its professors from wearing the niqab or face veil which was introduced in 2015.

==Foundation==
At the turn of the century, Egyptian intellectuals and public figures began making calls to establish an Egyptian institute of higher education to provide a modern, professional education to Egyptians. Armenian bureaucrat Yaqub Artin made the first known published reference to establishing an Egyptian university in 1894. In a report, he suggested &quot;the existing higher professional schools could well provide the basis for a university.&quot; These higher schools included the School of Management and Languages, established in 1868 (which became the School of Law in 1886), the School of Irrigation and Construction (known as the School of Engineering) in 1866, Dar al-Ulum in 1872, the School of Agriculture in 1867 and the School of Antiquities 1869.

Syrian journalist Jurji Zaydan called for an &quot;Egyptian college school&quot; (madrasa ) in 1900 in his monthly magazine Al-Hilal. He provided two models for this institute of higher education: the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, India, which delivered a Western-style education in the English language, or the Syrian Protestant College (now the American University of Beirut) in Beirut, run by American missionaries. The new school would provide an alternative to the student missions to Europe begun under Muhammad Ali. Controversy surrounding Zaydan&#x27;s publications would later prevent him from taking a teaching post at the university. A number of other prominent Egyptians played a role in the university&#x27;s foundation. A collection of large landowners, bureaucrats, members of the royal family, and journalists, lawyers, and school teachers including Mustafa Kamil, disciples of Muhammad Abduh such as Qasim Amin and Saad Zaghlul, and eventually Khedive Abbas II and Prince Ahmad Fu’ad I became involved. As Donald M. Reid writes, &quot;Royalist partisans stressed Fu&#x27;ad&#x27;s founding role, Watanists (supporters of the National Party) pointed out Mustafa Kamil&#x27;s call for a university, and Wafdists emphasized the contributions of Saad Zaghlul, Muhammad Abduh, and Qasim Amin.&quot;

Wealthy Egyptians began to independently pledge funds to the establishment of a university as early as 1905. Significant contributions were made by Princess Fatma Ismail. In the early 1900s, she donated land to the university as a part of her fundraising campaign for the establishment of Egypt&#x27;s first formal university. Following the Denshawai incident, Mustafa Kamil al-Ghamrawi, a wealthy notable from Beni Suef, pledged 500 Egyptian pounds towards a university in September 1906. Mustafa Kamil published a call for supplementary funds, while Saad Zaghlul and Qasim Amin arranged a meeting attended by Muhammad Farid and 23 other prominent Egyptians. The members of the meeting founded a committee with Zaghlul as vice-president and Amin as secretary, and all but three pledged at least 100 Egyptian pounds towards the university. However, splinters quickly emerged between the Watanists, the disciples of Abduh and the Royalists, leaving the project in the hands of the Palace. By the time of its establishment in 1908, Prince Fuad I was the rector, and only one of the men who had met in 1906 remained in the committee.

Concerning the faculty of engineering In 2006, the college began implementing the credit hour system by launching the following programs: construction engineering, computer and telecommunications engineering.

In 2007 programs that were developed: mechanical design engineering, architecture engineering and construction technology and petrochemical engineering.

In 2008, it introduced a program: Construction Engineering.

In 2009, it introduced the Water and Environmental Engineering Program.

==Challenges to foundation==

The British colonial government, particularly Lord Cromer, had long opposed the establishment of such a university. Only a year after his departure from Egypt, under Sir Eldon Gorst, was the Egyptian University finally established. The Egyptian educational system remained neglected by the colonial government under the direction of Lord Cromer. Two decades after the establishment of British rule, education received less than 1 percent of the state budget. Cromer publicly stated that free public education was not an appropriate policy for a nation such as Egypt, although the funds were found to refurbish the law school in Cairo so Egyptians did not have to go abroad to obtain legal degrees during Sir John Scott&#x27;s time as Judicial Advisor to the Khedive. Donald M. Reid speculates that this was due to fear that European-style education would foment political unrest or nationalistic sentiments. Cromer also opposed providing financial aid to the university after the private committee began to pursue the matter independently of the colonial government.

In its early years, the university did not have a campus but rather advertised lectures in the press. Lectures would be held in various palaces and conference halls. After a grand opening ceremony in 1908, it remained on financial insecure footing for a number of years, nearly collapsing during World War I. Upon its founding in 1908, the Egyptian University had a women&#x27;s section but this was closed in 1912. Women were first readmitted to the arts faculty in 1928.

Problems during this period also included a lack of professional faculty to fulfill the founders&#x27; educational vision. There were simply no Egyptians with doctoral degrees, the ability to teach in Arabic and a familiarity with Western literature in their fields with whom to fill professorial posts. Thus European Orientalists who lectured in classical Arabic filled many posts until the 1930s. The university also sent its own students on educational missions to obtain the necessary training. First, the university hired Italians Carlo Nallino, David Santillana and Ignazio Guidi, due to King Fuad I&#x27;s connections with Italy. Following the departure of the Italians after the invasion of Libya, French orientalists Gaston Wiet and Louis Massignon took up posts on the faculty. The Germans and British were less represented.

In 1925, the university was re-founded and expanded as a state institution under Fuad I. The liberal arts college (kulliyat al-adab) of 1908 was joined with the schools of law and medicine, and a new faculty of science was added. Ahmed Lutfi al-Sayyid became the first president.

==Ranking==

Cairo University is usually ranked among the best universities in Egypt, and one of the top universities in Africa.

In QS ranking 2021, Cairo University was ranked the 2nd in Egypt and the 6th across Africa, and it was rated 561-570 worldwide.

In the ARWU 2020 ranking, the university was ranked 1st in Egypt. It was rated 401-500 worldwide.

According to the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) 2020–21, the university was ranked 1st in Egypt, and the 558th worldwide.

==Structure==
Cairo University includes a School of Law and a School of Medicine. The Medical School, also known as &quot;Kasr Alaini&quot; (, Qasr-el-&#x27;Ayni), was one of the first medical schools in Africa and the Middle East. Its first building was donated by Alaini Pasha. It has since undergone extensive expansion. The first president of Cairo University, then known as the Egyptian University, was Professor Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed, who served from 1925 to 1941.

After the Egyptian University&#x27;s establishment in 1908, all Institutions of higher education that were in Egypt at the time became a part of the university (except Al-Azhar), like Kasr Alainy (Medical School), Muhandess Khana (School of Engineering), Dar Al-Uloom (House of Science) and others that were established by Muhammad Ali Pasha. They became Faculties of the university after joining (e.g. the &quot;Faculty of Medicine&quot; or &quot;Faculty of Engineering&quot;). Other Faculties were later founded by the university after the eight schools joined.

<text>Tony Drago ( ; born 22 September 1965) is a Maltese former professional snooker and pool player.

Known for his speed around the table, during his snooker career he won two professional titles: the 1993 Strachan Challenge Event 3 and the 1996 Guangzhou Masters. He later switched his focus to pool and won the 2003 World Pool Masters beating Hsia Hui-kai 8–6 and the 2008 Predator International 10-ball Championship beating Francisco Bustamante 13–10.

==Snooker career==

Drago&#x27;s highest snooker world rankings position was number ten (in 1998). He has reached two major finals — the 1991 World Masters (losing to Jimmy White), and the 1997 International Open (losing to Stephen Hendry — Drago&#x27;s only ranking event final, and his first run past the quarter-finals of any ranking event). He reached the quarter-finals of the World Championship in 1988. He has appeared in the tournament 11 further times, most recently in 2004/2005, with five further last-sixteen runs. He lost to Matthew Stevens in three successive years — 8-13 in the last 16 in 1999, 2-10 in the 2000 first round, and 1-10 in the 2001 first round.

After he failed to qualify for the 2004 World Championship, Drago&#x27;s snooker form slumped badly. He dropped out of the top 32 of the rankings a year later, and, after losing to Issara Kachaiwong in his opening qualifier for the 2008 World Championship, he dropped off the tour.

In 2009, Drago won the EBSA International Open, which gave him the chance to return for the 2009–10 season. He reached the third qualifying round of the Shanghai Masters, Grand Prix, and 2009 UK Championship. He then qualified for the Welsh Open, by defeating Simon Bedford (5–3), Peter Lines (5–2), Jimmy Michie (5–2), and Gerard Greene (5–2), where he played against Ryan Day in the first round, but he lost 4–5. In the China Open qualifying, Drago defeated Lee Page (5–2), John Parrott (5–2), Anthony Hamilton (5–4), and Stephen Lee (5–2), to qualify for the televised stages of the China Open. As a result of such a solid season, he got a place in the top 64 and finished 54th.

2010/2011 was again a good season for Drago, as he climbed 8 places to finish 46th in the rankings. However, the 2011/12 season was much worse, with only four qualifying wins to his name. His best results were reaching the last 32 of several of the PTC events. After unexpectedly losing 7–10 to amateur Justin Astley in the 2012 World Snooker Championship qualifiers, Drago finished the season ranked 65th, not making it into the top 64 guaranteeing their place for the next season; however, he was given a wildcard for the next season as a European nomination, along with young Luca Brecel. Drago could not qualify for any of the ranking events during the 2012–13 season. He made headlines in his qualifying match against Alan McManus for the German Masters, when, upon being told he would be fined £250 for conceding the match early, he slapped himself in the face a number of times. Drago finished the year ranked world number 82.

His first match of the season was against Adam Duffy in the qualifying round for the 2013 Wuxi Classic; Drago lost the match 2–5. In the qualifying rounds for the 2013 Australian Goldfields Open, Drago defeated Christopher Keogan 5–2 and Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 5–4, making a crucial 75 break in the deciding frame. In the third qualifying round, Drago was trailing Tian Pengfei 1–3, before winning four consecutive frames, including a 111 break, to win the match 5–3; however, he lost in the final qualifying round 3–5 to Ryan Day, despite leading 2–0 and 3–2.

Drago lost his place on the tour at the end of the 2015/16 season and he failed to qualify for the main tour in that season&#x27;s Q School.

In 2020 Drago was once again selected for the Seniors World Championship. However, on the counsel of his personal doctor, he refused the offer due to the COVID-19 pandemic ongoing at the time.

Drago returned to televised snooker in the 2023 World Seniors Championship where he beat both Vito Puopolo and world number 64 Mark Davis to reach the semi finals where he lost to eventual champion Jimmy White. One year later, he again reached the semi finals, where he once again lost to the eventual champion, Igor Figueiredo.

==Pool career==
Drago&#x27;s first major pool win was the 2003 World Pool Masters, which came just a few weeks after a run to the semi-finals of that year&#x27;s World Pool Championship.

Drago was member of the winning European team at the 2007 and 2008 Mosconi Cup. At 2007 in Las Vegas, Drago won all of his single matches which earned him the &quot;Most Valuable Player Award&quot;.

In 2008, Drago won the Predator International 10-ball Championship, beating Francisco Bustamante 13–10.

==Accomplishments==
Drago is well known for the speed of his play, and holds a number of records resulting from this. In 1993 he recorded the fastest ever best-of-9-frames snooker victory by beating Sean Lanigan in just thirty-four minutes at the 2nd leg of the Strachan Challenge. He also holds the record for the fastest best-of-17 match, beating Joe O&#x27;Boye 9–0 in 81 minutes at the 1990 UK Championship. Conversely, he lost 4–13 against Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the second round of the 1996 World Championship in just 167 minutes and 33 seconds, an all-time Crucible record and less than 9 minutes per frame. In the 1996 UK Championship he made a century break in just three minutes and thirty-one seconds against John Higgins. In the third round of the 1988 Fidelity Unit Trusts International he won the fifth frame 62–0 in just 3 minutes. In 1995, he made a break of 149 in practice against Nick Manning in a snooker club in West Norwood, London. Drago was left snookered after a foul and potted the brown as a free ball and again as the colour, before potting the fifteen reds with thirteen blacks, a pink and a blue, and all the colours.

==Playing style==

His combination of exceptionally fast play and emotional temperament has made him a popular character in snooker, although he was famously criticised by Steve Davis for hurling his cue at the table and storming out of the arena following his 1–5 quarterfinal defeat to Mark Bennett in the 1996 Grand Prix, with Drago later accusing his opponent of bad sportsmanship, because the latter had twice in the match suggested that Drago missed the object ball deliberately while snookered. Similarly, he became visibly angry with Peter Ebdon during their second round match in the 2003 World Championship, in which Ebdon repeatedly left the arena between frames. Drago took this as an attempt to disrupt the flow of his game, but apologised publicly when he later found out that Ebdon had been ill during the match.

His style has earned him the nickname &quot;the Tornado&quot;.

<doc id="609878" wikidata="Q3231807" url="?curid=609878" title="The Naked Now">
<text>&quot;The Naked Now&quot; is the third episode of the first season of the American science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&quot; originally aired on October 5, 1987, in broadcast syndication in the United States. Directed by Paul Lynch, the episode was written by D. C. Fontana, under the pseudonym of &quot;J. Michael Bingham&quot;, based on an unfinished teleplay by Gene Roddenberry. It is a sequel to the original series &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Naked Time&quot; (1966), and that episode&#x27;s writer John D. F. Black also received a writing credit on this episode for his role in devising the plot&#x27;s origins.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. In this episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew becomes infected with an illness that causes them to lose their inhibitions and behave irresponsibly, the same affliction suffered by the crew of the previous USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; decades before in &quot;The Naked Time&quot;. Fans initially criticized the origins of the episode, and later reviews were also largely negative.

==Plot==
The crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; responds to messages received from the SS &quot;Tsiolkovsky,&quot; a science vessel monitoring the collapse of a supergiant star. The messages suggest, amid their rounds of laughter, that the crew has been exposed to a sudden hull breach. After the &quot;Enterprise&quot; secures the &quot;Tsiolkovsky&quot; via tractor beam, an away team beams over and finds that the bridge&#x27;s emergency hatch was indeed blown, ejecting the bridge crew into space, and the remaining crew frozen to death in various stages of undress, including one who was taking a shower fully clad. A woman&#x27;s body, frozen, falls into Lt. La Forge&#x27;s (LeVar Burton) hands. Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) orders full medical examinations of the away team on their return, and finds La Forge sweating profusely and complaining about the temperature. She orders him to stay in sickbay, but he wanders out while she is studying his test results, and makes his way to the quarters of Crusher&#x27;s son, Wesley (Wil Wheaton). Unaware of La Forge&#x27;s condition, Wesley shows him a portable tractor beam device and La Forge places an encouraging hand on his shoulder. Meanwhile, acting on a hunch by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes), who had read up on past starships named &quot;Enterprise&quot; that included an event involving illness and showering fully dressed, Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) locates a historical record identifying the ailment as similar to one encountered by Captain Kirk&#x27;s USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. La Forge returns to sickbay, where Dr. Crusher quickly becomes concerned when she realizes that the infection is spread by physical contact. Many of the ship&#x27;s crew come under the influence of the ailment, with much sexier results than on Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Most notably, a &quot;fully functional&quot; Data engages in a sexual encounter with Security Chief Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby). Dr. Crusher, struggling against the effects of the ailment, finds the original antidote documented by Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot; to be ineffective, and begins devising a new version of it.

Now infected, Wesley uses a digital sample of Captain Picard&#x27;s voice to lure key engineering crew members away from the engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a child-like manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out of its way. Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley&#x27;s force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports that he will not have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship&#x27;s tractor beam, repelling the &quot;Enterprise&quot; off the &quot;Tsiolkovsky,&quot; giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips and enabling the ship to move out of the way. The crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.

==Production==
&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&#x27;s&quot; creator, Gene Roddenberry, wanted to include an episode revealing the characters&#x27; motivations to the audience early on in the series. As a basis, he turned to the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;The Naked Time.&quot; Executive producer Rick Berman described &quot;The Naked Now&quot; as &quot;a homage, not a copy&quot; of &quot;The Naked Time&quot;, while director Paul Lynch described it as &quot;slightly more adult and a lot more comic than the original&quot;.

&quot;The Naked Now&quot; is based on an incomplete teleplay by Roddenberry for &quot;The Next Generation,&quot; titled &quot;Revelations&quot;. The first few scenes remained largely similar, but in &quot;Revelations&quot;, La Forge infected Yar while making unsuccessful sexual advances toward her. In the original series, writer D.C. Fontana wrote a new draft of the teleplay with several further changes that failed to make it into the final installment. These included Data turning down Yar&#x27;s sexual advances, Troi&#x27;s lack of privacy due to empathic abilities, Picard&#x27;s concern for the families on the ship, and Riker&#x27;s fear of becoming a lonely starship captain.

Brooke Bundy made her only appearance as the first chief engineer of the &quot;Enterprise,&quot; Sarah MacDougal, in this episode. The post of chief engineer changed hands numerous times through the rest of season one before Geordi La Forge was finally assigned the post on a permanent basis in season two. Michael Rider made his first appearance as an unnamed transporter chief, but his scene was cut in this episode. He went on to appear in the same role twice more before appearing a final time as the same security guard.

The SS &quot;Tsiolkovsky&quot; model was a redress of the USS &quot;Grissom&quot; from &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984). Michael Okuda created a ship&#x27;s dedication plaque for the &quot;Tsiolkovsky&quot; that stated that it had been created in the Soviet Union. A copy was subsequently sent for display at the Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky State Museum of the History of Cosmonautics in Kaluga, Soviet Russia.

==Reception==
&quot;The Naked Now&quot; aired in broadcast syndication during the week commencing October 3, 1987. It received Nielsen ratings of 11.5, reflecting the percentage of all households watching the episode during its timeslot. This was lower than the pilot, but higher than the following episodes until &quot;Lonely Among Us&quot; in October 1987.

The initial reaction of some fans was dismay, as concerns arose that &quot;The Next Generation&quot; would continue to lift stories from the original series. Staff writer Maurice Hurley said of &quot;The Naked Now&quot;, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like that show at all. It just wasn&#x27;t very good. What it did show, though, was that the new ensemble could interact, and that relationships existed between them that worked, but doing it was terrible. It was a warmed-over premise. Why do it?&quot; The liaison between Data and Yar stood out as being controversial, with Data referring to himself as being &quot;fully functional&quot; in a sexual sense.

Several reviewers rewatched the episode after the end of the series. Keith DeCandido reviewed it on behalf of Tor.com, comparing it to &quot;The Naked Time&quot; and stating, &quot;there&#x27;s nothing in this episode as entertaining as Sulu bare-chested with an epee, and Wesley being nerdy in the engine room is nowhere near as much fun as Riley singing.&quot; He gave the episode a score of two out of 10, remarking, &quot;it&#x27;s rarely a good idea to do an episode where everyone acts out of character as only the second one out of the gate, since we don&#x27;t know enough about these people for their acting strange to be meaningful.&quot; Cast member Wil Wheaton rewatched the episode for AOL TV, and summed it up saying, &quot;whether it was the worst episode ever or not probably rested upon the viewer&#x27;s expectations. Trekkies who were looking for reasons to hate &quot;The Next Generation&quot; found plenty&quot;, while &quot;viewers who were willing to watch it with an open mind saw flashes of things they came to love watching,&quot; and gave it a score of D+.

James Hunt wrote about &quot;The Naked Now&quot; for the website Den of Geek, stating that he could not understand why someone would want to show the characters acting out of character in only the second episode (not counting the pilot) of the series, before the viewers had a baseline from which to understand why the characters&#x27; behavior was abnormal. He praised the idea of connecting &quot;The Next Generation&quot; to &quot;The Original Series&quot; early in the series, but also remarked, &quot;however you slice it up, this episode is pretty awful.&quot; Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website Jammer&#x27;s Reviews remarked, &quot;there&#x27;s a certain memorable quality to this episode, despite its campy, overplayed comedy&quot;, but that &quot;ultimately, the show is too goofy for its own good, but it&#x27;s at least not boring,&quot; awarding it a score of two and a half out of four.

Writing for TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green thought that the episode would have been improved if it had come a few seasons later, by which time the characters were better known to the audience. She also argued that the plot&#x27;s synopsis would have worked better had it been used for an episode in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager.&quot; She thought that the episode was &quot;boring, because we already know how it&#x27;s going to end, and it&#x27;s trivial, because already we can see how easily this crew can be diverted from duty.&quot; Zack Handlen reviewed &quot;The Naked Now&quot; for &quot;The A.V. Club.&quot; He gave the episode a grade of D−, and his criticism of the episode included describing the scene with Yar and Data as &quot;colossally misjudged&quot;, as well as attacking Wesley Crusher&#x27;s &quot;twerpitude&quot;. CBR ranked the relations between Data and Tasha Yar as one of the top-three &quot;cringe-worthy&quot; relationships on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, noting that Tasha taking an interest in Data when intoxicated by polywater was uncomfortable.

In 2016, SyFy included this episode in a group of &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise episodes they felt were commonly disliked, but &quot;deserved a second chance&quot;.

In 2016, the podcast &#x27;The Greatest Generation&#x27;, hosted by Benjamin Harrison and Adam Pranica, utilise the character Jim Shimoda as they discuss each episode of the series. In each episode the hosts identify their &#x27;Drunk Shimoda&#x27;, based on criteria including acting strangely, having a lot of fun or behaviour like that of someone inebriated.

In 2019, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked &quot;The Naked Now&quot; the sixth-funniest episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted this episode was one of the most bizarre episodes of the series.

==Home-media release==
The first home-media release of &quot;The Naked Now&quot; was on VHS cassette, appearing on September 5, 1991, in the United States and Canada. This was followed by a Laserdisc release on October 10, 1991. The episode was later included on the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; season one DVD box set, released in March 2002, and then released as part of the season one Blu-ray set on July 24, 2012.

Episodes from &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; to &quot;Datalore&quot; were released in Japan on LaserDisc on June 10, 1995, as part of &quot;First Season Part.1&quot;. This included the first season episode &quot;The Naked Now&quot;, and the set has a total runtime of 638 minutes across multiple 12-inch optical video discs.
