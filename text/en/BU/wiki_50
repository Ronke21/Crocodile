<text>Mirabilis is a genus of plants in the family Nyctaginaceae known as the four-o&#x27;clocks or umbrellaworts. The best known species may be &quot;Mirabilis jalapa&quot;, the plant most commonly called four o&#x27;clock.

There are several dozen species in the genus, of herbaceous plants, mostly found in the Americas. Some form tuberous roots that enable them to perennate through dry and cool seasons. They have small, often fragrant, deep-throated flowers.

Although best known as ornamental plants, at least one species, &quot;mauka&quot; (&quot;M. expansa&quot;), is grown for food.

<text>Mirabilis was an Israeli company that developed the ICQ instant messaging program, an early example of real-time communication over the Internet.

==History==
Mirabilis was founded in July 1996 by Arik Vardi, Yair Goldfinger, Sefi Vigiser and Amnon Amir.

Goldfinger, Visiger, Vardi and Amir met while working for a Tel Aviv software company, Zapa Digital Arts, that specialized in three-dimensional graphic tools for the Internet. In 1996, they left Zapa and began to toy with ideas for new Internet innovations. They created ICQ in less than two months, but had no funding. Yossi Vardi, the father of Arik Vardi and one of the founders of Israel Chemicals, agreed to invest a few hundred thousand dollars to develop the technology. Mirabilis was established in a small apartment in San Jose, California, where Internet access was cheaper.

ICQ grew as people encouraged their friends to join so they could communicate with each other. This established a powerful network effect as prospective users strongly preferred the system where their friends were likely to be.

It was purchased by America Online (AOL) for $287 million in 1998.

AOL sold ICQ to Digital Sky Technologies for $187.5 million on April 28, 2010.

<text>Pantikapaion ( , from Scythian &#x27;fish-path&#x27;; ) was an ancient Greek city on the eastern shore of Crimea, which the Greeks called Taurica. The city lay on the western side of the Cimmerian Bosporus, and was founded by Milesians in the late 7th or early 6th century BC, on a hill later named Mount Mithridat. Its ruins now lie in the modern city of Kerch.

==Early existence==
During the first centuries of the city&#x27;s existence, imported Greek articles predominated: pottery (see Kerch Style), terracottas, and metal objects, probably from workshops in Rhodes, Corinth, Samos, and Athens. Local production, imitated from the models, was carried on at the same time. Athens manufactured a special type of bowl for the city, known as Kerch ware. Local potters imitated the Hellenistic bowls known as the Gnathia style as well as relief wares—Megarian bowls. The city minted silver coins from the 5th century BC and gold and bronze coins from the 4th century BC. At its greatest extent it occupied . The Hermitage and Kerch Museums contain material from the site, which is still being excavated.

==Fifth to first centuries BC==
In the 5th–4th centuries BC, the city became the residence first of the Archaeanactids and then of the Spartocids, dynasties of Thracian kings of Bosporus, and was hence itself sometimes called Bosporus. Its economic decline in the 4th–3rd centuries BC was the result of the Sarmatian conquest of the steppes and the growing competition of Egyptian grain.

===Mithridates===
The last of the Spartocids, Paerisades V, apparently left his realm to Mithridates VI Eupator, king of Pontus. This transition was arranged by one of Mithridates&#x27;s generals, Diophantus, who earlier had been sent to Taurica to help local Greek cities against Palacus of the Scythian kingdom in Crimea. The mission did not go smoothly: Paerisades was murdered by Scythians led by Saumacus, and Diophantus escaped to return later with reinforcements to suppress the revolt (c. 110 BC).

Half of a century later, Mithridates took his life in Pantikapaion, when, after his defeat in a war against Rome, his son and heir Pharnaces and citizens of Pantikapaion turned against him.

<doc id="598325" wikidata="Q57737" url="?curid=598325" title="Houston Stewart Chamberlain">
<text>Houston Stewart Chamberlain (; 9 September 1855 – 9 January 1927) was a British-German-French philosopher who wrote works about political philosophy and natural science. His writing promoted German ethnonationalism, antisemitism, scientific racism, and Nordicism; he has been described as a &quot;racialist writer&quot;. His best-known book, the two-volume &quot;Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts&quot; (&quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot;), published 1899, became highly influential in the pan-Germanic &quot;Völkisch&quot; movements of the early 20th century, and later influenced the antisemitism of Nazi racial policy. Indeed, Chamberlain has been referred to as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s John the Baptist&quot;.

Born in Hampshire, Chamberlain emigrated to Dresden in adulthood out of an adoration for composer Richard Wagner, and was later naturalised as a German citizen. In 1884, he settled in Paris, and was later naturalised as a French citizen. He married Eva von Bülow, Wagner&#x27;s daughter, in December 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner&#x27;s death.

==Early life and education==
Houston Stewart Chamberlain was born in Southsea, Hampshire, England, the son of Rear Admiral William Charles Chamberlain. His mother, Eliza Jane, daughter of Captain Basil Hall, died before he was a year old, leading to his being brought up by his grandmother in France. His elder brother was professor Basil Hall Chamberlain. Chamberlain&#x27;s poor health frequently led him to being sent to the warmer climates of Spain and Italy for the winter. This constant moving about made it hard for Chamberlain to form lasting friendships.

===Cheltenham College===
Chamberlain&#x27;s education began at a &quot;lycée&quot; in Versailles and continued mostly in continental Europe, but his father had planned a military career for his son. At the age of eleven he was sent to Cheltenham College, an English boarding school that produced many Army and Navy officers. Chamberlain deeply disliked Cheltenham College, and felt lonely and out of place there. The young Chamberlain was &quot;a compulsive dreamer&quot;, more interested in the arts than in the military, and he developed a fondness for nature and a near-mystical sense of self.

Chamberlain grew up in a self-confident, optimistic, Victorian atmosphere that celebrated the nineteenth century as the &quot;Age of Progress&quot;, a world that many Victorians expected to get progressively better with Britain leading the way for the rest of the world. He was supportive of the Liberal Party, and shared the general values of 19th-century British liberalism such as a faith in progress, of a world that could only get better, of the greatness of Britain as a liberal democratic and capitalist society.
Chamberlain&#x27;s major interests in his studies at Cheltenham were the natural sciences, especially astronomy. Chamberlain later recalled: &quot;The stars seemed closer to me, more gentle, more worthy of trust, and more sympathetic – for that is the only word which describes my feelings – than any of the people around me in school. For the stars, I experienced true &quot;friendship&quot;&quot;.

===Embracing conservativism===
During his youth, Chamberlain – while not entirely rejecting at this point his liberalism – became influenced by the romantic conservative critique of the Industrial Revolution. Bemoaning the loss of &quot;Merry Old England&quot;, this view argued for a return to a highly romanticized period of English history, with the people living happily in harmony with nature on the land overseen by a benevolent, cultured elite. In this critique, the Industrial Revolution was seen as a disaster which forced people to live in dirty, overcrowded cities, doing dehumanizing work in factories while society was dominated by a philistine, greedy middle class.

The prospect of serving as an officer in India or elsewhere in the British Empire held no attraction for him. In addition, he was a delicate child with poor health. At the age of fourteen he had to be withdrawn from school. After Cheltenham, Chamberlain always felt out of place in Britain, a society whose values Chamberlain felt were not his values, writing in 1876: &quot;The fact may be regrettable but it remains a fact; I have become so completely un-English that the mere thought of England and the English makes me unhappy&quot;. Chamberlain travelled to various spas around Europe, accompanied by a Prussian tutor, Mr Otto Kuntze, who taught him German and interested him in German culture and history. Fascinated by Renaissance art and architecture, Chamberlain learned Italian and planned to settle in Florence for a time.

===University of Geneva and racial theory===
Chamberlain attended the University of Geneva, in French-speaking Switzerland. There he studied under Carl Vogt, who was a supporter of racial typology, as well as under chemist Carl Gräbe, botanist Johannes Müller Argoviensis, physicist and parapsychologist Marc Thury, astronomer Emile Plantamour, and other professors. Chamberlain&#x27;s main interests as a student revolved around systematic botany, geology, astronomy, and later the anatomy and physiology of the human body. In 1881, he earned a baccalaureate in physical and natural sciences.
During his time in Geneva, Chamberlain, who always despised Benjamin Disraeli, came to hate his country more and more, accusing the Prime Minister of taking British life down to what Chamberlain considered to be his extremely low level. During the early 1880s, Chamberlain was still a Liberal, &quot;a man who approached issues from a firmly Gladstonian perspective and showed a marked antipathy to the philosophy and policies of British Conservatism&quot;. Chamberlain often expressed his disgust with Disraeli, &quot;the man whom he blamed in large measure for the injection of selfish class interest and jingoism into British public life in the next decades&quot;.

An early sign of his anti-Semitism came in 1881 when he described the landlords in Ireland affected by the Land Bill as &quot;blood-sucking Jews&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;). The main landowning classes in Ireland then were gentiles. At this stage of his life his anti-Semitic remarks were few and far between.
====Botany dissertation: theory of vital force====

In Geneva, Chamberlain continued working towards a doctorate in botany, but he later abandoned that project due to ill health. The text of what would have been Chamberlain&#x27;s doctoral dissertation was published in 1897 as &quot;Recherches sur la sève ascendante&quot; (&quot;Studies on rising sap&quot;), but this publication did not culminate in any further academic qualifications.

Chamberlain&#x27;s book was based on his own experimental observations of water transport in various vascular plants. Against the conclusions of Eduard Strasburger, Julius von Sachs, and other leading botanists, he argued that his observations could not be explained by the application of the fluid mechanical theories of the day to the motion of water in the plants&#x27; xylem conduits. Instead, he claimed that his results evidenced other processes, associated with the action of living matter and which he placed under the heading of a &quot;force vitale&quot; (&quot;vital force&quot;).

Chamberlain summarised his thesis in the book&#x27;s introduction:
In response to Strasburger&#x27;s complaint that a vitalistic explanation of the ascent of sap &quot;sidesteps the difficulties, calms our concerns, and thus manages to seduce us&quot;, Chamberlain retorted that &quot;life is not an explanation, nor a theory, but a fact&quot;. Although most plant physiologists currently regard the ascent of sap as adequately explained by the passive mechanisms of transpirational pull and root pressure, some scientists have continued to argue that some form of active pumping is involved in the transport of water within some living plants, though usually without referring to Chamberlain&#x27;s work.

====Support of World Ice Theory====
Chamberlain was an early supporter of Hanns Hörbiger&#x27;s &quot;Welteislehre&quot; (&quot;World Ice Theory&quot;), the theory that most bodies in the Solar System are covered with ice. Due in part to Chamberlain&#x27;s advocacy, this became official dogma during the Third Reich.

====Anti-scientific claims====
Chamberlain&#x27;s attitude towards the natural sciences was somewhat ambivalent and contradictory – he later wrote: &quot;one of the most fatal errors of our time is that which impels us to give too great weight to the so-called &#x27;results&#x27; of science.&quot; Still, his scientific credentials were often cited by admirers to give weight to his political philosophy. Chamberlain rejected Darwinism, evolution and social Darwinism and instead emphasized &quot;Gestalt&quot; which he said derived from Goethe.

==Wagnerite==

An ardent Francophile in his youth, Chamberlain had a marked preference for speaking French over English. It was only at the age of twenty three in November 1878, when he first heard the music of Richard Wagner, that Chamberlain became not only a Wagnerite, but an ardent Germanophile and Francophobe. As he put later, it was then he realized the full &quot;degeneracy&quot; of the French culture that he had so admired compared to the greatness of the German culture that had produced Wagner, whom Chamberlain viewed as one of the great geniuses of all time. In the music of Wagner, Chamberlain found the mystical, life-affirming spiritual force that he had sought unsuccessfully in British and French cultures. Further increasing his love of Germany was that he had fallen in love with a German woman named Anna Horst. As Chamberlain&#x27;s wealthy, elitist family back in Britain objected to him marrying the lower middle-class Horst, this further estranged him from Britain, a place whose people Chamberlain regarded as cold, unfeeling, callous and concerned only with money. By contrast, Chamberlain regarded Germany as the romantic &quot;land of love&quot;, a place whose people had human feelings like love, and whose culture was infused with a special spirituality that brought out the best in humanity. 

In 1883–1884, Chamberlain lived in Paris and worked as a stockbroker. Chamberlain&#x27;s attempts to play the Paris bourse ended in failure as he proved to be inept at business, and much of his hatred of capitalism stemmed from his time in Paris. More happily for him, Chamberlain founded the first Wagner society in Paris and often contributed articles to the &quot;Revue wagnérienne&quot;, the first journal in France devoted to Wagner studies. Together with his friend, the French writer Édouard Dujardin, Chamberlain did much to introduce Wagner to the French, who until then had largely ignored Wagner&#x27;s music.
Thereafter he settled in Dresden, where &quot;he plunged heart and soul into the mysterious depths of Wagnerian music and philosophy, the metaphysical works of the Master probably exercising as strong an influence upon him as the musical dramas&quot;. Chamberlain immersed himself in philosophical writings, and became a &quot;Völkisch&quot; author, one of those concerned more with a highly racist understanding of art, culture, civilisation and spirit than with quantitative physical distinctions between groups. This is evidenced by his huge treatise on Immanuel Kant with its comparisons. It was during his time in Dresden that Chamberlain came to embrace &quot;völkisch&quot; thought through his study of Wagner, and from 1884 onwards, anti-Semitic and racist statements became the norm in his letters to his family. In 1888, Chamberlain wrote to his family proclaiming his joy at the death of the Emperor Friedrich III, a strong opponent of anti-Semitism whom Chamberlain called a &quot;Jewish liberal&quot;, and rejoicing that his anti-Semitic son Wilhelm II was now on the throne. 1888 also saw Chamberlain&#x27;s first visit to the Wahnfried to meet Cosima Wagner, the reclusive leader of the Wagner cult. Chamberlain later recalled that Cosima Wagner had &quot;electrified&quot; him as he felt the &quot;deepest love&quot; for Wagner&#x27;s widow while Wagner wrote to a friend that she felt a &quot;great friendship&quot; with Chamberlain &quot;because of his outstanding learning and dignified character&quot;. Wagner came to regard Chamberlain as her surrogate son. Under her influence, Chamberlain abandoned his previous belief that art was a separate entity from other fields and came to embrace the &quot;völkisch&quot; belief of the unity of race, art, nation and politics.

Chamberlain&#x27;s status as an immigrant to Germany always meant he was to a certain extent an outsider in his adopted country – a man who spoke fluent German, but always with an English accent. Chamberlain tried very hard to be more German than the Germans, and it was his efforts to fit in that led him to &quot;völkisch&quot; politics. Likewise, his anti-Semitism allowed him to define himself as a German in opposition to a group that allegedly threatened all Germans, thereby allowing him to integrate better into the Wagnerian circles with whom he socialized most of the time. Chamberlain&#x27;s friend Hermann Keyserling later recalled that Chamberlain was an eccentric English &quot;individualist&quot; who &quot;never saw Germany as it really is&quot;, instead having an idealized, almost mythic view. This was especially the case as initially the German Wagnerites had rejected Chamberlain, telling him that only Germans could really understand Wagner, statements that very much hurt Chamberlain.

By this time Chamberlain had met Anna Horst, whom he would divorce in 1905 after 28 years of marriage. Chamberlain was an admirer of Richard Wagner, and wrote several commentaries on his works including &quot;Notes sur Lohengrin &quot; (&quot;Notes on Lohengrin&quot;) (1892), an analysis of Wagner&#x27;s drama (1892), and a biography (1895), emphasising in particular the heroic Teutonic aspects in the composer&#x27;s works. Stewart Spencer, writing in &quot;Wagner Remembered&quot;, described Chamberlain&#x27;s edition of Wagner letters as &quot;one of the most egregious attempts in the history of musicology to misrepresent an artist by systematically censoring his correspondence&quot;. In particular, Wagner&#x27;s lively sex life presented a problem for Chamberlain. Wagner had abandoned his first wife Minna, had an open affair with the married woman Mathilde Wesendonck and had started sleeping with his second wife Cosima while she was still married to her first husband. Chamberlain in his Wagner biography went to considerable lengths to distort these details.

During his time in Dresden, Chamberlain like many other &quot;völkisch&quot; activists became fascinated with Hindu mythology, and learned Sanskrit to read the ancient Indian epics like the &quot;Vedas&quot; and the &quot;Upanishads&quot; in their original form. In these stories about ancient Aryan heroes conquering the Indian subcontinent, Chamberlain found a very appealing world governed by a rigid caste system with social inferiors firmly locked into their place; full of larger-than-life Aryan gods and aristocratic heroes and a world that focused on the spiritual at the expense of the material. Since by this time, historians, archaeologists and linguists had all accepted that the Aryans (&quot;noble ones&quot;) of Hindu legend were an Indo-European people, Chamberlain had little trouble arguing that these Aryans were in fact Germanic peoples, and modern Germans had much to learn from Hinduism. For Chamberlain the Hindu texts offered a body of pure Aryan thought that made it possible to find the harmony of humanity and nature, which provided the unity of thought, purpose and action that provided the necessary spirituality for Aryan peoples to find true happiness in a world being destroyed by a soulless materialism.

==Champion of Wagnerism==
In 1889, he moved to Austria. During this time it is said his ideas on race began taking shape, influenced by the concept of Teutonic supremacy he believed embodied in the works of Wagner and the French racist writer Arthur de Gobineau. In his book &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;inégalité des races humaines&quot;, the aristocratic Gobineau, who had an obsessive hatred of commoners, had developed the theory of an Aryan master race. Wagner was greatly influenced by Gobineau&#x27;s theories, but could not accept Gobineau&#x27;s theory of inevitable racial decay amongst what was left of the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, instead preferring the idea of racial regeneration of the Aryans. The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedländer opined that Wagner was the inventor of a new type of anti-Semitism, namely &quot;redemptive anti-semitism&quot;.

In 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner&#x27;s death, Chamberlain married Eva von Bülow-Wagner, Franz Liszt&#x27;s granddaughter and Richard Wagner&#x27;s daughter (Wagner had started fathering children by Cosima while she was still married to Hans von Bülow – despite her surname, Eva was actually Wagner&#x27;s daughter). The next year he moved to Germany and became an important member of the &quot;Bayreuth Circle&quot; of German nationalist intellectuals. As an ardent Wagnerite, Chamberlain saw it as his life&#x27;s mission to spread the message of racial hatred which he believed Wagner had advocated. Chamberlain explained his work in promoting the Wagner cult as an effort to cure modern society of its spiritual ills that he claimed were caused by capitalism, industrialisation, materialism, and urbanisation. Chamberlain wrote about modern society in the 1890s:
Like a wheel that spins faster and faster, the increasing rush of life drives us continually further apart from each other, continually further from the &#x27;firm ground of nature&#x27;; soon it must fling us out into empty nothingness.

In another letter, Chamberlain stated:

If we do not soon pay attention to Schiller&#x27;s thought regarding the transformation from the state of Need into the Aesthetic State, then our condition will degenerate into a boundless chaos of empty talk and arms foundries. If we do not soon heed Wagner&#x27;s warning—that mankind must awaken to a consciousness of its &quot;pristine holy worth&quot;—then the Babylonian tower of senseless doctrines will collapse on us and suffocate the moral core of our being forever.

In Chamberlain&#x27;s view, the purpose of the Wagner cult was nothing less than the salvation of humanity. As such, Chamberlain became engulfed in the &quot;redemptive anti-semitism&quot; that was at the core of both Wagner&#x27;s worldview and of the Wagner cult.

==Vienna years==
In September 1891, Chamberlain visited Bosnia and Herzegovina. Chamberlain had been commissioned by the Austrian government to write propaganda glorying its colonial rule of Bosnia-Herzegovina for a Geneva newspaper. Chamberlain&#x27;s articles about Bosnia reveal his increasing preference for dictatorship over democracy, with Chamberlain praising the Austrians for their utterly undemocratic rule. Chamberlain wrote that what he had seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina was the perfect example of Wagner&#x27;s dictum: &quot;Absolute monarch – free people!&quot; Chamberlain declared that the Bosnians were extremely lucky not to have the shambles and chaos of a democratic &quot;parliamentary regime&quot;, instead being ruled by an idealist, enlightened dictatorship that did what was best for them. Equally important in Chamberlain&#x27;s Bosnian articles was his celebration of &quot;natural man&quot; who lived on the land as a small farmer as opposed to what Chamberlain saw as the corrupt men who lived in modern industrial, urban society. At the time Chamberlain visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, the provinces had been barely touched by modernization, and for the most part, Bosnians continued to live much as their ancestors had done in the Middle Ages. Chamberlain was enchanted with what he saw, and forgetting for the moment that the purpose of his visit was to glorify Austrian rule, expressed much sadness in his articles that the &quot;westernization&quot; being fostered by the Austrians would destroy the traditional way of life in Bosnia. Chamberlain wrote:

[The Bosnian peasant] builds his house, he makes his shoes, and plough, etc.; the woman weaves and dyes the stuffs and cooks the food. When we have civilized these good people, when we have taken from them their beautiful costumes to be preserved in museums as objects of curiosity, when we have ruined their national industries that are so perfect and so primitive, when contact with us has destroyed the simplicity of their manner—then Bosnia will no longer be interesting to us.

Chamberlain&#x27;s awe and pride in the tremendous scientific and technological advances of the 19th century were always tempered with an extremely strong nostalgia for what he saw as the simpler, better and more innocent time when people lived on the land in harmony with nature. In his heart, Chamberlain was always a romantic conservative who idealised the Middle Ages and was never quite comfortable with the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution. In Bosnia, Chamberlain saw an essentially medieval society that still moved to the ancient rhythm of life that epitomized his pastoral ideal. Remembering Bosnia several years later, Chamberlain wrote:

The spirit of a natural man, who does everything and must create everything for himself in life, is decidedly more universal and more harmoniously developed than the spirit of an industrial worker whose whole life is occupied with the manufacturing of a single object ... and that only with the aid of a complicated machine, whose functioning is quite foreign to him. A similar degeneration is taking place amongst peasants: an American farmer in the Far West is today only a kind of subordinate engine driver. Also among us in Europe it becomes every day more impossible for a peasant to exist, for agriculture must be carried out in &quot;large units&quot;—the peasant consequently becomes increasingly like an industrial worker. His understanding dries up; there is no longer an interaction between his spirit and surrounding Nature.

Chamberlain&#x27;s nostalgia for a pre-industrial way of life that he expressed so strongly in his Bosnia articles earned him ridicule, as many believed that he had an absurdly idealized and romanticized view of the rural life that he never experienced first-hand.

In 1893, Chamberlain received a letter from Cosima Wagner telling him that he had to read Gobineau&#x27;s &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;inégalité des races humaines&quot;. Chamberlain accepted Gobineau&#x27;s belief in an Aryan master-race, but rejected his pessimism, writing that Gobineau&#x27;s philosophy was &quot;the grave of every attempt to deal practically with the race question and left only one honorable solution, that we at once put a bullet through our heads&quot;. Chamberlain&#x27;s time in Vienna shaped his anti-Semitism and Pan-Germanism. Despite living in Vienna from 1889 to 1909, when he moved to Bayreuth, Chamberlain had nothing but contempt for the multi-ethnic, multi-religious Habsburg empire, taking the viewpoint that the best thing that could happen to the Austrian empire would be for it to be annexed by Germany to end the (chaos of the peoples). Vienna had a large Jewish population, and Chamberlain&#x27;s time in Vienna may have been the first time in his life when he actually encountered Jews. Chamberlain&#x27;s letters from Vienna constantly complain about how he was having to deal with Jews, every one of whom he detested. In 1894 after visiting a spa, Chamberlain wrote: &quot;Unfortunately like everything else ... it has fallen into the hands of the Jews, which includes two consequences: every individual is bled to the utmost and systematically, and there is neither order nor cleanliness.&quot; In 1895, he wrote:

 However, we shall have to move soon anyway, for our house having been sold to a Jew ... it will soon be impossible for decent people to live in it ... Already the house being almost quite full of Jews, we have to live in a state of continual warfare with the vermin which is a constant and invariable follower of this chosen people even in the most well-to-do classes.

In another letter of 1895, Chamberlain wrote he was still influenced by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&#x27;s critique of the Jews as mindlessly materialistic, writing that Proudhon was &quot;one of the most acute minds of the century&quot; and &quot;I find many points of contact between the Wagner-Schiller mode of thought and the anarchism of Proudhon.&quot; At the same time, Chamberlain&#x27;s marriage to Anna began to fall apart, as his wife was frequently sick and though she assisted her husband with his writings, he did not find her very intellectually stimulating. Chamberlain started to complain more and more that his wife&#x27;s frequent illnesses forced him to tend to her and were holding back his career.

Though Chamberlain consistently remained supportive of German imperialism, he frequently expressed hostile views towards the British Empire; Chamberlain viewed Britain as world&#x27;s most frequent aggressor, a view he expressed more vehemently at the tail end of the 19th century. In 1895, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt about the Hamidian massacres in the Ottoman Empire during 1894–96:

The Armenian insurrection [of 1894] with the inevitable retaliation of massacres and persecution (of course &quot;enormously exaggerated&quot; by those greatest liars in creation, backed by their worthy friends the English journalists) was all got up at the precise moment when English politics required a &quot;diversion&quot;.

In 1896, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt:

The English press is the most insufferably arrogant, generally ignorant, the most passionately one-sided and narrow-minded in its judgments that I know; it is the universal &quot;bully&quot;, always laying down the law for everybody, always speaking as if it were umpire of the universe, always abusing everybody all round and putting party spirit in all its judgments, envenoming thus the most peaceful discussions. It is this and this only which has made England hated all the world over. During the whole year 1895, I never opened an English newspaper without finding &quot;War&quot; predicated or threatened—No other nation in the world has wanted war or done anything but pray for peace—England alone, the world&#x27;s bully, has been stirring it up on all sides.

During the 1890s, Chamberlain was an outspoken critic of British policies in South Africa, writing to his uncle in 1898:

At the time of the Second Boer War, Chamberlain privately expressed support for the cause of the Boers, although he also expressed regret over &quot;white men&quot; fighting each other at a time when Chamberlain believed that white supremacy around the world was being threatened by the alleged &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;. In July 1900, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt:

One thing I can clearly see, that is, that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men and threatens destruction ... The fact that a tiny nation of peasants absolutely untrained in the conduct of war, has been able to keep the whole united empire at bay for months, and has only been overcome—and &quot;has&quot; it been overcome?—by sending out an army superior in number to the whole population including women and children, has lowered respect for England beyond anything you can imagine on your side of the water, and will certainly not remain lost on the minds of those countless millions who have hitherto been subdued by our prestige only.

Chamberlain seized upon the fact that some of the Randlords were Jewish to argue in his letters to Cosima Wagner that the war was a case of Anglo-Jewish aggression against the Germanic Afrikaners.

As a leading Wagnerite in Vienna, Chamberlain befriended a number of other prominent Wagnerites, such as Prince Hohenhohe-Langenburg, Ludwig Schemann, Georg Meurer, and Baron Christian von Ehrenfels. The most important friendship that Chamberlain made during his time in Vienna was with German Ambassador to Austria-Hungary, Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, who shared Chamberlain&#x27;s love of Wagnerian music. Eulenburg was also an anti-Semite, an Anglophobe and a convinced enemy of democracy who found much to admire in Chamberlain&#x27;s anti-Semitic, anti-British and anti-democratic writings.

==&quot;Die Grundlagen&quot; (&quot;The Foundations&quot;)==

In February 1896, the Munich publisher Hugo Bruckmann, a leading &quot;völkisch&quot; activist who was later to publish &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, commissioned Chamberlain to write a book summarizing the achievements of the 19th century.

In October 1899, Chamberlain published his most famous work, &quot;Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts&quot;, in German. &quot;The Foundations&quot; is a pseudo-scientific &quot;racial history&quot; of humanity from the emergence of the first civilizations in the ancient Near East to the year 1800. It argues that all of the &quot;foundations&quot; of the 19th century, which saw huge economic, scientific and technological advances in the West, were the work of the &quot;Aryan race&quot;. &quot;Die Grundlagen&quot; was only the first volume of an intended three-volume history of the West, with the second and third volumes taking up the story of the West in the 19th century and the looming war for world domination in the coming 20th century between the Aryans on one side vs. the Jews, blacks and Asians on the other side.

Chamberlain never wrote the third volume, much to the intense annoyance of Cosima Wagner, who was upset that &quot;Die Grundlagen&quot; stopped in 1800 before Wagner was born, and thus omitted her husband. The book argued that Western civilisation is deeply marked by the influence of Teutonic peoples.

===Peoples defined as Aryans===
Chamberlain grouped all European peoples – not just Germans, but Celts, Slavs, Greeks, and Latins – into the &quot;Aryan race&quot;, a race built on the ancient Proto-Indo-European culture. In fact, he even included the Berber people of North Africa.

At the helm of the Aryan race, and, indeed, all races, according to Chamberlain, were the Germanic or Teutonic peoples, who had best preserved the Aryan blood. Chamberlain used the terms Aryan, Indo-European and Indo-Germanic interchangeably, but he emphasised that purest Aryans were to be found in Central Europe and that in both France and Russia miscegenation had diluted the Aryan blood. Much of Chamberlain&#x27;s theory about the superiority of the Aryan race was taken from the writings of Gobineau, but there was a crucial difference in that Gobineau had used the Aryan race theory as a way of dividing society between an Aryan nobility vs. racially inferior commoners whereas Chamberlain used the Aryan racial theory as a way of uniting society around its supposed common racial origins.

===Aryan race virtues===
Everything that Chamberlain viewed as good in the world was ascribed to the Aryans. For an example, in &quot;The Foundations&quot;, Chamberlain explained at considerable length that Jesus Christ could not possibly be a Jew, and very strongly implied that Christ was an Aryan.

Chamberlain&#x27;s tendency to see everything good as the work of the Aryans allowed him to claim whoever he approved of for the Aryan race, which at least was part of the appeal of the book in Germany when it was published in 1899. Chamberlain claimed all of the glories and achievements of ancient Greece and Rome as due entirely to Aryan blood. Chamberlain wrote that ancient Greece was a &quot;lost ideal&quot; of beautiful thought and art that the modern Germans were best placed to recover if only the German people could embrace Wagner.

Chamberlain praised Rome for its militarism, civic values, patriotism, respect for the law and reverence for the family as offering the best sort of Aryan government. Reflecting his opposition to feminism, Chamberlain lamented how modern women were not like the submissive women of ancient Rome whom he claimed were most happy in obeying the wills of their husbands. Chamberlain asserted that Aryans and Aryans alone are the only people in the entire world capable of creating beautiful art and thinking great thoughts, so he claimed all of the great artists, writers and thinkers of the West as part of one long glorious tradition of Aryan art and thought, which Chamberlain planned to have culminate with the life-changing, racially regenerating music of Richard Wagner in the 19th century. As the British historian George Peabody Gooch wrote, here was &quot;a glittering vision of mind and muscle, of large scale organization, of intoxicating self-confidence, of metallic brilliancy, such as Europe has never seen&quot;.

The antithesis of the heroic Aryan race with its vital, creative life-improving qualities was the &quot;Jewish race&quot;, whom Chamberlain presented as the inverse of the Aryan. Every positive quality the Aryans had, the Jews had the exact opposing negative quality. The American historian Geoffrey Field wrote:

To each negative &quot;Semitic&quot; trait Chamberlain counter-posed a Teutonic virtue. Kantian moral freedom took the place of political liberty and egalitarianism. Irresponsible Jewish capitalism was sharply distinguished from the vague ideal of Teutonic industrialism, a romantic vision of an advanced technological society which had somehow managed to retain the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot;, cooperation and hierarchy of the medieval guilds. The alternative to Marxism was &quot;ethical socialism&quot;, such as that described by Thomas More, &quot;one of the most exquisite scholars ever produced by a Teutonic people, of an absolutely aristocratic, refined nature&quot;. In the rigidly elitist, disciplined society of &quot;Utopia&quot; with its strong aura of Christian humanism, Chamberlain found an approximation of his own nostalgic, communal ideal. &quot;The gulf separating More from Marx,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is not the progress of time, but the contrast between Teuton and Jew.&quot;

===Jewish wars claim===
Chamberlain announced in &quot;The Foundations&quot; that &quot;all the wars&quot; in history were &quot;so peculiarly connected with Jewish financial operations&quot;. Chamberlain warned that the aim of the Jew was &quot;to put his foot upon the neck of all nations of the world and be Lord and possessor of the whole earth&quot;.

As part of their plans to destroy Aryan civilization, Chamberlain wrote: &quot;Consider, with what mastery they use the law of blood to extend their power.&quot; Chamberlain wrote that Jewish women were encouraged to marry Gentiles while Jewish men were not, so the male line &quot;remained spotless ... thousands of side-branches are cut off and employed to infect Indo-Europeans with Jewish blood.&quot; In his account of the Punic wars between &quot;Aryan Rome&quot; and &quot;Semitic Carthage&quot;, Chamberlain praised the Romans for their total destruction of Carthage in 146 BC at the end of the Third Punic War as an example of how Aryans should deal with Semites. Later, Chamberlain argued that the Romans had become too tolerant of Semites like the Jews, and this was the cause of the downfall of the Roman empire. As such, the destruction of the Western Roman Empire by the Germanic peoples was merely an act of liberation from the (&quot;Chaos of the Peoples&quot;) that the Roman empire had become.

===Theories of Jewish conspiracy===
The ultimate aim of the Jew, according to Chamberlain, was to create a situation where &quot;there would be in Europe only a single people of pure race, the Jews, all the rest would be a herd of pseudo-Hebraic mestizos, a people beyond all doubt degenerate physically, mentally and morally.&quot;

As part of their plans to destroy the Aryans, Chamberlain claimed that the Jews had founded the Roman Catholic Church, which only preached a &quot;Judaized&quot; Christianity that had nothing to do with the Christianity created by the Aryan Christ. Some historians have argued that &quot;The Foundations&quot; are actually more anti-Catholic than anti-Semitic, but this misses the point that the reason why Chamberlain attacked the Catholic Church so fiercely was because he believed the Papacy was controlled by the Jews. Chamberlain claimed that in the 16th century the Aryan Germans under the leadership of Martin Luther had broken away from the corrupt influence of Rome, and so laid the foundations of a &quot;Germanic Christianity&quot;.

Chamberlain claimed that the natural and best form of government for Aryans was a dictatorship, and so he blamed the Jews for inventing democracy as part of their plans for destroying the Aryans. In the same way, Chamberlain blamed capitalism – which he saw as a very destructive economic system – as something invented by the Jews to enrich themselves at the expense of the Aryans while at the same time crediting the Jews with inventing socialism with its message of universal human equality as a cunning Jewish stratagem to divert attention away from all the economic devastation wrought by Jewish financiers.

Chamberlain had a deep dislike of the Chinese, and in &quot;The Foundations&quot; he announced that Chinese civilization had been founded by the Jews.

===Jewish race – not religion===
The Franco-Israeli historian Saul Friedländer described &quot;The Foundations&quot; – with its theory of two &quot;pure&quot; races left in the world, namely the German and Jewish locked into a war for world domination which could only end with the complete victory of one over the other – as one of the key texts of &quot;redemptive anti-semitism&quot;. Because Chamberlain viewed Jews as a race, not a religion, Chamberlain argued the conversion of Jews was not a &quot;solution&quot; to the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;, stating Jewish converts to Christianity were still Jews. Dutch journalist Ian Buruma wrote:

Wagner himself, like Luther, still believed that a Jew could, as he put it with his customary charm, &quot;annihilate&quot; his Jewishness by repudiating his ancestry, converting and worshiping at the shrine of Bayreuth. So in theory a Jew could be a German ... But to the mystical chauvinists, like Chamberlain, who took a tribal view of Germanness, even radical, Wagnerian assimilation could never be enough: the Jew was an alien virus to be purged from the national bloodstream. The more a Jew took on the habits and thoughts of his gentile compatriots, the more he was to be feared.

===Leaving &quot;the solution&quot; to the reader===
Chamberlain did not advocate the extermination of Jews in &quot;The Foundations&quot;; indeed, despite his determination to blame all of the world&#x27;s problems on the Jews, Chamberlain never proposed a solution to this perceived problem. Instead, Chamberlain made the cryptic statement that after reading his book, his readers would know best about how to devise a &quot;solution&quot; to the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;.

Friedländer has argued that if one were to seriously take up the theories of &quot;redemptive anti-semitism&quot; proposed in &quot;The Foundations&quot;, and push them to their logical conclusion, then inevitably one would reach the conclusion that genocide might be a perfectly acceptable &quot;solution&quot; to the &quot;Jewish Question&quot;. Friedländer argued that there is an implied genocidal logic to &quot;The Foundations&quot; as Chamberlain argued that Jews were a race apart from the rest of humanity; that evil was embedded within the genes of the Jews, and so the Jews were born evil and remained evil until they died.

===&quot;The Foundations&quot; sales, reviews and acceptance===
&quot;The Foundations&quot; sold well: eight editions and 60,000 copies within 10 years, 100,000 copies by the outbreak of World War I and 24 editions and more than a quarter of a million copies by 1938.

The success of &quot;The Foundations&quot; after it was published in October 1899 made Chamberlain into a celebrity intellectual. The popularity of &quot;The Foundations&quot; was such that many &quot;Gymnasium&quot; (high school) teachers in the Protestant parts of Germany made&quot; Die Grundlagen&quot; required reading.

Conservative and National Liberal newspapers gave generally friendly reviews to &quot;The Foundations&quot;. newspapers gave overwhelming positive reviews to &quot;The Foundations&quot;, with many reviewers calling it one of the greatest books ever written. Liberal and Social Democratic newspapers gave the book extremely poor reviews with reviewers complaining of an irrational way of reasoning in &quot;The Foundations&quot;, noting that Chamberlain quoted the writings of Goethe out of context in order to give him views that he had not held, and that the entire book was full of an obsessive anti-Semitism which they found extremely off-putting. Because of Chamberlain&#x27;s anti-Catholicism, Catholic newspapers all published very hostile reviews of &quot;The Foundations&quot;, though Catholic reviewers rarely faulted &quot;Die Grundlagen&quot; for its anti-Semitism. More orthodox Protestant newspapers were disturbed by Chamberlain&#x27;s call for a racialized Christianity.
German Jewish groups like the &quot;Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens&quot; and the &quot;Verein zur Abwehr des Antisemitismus&quot; repeatedly issued statements in the early 20th century that the popularity of &quot;The Foundations&quot; was a major source of concern for them, noting that &quot;Die Grundlagen&quot; had caused a major increase in anti-Semitism with many German Jews now finding themselves the objects of harassment and sometimes violence.

The German Jewish journalist Moritz Goldstein wrote in 1912 that he had become a Zionist because he believed there was no future for Jews in Germany, and one of the reasons for that belief was: Chamberlain believes what he says and for that very reason his distortions shock me. And thousands more believe as he does for the book goes one edition after another and I would still like to know if many Germanic types, whose self-image is pleasantly indulged by this theory, are able to remain critical enough to question its countless injustices and errors?
===Discrimination of Jews following the book===

German universities were hotbeds of activity in the early 20th century, and &quot;The Foundations&quot; was extremely popular on university campuses, with many university clubs using &quot;The Foundations&quot; as a reason to exclude Jewish students.

Likewise, military schools were centers of &quot;völkisch&quot; thought in the early 20th century, and so &quot;The Foundations&quot; was very popular with officer cadets; though since neither the Navy nor the Prussian, Bavarian, Saxon and Württemberg armies accepted Jewish officer candidates, &quot;Die Grundlagen&quot; did not lead to Jews being excluded.

==Evangelist of race==
===Visit to England and attack on its Jews===
In 1900, for the first time in decades, Chamberlain visited Britain. Writing to Cosima Wagner from London, Chamberlain stated sadly that &quot;his&quot; Britain, the Britain of aristocratic rule, hard work and manly courage, the romanticized &quot;Merry Old England&quot; of his imagination was no more; it had been replaced by what Chamberlain saw as a materialist, soulless society, atomized into individuals with no sense of the collective purpose and dominated by greed. Chamberlain wrote that since the 1880s Britain had &quot;chosen the service of Mammon&quot;, for which he blamed the Jews, writing to Wagner: &quot;This is the result, when one has studied politics with a Jew for a quarter century.&quot; The &quot;Jew&quot; Chamberlain was referring to was Disraeli, whom Chamberlain had always hated. Chamberlain declared in his letter that all British businessmen were now dishonest; the middle class, smug and stupid; small farmers and shops were no longer able to compete with Jewish-owned big business; and the monarchy was &quot;irretrievably weakened&quot; by social change.

===German superiority to rule the world===
In the summer of 1900, Chamberlain wrote an essay in the magazine &quot;Jugend&quot;, where he declared that: &quot;The reign of Wilhelm II has the character of the dawning of a new day.&quot; Chamberlain went on to write that Wilhelm was &quot;in fact the first German Kaiser&quot; who knew his mission was to &quot;ennoble&quot; the world by spreading &quot;German knowledge, German philosophy, German art and—if God wills—German religion. Only a Kaiser who undertakes this task is a true Kaiser of the German people.&quot; To allow Germany to become a world power, Chamberlain called for the &quot;Reich&quot; to become the world&#x27;s greatest sea power, as Chamberlain asserted that whatever power rules the seas also rules the world.

===Kaiser Wilhelm II===
In early 1901, the German Emperor Wilhelm II read &quot;The Foundations&quot; and was immensely impressed. The Imperial Grand Chamberlain at the court, Ulrich von Bülow, wrote in a letter to a friend in January 1901 that the Kaiser was &quot;studying the book a second time page by page&quot;. In November 1901, Chamberlain&#x27;s friend, the German diplomat and courtier Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, who happened to be the best friend of Wilhelm II, introduced Chamberlain to the Kaiser. 

Chamberlain and Wilhelm first met at Eulenburg&#x27;s estate at Liebenberg. To reach Liebenberg from Vienna, Chamberlain had first to take a train to Berlin, and then board another train to Liebenberg. Chamberlain&#x27;s meeting with the Kaiser was considered so important that when Chamberlain reached Berlin, he was met by the Chancellor Prince Bernhard von Bülow, who joined him on the trip to Liebenberg. During the train ride, Bülow and Chamberlain had a long discussion about &quot;The Foundations&quot;. When he met Chamberlain for the first time, Wilhelm told him: &quot;I thank you for what you have done for Germany!&quot; The next day, Eulenburg wrote to a friend that the Emperor &quot;stood completely under the spell of [Chamberlain], whom he understood better than any of the other guests because of his thorough study of &quot;The Foundations&quot;&quot;.
Until Chamberlain&#x27;s death, he and Wilhelm had what the American historian Geoffrey Field called &quot;a warm, personal bond&quot;, which was expressed in a series of &quot;elaborate, wordy letters&quot;. The Wilhelm–Chamberlain letters were full of &quot;the perplexing thought world of mystical and racist conservatism&quot;. They ranged far and wide in subject matter: the ennobling mission of the Germanic race, the corroding forces of Ultramontanism, materialism and the &quot;destructive poison&quot; of were favorite themes. Other subjects often discussed in the Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were the dangers posed to the by the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, &quot;Tartarized Slavdom&quot;, and the &quot;black hordes&quot;. Wilhelm&#x27;s later concept of &quot;Juda-England&quot;, of a decaying Britain sucked dry by Jewish capitalists, owed much to Chamberlain. In 1901, Wilhelm informed Chamberlain in a letter that: &quot;God sent your book to the German people, just as he sent you personally to me, that is my unshakably firm conviction.&quot; Wilhelm went on to praise Chamberlain as his &quot;comrade-in-arms and ally in the struggle for Teutons against Rome, Jerusalem, etc.&quot;

The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma described Chamberlain&#x27;s letters to the Kaiser as pushing his &quot;Anglophobic, anti-Semitic, Germanophile ideas to the point of murderous lunacy&quot;. The liberal &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot; newspaper complained in an editorial of the close friendship between Wilhelm II and such an outspoken racist and anti-Semite as Chamberlain, stating this was a real cause for concern for decent, caring people both inside and outside Germany.

For Wilhelm, all pride about being German had a certain ambivalence, as he was in fact half-British. In an age of ultra-nationalism with identities being increasingly defined in racial terms, his mixed heritage imposed considerable psychological strain on Wilhelm, who managed at one and the same time to be both an Anglophile and Anglophobe; he was a man who both loved and hated the British, and his writings about the land of his mother displayed both extreme admiration and loathing. Buruma observed that for all his much-vaunted beliefs in public about the superiority of everything German, in private Wilhelm often displayed signs of an inferiority complex to the British, as if he really felt deep down that it was Britain, not Germany, that was the world&#x27;s greatest country. For Wilhelm, someone like Chamberlain, the Englishman who came to Germany to praise the Fatherland as the world&#x27;s greatest nation, and who had &quot;scientifically&quot; proven that &quot;fact&quot; in &quot;The Foundations&quot;, was a &quot;dream come true&quot; for him. Writing about the Chamberlain-Wilhelm relationship, Field stated:

Chamberlain helped place Wilhelm&#x27;s tangled and vaguely formulated fears of Pan Slavism, the black and yellow &quot;hordes&quot;, Jews, Ultramontanes, Social Democrats, and free-thinkers to a global and historical framework copiously footnoted and sustained by a vast array of erudite information. He elevated the Emperor&#x27;s dream of a German mission into an elaborate vision of divinely ordained, racial destiny. The lack of precision, the muddle, and logical flaws that are so apparent to modern readers of &quot;The Foundations&quot; did not bother Wilhelm: he eagerly submitted to its subjective, irrational style of reasoning. ... And if the Kaiser was a Prussian with an ingrained respect for English values and habits, Chamberlain was just as much an Englishman who was deeply ambivalent about his own birthplace and who revered German qualities and Prussian society. Almost unconsciously, as his vast correspondence shows, he adopted an obsequious, scraping tone when addressing the lowliest of Prussian army officers. If Wilhelm was drawn to the very Englishness of Chamberlain, the author of &quot;The Foundations&quot; saw in the Hohenzollern prince—at least until the World War—the very symbol of his idealized .

Chamberlain frequently wrote to an appreciative and admiring Wilhelm telling him that it was only the noble &quot;German spirit&quot; which was saving the world from being destroyed by a &quot;deracinated Yankee-Anglo-Jewish materialism&quot;. Finally, Wilhelm was also a Wagnerite and found much to admire in Chamberlain&#x27;s writings praising Wagner&#x27;s music as a mystical, spiritual life-force that embodied all that was great about the &quot;German spirit&quot;.

===&#x27;The Foundations&#x27; book success===
The success of &quot;The Foundations&quot; made Chamberlain famous all over the world. In 1906, the Brazilian intellectual Sílvio Romero cited Chamberlain together with Otto Ammon, Georges Vacher de Lapouge and Arthur de Gobineau as having proved that the blond &quot;dolichocephalic&quot; people of northern Europe were the best and greatest race in the entire world, and urged that Brazil could become a great nation by a huge influx of German immigrants who would achieve the &quot;embranquecimento&quot; (whitening) of Brazil. Chamberlain received invitations to lecture on his racial theories at Yale and Johns Hopkins universities, but turned them down on the grounds that he had no wish to visit what he viewed as a culturally and spiritually debased nation like the United States.

When the book was first published, there was much fevered speculation in the German press as to whether Chamberlain was related to Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary who, as the principal author of the British forward policy in South Africa, was one of the most detested men in the &quot;Reich&quot;. Several German magazines mistakenly printed pictures of Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s sons, Austen Chamberlain and Neville Chamberlain, identifying them as the author of &quot;The Foundations&quot;. Many Germans breathed a sigh of relief when it was established that Houston Stewart Chamberlain was not related to the Chamberlain family of Birmingham.

===Chamberlain circle===
After the success of &quot;The Foundations&quot;, a Chamberlain &quot;Kreis&quot; (circle) appeared in Vienna that comprised the Indologist Leopold von Schroeder, Count Ulrich von Bülow; Countess Melanie Metternich-Zichy, Countess Marietta von Coudenhove, Baroness Emma von Ehrenfels, the music critic and Wagnerite Gustav Schonaich, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Count Hermann Keyserling and Rudolf Kassner who met weekly at Chamberlain&#x27;s home to discuss his racial theories.

===Personal life and financials===
It was during this period that Chamberlain had an affair with Baroness von Ehrenfels, the wife of his friend Baron Christian von Ehrenfels and another affair with a Viennese showgirl, Lili Petri. In 1906, his marriage to Anna ended in divorce.

Besides the income from sales of &quot;The Foundations&quot; and the essays he was constantly writing for newspapers and journals, Chamberlain was supported financially by a wealthy German piano-manufacturer, August Ludowici (who liked Chamberlain so much that he purchased a house for him), and by the Swiss industrialist Agénor Boissier, giving an annual income of about 30,000–40,000 marks (by contrast a German school-teacher had an annual income of 1,000 marks, while a professor made about 12,000 marks per year). In 1908, after Cosima Wagner suggested the match, Chamberlain married Wagner&#x27;s daughter Eva von Bülow.

===Chamberlain&#x27;s character===
Chamberlain saw himself as a prophet, writing to the Kaiser: &quot;Today, God relies only on the Germans. That is the knowledge, the sure truth, which has filled my soul for years; I have sacrificed my peace in serving it; for it I shall live and die.&quot; Eulenburg recalled that under his quiet demeanor Chamberlain had a &quot;fiery spirit with those eyes and looks which speak volumes&quot;. The few who knew Chamberlain well described him as a quiet, reserved man full of urbane erudition and charm; a modest, genial character with elegant manners dressed in expensive suits who could talk brilliantly and with much wit about a great number of subjects for hours. But under his polished surface, Chamberlain had a &quot;fanatical and obsessive&quot; side. His copious notebooks and letters show a man with &quot;a profoundly irrational mind&quot;, a markedly sadistic and deeply paranoid individual who believed himself to be the victim of a monstrous worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy him. Chamberlain&#x27;s status as a semi-recluse came about because of his fear that the Jews were plotting his murder.

===German world dominance by race===
A strong imperialist, Chamberlain was naturally a fervent supporter of &quot;Weltpolitik&quot;, under which Germany sought to become the world&#x27;s dominant power, which he justified on racist grounds. In 1904, when the German government committed the Herero and Namaqua Genocide against the Herero and Namaqua peoples in German South-West Africa, Chamberlain congratulated Wilhelm in a letter for his genocidal policies, praising the Kaiser for his &quot;war of extermination&quot;, which was &quot;a fine example&quot; of how Aryans should deal with &quot;niggers&quot;. In a 1906 letter to Wilhelm, Chamberlain announced that due to miscegenation caused by the Jews, Britain, France, Austria and Russia were all declining powers, and only the &quot;pure&quot; German &quot;Reich&quot; was capable of protecting the &quot;life-giving center of Western Europe&quot; from the &quot;Tartarized Russians, the dreaming weakly mongrels of Oceania and South America, and the millions of blacks, impoverished in intellect and bestially inclined, who even now are arming for the war of the races in which there will be no quarter given&quot;. Thus, Chamberlain wrote to Wilhelm, German &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; was a &quot;sacred mission&quot; to protect the superior races and cultures from the inferior.

===Harden–Eulenburg affair===
In 1908, the Harden–Eulenburg affair badly damaged Wilhelm&#x27;s reputation when Wilhelm&#x27;s and Chamberlain&#x27;s mutual friend Eulenburg was exposed in the press as a homosexual. Since Eulenburg had been the Emperor&#x27;s best friend since 1886, the scandal led to much gossip all over the &quot;Reich&quot; about whether Wilhelm and Eulenburg had been more than just best friends. Chamberlain was never as close to Eulenburg as Wilhelm was, and seemed genuinely shocked to learn of the allegations that Eulenburg was homosexual. During the scandal, practically the entire &quot;völkisch&quot; movement came out in support of Eulenburg whom they portrayed as an Aryan heterosexual framed by false allegations of homosexuality by the Jews Max Bernstein and Magnus Hirschfeld. The German journalist Theodor Wolff wrote in 1906 about Eulenburg&#x27;s role as one of Germany&#x27;s chief anti-Semites:

I bet you ten to one that it was that &quot;skald&quot; [Eulenburg], the friend and admirer of Gobineau, who first pointed his other friend, the Kaiser towards the racial prophet&#x27;s most eager disciple, Houston Stewart Chamberlain. The mystical notion of the &quot;race that will bring order to the world&quot; found its way from Gobineau via Eulenburg and Chamberlain to the Kaiser, and this notion in turn gave rise to the thought that &quot;the world should be healed by the German spirit.&quot;

===Toning down attacks on Catholicism===
As a part of his role as the &quot;Evangelist of Race&quot;, Chamberlain toned down his anti-Catholicism in the first decade of the 20th century, realizing belatedly that his attacks on the Catholic Church in &quot;The Foundations&quot; had alienated the German Catholic community from his message.

===Themes: German unity and German science and philosophy===
As a well-known public intellectual, Chamberlain wrote on numerous subjects in a vast array of newspapers and magazines. Besides attacking the Jews, one of the chief themes of Chamberlain&#x27;s essays was the unity of German culture, language, race and art, and the need for the unity of German art with a racialized &quot;Germanic Christianity&quot;.

The other major theme of Chamberlain&#x27;s work was science and philosophy. Chamberlain was always keenly interested in modern science and saw himself as a scientist, but he was deeply critical of the claim that modern science could explain everything, believing there was a spiritual side to humanity that science could not explain. As such, Chamberlain believed that modern Germany was being destroyed by people losing their spiritual aspects owing to the materialist belief that science could explain all.

In his 1905 biography of one of his heroes, the philosopher Immanuel Kant, Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown the limits of rationalism and reason for understanding the world. Instead, Chamberlain argued that Kant had shown that the instinctive approach based on intuition was a far more valid way of understanding the world. Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;Kantian&quot; way of understanding science was used to attack the Jews, with Chamberlain writing:

Chamberlain&#x27;s 1912 biography of another of his heroes, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, was used to pass on the same message. Chamberlain depicted Goethe as a &quot;Kantian&quot; man who had correctly embraced both the rational, scientific approaches to life and the instinctive, mystical approach to achieve a synthesis that embraced the best of both worlds. Again, Chamberlain used Goethe as a way of attacking the Jews, with Chamberlain claiming that Goethe had favored banning sexual relations between Aryans and Jews and was a man who would not have &quot;suffered among us&quot; the Jewish artists, journalists, and professors of modern Germany.

The German Jewish journal &quot;Im deutschen Reich&quot; wrote in a review of &quot;Goethe&quot; that Chamberlain had appropriated Goethe in &quot;a polemic about race politics, racial hygiene and racial worth from the standpoint of a monomaniacal Judeophobia&quot;.

===Embracing Treitschke===
The policies of &quot;Weltpolitik&quot;, especially the Tirpitz Plan, brought about a period of Anglo-German tension in the first years of the 20th century. Chamberlain, who detested the land of his birth, had no trouble taking sides in the emerging Anglo-German antagonism. Chamberlain, who came to hate Britain, expressed his approval of the writings of the Anglophobic and anti-Semitic German historian Heinrich von Treitschke, whose view of Britain as a grasping, greedy nation of cheap traders dishonestly vacuuming up the world&#x27;s wealth was the same as his own.

===Necessary German power===
Chamberlain declared to Wilhelm that Germany now had to become the world&#x27;s greatest power, both for its own good and for the good of the rest of the world. In his letter, Chamberlain dismissed France as a second-rate nation that could only fall further; Russia was a nation of &quot;stupid&quot; Slavs which was only just being held together because Nicholas II had German blood; without the German blood in the House of Romanov &quot;nothing would remain but a decaying &quot;matière brute&quot;&quot; in Russia; and Britain was clearly declining into a bottomless pit of greed, ineffective democratic politics and unrestrained individualism. Chamberlain called the United States a &quot;Dollar dynasty&quot;, writing:

From dollars only dollars can come, nothing else; spiritually America will live only so long as the stream of European spiritual power flows there, not a moment longer. That part of the world, it may be proven, creates sterility, it has as little of a future as it has a past.

Chamberlain concluded his letter to Wilhelm that: &quot;The future progress of mankind depends on a powerful Germany extending far across the earth.&quot; To this end, Chamberlain advocated German expansionism both in Europe and all over the world; building the High Seas Fleet which would break the British mastery of the seas; and restructuring German society along the lines advocated by the extreme right-wing &quot;völkisch&quot; Pan-German League.

==Propagandist of the World War==

=== Health and paralysis ===
In August 1914, he started suffering from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At the end of the war, Chamberlain&#x27;s paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage.

=== Taking Germany&#x27;s side ===
When World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on account of his age (then 58) and bad health. In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country: No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything humanly possible to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse. ... Germany&#x27;s victory will not be England&#x27;s ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England&#x27;s rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England&#x27;s victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe. The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an &quot;Aryan soldier-king&quot; and as a &quot;Siegfried&quot; who had embraced the &quot;struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry&quot;. Chamberlain went on to call the war &quot;a life-or-death struggle ... between two human ideals: the German and the un-German&quot;. Accordingly, the &quot;Reich&quot; must &quot;for the next hundred years or more&quot; strengthen all things German and carry out &quot;the determined extermination of the un-German&quot;.

Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: &quot;I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations—1870 and 1914—and that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes.&quot; In his 1914 essay, &quot;Whose Fault Is the War?&quot;, Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain. Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war. His vociferous denunciations of his land of birth, it has been posited, were the culmination of his rejection of his native England&#x27;s capitalism, in favour of a form of German Romanticism akin to that which he had cultivated in himself during his years at Cheltenham.

=== Wartime Essays ===
During World War I, Chamberlain published several propaganda texts against his country of birth—&quot;Kriegsaufsätze&quot; (Wartime Essays). In the first four tracts, he maintained that Germany is a nation of peace; England&#x27;s political system is a sham, while Germany exhibits true freedom; German is the greatest and only remaining &quot;living&quot; language; and the world would be better off doing away with English and French-styled parliamentary governments in favour of German rule &quot;thought out by a few and carried out with iron consequence&quot;. The final two discuss England and Germany at length.

Chamberlain&#x27;s basic argument was that democracy was an idiotic system as equality was a myth—humans were very different with different abilities and talents, so democratic equality where the opinions of one voter mattered much as the opinions of the next was a completely flawed idea. Quoting the French scientist Gustave Le Bon, Chamberlain wrote the vast majority of people were simply too stupid to properly understand the issues, and as such Germany with its rule by elites was a much better governed nation than France. In Germany, Chamberlain asserted, true freedom existed, as freedom came from the state alone which made it possible for society to function, not the individual as was the case in Britain and France, which Chamberlain claimed was a recipe for chaos. Field summarized Chamberlain&#x27;s thesis: the essence of German freedom was the willing submission as a matter of conscience to legitimately constituted authorities; it implied duty more than rights and was something spiritual and internal for which each moral being had to strive. Consigning &#x27;liberty&#x27; to an inner, &#x27;nonpolitical&#x27; moral realm, Chamberlain closed off any discussion of the specific conditions for a free society and simply asserted that freedom was perfectly compatible with an authoritarian system of government.

Chamberlain argued that in democratic states, it was always big business that was really in charge; as such democracy was a fraud and democratic governments only served the rich; and democratic states only existed &quot;to further the interests of money making all over the globe&quot;.

=== Attacks on democracy ===
Chamberlain&#x27;s attacks on democracy as a sham designed to allow &quot;Jewish plutocrats&quot; to rule the world were not only very anti-British and anti-French, but also anti-American. From the start of the war, Chamberlain attacked all democratic governments in the world including the neutral United States as a fraud perpetrated by the Jews. Chamberlain wrote that America &quot;is a hellish whirlpool, in which all the contradictions of the world, all the greed, envy and lust brew and simmer; a wild struggle of millions of ignorant egotists, men without ideas, ideals, or traditions, without shared values, without any capacity for sacrifice, an atomic chaos endowed with no true power of nature&quot;. Until the United States entered the war in 1917, the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot; worked hard to prevent Chamberlain&#x27;s essays with their strong anti-American content from appearing abroad out of the fear that they would offend opinion in America. Chamberlain&#x27;s wartime writings also gained much attention – albeit of a highly negative sort – in his native Britain, with &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; declaring: &quot;The most ignorant of the Germans has not written greater nonsense.&quot; In 1915, an unauthorised translation of Chamberlain&#x27;s wartime essays was published in London under the title of &quot;The Ravings of a Renegade&quot;.

=== Germany versus England ===
In his 1915 pamphlet &quot;Deutschland und England&quot; (&quot;Germany and England&quot;), Chamberlain vigorously took the side of his adopted land against the land of his birth. Chamberlain explained the British were once noble Aryans like the Germans who lived in a perfect rigidly hierarchical, romantically rural &quot;unmixed&quot; society, but then starting in the 16th century capitalism had corrupted the English. Capitalism had turned the English into an urban nation dominated by a vulgar money-grubbing, philistine middle class incapable of culture. The beautiful English countryside, which Chamberlain claimed was once the home of an idyllic agrarian society, had become an ugly urban landscape full of polluting factories owned by greedy Jewish capitalists. Even worse in Chamberlain&#x27;s opinion, capitalism had led the English into a process of racial degeneration, democracy and rule by the Jews. Chamberlain wrote with disgust how the sons of the English aristocracy &quot;disappear from society to make money&quot;, leading to a warped &quot;moral compass&quot; on their part in contrast to Germany where the either tended to their estates or had careers in the Army. Chamberlain&#x27;s discussion of Britain ended with the lament that his idealised &quot;Merry Old England&quot; no longer existed, with Chamberlain writing:

We were merry, we are merry no longer. The complete decline of country life and the equally complete victory of God Mammon, the deity of Industry and Trade, have caused the true, harmless, refreshing merriness to betake itself out of England.

Germany by contrast in Chamberlain&#x27;s view, had preserved its racial purity and by having an authoritarian government and a welfare state, had avoided both &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism and Jewish rule. It was for this reason that Chamberlain alleged that Britain had started World War I in 1914 to destroy Germany.

Chamberlain received the Iron Cross from the Kaiser, with whom he was in regular correspondence, in 1916. By this time, Chamberlain&#x27;s obsessive anti-Semitism had reached the point that Chamberlain was suffering from nightmares in which he was kidnapped and sentenced to death by the Jews. In 1915, Chamberlain wrote proudly in a letter to a friend that: &quot;My lawyer friend in Munich tells me there is no living being whom the Jews hate more than I.&quot; In another essay, Chamberlain wrote the &quot;pure Germanic force&quot; had to be saved from the &quot;disgusting worm&quot; (the phrase &quot;disgusting worm&quot; was often used by Wagner to describe the Jews). Chamberlain wrote the purpose of this &quot;struggle&quot; was &quot;salvation from the claws of the un-German and anti-German&quot;, going on to quote from Wagner&#x27;s 1850 anti-Semitic essay &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot; that &quot;Against this devil&#x27;s brood stands Germany as God&#x27;s champion: Siegfried against the worm!&quot;
=== War aims ===
During the war years, Chamberlain was one of the &quot;annexationists&quot; who wanted the war to end with Germany annexing most of Europe, Africa and Asia to give the &quot;Reich&quot; the &quot;world power status&quot; he believed it deserved. As such, Chamberlain worked closely with the Pan-German League, the Conservatives and the &quot;völkische&quot; groups to mobilise public support for the maximum war aims he sought. Chamberlain was a founding member of the Independent Commission for a German Peace, and in July 1915 he signed the Address of the Intellectuals, a petition signed by 1,347 teachers, writers, professors, and theologians asking the government to win the war in order to annex as much territory as possible. Much of this propaganda including Chamberlain&#x27;s essays in support of the maximum war aims had a very strong anti-Semitic character, as Chamberlain claimed that it was the entire German Jewish community who were supposedly seeking a compromise peace to end the war, and were preventing the full mobilization of Germany&#x27;s power that would allow the &quot;Reich&quot; to win the war. In a letter to his friend Prince Maximilian of Baden, Chamberlain wrote:

I learned today from a man who is especially well-placed to observe these things—even when they go on secretly—that the Jews are completely intoxicated by their success in Germany—first from the millions they have gained through the war, then because of the praise showered on them in all official quarters, and thirdly from the protection they and their machinations enjoy from the censor. Thus, already they are beginning to lose their heads and reach a degree of insolence which may allow us to hope for a flood-tide of reaction. May God grant it!.

=== Wartime intrigues ===
In support of a harder line both in the war and on the home front, Chamberlain involved himself in the intrigues to oust Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg as Chancellor and replace him with the &quot;hard man&quot;, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. In Chamberlain&#x27;s opinion, if only Germany were to wage the war more ruthlessly and brutally, then the war would be won. Chamberlain loathed Bethmann Hollweg whom he saw as an inept leader who simply did not have the will to win. Chamberlain had an unbounded confidence in the ability of the Army and Navy to win the war, but on the home front, Chamberlain believed the &quot;Reich&quot; was &quot;leaderless&quot; as he viewed Bethmann Hollweg as a Jewish &quot;puppet&quot; unwilling and unable to stop defeatism, corruption or the demand for more democracy. Besides supporting Tirpitz as Chancellor, Chamberlain was all for adopting unrestricted submarine warfare—even at the risk of provoking the United States into the war—as the best way of starving Britain into surrender. Chamberlain was also a very public supporter of Zeppelin raids to destroy British cities. After a discussion with his friend and admirer, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Chamberlain published a newspaper essay in July 1915 complaining that the government had imposed far too many restrictions on Zeppelin raids in order to save innocent British lives, and he argued that his country should bomb British cities with no concern for lives of civilians as ordinary British people deserved to die.

The campaign by the annexationists against Bethmann Hollweg was in large part motivated by the fact that the annexationists believed that Bethmann Hollweg was not one of them. Had Chamberlain or any of the other annexationists been aware of the secret September Programme of 1914 which laid out Germany&#x27;s war aims under the assumption that Paris would soon fall, they would have had a different opinion of him. The aims included making a vassal state of Belgium, annexing Luxembourg and portions of France, expanding German colonies in Africa and increasing German influence in Eastern Europe at the expense of the Russian Empire. Bethmann Hollweg&#x27;s refusal to support the annexationists in public was due to pragmatic political considerations, namely, his need for majority Social Democratic co-operation in the &quot;Reichstag&quot; as opposed to being against the annexationists as Chamberlain mistakenly believed.

Much of Chamberlain&#x27;s strident, aggressive and embittered rhetoric reflected the fact that the annexationists were a minority in Germany, albeit a significant, vocal, well organised minority with many influential members inside and outside the government, but a minority nonetheless. Chamberlain regarded the refusal of the democratic parties like the left-wing SPD, the right-of-the-centre &quot;Zentrum&quot; and the liberal Progressives to join the annexationist movement as essentially high treason. By 1917 Bethmann Hollweg had turned against the idea of annexations. At the 23 April Kreuznach conference on war aims, when Hindenburg and Ludendorff pressured him to agree to annexations in France, Belgium and Russia, he refused. In July 1917 Hindenburg and Ludendorff, with the support of a significant portion of the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, successfully maneuvered to have Bethmann Hollweg dismissed and replaced with Georg Michaelis as Chancellor. Chamberlain&#x27;s preferred candidate as Chancellor, Admiral Tirpitz, was passed over. Tirpitz was an intelligent, media-savvy, charismatic political intriguer with a desperate hunger for political power, but the duumvirate of Hindenburg and Ludendorff regarded Tirpitz as Chancellor as too much of a threat to their own power. The Reichstag Peace Resolution of July 1917—in which the SPD, &quot;Zentrum&quot; and the Progressives all joined forces to vote for a resolution asking the government to start peace talks at once on the basis of a return to the status quo of 1914—&quot;inflamed the paranoia and desperation of the right. The annexationists prepared for a war to the knife against ... domestic &quot;traitors&quot;.&quot; Chamberlain was disappointed that Tirpitz had not been appointed Chancellor; however, he was overjoyed with Bethmann Hollweg&#x27;s resignation and welcomed the increased power of Hindenburg and Ludendorff in political affairs as giving Germany the sort of government it needed. Chamberlain was always inclined to hero worship, and for him, Hindenburg and Ludendorff were the greatest of a long line of German heroes. Chamberlain wrote in 1917 that: &quot;Had Hindenburg and Ludendorff stood on the first day in their rightful place, the peace would in all probability have been dictated in Paris before the end of 1914.&quot;

=== Postwar vision ===
Besides being an annexationist who wanted to see the war end with Germany as the world&#x27;s greatest power, Chamberlain also advocated a set of wide-ranging changes to German society intended to achieve a &quot;rebirth&quot; of Germany. Chamberlain wanted to see the Spirit of 1914 made permanent, to convert the wartime &quot;Burgfrieden&quot; (&quot;peace within a castle under siege&quot;) into a peacetime &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (people&#x27;s community). He also wanted a new economic and social system that would be a &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism and socialism to bring about the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; organized along corporatist lines. To achieve this, Chamberlain called for the end to any remaining democratic features the constitution of 1871 still possessed and the creation of a pure dictatorship; for the end of the capitalist system with the state to nationalize huge sections of the economy while at the same time respecting the right to private property; and for the militarization of society on a new scale. Chamberlain was somewhat vague about how this corporatist society would work in practice, but what he wanted was rule by an oligarchy of aristocrats, intellectuals, bureaucrats and military officers who would run a &quot;planned economy&quot; via &quot;scientific management&quot;. The entire German people (except for the Jews, whom Chamberlain believed did not belong in Germany) were to be united by a common loyalty to the Emperor. A fanatical monarchist, Chamberlain saw the monarchy as the bedrock of German life, writing in his 1915 book &quot;Politische Ideale&quot;: &quot;Whoever speaks of a republic in Germany belongs on the gallows; the monarchical idea is here a holy law of life.&quot; At the same time, Chamberlain envisioned a Germany that would somehow remain the leading industrial power at the forefront of modern technology while at the same time become a romantic, agrarian society where ordinary people would work the land and retain their traditional deference to the aristocracy. Chamberlain was also vague about how this could be achieved, writing only that a &quot;planned economy&quot;, &quot;scientific management&quot; and an economically interventionist state committed to social reforms would make it all possible.

=== Tensions with Wilhelm ===
After Germany&#x27;s diplomatic defeat in the Second Moroccan Crisis in 1911, Wilhelm II became the &quot;Schattenkaiser&quot; (the &quot;Shadow Emperor&quot;), an increasingly reclusive figure who was seen less and less in public. The war further reinforced Wilhelm&#x27;s tendency to avoid the public spotlight as much as possible. In private, Chamberlain grew disillusioned with his friend, complaining that instead of being the &quot;Aryan soldier king&quot; leading the &quot;Reich&quot; to victory, the Kaiser was a weak leader as the &quot;Shadow Emperor&quot; was hiding himself away in deep seclusion at his hunting lodges. As a monarchist, Chamberlain was worried about how Wilhelm was hurting his own reputation, and often vainly urged the Kaiser to appear in public more often. Chamberlain wrote in 1916 that Wilhelm had an &quot;absolute incapability for judging character&quot; and was now being &quot;forced to obey a Frankfurt pimp&quot;, the last being a disparaging reference to Bethmann Hollweg. Chamberlain was always very careful to avoid attacking Wilhelm in public, but his violent press attacks against Bethmann Hollweg caused something of a rift with the Kaiser who felt Chamberlain&#x27;s very public criticism of the Chancellor was also an indirect attack on him. Nonetheless, despite the strains the war imposed on their friendship, Chamberlain and Wilhelm continued to write throughout the war, but pointedly did not meet in person anymore, though Chamberlain&#x27;s increasing paralysis also played a part. Wilhelm wrote to Chamberlain on 15 January 1917, stating:

The war is a struggle between two , the Teutonic-German for morality, right, loyalty and faith, genuine humanity, truth and real freedom, against ... the worship of Mammon, the power of money, pleasure, land-hunger, lies, betrayal, deceit and—last but not least—treacherous assassination! These two cannot be reconciled or tolerate one another, one must be &quot;victorious&quot;, the other must &quot;go under&quot;!

Chamberlain wrote back to Wilhelm on 20 January 1917:

England has fallen totally into the hands of the Jews and the Americans. A person does not understand this war unless he realizes that it is in the deepest sense the war of &quot;Judentum&quot; and its near relative Americanism for the control of the world—a war against Christianity, against &quot;Bildung&quot;, moral strength, uncommercial art, against every idealist perspective on life, and for the benefit of a world that would include only industry, finance, and trade—in short, unrestricted plutocracy. All the other additional factors—Russian greed, French vanity, Italian bombast, the envious and cowardly spirit of the neutrals—are whipped up, made crazy; the Jew and the Yankee are the driving forces that operate consciously and in a certain sense have hitherto been victorious or at all events successful ... It is the war of modern mechanized &quot;civilization&quot; against the ancient, holy and continually reborn culture of chosen races. Machines will crush both spirit and soul in their clutches.

=== Obsession with the &quot;inner enemy&quot; ===
Chamberlain continued to believe until the end of the war that Germany would win only if the people willed victory enough, and this sort of ideological war between &quot;German idealism&quot; vs. &quot;Jewish materialism&quot; could only end with one side utterly crushing the other. In the last two years of the war, Chamberlain became obsessed with defeating the &quot;inner enemy&quot; that he believed was holding Germany back. In this regard, Chamberlain frequently asserted that Germany was not one nation, but two; on one side, the &quot;patriots&quot; like Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, General Erich Ludendorff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, Wolfgang Kapp, J. F. Lehmann and Count von Reventlow; and on the other, the &quot;traitors&quot; which included people like Philipp Scheidemann, Eduard David and Matthias Erzberger. No compromise between these two Germanies was possible or desirable, Chamberlain argued, and one would have to be destroyed. Chamberlain&#x27;s wartime writings against the &quot;inner enemy&quot; anticipated the &quot;stab-in-the-back legend&quot; which emerged after 1918.

Chamberlain was a founding member of both the extreme-right, anti-Semitic &quot;Deutschlands Erneuerung&quot; newspaper, and of the Fatherland Party in 1917. The character of the Fatherland Party was well illustrated by an infamous incident in January 1918 when at a Fatherland Party rally in Berlin, a group of disabled war veterans were invited to debate the Fatherland Party&#x27;s speakers. The wounded veterans all declared that they were now against the war and had become pacifists. The crippled veterans deplored the Fatherland Party&#x27;s militarism and demand for war to go until victory, regardless of how many more would have to die or end up living with destroyed bodies. The ultra-nationalists of the Fatherland Party were so enraged by what the crippled veterans had to say that the audience stormed the stage, and beat the disabled veterans senseless. Chamberlain, who lived in Bayreuth. was not present during the Berlin rally, but expressed his approval of what had happened.

During the war, most Germans saw Britain as the main enemy, and so Chamberlain&#x27;s status as the Englishman who supported the &quot;Reich&quot; made him an even more famous celebrity in Germany than he had been before 1914. Chamberlain&#x27;s wartime essays were widely read. The first set of essays sold 160,000 copies within six months of publication while the second set sold 75,000 copies within six weeks of publication. Between 1914 and 1918 about 1 million copies of Chamberlain&#x27;s essays were sold, making Chamberlain one of Germany&#x27;s best read writers during the war. In December 1915, it was estimated that between the direct sales of Chamberlain&#x27;s essays and reprints in newspapers, at least 3 million people had read Chamberlain&#x27;s war-time writings.

Such was the power of Chamberlain as a public figure that in August 1916 the German Jewish industrialist Walther Rathenau—whom Chamberlain had often accused of profiteering—mailed Chamberlain a copy of his bank balance sheets, which showed that Rathenau was in fact getting poorer as a result of the war, and politely asked Chamberlain to stop accusing him of war profiteering. Rathenau&#x27;s appeal made no impression, and Chamberlain continued to accuse Rathenau of war profiteering right until he was assassinated in 1922.

In 1917 Chamberlain wrote about the liberal &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; newspaper: &quot;No knowledgeable person, can doubt that the enemy is at work among us ... whenever England has something up her sleeve against the interests of Germany, she uses the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot;.&quot; Bernhard Guttmann, the editor of the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; sued Chamberlain for libel about that article. In August 1918, the sensational libel trial which attracted much media attention opened. Chamberlain was defended by Heinrich Class and Adolf Jacobsen. On 16 August 1918, the trial ended with the judge ruling that Chamberlain was guilty of libel and fined him 1,500 marks. The guilty verdict set off a storm in right-wing circles, who quickly held several successful fund-raisers to pay Chamberlain&#x27;s fine.

==Hitler&#x27;s mentor==

=== November Revolution ===
In November 1918, Chamberlain was completely shattered by Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, a defeat he believed to be impossible, as well as by the November Revolution, which had toppled his beloved monarchy. Adding to his bitterness, Chamberlain was now so paralyzed that he could no longer leave his bed, something that he believed to be the result of poisoning by the British secret service. Chamberlain saw both the defeat and the revolution as the work of the Jews, writing in 1919 that Germany was now under the &quot;supremacy of the Jews&quot;. In his last years, Chamberlain&#x27;s anti-Semitic writings grew ever more violent and bloodthirsty.

In March 1920, Chamberlain supported the Kapp Putsch against the Weimar Republic, which he called the &quot;Judenrepublik&quot; (&quot;Jewish Republic&quot;), and was even more embittered by its failure. The Kapp putsch was defeated by a general strike called by the Social Democrats which shut down the entire German economy. A young activist Josef Stolzing-Cerny and a Chamberlain protégé who had participated in the Kapp putsch wrote to Chamberlain after its failure: &quot;Unfortunately Kapp was not all &#x27;the man with the lion heart&#x27;, much rather the man with the beer heart, for he continually used all his energies befuddling his brain with alcohol. ... In the same situation a Bismarck or a Napoleon would have hunted the whole Jewish-socialist republic to the devil.&quot; Stolzing-Cerny went on to criticize Kapp for not unleashing the &quot;Freikorps&quot; Marinebrigade Ehrhardt which had taken Berlin against the Jews of Berlin, instead ordering the &quot;Freikorps&quot; to keep order. After the failure of the putsch, Chamberlain no longer considered Wolfgang Kapp to be one of his heroes, and instead damned him as a weak-willed coward all too typical of German conservatives who talked tough, but never followed up their words with action. More importantly, the failure of the Kapp putsch to a certain extent discredited traditional German conservatism in Chamberlain&#x27;s eyes, and led him on the search for a more radical alternative, a type of &quot;German socialism&quot; that would offer a &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism and socialism.

=== Admiring Hitler ===
In January 1921, Stolzing-Cerny, who joined the NSDAP in December 1920, wrote to Chamberlain about the new man on the political scene, &quot;one Adolf Hitler, an Austrian worker, a man of extraordinary oratorical talents and an astonishingly rich political knowledge who knows marvelously how to thrill the masses&quot;. Initially, Chamberlain was hesitant about Hitler, believing that he might be another Kapp, but after the &quot;battle of Coburg&quot;, in which Hitler had personally fought with his followers in a street battle against the Communists, Chamberlain started to see Hitler as someone who practised what he preached. From that time onwards, Chamberlain started to closely follow and admire Hitler, whom he saw as &quot;Germany&#x27;s savior&quot;. Hitler in his turn had read &quot;The Foundations&quot;, Chamberlain&#x27;s biography of Wagner, and many of his wartime essays, and was much influenced by all that Chamberlain had written. British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, a biographer of Hitler, writes that

... Hitler drew heavily for his ideas from well known anti-Semitic tracts such as those by Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Adolf Wahrmund and especially, the arch-popularizer Theodor Fritsch (one of whose emphasis was the alleged sexual abuse of women by the Jews)...

The fact that Hitler was an ardent Wagnerite who adored Wagner&#x27;s music gave Chamberlain and Hitler a mutual ground for friendship beyond their shared hatred of the Jews. Likewise, Joseph Goebbels had been converted to the ideology after reading Chamberlain&#x27;s books and essays, and came to the conclusion on the basis of Chamberlain&#x27;s writings that the West could only be saved by removing the Jews from German society. During this period, Chamberlain, who was practically a member of the Wagner family, started to push for the Bayreuth Festival to become openly identified with politics, and to turn the previously apolitical festival into a rally.

Despite his paralysis, Chamberlain whose mind was still sharp, remained active as a writer, maintaining a correspondence with a whole gamut of figures from Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz to the radical anti-Semitic journalist Theodor Fritsch, the leader of the &quot;völkisch&quot; &quot;Hammerbund&quot; (&quot;Hammer League&quot;). From his exile in the Netherlands, the former Kaiser wrote to Chamberlain in 1922 to tell him that thanks to his essays, he had become a Marcionist and now rejected the Old Testament. Wilhelm claimed that on the basis of Chamberlain&#x27;s work, he now knew that what had become the Old Testament was in fact a Zoroastrian text from ancient Persia and was therefore &quot;Aryan&quot;. The former Kaiser claimed that the Jews had stolen and rewritten this sacred text from the Aryan Persians, ending his letter: &quot;Let us free ourselves from the &quot;Judentum&quot; with its Jawe!&quot; In 1923, Wilhelm wrote to tell Chamberlain of his belief that not only were the Jews &quot;not our religious forebears&quot;, but that Jesus was &quot;not a Jew&quot;, was instead an Aryan &quot;of exceptional beauty, tall and slim with a noble face inspiring respect and love; his hair blond shading into chestnut brown, his arms and hands noble and exquisitely formed&quot;.

In 1923 Chamberlain met Adolf Hitler in Bayreuth, and in September he sat in his wheelchair next to Hitler during the &quot;völkisch&quot; &quot;German Day&quot; paramilitary parade. In September 1923 he wrote a grateful and highly admiring open letter to the NSDAP leader. Chamberlain, paralysed and despondent after Germany&#x27;s losses in World War I, wrote to Hitler after his first visit in September 1923:
 Chamberlain&#x27;s letter—which made him into the first celebrity to endorse the NSDAP—caused a media sensation in Germany and led Hitler to rejoice &quot;like a child&quot; at the news. When Hitler staged the Munich Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923, Chamberlain wrote an essay for the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; entitled &quot;God Wills It!&quot; calling on all Germans who love Germany to join the &quot;putsch&quot;. After the failure of the Munich Putsch, Chamberlain wrote: &quot;We are deeply affected by this tragic fate, Jew and Jesuit can now triumph again!&quot;.

=== Joining the Nazis ===
Chamberlain joined the Nazi Party and contributed to its publications. Its primary journal, the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot;, dedicated five columns to praising him on his 70th birthday, describing &quot;The Foundations&quot; as the &quot;gospel of the National Socialist movement&quot;. In January 1924, Chamberlain published an essay praising Hitler as one of the &quot;rare beautiful beings... a man of genuine simplicity with a fascinating gaze&quot; whose words &quot;always come directly from the heart&quot;. Chamberlain praised Hitler for embarking upon a &quot;&quot; (&quot;war of destruction&quot;) against all of Germany&#x27;s enemies. Chamberlain further wrote about Hitler—whom he viewed as the greatest of all his heroes—that:

Because he [Hitler] is no mere phrasemonger, but consistently pursues his thought to an end and draws his conclusions from it, he recognizes and proclaims that one cannot simultaneously embrace Jesus and those that crucified him. That is the splendid thing about Hitler—his courage! ... In this respect he reminds one of Luther. And whence come the courage of these two men? It derives from the holy seriousness each has for the cause! Hitler utters no word he does not mean in earnest; his speeches contain no padding or vague, provisional statements ... but the result of this is that he is decried as a visionary dreamer. People consider Hitler a dreamer whose head is full of impossible schemes and yet a renowned and original historian called him &quot;the most creative mind since Bismarck in the area of statecraft.&quot; I believe ... we are all inclined to view those things as impractical that we do not already see accomplished before us. He, for example, finds it impossible to share our conviction about the pernicious, even murderous influence of Jewry on the German &quot;Volk&quot; and not to take action; if one sees the danger, then steps must be taken against it with utter dispatch. I daresay everyone recognizes this, but nobody risks speaking out; nobody ventures to extract the consequences of his thoughts for his actions; nobody except Hitler. ... This man has worked like a divine blessing, cheering hearts, opening men&#x27;s eyes to clearly seen goals, enlivening their spirits, kindling their capacity for love and for indignation, hardening their courage and resoluteness. Yet we still need him badly: May God who sent him to us preserve him for many years as a &quot;blessing for the German Fatherland!&quot;

After the failure of the Munich Putsch, Hitler was convicted of high treason and imprisoned. When the 1924 Bayreuth Festival opened, Chamberlain&#x27;s efforts to identify the festival with politics finally bore fruit. The Bayreuth Festspielhaus opera house and the way leading up to it were decorated with symbols like the swastika, parades by the nationalist were held outside the , prominent leaders like General Erich Ludendorff appeared on the stage to give a speech attacking the Weimar Republic before one of the operas was performed, and a petition was offered to the audiences demanding that Hitler be pardoned. The 1924 festival led to 10,000 people in one night signing the petition asking for Hitler&#x27;s release. From his prison cell at Landsberg prison, Hitler wrote to Siegfried Wagner expressing his sorrow about being unable to attend his beloved Bayreuth Festival and to express his thanks to the entire Wagner family and Chamberlain for turning the Bayreuth festival into a rally, adding that when he got out of prison, he would come to Bayreuth as &quot;the first witness and herald&quot; of Germany&#x27;s rebirth. Hitler stated this would be the best medicine for Chamberlain&#x27;s health as &quot;the road to Berlin&quot; started in Bayreuth. In May 1926, one year before Chamberlain&#x27;s death, Hitler and Goebbels visited him in Bayreuth. Chamberlain assured Hitler of his belief that he was the &quot;chosen one&quot; destined to lead Germany back to greatness after the defeat of 1918, to make the &quot;Reich&quot; a world power, and finally smash the Jews. Much of Hitler&#x27;s genuine affection for Chamberlain was due to the fact that Chamberlain never lost his faith in Hitler&#x27;s potential, even at time in the mid-1920s when the NSDAP was faring very poorly.

=== Death ===
Chamberlain continued living in Bayreuth until his death in 1927. Chamberlain died on 9 January 1927 and his ashes were buried at the Bayreuth cemetery in the presence of Hitler along with several highly ranked members of the Nazi Party.

==Impact of &quot;The Foundations&quot;==
During his lifetime Chamberlain&#x27;s works were read widely throughout Europe, and especially in Germany. His reception was particularly favourable among Germany&#x27;s conservative elite. Kaiser Wilhelm II patronised Chamberlain, distributing copies of &quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot; among the German Army, and seeing that &quot;The Foundations&quot; was carried in German libraries and included in the school curricula. In 1932 in an essay entitled &quot;Anti-Semitics&quot; denouncing antisemitism, the &quot;homeless left&quot; German journalist Carl von Ossietzky wrote: Intellectual anti-Semitism was the special prerogative of Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who, in &quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot;, concretized the fantasies of Count Arthur de Gobineau, which had penetrated to Bayreuth. He translated them from the language of harmless snobbery into [the language] of a modernized, seductive mysticism. Ossietzky ended his essay with the warning: &quot;Today there is a strong smell of blood in the air. Literary anti-Semitism forges the moral weapon for murder. Sturdy and honest lads will take care of the rest.&quot;

&quot;The Foundations&quot; would prove to be a seminal work in German nationalism. Due to its success, aided by Chamberlain&#x27;s association with the Wagner circle, its ideas of Aryan supremacy and a struggle against Jewish influence spread widely across the German state at the beginning of the century. If it did not form the framework of later Nazi ideology, at the very least it provided its adherents with a seeming intellectual justification. Many of Chamberlain&#x27;s ideas such as his emphasis on a racial struggle between Aryans vs. Jews for world domination; his championing of &quot;world power status&quot; for Germany; his call for a &quot;planned economy&quot; (something realized in 1936 when Hitler brought in the First Four Year Plan which saw the German state take over the economy); his vision of Germany becoming the &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (people&#x27;s community&quot;); his demand for a &quot;third way&quot; between capitalism and socialism; his total opposition to democracy; and his nostalgia for an agrarian lifestyle were central to Nazism. The only Nazi idea that Chamberlain missed was &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space), the perceived need for Germany to colonize Eastern Europe while displacing the existing population to make room for Aryan colonists. However, there were differences in that Chamberlain was always a monarchist and believed that when his friend Hitler came to power, he would restore the monarchy and put his other friend Wilhelm II back on the throne. Moreover, Chamberlain was just one of the many &quot;völkische&quot; thinkers who influenced Hitler.

Adolf Hitler, while still growing as a political figure in Germany, visited him several times (in 1923 and in 1926, together with Joseph Goebbels) at the Wagner family&#x27;s property in Bayreuth. Chamberlain&#x27;s ideas particularly influenced Alfred Rosenberg, who became the Nazi Party&#x27;s in-house philosopher. In 1909, some months before his 17th birthday, Rosenberg picked up a copy of Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;The Foundations&quot; and wrote of the moment: &quot;I felt electrified; I wrote down the title and went straight to the bookshop.&quot; In 1930 Rosenberg published &quot;The Myth of the Twentieth Century&quot;, a homage to and continuation of Chamberlain&#x27;s work. Rosenberg had accompanied Hitler when he called upon Wagner&#x27;s widow, Cosima, in October 1923 when he met her son-in-law. Hitler told the ailing Chamberlain he was working on his own book which, he intended, should do for Weimar-era Germany what Chamberlain&#x27;s book had done for Imperial Germany.

Beyond the Kaiser and the NSDAP, assessments were mixed. The French Germanic scholar Edmond Vermeil considered Chamberlain&#x27;s ideas &quot;essentially shoddy&quot;, but the anti-Nazi German author Konrad Heiden, despite objections to Chamberlain&#x27;s racial ideas, described him as &quot;one of the most astonishing talents in the history of the German mind, a of knowledge and profound ideas&quot;. In a 1939 work Martin Heidegger (himself a former Nazi) dismissed Chamberlain&#x27;s work as presenting a subjective, individualistic (fabricated worldview).

<text>Voice or voicing is a term used in phonetics and phonology to characterize speech sounds (usually consonants). Speech sounds can be described as either voiceless (otherwise known as &quot;unvoiced&quot;) or voiced.

The term, however, is used to refer to two separate concepts:
*Voicing can refer to the &quot;articulatory process&quot; in which the vocal folds vibrate, its primary use in phonetics to describe phones, which are particular speech sounds. 
*It can also refer to a classification of speech sounds that tend to be associated with vocal cord vibration but may not actually be voiced at the articulatory level. That is the term&#x27;s primary use in phonology: to describe phonemes; while in phonetics its primary use is to describe phones.

For example, voicing accounts for the difference between the pair of sounds associated with the English letters ⟨s⟩ and ⟨z⟩. The two sounds are transcribed as and to distinguish them from the English letters, which have several possible pronunciations, depending on the context. If one places the fingers on the voice box (i.e., the location of the Adam&#x27;s apple in the upper throat), one can feel a vibration while [z] is pronounced but not with [s]. (For a more detailed, technical explanation, see modal voice and phonation.) In most European languages, with a notable exception being Icelandic, vowels and other sonorants (consonants such as &quot;m, n, l,&quot; and &quot;r)&quot; are modally voiced.

Yidiny has no underlyingly voiceless consonants, only voiced ones.

When used to classify speech sounds, voiced and unvoiced are merely labels used to group phones and phonemes together for the purposes of classification.

==Notation==

The International Phonetic Alphabet has distinct letters for many voiceless and voiced pairs of consonants (the obstruents), such as . In addition, there is a diacritic for voicedness: ⟨⟩. Diacritics are typically used with letters for prototypically voiceless sounds.

In Unicode, the symbols are encoded and .

The extensions to the International Phonetic Alphabet have a notation for partial voicing and devoicing as well as for prevoicing:

Partial voicing can mean light but continuous voicing, discontinuous voicing, or discontinuities in the degree of voicing. For example, could be an with (some) voicing in the middle and could be with (some) devoicing in the middle.

Partial voicing can also be indicated in the normal IPA with transcriptions like and .

==In English==
The distinction between the articulatory use of voice and the phonological use rests on the distinction between phone (represented between square brackets) and phoneme (represented between slashes). The difference is best illustrated by a rough example.

The English word &quot;nods&quot; is made up of a sequence of phonemes, represented symbolically as , or the sequence of , , , and . Each symbol is an abstract representation of a phoneme. That awareness is an inherent part of speakers&#x27; mental grammar that allows them to recognise words.

However, phonemes are not sounds in themselves. Rather, phonemes are, in a sense, converted to phones before being spoken. The phoneme, for instance, can actually be pronounced as either the phone or the phone since is frequently devoiced, even in fluent speech, especially at the end of an utterance. The sequence of phones for &quot;nods&quot; might be transcribed as or , depending on the presence or strength of this devoicing. While the phone has articulatory voicing, the phone does not have it.

What complicates the matter is that for English, consonant phonemes are classified as either voiced or voiceless even though it is not the primary distinctive feature between them. Still, the classification is used as a stand-in for phonological processes, such as vowel lengthening that occurs before voiced consonants but not before unvoiced consonants or vowel quality changes (the sound of the vowel) in some dialects of English that occur before unvoiced but not voiced consonants. Such processes allow English speakers to continue to perceive difference between voiced and voiceless consonants when the devoicing of the former would otherwise make them sound identical to the latter.

English has four pairs of fricative phonemes that can be divided into a table by place of articulation and voicing. The voiced fricatives can readily be felt to have voicing throughout the duration of the phone especially when they occur between vowels.

However, in the class of consonants called stops, such as , the contrast is more complicated for English. The &quot;voiced&quot; sounds do not typically feature articulatory voicing throughout the sound. The difference between the unvoiced stop phonemes and the voiced stop phonemes is not just a matter of whether articulatory voicing is present or not. Rather, it includes when voicing starts (if at all), the presence of aspiration (airflow burst following the release of the closure) and the duration of the closure and aspiration.

English voiceless stops are generally aspirated at the beginning of a stressed syllable, and in the same context, their voiced counterparts are voiced only partway through. In more narrow phonetic transcription, the voiced symbols are maybe used only to represent the presence of articulatory voicing, and aspiration is represented with a superscript &quot;h&quot;.

When the consonants come at the end of a syllable, however, what distinguishes them is quite different. Voiceless phonemes are typically unaspirated, glottalized and the closure itself may not even be released, making it sometimes difficult to hear the difference between, for example, &quot;light&quot; and &quot;like&quot;. However, auditory cues remain to distinguish between voiced and voiceless sounds, such as what has been described above, like the length of the preceding vowel.

Other English sounds, the vowels and sonorants, are normally fully voiced. However, they may be devoiced in certain positions, especially after aspirated consonants, as in &quot;coffee&quot;, &quot;tree&quot;, and &quot;play&quot; in which the voicing is delayed to the extent of missing the sonorant or vowel altogether.

==Degrees of voicing==
There are two variables to degrees of voicing: intensity (discussed under phonation), and duration (discussed under voice onset time). When a sound is described as &quot;half voiced&quot; or &quot;partially voiced&quot;, it is not always clear whether that means that the voicing is weak (low intensity) or if the voicing occurs during only part of the sound (short duration). In the case of English, it is the latter.

Juǀʼhoansi and some of its neighboring languages are typologically unusual in having contrastive partially-voiced consonants. They have aspirate and ejective consonants, which are normally incompatible with voicing, in voiceless and voiced pairs. The consonants start out voiced but become voiceless partway through and allow normal aspiration or ejection. They are and and a similar series of clicks, Lun Bawang contrasts them with plain voiced and voicelesses like /p, b, b͡p/.

==Voice and tenseness==
There are languages with two sets of contrasting obstruents that are labelled vs. even though there is no involvement of voice (or voice onset time) in that contrast. That happens, for instance, in several Alemannic German dialects. Because voice is not involved, this is explained as a contrast in tenseness, called a fortis and lenis contrast.

There is a hypothesis that the contrast between fortis and lenis consonants is related to the contrast between voiceless and voiced consonants. That relation is based on sound perception as well as on sound production, where consonant voice, tenseness and length are only different manifestations of a common sound feature.

<doc id="598336" wikidata="Q2409399" url="?curid=598336" title="Renal medulla">
<text>The renal medulla (Latin: &quot;medulla renis&quot; &#x27;marrow of the kidney&#x27;) is the innermost part of the kidney. The renal medulla is split up into a number of sections, known as the renal pyramids. Blood enters into the kidney via the renal artery, which then splits up to form the segmental arteries which then branch to form interlobar arteries. The interlobar arteries each in turn branch into arcuate arteries, which in turn branch to form interlobular arteries, and these finally reach the glomeruli. At the glomerulus the blood reaches a highly disfavourable pressure gradient and a large exchange surface area, which forces the serum portion of the blood out of the vessel and into the renal tubules. Flow continues through the renal tubules, including the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, through the distal tubule and finally leaves the kidney by means of the collecting duct, leading to the renal pelvis, the dilated portion of the ureter.

The renal medulla contains the structures of the nephrons responsible for maintaining the salt and water balance of the blood. These structures include the vasa rectae (both spuria and vera), the venulae rectae, the medullary capillary plexus, the loop of Henle, and the collecting tubule. The renal medulla is hypertonic to the filtrate in the nephron and aids in the reabsorption of water.

Blood is filtered in the glomerulus by solute size. Ions such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and calcium are easily filtered, as is glucose. Proteins are not passed through the glomerular filter because of their large size, and do not appear in the filtrate or urine unless a disease process has affected the glomerular capsule or the proximal and distal convoluted tubules of the nephron.

Though the renal medulla only receives a small percentage of the renal blood flow, the oxygen extraction is very high, causing a low oxygen tension and more importantly, a critical sensitivity to hypotension, hypoxia, and blood flow. The renal medulla extracts oxygen at a ratio of ~80% making it exquisitely sensitive to small changes in renal blood flow. The mechanisms of many perioperative renal insults are based on the disruption of adequate blood flow (and therefore oxygen delivery) to the renal medulla.

==Interstitium==
The medullary interstitium is the tissue surrounding the loop of Henle in the medulla. It functions in renal water reabsorption by building up a high hypertonicity, which draws water out of the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle and the collecting duct system. Hypertonicity, in turn, is created by an efflux of urea from the inner medullary collecting duct.

==Pyramids==

Renal pyramids (or malpighian pyramids or Malpighi&#x27;s pyramids named after Marcello Malpighi, a seventeenth-century anatomist) are cone-shaped tissues of the kidney. In humans, the renal medulla is made up of 10 to 18 of these conical subdivisions. The broad &quot;base&quot; of each pyramid faces the renal cortex, and its , or papilla, points internally towards the pelvis. The pyramids appear striped because they are formed by straight parallel segments of nephrons&#x27; Loops of Henle and collecting ducts. The base of each pyramid originates at the corticomedullary border and the apex terminates in a papilla, which lies within a minor calyx, made of parallel bundles of urine collecting tubules.

==Papilla==
The renal papilla is the location where the renal pyramids in the medulla empty urine into the minor calyx in the kidney. Histologically it is marked by medullary collecting ducts converging to form a papillary duct to channel the fluid. Transitional epithelium begins to be seen.

===Clinical significance===
Some chemicals toxic to the kidney, called nephrotoxins, damage the renal papillae. Damage to the renal papillae may result in death to cells in this region of the kidney, called renal papillary necrosis. The most common toxic causes of renal papillary necrosis are NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, and phenylbutazone, in combination with dehydration. Perturbed renal papillary development has also been shown to be associated with onset of functional obstruction and renal fibrosis.

Renal papillary damage has also been associated with nephrolithiasis and can be quantified according to the papillary grading score, which accounts for contour, pitting, plugging and Randall&#x27;s plaque.

<doc id="598345" wikidata="Q1332343" url="?curid=598345" title="Cell site">
<text>A cell site, cell phone tower, cell base tower, or cellular base station is a cellular-enabled mobile device site where antennas and electronic communications equipment are placed (typically on a radio mast, tower, or other raised structure) to create a cell, or adjacent cells, in a cellular network. The raised structure typically supports antenna and one or more sets of transmitter/receivers transceivers, digital signal processors, control electronics, a GPS receiver for timing (for CDMA2000/IS-95 or GSM systems), primary and backup electrical power sources, and sheltering.

Multiple cellular providers often save money by mounting their antennas on a common shared mast; since separate systems use different frequencies, antennas can be located close together without interfering with each other. Some provider companies operate multiple cellular networks and similarly use colocated base stations for two or more cellular networks, (CDMA2000 or GSM, for example).

Cell sites are sometimes required to be inconspicuous; they may be blended with the surrounding area or mounted on buildings or advertising towers. Preserved treescapes can often hide cell towers inside an artificial or preserved tree. These installations are generally referred to as concealed cell sites or stealth cell sites.

== Overview ==
A cellular network is a network of handheld mobile phones (cell phones) in which each phone communicates with the telephone network by radio waves through a local antenna at a cellular base station (cell site). The coverage area in which service is provided is divided into a mosaic of small geographical areas called &quot;cells&quot;, each served by a separate low power multichannel transceiver and antenna at a base station. All the cell phones within a cell communicate with the system through that cell&#x27;s antenna, on separate frequency channels assigned by the base station from a common pool of frequencies used by the system.

The purpose of cellular organization is to conserve radio bandwidth by frequency reuse; the low power radio signals used within each cell do not travel far beyond the cell, so the radio channels can be reused in geographically separated cells. When a mobile user moves from one cell to another, their phone is automatically &quot;handed off&quot; to the new cell&#x27;s antenna, and assigned a new set of frequencies, and subsequently communicates with this antenna. This background handoff process is imperceptible to the user and can occur in the middle of a phone call without any service interruption. Each cell phone has an automated full duplex digital transceiver and communicates with the cell antenna over two digital radio channels in the UHF or microwave band, one for each direction of the bidirectional conversation, plus a control channel which handles registering the phone with the network, dialing, and the handoff process.

Typically a cell tower is located at the edge of one or more cells and covers multiple cells using directional antennas. A common geometry is to locate the cell site at the intersection of three adjacent cells, with three antennas at 120° angles each covering one cell. The type of antenna used for cellular base stations &quot;(vertical white rectangles in pictures)&quot;, called a sector antenna, usually consists of a vertical collinear array of dipoles. It has a flat fan-shaped radiation pattern, which is tilted slightly down to cover the cell area without radiating at higher angles into further off cells which reuse the same frequencies. The elevation angle of the antenna must be carefully adjusted, so the beam covers the entire cell without radiating too far. In modern sector antennas beam tilt can usually be adjusted electronically, to avoid the necessity of a lineman climbing the tower to mechanically tilt the antenna when adjustment is needed.

== Operation ==

=== Range ===

The working range of a cell site (the range which mobile devices connects reliably to the cell site) is not a fixed figure. It will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: 
* Height of antenna over surrounding terrain (Line-of-sight propagation).
* The frequency of signal in use.
* The transmitter&#x27;s rated power.
* The required uplink/downlink data rate of the subscriber&#x27;s device
* The directional characteristics of the site antenna array.
* Reflection and absorption of radio energy by buildings or vegetation.
* It may also be limited by local geographical or regulatory factors and weather conditions.
* In addition there are timing limitations in some technologies (e.g., even in free space, GSM would be limited to 150 km, with 180 km being possible with special equipment)

Generally, in areas where there are enough cell sites to cover a wide area, the range of each one will be set to:
* Ensure there is enough overlap for &quot;handover&quot; to/from other sites (moving the signal for a mobile device from one cell site to another, for those technologies that can handle it - e.g. making a GSM phone call while in a car or train).
* Ensure that the overlap area is not too large, to minimize interference problems with other sites.

In practice, cell sites are grouped in areas of high population density, with the most potential users. Cell phone traffic through a single site is limited by the base station&#x27;s capacity; of -56 dBm signal there is a finite number of calls or data traffic that a base station can handle at once. This capacity limitation is commonly the factor that determines the spacing of cell mast sites. In suburban areas, masts are commonly spaced apart and in dense urban areas, masts may be as close as 400–800 m apart.

The &quot;maximum&quot; range of a mast (where it is not limited by interference with other masts nearby) depends on the same considerations. In any case the limiting factor is the ability of a low-powered personal cell phone to transmit back to the mast. As a rough guide, based on a tall mast and flat terrain, it may be possible to get between . When the terrain is hilly, the maximum distance can vary from as little as due to encroachment of intermediate objects into the wide center Fresnel zone of the signal. Depending on terrain and other circumstances, a GSM Tower can replace between of cabling for fixed wireless networks. In addition, some technologies, such as GSM, have an additional absolute maximum range of , which is imposed by technical limitations. CDMA and IDEN have no such limit defined by timing.

==== Practical example of range ====
* 3G/4G/5G (FR1) Mobile base station tower: it is technically possible to cover up to 50–150 km. (Macrocell)
* 5G (FR2) Mobile base station: the distances between the 5G base-station is about 250–300 m, due to the use of millimetre waves.

=== Channel reuse ===
The concept of &quot;maximum&quot; range is misleading in a cellular network. Cellular networks are designed to support many conversations with a limited number of radio channels (slices of radio frequency spectrum necessary to make one conversation) that are licensed to an operator of a cellular service. To overcome this limitation, it is necessary to repeat and reuse the same channels at different locations. Just as a car radio changes from one local station to a completely different local station with the same frequency when traveling to another city, the same radio channel gets reused on a cell mast only a few miles away. To do this, the signal of a cell mast is intentionally kept at low power and in many cases tilted downward to limit its reach. This allows covering an area small enough not to have to support more conversations than the available channels can carry. Due to the sectorized arrangement of antennas on a tower, it is possible to vary the strength and angle for each sector depending on the coverage from other towers in the area.

=== Signal limiting factor ===
A cell phone may not work at times because it is too far from a mast, or because the phone is in a location where cell phone signals are attenuated by thick building walls, hills, or other structures. The signals do not need a clear line of sight but greater radio interference will degrade or eliminate reception. When many people try to use the cell mast at the same time, e.g. during a traffic jam or a sports event, then there will be a signal on the phone display but it is blocked from starting a new connection. The other limiting factor for cell phones is the ability to send a signal from its low powered battery to the cell site. Some cell phones perform better than others under low power or low battery, typically due to the ability to send a good signal from the phone to the mast.

The base station controller (a central computer that specializes in making phone connections) and the intelligence of the cell phone keeps track of and allows the phone to switch from one mast to the next during conversation. As the user moves towards a mast it picks the strongest signal and releases the mast from which the signal has become weaker; that channel on that mast becomes available to another user.
===Geolocation===

Cellular geolocation is less precise than by GNSS (e.g. GPS), but it is available to devices that do not have GPS receivers and where the GNSS is not available. The precision of this system varies and is highest where advanced forward link methods are possible and is lowest where only a single cell site can be reached, in which case the location is only known to be within the coverage of that site.

An advanced forward link is where a device is within range of at least three cell sites and where the carrier has implemented timing system use.

Another method is using angle of arrival (AoA) and it occurs when the device is in range of at least two cell sites, produces intermediate precision. Assisted GPS uses both satellite and cell phone signals.

In the United States, for emergency calling service using location data (locally called &quot;Enhanced 911&quot;), it was required that at least 95% of cellular phones in use on 31 December 2005 support such service. Many carriers missed this deadline and were fined by the Federal Communications Commission.

=== Radio power and health ===

According to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission: &quot;Measurement data obtained from various sources have consistently indicated that &#x27;worst-case&#x27; ground-level power densities near typical cellular towers are on the order of 1 μW/cm2 (or 10 mW/m2) or less (usually significantly less).&quot;

Cell phones, cell towers, wi-fi, smart meters, digital enhanced cordless telecommunications phones, cordless phones, baby monitors, and other wireless devices all emit non-ionizing radio frequencies, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified as a &quot;potential&quot; carcinogen, According to the U.S. National Cancer Institute, &quot;No mechanism by which ELF-EMFs or radiofrequency radiation could cause cancer has been identified.&quot;

According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, &quot;Scientific consensus shows that non-ionizing radiation is not a carcinogen and, at or below the radio frequency exposure limits set by the FCC, non-ionizing radiation has not been shown to cause any harm to people.&quot;

== Temporary sites ==

Although cell antennas are normally attached to permanent structures, carriers also maintain fleets of vehicles, called cells-on-wheels (COWs), that serve as temporary cell sites. A generator may be included for use where network electrical power is not available, and the system may have a wireless backhaul link allowing use where a wired link is not available.

COWs are also used at permanent cell sites—as temporary replacements for damaged equipment, during planned outages, and to augment capacity such as during conventions.

==Employment==
Cell site workers are called tower climbers or transmission tower workers. Transmission tower workers often work at heights of up to , performing installation, maintenance and repair work for cellular phone and other wireless communications companies.

==Spy agency setup==
According to documents leaked to , the NSA sells a $40,000 &quot;active GSM base station&quot; to be used as a tool to mimic a mobile phone tower and thus monitor cell phones.

In November 2014, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that the Technical Operations Group of the U.S. Marshals utilizes spy devices, known as &quot;dirtboxes&quot;, to mimic powerful cell tower signals. Such devices are designed to cause mobile phones to switch over to the tower, as it is the strongest signal within reach. The devices are placed on airplanes to effectively create a &quot;dragnet&quot;, gathering data about phones as the planes travel above populated areas.

== Off-grid systems ==

An off-grid cell site is not connected to the public electrical grid. Usually the system is off-the-grid because of difficult access or lack of infrastructure. Fuel cell or other backup power systems are added to critical cell sites to provide day-to-day and emergency power. Traditionally, sites have used internal-combustion-engine-driven generator sets, however, being less efficient than public power, they increase operating expense and are a source of pollution (atmospheric, acoustic, etc.) and some are in areas protected by environment and landscape conservation.

Renewable sources, such as solar power and wind power may be available where cell sites are placed. The first off-grid mast in the UK was installed in 2022 in Eglwyswrw, Wales. This can reduce the cost of fuel to the cell site or telecom tower by up to 75%. They can be backed up by a fuel generator system which allows the cell site to work when the renewable sources are not enough. One such energy production system consists of:
* Solar power generator
* Wind generator
* Electrochemical generator fuel cells

Electrical energy from intermittent sources is stored in secondary batteries which are usually designed to have an average of two days of self-sufficiency, also known as autonomy, to allow time for maintenance personnel to arrive at site when a repair is needed.

The renewable energy systems supply electrical power when available. The fuel cells are activated only when the natural sources are not enough to supply the energy the system needs. The emergency power supply (the fuel cells) is designed to last an average of ten days. In this way the structure is completely self-sufficient: this enables the maintenance team to pay only few visits to the site, since it is usually hard to get to.

==Camouflage==
There is often local opposition to new masts for reasons of safety and appearance. The latter is sometimes tackled by disguising the mast as something else, such as a flag pole, street lamp, or a tree (e.g. palm trees, pine trees, cypress) or rooftop structures or urban features such as chimneys or panels.

These concealed cell sites can distinguish themselves by foliage shape and bark type. The foliage of all these antennas is composed of leaves made of plastic material accurately designed, taking into consideration quantity, shape and array suitable to completely conceal the antennas and all accessory parts in a natural manner. The materials used guarantee absolute radio-electric transparency and resistance to UVA rays. Nicknames include &quot;monopalm&quot; for a monopole disguised as a palm tree or &quot;Pseudopinus telephoneyensis&quot; for a mast disguised as a pine tree. In monopoles, the directional antennas are sometimes hidden in a plastic housing near the top of the pole so that the crossbars can be eliminated.

Rooftop structures such as concealment chimneys or panels, 6 to 12 meters high, may conceal one or more mobile telephone operators on the same station. Roofmask panels can be fixed to existing rooftop structures, restyling them quickly and cheaply.

==Miniature==
Researchers at Alcatel-Lucent have developed a cell site called lightRadio that fits in the palm of hand. It is the size of a Rubik&#x27;s cube. It is capable of relaying 2G, 3G and 4G signals. They are more energy efficient and deliver broadband more efficiently than current cell sites. They could be used in very populated urban areas to make room for more radio space.

==Water tower cellular==

Cellular companies sign leases with local governments to place cellular antennas on water towers.

<text>Capturing the Friedmans is a 2003 HBO documentary film directed by Andrew Jarecki. It focuses on the 1980s investigation of Arnold and Jesse Friedman for child molestation. The film premiered at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival where it received critical acclaim as well as the Grand Jury Prize: Documentary. The film went on to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.

==Production==
Jarecki initially was making a short film, &quot;Just a Clown&quot; (which he later completed), about children&#x27;s birthday party entertainers in New York City, including the popular clown David Friedman (&quot;Silly Billy&quot;). During his research, Jarecki learned that David Friedman&#x27;s brother, Jesse, and his father, Arnold, had pleaded guilty to child sexual abuse, and the family had an archive of home movies. Jarecki interviewed some of the children involved and ended up making a film focusing on the Friedmans.

==Synopsis==
The investigation into Arnold Friedman&#x27;s life started in 1984, when the U.S. Postal Service intercepted a magazine of child pornography sent to him from the Netherlands. In 1987, investigators searched his home in Great Neck, New York, and found a collection of child pornography. Upon learning that Arnold taught computer classes for preteen boys in his home, authorities interviewed the students, some of whom alleged they had been subjected to physical and sexual abuse at the hands of Arnold and his youngest son, Jesse, a young adult who assisted Arnold with the classes. The two men were arrested and accused of committing hundreds of crimes, throwing the community into turmoil. They were eventually able to get out on bail and returned home to prepare for court, hanging their hopes for acquittal on the lack of physical evidence against them and reports of the coercive tactics and leading questions that had been used to question the students.

Around this time, David, Arnold&#x27;s eldest son, got a camcorder, and he recorded hours of home videos during this period. The videos were not made with the intention of showing them to the public, but the film incorporates some of this footage, which consists of family dinners, conversations, and arguments. While Arnold&#x27;s three sons (Seth, the middle son, chose to not participate in the documentary) believed Arnold and Jesse were innocent, Elaine, Arnold&#x27;s wife and the mother of the boys, was unsure of her husband&#x27;s innocence, and she encouraged Arnold to confess, hoping that would somehow help Jesse&#x27;s case. Arnold did plead guilty to multiple charges of sodomy and sexual abuse and was sentenced to prison. Jesse later also pled guilty; his charges were not reduced after his father&#x27;s plea, but he said his father had molested him as a child to try to get a less severe sentence (Jesse has since stated that this was just a legal ploy.)

After their pleas, both Arnold and Jesse said that no abuse had taken place during the computer classes, but they thought, given the media coverage of the case and the climate in Great Neck at the time, they would have been convicted and given harsher sentences if they had gone to trial. However, in a document Arnold wrote while under house arrest after he was bailed out of jail, he did claim that, when he was 13, he sexually abused his younger brother, Howard, who was eight years old at the time (Howard is interviewed in the film and says he does not remember being abused by his brother), and admitted to, as an adult, molesting two boys who were not his students (Jesse&#x27;s lawyer, Peter Panaro, who visited Arnold in a Wisconsin federal prison, is interviewed in the film and says Arnold admitted this to him as well). Jesse, in a statement subsequent to the film, said his father also told him and his brothers that he sexually abused Howard.

Arnold Friedman died in prison in 1995 after taking an overdose of antidepressants, leaving a $250,000 life insurance benefit to Jesse. Jesse Friedman was released from New York&#x27;s Clinton Correctional Facility in 2001 after serving 13 years of his sentence. As of 2013, he was running an online book-selling business.

==Reception==
=== Critical response === 
&quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot; won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival and received predominantly positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 97% based on 153 reviews, with an average rating of 8.46/10; the website&#x27;s critical consensus calls the film: &quot;A haunting depiction of a disintegrating family, and a powerful argument on the elusiveness of truth&quot;. The film was ranked as the 7th best-reviewed movie of 2003 on the website&#x27;s best of the year list. On Metacritic, it has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The low-budget documentary was a success with audiences as well, its $3 million theatrical gross making it a surprise hit.

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Jarecki so recognizes the archetypal figures in the Friedman home that he knows to push things any further through heavy-handed assessment would be redundant.&quot; He praised Jarecki for operating under the premise &quot;that first impressions can&#x27;t be trusted and that truth rests with each person telling the story.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Desson Howe offered similar praise, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s testament to Jarecki&#x27;s superbly wrought film that everyone seems to be, simultaneously, morally suspect and strikingly innocent as they relate their stories and assertions ... This is a film about the quagmire of mystery in every human soul.&quot; Similarly, film critic Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The film is an instructive lesson about the elusiveness of facts, especially in a legal context. Sometimes guilt and innocence are discovered in court, but sometimes, we gather, only truths about the law are demonstrated.&quot; The film was voted the fifth film in the 2005 Channel 4 programme &quot;The 50 Greatest Documentaries&quot;.

In one of the few negative reviews, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Kenneth Turan wrote a critique of both the film and Jarecki, stating: &quot;Jarecki&#x27;s pose of impartiality gets especially troublesome for audiences when it enables him to evade responsibility for dealing with the complexities of his material.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Debbie Nathan, who was hired by Jarecki as a consultant after having been interviewed for the film, said of Jarecki, &quot;Polling viewers at Sundance in January, he was struck by how they were split over Arnold and Jesse&#x27;s guilt. Since then, he&#x27;s crafted a marketing strategy based on ambiguity, and during Q&amp;As and interviews, he has studiously avoided taking a stand.&quot;

In his review, Ebert recounted Jarecki&#x27;s statement at the Sundance Film Festival that he did not know whether Arnold and Jesse Friedman were guilty of child molestation and roundly praised Jarecki for communicating this ambiguity. Jarecki funded Jesse Friedman&#x27;s appeal and in 2014 he renewed his defense saying, &quot;At the time, &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot; was celebrated for its ambiguity, but if you look at the prosecution of this case, it was an unambiguous disaster... If the police and the DA hadn&#x27;t bullied everyone, it never would have gotten to this place. I care a lot about this issue of child abuse, I take it very seriously. That&#x27;s why I feel so strongly that when there are false claims about these kinds of crimes, they really undermine the entire system.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
Criticism intensified as Jarecki&#x27;s choice not to pursue his firm belief in the Friedmans&#x27; innocence became publicly known. There was also a critical backlash due to footage Jarecki left out on purpose. The film omitted a third defendant in the case, Ross Goldstein, a teenage neighbor who turned state&#x27;s evidence and corroborated some of the children&#x27;s accusations. Additionally, Jarecki omitted a tearful confession of guilt Jesse Friedman made from prison on Geraldo Rivera&#x27;s talk show in 1989; during the interview, he also detailed how his father had molested him as a child. Some of the Friedmans&#x27; alleged victims and family members wrote to the Awards Committee, protesting the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature nomination.

=== Accolades ===
==Additional materials==
The 2003 DVD release of the film included a second DVD: &quot;Capturing the Friedmans -- Outside the Frame&quot;. It included:
* additional home-video footage shot by the Friedmans
* numerous deleted and extended scenes from the film
* footage from Q&amp;A sessions following screenings of the film
* updates on Jesse&#x27;s life after he was released from prison
* &quot;Just a Clown&quot;, Jarecki&#x27;s 20-minute short documentary featuring David Friedman that led to &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot;
* A ROM section with several documents from the family and the case

There was footage on the bonus disc of an altercation that occurred during a Q&amp;A session following the film&#x27;s screening at the Tribeca Film Festival, in which Frances Galasso, the retired head of the Nassau County Police&#x27;s Sex Crimes Unit, argues with investigative journalist Debbie Nathan, as well as a speech by trial judge Abbey Boklan from the film&#x27;s premiere in Great Neck. Both Galasso and Boklan claim the film excluded evidence that points to Jesse&#x27;s guilt, such as his interview with Geraldo Rivera and the existence of Ross Goldstein, the third defendant, who served time in prison after pleading guilty to charges of child molestation and even named two additional co-conspirators, though they remained unindicted. (Goldstein is not named in the film, but it is said in one of the DVD extras that he declined to be interviewed. One of the unindicted co-conspirators claims in the same section that he and the fifth man were falsely accused by Goldstein.) During the Tribeca Q&amp;A, Jesse&#x27;s lawyer at the time of the case, Peter Panaro, said he advised Jesse not to appear on Rivera&#x27;s talk show (Panaro was also present on the show), and even had Jesse sign an affidavit saying he was doing so against legal advice.

==Subsequent legal developments==
In August 2010, a federal appeals court upheld the conviction of Jesse Friedman on technical legal grounds, but took the unusual step of urging prosecutors to reopen Friedman&#x27;s case, saying that there was a &quot;reasonable likelihood that Jesse Friedman was wrongfully convicted&quot;. The decision cited &quot;overzealousness&quot; by law enforcement officials swept up in the hysteria over child molestation in the 1980s.

Following the appeals court ruling, the Nassau District Attorney&#x27;s office began a three-year investigation led by District Attorney Kathleen M. Rice. On June 24, 2013, the report was released. In a 155-page report, the district attorney&#x27;s office concluded that none of four issues raised in a strongly-worded 2010 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was substantiated by the evidence. Instead, it concluded, &quot;By any impartial analysis, the reinvestigation process prompted by Jesse Friedman, his advocates and the Second Circuit, has only increased confidence in the integrity of Jesse Friedman&#x27;s guilty plea and adjudication as a sex offender.&quot; Jesse Friedman was regarded as a &quot;narcissist&quot; and a &quot;psychopathic deviant&quot; by a psychiatrist his attorney hired to conduct an evaluation. Judge Boklan was said to have been subject to &quot;selectively edited and misleading film portrayals in &quot;Capturing the Friedmans&quot;&quot;.

The work was guided and overseen by a four-member independent advisory panel, which included Barry Scheck, a founder of the Innocence Project, one of the country&#x27;s leading advocates for overturning wrongful convictions, and a member of O. J. Simpson&#x27;s defense team. However, Scheck has subsequently complained that key documents were not available to the panel, and urged the matter be reopened.

Prior to the report&#x27;s release, new details emerged, including letters and affidavits from some of the alleged victims in which they recanted their accusations and implicated the police in coercing their statements.

&quot;The Village Voice&quot; conducted an interview with Jesse Friedman, who described himself as &quot;freakishly optimistic&quot;, and also reported that Ross Goldstein, a childhood friend of his, had broken his 25 year silence to explain he had been coerced into cooperating with the district attorney&#x27;s office: &quot;He told the review panel of how he&#x27;d been coerced into lying, how prosecutors coached him through details of the Friedmans&#x27; computer lab, which he&#x27;d never even seen, and how he was imprisoned for something he&#x27;d never done.&quot;

On February 10, 2015, Jesse Friedman was back in state appellate court seeking to have Nassau County prosecutors turn over to him the remainder of their evidence against him. That December, a state Appeals Court found that the prosecutors did not have to release the records. Because Friedman pled guilty and there was no trial, a spokesperson for the Nassau County District Attorney claimed the records of witnesses who did not testify are confidential, and the law does not mandate their disclosure. However, on November 27, 2017, the NYS Court of Appeals reversed the lower court, and overturned the DA&#x27;s claim regarding &quot;confidential witnesses&quot;, and ordered the lower court to oversee disclosure of Friedman case files to the defendant.

<text>Banausos (Ancient Greek , plural , &quot;banausoi&quot;) is a pejorative applied to the class of manual laborers or artisans in Ancient Greece. The related abstract noun – &quot;banausia&quot; is defined by Hesychius as &quot;every craft () [conducted] by means of fire&quot;, reflecting the folk etymology of the word as coming from (&quot;baunos&quot;) &quot;furnace&quot; and (&quot;auō&quot;) &quot;to dry&quot;. The actual etymology of the words is unknown; they are not attested outside Attic-Ionic or before the 5th century BC. The epic heroes call their smiths – &quot;dēmiourgoi&quot;.

&quot;Banausos&quot; (or rather – &quot;banausikos&quot;) has also been adapted into English, as the rare word banausic, both as a term of abuse, and to represent Greek usage. According to Dagobert D. Runes&#x27; &quot;Dictionary of Philosophy&quot;, it means &quot;vulgar and illiberal&quot;, particularly when referring to arts or occupations that &quot;deform the body or the mind.&quot; Its use in English is not found before 1845, with the Victorian revival of classical learning.

One of the contributions of classical philology to the Kultur-movement in Wilhelmine and post-Wilhelmine Germany was the use of &quot;banausisch&quot; as an insult — along with the myths that the German Soul is essentially Greek, that the ancient Greeks were blond, and that the modern Greeks are not descended from them. Today in German &quot;Banause&quot; is used to mean an uncouth person indifferent to high culture, like English philistine.

Such ideas have been regularly challenged since World War II, but they were occasionally reflected in the English-speaking world of the time. For example, Edith Hamilton accepted them as the best scholarship of her school days. Again, a junior colleague of Sir Gilbert Murray permitted himself (in 1935) the following, which goes well beyond Greek usage:

:The aim of a journalist may either be to enlarge the circulation of a paper or to give his readers a true and intelligent picture of the world; of a lawyer either to extend his practice or to help justice be done; of a business man either to grow rich or to play his part as a &#x27;nurse&#x27; of the community. These alternatives are not exclusive. But where the former predominates, the amount of arete generated will be small, and journalists, lawyers and industrialists will be banausoi rather than men.

<text>Franklin Township is one of the nine townships of Marion County, Indiana, United States. Located in the southeast corner of the county, it has been subsumed into the city of Indianapolis along with most of the rest of the county. It contains the communities of Acton, Wanamaker, and the eastern portion of the excluded city of Beech Grove.

Franklin Township was organized in the 1820s. Franklin Township is one of the last areas in Marion County to see heavy suburban land development from the outward expansion of Indianapolis. This is primarily because of a history of family farms in the area, but is also due to various civic efforts to maintain a rural atmosphere in the area over time.

The population of the township as of the 2020 census was 65,788 up from 32,080 in 2000. The twofold increase in population ranks Franklin Township as the fastest growing of Marion County&#x27;s nine townships during that timeframe.

The township has a median income of $70,000.

==Education==
Franklin Township Community School Corporation is the public school district that serves all of Franklin Township. The area high school is Franklin Central High School.

In recent years, Franklin Township has seen a population explosion leading to a heavy reliance on residential property taxes in particular for funding of the Franklin Township Community Schools. Also, as the Indiana Property Tax caps have been phased in from 2008 to 2011, revenue for the schools in the township has dropped more than 19.8%. After two referendums failed to close the $13 million gap in school funding, the school board proposed cuts to close the gap, including cutting teachers and halting most student busing. The shortfall is larger in Franklin Township because of the demographics being extensively residential, while the tax burden with the aforementioned property tax caps has shifted more to farms and businesses which now have a capped rate of 2% and 3% respectively.

In 2012, the Franklin Township School Corporation was able to again offer student bussing without additional fees by restructuring its debt.

<text>Eric Gustaf Ericson (26 October 1918 – 16 February 2013) was a Swedish choral conductor and influential choral teacher.

==Life and career==
He graduated from the Royal College of Music (&quot;Kungl. Musikhögskolan&quot;) in Stockholm in 1943 and went on to complete his studies abroad, at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, Switzerland, and in Germany, Great Britain, and the United States.

Renowned for his innovative teaching methods and the wide-ranging nature of his repertoire, Ericson was the principal conductor of the Orphei Drängar choir at Uppsala University from 1951 until 1991, and choirmaster until 1982 of the Swedish Radio Choir which was established on his initiative in 1951. Also in 1951, he began his teaching career at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm, where he became a legendary and inspirational figure, and he was appointed to the chair of choral conducting there in 1968.
In 1983 Ericson received an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Humanities at Uppsala University, Sweden.

He won the Nordic Council Music Prize in 1995, and in 1997 Ericson shared the Polar Music Prize with Bruce Springsteen: the citation was for &quot;pioneering achievements as a conductor, teacher, artistic originator and inspirer in Swedish and international choral music&quot;. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1998, Swedbank of Sweden endowed an &quot;Eric Ericson Chair in Choral Directing&quot; at Uppsala University.

He founded the Eric Ericson Chamber Choir, and worked as a guest conductor for many ensembles and choirs including Drottningholm Baroque Ensemble (Bach&#x27;s Passions), Netherlands Chamber Choir (Poulenc), Chœur de chambre Accentus, Paris (Finnish works).

His conducting for the 1975 Bergman film &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; was described as &quot;impressive&quot; in its balance of &quot;levity and solemnity&quot;, and the reviewer noted that Ericson was &quot;a Mozartian to be reckoned with&quot;.

==Awards==
*Litteris et Artibus (1968)
*Léonie Sonning Music Prize (1991; Denmark)
*Nordic Council Music Prize (1995, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland)
*Polar Music Prize (1997, Sweden)

<doc id="598358" wikidata="Q306945" url="?curid=598358" title="Eastern Continental Divide">
<text>The Eastern Continental Divide, Eastern Divide or Appalachian Divide is a hydrological divide in eastern North America that separates the easterly Atlantic Seaboard watershed from the westerly Gulf of Mexico watershed. It is one of six continental hydrological divides of North America which define several drainage basins, each of which drains to a particular body of water.

The divide nearly spans the United States from south of Lake Ontario through the Florida peninsula, and consists of raised terrain including the Appalachian Mountains to the north, the southern Piedmont Plateau and lowland ridges in the Atlantic Coastal Plain to the south.

==Course==

=== Northern portion ===


The divide&#x27;s northern portion winds through the middle of the Appalachian Mountains, either through the interior of the Allegheny Plateau or along the Allegheny Mountains. In this portion, the western drainage of the divide flows into the watersheds of the Allegheny River, Monongahela River, and New River, all tributaries of the Ohio River. The eastern drainage flows into the watersheds of the Susquehanna River, Potomac River, and James River, all of which flow into Chesapeake Bay before entering the Atlantic Ocean.

At its northern terminus, the Eastern Continental Divide originates at Triple Divide Peak in Ulysses Township, Pennsylvania, about south of the New York-Pennsylvania border, where it diverges from the St. Lawrence Divide. This point divides the eastern United States into three watersheds: those of the Genesee River flowing into Lake Ontario and then the St. Lawrence River to the north; Pine Creek into the Susquehanna River as part of the Atlantic seaboard watershed to the east; and the Allegheny River into the Ohio, the Mississippi, and the Gulf of Mexico to the west.

From north to south, the divide passes through the broader Allegheny Plateau region, following the boundary between the Allegheny River and Susquehanna River watersheds through most of Pennsylvania. At Blue Knob near Altoona, the Divide begins to follow Allegheny Mountain and then Little Savage Mountain. A few miles before the state border, the Divide begins to separate the Youghiogheny River and Potomac River watersheds.

In Maryland, the Divide runs significantly west of the Allegheny Front, following Backbone Mountain, and passing near the source of the North Branch Potomac River at the Fairfax Stone. The Divide then passes through a plateau of the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia, passing between the north end of the Canaan Valley in the Cheat River watershed, and the Mount Storm Lake basin in the Potomac River watershed. The Divide then rejoins the Allegheny Front.

A significant portion of the Divide forms part of the border between West Virginia and Virginia along Allegheny Mountain and then Peters Mountain, separating the Greenbrier River and James River watersheds. It then makes a dramatic arc to the east around the Sinking Creek valley, and then follows the hill crest east of Blacksburg, Virginia.

=== Central portion ===
The divide&#x27;s central portion generally follows the easternmost ridge of the Blue Ridge Mountains and thus of the Appalachian Mountains as a whole, which takes the form of a high escarpment. In this portion, the western drainage of the divide flows into the watersheds of the New River and Tennessee River, both tributaries of the Ohio River. The eastern drainage flows into the watersheds of the Roanoke River, Pee Dee River, and Santee River.

The divide initially separates the headwaters of the New River from that of the Roanoke River. Just before the Divide passes into North Carolina, it begins to separate the New River and Yadkin River watersheds. It then separates upper tributaries of the Tennessee River from those of the Santee River. Its high point is on Grandfather Mountain at 5,946 feet (1,812 m); although Mount Mitchell is the highest point in the Appalachian Mountains, it is not on the Divide, but 4 miles west of it.

=== Southern portion ===
Past the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains, the divide&#x27;s southern portion winds through the lowlands of Georgia and Florida. In this portion, the western drainage of the divide flows into the watersheds of the Apalachicola River, Suwannee River, Withlacoochee River, and Peace River, all of which drain directly to the Gulf of Mexico without reaching the Ohio River first. The eastern drainage flows into the watersheds of the Savannah River, Altamaha River, Satilla River, St. Marys River, and St. Johns River.

In Georgia, the Divide generally separates the Apalachicola River, watershed in the west from the Savannah River and Altamaha River watersheds to the east, passing through the Atlanta metropolitan area and extending past the southern end of the Appalachian Mountains southeasterly across the Georgia plateau. In southern Georgia, it separates the Suwannee River and Satilla River watersheds.

In Florida, the Divide generally follows the western edge of the St. Marys River and then St. Johns River, meandering into the low country of Northern Florida until it reaches Central Florida. The west side of the divide continues to be the Suwannee River and then the Withlacoochee River watersheds.

The southern terminus of the Eastern Continental Divide is at the triple divide between the St. Johns, Peace, and Kissimmee River watersheds, which is in Haines City, Florida on the Lake Wales Ridge. Because the Kissimmee River flows into Lake Okeechobee, whose distributaries reach both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean via low swampland covered by a network of diverging canals and natural waterways, its watershed&#x27;s land is not clearly divisible between the two watersheds.

==Weather==
Because the divide is at or in proximity to the highest terrain, air is forced upwards regardless of wind direction. This process of orographic enhancement leads to higher precipitation than surrounding areas. In winter, the divide is often much snowier than surrounding areas, due to orographic enhancement and cooler temperatures with elevation. 

==History==
Prior to about 1760, north of Spanish Florida, the Appalachian Divide represented the boundary between British and French colonial possessions in North America. 

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 separated settled lands of the Thirteen Colonies from lands north and west of it designated the Indian Reserve; the proclamation border ran along the Appalachian Divide but extended beyond its Pennsylvania-New York terminus north into New England.

The exact route of the ECD shifts over time due to erosion, tectonic activity, construction projects, and other factors.

<text>Elliot Aronson (born January 9, 1932) is an American psychologist who has carried out experiments on the theory of cognitive dissonance and invented the Jigsaw Classroom, a cooperative teaching technique that facilitates learning while reducing interethnic hostility and prejudice. In his 1972 social psychology textbook, &quot;The Social Animal&quot;, he stated Aronson&#x27;s First Law: &quot;People who do crazy things are not necessarily crazy&quot;, thus asserting the importance of situational factors in bizarre behavior. He is the only person in the 120-year history of the American Psychological Association to have won all three of its major awards: for writing, for teaching, and for research. In 2007, he received the William James Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Association for Psychological Science, in which he was cited as the scientist who &quot;fundamentally changed the way we look at everyday life&quot;. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Aronson as the 78th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. He officially retired in 1994 but continues to teach and write.

==Early life and education==
Aronson grew up in extreme poverty in Revere, Massachusetts, during the Great Depression. His was the only Jewish family in the neighborhood, and it was not rare for Aronson to be bullied on the way home from Hebrew school by anti-Semitic gangs. He believes that every life&#x27;s progress is based on a combination of luck, opportunity, talent, and intuition. Although his high school grades were mediocre, his SAT scores were high enough to earn him a work-study scholarship at Brandeis University.

Influenced by his father, he began his college career majoring in economics. However, he promptly changed his major to psychology after accidentally wandering into an Introductory Psychology lecture taught by Abraham Maslow. After attending this lecture, he realized that there was an entire science devoted to exploring the kinds of questions that had intrigued him as a child. His undergraduate years at Brandeis brought him closer to a number of respected psychologists, but Maslow was his primary mentor and had the biggest impact on his early academic career.
Aronson earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Brandeis in 1954. He went on to earn a master&#x27;s degree from Wesleyan University in 1956, where he worked with David McClelland, and a Ph.D. in psychology from Stanford University in 1959, where his doctoral advisor and mentor was the experimental social psychologist Leon Festinger.

==Professional history==
Aronson has taught at Harvard University, the University of Minnesota, the University of Texas, and the University of California, Santa Cruz. He also served as distinguished visiting professor at Stanford University. He was included in a list of the 100 most influential psychologists of the 20th century published by the &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot;. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and won the William James Award from the Association for Psychological Science for his lifetime achievements. His honors include distinguished research awards from the American Psychological Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. He also won the Gordon Allport Prize for his work on reducing prejudice. In 1981 he was one of five academics awarded &quot;Professor of the Year&quot; by the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education.

==Research topics==
===Cognitive dissonance===
Aronson&#x27;s interests and research have paid particular attention to the theory of cognitive dissonance. Aronson refined the theory, which posits that when attitudes and behaviors are inconsistent (dissonant), psychological discomfort results. This discomfort motivates the person experiencing it to either change the behavior or the attitude so that consonance is restored. In a classic experiment, Aronson demonstrated that people who undergo an embarrassing initiation to gain admission to a group develop more favorable evaluations of the group than people who are admitted after a mild or easy initiation. In Aronson&#x27;s &quot;Theories of Cognitive Consistency&quot; (1973), he states: &quot;Dissonance theory does not rest upon the assumption that man is a rational animal; rather, it suggests that man is a rationalizing animal – that he attempts to appear rational, both to others and to himself.&quot;

===Jigsaw Classroom===
Aronson led the development of a classroom technique for defusing inter-group tension and promoting self-esteem. It was discovered that it is rare for classrooms of students to cooperate towards a common goal.
In 1971 the newly desegregated schools of Austin, Texas faced a crisis of violence between ethnic groups.
Aronson, then at the University of Texas, was called in as a consultant by a school administrator who was also a former student.
Aronson noticed that the schools&#x27; highly competitive atmosphere was exacerbating the already tense ethnic rivalry.
Together with his graduate students, he developed a model of teaching practice to encourage a culture of shared goals and mutual support.
In the jigsaw classroom approach, pupils are divided into small groups, mixed by race and by ability, to work co-operatively on a task.
The classroom material—for example a biography of a historical figure—is broken into sections, and one member of each group is responsible for reading each section. Members with the same role from each group gather in &quot;expert groups&quot; to discuss their sections. They then return to their own groups and take turns to present what they have learned. They are then assessed individually on all sections of the material. This division of responsibilities means that students are motivated to listen to each other and each of them experiences a role in which they are valuable to others.

Comparisons with traditional classroom environments showed that the jigsaw classroom has positive effects on academic performance, self-esteem and attitudes towards other ethnic groups.
The technique has since been applied in hundreds of schools across North America. From its initial application at third- to fifth-grade school level, it has been expanded to other educational levels. This success encouraged Aronson to apply his research to other policy issues including energy conservation and the treatment of the elderly.
In the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre, Aronson advocated for jigsaw classrooms as part of an approach to defusing the social divisions underlying school violence.

===Gain–loss theory of attraction===
In 1965, Aronson proposed that interpersonal attraction and liking could be understood in terms of the balance of reward and cost. This implied that contrast—a gain or loss of positive feedback from the other person—has more effect on liking than the absolute level of feedback. An example is how compliments are more meaningful when they come from someone who is usually critical, rather than from a reliable supporter. Another example is that a couple may feel more dedicated to their relationship if they initially disliked each other.

===Pratfall effect===
Aronson published a paper in 1966, where he described an experiment testing the effects of a simple blunder on perceived attraction. The so-called pratfall effect is the tendency for attractiveness to increase or decrease after an individual makes a mistake, depending on the individual&#x27;s perceived competence, or ability to perform well in a general sense.

==Awards and professional recognition==
==Personal life==

Elliot is married to Vera Aronson, whom he met while they were both undergraduate research assistants under Abraham Maslow. Together they have had four children: Hal, Neal, Julie and Joshua, who is himself a social psychologist. In 2000, Aronson was diagnosed with macular degeneration and, by 2003, had lost all of his central vision. To cope with his blindness, Aronson decided to get a guide dog, and applied at Guide Dogs for the Blind in 2010. In January 2011 he began a three-week training session with his new guide dog, Desilu, nicknamed Desi. He graduated from the program on February 12, 2011. He said, &quot;They worked us 14 hours a day, until we were almost as smart as our dogs.&quot;

==Bibliography==
Aronson has written more than twenty books, including textbooks, popularizations and one book of children&#x27;s fiction with his granddaughter Ruth Aronson. In 2010, Psychology Press published a book of essays and scholarly articles by his friends, colleagues, and former students celebrating his influence on their work: &quot;The Scientist and the Humanist: A Festschrift in Honor of Elliot Aronson.&quot;

<doc id="598361" wikidata="Q348961" url="?curid=598361" title="Louis I of Anjou">
<text>Louis I, Duke of Anjou (23 July 1339 – 20 September 1384) was a French prince, the second son of John II of France and Bonne of Bohemia. His career was markedly unsuccessful. Born at the Château de Vincennes, Louis was the first of the Angevin branch of the Valois royal house. His father appointed him Count of Anjou and Count of Maine in 1356, and then raised him to the title Duke of Anjou in 1360 and Duke of Touraine in 1370.

He fought in the Battle of Poitiers (1356), in which his father the king was captured by the English. In 1360, he was one of a group of hostages the French surrendered to the English in exchange for the king. He escaped from England, after which his father felt bound in honour to return to English custody, where he later died.

In 1382, as the adopted son of Joanna I of Naples, he succeeded to the counties of Provence and Forcalquier. He also inherited from her a claim to the kingdoms of Naples and Jerusalem. He was already a veteran of the Hundred Years&#x27; War against the English when he led an army into Italy to claim his Neapolitan inheritance. He died on the march and his claims and titles fell to his son and namesake, Louis II, who succeeded in ruling Naples for a time.

==Hundred Years&#x27; War==
Louis was present at the Battle of Poitiers (1356), in the battalion commanded by his brother Charles, the Dauphin. They hardly fought and the whole group escaped in the middle of the confrontation. Although humiliating, their flight allowed them to avoid capture by the English, who won the battle decisively. King John II and Louis&#x27; younger brother Philip were not so fortunate and were captured by the English, commanded by Edward, the Black Prince. Their ransom and peace conditions between France and England were agreed in the Treaty of Brétigny, signed in 1360. Amongst the complicated items of the treaty was a clause that determined the surrender of 40 high-born hostages as guarantee for the payment of the king&#x27;s ransom. Louis, already Duke of Anjou, was in this group and sailed to England in October 1360. However, France was not in good economic condition and further installments of the debt were delayed. As consequence, Louis was in English custody for much more than the expected six months. He tried to negotiate his freedom in a private negotiation with Edward III of England and, when this failed, decided to escape. On his return to France, he met his father&#x27;s disapproval for his unknightly behavior. John II considered himself dishonored and this, combined with the fact that his ransom payments agreed to in the Treaty of Brétigny were in arrears, caused John to return to captivity in England to redeem his honor.

From 1380 to 1382 Louis served as regent for his nephew, King Charles VI of France.

==King of Naples==

In 1382 Louis left France in the latter year to claim the throne of Naples following the death of Queen Joanna I. She had adopted him to succeed her, as she was childless and did not wish to leave her inheritance to any of her close relatives, whom she considered enemies. He was also able to succeed her as count of Provence and Forcalquier. Despite his coronation at Avignon as King of Naples by Antipope Clement VII, Louis was forced to remain in France and Joan&#x27;s troops were defeated by Charles of Durazzo, her second cousin and previous heir. Joanna was killed in her prison in San Fele in 1382; Louis, with support of the Antipope, France, Bernabò Visconti of Milan and Amadeus VI of Savoy, and using the money he had been able to obtain during the regency, launched an expedition to regain the Kingdom of Naples from Charles.

The expedition, counting to some 40,000 troops, was however unsuccessful. Charles, who counted on the mercenary companies under John Hawkwood for a total of some 14,000 men, was able to divert the French from Naples to other regions of the kingdom and to harass them with guerrilla tactics. Amadeus fell ill and died in Molise on 1 March 1383 and his troops abandoned the field. Louis asked for help from his king nephew in France, who sent him an army under Enguerrand of Coucy. The latter was able to conquer Arezzo and then invade the Kingdom of Naples, but midway was reached by the news that Louis had suddenly died at Bisceglie on 20 September 1384. He soon sold Arezzo to Florence and returned to France.

==Marriage and children==
On 9 July 1360, without the consent of his father, Louis married Marie of Blois, Lady of Guise, daughter of Charles, Duke of Brittany and Joanna of Dreux. They had the following children:
* Marie (1370 – after 1383)
* Louis II of Anjou (1377 – 1417)
*Charles (1380 – 1404, Angers), Prince of Taranto, Count of Roucy, Étampes, and Gien

<text>Joshua Stuart &quot;Josh&quot; Weinstein (born May 21, 1971), known professionally as J. Elvis Weinstein, is an American writer and performer, best known for his roles as Dr. Laurence Erhardt and the original puppeteer and voice for Tom Servo and Gypsy on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

==&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;==

Weinstein was one of the founding writers/performers of the show in 1988 at the age of 17. Weinstein worked on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; during its original appearance on Minneapolis UHF station KTMA-TV from 1988 to 1989, and its first season on Comedy Central (then called the Comedy Channel) from 1989 to 1990. However, a significant age gap existed between him and the other cast members; he was only 17 when he joined the show, having been recruited by Joel Hodgson from his &quot;Creative Stand-Up and Smartology&quot; comedy classes. This ultimately led to Weinstein feeling unhappy with the more professional approach to the show the move to the Comedy Channel demanded and caused him to leave the show.

In an April 2019 episode of Bill Corbett&#x27;s Funhouse podcast, Weinstein elaborated on his experience at Best Brains, claiming that MST3K producer, Jim Mallon, was openly hostile toward him and used the age disparity between him and the rest of the cast as a pretext for paying him significantly less for his work on the show than his cohorts.

In 2018, Weinstein returned to the show, providing guest appearances in two of the twelfth season&#x27;s episodes. He returned again to reprise his roles as Dr. Erhardt and Tom Servo for season 13 in 2022.

==Work after &quot;MST3K&quot;==
After leaving &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, Weinstein became a writer for &quot;The Young Person&#x27;s Guide to Becoming a Rock Star&quot; and &quot;Malcolm and Eddie&quot;; he also served as writer and producer for the NBC dramedy &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;. He changed his professional name from &quot;Josh&quot; to &quot;J. Elvis&quot; to avoid confusion with former &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer Josh Weinstein. He was head writer for NBC&#x27;s late night show &quot;Later with Greg Kinnear&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot;.

Weinstein has an extensive background in stand-up comedy; he has performed over a thousand shows as a stand-up comedian, and has written material for Garry Shandling, Dennis Miller, Roseanne Barr, Louie Anderson and other comedians. He is currently the president of Stinkburger Inc.

He appeared in the 2010 science fiction computer game &quot;DARKSTAR - The Interactive Movie&quot; as Captain Cedrick Stone of the Galactic Discovery II.

Weinstein currently cohosts the weekly podcast &quot;Thought Spiral&quot; with friend and fellow comedian Andy Kindler.

==&quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot;==
On October 30, 2007, Joel Hodgson announced he was starting a new show with the same &quot;riffing on bad movies&quot; premise as &quot;MST3K&quot; called &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot;, together with former &quot;MST3K&quot; cast and crew members Weinstein, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl.

Weinstein toured with &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot; from November 2012 until the show&#x27;s indefinite hiatus in December 2013.

== Personal life ==
Weinstein is married to musician Allison MacLeod.

==Awards==
On July 18, 2015, Weinstein was awarded the Melvyn Douglas “Best in Show” Award at the Macon Film Festival for the film &quot;Michael Des Barres: Who Do You Want Me to Be&quot;, which he directed.

<doc id="598363" wikidata="Q146256" url="?curid=598363" title="Miriam Makeba">
<text>Zenzile Miriam Makeba ( , ; 4 March 1932 – 9 November 2008), nicknamed Mama Africa, was a South African singer, songwriter, actress, and civil rights activist. Associated with musical genres including Afropop, jazz, and world music, she was an advocate against apartheid and white-minority government in South Africa.

Born in Johannesburg to Swazi and Xhosa parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the Manhattan Brothers, and an all-woman group, the Skylarks, performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film &quot;Come Back, Africa&quot;, which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother&#x27;s funeral was prevented by the country&#x27;s government.

Makeba&#x27;s career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being &quot;Pata Pata&quot; (1967). Along with Belafonte, she received a Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording for their 1965 album &quot;An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba&quot;. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the civil rights movement. She married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968, and consequently lost support among white Americans. Her visa was revoked by the US government when she was traveling abroad, forcing her and Carmichael to relocate to Guinea. She continued to perform, mostly in African countries, including at several independence celebrations. She began to write and perform music more explicitly critical of apartheid; the 1977 song &quot;Soweto Blues&quot;, written by her former husband Hugh Masekela, was about the Soweto uprising. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990, Makeba returned to South Africa. She continued recording and performing, including a 1991 album with Nina Simone and Dizzy Gillespie, and appeared in the 1992 film &quot;Sarafina!&quot;. She was named an FAO Goodwill Ambassador in 1999, and campaigned for humanitarian causes. She died of a heart attack during a 2008 concert in Italy.

Makeba was among the first African musicians to receive worldwide recognition. She brought African music to a Western audience, and popularized the world music and Afropop genres. Despite her cosmopolitan background, she was frequently viewed by Western audiences as an embodiment of Africa: she was also seen as a style icon in both South Africa and the West. Makeba made popular several songs critical of apartheid, and became a symbol of opposition to the system, particularly after her right to return was revoked. Upon her death, former South African President Nelson Mandela said that &quot;her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.&quot;

==Early years==
===Childhood and family===
Zenzile Miriam Makeba was born on 4 March 1932 in the black township of Prospect, near Johannesburg, as the only child of her father and the sixth of her mother. Her Xhosa father, Caswell Makeba, was a teacher; he died when she was six years old. Her Swazi mother, Christina Makeba, was a domestic worker; she had previously separated from her first husband and met and married Caswell shortly afterwards. Makeba later said that before she was conceived, her mother had been warned that any future pregnancy could be fatal. Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour and delivery. Miriam&#x27;s grandmother, who attended the birth, often muttered , a Xhosa word that means &quot;you brought this on yourself&quot;, to Miriam&#x27;s mother during her recovery, which inspired her to give her daughter the name &quot;Zenzile&quot;.

When Makeba was eighteen days old, her mother was arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent the first six months of her life in jail. By the time of her mother&#x27;s release from prison, Makeba&#x27;s father, who had been having difficulty finding work as a teacher, had obtained a job as a clerk at the Shell Oil Company in Nelspruit (now Mbombela) and the family moved along with him accordingly. After her father&#x27;s death she moved to the house of her maternal grandmother in Riverside Township outside of Pretoria, along with her siblings and cousins, while her mother worked for white families in Johannesburg to support the family.

As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language.

Makeba was influenced by her family&#x27;s musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of Duke Ellington and Ella Fitzgerald, and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano and sang in a group called The Mississippi 12, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba&#x27;s family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career.

Makeba left school to support her family and first worked as a live-in nanny for a Greek family in the Johannesberg suburb of Waverley for three months. The mother stopped paying her and went to the police to accuse her of stealing, so Makeba fled back to her grandmother&#x27;s home in Riverside. Around that time Makeba&#x27;s mother began the process of becoming a &quot;sangoma&quot; or traditional healer, which required her to go back to her ancestral homeland in Eswatini (then Swaziland). Makeba stayed behind working as a launderer for expatriate workers to support her family.

In 1949, Makeba married James Kubay, a policeman in training, with whom she had her only child, Sibongile &quot;Bongi&quot; Makeba, in 1950. Makeba was then diagnosed with breast cancer, and her husband, who was said to have beaten her, left her shortly afterwards, after a two-year marriage. A decade later she overcame cervical cancer via a hysterectomy.

===Early career===
Makeba began her professional musical career with the Cuban Brothers, a South African all-male close harmony group, with whom she sang covers of popular American songs. Soon afterwards, at the age of 21, she joined a jazz group, the Manhattan Brothers, who sang a mixture of South African songs and pieces from popular African-American groups. Makeba was the only woman in the group. With the Manhattan Brothers she recorded her first hit, &quot;Lakutshn, Ilanga&quot;, in 1953, and developed a national reputation as a musician. In 1956 she joined a new all-woman group, the Skylarks, singing a blend of jazz and traditional South African melodies. Formed by Gallotone Records, the group was also known as the Sunbeams. Makeba sang with the Skylarks when the Manhattan Brothers were travelling abroad; later, she also travelled with the Manhattan Brothers. In the Skylarks, Makeba sang alongside Rhodesian-born musician Dorothy Masuka, whose music Makeba had followed, along with that of Dolly Rathebe. Several of the Skylarks&#x27; pieces from this period became popular; the music historian Rob Allingham later described the group as &quot;real trendsetters, with harmonisation that had never been heard before.&quot; Makeba received no royalties from her work with the Skylarks.

While performing with the Manhattan Brothers in 1955, Makeba met Nelson Mandela, then a young lawyer; he later remembered the meeting, and that he felt that the girl he met &quot;was going to be someone.&quot; With the Manhattan Brothers, Makeba recorded &quot;Lakutshona Ilanga&quot;, written by Mackay Davashe. The song&#x27;s popularity prompted requests for an English version, and in 1956, Gallotone Records released &quot;Lovely Lies&quot;, Makeba&#x27;s first solo success and first recording in English. However, the Xhosa lyric about a man looking for his beloved in jails and hospitals was replaced with the unrelated and innocuous line &quot;You tell such lovely lies with your two lovely eyes&quot; in the English version. The piece became the first South African record to chart on the United States Billboard Top 100. In 1957, Makeba was featured on the cover of &quot;Drum&quot; magazine.

In 1959, Makeba sang the lead female role in the Broadway-inspired South African jazz opera &quot;King Kong&quot;; among those in the cast was the musician Hugh Masekela. The musical was performed to racially integrated audiences, raising her profile among white South Africans. Also in 1959, she had a short guest appearance in &quot;Come Back, Africa&quot;, an anti-apartheid film produced and directed by the American independent filmmaker Lionel Rogosin. Rogosin cast her after seeing her on stage in &quot;African Jazz and Variety&quot; show, on which Makeba was a performer for 18 months. The film blended elements of documentary and fiction and had to be filmed in secret as the government was expected to be hostile to it. Makeba appeared on stage, and sang two songs: her appearance lasted four minutes. The cameo made an enormous impression on viewers, and Rogosin organised a visa for her to attend the premiere of the film at the twenty-fourth Venice Film Festival in Italy, where the film won the prestigious Critics&#x27; Choice Award. Makeba&#x27;s presence has been described as crucial to the film, as an emblem of cosmopolitan black identity that also connected with working-class black people due to the dialogue being in Zulu.

Makeba&#x27;s role in &quot;Come Back, Africa&quot; brought her international recognition and she travelled to London and New York to perform. In London she met the American singer Harry Belafonte, who became her mentor, helping her with her first solo recordings. These included &quot;Pata Pata&quot;, which would be released many years later, and a version of the traditional Xhosa song &quot;Qongqothwane&quot;, which she had first performed with the Skylarks. Though &quot;Pata Pata&quot;—described by &quot;Musician&quot; magazine as a &quot;groundbreaking Afropop gem&quot;—became her most famous song, Makeba described it as &quot;one of my most insignificant songs&quot;. While in England, she married Sonny Pillay, a South African ballad singer of Indian descent; they divorced within a few months.

Makeba then moved to New York, making her US music debut on 1 November 1959 on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; in Los Angeles for a television audience of 60 million. Her New York debut at the Village Vanguard occurred soon after; she sang in Xhosa and Zulu, and performed a Yiddish folk song. Her audience at this concert included Miles Davis and Duke Ellington; her performance received strongly positive reviews from critics. She first came to popular and critical attention in jazz clubs, after which her reputation grew rapidly. Belafonte, who had helped Makeba with her move to the US, handled the logistics for her first performances. When she first moved to the US, Makeba lived in Greenwich Village, along with other musicians and actors. As was common in her profession, she experienced some financial insecurity, and worked as a babysitter for a period.

==Exile==

===United States===
====Breakthrough====
Soon after the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, Makeba learned that her mother had died. When she tried to return home for the funeral, she found that her South African passport had been cancelled. Makeba would remain in exile until 1990. Two of Makeba&#x27;s uncles were killed in the massacre. The incident left her concerned about her family, many of whom were still in South Africa, including her daughter: the nine-year-old Bongi joined her mother in the US in August 1960. During her first few years in the US, Makeba had rarely sung explicitly political music, but her popularity had led to an increase in awareness of apartheid and the anti-apartheid movement. Following the Sharpeville killings, Makeba felt a responsibility to help, as she had been able to leave the country while others had not. From this point, she became an increasingly outspoken critic of apartheid and the white-minority government; before the massacre, she had taken care to avoid overtly political statements in South Africa.

Her musical career in the US continued to flourish. She signed a recording contract with RCA Victor, and released &quot;Miriam Makeba&quot;, her first studio album, in 1960, backed by Belafonte&#x27;s band. RCA Victor chose to buy out Makeba&#x27;s contract with Gallotone Records, and despite the fact that Makeba was unable to perform in South Africa, Gallotone received US$45,000 in the deal, which meant that Makeba received no royalties for her debut album. The album included one of her most famous hits in the US, &quot;Qongqothwane&quot;, which was known in English as &quot;The Click Song&quot; because Makeba&#x27;s audiences could not pronounce the Xhosa name. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called her the &quot;most exciting new singing talent to appear in many years&quot;, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; compared her voice to &quot;the smoky tones and delicate phrasing&quot; of Ella Fitzgerald and the &quot;intimate warmth&quot; of Frank Sinatra. The album was not commercially successful, and Makeba was briefly dropped from RCA Victor: she was re-signed soon after as the label recognised the commercial possibilities of the growing interest in African culture. Her South African identity had been downplayed during her first signing, but it was strongly emphasised the second time to take advantage of this interest. Makeba made several appearances on television, often in the company of Belafonte. In 1962, Makeba and Belafonte sang at the birthday party for US President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, but Makeba did not go to the party afterwards because she was ill. Kennedy nevertheless insisted on meeting her, so Belafonte sent a car to pick her up.

In 1964, Makeba released her second studio album for RCA Victor, &quot;The World of Miriam Makeba&quot;. An early example of world music, the album peaked at number eighty-six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Makeba&#x27;s music had a cross-racial appeal in the US; white Americans were attracted to her image as an &quot;exotic&quot; African performer, and black Americans related their own experiences of racial segregation to Makeba&#x27;s struggle against apartheid. Makeba found company among other African exiles and émigrés in New York, including Hugh Masekela, to whom she was married from 1963 to 1968. During their marriage, Makeba and Masekela were neighbours of the jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie in Englewood, New Jersey; they spent much of their time in Harlem. She also came to know actors Marlon Brando and Lauren Bacall, and musicians Louis Armstrong and Ray Charles. Fellow singer-activist Nina Simone became friendly with Makeba, as did actor Cicely Tyson; Makeba and Simone performed together at Carnegie Hall. Makeba was among black entertainers, activists, and intellectuals in New York at the time who believed that the civil rights movement and popular culture could reinforce each other, creating &quot;a sense of intertwined political and cultural vibrancy&quot;; other examples included Maya Angelou and Sidney Poitier. She later described her difficulty living with racial segregation, saying &quot;There wasn&#x27;t much difference in America; it was a country that had abolished slavery but there was apartheid in its own way.&quot;

====Travel and activism====

Makeba&#x27;s music was also popular in Europe, and she travelled and performed there frequently. Acting on the advice of Belafonte, she added songs from Latin America, Europe, Israel, and elsewhere in Africa to her repertoire. She visited Kenya in 1962 in support of the country&#x27;s independence from British colonial rule, and raised funds for its independence leader Jomo Kenyatta. Later that year she testified before the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid about the effects of the system, asking for economic sanctions against South Africa&#x27;s National Party government. She requested an arms embargo against South Africa, on the basis that weapons sold to the government would likely be used against black women and children. As a result, her music was banned in South Africa, and her South African citizenship and right to return were revoked. Makeba thus became stateless, but she was soon issued passports by Algeria, Guinea, Belgium and Ghana. Throughout her lifetime she held nine passports and was granted honorary citizenship in ten countries.

Soon after her testimony, Haile Selassie, the emperor of Ethiopia, invited her to sing at the inauguration of the Organisation of African Unity; she was the only performer asked to participate. As word spread about her ban from South Africa, she became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; for Western liberals, and her presence in the civil rights movement linked it with the anti-apartheid struggle. In 1964 she was taught the song &quot;Malaika&quot; by a Kenyan student while backstage at a performance in San Francisco; the song later became a staple of her performances.

Throughout the 1960s, Makeba strengthened her involvement with a range of black-centred political movements, including the civil rights, anti-apartheid, Black Consciousness, and Black Power movements. She briefly met the Trinidadian-American activist Stokely Carmichael—the leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and a prominent figure in the Black Panther Party—after Belafonte invited him to one of Makeba&#x27;s concerts; they met again in Conakry six years later. They entered a relationship, initially kept secret from all but their closest friends and family. Makeba participated in fundraising activities for various civil rights groups, including a benefit concert for the 1962 Southern Christian Leadership Conference that civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. referred to as the &quot;event of the year&quot;. Following a concert and rally in Atlanta in support of King, Makeba and others were denied entrance to a restaurant as a result of Jim Crow laws, leading to a televised protest in front of the establishment. She also criticised King&#x27;s Southern Christian Leadership Conference for its investment in South African companies, informing press that &quot;Now my friend of long standing supports the country&#x27;s persecution of my people and I must find a new idol&quot;. Her identity as an African woman in the civil rights movement helped create &quot;an emerging liberal consensus&quot; that extreme racial discrimination, whether domestically or internationally, was harmful. In 1964 she testified at the UN for a second time, quoting a song by Vanessa Redgrave in calling for quick action against the South African government.

Makeba and Belafonte received the Grammy Award for Best Folk Recording for &quot;An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba&quot; on 15 March 1966. The album dealt with the political plight of black South Africans under apartheid, including several songs critical of the South African government, such as &quot;Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd&quot; (&quot;Watch our Verwoerd&quot;, a reference to Hendrik Verwoerd, one of the architects of apartheid). It sold widely and raised Makeba&#x27;s profile in the US; Belafonte and Makeba&#x27;s concert tour following its release was often sold out, and the album has been described as the best they made together. Makeba&#x27;s use of lyrics in Swahili, Xhosa, and Sotho led to her being seen as a representation of an &quot;authentic&quot; Africa by American audiences. In 1967, more than ten years after she first recorded the song, the single &quot;Pata Pata&quot; was released in the US on an album of the same title, and became a worldwide hit. During its recording, she and Belafonte had a disagreement, after which they stopped recording together.

===Guinea===
Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image that alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.

Guinea remained Makeba&#x27;s home for the next 15 years. She and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée, as well as with Kwame Nkrumah, the deposed president of Ghana. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, creating his own record label Syliphone for this purpose, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba recorded for this label, and later stated that &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.&quot; After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government&#x27;s racial policies, recording and singing songs such as &quot;Lumumba&quot; in 1970 (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and &quot;Malcolm X&quot; in 1974.

Makeba performed more frequently in African countries, and as countries became independent of European colonial powers, was invited to sing at independence ceremonies, including in Kenya, Angola, Zambia, Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania), and Mozambique. In September 1974 she performed alongside a multitude of well-known African and American musicians at the Zaire 74 festival in Kinshasa, Zaire (formerly the Congo). She also became a diplomat for Ghana, and was appointed Guinea&#x27;s official delegate to the UN in 1975; that year, she addressed the United Nations General Assembly, where she advocated for South Africa&#x27;s liberation from apartheid. Also in 1975, she visited Mozambique as part of a Guinean delegation to mark Mozambique&#x27;s independence from Portugal. To celebrate the moment, Makeba commissioned the song &quot;Aluta Continua&quot; (The Struggle Continues) from her daughter Bongi and Bill Salter.

She continued to perform in Europe and Asia, along with her African concerts, but not in the US, where a &quot;de facto&quot; boycott was in effect. Her performances in Africa were immensely popular: she was described as the highlight of FESTAC 77, a Pan-African arts festival in Nigeria in 1977, and during a Liberian performance of &quot;Pata Pata&quot;, the stadium proved so loud that she was unable to complete the song. &quot;Pata Pata&quot;, like her other songs, had been banned in South Africa. Another song she sang frequently in this period was &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot;, though she never recorded it. Makeba later stated that it was during this period that she accepted the label &quot;Mama Africa&quot;: scholar Omotayo Jolaosho writes that the epithet, by which she came to be widely known, was first given her by her daughter Bongi in an interview.

In 1976, the South African government replaced English and native South African languages with Afrikaans as the medium of instruction for many subjects in black schools, setting off the Soweto uprising. Between 15,000 and 20,000 students took part; caught unprepared, the police opened fire on the protesting children, killing hundreds and injuring more than a thousand. Hugh Masekela wrote &quot;Soweto Blues&quot; in response to the massacre, and the song was performed by Makeba, becoming a staple of her live performances for many years. A review in the magazine &quot;Musician&quot; said that the song had &quot;searingly righteous lyrics&quot; about the uprising that &quot;cut to the bone&quot;. She had separated from Carmichael in 1973; in 1978 they divorced and in 1981 she married Bageot Bah, an airline executive. Makeba&#x27;s daughter Bongi, and her three children, lived with Makeba for a period. Bongi, who was a singer in her own right, often accompanied her mother on stage, and contributed to her reputation. However, the relationship between the two grew strained after the death of Bongi&#x27;s youngest child.

===Belgium===

Makeba&#x27;s daughter Bongi died in childbirth in 1985. Makeba was left responsible for her two surviving grandchildren, and decided to move out of Guinea, which had become less hospitable to her after Touré&#x27;s death the previous year and the military coup that followed. She settled in the Woluwe-Saint-Lambert district of the Belgian capital Brussels. In the following year, Masekela introduced Makeba to Paul Simon, and a few months later she embarked on Simon&#x27;s very successful Graceland Tour. The tour concluded with two concerts held in Harare, Zimbabwe, which were filmed in 1987 for release as &quot;Graceland: The African Concert&quot;. Makeba fractured her leg while on tour, but continued to perform from a wheelchair. Her involvement with Simon caused controversy: &quot;Graceland&quot; had been recorded in South Africa, breaking the cultural boycott of the country, and thus Makeba&#x27;s participation in the tour was regarded as contravening the boycott (which Makeba herself endorsed). After touring the world with Simon, Warner Bros. Records signed Makeba and she released &quot;Sangoma&quot; (&quot;Healer&quot;), an album of healing chants named in honour of her &quot;sangoma&quot; mother. 

In preparation for the Graceland tour, she worked with journalist James Hall to write an autobiography titled &quot;Makeba: My Story&quot;. The book contained descriptions of her experience with apartheid, and was also critical of the commodification and consumerism she experienced in the US. The book was translated into five languages. She took part in the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute, a popular-music concert staged on 11 June 1988 at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium, and broadcast to an audience of 600 million across 67 countries. Political aspects of the concert were heavily censored in the US by the Fox television network. The use of music to raise awareness of apartheid paid off: a survey after the concert found that among people aged between 16 and 24, three-quarters knew of Mandela, and supported his release from prison.

==Return to South Africa, final years and death==

Following growing pressure from the anti-apartheid movement both domestically and internationally, in 1990 State President Frederik Willem de Klerk reversed the ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organisations, and announced that Mandela would shortly be released from prison. Mandela was released in February 1990. He persuaded Makeba to try to return to South Africa; she obtained a six-day visa after months of effort, and entered South Africa using her French passport on 10 June 1990. Her arrival was a considerable event, featuring meetings, interviews, and singing by Brenda Fassie.
Makeba, Gillespie, Simone, and Masekela recorded and released her studio album, &quot;Eyes on Tomorrow&quot;, in 1991. It combined jazz, R&amp;B, pop, and traditional African music, and was a hit across Africa. Makeba and Gillespie then toured the world together to promote it. In November she made a guest appearance on a US sitcom, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. In April 1992, she performed two concerts in Johannesburg, her first in South Africa since her exile in 1960. In the same year she starred in the film &quot;Sarafina!&quot; which centred on students involved in the 1976 Soweto uprising. Makeba portrayed the title character&#x27;s mother, Angelina, a role which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as having been performed with &quot;immense dignity&quot;.

On 16 October 1999, Makeba was named a Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. In January 2000, her album, &quot;Homeland&quot;, produced by the New York City based record label Putumayo World Music, was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best World Music Album category. She worked closely with Graça Machel-Mandela, the South African first lady, advocating for children suffering from HIV/AIDS, child soldiers, and the physically handicapped. She established the Makeba Centre for Girls, a home for orphans, described in an obituary as her most personal project. She also took part in the 2002 documentary &quot;Amandla!: A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony&quot;, which examined the struggles of black South Africans against apartheid through the music of the period. Makeba&#x27;s second autobiography, &quot;Makeba: The Miriam Makeba Story&quot;, was published in 2004. In 2005 she announced that she would retire and began a farewell tour, but despite having osteoarthritis, continued to perform until her death. During this period, her grandchildren Nelson Lumumba Lee and Zenzi Lee, and her great-grandchild Lindelani, occasionally joined her performances.

On 9 November 2008, Makeba fell ill during a concert in Castel Volturno, Caserta, Italy. The concert had been organised to support the writer Roberto Saviano in his stand against the Camorra, a criminal organisation active in the region. She suffered a heart attack after singing her hit song &quot;Pata Pata&quot;, and was taken to the Pineta Grande clinic, where doctors were unable to revive her.

==Music and image==
===Musical style===
The groups with which Makeba began her career performed &quot;mbube&quot;, a style of vocal harmony which drew on American jazz, ragtime, and Anglican church hymns, as well as indigenous styles of music. Johannesburg musician Dolly Rathebe was an early influence on Makeba&#x27;s music, as were female jazz singers from the US. Historian David Coplan writes that the &quot;African jazz&quot; made popular by Makeba and others was &quot;inherently hybridized&quot; rather than derivative of any particular genre, blending as it did marabi and jazz, and was &quot;Americanized African music, not Africanized American music&quot;. The music that she performed was described by British writer Robin Denselow as a &quot;unique blend of rousing township styles and jazz-influenced balladry&quot;.

Makeba released more than 30 albums during her career. The dominant styles of these shifted over time, moving from African jazz to recordings influenced by Belafonte&#x27;s &quot;crooning&quot; to music drawing from traditional South African musical forms. She has been associated with the genres of world music and Afropop. She also incorporated Latin American musical styles into her performances. Historian Ruth Feldstein described her music as &quot;[crossing] the borders between what many people associated with avant-garde and &#x27;quality&#x27; culture and the commercial mainstream&quot;; the latter aspect often drew criticism. She was able to appeal to audiences from many political, racial, and national backgrounds.

She was known for having a dynamic vocal range, and was described as having an emotional awareness during her performances. She occasionally danced during her shows, and was described as having a sensuous presence on stage. She was able to vary her voice considerably: an obituary remarked that she &quot;could soar like an opera singer, but she could also whisper, roar, hiss, growl and shout. She could sing while making the epiglottal clicks of the Xhosa language.&quot; She sang in English and several African languages, but never in Afrikaans, the language of the apartheid government in South Africa. She once stated &quot;When Afrikaaners sing in my language, then I will sing theirs.&quot; English was seen as the language of political resistance by black South Africans due to the educational barriers they faced under apartheid; the Manhattan Brothers, with whom Makeba had sung in Sophiatown, had been prohibited from recording in English. Her songs in African languages have been described as reaffirming black pride.

===Politics and perception===
Makeba said that she did not perform political music, but music about her personal life in South Africa, which included describing the pain she felt living under apartheid. She once stated &quot;people say I sing politics, but what I sing is not politics, it is the truth&quot;, an example of the mixing of personal and political issues for musicians living during apartheid. When she first entered the US, she avoided discussing apartheid explicitly, partly out of concern for her family still in South Africa. Nonetheless, she is known for using her voice to convey the political message of opposition to apartheid, performing widely and frequently for civil rights and anti-apartheid organisations. Even songs that did not carry an explicitly political message were seen as subversive, due to their being banned in South Africa. Makeba saw her music as a tool of activism, saying &quot;In our struggle, songs are not simply entertainment for us. They are the way we communicate.&quot; She expressed her political views, and criticism of apartheid in particular, more frequently in later years; her exile, and the death of her daughter, have both been identified as making her more vocal.

Makeba&#x27;s use of the clicks common in languages such as Xhosa and Zulu (as in &quot;Qongqothwane&quot;, &quot;The Click Song&quot;) was frequently remarked upon by Western audiences. It contributed to her popularity and her exotic image, which scholars have described as a kind of othering, exacerbated by the fact that Western audiences often could not understand her lyrics. Critics in the US described her as the &quot;African tribeswoman&quot; and as an &quot;import from South Africa&quot;, often depicting her in condescending terms as a product of a more primitive society. In seeing her as an embodiment of Africa, Western audiences tended to ignore her cosmopolitan background. Conversely, she is also described as shaping Pan-African identity during the decline of colonialism. Commentators also frequently described her in terms of the prominent men she was associated with, despite her own prominence. During her early career in South Africa she had been seen as a sex symbol, an image that received considerably less attention in the US.

Makeba was described as a style icon, both in her home country and the US. She wore no makeup and refused to straighten her hair for shows, thus helping establish a style that came to be known internationally as the &quot;Afro look&quot;. According to music scholar Tanisha Ford, her hairstyle represented a &quot;liberated African beauty aesthetic&quot;. She was seen as a beauty icon by South African schoolgirls, who were compelled to shorten their hair by the apartheid government. Makeba stuck to wearing African jewellery; she disapproved of the skin-lighteners commonly used by South African women at the time, and refused to appear in advertisements for them. Her self-presentation has been characterised by scholars as a rejection of the predominantly white standards of beauty that women in the US were held to, which allowed Makeba to partially escape the sexualisation directed at women performers during this period. Nonetheless, the terms used to describe her in the US media have been identified by scholars as frequently used to &quot;sexualize, infantalize, and animalize&quot; people of African heritage.

==Legacy==
===Musical influence===

Makeba was among the most visible Africans in the US; as a result, she was often emblematic of the continent of Africa for Americans. Her music earned her the moniker &quot;Mama Africa&quot;, and she was variously described as the &quot;Empress of African Song&quot;, the &quot;Queen of South African music&quot;, and Africa&#x27;s &quot;first superstar&quot;. Music scholar J. U. Jacobs said that Makeba&#x27;s music had &quot;both been shaped by and given shape to black South African and American music&quot;. The jazz musician Abbey Lincoln is among those identified as being influenced by Makeba. Makeba and Simone were among a group of artists who helped shape soul music. Longtime collaborator Belafonte called her &quot;the most revolutionary new talent to appear in any medium in the last decade&quot;. Speaking after her death, Mandela called her &quot;South Africa&#x27;s first lady of song&quot;, and said that &quot;her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.&quot;

Outside her home country Makeba was credited with bringing African music to a Western audience. She is credited, along with artists such as Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Salif Keita, Ali Farka Touré, Baaba Maal and Angélique Kidjo, with popularising the genre of world music. She disliked this label, however, believing it marginalized music from the &quot;third world&quot;. Her work with Belafonte in the 1960s has been described as creating the genre of world music before the concept entered the popular imagination, and also as highlighting the diversity and cultural pluralism within African music. Within South Africa, Makeba has been described as influencing artists such as kwaito musician Thandiswa Mazwai and her band Bongo Maffin, whose track &quot;De Makeba&quot; was a modified version of Makeba&#x27;s &quot;Pata Pata&quot;, and one of several tribute recordings released after her return to South Africa. South African jazz musician Simphiwe Dana has been described as &quot;the new Miriam Makeba&quot;. South African singer Lira has frequently been compared with Makeba, particularly for her performance of &quot;Pata Pata&quot; during the opening ceremony of the 2010 Football World Cup. A year later, Kidjo dedicated her concert in New York to Makeba, as a musician who had &quot;paved the way for her success&quot;. In an obituary, scholar Lara Allen referred to Makeba as &quot;arguably South Africa&#x27;s most famous musical export&quot;. 

===Activism===
Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including &quot;Meadowlands&quot; by Strike Vilakezi and &quot;Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd&quot; (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of &quot;apartheid&#x27;s cruelty&quot;, and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba&#x27;s records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that &quot;there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.&quot;

Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: &quot;Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people are the victims of capitalism, racism and oppression, period&quot;. After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael&#x27;s message that &quot;black is beautiful&quot;. Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to racial and gender disparities, and highlighting &quot;that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex&quot;. Makeba&#x27;s critique of second-wave feminism as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to call her a feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both black feminism and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the &quot;most steadfast voices for social justice&quot;.

===Awards and recognition===

Makeba&#x27;s 1965 collaboration with Harry Belafonte won a Grammy Award, making her the first African recording artist to win this award. She was named the Best Female Artist of Africa and honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the 1996 Kora Awards. At the South African Music Awards (SAMAs), she received five awards: Best Female Artist and Best adult contemporary african album for her 2000 album &quot;Homeland&quot; at the eighth ceremony in 2001, along with awards for Best adult contemporary album and Best Jazz Vocal album for her 2003 album &quot;Reflections&quot;, as well as Best DVD for her live album &quot;Live at Bern&#x27;s Salonger, Stockholm, Sweden, 1966&quot;, at the tenth ceremony in 2004. Makeba shared the 2001 Polar Music Prize with Sofia Gubaidulina. They received their prize from Carl XVI Gustaf, the King of Sweden, during a nationally televised ceremony at Berwaldhallen, Stockholm, on 27 May 2002. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed her 53rd in its list of &quot;The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot; in 2023.
Makeba won the Dag Hammarskjöld Peace Prize in 1986, and in 2001 was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold by the United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN) in Berlin, &quot;for outstanding services to peace and international understanding&quot;. She also received several honorary doctorates. In 2003, she was awarded South Africa&#x27;s Order for Meritorious Service, and in the next year, she was voted 38th in a poll ranking 100 Great South Africans.

The University of Fort Hare&#x27;s Miriam Makeba Centre of Performing Arts, which was established around 2003, was named in her honour. From 25 to 27 September 2009, a tribute television show to Makeba, entitled &quot;Hommage à Miriam Makeba&quot; and curated by Beninoise singer-songwriter and activist Angélique Kidjo, was held at the Cirque d&#x27;hiver in Paris. The show was presented as &quot;Mama Africa: Celebrating Miriam Makeba&quot; at the Barbican in London on 21 November 2009. A documentary film titled &quot;Mama Africa&quot;, about Makeba&#x27;s life, co-written and directed by Finnish director Mika Kaurismäki, was released in 2011. On 4 March 2013, and again on International Women&#x27;s Day in 2017, Google honoured her with a Google Doodle on their homepage. In 2014 she was honoured (along with Nelson Mandela, Albertina Sisulu and Steve Biko) in the Belgian city of Ghent, which named a square after her, the &quot;Miriam Makebaplein&quot;. Makeba was named 1967&#x27;s &quot;woman of the year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2020, as one of a list of 100 &quot;women of the year&quot; for the years 1920–2019. 

In 2015 the French singer Jain released &quot;Makeba&quot;, a tribute. &quot;Mama Africa&quot;, a musical about Makeba, was produced in South Africa by Niyi Coker. Originally titled &quot;Zenzi!&quot;, the musical premiered to a sold-out crowd in Cape Town on 26 May 2016. It was performed in the US in St. Louis, Missouri and at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York City between October and December 2016. The musical returned to South Africa in February 2017 for what would have been Makeba&#x27;s 85th birthday. American-born African jazz singer Somi wrote a play about Makeba, &quot;Dreaming Zenzile&quot;, which premiered in 2021, and released a tribute album dedicated to her, &quot;Zenzile: The Reimagination of Miriam Makeba&quot; (2022). 
In June 2023, &quot;Makeba&quot; received a resurgence in popularity due to the virality it achieved on TikTok.

<text>Josh Weinstein (born May 5, 1966) is an American television writer and producer, known for his work on the animated comedy series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Weinstein and Bill Oakley became best friends and writing partners at St. Albans School; Weinstein then attended Stanford University and was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Stanford Chaparral&quot;. He worked on several short-term media projects, including writing for the variety show &quot;Sunday Best&quot;, but was then unemployed for a long period.

Weinstein and Oakley eventually penned a spec script for &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, after which they wrote &quot;Marge Gets a Job&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Subsequently, the two were hired to write for the show on a permanent basis in 1992. After they wrote episodes such as &quot;$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)&quot;, &quot;Bart vs. Australia&quot; and &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;, the two were appointed executive producers and showrunners for the seventh and eighth seasons of the show. They attempted to include several emotional episodes focusing on the Simpson family, as well as several high-concept episodes such as &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot;, &quot;Two Bad Neighbors&quot; and &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot;, winning three Primetime Emmy Awards for their work.

After they left &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Oakley and Weinstein created &quot;Mission Hill&quot;. They worked as consulting producers on &quot;Futurama&quot;, then created &quot;The Mullets&quot; in 2003. The two wrote several unsuccessful TV pilots, and were due to serve as showrunners on &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot; in 2009. Oakley left the project over a contract dispute, but Weinstein remained until it was canceled. He co-produced and wrote for &quot;Futurama&quot; again during its Comedy Central revival, winning an Emmy in 2011. Since 2013, Weinstein has served as showrunner for the CBBC series &quot;Strange Hill High&quot;, and in 2015, &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;. He has also served as a writer for season two of &quot;Gravity Falls&quot;, co-writing nine of the season&#x27;s episodes. In 2018, Weinstein co-developed the Netflix animated series &quot;Disenchantment&quot; with creator Matt Groening, of which he and Groening served as co-showrunners. Weinstein is married to journalist Lisa Simmons.

==Early life==
Weinstein was born and raised in Washington, D.C. to Jewish parents Rosa and Harris Weinstein. His mother is the director of the Himmelfarb Mobile University which provides education for the elderly, while his father is a lawyer for Covington &amp; Burling. He has a brother, Jacob, and a sister, Teme. Weinstein attended St. Albans School in Washington, D.C., where he met and became best friends with Bill Oakley in the eighth grade. The two created the school humor magazine &quot;The Alban Antic&quot; in 1983. He later attended Stanford University, where he served as editor-in-chief of the &quot;Stanford Chaparral&quot;. Weinstein is an honorary member of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; as he worked on some of &quot;Lampoon&quot;&#x27;s parody publications with Oakley over the summers between course years.

==Career==
Weinstein did not land a job on a major comedy series, despite writing numerous spec scripts for shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;; he moved back home to Washington, D.C. There, he worked as a copywriter for an advertising agency, writing print adverts for such clients as IKEA. In their free time, Oakley and Weinstein wrote for local comedy groups, such as Gross National Product. In 1989, they moved to New York City after being hired to write for a game show on Ha!, before writing for a variety show on the network featuring Denis Leary. The two also wrote for the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; and &quot;Spy&quot;. An editor of &quot;Spy&quot; was hired by NBC to run the variety show &quot;Sunday Best&quot;, and took Oakley and Weinstein to Los Angeles with him in 1991. When the show was canceled after three episodes, they were unemployed for a lengthy period.

===&quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
====As a writer====
After changing their agent, they wrote a spec script for &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, which was well received. Amongst those who liked it were Al Jean and Mike Reiss, showrunners of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. There were no openings on the staff at the time, but Oakley and Weinstein were hired to write the episode &quot;Marge Gets a Job&quot;, based on an idea by Conan O&#x27;Brien. The episode aired as part of season four. Their &quot;Seinfeld&quot; script and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode caught the attention of Diane English, and they were offered a job on a sitcom. Before they accepted this job, they were told that Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky were leaving &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and then joined the writing staff on a permanent basis in 1992, in the third season of that show. They began as story editors. They were initially quiet and felt &quot;intimidated&quot;, being in the same room as &quot;10 of the greatest minds in comedy&quot;, but eventually started pitching jokes with confidence. They wrote their scripts together, working side by side at a computer. Their first episode as staff writers was &quot;Marge in Chains&quot;, an existing idea that they were assigned. The first draft of the script was based on research about women in prison conducted by Oakley and Weinstein, making it &quot;slightly more realistic&quot; than the final version of the episode, in which many realistic elements were replaced.
After season four, most of the original staff left the show. Before David Mirkin arrived to take over as showrunner for season five, Oakley, Weinstein, O&#x27;Brien and Dan McGrath were the only writers working on the show and spent a month mapping out most of the season&#x27;s episodes. Oakley and Weinstein wrote several episodes for season five, penning the &quot;Terror at 5½ Feet&quot; segment of &quot;Treehouse of Horror IV&quot;, &quot;$pringfield (Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Legalized Gambling)&quot;, &quot;Lisa vs. Malibu Stacy&quot;, the show&#x27;s 100th episode &quot;Sweet Seymour Skinner&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; and &quot;Lady Bouvier&#x27;s Lover&quot;. For season six they wrote &quot;Sideshow Bob Roberts&quot;, basing much of the episode on the Watergate scandal, in which they had a great interest, as well as &quot;Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy&quot; and &quot;Bart vs. Australia&quot;. For &quot;Bart vs. Australia&quot;, the writing staff wanted to produce an episode in which the Simpsons family traveled to a foreign country; they selected Australia because they thought that everyone in Australia had a good sense of humor and &quot;would get the jokes&quot;, with the episode being intentionally inaccurate. The episode proved somewhat controversial; some Australian fans said the episode was a mockery of their country. Shortly after it had aired, the &quot;Simpsons&quot; staff received over a hundred letters from Australians who were insulted by the episode. The pair wrote the two-part episode &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;, which was initially proposed by series creator Matt Groening. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it look like it was not a complete accident.

====As showrunner====
Oakley and Weinstein were appointed executive producers and showrunners of the seventh and eighth seasons. They were chosen partly because they had been with the show since the third season and understood many of its dynamics. The showrunner is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the show&#x27;s production. Each episode takes ten months to produce, so the showrunner must &quot;oversee many different episodes in different stages of production all at the same time&quot;, with roles including head writer, making notes on the storyboards and working with the voice actors, animators, editors and composers. Oakley and Weinstein often set two script-rewriting rooms in motion at the same time, delegating leadership in the rooms to writers such as Steve Tompkins and David Cohen. Mirkin, who had suggested that the two take over, remained on the show in an advisory capacity, helping Oakley and Weinstein with technical aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing. When they took over the series, they wanted many of the episodes to be realistic ones that focused more on the five members of the Simpson family and explored their feelings and emotions towards each other. They wanted to produce &quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episodes, episodes about Sideshow Bob, Itchy &amp; Scratchy and several &quot;format-bending&quot; episodes such as &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot;, for which Weinstein wrote the scene featuring Comic Book Guy and Milhouse Van Houten. They aimed for &quot;at least two episodes per season that &#x27;pushed the envelope&#x27;, [and] expanded the definition of what an episode could be&quot;. This was a style they employed for both seasons they produced. Season eight featured several episodes in which focus was given to secondary characters and in which new issues were explored, such as divorce. Their preferred choice of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices, and several of their guest stars were &quot;old grizzled men with distinctive voices&quot; such as R. Lee Ermey, Donald Sutherland, Kirk Douglas and Lawrence Tierney. Oakley considered season three to be the single greatest comedic season of television ever produced and so attempted to recreate the feel of that season for the two he ran, focusing on stories with real emotions and situations, as well as some episodes. Season three was their basis for Homer: &quot;We liked Homer the way he was in the second and third seasons. That was what we consciously used as our model. Dimwitted, loving, hyper-enthusiastic, creatively goofy, parody of the American father – drawn with real emotions, though admittedly amplified. This was exemplified in &quot;Mother Simpson&quot;, &quot;Lisa the Iconoclast&quot;, &quot;Diddly-Dum-Doodly&quot;, and a couple others. In some of the less reality-based episodes, i.e. the Beer Baron one – usually Swartzwelder&#x27;s, we&#x27;d treat this stricture with a certain amount of latitude.&quot;

One of their most notable episodes was &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot;, an episode designed to &quot;push the envelope conceptually&quot;. The idea for &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; was first conceived by Oakley who thought that Homer should have an enemy. This evolved into the concept of a &quot;real world&quot; co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results. The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer&#x27;s success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering &quot;real American hero,&quot; is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. Oakley says the episode was &quot;hyper-meta&quot; and focused on &quot;parodying to some degree the Homer we don&#x27;t like. That&#x27;s one of the things that episode is supposed to illustrate — &quot;Homer gone wrong&quot;. Although, I would argue that in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; he&#x27;s not even really even all that excessively stupid or immature, actually.&quot; Weinstein said: &quot;We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was &quot;What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer&#x27;s universe and deal with him?&quot; I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [on NoHomers.net] about the ending—we just did that because (a) it&#x27;s really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of &quot;sometimes, you just can&#x27;t win&quot;—the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life-threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned.&quot; When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans &quot;didn&#x27;t get&quot;. Weinstein also talks about a &quot;generation gap&quot;—the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.

Other episodes included &quot;Two Bad Neighbors&quot;, which sees Homer meet former President George H. W. Bush, a reference to the show&#x27;s feud with the Bushes in the early 1990s. Weinstein said that the episode is often misunderstood. Many audiences expected a political satire, while the writers made special effort to keep the parody apolitical. Oakley stresses that &quot;it&#x27;s not a political attack, it&#x27;s a personal attack!&quot;, and instead of criticizing Bush for his policies, the episode instead pokes fun at his &quot;crotchetiness&quot;. Oakley described the episode as a companion piece to &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot;, in that a character is juxtaposed alongside Homer and does not get along with him.

They considered working on the show to be similar to working in a bubble due to the lack of interference from the Fox network&#x27;s executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: &quot;The great thing about &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren&#x27;t any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn&#x27;t do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like &quot;Two Bad Neighbors&quot; and &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; we managed to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us.&quot; Such was the network&#x27;s limited input, when an executive suggested the staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to &quot;liven up the show&quot;, the staff rejected the idea and instead created the episode &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;, inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was living with the family, as a reference to the executive&#x27;s proposal. The episode, which marked the point at which &quot;The Simpsons&quot; surpassed &quot;The Flintstones&quot; for the number of episodes produced for an animated series, was named by the BBC as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show. They noted &quot;the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show.&quot; The intrusion of the network censors was limited: the normal procedure is for an episode&#x27;s script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted, causing limited problems as often the offending lines are removed or changed for comedic purposes after animation. The episode &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; drew the censor&#x27;s objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word &quot;gay&quot;, or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that &quot;the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast&quot;. The censor problems ultimately came to nothing when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: &quot;acceptable for broadcast&quot;.

====Leaving the show====
Oakley and Weinstein stood down as showrunners after season eight because they &quot;didn&#x27;t want to break [the show]&quot;. Oakley said: &quot;We always said we&#x27;d never do a joke that we&#x27;d done before.&quot; They felt the showrunner should not stay for more than two seasons. Due to the pressures of having to work on two seasons at once (writing season eight, whilst doing post-production of season seven), Oakley said that at least two episodes from season eight would ideally have been rewritten, had there been sufficient time, and that towards the end, they were &quot;treading water&quot;. As they were working on post-production of season eight, they were credited as consulting producers for season nine, which was in its initial writing stages. Oakley stated that they contributed &quot;somewhere between 0 and .0001%&quot; of the season, only attending the table readings of the scripts. They produced three episodes held over from season eight, which aired as part of season nine: &quot;The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson&quot;, &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; and &quot;Lisa the Simpson&quot;. &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; was negatively received due to the sudden revelation that long-time character Seymour Skinner was actually an imposter. For example, in his book &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, Chris Turner describes &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; as the &quot;broadcast that marked [the] abrupt plunge&quot; from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; &quot;Golden Age&quot;, which he says began in the middle of the show&#x27;s third season. He calls the episode &quot;[one of] the weakest episodes in &quot;Simpsons&quot; history&quot;. As such, they consider it the most controversial episode from their tenure as executive producers. He and Oakley advise viewers to treat &quot;The Principal and the Pauper&quot; as an &quot;experiment&quot;. They surmise that the negative reception was partly due to the fact that it was not immediately apparent to viewers that this was such an episode (as opposed to, for example, &quot;The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase&quot;). They describe the ending of the episode as an attempt to reset the continuity and allow fans to consider the episode on its own. &quot;Lisa the Simpson&quot; was their final involvement with the show. The duo wanted to end on a good note—Weinstein stated that the episode &quot;was meant to embody the humor, depth, and emotions of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;,&quot;—and they were pleased with the result.

====Awards and critical reaction====
Weinstein won three Emmys for his work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and shared them with the other producers. When Weinstein was the showrunner and executive producer, &quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot; won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less) in 1997. The previous year, &quot;Treehouse of Horror VI&quot; was submitted for the award. The staff felt the 3D animation sequence &quot;Homer³&quot; would have given it the edge. The episode eventually lost to &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;. Oakley later expressed regret about not submitting an episode with a more emotionally driven plot, such as &quot;Mother Simpson&quot;. In 1996, during season seven, the show received a Peabody Award. Weinstein shared the awards for &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and &quot;Trash of the Titans&quot; in 1995 and 1998 respectively. Oakley and Weinstein themselves were nominated, along with the show&#x27;s composer Alf Clausen, for the Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics for writing &quot;Señor Burns&quot; from &quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part Two)&quot;.

Many of the episodes by Oakley and Weinstein are considered amongst the show&#x27;s best. For example, in 2003, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; included six episodes they produced (&quot;Homer&#x27;s Phobia&quot;, &quot;A Fish Called Selma&quot;, &quot;The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson&quot;, &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase&quot; and &quot;The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show&quot;) and one episode they wrote (&quot;Who Shot Mr. Burns?&quot;) as part of their list of the show&#x27;s 25 best episodes. Robert Canning of IGN said the episode &quot;You Only Move Twice&quot; from season eight &quot;may well be the greatest &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode of all time. In my book, it&#x27;s at least tied,&quot; with &quot;Marge vs. the Monorail&quot;. A. O. Scott described their era as &quot;reach[ing] a pinnacle of zany self-reference with &quot;22 Short Films About Springfield&quot; and &quot;Simpsons Spin-off Showcase&quot;.&quot; Weinstein considers the line &quot;Too crazy for Boy&#x27;s Town, too much of a boy for Crazy Town&quot;, from the episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror VII&quot; to be his favorite joke contribution to the show. The two are popular amongst the show&#x27;s fans, and in the early days of the Internet, Oakley read and participated in fan discussion of the show on newsgroups such as alt.tv.simpsons. In 2005 and 2006, they participated in two question-and-answer sessions on the fan message board NoHomers.net.

===&quot;Mission Hill&quot; and other work===
After Oakley and Weinstein left &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, they created &quot;Mission Hill&quot; in 1997, a show about a hip, lazy, 24-year-old cartoonist named Andy French, and sold it to The WB for a fall 1999 debut. They pitched the show in 1998 &quot;as an animated series for young adults with a sophisticated, &#x27;&quot;Simpsons&quot;&#x27;-style sensibility.&quot; They aimed to make the show about realistic issues affecting young adults, which were too mature for &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The network was impressed and initially ordered 13 episodes; they ordered five more once the first was completed. Oakley explained: &quot;The audience we&#x27;re going for is one that&#x27;s sophisticated, that likes high and low humor, that&#x27;s very savvy in animation. [But] this show is definitely a case where a lot of people don&#x27;t get it. It&#x27;s not setup, setup, setup, punch line. It&#x27;s observational humor. It&#x27;s jokes told in a weird way, in the background or with a bizarre sound effect.&quot; The show was plagued by &quot;public relations&quot; difficulties, which meant it was &quot;tarnished&quot; from the start. A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show, sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual upfronts, was poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the upfronts did not matter. Similarly, because no episodes were finished in time, journalists were not able to see anything of the show at the network&#x27;s schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as Weinstein commented to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;for seven months, the only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape that looked terrible. Six major publications panned it before they even saw it.&quot; The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications such as &quot;The Deseret News&quot;; and earned a positive write-up in &quot;Variety&quot;. Furthermore, the show was forced to change from its originally planned title of &quot;The Downtowners&quot; due to its closeness to an MTV show. All of these factors combined to ensure the show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials for it. Weinstein stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t know exactly why America doesn&#x27;t know about this show. It&#x27;s like &quot;Teen People&quot; came out with its fall preview, and we&#x27;re not even in it.&quot; &quot;Mission Hill&quot; came at a time when the TV schedules were already saturated with animated shows; some of the response could be chalked up to its genre.

The show was put out on a Friday, a night on which the WB had never broadcast before, at 8:00 pm, a time Oakley felt was inappropriate, and aired in front of &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot; and &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;, all shows with which Oakley felt it was &quot;incompatible&quot;. The show&#x27;s poor reviews and ratings of an average of 1.8 million led to its swift cancellation. Oakley concluded that the pair had been &quot;very naive&quot; with regard to producing the show, and that it &quot;would&#x27;ve been better on cable anyway because it would never have appealed to a broad enough audience due to the subject matter&quot;. The 13 completed episodes were later aired on Cartoon Network&#x27;s adult swim block and the show garnered a worldwide cult following. After lobbying from Oakley and Weinstein, the WB eventually released the series on DVD.

From 2001 to 2002, the two served as consulting producers on &quot;Futurama&quot;. They worked for two-and-a-half days a week, contributing jokes and helping with stories. They worked most substantially on the episodes &quot;That&#x27;s Lobstertainment!&quot; and &quot;Roswell That Ends Well&quot;. They produced &quot;The Mullets&quot; for UPN in 2003. Oakley and Weinstein have written and produced several television pilots. These include a CBS dramedy entitled &quot;22 Birthdays&quot;, &quot;Business Class&quot;, a comedy for NBC about two traveling salesmen, &quot;The Funkhousers&quot;, an off-the-wall comedy for ABC about a close-knit family which was directed by Frank Oz and &quot;The Ruling Class&quot; for Fox, about a high school class who all got along, regardless of their social group. They have written two feature film screenplays: &quot;The Optimist&quot; for New Line Cinema, in which Seann William Scott was slated to star as a man born with no unhappiness gene, and &quot;Ruprecht&quot;, a Santa Claus-related comedy for Disney.

Weinstein was due to serve with Oakley as an executive producer on the Fox animated television series &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot; in 2009, which was created by Mitchell Hurwitz. The show, which was based on an Australian program, featured cartoon characters on live-action backgrounds. However, Oakley ended his involvement with the show due to a contract dispute between the staff and Sony Pictures. Sony refused to offer a contract which operated under the complete terms of the Writers Guild of America. Weinstein continued working on the show, before it was canceled after 13 episodes. Weinstein returned to &quot;Futurama&quot;, following its revival on Comedy Central in 2010, and served as a writer and co-executive producer on its sixth and seventh seasons. He wrote the episodes &quot;That Darn Katz!&quot;, &quot;Law and Oracle&quot;, &quot;All the Presidents&#x27; Heads&quot;, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, &quot;Viva Mars Vegas&quot; and T.: The Terrestrial. Weinstein shared another Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program for the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;The Late Philip J. Fry&quot; in 2011, being nominated again the following year for &quot;The Tip of the Zoidberg&quot;. Individually, he received an Annie Award nomination for Writing in a Television Production for the episode &quot;All the Presidents&#x27; Heads&quot; in 2011, and a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for Outstanding Animation for writing &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; in 2013.

In 2013, Weinstein co-created, produced and wrote the animated comedy-mystery series &quot;Strange Hill High&quot; for British children&#x27;s channel CBBC. For the series, Weinstein imported the role of the showrunner and the writer&#x27;s room, used routinely on American television shows like &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, but uncommon on British television. The show uses the animation technique hypervynorama, a mix of puppetry and CGI. Weinstein will also team up with Oakley again to co-write and co-executive produce &quot;22 Birthdays&quot;, the failed pilot they originally produced for CBS, as a pilot for Bravo. Doug Liman and Dave Bartis will also be co-executive producers.

On September 17, 2021, Weinstein guest starred as a contestant on the YouTube web series, Puppet History.

In August 2022, Weinstein appeared in an episode of Rate My Takeaway where he enjoyed a burger and fries over a chat with the host Danny Malin. Weinstein was a long time fan of the Youtube channel and when Malin was on a tour of the US they arranged the meet up.

==Personal life==
Weinstein married Lisa Simmons, a West Coast editor of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, in a Jewish ceremony in 1995. They have two children, twins Molly and Simon, born in 1999.

<doc id="598373" wikidata="Q1327527" url="?curid=598373" title="Electropolishing">
<text>Electropolishing, also known as electrochemical polishing, anodic polishing, or electrolytic polishing (especially in the metallography field), is an electrochemical process that removes material from a metallic workpiece, reducing the surface roughness by levelling micro-peaks and valleys, improving the surface finish. Electropolishing is often compared to, but distinctly different from, electrochemical machining. It is used to polish, passivate, and deburr metal parts. It is often described as the reverse of electroplating. It may be used in lieu of abrasive fine polishing in microstructural preparation.

==Mechanism==
Typically, the work-piece is immersed in a temperature-controlled bath of electrolyte and serves as the anode; it is connected to the positive terminal of a DC power supply, the negative terminal being attached to the cathode. A current passes from the anode, where metal on the surface is oxidised and dissolved in the electrolyte, to the cathode. At the cathode, a reduction reaction occurs, which normally produces hydrogen. Electrolytes used for electropolishing are most often concentrated acid solutions such as mixtures of sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid. Other electropolishing electrolytes reported in the literature include mixtures of perchloric acid with acetic anhydride (which has caused fatal explosions), and methanolic solutions of sulfuric acid.

To electropolish a rough surface, the protruding parts of a surface profile must dissolve faster than the recesses. This process, referred to as &quot;anodic leveling&quot;, can be subject to incorrect analysis when measuring the surface topography. Anodic dissolution under electropolishing conditions deburrs metal objects due to increased current density on corners and burrs.
Most importantly, successful electropolishing should operate under diffusion limited constant current plateau, achieved by following current dependence on voltage (polarisation curve), under constant temperature and stirring conditions.

==Applications==
Due to its ease of operation and its usefulness in polishing irregularly-shaped objects, electropolishing has become a common process in the production of semiconductors.

As electropolishing can also be used to sterilize workpieces, the process plays an essential role in the food, medical, and pharmaceutical industries.

It is commonly used in the post-production of large metal pieces such as those used in drums of washing machines, bodies of ocean vessels and aircraft, and automobiles.

While nearly any metal may be electropolished, the most-commonly polished metals are 300- and 400-series stainless steel, aluminum, copper, titanium, and nickel- and copper-alloys.

Ultra-high vacuum (UHV) components are typically electropolished in order to have a smoother surface for improved vacuum pressures, out-gassing rates, and pumping speed.

Electropolishing is commonly used to prepare thin metal samples for transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography because the process does not mechanically deform surface layers like mechanical polishing does.

==Standards==
*ISO.15730:2000 Metallic and other Inorganic Coatings - Electropolishing as a Means of Smoothing and Passivating Stainless Steel
*ASME BPE Standards for Electropolishing Bioprocessing Equipment
*SEMI F19, Electropolishing Specifications for Semiconductor Applications
*ASTM B 912-02 (2008), Passivation of Stainless Steels Using Electropolishing
*ASTM E1558, Standard Guide for Electrolytic Polishing of Metallographic Specimens

==Benefits==
* The results are aesthetically pleasing.
* Creates a clean, smooth surface that is easier to sterilise.
* Can polish areas that are inaccessible by other polishing methods.
* Removes a small amount of material (typically 20-40 micrometre in depth in the case of stainless steel) from the surface of the parts, while also removing small burrs or high spots. It can be used to reduce the size of parts when necessary.
* Stainless steel preferentially removes iron from the surface and enhances the chromium/nickel content for the most superior form of passivation for stainless steel.
* Electropolishing can be used on a wide range of metals including stainless steel, aluminum, copper, brass and titanium.

<doc id="598376" wikidata="Q7765065" url="?curid=598376" title="The Social Animal (Aronson book)">
<text>The Social Animal is an APA-medal winning book about social psychology by Elliot Aronson. Originally published in 1972, &quot;The Social Animal&quot; is currently in its twelfth edition. In a style written for the general audience, the book covers what modern psychology knows about the reasons for some of the most important aspects of human behavior.

==Contents==
Aronson begins the book by citing a number of scenarios, real and constructed—reactions to the Kent State shootings, the Stanford prison experiments, and a four-year-old boy given a drum set among them—that illustrate a variety of human behaviors seen in real life. The rest of the book is spent primarily on explaining how human minds operate and interact with each other, using these situations as examples. The book covering topics include the causes of prejudice, aggression, and cognitive dissonance.

In explaining the reasons why people behave in unusual ways, Aronson cites his &quot;first law&quot;:
People who do crazy things are not necessarily crazy.
==Style and use of experimental method==
As a scientist, Aronson leans on the importance of case work and experimental study. Thus, the &quot;Social Animal&#x27;s&quot; explanations of human behavior are largely validated with citations of studies done by researchers of social psychology. Throughout the book, Aronson relies on the use of controlled experiments to validate empirical observation.

<doc id="598379" wikidata="Q425056" url="?curid=598379" title="Plasma protein">
<text>Plasma proteins, sometimes referred to as blood proteins, are proteins present in blood plasma. They perform many different functions, including transport of hormones, vitamins and minerals in activity and functioning of the immune system. Other blood proteins act as enzymes, complement, components, protease inhibitors or kinin precursors. Contrary to popular belief, haemoglobin is not a blood protein, as it is carried within red blood cells, rather than in the blood serum.Haemoglobin provides red colour to the blood. It also carries oxygen and transport to all the body cells.

Serum albumin accounts for 55% of blood proteins, is a major contributor to maintaining the oncotic pressure of plasma and assists, as a carrier, in the transport of lipids and steroid hormones. Globulins make up 38% of blood proteins and transport ions, hormones, and lipids assisting in immune function. Fibrinogen comprises 7% of blood proteins; conversion of fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin is essential for blood clotting. The remainder of the plasma proteins (1%) are regulatory proteins, such as enzymes, proenzymes, and hormones. All blood proteins are synthesized in liver except for the gamma globulins.

==Families of blood proteins==
Examples of specific blood proteins:
* Prealbumin (transthyretin)
* Alpha 1 antitrypsin (neutralizes trypsin that has leaked from the digestive system)
* Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein
* Alpha-1-fetoprotein
* alpha2-macroglobulin
* Gamma globulins
* Beta-2 microglobulin
* Haptoglobin
* Human Serum Albumin
* Ceruloplasmin
* Complement component 3
* Complement component 4
* C-reactive protein (CRP)
* Lipoproteins (chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, HDL)
* Transferrin
* Prothrombin
* MBL or MBP

== Clinical significance ==
Separating serum proteins by electrophoresis is a valuable diagnostic tool, as well as a way to monitor clinical progress. Current research regarding blood plasma proteins is centered on performing proteomics analyses of serum/plasma in the search for biomarkers. These efforts started with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis efforts in the 1970s, and in more recent times this research has been performed using LC-tandem MS based proteomics. The normal laboratory value of serum total protein is around 7 g/dL.

Scientists are able to identify blood proteins using Photo-affinity labeling, a means of using photo-reactive ligands as a labeling agent to identify targeted proteins.

<text>Fabiana Bravo (born in 1969), is an Argentine operatic soprano.

==Life and work==
Fabiana Bravo was born in Guaymallén Department, outside Mendoza, Argentina, to a family of modest means. She moved to Buenos Aires at age 22, and sought parts in the city&#x27;s theatre scene. She appeared in José Cibrián&#x27;s &quot;Drácula&quot;, and Peter MacFarlane&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Follies&quot; and &quot;Broadway II&quot;, among other productions. It was a personally tailored full scholarship program at The Catholic University of America that brought Fabiana Bravo from Argentina to Washington, D.C. From there she also studied interpretation at the Renata Scotto Institute in Savona, Italy, and Verdian repertoire at the Verdi Opera Studio in Parma, Italy. Finally, she accepted a one-year scholarship program to study in Voghera, Italy, at the Academy of Vocal Arts. Her talent was noticed by singer Valeria Lynch, who hired Bravo and who, in 1995 introduced her to Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti. Pavarotti included Bravo in an operatic talent contest, which she won, and which led to her role with Pavarotti as Lucia di Lammermoor at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Fabiana Bravo met with and performed for the United States Supreme Court in 1999, and has brought recognition of her hometown of Mendoza, through a series of South American Recitals. She was added to the Metropolitan Opera Roster in the 2001/2002 season, and continues to perform in New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Chicago with regularity. She would go on to portray Tosca, Countess Almaviva, Leonora, Giorgetta, and Madama Butterfly. In 1999, she was named Argentina&#x27;s Woman of the Year for her remarkable contributions to the arts. She has also received numerous awards such as a Plácido Domingo Operalia Finalist, Opera Index winner and Met Council Winner of the Regional Finalist Competition.

In recent years, Bravo has sung the Countess Almaviva in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (1997), Mimi in &quot;La bohème&quot; (1998), Donna Anna in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1999) and the title role in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (2002), all in opera productions of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Summer Opera Theatre Company. She also sings with Virginia Opera.

She performs in concert and opera throughout the world. Ms. Bravo currently resides in Washington, D.C., and Mendoza, Argentina.

<doc id="598383" wikidata="Q5163067" url="?curid=598383" title="2001 Conservative Party leadership election">
<text>The 2001 Conservative Party leadership election was held after the party failed to make inroads into the Labour government&#x27;s lead in the 2001 general election. Party leader William Hague resigned, and a leadership contest was called under new rules Hague had introduced. Five candidates came forward: Michael Ancram, David Davis, Kenneth Clarke, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Portillo.

Duncan Smith was announced winner of the election on 13 September 2001, serving until 2003, and Ancram was subsequently awarded the Deputy Leadership, serving until 2005.

==Candidates and their platforms==
Ancram stood declaring that none of the other candidates were close to his form of Conservatism, as well as arguing that he was best placed to unite the party. As the party chairman for the previous three years, he was widely seen as the candidate who best represented a continuity in the direction of the Hague years.

Clarke had previously stood in the 1997 leadership election but had otherwise maintained a low profile in the subsequent four years. It was argued that his non-involvement in the party&#x27;s election campaign meant that he was free from blame. His manifesto involved taking a softer line on the European Union, allowing a free vote on many issues, while concentrating heavily on the economy and public services.

Davis was very much an outsider candidate, not having served on the front bench under Hague, though he had served as a junior Minister in the government of John Major. As Chairman of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in the previous Parliament he had gained a good reputation at Westminster, and his relatively unknown profile among the electorate was argued to be an asset.

Duncan Smith stood as the standard bearer of the Thatcherite wing of the party, arguing the need for the party to stick to its principles and take a hard line on the European Union, while making use of the talents of all sections of the party.

Portillo ran on a somewhat socially liberal manifesto, calling for the party to reform and reach out to groups not normally associated with the party, calling for greater involvement of women, ethnic minorities and homosexuals. His supporters, and the platform, were dubbed &quot;Portilistas&quot;. Portillo was the first candidate to declare, and many commentators saw the contest as coming down to whether or not the party agreed with him as his platform proved deeply controversial in some quarters.

===Prominent Conservatives who did not stand===
There were several prominent Conservative politicians who did not stand despite speculation by political commentators preceding the election:
*Michael Howard, the former Home Secretary, had stood in the 1997 leadership election but subsequently withdrew from frontline politics and was not at this stage widely considered. He subsequently made a comeback, however, first as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer and then as Leader from 2003.
*Francis Maude, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, had been popular with the liberal wing of the party, but after his ally Portillo returned to Parliament the lead shifted. Maude instead ran Portillo&#x27;s campaign.
*John Redwood, who had stood in both the 1995 and 1997 leadership elections, initially declined to confirm his intentions but eventually decided not to run.
*Malcolm Rifkind, the former Foreign Secretary, had been unsuccessful in his attempt to return to Parliament. Whilst the rules did not actually specify on paper that candidates had to be MPs, political realities meant that a non-MP was not a viable option. (It was because of this that Portillo did not stand in the 1997 leadership election.)
*Ann Widdecombe, the Shadow Home Secretary, took preliminary soundings but found that despite being popular among the full party membership she had limited support in the Parliamentary Party, who voted in the initial rounds. As a result, she decided not to run.

==Contest rules==
The election was conducted by the 1922 Committee, with that committee&#x27;s chairman serving as returning officer. As the outgoing chairman, Sir Archie Hamilton, had stood down from Parliament at the election, no returning officer was available for some time until Sir Michael Spicer was elected. This led to calls for the job of Returning Officer to be reallocated in future.

The rules required MPs to vote in a succession of ballots, with the lowest-scoring candidate eliminated each time, until only two candidates remained. MPs could vote for only a single candidate, but could change their vote each time.

==MPs&#x27; ballots==
The first ballot proved problematic. The party rules made no provision for a tie. As a result, Michael Spicer ordered that a fresh ballot be held the next day and declared that if the tie prevailed then both lowest-scoring candidates would be eliminated. On the second ballot, Ancram was eliminated by virtue of placing last. Davis withdrew as the difference between him and the next candidate was greater than Ancram&#x27;s votes. Both Davis and Ancram endorsed Duncan Smith. By a single vote Portillo was eliminated from the contest on the third ballot.



===Criticisms===
The MP-only stage of the contest attracted much criticism. Many questioned the validity of MPs eliminating the candidates, potentially denying the ordinary members the opportunity to vote for a favourite candidate (Ann Widdecombe declined to run because she believed she would not reach the last round). Others questioned how it could be claimed that the eventual winner could be assured of support among MPs (the argument often given for previous elections being conducted by MPs only and now for holding these initial rounds) as in the final round each had attracted the support of only a third of the Parliamentary Party. The potential for tactical voting also came in for question. On more technical grounds, the lack of provision of a tie and the delay in appointing a returning officer also sparked concerns, with the former point also leading to ridicule from political opponents.

==Membership vote==
Duncan Smith and Clarke&#x27;s names went forward to the full party membership in a three-month contest that was at times acrimonious. Both outgoing leader Hague and Margaret Thatcher endorsed Duncan Smith&#x27;s candidacy, while John Major endorsed Clarke; Edward Heath, the only other living former Conservative leader did not publicly endorse either of them, but was thought to favour Clarke.

The closing date for ballots was 11 September, but due to the September 11 attacks in the United States, the announcement of the result was delayed until 13 September. Iain Duncan Smith emerged as winner with over 60% of the vote, although without a clear majority among MPs, which many believe hampered the inexperienced leader and led to the events which saw Michael Howard replace him in 2003.

==Legacy==
In hindsight, Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s leadership was widely regarded as a disaster for the Conservatives, with the party&#x27;s poll ratings declining to under 30% at times. After just two years as leader of the Conservative Party, Duncan Smith lost a confidence vote amongst Conservative MPs and was replaced as leader by Michael Howard. Howard went on to lose the 2005 General Election, improving on William Hague&#x27;s performance in 2001 but still falling some way short of the 209 MPs Labour picked up in their disastrous 1983 campaign. Howard announced he was to resign the leadership, but first he would attempt to reform the electoral system to reduce the role for the rank-and-file party membership (he failed in this).

In the subsequent leadership election, David Cameron was elected as Conservative Party leader. Although he had failed in his own campaign, commentators have since argued that Portillo&#x27;s run in 2001 created the conditions under which his reformist agenda was able to succeed four years later. By this point, however, Portillo himself had retired from Parliament, frustrated with party politics.

Cameron returned the party to government at the 2010 general election as the head of a Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition. In this government, Duncan Smith was appointed Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and Clarke was appointed Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice. Cameron subsequently won a majority five years later at the 2015 general election.

He is the only son out of six siblings of royal spouse, the ninth Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan Tuanku Munawir and his spouse, Tunku Ampuan Durah.

Tunku Muhriz obtained a degree in law (LLB) from the University College of Wales at Aberystwyth (later known as the University of Wales, Aberystwyth).

He began his career in an international bank in Malaysia and became a director and shareholder of a company licensed as brokers in interbank foreign exchange and in the currency deposits market (1973–1986). He was the chairman and shareholder of a Malaysian joint venture with a worldwide advertising agency (1981–1992), chairman and director of a joint venture company involved in the manufacturing of building products (1995–1998) and a director and shareholder of a company engaged in electrical engineering and construction (1995–present). He has been on the board of directors of Bangkok Bank since 2006.

==Tunku Besar of Seri Menanti (1961 – 2008)==
Tuanku Muhriz was made Tunku Besar of Seri Menanti (the highest ranked of the &quot;Putera Yang Empat)&quot; in 1961, following the death of his grandfather Tunku Besar Burhanuddin. 

Tuanku Muhriz was first in the order of succession before the death of Tuanku Munawir, followed by Tunku Nasir Alam (the Tunku Laksamana), Tunku Ja&#x27;afar (the Tunku Muda Serting) and Tunku Abdullah (the Tunku Panglima Besar). When Tuanku Munawir died in 1967, Tuanku Muhriz was not chosen. Instead the council chose his half-uncle Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, a diplomat. It has been suggested that the then Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, influenced the Undangs not to choose Tuanku Muhriz on account of his youth (he was then only nineteen). However, he was bypassed by the Council of Undangs to become Yang di-Pertuan Besar when his father died in 1967 for his half-uncle, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar.

The Negeri Sembilan Constitution states that the Undangs should elect a suitable and competent ruler first from the sons of the deceased ruler, followed in order from the brothers, then paternal uncles, grandsons, brothers&#x27; sons, and paternal uncles&#x27; sons of the deceased ruler.

== Marriage ==
On 16 February 1973, the royal engagement between the Tunku Besar of Seri Menanti Tunku Muhriz who was 25 years old and the Terengganu princess Tengku Aishah Rohani, took place at the Istana Terengganu in Jalan Pekeliling, Kuala Lumpur.

At the time, Tunku Muhriz was working as a junior administrative bank officer at Bank Rakyat whilst Tengku Aishah Rohani was a clerk at a local bank in Malaysia.

On 25 April 1974, he married Tengku Aishah Rohani. Their royal marriage was held at the Istana Maziah, Kuala Terengganu and was witnessed by Tunku Muhriz&#x27;s mother, Yang Maha Mulia Tuanku Ampuan Durah along with other members of the Negeri Sembilan and Terengganu royal family.

On 4 May 1974, Yang Maha Mulia Tuanku Ampuan Durah held a royal couples&#x27; traditional departure ceremony (istiadat keberangkatan pulang pengantin diraja) at the Istana Lama Seri Menanti.

== Royal family ==
Tuanku Muhriz is married to Terengganu princess Tengku Aishah Rohani and the royal couple have three sons: Tunku Ali Redhauddin, Tunku Zain Al-&#x27;Abidin and Tunku Alif Hussein Saifuddin Al-Amin.

* His Highness Tunku Besar of Seri Menanti Tunku Ali Redhauddin was born on 26 April 1977 at University Hospital, Putrajaya.
* His Highness Tunku Zain Al-&#x27;Abidin was born on 6 July 1982 at University Hospital, Putrajaya.
* His Highness Tunku Alif Hussein Saifuddin Al-Amin was born on 3 September 1984 with lack of Vitamin K on his brain. He died on 15 January 2016 at Hospital Canselor Tuanku Muhriz following an illness. He was 31 years old. He was buried at the Seri Menanti Royal Mausoleum in Kuala Pilah.

==Yang di-Pertuan Besar (2008 – Present)==
On 29 December 2008, The Council of Undang proclaimed him as the 11th Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan succeeding Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar who had died on 27 December 2008. Many prominent Malaysians backed Tuanku Muhriz to succeed as the Ruler of Negeri Sembilan in view of his modest and dignified personality and by the fact that he had a successful corporate career. He was also the rightful heir, by tradition, to the throne on the death of his father. 

Due to having kept a low profile, Tuanku Muhriz was largely unknown outside royal circles in Negeri Sembilan. However, Tuanku Muhriz was not an underdog in the negotiations that was played out for the position of Yang di-Pertuan Besar. During the closed discussions to elect the successor to Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar, at least two, if not all four of the Undangs strongly championed his candidacy. They refused to budge when it was suggested that they consider Tunku Naquiyuddin, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar&#x27;s eldest son, instead as the next Ruler of Negeri Sembilan.

Throughout his life Tuanku Muhriz established and maintained strong ties with the Undangs, the general nobility, the lesser royalty and people of Negeri Sembilan, and more so since moving back to the state. He also has powerful backers within the political establishment in the state, with the former Menteri Besar Tan Sri Mohd Isa Abdul Samad among his supporters.

There has been a quiet campaign by his loyal supporters at state and federal level to portray him as a well-spoken and well-educated man; someone who had the great strength of character to put aside the disappointment of not being appointed Ruler of the state in 1967: and who continues to lead a dignified and respectable life.

His supporters said that in contrast to members of Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar&#x27;s family, Tuanku Muhriz shuns publicity and though he can be very progressive in his outlook, he seems more rooted in traditional ways. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar&#x27;s family were said to be completely devastated with the decision of the Undangs to select Tuanku Muhriz over Tunku Naquiyuddin. They too had several powerful politicians in their camp but the Undangs were not to be swayed.

== Colonel in Chief ==
Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan Tuanku Muhriz is the Colonel in Chief of Royal Signals Regiment (Malaysia) and Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer (Malaysia).

<doc id="598386" wikidata="Q365682" url="?curid=598386" title="Gordon Parks">
<text>Gordon Roger Alexander Buchanan Parks (November 30, 1912 – March 7, 2006) was an American photographer, composer, author, poet, and filmmaker, who became prominent in U.S. documentary photojournalism in the 1940s through 1970s—particularly in issues of civil rights, poverty and African Americans—and in glamour photography. He is best remembered for his iconic photos of poor Americans during the 1940s (taken for a federal government project), for his photographic essays for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and as the director of the films &quot;Shaft, Shaft&#x27;s Big Score&quot; and the semiautobiographical &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;.

Parks was one of the first black American filmmakers to direct films within the Hollywood system, developing films relating the experience of slaves and struggling black Americans, and helping create the &quot;blaxploitation&quot; genre. The National Film Registry cites &quot;The Learning Tree&quot; as &quot;the first feature film by a black director to be financed by a major Hollywood studio.&quot;

==Early life==
Parks was born in Fort Scott, Kansas, the son of Andrew Jackson Parks and Sarah Ross, on November 30, 1912. He was the youngest of 15 children. His father was a farmer who grew corn, beets, turnips, potatoes, collard greens, and tomatoes. They also had a few ducks, chickens, and hogs.

He attended a segregated elementary school. His high school had both black people and white people, because the town was too small for segregated high schools, but black students were not allowed to play sports or attend school social activities, and they were discouraged from developing aspirations for higher education. Parks related in a documentary on his life that his teacher told him that his desire to go to college would be a waste of money.

When Parks was 11 years old, three white boys threw him into the Marmaton River, believing he couldn&#x27;t swim. He had the presence of mind to duck underwater so they wouldn&#x27;t see him make it to land. His mother died when he was fourteen. He spent his last night at the family home sleeping beside his mother&#x27;s coffin, seeking not only solace, but a way to face his own fear of death.

Soon after, he was sent to St. Paul, Minnesota, to live with his sister and her husband. He and his brother-in-law argued frequently and Parks was finally turned out onto the street to fend for himself at the age of 15. Struggling to survive, he worked in brothels, and as a singer, piano player, bus boy, traveling waiter, and semi-pro basketball player. In 1929, he briefly worked in an elite gentlemen&#x27;s club, the Minnesota Club. There he observed the trappings of success and was able to read many books from the club library. When the Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought an end to the club, he jumped a train to Chicago, where he managed to land a job in a flophouse.

==Career==
Photography

At the age of twenty-eight, Parks was struck by photographs of migrant workers in a magazine. He bought his first camera, a Voigtländer Brillant, for $12.50 at a Seattle, Washington, pawnshop and taught himself how to take photos. The photography clerks who developed Parks&#x27;s first roll of film applauded his work and prompted him to seek a fashion assignment at a women&#x27;s clothing store in St. Paul, Minnesota, owned by Frank Murphy. Those photographs caught the eye of Marva Louis, wife of heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis. She encouraged Parks and his wife, Sally Alvis, to move to Chicago in 1940, where he began a portrait business and specialized in photographs of society women. Parks&#x27;s photographic work in Chicago, especially in capturing the myriad experiences of African Americans across the city, led him to receive the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship, in 1942, paying him $200 a month and offering him his choice of employer, which, in turn, contributed to being asked to join the Farm Security Administration (FSA), which was chronicling the nation&#x27;s social conditions, under the auspice of Roy Stryker.

Government photography

Over the next few years, Parks moved from job to job, developing a freelance portrait and fashion photographer sideline. He began to chronicle the city&#x27;s South Side black ghetto and, in 1941, an exhibition of those photographs won Parks a photography fellowship with the FSA.

Working at the FSA as a trainee under Roy Stryker, Parks created one of his best-known photographs, &quot;American Gothic, Washington, D.C.&quot;, named after the iconic Grant Wood painting &quot;American Gothic&quot;—a legendary painting of a traditional, stoic, white American farmer and daughter—which bore a striking, but ironic, resemblance to the Parks photograph of a black menial laborer. Parks&#x27;s &quot;haunting&quot; photograph shows a black woman, Ella Watson, who worked on the cleaning crew of the FSA building, standing stiffly in front of an American flag hanging on the wall, a broom in one hand and a mop in the background. Parks had been inspired to create the image after encountering racism repeatedly in restaurants and shops in the segregated capital city.

Upon viewing the photograph, Stryker said that it was an indictment of America, and that it could get all of his photographers fired. He urged Parks to keep working with Watson, which led to a series of photographs of her daily life. Parks said later that his first image was overdone and not subtle; other commentators have argued that it drew strength from its polemical nature and its duality of victim and survivor, and thus affected far more people than his subsequent pictures of Mrs. Watson.

(Parks&#x27;s overall body of work for the federal government—using his camera &quot;as a weapon&quot;—would draw far more attention from contemporaries and historians than that of all other black photographers in federal service at the time. Today, most historians reviewing federally commissioned black photographers of that era focus almost exclusively on Parks.)

After the FSA disbanded, Parks remained in Washington, D.C., as a correspondent with the Office of War Information, where he photographed the all-black 332d Fighter Group, known as the Tuskegee Airmen. He was unable to follow the group in the overseas war theatre, so he resigned from the O.W.I. He would later follow Stryker to the Standard Oil Photography Project in New Jersey, which assigned photographers to take pictures of small towns and industrial centers. The most striking work by Parks during that period included, &quot;Dinner Time at Mr. Hercules Brown&#x27;s Home, Somerville, Maine&quot; (1944); &quot;Grease Plant Worker, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&quot; (1946); &quot;Car Loaded with Furniture on Highway&quot; (1945); &quot;Self Portrait&quot; (1945); and &quot;Ferry Commuters, Staten Island, N.Y.&quot; (1946).

Commercial and civic photography

Parks renewed his search for photography jobs in the fashion world. Following his resignation from the Office of War Information, Parks moved to Harlem and became a freelance fashion photographer for &quot;Vogue&quot; under the editorship of Alexander Liberman. Despite racist attitudes of the day, &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Liberman hired him to shoot a collection of evening gowns. As Parks photographed fashion for &quot;Vogue&quot; over the next few years, he developed the distinctive style of photographing his models in motion rather than in static poses. During this time, he published his first two books, &quot;Flash Photography&quot; (1947) and &quot;Camera Portraits: Techniques and Principles of Documentary Portraiture&quot; (1948).

A 1948 photographic essay on a young Harlem gang leader won Parks a staff job as a photographer and writer with America&#x27;s leading photo-magazine, &quot;Life&quot;. His involvement with &quot;Life&quot; would last until 1972. For over 20 years, Parks produced photographs on subjects including fashion, sports, Broadway, poverty, and racial segregation, as well as portraits of Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, Muhammad Ali, and Barbra Streisand. He became &quot;one of the most provocative and celebrated photojournalists in the United States.&quot;

His photographs for &quot;Life&quot; magazine, namely his 1956 photo essay, titled &quot;The Restraints: Open and Hidden,&quot; illuminated the effects of racial segregation while simultaneously following the everyday lives and activities of three families in and near Mobile, Alabama: the Thorntons, Causeys, and Tanners. As curators at the High Museum of Art Atlanta note, while the photo essay by Parks served as decisive documentation of the Jim Crow South and all of its effects, he did not simply focus on demonstrations, boycotts, and brutality that were associated with that period; instead, he &quot;emphasized the prosaic details&quot; of the lives of several families.

An exhibition of photographs from a 1950 project Parks completed for &quot;Life&quot; was exhibited in 2015 at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Parks returned to his hometown, Fort Scott, Kansas, where segregation persisted, and he documented conditions in the community and the contemporary lives of many of his 11 classmates from the segregated middle school they attended. The project included his commentary, but the work was never published by &quot;Life&quot;.

During his years with &quot;Life&quot;, Parks also wrote a few books on the subject of photography (particularly documentary photography), and in 1960 was named Photographer of the Year by the American Society of Magazine Photographers.

His fashion photography continued to be published in &quot;Vogue&quot; from the mid 1940s to the late 1970s.

===Film===
In the 1950s, Parks worked as a consultant on various Hollywood productions. He later directed a series of documentaries on black ghetto life that were commissioned by National Educational Television. With his film adaptation of his semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;, in 1969 for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. It was filmed in his home town of Fort Scott, Kansas. Parks also wrote the screenplay and composed the musical score for the film, with assistance from his friend, the composer Henry Brant.

&quot;Shaft&quot;, a 1971 detective film directed by Parks and starring Richard Roundtree as John Shaft, became a major hit that spawned a series of films that would be labeled as &quot;blaxploitation&quot;. The blaxploitation genre was one in which images of lower-class blacks being involved with drugs, violence and women, were exploited for commercially successful films featuring black actors, and was popular with a section of the black community. Parks&#x27;s feel for settings was confirmed by &quot;Shaft&quot;, with its portrayal of the super-cool leather-clad, black private detective hired to find the kidnapped daughter of a Harlem racketeer.

Parks also directed the 1972 sequel, &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score&quot;, in which the protagonist finds himself caught in the middle of rival gangs of racketeers. Parks&#x27;s other directorial credits include &quot;The Super Cops&quot; (1974) and &quot;Leadbelly&quot; (1976), a biographical film of the blues musician Huddie Ledbetter. In the 1980s, he made several films for television and composed the music and a libretto for &quot;Martin&quot;, a ballet tribute to Martin Luther King Jr., which premiered in Washington, D.C., during 1989. It was screened on national television on King&#x27;s birthday in 1990.

In 2000, as an homage, he had a cameo appearance in the &quot;Shaft&quot; sequel that starred Samuel L. Jackson in the title role as the namesake and nephew of the original John Shaft. In the cameo scene, Parks was sitting playing chess when Jackson greeted him as, &quot;Mr. P.&quot;

===Musician and composer===
His first job was as a piano player in a brothel when he was a teenager. Parks also performed as a jazz pianist. His song &quot;No Love&quot;, composed in another brothel, was performed during a national radio broadcast by Larry Funk and his orchestra in the early 1930s.

Parks composed &quot;Concerto for Piano and Orchestra&quot; (1953) at the encouragement of black American conductor Dean Dixon and Dixon&#x27;s wife Vivian, a pianist, and with the help of the composer Henry Brant. He completed &quot;Tree Symphony&quot; in 1967. In 1989, he composed and directed &quot;Martin&quot;, a ballet dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr., the civil-rights leader, who had been assassinated.

===Writing===
In the late-1940s, Parks began writing books on the art and craft of photography. This second career would produce 15 books and lead to his role as a prominent black filmmaker. His semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Learning Tree&quot; was published in 1963. He authored several books of poetry, which he illustrated with his own photographs, and he wrote three volumes of memoirs: &quot;A Choice of Weapons&quot; (1966), &quot;Voices in the Mirror&quot; (1990), and &quot;A Hungry Heart&quot; (2005).

In 1981, Parks turned to fiction with &quot;Shannon&quot;, a novel about Irish immigrants fighting their way up the social ladder in turbulent early 20th-century New York. Parks&#x27;s writing accomplishments include novels, poetry, autobiography, and non-fiction, including both photographic instructional manuals and books about filmmaking.

===Painting===
Parks&#x27;s photography-related abstract oil paintings were showcased in a 1981 exhibition at Alex Rosenberg Gallery in New York titled &quot;Gordon Parks: Expansions: The Aesthetic Blend of Painting and Photography.&quot;

===&quot;Essence&quot; magazine===
In 1970, Parks helped found &quot;Essence&quot; magazine, and served as its editorial director during the first three years of its circulation.

==Personal life==
Parks was married and divorced three times. His first two wives, comprising almost 40 years of marriage, were Black. He married Sally Alvis in Minneapolis in 1933 and they divorced in 1961, after more than 25 years. In 1962, he married Elizabeth Campbell, daughter of cartoonist E. Simms Campbell, and they divorced in 1973. Parks first met Chinese-American editor Genevieve Young (stepdaughter of Chinese diplomat Wellington Koo) in 1962 when he began writing &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;. At that time, his publisher assigned her to be his editor. They became romantically involved at a time when they both were divorcing previous spouses, and married in 1973. This was his shortest marriage, lasting only six years. It ended in divorce in 1979. Parks was in a long term relationship with Gloria Vanderbilt until his death in 2006.

Parks had four children by his first two wives: Gordon, Jr., David, Leslie, and Toni (Parks-Parsons). His oldest son Gordon Parks, Jr., whose talents resembled his father&#x27;s, was killed in a plane crash in 1979 in Kenya, where he had gone to direct a film. David is an author, with his first book, &quot;GI Diary&quot;, published in 1968. The book is included in the Howard University Press Classic Editions, Library of African American Literature and Criticism.

Parks was a longtime resident of Greenburgh, New York in Westchester County, New York, and his house was landmarked in 2007.

Parks has five grandchildren: Alain, Gordon III, Sarah, Campbell, and Satchel. Malcolm X honored Parks when he asked him to be the godfather of his daughter, Qubilah Shabazz.

== Legacy ==
=== In film ===
With his 1971 film &quot;Shaft&quot; (along with Melvin Van Peebles&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot;, released earlier the same year), Parks co-created the genre of blaxploitation, an ethnic subgenre of the exploitation film that emerged in the United States during the early 1970s. The action film also helped to alter Hollywood&#x27;s view of African Americans, introducing the black action hero into mainstream cinema.

Director Spike Lee cites Parks as an inspiration, stating &quot;You get inspiration where it comes from. It doesn&#x27;t have to be because I&#x27;m looking at his films. The odds that he got these films made under, when there were no black directors, is enough.&quot;

The &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character Gordon was named after Parks.

=== In music ===
*One of Parks&#x27; photographs, &quot;1956 Alabama&quot;, is used for the album cover of Common&#x27;s &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;. It is a photo of a young black woman in Alabama, dressed for church, and drinking from a &quot;colored only&quot; drinking fountain.
*Parks is referenced in Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s music video for his song &quot;ELEMENT.&quot;. In the video, some of Parks&#x27;s iconic photographs are transformed into moving vignettes.

==Preservation and archives==
Several parties are recipients or heirs of different parts of Parks&#x27;s archival record.

The Gordon Parks Foundation

The Gordon Parks Foundation in Pleasantville, New York (formerly in Chappaqua, New York) reports that it &quot;permanently preserves the work of Gordon Parks, makes it available to the public through exhibitions, books, and electronic media.&quot; The organization also says it &quot;supports artistic and educational activities that advance what Gordon described as &#x27;the common search for a better life and a better world.&#x27;&quot; That support includes scholarships for &quot;artistic&quot; students, and assistance to researchers. Their headquarters includes an exhibition space with rotating photography exhibits, open free to the public, with guided group tours available by arrangement. The foundation admits &quot;qualified researchers&quot; to their archive, by appointment. The foundation collaborates with other organizations and institutions, nationally and internationally, to advance its aims.

The Gordon Parks Museum/Center

The Gordon Parks Museum/Center in Fort Scott, Kansas, holds dozens of Parks&#x27;s photos and various belongings, both given to the museum by Parks, and bequeathed to the museum by him upon his death. The collection includes &quot;awards and medals, personal photos, paintings and drawings of Gordon, plaques, certificates, diplomas and honorary doctorates, selected books and articles, clothing, record player, tennis racquet, magazine articles, his collection of Life magazines and much more.&quot; The museum has also separately received some of Parks&#x27;s cameras, writing desk and photos of him.

Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.

The Library of Congress (LOC) reports that, in 1995, it &quot;acquired Parks&#x27; personal collection, including papers, music, photographs, films, recordings, drawings and other products of his... career.&quot;

The LOC was already home to a federal archive that included Parks&#x27;s first major photojournalism projects—photographs he produced for the Farm Security Administration (1942–43), and for the Office of War Information (1943–45).

In April 2000, the LOC awarded Parks its accolade &quot;Living Legend&quot;, one of only 26 writers and artists so honored by the LOC. The LOC also holds Parks&#x27;s published and unpublished scores, and several of his films and television productions.

National Film Registry

Parks&#x27;s autobiographical motion picture, &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;, and his African-American anti-hero action-drama &quot;Shaft&quot;, are both permanently preserved as part of the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. &quot;The Learning Tree&quot; was one of the original group of 25 films first selected by the LOC for the National Film Registry.

National Archives, Washington, D.C.

The National Archives hold the film &quot;My Father, Gordon Parks&quot; (1969: archive 306.8063), a film about Parks and his production of his autobiographical motion picture, &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;, along with a print (from the original) of &quot;Solomon Northup&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, a film made by Parks for a Public Broadcasting System telecast about the ordeal of a slave. The Archives also hold various photos from Parks&#x27;s years in government service.

Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.

The Smithsonian Institution has an extensive list of holdings related to Parks, particularly photos.

Wichita State University

In 1991, Wichita State University (WSU), in Wichita, the largest city in Parks&#x27;s home state of Kansas, awarded him its highest honor for achievement: the President&#x27;s Medal. However, in the mid-1990s, after Parks entrusted WSU with a collection of 150 of his famous photos, WSU—for various reasons (including confusion as to whether they were a gift or loan, and whether the university could adequately protect and preserve them)—returned them, stunning and deeply upsetting Parks. A further snub came from Wichita&#x27;s city officials, who also declined the opportunity to acquire many of his papers and photos.

By 2000, however, WSU and Parks had healed their division. The university resumed honoring Parks and accumulating his work. In 2008, the Gordon Parks Foundation selected WSU as repository for 140 boxes of his photos, manuscripts, letters and other papers. In 2014, another 125 of his photos were acquired from the foundation by WSU, with help from Wichita philanthropists Paula and Barry Downing, for display at the university&#x27;s Ulrich Museum of Art.

Kansas State University

The Gordon Parks Collection in the Richard L. D. and Marjorie J. Morse Department Special Collections at Kansas State University primarily documents the creation of his film &quot;The Learning Tree&quot;. The Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art at Kansas State University holds a collection of 204 Gordon Parks photographs as well as artist files and artwork documentation. This collection is made up of 128 photographs that were chosen and gifted by Parks in 1973 to K-State, after receiving an honorary doctor of letters degree from the university in 1970. The gift included black and white images printed from negatives made between 1949 and 1970 and stored in the LIFE magazine archives; the donation also included color photographs printed from negatives in the artist&#x27;s private collection. The K-State gift is the first known set of photographs specifically selected by Parks for a public institution. The collection also includes a group of 73 photographs printed after two residences by Parks in Manhattan, Kansas. Parks first returned for a residency in 1984, sponsored by the local newspaper The Manhattan Mercury for its centennial; he returned for another in 1985, initiated by the Manhattan Arts Council and sponsored by the city and various community organizations and individuals. Seventy-three photographs printed after these visits were transferred from the Manhattan Arts Center to K-State in 2017. The photographs are of locations in and around Manhattan, including churches and historic homes and K-State architecture and students.

<text>Lake Elgygytgyn, also transcripted El&#x27;gygytgyn, (Russian and Chukchi: Эльгыгытгын) is a crater lake in Anadyrsky District, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in northeast Siberia, about southeast of Chaunskaya Bay.

The word &quot;Elgygytgyn&quot; means &quot;white lake&quot; in the Chukchi language.

The lake is of particular interest to scientists because it has never been covered by glaciers. This has allowed the uninterrupted build-up of of sediment at the bottom of the lake, recording information on prehistoric climate change.

==Geography==

Lake Elgygytgyn is an impact crater lake located in the Anadyr Plateau, part of the Anadyr Highlands. It is drained to the southeast by the Enmyvaam, a tributary of the Belaya. It is approximately in diameter and has a maximum depth of . The lake is centered within an impact crater with a rim diameter of that formed 3.6 million years ago during the Pliocene. Before it was reliably dated, preliminary papers in the late 1970s suggested either Elgygytgyn or Zhamanshin as the source of the young Australasian strewnfield.

== Scientific drilling ==
In late 2008 and early 2009, an international team conducted a drilling program targeting three holes in Elgygytgyn Lake. The resulting cores are designated ICPD Site 5011-1 and 5011-3.

==Fauna==
The conditions in Elgygytgyn lake are extremely severe for fish life, being classed as an ultra-oligotrophic lake and the surface covered by ice for around 10 months of the year. Even so, there are three species permanently inhabiting the lake&#x27;s harsh aquatic environment, all species of char. These are &quot;Salvelinus boganidae&quot; (Boganid Char), &quot;S. elgyticus&quot; (Small-mouth Char) and &quot;Salvethymus svetovidovi&quot; (Long-finned Char). The two latter species are endemic to the Elgygytgyn lake. All three species are adapted to the lake&#x27;s extremely cold waters, which are generally just above the freezing point, and spend most of the year in total darkness. It may start to melt in the summer, but some years it never fully thaws. The lake is also home to more than a dozen endemic diatoms.

<doc id="598397" wikidata="Q858724" url="?curid=598397" title="Shaun of the Dead">
<text>Shaun of the Dead is a 2004 zombie comedy film directed by Edgar Wright and written by Wright and Simon Pegg. Pegg stars as Shaun, a downtrodden London salesman who is caught alongside his loved ones in a zombie apocalypse. It also stars Nick Frost in his film debut, Kate Ashfield, Lucy Davis, Dylan Moran, Bill Nighy, and Penelope Wilton. It is the first film in Wright and Pegg&#x27;s &quot;Three Flavours Cornetto&quot; trilogy, followed by &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007) and &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot; (2013).

&quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; was inspired by ideas Pegg and Wright used for their 1999-2001 television sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot;, particularly an episode in which Pegg&#x27;s character hallucinates a zombie invasion. The film references the &quot;Night of the Living&quot; &quot;Dead&quot; films by George A. Romero. Principal photography took place across London and at Ealing Studios for nine weeks between May and June 2003.

&quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; premiered in London on 29 March 2004, before it was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2004 and in the United States on 24 September. It was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, grossing $38.7 million worldwide on a budget of $6.1 million and receiving two nominations at the British Academy Film Awards. It was ranked third on the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films and quickly acquired a cult following. In film studies, it is seen as a product of post-9/11 anxiety and a model for transnational comedy, while the zombie outbreak as depicted in the film has been used as a modelling example for disease control.

== Plot ==

In the Crouch End area of London, 29-year-old electronics salesman Shaun is disrespected by his colleagues, does not get along with his stepfather Philip, and is dumped by his girlfriend Liz after he promises to improve himself but is unsuccessful in making decent plans for an anniversary date. At his favourite pub, the Winchester, a heartbroken Shaun gets drunk with his slacker best friend Ed. At home, Shaun and Ed&#x27;s roommate Pete complains of a bite wound from a mugger and berates Shaun, telling him to stop leaning on Ed and get his life together.

The following day, a zombie apocalypse has overwhelmed London. Shaun and Ed do not notice until they encounter two zombies in their garden, whom they beat to death after throwing household implements and Shaun&#x27;s record collection at them. They devise a plan to rescue Shaun&#x27;s mother, Barbara, and Liz, and then wait out the crisis at the Winchester. They escape from a now-zombified Pete by stealing his car. They pick up Philip, who has been bitten, and Barbara. Ed deliberately crashes Pete&#x27;s car so he can drive Philip&#x27;s Jaguar Series 3. They fetch Liz and her flatmates David and Dianne. Philip reconciles with Shaun before becoming a zombie.

Forced to abandon the car and their weapons, they sneak through the neighbourhood and briefly encounter a group led by Shaun&#x27;s friend Yvonne, with each group member resembling a doppelgänger of the other group&#x27;s members. Shaun defends Barbara from a zombie and impales it with a swingball pole. After imitating zombies to bypass a horde and reach the Winchester, Shaun and Ed argue when Ed answers his mobile phone, attracting the zombies&#x27; attention. David panics and breaks a window of the Winchester, forcing Shaun to lure the horde away using himself as bait before returning.

As the group takes refuge inside the Winchester, Shaun discovers that the zombies followed him, and Ed inadvertently attracts them by playing on the pub&#x27;s slot machine. While fighting the pub&#x27;s zombified owner, Shaun discovers that the Winchester rifle above the bar is functional, which he had previously debated with Ed. Barbara reveals she was bitten and dies after giving Liz and Shaun&#x27;s relationship her approval. David attempts to shoot Barbara, but Shaun stops him, accusing David of hating him and being in love with Liz. David denies this, but Dianne admits she knows it is true. Barbara becomes a zombie, forcing a distraught Shaun to shoot her, and further fighting with David ensues.

The zombies break through a window of the pub and pull David out, devouring him alive. In a foolish and senseless attempt to save the doomed David, Dianne opens the doors to the pub and rushes into the horde of zombies using David&#x27;s severed leg as a weapon. With the doors now open, zombies pour into the bar. The zombified Pete reappears in the horde and is shot by Shaun after biting Ed. Shaun, Liz, and Ed take cover behind the bar; Shaun sets the bar on fire with alcohol to serve as a barrier. The three take refuge in the cellar, where they realise they only have two bullets left. Shaun and Liz contemplate suicide while Ed volunteers to sacrifice himself. Upon discovering a small lift for kegs that opens onto the street, Shaun and Liz exit the pub while Ed buys them time by staying behind with the rifle. Yvonne arrives with the British Army, who gun down the zombies before taking Shaun and Liz to safety.

Six months later, civilisation has returned to normal but with the added bonus that the surviving zombies are now used for free labour and entertainment. Liz has moved in with Shaun, who keeps the now-zombified Ed chained up in his garden shed, revealing that Ed is still at least somewhat sentient; the two play video games together in the shed.

== Cast ==

In uncredited performances, Mark Gatiss, David Walliams and Krishnan Guru-Murthy appear as news reporters, while Chris Martin, Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Gareth Jennings, Mark Donovan and Michael Smiley appear as zombies.

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; was inspired by &quot;Art&quot;, an episode of Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot;. Written by Pegg and Jessica Hynes and directed by Wright, the episode involves Pegg&#x27;s character hallucinating a zombie invasion after playing the video game &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; while under the influence of amphetamine.

With a mutual appreciation for George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dead&quot; trilogy of zombie films, Pegg and Wright decided to write their own zombie film. In late 1999, they conceived and pitched the film to Film4, who took it on until their production budget was cut back. Despite this, Wright was still invested in the production and refused to take other television directing jobs until &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; was made, which left him in some debt for a while. According to Wright, other companies passed on it because &quot;they weren&#x27;t sure what the tone was and said it wasn&#x27;t all that scary and not that funny. They didn&#x27;t get it.&quot; After eighteen months, Working Title Films picked the project up, which Wright felt was ironic as the film mocks the classic British rom-coms that Working Title produces. The film was first announced at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.

Wright has said that he came up with the film while riding in a cab with Pegg after the excitement of filming the zombie episode in &quot;Spaced&quot;, and while watching a horror film with both Pegg and Nick Frost. He began developing it in earnest after playing &quot;Resident Evil&quot; one late night himself and then going out in the early morning hours, wondering what a British person&#x27;s reaction to a zombie apocalypse would be. He considered the lack of firearms typical of American zombie movies, and his experience of the dazed early morning walk to the shop turned into a scene in the film where Shaun does the same thing. Another influence from Wright&#x27;s life came from how he missed the 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic by simply not having paid attention to the news for a fortnight and turning his television on one day to see cattle being burnt, which left him confused. Due to this, Wright said &quot;it&#x27;s plausible that the world could be ending and these two guys could be the last to know&quot; as they also skip over the news on television in the film. The idea of Shaun and Ed spending their time at the Winchester was also inspired by their actors&#x27; lives, as Pegg and Frost &quot;always used to go to the same bar all the time&quot; according to Wright, who had been trying to convince them not to.

Wright and Pegg wrote the screenplay in eight weeks. They were inspired by films including &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968) and &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978), as well as &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985), &quot;Braindead&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963). The actors met three weeks before filming began for read-throughs, where they also made changes to the script. According to Pegg, the script has a set structure, with certain lines and actions being repeated throughout the film, making improvisation harder. Only two scenes were improvised, which include when Ed begins to describe the people at the pub and when Shaun offers the group some peanuts. Pegg said that the screenplay played well into being an actor in the film because he &quot;could write to [his] own strengths&quot; and create his own wish fulfilment.

===Casting===
The film&#x27;s cast features several British comedians, comedy actors and sitcom stars, most prominently from &quot;Spaced&quot;, &quot;Black Books&quot; and &quot;The Office&quot;, and co-stars other actors from the same shows. Cast members from them include Pegg, Frost, Stevenson, and Peter Serafinowicz. Frost met Pegg when he was working as a waiter and was brought aboard &quot;Spaced&quot; despite a lack of acting experience; Frost explained that Shaun and Ed have a dynamic similar to that of Simon and himself in real life, as they had been living together for years.

The filmmakers originally approached Helen Mirren to play Shaun&#x27;s mother, Barbara, which she turned down with a note that she would rather play other funnier characters. The role of Barbara ultimately went to Penelope Wilton, who was asked to take on the role because of her work in the 1984-89 sitcom &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot;. Shaun&#x27;s stepfather Philip is played by Bill Nighy, who accepted the role after Wright sent him an early script of the film to read.

====Cameos and extras====
Secondary roles and cameos include Martin Freeman, Tamsin Greig, Julia Deakin and Reece Shearsmith. The voices of Mark Gatiss and Julia Davis can be heard as radio news presenters; Trisha Goddard also makes a cameo appearance, hosting two fictionalised episodes of her real-life talk show &quot;Trisha&quot;. Many other comics and comic actors appear in cameos as zombies, including Rob Brydon, Paul Putner, Pamela Kempthorne, Joe Cornish, Antonia Campbell-Hughes, Mark Donovan and Michael Smiley. Coldplay members Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland also have cameo roles in the film; Martin is a close friend of Pegg, who is the godfather of Martin&#x27;s daughter, and also contributed to the soundtrack by guest singing the cover of Buzzcocks&#x27; &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Happy Nowadays&quot; with Ash. He does not appear as a zombie, but as himself in a charity drive.

Zombie extras were recruited from &quot;Spaced&quot; fan communities. Wright revealed in 2020 that &quot;[the] zombies spent a week cooped up on set. They had to stand outside The Winchester, the pub where our heroes take refuge, banging on the windows and not doing much else really. When we eventually involved them properly, they had this electric energy: a pure, crazed hysteria.&quot; Originally, there were forty stunt performers hired to be the zombies, but when the production realised that they would need a lot more to fill the set pieces, many fans responded to the online call that auditions to select zombies were set up. There were over 150 zombie extras until local children saw the zombie makeup and wanted to be involved, leading to another fifty child zombies being added.

===Filming===

The film was shot over nine weeks in London, both on location and at Ealing Studios, between May and July 2003. Wright uses in-camera transitions, typical to his style, to enable powerful visual storytelling. Pegg also commented on the use of a magical realism style, which he says is part of Wright&#x27;s direction.

Many exterior shots were filmed in and around the North London areas of Crouch End (where the film is set), Highgate, Finsbury Park and East Finchley. The electrical appliance shop that Shaun works at is a real shop located in North Finchley. The scenes filmed in and around the Winchester pub were shot at the Duke of Albany pub in New Cross, South London. The three-storey Victorian pub was closed and turned into flats in 2008.

===Music===
The film score by Pete Woodhead and Daniel Mudford is a pastiche of Italian zombie film soundtracks by Goblin and Fabio Frizzi. It also uses many musical cues from the original &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; that were originally taken by George A. Romero from the De Wolfe production music library. A friend of the assistant editor on the film had been compiling music library tracks from zombie films, making finding some music for the film much easier. Before production began on the film, Wright and Pegg had created a mixtape of songs they wanted to use. The Goblin music, though, was used as a temp track by Wright in editing; he liked the feel of it so much they decided to get the clearance to use it.

Bobby Olivier of &quot;Billboard&quot; attributes the initial rebirth of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; to its appearance in the film, which &quot;introduced it to a new generation of listeners&quot;, saying: &quot;Perhaps the most famous scene from &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; features &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot; which blares from a pub jukebox while stars Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Kate Ashfield bash a zombie with pool cues to the song&#x27;s hurtling beat&quot;. The moment had been Wright&#x27;s idea, as he loves Queen and &quot;had the idea of playing Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now – one of the most positive, exciting, happy tunes ever – over a scene of extreme violence&quot;. Pegg explained that the fight in the pub was choreographed to the song even before it had been cleared to be used in the film, so they wrote to Brian May and begged to use it.

The other choreographed sequence, near the start of the film, used different music than that which it had been set to. The original was a Cornelius song, and had been the track written in for the scene from the screenplay. Wright then heard the song used in the film, &quot;The Blue Wrath&quot; by I Monster, when editing and felt that it worked better. The tempo of both songs is the same, so the new song fit the original choreography.

== Release ==
The film was distributed by United International Pictures (UIP) in the United Kingdom (UK) and Universal Pictures in the United States and Canada, as well as other international markets. Universal Pictures also distributed Zack Snyder&#x27;s remake of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; at that time, and only took on &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; after setting the condition that they would market and release it two weeks after the release of Snyder&#x27;s film.

=== Marketing ===
UIP created a heavy targeted marketing strategy in the UK, including hiring actors to play zombies and dropping them around London to create disruption shortly before the film&#x27;s release. ZenithOptimedia ran this part of the campaign; their head said that &quot;It has to be the most powerful way to communicate what &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; is all about&quot;.

Beyond traditional print advertising, posters were also placed in the London Underground. As the poster depicted Shaun crammed tightly against train windows surrounded by zombies, the company chose to buy up poster spaces that &quot;would give the impression to anyone walking through the tunnels between platforms that the zombie carriages were on the tracks&quot;; this is a tactic that UIP had not done before, but the creative angle of the posters&#x27; positioning naturally lent itself to such a move. A similar tactic was used with digital posters for the film at an international football match between England and Sweden; less-restrictive advertising laws in Sweden, where the game was held, meant that UIP had &quot;hoardings incorporating flailing zombie-like arms&quot;, which would not have been permitted in England.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on VHS and DVD shortly after its theatrical run in the US, with a VHS and DVD release on 6 September 2004 in the UK and around December 2004 in the US, in widescreen-only for both formats. Features included several audio commentaries, EPK featurettes about the film&#x27;s production, pre-production video diaries and concept videos, photo galleries, bloopers, and more. The film also saw release on the HD DVD format in 2007 and UMD, with a Blu-ray Disc release following in 2009.

The Blu-ray release had high-definition visuals and a 5.1 surround sound audio mix. Special features include four audio commentaries, the DVD features, and U-Control features giving access to &quot;storyboards, missing bits, and of course the Zomb-O-Meter trivia track&quot;.

=== Comic adaptations and other media ===
Pegg and Wright scripted a one-off tie-in comic strip for the British comic magazine &quot;2000 AD&quot; titled &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;. Set the day before the zombie outbreak, the strip follows and expands on the character of Mary, who appears briefly in the introductory credits and is the first zombie whom Shaun and Ed are aware of; the strip details how she became a zombie. The strip was made available on the DVD release of &quot;Shaun&quot;, along with two other strips that wrapped up plotholes in the film, like how Dianne escaped and survived the Winchester incident and Ed&#x27;s fate after taking refuge in the pub&#x27;s basement. The comics, which feature Pegg and Wright&#x27;s voices on the DVD and are in black and white, were drawn by Oscar Wright, a graphic artist and Edgar Wright&#x27;s brother. In 2005, IDW Publishing released a four-issue adaptation written by Chris Ryall (with input from Edgar Wright &amp; Simon Pegg) and drawn by Zack Howard. The comic also contains scenes that were left out of the film.

In 2006, the National Entertainment Collectibles Association announced that it would produce action figures based on the film. Upper Deck Entertainment released a card for the popular &quot;World of Warcraft TCG&quot; in 2007, an ally named &quot;Shawn of the Dead&quot;, with the power of bringing back allies from the enemy graveyard. Pegg and Frost reprised their roles as Shaun and Ed for a public service announcement video, &quot;The Plan&quot;, which was released on 19 March 2020 on YouTube. In the video, Shaun and Ed share advice about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with the former urging the latter to follow National Health Service guidelines, stay home and avoid the pub.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; contains many references to Romero&#x27;s films &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and particularly &quot;Day of the Dead.&quot; The name &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; is a pun on &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;. A hand-in-mouth theoretical sequel, &quot;From Dusk Till Shaun&quot;, was discussed by Wright and Pegg, referencing &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;, as was a parallel sequel starring Stevenson called &quot;Yvonne of the Dead&quot;. A poster was made for &quot;From Dusk Till Shaun&quot; to feature in the alternate universe Times Square in the 2018 animated Sony Pictures Marvel Comics film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;; a co-director of this film, Rodney Rothman, had reached out to Wright to ask for a film suggestion that he could have theoretically made in the alternate universe.

Other zombie film references include one to &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, made during the ending scene when Shaun and Liz are watching television and a news report mentions the idea of &quot;raging infected monkeys&quot; – in &quot;28 Days Later&quot; the rage virus was started by monkeys in a laboratory – and another to Italian gore director Lucio Fulci with the restaurant called &quot;Fulci&#x27;s&quot;. The film was the first instalment of Wright and Pegg&#x27;s &quot;Three Flavours Cornetto&quot; trilogy, in which each film makes a passing reference to a different flavour of Cornetto ice cream; &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; features red strawberry-flavoured ice cream, signifying the film&#x27;s bloody and gory elements. The Cornetto was included as Ed&#x27;s hangover cure because it is Wright&#x27;s actual hangover cure.

Wright and Pegg had contacted various artists to ask for the use of their records in the famed scene where Shaun and Ed throw LPs at a zombie to defend themselves. While some artists never got back, Wright said that &quot;Sade was the coolest. She said we could trash &quot;Diamond Life&quot; without hesitation&quot;. Wright would later include a Sade song in the soundtrack of his 2010 film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; – the Beachwood Sparks version of &quot;By Your Side&quot;. It was on an original list of songs for the &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; graphic novel, and Wright joked that &quot;he owed Sade some publishing money&quot; after destroying the album in &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;. Of the moment, Pegg said that they &quot;love using Sade as a weapon&quot;, noting that she was one of only two artists who gave permission to show cover art in the scene (the other being New Order).

Besides the short &quot;The Plan&quot; being made during the COVID-19 pandemic, the film saw renewed interest in 2020 as an Internet meme. It began trending on Twitter because the film&#x27;s poster, which showed zombies pressed up against door windows, bears a striking resemblance to a photojournalist&#x27;s image of protesters in Ohio at the Statehouse demanding lockdown be lifted. The situation was also described as &quot;reminiscent of some of the scenes towards the end of the movie&quot;. The photojournalist was Joshua A. Bickel, who said that he &quot;thought the windows and door were an interesting compositional element&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; prosthetist Tom Savini said it reminds him of &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; because both use the pressed-up-against-glass horror trope.

The film also has a tribute with a zombie hand sculpture at the Hakone Museum in Japan, where it is a cult hit despite not having a theatrical release in the country until March 2019, 15 years after it was first released.

Films that have been based on or inspired by &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; include &quot;Juan of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Hsien of the Dead&quot;, and &quot;Shed of the Dead&quot;.

==Analysis==
Film scholar Kyle Bishop, Literature scholar and leading zombie film researcher Peter Dendle, and Sci-Fi scholar Gerry Canavan all comment on &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; as part of a large body of zombie narratives produced in the wake of 9/11. Bishop explained that the &quot;renaissance of the subgenre reveals a connection between zombie cinema and post-9/11 cultural consciousness&quot;, because &quot;horror films function as barometers of society&#x27;s anxieties, and zombie movies represent the inescapable realities of unnatural death while presenting a grim view of the modern apocalypse&quot;. He finds that the subgenre of zombie films &quot;can shock and terrify a population that has become numb to other horror subgenres&quot;, with Dendle similarly assessing that &quot;the possibility of wide-scale destruction and devastation which 9/11 brought once again into the communal consciousness found a ready narrative expression in the zombie apocalypses which over thirty years had honed images of desperation subsistence and amoral survivalism to a fine edge&quot;.

Dirk Eitzen also examined the film in depth as an example of how comedy is made in film, particularly how interpretive humour and satire are used. For instance, when Shaun slips and falls in the shop in the opening sequence, per Eitzen&#x27;s explanation, it is funny on several levels. Falling is funny; not noticing the zombie apocalypse is funny; the social satire that contrasts Shaun&#x27;s mindless behaviour with the mindless zombies is funny; and the self-reference to where Shaun had slipped on a curb earlier in the sequence is funny, too. Media scholar Lindsey Decker wrote on how the film created comedy through transnational generic hybridisation, taking cues from American zombie films as well as &quot;British comedic practices from WWII-era Ealing comedies, television two-man comedy teams and the Monty Python sketch troupe&quot;. In this use of British comedy within an American genre, it also serves as commentary on British-American relations in the film industry.

Multiple chapters of the 2016 book &quot;The Laughing Dead: The Horror-Comedy Film from Bride of Frankenstein to Zombieland&quot; are devoted to analysing aspects of &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;. Steven Webley&#x27;s chapter looks at the use of the Uncanny in the film, while Shelley S. Rees&#x27; chapter discusses the film&#x27;s Marxist implications and the transgressive nature of zombies and zombie films in terms of relationships and sexuality. Comparatively, Kathryn A. Cady and Thomas Oates write in their article &#x27;Family Splatters: Rescuing Heteronormativity from the Zombie Apocalypse&#x27; that the film &quot;imagines a single-generation heteronormative family as the outcome of zombie invasion&quot;.

Beyond film studies, a Bayesian mathematical model using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods was performed on examples of epidemic progression by Caitlyn Witkowski and Brian Blais in 2013. As an example of how such modelling could be applied to infectious disease control, Witkowski and Blais took examples of zombie apocalypses in Romero&#x27;s original &quot;Dead&quot; trilogy and &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; to demonstrate disease dynamics.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===
In the UK (all figures in US$), &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; grossed $3.0million at the box office in its opening weekend, being shown in 367 cinemas and starting a run of five consecutive weekends in the UK top 10. In the United States and Canada, it grossed $3.3million in its opening weekend, across 607 theatres, starting a run of three consecutive weekends in the US-Canada Top 10. Including brief re-releases in 2020 and 2022, &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; grossed $13.5million in the United States and Canada, and $25.1million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $38.7million, against a budget of $6million.

===Critical response===

&quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; received critical acclaim. 

Nev Pierce, reviewing the film for the BBC, called it a &quot;side-splitting, head-smashing, gloriously gory horror comedy&quot; that will &quot;amuse casual viewers and delight genre fans&quot;. Peter Bradshaw gave it four stars out of five, saying it &quot;boasts a script crammed with real gags&quot; and is &quot;pacily directed [and] nicely acted&quot;. Wendy Ide for Screen Daily wrote that the film &quot;proves that the move from small to big screen comedy does not always end in artistic failure&quot;, saying that the film stays true to Pegg and Wright&#x27;s style but also makes use of comedy more accessible to the British masses than that of &quot;Spaced&quot;.

Pierce wrote that the choice of weapons was amusing, and he suggested that the film&#x27;s real strength was the characterisation of the unhappy leads. He felt that the climax at the pub was lacking in horror and comedy compared to the rest of the film. Like Pierce, Ide felt that there is &quot;a convincing emotional depth&quot; despite the comedy; she similarly noted that the second half was slower but chalked this up to being darker in tone at the climax. She praised the special effects make-up and prosthetics created by Stuart Conran. Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; enjoyed the record-throwing scene, citing it as an example of where the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t mind putting in extra work for its laughs&quot;, as it comes off funnier with Shaun and Ed debating which records they sacrifice rather than throwing indiscriminately. He found Wright&#x27;s technical skills to be impressive, adding that Wright left the spotlight to the performances rather than the camerawork, but found the finale to be disappointingly played straight.

Both the American critics Roger Ebert and Robert K. Elder said that the film brought something more to the zombie genre. Ebert wrote that he was &quot;by now more or less exhausted by the cinematic possibilities of killing [zombies]&quot;, and so he was glad for what &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; brought to the table outside of this, writing that &quot;instead of focusing on the Undead and trying to get the laughs there, it treats the living characters as sitcom regulars whose conflicts and arguments keep getting interrupted by annoying flesh-eaters&quot;. Elder agreed that by its release the zombie film had &quot;ambled its course&quot;, but thought that &quot;&quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; stands on its own, a romantic comedy crossed with a quarter-life crisis drama–just played against a background horde of brain-hungry, decomposing undead&quot;. B. Alan Orange of MovieWeb wrote that &quot;The British Zombie experience &#x27;is&#x27; different enough to change the outlook of a whole genre&quot;.

Of the cast, Ebert particularly praised Nighy, writing that &quot;there&#x27;s something endearing about his response [&quot;I ran it under a cold tap&quot;] when he is bitten by a zombie&quot;. Elder described Nighy as the film&#x27;s scene stealer.

Peter Travers also gave the film three out of four stars and praised Pegg: &quot;[he] makes you root for Shaun, even when he’s slacking with Ed [...], neglecting Liz and battling with his mum&quot;. Phipps&#x27; take on Shaun was that &quot;Pegg gives his hero a defeated look that slowly melts away as the crisis at last gives him a chance to become a man of action&quot;.

===Accolades===
===Best-of lists and appraisal===
In 2004, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine named &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; the 49th greatest British film of all time. In 2006, it was rated as the third greatest comedy film of all time in the Channel 4 list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films, with only &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian&quot; and &quot;Airplane!&quot; ranked higher. In 2007, &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; named it the ninth-greatest zombie film ever made. In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; named it one of the 25 best horror films, calling the film &quot;spooky, silly and smart-smart-smart&quot; and complimenting its director: &quot;Wright, who&#x27;d be a director to watch in any genre, plays world-class games with the camera and the viewer&#x27;s expectations of what&#x27;s supposed to happen in a scare film&quot;. Bloody Disgusting ranked the film second in their list of the &#x27;Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade&#x27;, with the article saying &quot;&quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; isn&#x27;t just the best horror-comedy of the decade – it&#x27;s quite possibly the best horror-comedy ever made&quot;. In December 2009, &quot;Now&quot; deemed &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; the best film of the decade. In March 2011, the film was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their second favourite film of all time. Frank Darabont&#x27;s &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; came in first place. In 2008, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine named it as one of the Top 500 films, for which a new release poster was made for the film, and in 2016 &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it 6th on their list of the 100 best British films, with their entry stating, &quot;it&#x27;s a masterpiece, right up there with &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; as one of the finest horror/comedies ever made&quot;.

George A. Romero first saw the film after Wright called to ask him what he thought of it; he watched it in a Florida cinema by himself and called them to give his approval. He was so impressed with Pegg and Wright&#x27;s work that he asked them to make cameos in his 2005 film &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;; both Pegg and Wright insisted on being zombies rather than the slightly more noticeable roles that were initially offered. Pegg and Frost also reprised their roles (in animation) as Shaun and Ed in the &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; Halloween special &quot;Night of the Living Pharmacists&quot; in October 2014. Quentin Tarantino described the film as one of his top twenty favourite films made since 1992, and horror novelist Stephen King described it as &quot;a &#x27;10&#x27; on the fun meter and destined to be a cult classic&quot;. The film has garnered a cult following, generally among &quot;millennial comedy and horror lovers alike&quot;.

<doc id="598398" wikidata="Q912120" url="?curid=598398" title="Brian Duffy (astronaut)">
<text>Brian Duffy (born June 20, 1953, Boston, Massachusetts) is a retired U.S. Air Force colonel and a former NASA astronaut. He flew aboard four Space Shuttle missions.

==Education==

Duffy graduated from Rockland High School, Rockland, Massachusetts in 1971. In 1975 he received a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from the United States Air Force Academy and completed Undergraduate Pilot Training as part of Class 76-10 at Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi, in August 1976. In 1981 he received a Master of Science degree in systems management from the University of Southern California.

==Military career==
After graduating from the USAF Academy in 1975, Duffy was selected to fly the F-15 and was stationed at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, until 1979, when he transferred to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, Japan. He flew F-15s there until 1982 when he was selected to attend the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base in California and then became the Director of F-15 Flight Test at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.

Duffy logged over 5,000 hours of flight time in more than 25 different aircraft.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in June 1985, Duffy became an astronaut in July 1986. He participated in the development and testing of displays, flight crew procedures, and computer software to be used on Shuttle flights. He served as spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control during numerous Space Shuttle missions. He also served as Assistant Director (Technical) and as Deputy Director (Acting) of the Johnson Space Center. In this role he assisted the Center Director in the direction and management of JSC&#x27;s resources, functions, programs, and projects assigned to the center. A veteran of four space flights, he has logged a total of 40 days, 17 hours, 34 minutes and 59 seconds in space.

===Space flight experience===
Duffy was the pilot on STS-45 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (March 24 to April 2, 1992), the first of the ATLAS series of missions to address the atmosphere and its interaction with the Sun.

He also was the pilot on STS-57 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (June 21 to July 1, 1993). Mission highlights included retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier with the Shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm, a spacewalk by two crew members, and an assortment of experiments in the first flight of the Spacehab middeck augmentation module.

Duffy next commanded a six-man crew on STS-72 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (January 11–20, 1996). During the 9-day flight, the crew retrieved the Space Flyer Unit (launched from Japan 10-months earlier), deployed and retrieved the OAST-Flyer, and conducted two spacewalks to demonstrate and evaluate techniques to be used in the assembly of the International Space Station.

Duffy commanded a crew of seven on STS-92 &quot;Discovery&quot; (October 11–24, 2000). During the 13-day flight, the seven member crew attached the Z1 Truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to the International Space Station using &quot;Discovery&quot;″s robotic arm and performed four spacewalks to configure these elements. This expansion of the ISS opened the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first resident crew.

==Post-retirement business career==
Duffy retired from the Air Force and NASA in 2001. He was Vice President of Mission Operations and Support Services for the Lockheed Martin Corporation from 2004 to 2008. He is currently Vice President and JSC Program Manager for Exploration Systems at Orbital ATK, which was acquired by and renamed Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems in 2018.

==Personal life==
Brian Duffy is married to the former Janet M. Helms of West Lafayette, Indiana, and they have two children.

<doc id="598399" wikidata="Q3477321" url="?curid=598399" title="Parliamentary private secretary">
<text>A parliamentary private secretary (PPS) is a member of Parliament (MP) in the United Kingdom who acts as an unpaid assistant to a government minister or a shadow minister. They are selected from backbench MPs as the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the minister in the House of Commons.

PPSs are junior to parliamentary under-secretaries of state, a ministerial post salaried by one or more departments.

== Duties and powers of a PPS ==
Although not paid other than their salary as an MP, PPSs help the government track backbench opinion in Parliament. They are subject to some restrictions, as outlined in the Ministerial Code of the British government, but are not members of the Government.

A PPS can sit on select committees but must avoid &quot;associating themselves with recommendations critical of, or embarrassing to the Government&quot;, and must not make statements or ask questions on matters affecting the minister&#x27;s department. In particular, the PPS in the Department for Communities and Local Government may not participate in planning decisions or in the consideration of planning cases.

PPSs are not members of the government, and all efforts are made to avoid these positions being referred to as such. They are instead considered more simply as normal Members. However, their close confidence with ministers does impose obligations on every PPS. The guidelines surrounding the divulging of classified information by ministers to PPSs are rigid.

Ministers choose their own PPSs, but they are expected to consult the Chief Whip and must seek the written approval for each candidate from the prime minister.

Although not on the government payroll, PPSs are expected to act as part of the payroll vote, voting in line with the government on every division.

When on official Departmental business, a PPS receives travel and subsistence allowance paid out of government funds, as with formal members of the government. This makes the PPS the only type of unpaid advisor who receives reimbursement in the course of duty.

Overseas travel for PPSs must be approved by the Prime Minister and is granted only in exceptional cases.

== The role in the career of MPs ==
The role of PPS is seen as a starting point for many MPs who aspire to become ministers themselves. According to Philip W. Buck, a professor of political science at Stanford University:

After the leaking of party details in emails associated with Desmond Swayne, PPS to David Cameron, a writer of the Thirsk and Malton Labour Party Constituency Blog commented:

== Current Parliamentary Private Secretaries ==
The following is a list of Parliamentary Private Secretaries in the UK, since the swearing in of the Starmer ministry on 5 July 2024. The Leader of the Opposition usually has at least one Parliamentary Private Secretary as well.

== Johnson ministry (2022) ==
The following is a list of Parliamentary Private Secretaries under the Second Johnson ministry as of April 2022.

== Johnson ministry (2021) ==
==Notable Parliamentary Private Secretaries to the Prime Minister==

While giving the holder a close-up view of the workings of government at the highest levels, relatively few Parliamentary Private Secretaries to the Prime Minister seem to have gone on to serve at the highest level of government themselves, although Sir Alec Douglas-Home served as Prime Minister in 1963–4, while Anthony Barber was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1970 to 1974, Robert Carr, Home Secretary, 1972–4, and Christopher Soames, Peter Shore, and Gavin Williamson, the future Secretary of State for Education, all went on to be senior Cabinet ministers.

<text>Bonnie Jeanne Dunbar (born March 3, 1949) is an American engineer and retired NASA astronaut. She flew on five Space Shuttle missions between 1985 and 1998, including two dockings with the &quot;Mir&quot; space station. 

A graduate of the University of Washington, where she earned a Master of Science degree in ceramics engineering, Dunbar became a senior research engineer in Rockwell International&#x27;s Space Division, where she designed the equipment and manufacturing processes used to fabricate the ceramic tiles used in the Space Shuttle thermal protection system. In 1978, she joined NASA as a flight controller / payload officer, and was a guidance and navigation controller for Skylab during its de-orbiting and re-entry in July 1979. She was selected as one of the nineteen astronaut candidates in NASA Astronaut Group 9 in 1980. She flew in space five times, on the STS-61-A, STS-32, STS-50, STS-71 and STS-89, and trained in Russia as a cosmonaut.

Dunbar left NASA to become the president and chief executive officer of the Museum of Flight in Seattle, where she was involved in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education for high school students. From 2013 to 2015, she led the University of Houston&#x27;s STEM Center and was a faculty member in the Cullen College of Engineering. She became the John and Bea Slattery professor of aerospace engineering at Texas A&amp;M University in 2016, and was the Director of the Institute for Engineering Education and Innovation (IEEI) there from 2016 to 2020.

== Early life and education ==
Bonnie Jeanne Dunbar was born in Sunnyside, Washington, on March 3, 1949, the oldest of four children of Robert and Ethel Dunbar. She has two younger brothers and a sister. Her father was a United States Marine Corps veteran who returned from World War II and purchased of land in Outlook, Washington, through a lottery for veterans in 1948. She grew up on the farm, could drive a tractor when she was about nine years old, and she helped her father repair tractors. The Future Farmers of America did not accept girls so when she was nine her father started a 4-H club so she could show cattle, which she did until she was eighteen, although she was the only girl. In October 1957, Dunbar and her parents gazed at the night sky, looking for Sputnik, the first artificial satellite. She became fascinated with space, reading science fiction novels by H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, and following the real-life exploits of the Mercury Seven. In 1962, the family went to the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair, which showcased an imaginary ride into space, a science pavilion and the Space Needle.

Dunbar attended Outlook Elementary, a small rural school that went to the eighth grade. When she told the principal that she had an ambition to one day build spacecraft, he recommended that she learn algebra. She attended Sunnyside High School, where she took physics and chemistry and math algebra, trigonometry, analysis and precalculus classes. She was a member of the math club, debate club, speech club, and Latin club. She played sports and was a cheerleader for three years. Her high school career guidance counselor advised her that since she grew up on a farm, she should marry a farmer and have children. Dunbar ignored her and turned to her physics teacher for career advice instead. She scored high marks in spatial ability and English on her SATs. Boys with similar scores in spatial ability were steered towards science and engineering, but these were not considered options for girls.

After Dunbar graduated from high school in 1967, she wanted to attend California Institute of Technology or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, because that was where many astronauts had gone, but the former did not yet accept women as students, and the latter was unaffordable. She was accepted by the University of Washington, which also offered her financial assistance under the National Defense Student Loan program. She became the first member of her family to attend college. Neither Dunbar nor her parents were aware that she had to select a college within the university and could not take classes on anything that interested her. She was interested in the Romantic poets like Lord Byron, Percy Shelley and John Keats, but she still wanted to build spacecraft, so her physics teacher advised her to study engineering.

As a student at the University of Washington, Dunbar took heavy course loads, but also served on the Engineering Student Council and played on its baseball team. As a freshman, she aspired to join the university&#x27;s Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) unit, but it did not accept women then. Instead, she became a volunteer for Angel Flight, a coeducational military support-oriented organization. She worked as a waitress at the Greek Pastry Shop on The Ave and in movie theaters in the University District. She joined the Kappa Delta sorority&#x27;s Sigma Iota chapter as a sophomore. James I. Mueller, the dean of the ceramics engineering department, heard that she was interested in space, and he had a grant from NASA to develop the ceramic tiles used by the Space Shuttle thermal protection system. He persuaded her to change her major from aeronautical engineering to ceramic engineering, and during the summer break she became part of his team conducting X-ray diffraction studies of some of the different forms of silica fibers that were being considered for use in the tiles. She graduated with her Bachelor of Science degree in ceramic engineering. in 1971. She did some graduate work at the University of Illinois.

Engineering jobs were hard to find in 1971, so Dunbar accepted a position as an office manager at a Seattle linen-supply company. Two months later, she secured a position in the computer services division at Boeing through her experience in writing programs in Fortran IV. Boeing trained her in COBOL, and she went to work at the Boeing Renton Factory. After a year and a half, she got a call from Mueller, who informed her that he had secured a grant from NASA, and asked if she would be interested in graduate school. The grant was for investigating the use of beta-alumina solid electrolyte in batteries, and Dunbar researched the kinetics of ionic diffusion in sodium beta-alumina, with Suren Sarian as her advisor. She received her Master of Science degree in ceramics engineering from the University of Washington in 1975.

In 1975, Dunbar was invited to participate in research at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in Oxfordshire, as a visiting scientist. She researched the wetting behavior of liquids on solid substrates. Before she left for England, she had already accepted a position in Downey, California, as a senior research engineer with Rockwell International&#x27;s Space Division starting in October 1976. Her responsibilities involved developing the equipment and processes required to fabricate the Space Shuttle thermal protection system tiles that she had worked on as an undergraduate. She served as a Rockwell&#x27;s representative on Kraft Ehricke&#x27;s evaluation committee on prospective space industrialization concepts, and she was Rockwell’s Engineer of the Year in 1978 for her work on the thermal protection system.

== NASA career ==
=== Flight controller / payload officer ===
NASA issued a call for applications for pilot and mission specialist candidates on July 8, 1976. For the first time, women were encouraged to apply. Dunbar was one of 8,079 applicants. She was selected as one of 200 finalists, and was asked to report to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas, for a week of interviews and evaluations, commencing on October 17, 1977. She was not selected; instead of a call from George Abbey, the Director of Flight Operations, she received one from Carolyn Huntoon. However, Abbey offered her another job at JSC. Joe Cuzzupoli, the vice president at Rockwell, advised her to accept; her promotion prospects at Rockwell were uncertain, since she was the youngest member of her group, and if NASA did not work out she was always welcome to return to Rockwell. In July 1978, Dunbar joined NASA as a flight controller / payload officer. She was a guidance and navigation controller for Skylab and monitored its de-orbiting and re-entry in July 1979. Afterward, she returned to her payload operator role, preparing for the upcoming STS-1 Space Shuttle mission.

Dunbar noted that all the women accepted in NASA Astronaut Group 8 in 1978 had M.D. or Ph.D. degrees or had nearly completed one. She therefore embarked on earning a Ph.D. in mechanical/biomedical engineering at the University of Houston. She took classes for two years. Her research project involved testing rats with hind leg suspension as a means of simulating the effects of a microgravity environment. The rats were kept at the Life Sciences Laboratory (Building 37) at JSC. She would dissect their femurs to study the bone, and measure their strength in the Instron machines in the Structures and Mechanics Laboratory (Building 13). Her thesis on the &quot;Effects of antiorthostatic kinesia on Sprague Dawley rat femur fracture toughness and concomitant alterations in metabolic activity&quot; was accepted and she was awarded her doctorate in 1983.

=== Astronaut ===

On August 1, 1979, NASA announced another round of selections for astronaut candidates. There were 3,122 applicants. Once again Dunbar was a finalist, and she was asked to report for interviews and examinations on March 24, 1980. This time she got a call from Abbey asking if she would like to move her office down the hall (where the astronauts were). Her selection as one of the 19 astronaut candidates in NASA Astronaut Group 9 was announced on May 29, 1980. She was one of six civilians selected in the group, three of whom were JSC employees.

After completing a year of astronaut candidate training, Dunbar officially became a fully-fledged NASA astronaut on August 21, 1981. Her technical assignments included assisting with the testing of the Space Shuttle onboard software at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL). She was a member of the Flight Crew Equipment Control Board, and as such was involved in the remote manipulator system (RMS) development. She later became the chief of the Mission Development Branch, and was the Astronaut Office interface for &quot;secondary&quot; payloads, and the lead for the Science Support Group. She was a member of the support crews for the STS-2 and STS-9 missions, and worked with Walter Cronkite on the CBS television coverage of the STS-2 mission.

====STS-61-A====

On February 14, 1984, NASA announced that Dunbar had been selected as a member of the crew for the upcoming Spacelab D-1 mission. The Federal Republic of Germany paid $65 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for the mission to be dedicated to German science experiments. The other NASA mission specialist assigned to the flight, Guy Bluford, was not yet available, so the payload coordinator, William B. Lenoir sent Dunbar to Germany to coordinate the arrangements for the mission. She lived there for seven months. Although the mission was conducted in English through the German Aerospace Center (DFVLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Dunbar was given instruction in the German language.
The Germans were concerned by the assignment of a woman to the mission. Some of the experiments involved drawing blood, and the possibility of female blood had not been considered, and some of the experiments like the vestibular system sled did not fit her. There were rumors that NASA had deliberately assigned her to the mission as an insult to the Germans. Dunbar reported this to George Abbey, who drafted a memo to the DFVLR stating that all equipment for the mission had to accommodate a range of sizes.

STS-61-A lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in the on October 30, 1985. With eight crew members, this mission was the largest to fly in space, and it was the only mission that launched with eight crew members. For the first time, payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. The crew of five astronauts and three payload specialists worked in two twelve-hours shifts, red and blue; Dunbar was in charge of the blue shift and Bluford of the red shift. Some 75 scientific experiments were carried out, ranging from physiology and biology to materials science and navigation. Although she performed various experiments, Dunbar was primarily responsible for the operation of the Spacelab and its subsystems.

&quot;Challenger&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California on November 6, after 7 days, 44 minutes and 51 seconds, during which it had traveled 2.5 million miles and orbited the Earth 111 times.

===STS-32===
Flight assignments were canceled in the wake of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in January 1986, but Dunbar became the chairman of NASA&#x27;s Microgravity Materials Science Assessment Task Force, which examined proposals for materials science experiments with Spacelab and the proposed Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;. She also became a member of the Astronaut Science Support Group, that collaborated with engineers on the design of experiments and experimental apparatus.
On June 29, 1989, NASA announced Dunbar&#x27;s assignment to her second space flight, the STS-32 mission, also known as Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) retrieval mission.

One of the largest payloads ever deployed by the Space Shuttle, the LDEF was a satellite containing 57 experiments to study the effects of long-term exposure to the Low Earth Orbit space environment. It had been launched by the STS-41-C mission on April 7, 1984, and by January 1990 its orbit had decayed to about and it was only a month or so away from re-entering the atmosphere and burning up.

The STS-32 mission lifted off from the KSC in the on January 9, 1990. The crew deployed the Syncom IV-F5 satellite, and Dunbar operated the RMS to retrieve the LDEF. The crew operated a variety of experiments, but Dunbar was the principal investigator of the Microgravity Disturbance Experiment using the Fluids Experiment Apparatus. Other experiments investigated protein crystal growth, echocardiography, latitude/longitude locating, mesoscale convective system lightning and circadian rhythms. The crew themselves were test subjects for investigations of the benefits of in-flight aerobic exercise and human adaptation to extended duration missions. Activities were filmed using an IMAX camera.

&quot;Columbia&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base after a mission lasting 10 days, 21 hours, 1 minute and 38 seconds, during which it had traveled in 173 orbits of the Earth.
===STS-50===
Planned Spacelab missions for the early 1990s included another mission for Germany (D-2) and one for Japan (J), while NASA focused on two Spacelab life sciences (SLS) missions, SLS-1 and SLS-2. It was realized that leaving materials science to the Europeans and Japanese meant that NASA had no research facilities in development of the kind that were envisaged for the Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;. To address this, Dunbar was appointed the head of the Microgravity Materials Research Task Group. Dunbar was designated the payload commander for STS-50, the United States Microgravity Lab-1 (USML-1) mission, which was dedicated to microgravity and materials science experiments. As payload commander, she organized the crew schedule and training activities for the mission. 

The STS-50 mission lifted off from KSC in &quot;Columbia&quot; on June 25, 1992. Over thirty experiments sponsored by more than researchers were housed in the Spacelab. Over the next thirteen days, the payload crew of four performed a series of experiments related to human physiology and the growth of various crystals in microgravity. A microscope was carried on board so images could be taken of crystals as they were growing. 

&quot;Columbia&quot; landed back at the KSC on July 9, after 13 days, 19 hours, 30 minutes and 4 seconds, having traveled and made 221 orbits of the Earth.

===STS-71===
In 1993, Dunbar became the Deputy Associate Administrator in the Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. In this role she was involved in key decisions regarding the redesign of the &quot;Freedom&quot; space station, such as the decision to use air at , which was necessary for experiments with plants.

Dunbar returned to the Astronaut Office in Houston in December 1993. She was approached by David Leestma, a fellow member of the 1980 group of astronauts who was now the Director of Flight Crew Operations, who informed her that he needed someone to go to Russia as a backup for Norman Thagard, who had been designated to become the first US astronaut to fly in space on the Russian &quot;Mir&quot; space station. Finding a volunteer for a grueling year-long training program without any assurance of a flight at the end of it had been difficult. No American astronaut had served as a backup since the early days of the Space Shuttle program, and none had flown or even trained for a long-duration mission since Skylab, almost twenty years before.

Dunbar protested that while she had begun learning Russian, her knowledge of the language was far short of the fluency that would be required. After meetings with Carolyn Huntoon and George Abbey, who figured that since she had learned some German for the D-1 mission, she should be able to pick up Russian. Dunbar reluctantly agreed. On February 4, 1994, NASA announced that Thagard and Dunbar had been selected for the prime an backup crews for a three-month flight on &quot;Mir&quot; in 1995.

In February 1994, Dunbar traveled to Star City, Russia, where she spent thirteen months in training to be a back-up &quot;Mir&quot; crew member. She found Russian attitudes towards women disconcerting and dismissive, but made friends with Russian women who worked there as engineers and mathematicians and were eager to see her succeed. This included survival training for the contingency of a landing in the Arctic region of northern Russia, which Dunbar enjoyed, as it reminded her of home. As it happened all seven Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; astronauts ultimately returned to Earth on Space Shuttle missions, but an emergency evacuation in a &quot;Soyuz&quot; spacecraft was always a possibility. In March 1995, the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center certified her as qualified for long-duration &quot;Mir&quot; flights. To obtain this credential she took a series of final oral examinations for each system, in which members of the training department fired questions at her in Russian.
Although Dunbar did not fly a long-duration mission on &quot;Mir&quot; due to delays in negotiations, the training was not wasted, for she visited on the STS-71 mission. Dunbar was mission specialist 3 on this flight, assisting Ellen S. Baker, the payload commander. The mission lifted off from KSC in the on June 27, 1995. On this mission, the Space Shuttle mission docked with &quot;Mir&quot; for the first time, and there was an exchange of crews. A Spacelab module was also carried so the crew could perform medical evaluations of the &quot;Mir&quot; crew. These evaluations were designed to ascertain and measure the effect of prolonged weightlessness on the bones, muscles, and the cardiovascular, immune system, and cardiopulmonary systems.

The STS-71 mission lasted 9 days, 19 hours, 23 minutes and 8 seconds. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at KSC on July 7, having traveled and orbited the Earth 153 times.

===STS-89===
In January 1998, Dunbar returned to &quot;Mir&quot; on the STS-89 mission in the . Launched from KSC on January 22, 1998, this was the eighth mission in which the Space Shuttle docked with the &quot;Mir&quot; space station. The Space Shuttle crew transferred more than of scientific and logistical equipment, and supplies of food and water from the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; to &quot;Mir&quot;. For the fifth and final time, an astronaut, in this case Andy Thomas, was delivered to &quot;Mir&quot; and one was returned, in this case David Wolf. As the payload commander, Dunbar was responsible for the twenty-three scientific and technological experiments. &quot;Endeavour&quot; touched down at KSC after 8 days, 19 hours and 47 seconds during which &quot;Endeavour&quot; had traveled in 138 orbits of the Earth.

Between October 1995 and November 1996, Dunbar worked in the Mission Operations Directorate at JSC as the assistant director for ISS readiness and Russian-American cooperation. In this role she chaired International Space Station (ISS) training readiness reviews, and facilitated Russian-American operational and training activities.
Dunbar retired from NASA on September 30, 2005. On her five space flights, she had logged over 1,208 hours (more than 50 days) in space. As a private pilot, she has flown more than 200 hours in single-engine aircraft. She also logged over 700 hours flying time in NASA T-38 Talon jets as a back-seater, and 100 hours as a Cessna Citation jet co-pilot.

== Post-NASA career ==

Dunbar left NASA to become the president and chief executive officer of the Museum of Flight in Seattle. She founded the Washington Aerospace Scholars program, an online distance learning course for high school juniors run in partnership with NASA and Washington state. She expanded participation in the museum&#x27;s Aviation Learning Center, Aerospace Camp Experience and Challenger Learning Center. The museum&#x27;s K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs were expanded to reach nearly 140,000 students per year. The museum&#x27;s collections and exhibition spaces were expanded and she oversaw the construction of the T. Evans Wyckoff Memorial Bridge. The museum became a Smithsonian affiliate and was re-accredited with the American Association of Museums. She handed over day-to-day management of the museum in April 2010, and officially left the museum on July 1, 2010. She attempted to acquire a Space Shuttle for the museum. In this she was unsuccessful, but the museum did manage to acquire NASA&#x27;s Full-Fuselage Shuttle Trainer for its Space Gallery.

From 2013 to 2015, Dunbar led the University of Houston&#x27;s STEM Center and was a faculty member in the Cullen College of Engineering.

<text>Potchefstroom ( ; ), colloquially known as Potch, is an academic city in the North West Province of South Africa. It hosts the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University. Potchefstroom is on the Mooirivier (Afrikaans for &quot;pretty river&quot;), roughly west-southwest of Johannesburg and east-northeast of Klerksdorp.

==Etymology==
Several theories exist about the origin of the city&#x27;s name. According to one theory, it originates from &quot;Potgieter&quot; + &quot;Chef&quot; + &quot;stroom&quot; (referring to Voortrekker leader and town founder Andries Potgieter; &quot;chef&quot; indicates the leader of the Voortrekkers, and &quot;stroom&quot; refers to the Mooi River).

Geoffrey Jenkins writes, &quot;Others however, attribute the name as having come from the word &#x27;Potscherf&#x27;, meaning a shard of a broken pot, due to the cracks that appear in the soil of the Mooi River Valley during drought resembling a broken pot&quot;. M. L. Fick suggests that Potchefstroom developed from the abbreviation of &quot;Potgieterstroom&quot; to &quot;Potgerstroom&quot;, which became &quot;Potchefstroom&quot;. However, this does not account for the appearance of &quot;Potjestroom&quot; on many documents and photographs.

The African National Congress decided to change the name of the municipality and some street names in 2006, favouring &quot;Tlokwe&quot; as the new name. In 2007, its name was changed from Potchefstroom Municipality to Tlokwe Municipality. However, the city continued to use the name Potchefstroom. The Tlokwe Municipality merged with the Ventersdorp Municipality in 2016, forming the larger JB Marks Local Municipality.

==History==
Potchefstroom, founded in 1838 by the Voortrekkers, is the second-oldest European settlement in the Transvaal. The oldest European settlement is Klerksdorp, about west. Some historians challenge this, because the first settlement was in the &quot;upper regions of the Schoon Spruit&quot; (believed to have been between Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom). However, Potchefstroom was the first to develop into a town.

Until 1840, the towns of Potchefstroom and Winburg and their surrounding territories were a Boer Republic known as the Republic of Winburg-Potchefstroom. Voortrekker leader Andries Hendrik Potgieter was elected as chief commandant. In October 1840, after a meeting between Potgieter, Andries Pretorius and G. R. van Rooyen, it was decided that Potchefstroom would unite with &quot;Pieter Mouriets Burg&quot; (Pietermaritzburg).

On 16–17 January 1852, the Sand River Convention was signed between Andries Pretorius (representing the Boers) and Major W. S. Hogge and C. M. Owen (representing Britain). According to the convention, the British government would allow the immigrant farmers north of the Vaal River to govern themselves with no interference from either side. This signalled the establishment of the South African Republic. In Article 17 of the Constitution of the South African Republic dated 18 February 1858 (which was accepted in Rustenburg), it was stated that &quot;Potchefstroom, located on the Mooi River, would be the capital of the Republic and that Pretoria would be the seat of government&quot;. In May 1860, Potchefstroom became the &quot;chief city&quot; of the republic and the capital moved to Pretoria.

On 16 December 1880, the First Boer War began when the Boers laid siege to the old fort, then occupied by British forces. The siege ended amicably on 23 March 1881. During the Second Boer War, the British established a concentration camp in Potchefstroom for Afrikaner civilians, primarily women and children, who were captured in the Boer republics by British forces as part of a scorched earth campaign.

At the opening of the city hall in 1909, colonial secretary Jan Smuts was asked about the possibility of Potchefstroom becoming capital of the Union. He replied that the city stood no chance, but should aim to be South Africa&#x27;s largest educational centre.
This has led to Potchefstroom&#x27;s being the &quot;city of expertise&quot;, with numerous tertiary educational institutions. It has hosted the annual late-September Aardklop Arts Festival, a predominantly-Afrikaans arts festival, since 1997.

==Population==
The Potchefstroom Municipality, which encompasses several neighbouring settlements, had a population of 128,357 in the 2007 community survey. Of these, 69.6 percent were White, 27.0 percent were Black, three percent were Coloureds and 0.4 percent were Asian. However, the city itself and surrounding suburbs have a population of 43,448, of which 69.9 percent are White, 25.4 percent are Black, 2.8 percent were Coloured and 1.3 percent were Asian.

Ken McArthur of Potchefstroom won a gold medal at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics in the marathon. McArthur was known in his home village of North Antrim for his training routine, which consisted of racing a narrow-gauge train.

==Education==
Potchefstroom is home to five tertiary institutions, 30 other schools and a number of research bureaus and training centres, including:
*The North-West University, a merged tertiary institution which was created on 1 January 2004, with campuses in Potchefstroom, Mafikeng and Vanderbijlpark. The Potchefstroom Campus (formerly the Potchefstroomse Universiteit vir Christelike Hoër Onderwys, founded in 1869) is the largest, and the university&#x27;s head office is located there. The North-West University became one of South Africa&#x27;s larger universities after the merger, with about 32,000 full-time and distance-education students.
*The Potchefstroom College of Education (originally the Normal College), which was founded in 1919. The college was originally housed in galvanised-iron buildings on the same premises as the Potchefstroom High School for Boys, and moved to its present location in 1923. The College of Education was incorporated by the university on 1 January 2001.
*The Technical College Potchefstroom, founded in 1939 when the Union Education Department began &quot;continuation classes&quot;.
*The Agricultural Centre, previously known as the Experimental Farm (1902) and Agricultural College (1939), is the largest agricultural facility in one location in southern Africa. The centre houses the headquarters of the Highveld Region of the Department of Agriculture, the Grain Crops Institute, and the Agricultural College. The Potchefstroom Koekoek chicken was developed there.
*Potchefstroom Akademie, founded in 1981 by Tina Schöltz, offers tertiary education in somatology, health and skincare therapy, holistic health therapies and interior design and decorating.
*Potchefstroom High School for Girls: Originally known as the Central School, it was established in 1874. Girls High was founded in 1905, when the Central School was divided into separate high schools for boys and girls.
*Potchefstroom High School for Boys, established in 1874, has been at its current site since 1905.
*HTS Potchefstroom, founded in January 1903
*Potchefstroom Central Primary School, the city&#x27;s only English-speaking primary school
*Hoër Volkskool Potchefstroom, founded in 1927
*Laerskool President Pretorius, founded in 1897
*Potchefstroom Gimnasium, founded in 1907
Public primary and high schools in Potchefstroom&#x27;s townships include Boitirelo Primary School, Lesego Primary School, Boitshoko High School, Tlokwe High School and Hoerskool Ferdinand Postma

==Sports facilities==
Potchefstroom, known as the North West Province&#x27;s &quot;Home of Sport&quot;, is the provincial headquarters of 17 major sports. The city council emphasises the establishment, maintenance and upgrading of its sports facilities, particularly to meet the sporting and recreational needs of its youth. The Mooi River and other trails add colour and variety to facilities available to residents and tourists.

Potchefstroom has hosted two World Cup-winning teams (in cricket and football), and is a home away from home for international athletes and teams. At altitude, it provides a good balance between altitude and quality training. The city has no large factories, and good air quality. Athletes and professional teams train at the North-West University&#x27;s High Performance Institute of Sport.

Cricket is popular, with Senwes Park the home ground of the North-West Dragons. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Potchefstroom hosted matches between Australia and the Netherlands, Australia and Namibia, and South Africa and Kenya. Potchefstroom co-hosted the 2009 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The South Africa national cricket team has regularly chosen Potchefstroom for off-season training and has hosted the Australian team&#x27;s off-season cricket camps. During the 2003 Cricket World Cup, Australia&#x27;s cricket team chose Potchefstroom as their home base and won the tournament.

Rugby is arguably Potchefstroom&#x27;s most popular sport. Olën Park, the main rugby stadium, is primarily used for rugby union matches by the Leopards in the Vodacom Cup and the first division of the Currie Cup. The stadium is also used for football matches, and has hosted the South Africa under-23 team. Jomo Cosmos also uses the stadium for some matches. Profert Olën Park was named after Carl Ludwig Theodor Olën, president of the Western Transvaal Rugby Union between 1922 and 1934. Profert, a local fertiliser company, maintains the playing field.

The Absa Puk Oval is on the North-West University campus. The university sport grounds is known as the Fanie du Toit Sports Complex. The main rugby field has hosted several Leopards games and the Potchefstroom Campus&#x27; Varsity Cup matches.

PUC McArthur Stadium, the athletics stadium, was renovated for the fourth time in 2014. Built in 1892, it was named in honour of 1912 Olympic marathon gold medalist Ken McArthur. Noted local athletes include Godfrey Khotso Mokoena, the silver medalist in the long jump at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games, Hezekiél Sepeng, Jorrie Muller, Justine Robbeson and Ryan Diedericks.

The visit of the Spain national football team during the 2010 FIFA World Cup brought a new level of sport to Potchefstroom and the NWU. Spain, who won their inaugural FIFA World Cup title, chose Potchefstroom as their base camp. A new sports complex was built at the North-West University for the team.

==Politics==

Mayor Maphetle Maphetle of the African National Congress was dismissed in late 2012 after a motion of no confidence passed, and Annette Combrink of the opposition Democratic Alliance was elected mayor. Three months later a motion of no confidence removed Combrink, and Maphetle was reinstated. Since then, municipal-council and mayoral elections have been keenly contested.

<text>Samuel Thornton Durrance (September 17, 1943 – May 5, 2023) was an American scientist who flew aboard two NASA Space Shuttle missions as a payload specialist.

==Background==
Durrance was born September 17, 1943, in Tallahassee, Florida, but grew up in Tampa, Florida. He attended Wilson Junior High and graduated from Plant High School in 1961, lettering in American football for three years and playing both defense and offense. He received a Bachelor of Science degree and a Master of Science degree in physics (with honors), at California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA), 1972 and 1974, respectively, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in astro-geophysics at the University of Colorado at Boulder, 1980. In 2000, he was awarded a Honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Colorado at Boulder along with eight other astronaut alums.

Durrance was a principal research scientist in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. He was a co-investigator for the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, one of the instruments of the Astro Observatory.

Beginning in 2001, he was the executive director of the Florida Space Research Institute which was located at the NASA Kennedy Space Center.

Durrance resided in Melbourne, Florida, and was a professor of physics and space sciences at Florida Institute of Technology.

Durrance was a member of the American Astronomical Society, American Geophysical Union, International Astronomical Union, Association of Space Explorers, Planetary Society, and Phi Kappa Phi.

==Academic career==

Durrance had been involved in the flight hardware development, optical and mechanical design, construction, and integration of the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope and the Astro Observatory, and had conducted research and directed graduate students at the Johns Hopkins University He had designed and built spectrometers, detectors, and imaging systems, and made numerous spacecraft and ground-based astronomical observations. He conceived and directed a program at Johns Hopkins University to develop adaptive-optics instrumentation for ground-based astronomy. He led the team that designed and constructed the Adaptive Optics Coronagraph, which led to the discovery of the first cool brown dwarf orbiting a nearby star. He was also a co-discoverer of changes in the planet-forming disk surrounding the star beta Pictoris.

In March 1986, Durrance&#x27;s first mission was for STS-61-E. It was canceled after the Challenger disaster. Durrance logged over 615 hours in space as a payload specialist and member of the crew of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; for the STS-35/Astro-1 and Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; for the STS-67/Astro-2 missions.

==Later assignment (2006)==

Durrance was employed by the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne, Florida, serving as a professor in the Department of Aerospace, Physics and Space Sciences.

==Illness and death==
Durrance was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2021. He died at a hospice facility in Viera, Florida, on May 5, 2023, of complications from a fall, after battling dementia and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was 79.

<text>Mission Hill is an American adult animated sitcom created by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein for The WB. It originally aired for five episodes from September 21, 1999, to July 16, 2000; unaired episodes were burnt off on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim from May 26 to August 11, 2002. The series follows Andy French, a retail worker who lives with roommates Jim and Posey as well as their dog, Stogie. Andy&#x27;s lifestyle is taken for a turn when his younger brother Kevin moves in with him.

While initially garnering poor ratings, it has since gained a cult following, and is also popular outside of North America, receiving broadcasts in Australia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Spain and New Zealand. Stylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, neon color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional &quot;cartoonish&quot; drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot suffered). The style was made to be reminiscent of 1930s rubber hose cartoons such as Fleischer Studios, Walt Disney, Warner Bros., and MGM, as well as mid-century modern cartoons with the likes of Hanna-Barbera, UPA, Jay Ward, and &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;. The designs were done by Lauren MacMullan, who cites the comic series &quot;Eightball&quot; as her source of inspiration for her overall design.

==History==
&quot;Mission Hill&quot; was conceived in 1997 by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former executive producers/showrunners of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, with the original artistic designer being Lauren MacMullan. Oakley has mentioned that one of the main inspirations for &quot;Mission Hill&quot; was the 1997 MTV series &quot;Austin Stories&quot;, which followed a group of 20-somethings in Austin, Texas. After failed pitches to Fox and NBC, the rights to &quot;Mission Hill&quot; were purchased by Castle Rock Entertainment and The WB in the fall of 1997, following a successful pitch to Garth Ancier, the then-head of programming at the WB. At the pitch, network executives from the WB were presented with three designs for Andy, Jim, Kevin and Posey. One depicted them in a drastically different, more cartoonish art style; the other two drew closer resemblance to the final designs, but one featured slightly more realistic designs for Andy and Kevin, with another featuring less realistic designs for Jim and Posey. When one of the WB executives saw the alternate designs for Jim and Posey, he thought that they were the parents of Andy and Kevin. MacMullan states that the final design chosen for Posey looked &quot;much more attractive&quot; when compared to the two alternate designs.

In mid-1998, the WB officially announced that a 13 episode first season would begin airing in the fall of 1999, with the project being known as &quot;The Downtowners&quot; at this point. MTV&#x27;s production of the similarly titled adult animated series &quot;Downtown&quot; eventually forced a name change. It featured the voices of Wallace Langham, Scott Menville, Brian Posehn, Vicki Lewis, Nick Jameson, Tom Kenny, Herbert Sigüenza, Jane Wiedlin, Tress MacNeille and Lisa Kushell. The theme song is a faster, instrumental version of &quot;Italian Leather Sofa&quot; by Cake, who Oakley and Weinstein were fans of. This version was specifically recorded for the show. 

When the series was first sold to the WB, it was not yet synonymous with teen female-oriented drama programs such as &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Felicity&quot; and &quot;Roswell&quot;, and its only popular show with that demographic was &quot;Buffy&quot;, which premiered at the beginning of 1997. Prior to &quot;Buffy&quot;, the network had been focusing on live action comedy shows aimed at African-Americans, such as &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;, &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot; and &quot;The Parent &#x27;Hood&quot;. The success of &quot;Buffy&quot; and similar programs led to &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; labelling it as the &quot;teen girl network&quot; in July 1999, two months before &quot;Mission Hill&quot; premiered. During the WB&#x27;s 1999 upfront presentation to advertisers, the drama shows received applause from the advertisers in the audience, while &quot;Mission Hill&quot; was met with two minutes of silence. In 2017, Oakley claimed, &quot;In the time they ordered the show and the time it had appeared on the air, the network had redefined itself.&quot; He adds, &quot;they had this leftover programming, and by the time they figured out we shouldn’t be lumped in together [we] were in danger of killing that entire network. We hugely damaged the ratings of those other shows.&quot; In another 2024 interview, Oakley said he initially thought that there might be some crossover between the audience of &quot;Mission Hill&quot; and shows such as &quot;Buffy&quot;, adding that &quot;mostly at our urging, the show aired after an episode of &quot;Buffy&quot;, but all the &quot;Buffy&quot; viewers tuned out. They aired the next episode during their comedy block. We led off the night, and our ratings were so bad that we were murdering Jamie Foxx and Steve Harvey.&quot;

Although 18 episodes were planned, only 13 were produced. The series was put on hiatus by The WB after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned in the summer of 2000 with smaller promotion, and was canceled on July 18, 2000, after four more episodes aired to poor ratings. The series went on to develop a cult following, thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on Canada&#x27;s Teletoon (part of &quot;Unleashed&quot; block); Cartoon Network&#x27;s popular late-night programming block Adult Swim; and Too Funny to Sleep, a late-night programming block on TBS. Warner Home Video released all 13 completed episodes on DVD on November 29, 2005.

Bill Oakley has since voiced his dissatisfaction with the way Warner Bros. handled the series, and has said he doesn&#x27;t mind if people pirate the series.

===Potential revival===
On June 30, 2020, Oakley announced plans for a spin-off tentatively titled &quot;Gus and Wally&quot;, which will center on the middle-aged gay couple who were supporting characters in &quot;Mission Hill&quot;. It is set six months after the series&#x27; conclusion in the early 2000s, and will be produced by Warner Bros. Animation for contractual reasons, though it is unknown if it would be for the WBD-owned Max.

In June 2022, Oakley claimed that they were still in the process of pitching the project, and that if this version was picked up, then it would continue under the &quot;Mission Hill&quot; moniker, rather than being titled &quot;Gus and Wally&quot;. He also mentioned that it would include the unproduced episodes from the original incarnation of the show. 

In March 2023, Oakley confirmed in a tweet a Gus and Wally spin-off is &quot;not gonna happen&quot;.

==Premise==
Set in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.

==Characters==

===Main===
* Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; French (Wallace Langham) is a 24-year-old in his third consecutive &quot;post-college slump year.&quot; Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to &quot;Unemployment, Part 1,&quot; Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From &quot;Unemployment, Part 2&quot; to &quot;Plan 9 from Mission Hill&quot; (and including the unproduced episodes &quot;Supertool&quot; and &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others &quot;douchebag&quot;.
* Kevin French (Scott Menville) is Andy&#x27;s 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for Wyoming, bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill. He hopes to attend Yale University, and prides himself on his SAT scores. He has a habit of &quot;bling-blonging&quot;, saying &quot;bling blong&quot; over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters. Actor Andy Dick also auditioned for this role and was nearly cast.
* James &quot;Jim&quot; Kuback (Brian Posehn) – In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy&#x27;s best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it&#x27;s electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word &quot;Okay.&quot; Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to Generation Y.
* Posey Tyler (Vicki Lewis) – In her mid-20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.
* Stogie is Andy&#x27;s pet Golden Retriever, who can apparently stomach anything from alcoholic drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that &quot;there are dark forces at work within him&quot;, in the first episode.

===Supporting===
* Gus Duncz (Nick Jameson) is a gay man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally. According to audio commentary by the producers, Gus is based on Broderick Crawford, though according to the audio commentary for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; seventh-season episode, &quot;Marge Be Not Proud,&quot; Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was Lawrence Tierney (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).
* Wally Langford (Tom Kenny) is a gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a projectionist at the local art movie house. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode &quot;I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space&quot;, it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled &quot;The Man from Pluto&quot; (which parodied &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;). It starred his partner Gus in the title role. The character was based on David Niven and Wally Cox.
* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez (Vicki Lewis) – Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women&#x27;s Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is Jewish. She is a working mother who supports both &quot;Baby Nameless&quot; and her non-working &quot;marital partner&quot; Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator Lois M. Leveen, a longtime friend of the show&#x27;s creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more &quot;Lois-y&quot; than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.
* Carlos Hernandez (Herbert Sigüenza) – Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and stay-at-home dad for Baby Nameless. Unlike his religious wife Natalie, Carlos is a Christian, his work is, at times, reminiscent of Jackson Pollock, Diego Rivera and Bob Ross. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.
* Baby Nameless (Mary Oakley) – The newborn baby of Natalie and Carlos. She was modelled after and voiced by Bill Oakley&#x27;s daughter Mary, who was born in June 1998, while the show was in production.
* Gwen (Jane Wiedlin) – Early 20s. Andy&#x27;s on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron&#x27;s Waterbed World. Someday she would like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes The Go-Go&#x27;s, referring to Wiedlin&#x27;s membership in the band.
* Toby Mundorf (Josh Weinstein) – In his late teens and one of Kevin&#x27;s best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.
* George Bang (Bill Oakley) is Kevin&#x27;s other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father&#x27;s market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing video games. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don&#x27;t seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.
* Ron (Nick Jameson) is a sleazy, immoral Armenian man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him). In &quot;Unemployment, Part 1,&quot; Ron was arrested and sentenced to five years imprisonment for tax evasion, his store was also confiscated by the government as a result. He has an extremely short temper and often takes his rage out on his employees.

==Episodes==
Note: Thirteen episodes of the series were produced while five more were written, but never completed. Animatics for some of these episodes were in production at the time of the series&#x27; cancellation. It was planned to put these animatics on the DVD for the series, but this never came to fruition. However, several of the animatics—including a completed video animatic and synchronized audio read-through of the episode &quot;Pretty in Pink (Crap Gets in Your Eyes)&quot;—have been released through various internet outlets.
===Unfinished episodes===
==Location==
The series takes place in a district named Mission Hill. Mission Hill is a distinctive neighborhood in a much larger city named Cosmopolis. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban metropolis similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of Mission Hill in Boston (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, Silver Lake in Los Angeles, Wicker Park in Chicago, and Williamsburg in Brooklyn. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of East and West Coast cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart.

==Home release==

Warner Home Video released all 13 completed episodes on DVD on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; by R.E.M. in the episode &quot;Andy Vs. The Real World&quot;. The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy&#x27;s voice track from saying &quot;Gordon Lightfoot&quot; to &quot;Scott Joplin&quot; in the episode &quot;Unemployment Part 1&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Mission Hill&quot; received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for &quot;Best Series for All Audiences&quot;; the award cited the series&#x27; &quot;stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.&quot;

The series won an award from GLAAD for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.

<text>Donn Fulton Eisele (June 23, 1930 – December 1, 1987) (Colonel USAF) was a United States Air Force officer, test pilot, and later a NASA astronaut. He served as command module pilot for the Apollo 7 mission in 1968. After retiring from both NASA and the Air Force in 1972, he became the Peace Corps country director for Thailand, before moving into private business.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Eisele was born June 23, 1930, in Columbus, Ohio, to Herman Eugene Eisele (1899–1964) and Lee Ila June Eisele ( Davisson; 1900–1964). He graduated from West High School in 1948. He was an active Boy Scout and earned the rank of Еagle Scout. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1952, and chose a commission in the United States Air Force. He received a Master of Science degree in Astronautics from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, in 1960.

===Flight experience===
Following his commission, Eisele was sent to flight training. He was trained at Goodfellow Air Force Base, Texas, Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, and Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. After receiving his pilot wings in 1954, Eisele served four years as an interceptor pilot in South Dakota and in Libya until 1958. He attended and graduated from the U.S. Air Force Experimental Test Pilot School (Class 62A) at Edwards Air Force Base, California, in 1962; his classmates included Charles Bassett and Theodore Freeman. Eisele was a project engineer and experimental test pilot at the Air Force Special Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico. He flew experimental test flights in support of special weapons development programs. He logged more than 4,200 hours flying time, 3,600 of which were in jet aircraft.

===NASA career===

Eisele was part of NASA&#x27;s third group of astronauts, selected in October 1963. In early 1966, Eisele was quietly selected as pilot for the Apollo 1 crew, along with Command Pilot Virgil I. &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom and Senior Pilot Ed White. But after dislocating his shoulder twice during training in January 1966, Eisele was replaced by Roger B. Chaffee. After corrective surgery on January 27, Eisele was named to the crew for the second crewed Apollo flight, with Command Pilot Walter &quot;Wally&quot; Schirra and Pilot Walter Cunningham. At this time, Eisele was promoted to the Senior Pilot position.

In December 1966, Apollo 2 was canceled on the grounds that it would be an unnecessary repeat of Apollo 1, and Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham became the backups to Grissom&#x27;s crew. But after Grissom, White, and Chaffee were killed in the Apollo 1 spacecraft fire of January 27, 1967, Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were named to fly the first crewed Apollo mission instead. It would ultimately be called Apollo 7.

As the launch date approached, Eisele&#x27;s participation was at risk; he was having an extramarital affair with a woman who would later become his second wife. Astronaut Office Chief Deke Slayton had warned the crew that they were all &quot;expendable&quot;, and that any extramarital affairs must not become public.

Eisele remained on the crew, and on October 11, 1968, Apollo 7 was launched on an 11-day mission—the first crewed flight test of the third generation United States spacecraft. By this time, the Senior Pilot title was changed to Command Module Pilot. Together with spacecraft commander Schirra and Lunar Module Pilot Cunningham, Eisele performed simulated transposition and docking maneuvers with the upper stage of their Saturn IB launch vehicle, and acted as navigator, taking star sightings and aligning the spacecraft&#x27;s guidance and navigation platform. The crew completed eight successful test firing maneuvers of the service module&#x27;s propulsion engine. They also tested the performance of all spacecraft systems and broadcast the first live televised coverage of crew activities.

Apollo 7 was placed in a geocentric orbit with an apogee of and perigee of . The 260-hour, 4.5 million mile (7.25 Gm; 7.25 million km) shakedown flight was successfully concluded on October 22, 1968, with splashdown occurring in the Atlantic, 8 miles (15 km) from the carrier USS &quot;Essex&quot; and only from the predicted target. Eisele logged 260 hours in space.

Eisele served as backup Command Module Pilot for the 1969 Apollo 10 flight. Eisele resigned from the Astronaut Office in 1970 and became technical assistant for crewed spaceflight at the NASA Langley Research Center, a position he occupied until retiring from both NASA and the Air Force in 1972.

===Post-NASA career===
In July 1972, Eisele became Country Director of the U.S. Peace Corps in Thailand. Returning from Thailand two years later, he became Sales Manager for Marion Power Shovel, a division of Dresser Industries. Eisele then handled private and corporate accounts for the investment firm of Oppenheimer &amp; Company.

In 1980, Eisele moved to Wilton Manors, Florida. In 1981, Eisele was appointed to a vacant seat on the Wilton Manors City Commission, and served in that political office for roughly one year. After Eisele&#x27;s death, the City of Wilton Manors named Donn Eisele Park in his memory.

Eisele was a guide in the 1986 Concorde Comet Chase flights out of Miami and New York City.

===Death===

In 1987, at the age of 57, Eisele died of a heart attack while on a business trip to Tokyo, Japan, where he was to attend the opening of a new Space Camp patterned on the one at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Eisele was cremated in Japan, and his ashes were buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.

==Organizations==
Eisele was an Eagle Scout, a member of Tau Beta Pi, and a Freemason, belonging to Luther B. Turner Lodge # 732 in Columbus, Ohio.

==Awards and honors==
Among the honors he received during his career were the NASA Exceptional Service Medal, the Air Force Senior Pilot Astronaut Wings, and the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross. He was a co-recipient of the AIAA 1969 Haley Astronautics Award and was presented the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Special Trustees Award in 1969.

Eisele was a part of a group of Apollo astronauts to be inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. He was one of 24 Apollo astronauts who were inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2008, NASA posthumously awarded Eisele the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for his Apollo 7 mission.

==Legacy==
A family-approved account of Donn Eisele&#x27;s life appears in the 2007 book &quot;In the Shadow of the Moon&quot;. Eisele&#x27;s posthumously discovered memoir &quot;Apollo Pilot&quot; was published by University of Nebraska Press in 2017.

In the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Eisele was portrayed by John Mese. In the final three episodes of the 2015 ABC television series &quot;The Astronaut Wives Club&quot;, Eisele was portrayed by Ryan Doom.

Susan Eisele Black donated a sample of a Moon rock to Broward County Main Library on behalf of her late husband, on October 23, 2007. Broward County Library, located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is the only library in the United States to have a lunar rock on display. The precious Moon rock is typically exhibited at science museums and schools.

The first edition of &quot;The Stage&quot; was published (under the title The Stage Directory – a London and Provincial Theatrical Advertiser) on 1 February 1880 at a cost of three old pence for twelve pages. Publication was monthly until 25 March 1881, when the first weekly edition was produced. At the same time, the name was shortened to &quot;The Stage&quot; and the publication numbering restarted at number 1.

The publication was a joint venture between founding editor Charles Lionel Carson and business manager Maurice Comerford. It operated from offices opposite the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Carson, whose real name was Lionel Courtier-Dutton, was cited as the founder. His wife Emily Courtier Dutton later founded several theatrical charities.

&quot;The Stage&quot; entered a crowded market, with many other theatre titles (including &quot;The Era&quot;) in circulation. Undercutting their rivals, Carson and Comerford dropped the price of the paper to one penny; soon it became the only remaining title in the field.

The newspaper has remained in family ownership. Upon the death in 1937 of Charles Carson&#x27;s son Lionel, who had assumed the joint role of managing director and editor, control passed to the Comerford family.

In 1959, the newspaper was renamed The Stage and Television Today, incorporating the &quot;Television Today&quot; pull-out supplement dedicated to broadcasting news and features. Derek Hoddinott, who was the existing TV editor of &quot;The Stage&quot;, was retitled as editor of the &quot;Television Today&quot; supplement. The overall name and pull-out supplement remained until 1995, when broadcasting coverage was re-incorporated into the main paper. The name on the masthead reverted to &quot;The Stage&quot;, but in 2006, the paper introduced a blog concentrating on television, named &quot;TV Today&quot;.

From 1995, the newspaper has awarded The Stage Awards for Acting Excellence at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

In 2004, 96-year-old contributor Simon Blumenfeld was recognised by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s oldest weekly newspaper columnist. The column continued until shortly before his death in 2005.

The Stage Awards were launched in 2010. They are given annually and recognise outstanding organisations working in theatre and beyond in the following categories: London theatre, regional theatre, producer, school, fringe theatre, theatre building, unsung hero and international.

In August 2013, &quot;The Stage&quot; launched The Stage Castings, an online casting service with a video audition function.

In May 2019, &quot;The Stage&quot; partnered with the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation and UK Theatre to launch Get Into Theatre, a website dedicated to theatre careers.

==Careers started via &quot;The Stage&quot;==
In 1956, writer John Osborne submitted his script for &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; in response to an advertisement by the soon-to-be-relaunched Royal Court Theatre.

Dusty Springfield responded to an advertisement for female singers in 1958.

Idris Elba got his first acting role in a play after applying to a job ad in the paper.

Harold Pinter gained his first job after responding to an advert and Kenneth Branagh landed the lead in &quot;The Billy Trilogy&quot;, in the BBC &quot;Play for Today&quot; series, after it was advertised in the paper.

The creation of Internationalist Theatre was first announced in the Stage editorial in April 1981.

Ricky Tomlinson responded to an ad for &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, another &quot;Play for Today&quot;, in 1981 and Sandi Toksvig landed her first television job playing the part of Ethel in &quot;No. 73&quot; after answering an ad in &quot;The Stage&quot;.

Television presenter Maggie Philbin won her first major role, as a co-presenter of &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot;, after answering an advertisement in &quot;The Stage&quot;.

A number of pop groups have recruited all or some of their members through advertisements placed in the newspaper, most notably the Spice Girls in 1994, Scooch in 1998 and 5ive in 1997. Lee Mead (the actor who won BBC One talent show &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; to gain the lead role in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;) got his first professional job, working on a cruise ship, through a recruitment ad in the paper.

Television presenter Ben Shephard auditioned for GMTV children&#x27;s show Diggit following an advert in &quot;The Stage&quot;. While he did not get the part, he met Andi Peters, who subsequently hired him for the Channel 4 youth strand T4.

Charles Dance landed his first role in a Welsh theatre and Alexandra Burke stated in an interview &quot;My mum used to buy &quot;The Stage&quot; all the time for auditions for me. That&#x27;s how I got to go on [BBC TV talent show] &quot;Star for a Night&quot; with Jane McDonald.&quot;

Olivier Award-winning actor Sharon D. Clarke found her first role at Battersea Arts Centre through an audition advert in the paper.

<text>Anthony Wayne &quot;Tony&quot; England (born May 15, 1942) is an American former NASA astronaut. Selected in 1967, England was among a group of astronauts who served as backups during the Apollo and Skylab programs. Like most others in his class, he flew during the Space Shuttle program, serving as a mission specialist on STS-51-F in 1985. He has logged more than 4,000 hours of flying time and 188 hours in space.

England helped develop and use radars to probe the Moon on Apollo 17 and glaciers in Washington and Alaska. He participated in and led field parties during two seasons in Antarctica.

England was formerly dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Dearborn campus.

==Biography==
===Early years and education===
England was born May 15, 1942, in Indianapolis, Indiana, but his hometown is West Fargo, North Dakota. He attended primary school in Indianapolis, Indiana, and graduated from high school in North Dakota. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) he received his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Earth and planetary sciences (course 12A) in 1965, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Earth and planetary sciences in 1970. England was a graduate fellow at MIT for the three years immediately preceding his first assignment to NASA.

===Career===
England was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August 1967, as part of the 6th astronaut selection. At 25 years 81 days old, he was the youngest candidate to be selected up to that time. He subsequently completed the initial academic training and a 53-week course in flight training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas. He received his wings with distinguished honors in April 1969. England served as a support crewman for the Apollo 13 and 16 flights. He was also an EVA CapCom during the Apollo 16 mission, talking to the astronauts while they explored the surface of the Moon. Notably, he developed and communicated instructions for construction of the lithium hydroxide canisters on Apollo 13.

England and Philip Chapman resigned from NASA in 1972, citing a decline in crewed missions. Neither had flown in space at that point. England joined the U.S. Geological Survey.

He was deputy chief of the Office of Geochemistry and Geophysics for the U.S. Geological Survey, and associate editor for the &quot;Journal of Geophysical Research&quot;. He served on the National Academy&#x27;s Space Studies Board, and on several federal committees concerned with Antarctic policy, nuclear waste containment, and federal science and technology.

England returned to the Johnson Space Center in 1979 as a senior scientist-astronaut (mission specialist), was assigned to the operation mission development group of the Astronaut Office, and eventually managed that group.

====Space Shuttle flight====
STS-51-F, carrying a seven-man crew and Spacelab-2, was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida on July 29, 1985. This mission was the first pallet-only Spacelab mission and the first mission to operate the Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS). It carried 13 major experiments of which seven were in the field of astronomy and solar physics, three were for studies of the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere, two were life science experiments, and 1 studied the properties of superfluid helium. England was responsible for activating and operating the Spacelab systems, operating the IPS and the Remote Manipulator System, assisting with experiment operations, and performing a contingency EVA had one been necessary. After 126 orbits of the Earth, STS 51-F &quot;Challenger&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 6, 1985.

From May 1986 to May 1987, England served as a program scientist for Space Station Freedom (which later evolved into the International Space Station). From June 1987 to December 1987, he taught Remote Sensing Geophysics at Rice University. England retired from NASA in 1988.

===Post-NASA career===
England was the dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science and professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan–Dearborn. He is also a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and atmospheric, oceanic, and of space sciences in the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. England also served as a member of the Michigan Pipeline Safety Advisory Board and the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority.

===Personal===
England was married for 51 years to his childhood sweetheart, Kathi (Kreutz) until her death in 2013 and has two daughters: Heidi and Heather. He has five grandchildren: Brandi, Spenser, Charlene, Brock, Sage.. His recreational interests include sailing and amateur radio.

England&#x27;s career is chronicled in the book &quot;NASA&#x27;s Scientist-Astronauts&quot; by David Shayler and Colin Burgess.

<text>The Weather Girls are an American female duo whose best-known line-up comprised Martha Wash and Izora Armstead. Formed in 1976 in San Francisco, California, Wash and Armstead began their musical careers as Two Tons O&#x27; Fun, the female backup duo for disco singer Sylvester. After several years of singing background for Sylvester, the duo was signed in 1979 to Fantasy Records as Two Tons O&#x27; Fun. The duo changed their name to The Weather Girls and were launched into somewhat more mainstream recognition following the release of the single, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; (1982), which became their first number-one song on the US Dance Chart and their biggest hit. Despite having several hit songs on the Dance Chart as Two Tons O&#x27; Fun and The Weather Girls, the duo never achieved a top 40 hit on the main US Hot 100 and ultimately disbanded in 1988 after the release of their self-titled fifth album &quot;The Weather Girls&quot;.

In 1991, Armstead reformed the duo with her daughter Dynelle Rhodes. Over the course of a decade, the Armstead and Rhodes released three albums: &quot;Double Tons of Fun&quot; (1993), &quot;Think Big!&quot;, and &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Hits&quot; (1999). In 2004, Armstead died due to heart failure and was replaced with singer Ingrid Arthur in 2005. Following the release of two albums &quot;Totally Wild!&quot; (2005) and &quot;The Woman I Am&quot; (2009), Arthur left the group and was replaced with singer Dorrey Lin Lyles in 2012.

As the Weather Girls with Martha Wash and Izora Armstead, the duo received a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1983.

==History==
===1970–1975: Formation and early years===
Izora Rhodes and Martha Wash met at a young age. Wash attended Church of God in Christ, which was an alley away from the Baptist church Rhodes was attending. Rhodes was the lead vocalist and pianist of the San Francisco Inspirational Choir. Wash and Rhodes eventually landed in a gospel group called N.O.W. (News of the World). While performing part-time in the group, Wash worked as a secretary for UC Hospital while Rhodes worked as a bartender and a nurse assistant. Rhodes also worked as a piano and vocal teacher.

===1976–1979: Sylvester and the Two Tons o&#x27; Fun===
In February 1976, Wash auditioned as a backup singer before American singer-songwriter Sylvester and his manager Brent Thomson. Impressed with her vocal performance, Sylvester inquired if she had another large black friend who could sing, after which she introduced him to Izora Rhodes. Although he referred to them simply as &quot;the girls&quot;, Wash and Rhodes formed a musical duo called Two Tons O&#x27; Fun. Two Tons O&#x27; Fun debuted as Sylvester&#x27;s backing vocalists on his self-titled third album &quot;Sylvester&quot;, released in 1977. The duo sang backup vocals on the album&#x27;s singles &quot;Down, Down, Down&quot; and &quot;Over and Over&quot;; the former charted at number eighteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance chart.

In 1978, Sylvester released his fourth album &quot;Step II&quot;, in which The Two Tons also contributed background vocals throughout the album. They performed backing vocals on the singles &quot;Dance (Disco Heat)&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; which both peaked at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Dance chart. In 1979, the duo secured their own record deal with Fantasy Records. That same year, Two Tons O&#x27; Fun sang background on Sylvester&#x27;s live album &quot;Living Proof&quot;, one of their final performances together. As they began to work on their own album, the duo appeared in fewer shows with Sylvester.

===1980–1981: Debut album and &quot;Backatcha&quot;===
On January 24, 1980, the duo released their debut self-titled album &quot;Two Tons o&#x27; Fun&quot;. The album spawned two top-five dance singles: &quot;Earth Can Be Just Like Heaven&quot; and &quot;I Got the Feeling&quot;. Shortly after the release of the album, they changed their name to The Two Tons after being informed that an Oklahoma gospel act had already registered the group name &quot;Two Tons o Fun&quot; with ASCAP since 1958. Their second album &quot;Backatcha&quot; was released later that year. The album spawned a single &quot;I Depend On You&quot; that peaked at number seventy-two on the Dance chart. The follow-up single &quot;Never Like This&quot; peaked at number fifty-five on the R&amp;B chart.

===1982–1988: The Weather Girls and breakthrough===
In September 1982, the duo released their single &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;, and changed their duo title to The Weather Girls, a name chosen as a pun on the song&#x27;s subject. The song became their biggest hit to date, peaking at number one on the Dance chart and number forty-six on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 chart. The song also peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, and became certified Silver-status for sales exceeding 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; received a nomination at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards (1983) for Best R&amp;B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal. On January 22, 1983, they released their third album &quot;Success&quot;. Despite the overall success of the album&#x27;s lead single, the album experienced mild success. The album&#x27;s title-track &quot;Success&quot; was released as the second single and peaked at number eighty-nine on the R&amp;B chart. Two additional singles, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair&quot; and &quot;Dear Santa (Bring Me a Man This Christmas)&quot;, were also released but failed to chart.

In 1984, The Weather Girls performed backing vocals on the million-selling single &quot;Centipede&quot; by Rebbie Jackson. The song was written, arranged, and produced by Michael Jackson, who also sang background vocals on the song. It reached number 4 on the Black Singles Chart and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1985, The Weather Girls released their fourth album &quot;Big Girls Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. The album&#x27;s singles &quot;Well-A-Wiggy&quot; and &quot;No One Can Love You More Than Me&quot; experienced moderate success and had poor promotion. In 1988, The Weather Girls released their self-titled fifth album &quot;The Weather Girls&quot;, party produced by Full Force and Reggie Lucas, which was ultimately seen as a commercial failure by their record label. Shortly after the album, The Weather Girls disbanded and Wash took up a solo career and also began working as a session vocalist.

===1991–2003: Reformation===
After a three-year hiatus and Wash pursuing her solo career, Armstead reformed The Weather Girls with her daughter Dynelle Rhodes and relocated to Germany in 1991. Their first album together &quot;Double Tons of Fun&quot; was released in 1993. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Can You Feel It&quot; peaked at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Dance chart. The song also peaked at number 75 on Germany&#x27;s music chart, their second single to enter that chart since &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;. While touring the club circuit, the album&#x27;s third single &quot;We Shall All Be Free&quot; peaked at number 80 on Germany&#x27;s music chart. Their follow-up album &quot;Think Big!&quot; was released in December 1995. The album saw Armstead&#x27;s contribution as a songwriter and penning several songs, including the album&#x27;s third single &quot;The Sound of Sex (Ooh Gitchie O-La-La-Ay)&quot;, which was written with her daughter. The album also contained a cover version of Sylvester&#x27;s 1979 disco hit &quot;Stars&quot;, recorded as a duet with Scottish pop singer Jimmy Somerville.

In 1999, The Weather Girls released their eighth studio album &quot;Puttin&#x27; On The Hits&quot;, which contained a collection of covered disco songs. The non-album track &quot;Big Brown Girl&quot; was released as a single in 1999. In 2002, they joined the Disco Brothers for participation in the German National Final for the Eurovision Song Contest with their song &quot;Get Up&quot;. In the end, the group only managed a 13th place out of 15.

===2004–2012: Lineup change===
On September 16, 2004, Izora Armstead died of heart failure at age 62. Prior to Armstead&#x27;s passing, new member Ingrid Arthur joined The Weather Girls in 2004. Following Armstead&#x27;s passing, they released the album &quot;Totally Wild&quot;. It scored an underground club hit with the single &quot;Wild Thang&quot; in 2004. In 2006, Joan Faulkner began performing with Rhodes and often substituting for Arthur. In 2008, the Weather Girls released a single &quot;Break You&quot;, which topped the Dance chart. In 2009, the duo released a new studio album titled &quot;The Woman I Am&quot;. In 2012, The Weather Girls released &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men 2K12&quot;, a newly recorded version of their 1982 hit, produced by Sebo Reed. In the same year, Arthur departed from The Weather Girls to focus on her solo career. Dorrey Lin Lyles, a singer who had worked with the duo in the past, was added to the duo in mid-2012.

===2013–present: Recent activity===
The Weather Girls began touring internationally in 2013. In 2018, they released a new single &quot;We Need Love&quot;, produced by Torsten Abrolat, Terri B! and featuring, Jason Anousheh.

==Legacy==
Widely associated with their biggest song &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;, VH1 ranked the song at thirty-five on their list of the 100 Greatest Dance Songs in 2000, and also at thirty-five in their 100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 1980s in 2009. &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; ranked the song twelve in their list of The 60 Best Dancefloor Classics in February 2017.

&quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot; has often been perceived as a gay anthem. A campaign in Facebook was launched on January 19, 2014, to get the song to UK number one in response to a UKIP councillor blaming recent UK floods and adverse weather on divine retribution for the British government&#x27;s introduction of gay marriage. The campaign was reported widely and The Weather Girls&#x27; version reached number 21 on the first day of the chart week. The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart in 2014 at number 31. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the song on their 25 Essential LGBTQ Pride Songs list. In 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song at number forty-seven on their The 50 Best Gay Anthems Of All Time list. &quot;The Gay UK&quot; ranked the song at number two on their Top 40 Gay Anthems for Pride list.

To date, The Weather Girls have accumulated an overall total of four number-one dance singles. Dynelle Rhodes holds the rights to the Weather Girls name and performs across Europe.

The human [[Female reproductive system|female reproductive system]] is made up of the internal and external [[sex organ]]s that function in the [[Human reproduction|reproduction]] of new [[offspring]]. The reproductive system is immature at birth and develops at [[puberty]] to be able to release matured [[ova]] from the [[ovary|ovaries]], facilitate their [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], and create a protective environment for the developing [[fetus]] during [[pregnancy]]. The [[Female reproductive system|female reproductive tract]] is made of several connected internal sex organs—the [[vagina]], [[uterus]], and [[fallopian tube]]s—and is prone to infections. The vagina allows for [[sexual intercourse]], and is connected to the uterus at the [[cervix]]. The uterus (or womb) accommodates the [[embryo]] by developing the [[uterine lining]].

The uterus also produces secretions which help the transit of [[sperm]] to the fallopian tubes, where sperm fertilize the ova. During the [[menstrual cycle]], the ovaries release an ovum, which transits through the fallopian tube into the uterus. If an egg cell meets with sperm on its way to the uterus, a single sperm cell can enter and merge with it, creating a [[zygote]]. If no fertilization occurs, [[menstruation]] is the process by which the uterine lining is shed as blood, mucus, and tissue.

Fertilization usually occurs in the fallopian tubes and marks the beginning of [[human embryogenesis|embryogenesis]]. The zygote will then [[Mitosis|divide]] over enough generations of cells to form a [[blastocyst]], which [[implantation (embryo)|implants]] itself in the wall of the uterus. This begins the period of [[gestation]] and the embryo will continue to [[prenatal development|develop]] until [[pregnancy#Childbirth maturity stages|full-term]]. When the [[Fetal viability|fetus has developed enough to survive outside the uterus]], the cervix dilates, and [[Childbirth|contractions of the uterus propel it through the birth canal]] (the vagina), where it becomes a [[newborn]]. The [[breasts]] are not part of the reproductive system, but [[mammary gland]]s were essential to nourishing infants until the modern advent of [[infant formula]].

Later in life, a woman goes through [[menopause]] and menstruation halts. The ovaries stop releasing eggs and the uterus stops preparing for pregnancy.

The external sex organs are also known as the &quot;genitals&quot;, and these are the organs of the [[vulva]], including the [[labia]], [[clitoris]], and [[vulval vestibule|vestibule]]. The corresponding equivalent among males is the [[human male reproductive system|male reproductive system]].

==External genitalia==

===Vulva===
The vulva is of all of the external parts and tissues and includes the following: 

*[[Clitoris]]: an organ located at the top of the vulva. It consists of the [[Clitoris#Body|body]] and its pea-shaped [[Clitoris#Glans|glans]] that is protected by the [[clitoral hood]]. The [[Corpus cavernosum of clitoris|corpora cavernosa]] are tissues of the clitoris that aid in [[Clitoral erection|erection]] by filling with blood during [[sexual arousal]].
*[[Labia]]: two types of vertical folds of skin called the [[labia majora]] (thick and large outer folds that protect other parts of the vulva) and the [[labia minora]] (thin and small inner folds that protect the vestibule from dryness, infections and irritation).
*[[Mons pubis]]: a mass of [[Adipose tissue|fatty tissue]] where the [[pubic hair]] grows.
*[[Vulval vestibule]]: an almond-shaped area between the labia minora that contains the openings.
*[[Urinary meatus]]: the opening of the [[Urethra#Female|urethra]] for [[urine]] to pass through.
*[[Human vagina#Vaginal opening and hymen|Vaginal opening]]: entrance to the vagina.
*[[Hymen]]: [[connective tissue]] that covers the vaginal opening.
* Vestibular gland openings: two pairs of openings in the vulval vestibule for the [[Bartholin&#x27;s gland|Bartholin&#x27;s]] and [[Skene&#x27;s gland]]s.

The vagina is a fibromuscular (made up of fibrous and muscular tissue) [[Human vagina#Structure|canal]] leading from the outside of the body to the cervix of the uterus. It is also referred to as the birth canal in the context of [[pregnancy]]. The vagina accommodates a [[human penis|penis]] during [[sexual intercourse]]. [[Semen]] containing [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] is [[ejaculation|ejaculated]] from the penis at [[orgasm]], into the vagina potentially enabling [[Human fertilization|fertilization]] of the [[egg cell]] (ovum) to take place.

===Cervix===
The cervix is the neck of the uterus, the lower, narrow portion where it joins with the upper part of the vagina. It is [[cylindrical]] or [[cone (geometry)|conical]] in shape and protrudes through the upper anterior vaginal wall. Approximately half its length is visible, the remainder lies above the vagina beyond view. The vagina has a thick layer outside and it is the opening where the fetus emerges during delivery.

===Uterus===
The uterus or womb is the major female reproductive [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]. The uterus provides mechanical protection, nutritional support, and waste removal for the developing embryo (weeks 1 to 8) and fetus (from week 9 until the delivery). In addition, contractions in the muscular wall of the uterus are important in pushing out the fetus at the time of birth.

The uterus contains three suspensory ligaments that help stabilize the position of the uterus and limits its range of movement. The [[uterosacral ligament]]s keep the body from moving inferiorly and anteriorly. The [[Round ligament of uterus|round ligament]]s restrict posterior movement of the uterus. The [[cardinal ligament]]s also prevent the inferior movement of the uterus.

The uterus is a pear-shaped [[muscle|muscular]] organ. Its major function is to accept a fertilized ovum, which becomes implanted into the [[endometrium]], and derives nourishment from blood vessels, which develop exclusively for this purpose. The fertilized ovum becomes an [[embryo]], develops into a [[fetus]] and gestates until [[childbirth]]. If the egg does not embed in the wall of the uterus, the female begins [[menstruation]].

===Fallopian tubes===
The fallopian tubes are two tubes leading from the ovaries into the uterus. On maturity of an ovum, the follicle and the ovary&#x27;s wall rupture, allowing the ovum to escape and enter the fallopian tube. There it travels toward the uterus, pushed along by movements of [[cilia]] on the inner lining of the tubes. This trip takes hours or days. If the ovum is fertilized while in the fallopian tube, then it normally implants in the [[endometrium]] when it reaches the uterus, which signals the beginning of [[pregnancy]].

===Ovaries===
The ovaries are small, paired [[gonad]]s located near the lateral walls of the pelvic cavity. These organs are responsible for the production of the [[egg cell]]s (ova) and the secretion of hormones. The process by which the egg cell (ovum) is released is called [[ovulation]]. The speed of ovulation is [[Frequency|periodic]] and impacts the length of a [[menstrual cycle]].

After ovulation, the egg cell travels through the fallopian tube toward the uterus. If fertilization is going to occur, it often happens in the fallopian tube; the fertilized egg can then implant on the uterus&#x27;s lining. During fertilization the egg cell plays a role; it releases certain molecules that are essential to guiding the sperm and allows the surface of the egg to attach to the sperm&#x27;s surface. The egg can then absorb the sperm and fertilization can begin.

===Vestibular glands===
The vestibular glands, also known as the female accessory glands, are the Bartholin&#x27;s glands, which produce a [[Mucus|mucous]] fluid for [[vaginal lubrication]], and the Skene&#x27;s glands for the [[Female ejaculation|ejaculation]] of fluid as well as for lubricating the meatus.

==Function==
The female reproductive system functions to [[Human reproduction|produce]] [[offspring]].

In the absence of fertilization, the ovum will eventually traverse the entire reproductive tract from the fallopian tube until exiting the vagina through [[menstruation]].

The reproductive tract can be used for various [[transluminal procedure]]s such as [[fertiloscopy]], [[intrauterine insemination]], and transluminal [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]].

[[Oocyte]]s residing in the [[folliculogenesis|primordial follicle]] of the ovary are in a non-growing [[prophase]] arrested state, but are capable of highly efficient [[homologous recombination]]al repair of [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damages]] including double-strand breaks. This capability allows [[genome]] integrity to be maintained and offspring health to be protected.

==Development==

Chromosome characteristics determine the genetic sex of a fetus at [[Human fertilization|conception]]. This is specifically based on the 23rd pair of chromosomes that is inherited. Since the mother&#x27;s egg contains an X chromosome and the father&#x27;s sperm contains either an X or Y [[chromosome]], it is the male who determines the fetus&#x27; sex. If the fetus inherits the X chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a female. In this case, [[testosterone]] is not made and the [[Wolffian duct]] will degrade thus, the [[Müllerian duct]] will develop into female sex organs. The [[clitoris]] is the remnants of the Wolffian duct. On the other hand, if the fetus inherits the Y chromosome from the father, the fetus will be a male. The presence of testosterone will stimulate the Wolffian duct, which will bring about the development of the male sex organs and the Müllerian duct will degrade.

==Clinical significance==
=== Vaginitis ===
[[Vaginitis]] is inflammation of the vagina and largely caused by an infection. It is the most common gynaecological condition presented. It is difficult to determine any one organism most responsible for vaginitis because it varies from range of age, sexual activity, and method of microbial identification. Vaginitis is not necessarily caused by a [[sexually transmitted infection]] as there are many infectious agents that make use of the close proximity to mucous membranes and secretions. Vaginitis is usually diagnosed based on the presence of vaginal discharge, which can have a certain color, odor, or quality.

=== Bacterial vaginosis ===

This is a vaginal infection in women. It differs from vaginitis in that there is no inflammation. Bacterial vaginosis is polymicrobial, consisting of many [[bacteria]] species. The diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis is made if three of the following four criteria are present: (1) Homogenous, thin discharge, (2) a [[pH]] of 4.5 in the vagina, (3) [[epithelial cells]] in the vagina with bacteria attached to them, or (4) a fishy odor. It has been associated with an increased risk of other genital tract infections such as [[endometritis]].

=== Yeast infection ===

This is a common cause of vaginal irritation and according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] at least 75% of adult women have experienced one at least once in their lifetime. Yeast infections are caused by an overgrowth of fungus in the vagina known as [[Candidiasis|Candida]]. Yeast infections are usually caused by an imbalance of the pH in the vagina, which is usually acidic. Other factors such as pregnancy, diabetes, weakened immune systems, tight fitting clothing, or [[douching]] can also be a cause. Symptoms of yeast infections include itching, burning, irritation, and a white cottage-cheese-like discharge from the vagina. Women have also reported that they experience painful intercourse and urination as well. Taking a sample of the vaginal secretions and placing them under a microscope for evidence of yeast can diagnose a yeast infection. Treatment varies from creams that can be applied in or around the vaginal area to oral tablets that stop the growth of fungus.

===Genital mutilation===

There are many practices of mutilating female genitalia in different cultures. The most common two types of genital mutilation practiced are [[clitoridectomy]], the circumcision of the clitoris and the excision of the [[Clitoral hood|clitoral prepuce]]. They can all involve a range of adverse health consequences such as [[bleeding]], irreparable tissue damage, and [[sepsis]], which can sometimes prove fatal.

===Genital surgery===

[[Genitoplasty]] refers to surgery that is carried out to repair damaged sex organs particularly following cancer and its treatment.
There are also [[Elective surgery|elective surgical]] procedures, which change the appearance of the external genitals.

===Birth control===
There are many types of birth control available to females. Birth control can be hormonal or physical in nature. Oral contraception can assist with management of various medical conditions, such as menorrhagia. However, oral contraceptives can have a variety of side effects, including depression.

==Reproductive rights==

The [[International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics]] was founded in 1954 to promote the well-being of women particularly in raising the standards of gynaecological practice and care. As of 2010, there were 124 countries involved.

[[Reproductive rights]] are legal rights related to reproduction and [[reproductive health]]. Women have the right to control matters involving their sexuality including their sexual and reproductive health. Violation of these rights include [[forced pregnancy]], [[forced sterilization]], [[forced abortion]] and [[female genital mutilation|genital mutilation]]. Female genital mutilation is the complete or partial removal of a female&#x27;s external [[genitals]].

==History==
It is claimed in the [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] writings that both males and females contribute their seed to conception; otherwise, children would not resemble either or both of their parents. Four hundred years later, [[Galen]] identified the source of &#x27;female semen&#x27; as the ovaries in female reproductive organs.
