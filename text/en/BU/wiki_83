<text>Number 23 Squadron is a squadron of the Royal Air Force responsible for &#x27;day-to-day space operations&#x27;, having been reformed in January 2021, as the first &quot;space squadron&quot;. Up until its disbandment in October 2009, it operated the Boeing Sentry AEW1 Airborne Warning And Control System (AWACS) aircraft from RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire.

==History==

===First World War===
No. 23 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps was formed at Fort Grange, Gosport on 1 September 1915, commanded by Louis Strange and equipped with a mixture of types. A detachment of Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2C&#x27;s were deployed to Sutton&#x27;s Farm to act as night fighters to oppose raids by German Zeppelins, but no successful interceptions resulted. The squadron moved to France on 16 March 1916 flying FE2b two-seat pusher fighters. The squadron used the FE2b on close-escort duties and to fly standing patrols to engage hostile aircraft wherever they could be found, helping to establish air superiority in the build-up to the Battle of the Somme.

By the end of the year the &quot;Fee&quot; was obsolete, and the Squadron started to receive Spad S.VII single-seat fighters in February 1917, with its last F.E.2s in April 1917. 23 Squadron flew its SPADs both on offensive fighter patrols over the front and low-level strafing attacks against German troops. In December 1917 it replaced its SPAD S.VII with the more powerful and heavier armed Spad S.XIII. The squadron converted to Sopwith Dolphins in April 1918 until it disbanded just after the war on 31 December 1919. It numbered 19 aces among its ranks during the war, including: 
William Kennedy-Cochran-Patrick; 
Douglas U. McGregor;
James Pearson;
Clive W. Warman; 
Frederick Gibbs; 
Conn Standish O&#x27;Grady; 
Herbert Drewitt; 
James Fitz-Morris; 
Harold Albert White; 
Alfred Edwin McKay; 
Harry Compton; and
Arthur Bradfield Fairclough, MC.

===Reformation===

The squadron was re-formed on 1 July 1925 at RAF Henlow with the Sopwith Snipe, under command of the First World War air ace Raymond Collishaw. The squadron re-equipped with more modern Gloster Gamecock fighters in May 1926, and moved to RAF Kenley in February 1927.

In April 1931 the squadron partly re-equipped with Bristol Bulldogs, another single seat fighter, while continuing to operate the Gamecock. Both the Gamecock and Bulldog were outperformed by the Hawker Hart light bomber which had recently entered service with the RAF, and in June 1931, the squadron received a single Hart for evaluation as a two seat fighter. The evaluation was a success, and a flight of six fighter variants of the Hart, designated the Hart Fighter replaced the squadrons remaining Gamecocks from October that year. The squadron moved to RAF Biggin Hill in September 1932 and by April 1933, was fully equipped with Hart fighters, which by then were known as Hawker Demons.

The Abyssinia Crisis in September 1935 led to the squadron being stripped of both aircraft and men in order to reinforce squadrons that were temporarily deployed overseas, with the squadron inventory dropping to a single aircraft in March 1936 before returning to full strength. It moved to RAF Northolt in December 1936, moving again in May 1938, this time to RAF Wittering. In December 1938 the squadron replaced its obsolete Demon biplanes with the Bristol Blenheim twin-engine monoplane, another bomber converted to a fighter.

===Second World War===

On the outbreak of the Second World War the squadron, still equipped with Blenheims, became a night-fighter squadron. The squadron scored its first victory of the war on 18 June 1940, when a German Heinkel He 111 was shot down over Cley next the Sea, Norfolk, with another He 111 being shot down the same night, although two Blenheims were lost to return fire from German bombers. As the Blenheim was too slow and lightly armed to be an effective night fighter, the squadron began to operate in the night intruder role in December 1940, attacking German bombers as they returned to their airfields in France. From March 1941 the squadron replaced its Blenheims with the American Douglas Havoc, which were supplemented by the Boston III variant of the Havoc in February 1942.

In July 1942 the squadron re-equipped with the more capable de Havilland Mosquito. In December 1942 the squadron transferred to the Mediterranean, flying from RAF Luqa on Malta. It attacked enemy airfields and railway targets in Sicily, Tunisia and Italy through 1943, moving to Sardinia in December 1943, which allowed targets in Southern France to be attacked. In June 1944 the squadron returned to England, operating from RAF Little Snoring in Norfolk as part of 100 Group. The role of 100 Group was bomber support, i.e. to disrupt the Luftwaffe&#x27;s attempts to stop the British bomber offensive, with 23 Squadron being tasked with low level night intruder operations against German night fighters. In addition to its normal night time operations, the squadron also carried out daylight bomber escort missions. 23 Sqn was disbanded, following the war&#x27;s end, on 25 September 1945.

===Postwar operations===
The squadron was reformed on 1 September 1946 as a night fighter squadron operating the de Havilland Mosquito. It received jet aircraft in the form of de Havilland Vampire NF.10s in 1953, replacing them with de Havilland Venom NF.2s in June 1954. The squadron acquired Venom NF.3 in 1957.


In 1957 the squadron converted to the Gloster Javelin all-weather fighter, beginning a long period operating in the air defence role. The squadron has a strong heritage in the air defence role, operating Gloster Javelins, Lightnings, Phantoms and Tornado F3s. The squadron first acquired Phantoms on 1 November 1975 at RAF Coningsby before moving to RAF Wattisham for just under 10 years. Then in October 1983 the squadron deployed to Port Stanley Airport, Falkland Islands after their recapture from Argentina, arriving there on 1 November. They remained here until 31 October 1988 when its duty was assumed by 1435 Flight. The squadron then reformed on 1 November 1988 at RAF Leeming with the Panavia Tornado which it operated until 26 February 1994, when the unit was disbanded.

The squadron assumed the Airborne Early Warning role upon reformation in April 1996, sharing the RAF&#x27;s Sentry AEW1 fleet with No. 8 Squadron. Flying a majority of control and surveillance sorties over the Balkans, the unit received a battle honour for its direct support during the Kosovo campaign. The squadron disbanded on 2 October 2009, when it amalgamated with No 8 Squadron.

===Future===

At the Air &amp; Space Power Conference on 17 July 2019 it was announced that the squadron would reform as the RAF&#x27;s first dedicated squadron to deal with space. And in early January 2021, the squadron was reformed as a &#x27;space squadron&#x27;, which will be &quot;responsible for day-to-day space command-and-control&quot;.

==Notable squadron members==
Douglas Bader was a member of 23 Squadron when he crashed carrying out low level aerobatics, losing his legs in the process. He went on to become one of the highest scoring aces of the RAF in World War II. Air Officer Commanding Sir Peter Wykeham was credited with shooting down at least 15 hostile aircraft at various theatres of World War II. He was later promoted to Air Marshal. He served as Officer Commanding No. 38 Group from 1960, the Director of the Joint Warfare Staff from 1962, the Commander of the Far East Air Force from 1964 and the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff from 1967 before retiring in 1969. Andrew George Walton flew with the squadron in Tornados and Phantoms, and rose to the rank of Air Vice Marshal, receiving a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) in the process, before retiring in 2010.

Wing Commander Alan &#x27;Red&#x27; Owen DFC and Bar, AFC, DFM, was 23 Squadron&#x27;s commanding officer between May 1962 and October 1964. He was one of the RAFs most successful night fighter pilots during World War II, credited with destroying at least 15 enemy aircraft.

Air Commodore Charles Kingsford Smith MC, Australian Aviation pioneer was assigned to the Squadron in July 1917, while in the Squadron he shot down four German fighters before being shot down himself, he would go on to hold a training role within the Squadron.

<text>On the Town is a musical with music by Leonard Bernstein and book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, based on Jerome Robbins&#x27; idea for his 1944 ballet &quot;Fancy Free&quot;, which he had set to Bernstein&#x27;s music. The musical introduced several popular and classic songs, among them &quot;New York, New York&quot;, &quot;Lonely Town&quot;, &quot;I Can Cook, Too&quot; (for which Bernstein also wrote the lyric), and &quot;Some Other Time&quot;. The story concerns three American sailors on a 24-hour shore leave in New York City in 1944, during World War II. Each of the three sailors meets and quickly connects with a woman.

&quot;On the Town&quot; was first produced on Broadway in 1944 and was made into a film in 1949, although the film replaced all but four of the original Broadway numbers with Hollywood-written substitutes. The show has enjoyed several major revivals. The musical integrates dance into its storytelling: Robbins made several ballets and extended dance sequences for the show, including the &quot;Imaginary Coney Island&quot; ballet.

==Background==
The Jerome Robbins ballet &quot;Fancy-Free&quot; (1944), with music by Leonard Bernstein, was a hit for the American Ballet Theatre, and Oliver Smith, who designed the sets; his business partner, Paul Feigay, thought that the ballet could be turned into a Broadway musical. They convinced Robbins and Bernstein, who in turn wanted their friends Comden and Green to write the book and lyrics. When the director George Abbott was added to the project, funding was secured, including funding from the movie studio MGM in return for the film rights.

== Productions ==
; Broadway
&quot;On the Town&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Adelphi Theater on December 28, 1944, directed by George Abbott and with choreography by Jerome Robbins. It closed on February 2, 1946, after 462 performances. The production starred John Battles (Gabey, who replaced Kirk Douglas before tryouts), Cris Alexander (Chip), Nancy Walker (Hildy), Sono Osato (Ivy), Betty Comden (Claire), and Adolph Green (Ozzie). The musical director was Max Goberman. The original production of &quot;On the Town&quot; was notable for its racially diverse cast and intentional avoidance of racial stereotypes. The Japanese-American dancer Sono Osato starred as Ivy; there were six African-Americans in the cast, who were treated as part of the citizenry; and nine months into the run, the black conductor Everett Lee took over the podium.

The first Broadway revival opened at the Imperial Theatre on October 31, 1971, and closed on Jan 1, 1972, after 73 performances. Donna McKechnie, Phyllis Newman, and Bernadette Peters co-starred as Ivy, Claire, and Hildy. The director and choreographer were Ron Field. Peters received a nomination for the 1972 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical. In his review for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Clive Barnes wrote:
The second Broadway revival opened at the Gershwin Theatre on November 19, 1998, and ran for 69 performances. This production began as a summer event at the Public Theater&#x27;s Delacorte Theater in Central Park and made use of the venue in unique ways. Upon its Broadway Transfer, critics disparaged the subsequent production and changes as lifeless and bland by comparison. Lea Delaria&#x27;s performance as Hildy the taxi driver (and especially her all-stops-out rendition of &quot;I Can Cook, Too&quot;) won wide praise, with Ben Brantley writing &quot;Working through the saucy double-entendres and scat embellishments of &quot;I Can Cook Too,&quot; Hildy&#x27;s mating call of a solo, Ms. DeLaria makes an obliging captive of anyone watching her.&quot; Mary Testa was nominated for the 1999 Tony Award as Best Featured Actress in a Musical; Lea Delaria was nominated for the Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical and won the Theatre World Award.

A Broadway revival opened at the Lyric Theatre on September 20, 2014, in previews, and officially on October 16, directed by John Rando with choreography by Joshua Bergasse. The cast featured Jay Armstrong Johnson (Chip), Tony Yazbeck (Gabey) and Clyde Alves (Ozzie), and Megan Fairchild (Ivy), Alysha Umphress (Hildy), and Elizabeth Stanley (Claire) as the three women in the sailors&#x27; lives, as well as Jackie Hoffman (Madame Dilly), Michael Rupert (Judge Pitkin), and Allison Guinn (Lucy Schmeeler). A cast album was recorded at Audio Paint Studios in New York City in 2014. The production closed, after 28 previews and 368 regular performances, on September 6, 2015.

; Other US

An Encores! staged concert was presented at New York City Center from November 19, 2008, through November 23, 2008, as part of a citywide celebration of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 90th birthday. John Rando was the director, Warren Carlyle the choreographer, with a cast that featured Justin Bohon (Chip), Christian Borle (Ozzie), Tony Yazbeck (Gabey), Jessica Lee Goldyn (Ivy), Leslie Kritzer (Hildy Esterhazy), Jennifer Laura Thompson (Claire De Loone), and Andrea Martin (Madame P. Dilly).

In reviewing this production, Charles Isherwood wrote: &quot;The production is rich in dance ... and winning performances (particularly from Tony Yazbeck as the lovelorn sailor Gabey, and a scenery-devouring Andrea Martin as a nutso-dipso voice teacher), but it&#x27;s richest of all in music. There are several ballet sequences, instant reprises, jazzy pop songs, classical spoofs, and soaring ballads.&quot;

A production of &quot;On The Town&quot; opened in June 2013 at Barrington Stage Company in Massachusetts. John Rando directed the production and Joshua Bergasse choreographed. The production starred Tony Yazbeck (Gabey), Clyde Alves (Ozzie), Jay Armstrong Johnson (Chip), Alysha Umphress (Hildy), Deanna Doyle (Ivy), Elizabeth Stanley (Claire), Michael Rupert (Judge Pitkin), Allison Guinn (Lucy Schmeeler), and Nancy Opel (Madame P. Dilly). In his review Ben Brantley wrote: &quot;John Rando&#x27;s production of &quot;On The Town,&quot; the 1944 musical about three sailors on shore leave in New York City, is one of those rare revivals that remind us what a hit show from long was originally all about. The joy of Mr. Rando&#x27;s production is in its air of erotic effortlessness.&quot;

; London
The first London production of &quot;On the Town&quot; opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre on May 30, 1963, and ran for 63 performances. It was directed and choreographed by Joe Layton and starred Elliott Gould and Don McKay. The main female roles were taken by two Americans, Carol Arthur and Andrea Jaffe, and an English actress, Gillian Lewis. It was not a propitious time for new musicals in London, given dramatic developments that year in British popular music. A month earlier, Bock and Harnick&#x27;s &quot;She Loves Me&quot; had opened on Broadway and ran for some 300 performances, but flopped when it came to London in 1964, not least because people thought the title had something to do with the Beatles.

In 1992, Michael Tilson Thomas led the London Symphony Orchestra and an all-star, crossover cast of opera and theater performers in a semi-staged concert version produced by Deutsche Grammophon and recorded for both CD and video release. The video was also aired on the PBS series &quot;Great Performances&quot;, and in the UK on both BBC Two and BBC Radio 3 in January 1994. Participants included Frederica von Stade, Thomas Hampson, Tyne Daly, Cleo Laine, David Garrison, Samuel Ramey, and, as both narrators and performers, Comden and Green themselves. The resulting recordings included material cut at various stages of the musical&#x27;s development. Thomas revived this concert edition of the work in 1996 with the San Francisco Symphony, with many of the same performers.

&quot;On The Town&quot; was part of English National Opera&#x27;s repertoire, running April 20 – May 25, 2007, at the London Coliseum, with Caroline O&#x27;Connor as Hildy, with choreography by Stephen Mear.

As part of their 2017 Season, the Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre staged &quot;On The Town&quot;, directed and choreographed by Drew McOnie; it is billed as the biggest dance musical ever staged at the theatre.

A semi-staged concert version was performed at the Royal Albert Hall, London, as part of the 2018 Proms, on 25 August, the exact centenary of Bernstein&#x27;s birth. The London Symphony Orchestra was conducted by John Wilson.

==1949 film version==
The MGM film opened on December 8, 1949. It starred Gene Kelly as Gabey (who also co-directed with Stanley Donen), Frank Sinatra as Chip, and Jules Munshin as Ozzie, as well as Ann Miller (Claire), Vera-Ellen (Ivy) and Betty Garrett (Hildy). The film dispensed with many of the Bernstein songs, keeping four, including &quot;New York, New York,&quot; and replaced the others with new songs with music by Roger Edens and lyrics by Comden and Green.

==Plot summary==
; Act I
A trio of dockyard workers mourns the start of a new workday (&quot;I Feel Like I&#x27;m Not Out of Bed Yet&quot;). The whistle blows at 6 AM, and three sailors emerge: Ozzie, Chip, and Gabey, excited for 24 hours of shore leave (&quot;New York, New York&quot;). Chip is excited to see all the sights that his father told him about after his trip to New York in 1934, with his decade-old guidebook by his side. Ozzie is interested in finding a date (or several) because Manhattan women are the prettiest in the world. Gabey is looking for one special girl, hopefully, one who reminds him of his 7th-grade girlfriend, Minnie Finchley. On the subway, the three spot a poster of Ivy Smith, &quot;Miss Turnstiles&quot; for June. Gabey, overcome with love for the picture, takes it with him. An old lady angrily tells him that she will have him arrested for vandalism and the three run off.

Gabey wants to meet Ivy Smith, despite Chip&#x27;s protests that the city is too big for things like that to happen. Ozzie, recounting an incident where Gabey saved their lives, convinces Chip to help Gabey find her. Chip grudgingly agrees and Ozzie coaches Gabey on what to do once he meets Ivy (&quot;Gabey&#x27;s Comin&#x27;,&quot; performed in the 2014 Broadway revival). The three break up, Gabey to Carnegie Hall, Ozzie to the Museum of Modern Art, and Chip to the &quot;subway people.&quot; The three imagine what Miss Turnstiles must be like, and a ballet is performed in which Ivy demonstrates all the many different, contradictory, skills she has.

The little old lady finds a policeman and the two chase after the sailors.

A young female cabbie named Hildy is found asleep in her cab by her irate boss S. Uperman. He fires her and tells her to return the cab in an hour or he will call the police. Looking for one last fare, she comes across Chip. It is love at first sight, at least for Hildy. She forcefully kisses Chip, but Chip wants nothing more than to find Ivy. Hildy tempts him into taking a tour of the city, but all the places he wants to go (the Hippodrome, the Forrest Theatre to see &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;, the New York City Aquarium, and the Woolworth Building) are either no longer in existence or no longer notable. The only place Hildy wants to take Chip is her apartment (&quot;Come Up to My Place&quot;). Uperman joins the lady and the cop in the chase, implying Hildy stole the cab.

Ozzie goes to the museum but mistakenly arrives at the Museum of Natural History instead of the Museum of Modern Art. There he meets a budding anthropologist, Claire de Loone. She is amazed at his resemblance to a prehistoric man and asks him for his measurements. He mistakes her scientific interest for romantic interest, but as she explains, she is engaged to be married to the famous Judge Pitkin W. Bridgework. Pitkin has taught her to learn to know men scientifically, but she, like Ozzie, often gets &quot;Carried Away.&quot; The two of them accidentally knock over a dinosaur. Waldo Figment, the professor who built the dinosaur, joins Uperman, the cop, and the lady in the chase.

Gabey mopes around the city. Without love, New York is nothing but a &quot;Lonely Town.&quot;

At Carnegie Hall, Ivy Smith is taking lessons from Madame Dilly, a drunk who clearly does not know vocal training. Ivy is not quite as glamorous as the Miss Turnstiles contest has made her out to be. In reality, while she is studying to do all the things they said she was, she is nothing more than a &quot;cooch dancer&quot; at Coney Island. When Madame Dilly leaves to refill her flask, Gabey enters. He asks Ivy to go out with him, and to his surprise, she accepts. Gabey leaves ecstatically. Madame Dilly advises Ivy to break the date as &quot;sex and art don&#x27;t mix&quot; (&quot;Carnegie Hall Pavane&quot;)

Ozzie accompanies Claire back to her apartment, where he meets Claire&#x27;s fiancé, Pitkin W. Bridgework. They try desperately to explain what they are doing together, but Pitkin does not mind (&quot;I Understand&quot;). He leaves them alone to go to a meeting, reminding Claire that they are to meet at Diamond Eddie&#x27;s to celebrate their engagement. The two take advantage of their alone time (&quot;Carried Away (reprise)&quot;).

Hildy brings Chip and an armful of groceries back to her apartment, promising to cook for him. Chip insists that he must leave to find Ivy. She tells him to call the IRT, but they refuse to give Chip her address or phone number. He decides that he has tried hard enough, and he and Hildy attempt to get physical when her roommate, Lucy Schmeeler, home from work with a cold, intrudes. Hildy finally gets rid of her by convincing her to go to an air-cooled movie. Hildy seduces Chip, bragging about her many talents, not the least of which is her cooking (&quot;I Can Cook Too&quot;).

Gabey&#x27;s attitude has done a full 180, and he feels &quot;Lucky to Be Me.&quot; Ivy, about to meet Gabey at Nedick&#x27;s, runs into Madame Dilly, who reminds her that if she does not do her cooch dance that night, she will be fired, and will not be able to pay Madame Dilly for her lessons. Madame Dilly threatens to smear her reputation, and she is forced to stand Gabey up.

Chip and Ozzie both arrive at Nedick&#x27;s with Hildy and Claire, both dressed as Ivy Smith. Gabey is not fooled and tells them the story of how he met her. Just then, Madame Dilly arrives with a message from Ivy: she will not be coming because she instead elected to go to a fancy party. Gabey is alone and dejected, but Hildy tells him that she can get him a date: Lucy. The five go into a dance demonstrating the nightlife of the city.

; Act II

At Diamond Eddie&#x27;s, the dancers perform a number (&quot;So Long Baby&quot;). Gabey is still hung up on Miss Turnstiles, and Lucy has not shown up yet. A singer, Diana Dream, performs a very sad song, &quot;I Wish I Was Dead,&quot; which causes Gabey to feel even sadder. Lucy calls, having accidentally gone to the Diamond Eddie&#x27;s in Yonkers. The group decides to go to the Congacabana at the suggestion of Claire, but on their way out, they run into Pitkin. Ozzie and Claire try to explain the situation, but as before, all Pitkin says is &quot;I Understand (reprise).&quot; The gang leaves for the Congacabana while Pitkin stays behind to pay the check.

At the Congacabana, Dolores Dolores (the same performer as &quot;Diana Dream&quot;) sings the same sad song as before, in Spanish. Hildy interrupts her, saying she had gotten a request to sing. Hildy, as well as Ozzie, Claire, and Chip try to lift Gabey&#x27;s spirits by reminding him that he can count on them (&quot;Ya Got Me&quot;). As they are about to depart for another nightclub, the Slam Bang Club, Pitkin arrives (&quot;I Understand (reprise)&quot;). Claire tells him once again to pay the check, also to wait for Lucy and come to the Slam Bang later.

At the Slam Bang Club, Madame Dilly is in a drunken stupor. Gabey asks her where Ivy is, and she lets it slip that she is at Coney Island. Gabey runs off to find her. Chip and Ozzie, afraid that he will not be able to get back to the ship on time, rush after him. On their way out, they come across Lucy and Pitkin. Claire once again leaves him to go with Ozzie. Pitkin recalls all the times in his life that he &quot;understood&quot; and realizes he has been played the fool by everyone, including Claire (&quot;Pitkin&#x27;s Song (I Understand)&quot;). He also bonds with Lucy and the two of them join the chase along with the little old lady, the police officers, Figment, and Uperman.

Riding the subway, Gabey dreams about Coney Island and Ivy. An extended dance sequence occurs with Ivy and a dream Gabey in a boxing match (&quot;Subway Ride/The Great Lover Displays Himself/The Imaginary Coney Island&quot;).

The other four have just missed Gabey and are riding another subway car. They wonder about their future after the men have to go back to the ship (&quot;Some Other Time&quot;).

At Coney Island, Ivy, along with several other girls, dances in a show called Rajah Bimmy&#x27;s Harem Scarem (&quot;The Real Coney Island&quot;). Gabey sees Ivy and accidentally tears her already skimpy outfit off. She is arrested for indecent exposure as the chasers arrive and demand the others be arrested. Claire hopes Pitkin will get her out of the situation, but he no longer trusts her and has the three men brought to the naval authorities. The girls ask Pitkin if he has ever &quot;committed an indiscretion,&quot; which he staunchly refuses. Just then, he sneezes in the same way as Lucy Schmeeler, casting doubt on his claim.

As the clock chimes six, the sailors prepare to get back on the ship. Just then, the girls come running to them, telling them that Pitkin understood. They say a fond farewell as three new sailors leave the ship, eager to have their own adventures in New York City (&quot;New York, New York (reprise)/Finale Act II&quot;).

<text>Darfur ( ; ) is a region of western Sudan. &quot;Dār&quot; is an Arabic word meaning &quot;home [of]&quot; – the region was named Dardaju () while ruled by the Daju, who migrated from Meroë , and it was renamed Dartunjur () when the Tunjur ruled the area. Darfur was an independent sultanate for several hundred years until 1874, when it fell to the Sudanese warlord Rabih az-Zubayr. The region was later invaded and incorporated into Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1916.

As an administrative region, Darfur is divided into five federal states: Central Darfur, East Darfur, North Darfur, South Darfur and West Darfur. Because of the War in Darfur between Sudanese government forces and the indigenous population, the region has been in a state of humanitarian emergency and genocide since 2003. The factors include religious and ethnic rivalry, and the rivalry between farmers and herders.

==Geography==


Darfur covers an area of , approximately the size of mainland Spain. It is largely a semi-desert plateau with the Marrah Mountains ( Marra), a range of volcanic peaks rising up to of elevation above sea level, and a topographic prominence of 2512 m, in the center of the region. The region&#x27;s main towns are Al Fashir, Geneina, and Nyala.

There are four main features of its physical geography. The whole eastern half of Darfur is covered with plains and low hills of sandy soils, known as &quot;&quot;, and sandstone hills. In many places the &quot;goz&quot; is waterless and can only be inhabited where there are water reservoirs or deep boreholes. While dry, &quot;goz&quot; may also support rich pasture and arable land. To the north the &quot;goz&quot; is overtaken by the desert sands of the Sahara. A second feature are the &quot;wadis&quot;, which range from seasonal watercourses that flood only occasionally during the wet season to large &quot;wadis&quot; that flood for most of the rains and flow from western Darfur hundreds of kilometres west to Lake Chad. Many &quot;wadis&quot; have pans of alluvium with rich heavy soil that are also difficult to cultivate. Western Darfur is dominated by the third feature, basement rock, sometimes covered with a thin layer of sandy soil. Basement rock is too infertile to be farmed, but provides sporadic forest cover that can be grazed by animals. The fourth and final feature are the Marrah Mountains and Daju Hills, volcanic plugs created by a massif, that rise up to a peak at Deriba crater where there is a small area of temperate climate, high rainfall and permanent springs of water.

Remote sensing has detected the imprint of a vast underground lake under Darfur. The potential water deposits are estimated at . The lake, during epochs when the region was more humid, would have contained about of water. It may have dried up thousands of years ago.

==History==

The first historical mention of the word &quot;Fur&quot; occurs in 1664 in the account by J. M. Vansleb, a German traveler, of a visit to Egypt. It is claimed that, like &quot;sūdān&quot;, &quot;fūr&quot; means &quot;blacks&quot;, and was the name given by the early light-colored Berber sultans of Darfur to the original inhabitants of the country such as the Binga, Banda, etc. As the historic dynasty&#x27;s physical appearance became more &quot;Africanized&quot; from intermarriage with black wives and concubines, the appearance of the sultans darkened correspondingly and they became known by the appellation of their subjects, &quot;Fūr&quot;. Most of the region consists of a semi-arid plain and thus appears unsuitable for developing a large and complex civilization. But the Marrah Mountains offer plentiful water, and by the 12th century the Daju people, succeeding the semi-legendary Tora culture, created the first historical attestable kingdom. They were centered in the Marrah Mountains and left records of valuable rock engravings, stone architecture and a (orally preserved) list of kings. The Tunjur replaced the Daju in the fourteenth century and the Daju established new headquarters in Abyei, Denga, Darsila and Mongo in the current Chad. The Tunjur sultans intermarried with the Fur and sultan Musa Sulayman (reigned ) is considered the founder of the Keira dynasty. Darfur became a great power of the Sahel under the Keira dynasty, expanding its borders as far east as the Atbarah River and attracting immigrants from Bornu and Bagirmi. During the mid-18th century conflict between rival factions wracked the country, and external war pitted Darfur against Sennar and Wadai. In 1875, the weakened kingdom was destroyed by the Egyptian ruler set up in Khartoum, largely through the machinations of Sebehr Rahma, a slave-trader, who was competing with the dar over access to ivory in Bahr el Ghazal to the south of Darfur.

The Darfuris were restive under Egyptian rule, but were no more predisposed to accept the rule of the self-proclaimed Mahdi, Muhammad Ahmad, when in 1882 his Emir of Darfur, who came from the Southern Darfur Arab Rizeigat tribe led by Sheikh Madibbo, defeated the Ottoman forces led by Slatin Pasha (that had just invaded Egypt earlier that year) in Darfur. When Ahmad&#x27;s successor, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad, himself an Arab of Southern Darfur from the Ta’isha tribe, demanded that the pastoralist tribes provide soldiers, several tribes rose up in revolt. Following the defeat of Abdallahi at Omdurman in 1899 by an Anglo-Egyptian expeditionary force, the new Anglo-Egyptian government recognized Ali Dinar as the sultan of Darfur and largely left the Dar to its own affairs except for a nominal annual tribute.

In 1916, after the British government suspected that the sultan was falling under the influence of the Ottoman government, an expedition was launched from Egypt to capture and annex Darfur into the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The colonial government directed financial and administrative resources to the tribes of central Sudan near Khartoum - while the outlying regions such as Darfur remained mostly forgotten and ignored. K. D. D. Henderson was the last British governor of Darfur.

=== Under Sudanese rule===

A pattern of skewed economic development continued after Sudan achieved political independence in 1956. The governor at the time of independence was Ali Abdallah Abu Sinn, who had joined the civil service in 1923 and served in Darfur since 1946. In August 1958 he was succeeded by Ahmad Makki Abdo, who remained in power despite the coup d&#x27;état of that year, until he was finally dismissed in December 1959 and replaced by al-Tijani Sa&#x27;d. The proxy wars between Sudan, Libya and Chad added an element of political instability. Darfurians began to respond to the ideology of Arab supremacy propagated by Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi (in power 1969–2011). A famine in the mid-1980s disrupted many societal structures and led to the first significant modern fighting amongst Darfuris. A low-level conflict continued for the next fifteen years, with the government co-opting and arming Arab Janjaweed militias against its enemies. The fighting reached a peak in 2003 with the beginning of the Darfur conflict, in which the resistance coalesced into a roughly cohesive rebel movement. In March 2004, human-rights groups and the UN came to regard the conflict as one of the worst humanitarian disasters in the world. Insurgency and counter-insurgency have led to 480,000 deaths (the Khartoum government disputes the numbers). This has been labeled as the Darfur genocide. &quot;By 2010 about 300,000 had died, according to the UN best estimate, and about 3,000,000 were forced into refugee camps.&quot; Over 2.8 million people have become displaced since 2003, many of whom were children (see Lost Boys of Sudan). Many of these refugees have gone into camps where emergency aid has created conditions that, although extremely basic, are better than in the villages, which offer no protection against the various militias that operate in the region.

Nearly two-thirds of the population continues to struggle to survive in remote villages. Virtually no foreigners visit the region because of the fear of kidnapping, and only some non-governmental organizations continue to provide long-term grass-roots assistance. the United Nations is in discussion with the Government of Sudan over the withdrawal of UNAMID, the peacekeeping force, which is the largest in the world. Other UN agencies (such as the WFP) might exit.

During the existence of the Calais Jungle refugee camp, Darfur was listed as a major source of the camp&#x27;s inhabitants.

===Peace process===

====Darfur Peace Agreement (also known as Abuja Agreement)====

The Government of Sudan and the Sudan Liberation Movement of Minni Minnawi signed a Darfur Peace Agreement in 2006. Only one rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement, subscribed to the agreement; the Justice and Equality Movement rejected it, resulting in a continuation of the conflict. The agreement includes provisions for wealth-sharing and power-sharing and established a Transitional Darfur Regional Authority to help administer Darfur until a referendum could take place on the future of the region. The leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement, Minni Minnawi, was appointed Senior Assistant to the President of Sudan and Chairman of the transitional authority in 2007.

====Doha Agreement====
In December 2010, representatives of the Liberation and Justice Movement, an umbrella organisation of ten rebel groups, formed in February of that year, started a fresh round of talks with the Sudanese Government in Doha, Qatar. A new rebel group, the Sudanese Alliance Resistance Forces in Darfur, was formed and the Justice and Equality Movement planned further talks. The talks ended on December 19 without a new peace agreement, but participants agreed on basic principles, including a regional authority and a referendum on autonomy for Darfur. The possibility of a Darfuri Vice-President was also discussed.

In January 2011, the leader of the Liberation and Justice Movement, Dr. Tijani Sese, stated that the movement had accepted the core proposals of the Darfur peace document proposed by the joint-mediators in Doha; the proposals included a $300,000,000 compensation package for victims of atrocities in Darfur and special courts to conduct trials of persons accused of human-rights violations. Proposals for a new Darfur Regional Authority were also included; this authority would have an executive council of 18 ministers and would remain in place for five years. The current three Darfur states and state governments would also continue to exist during this period. In February 2011 the Sudanese Government rejected the idea of a single region headed by a vice-president from the region.

On 29 January, the leaders of the Liberation and Justice Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to the Doha negotiations and agreement to attend the Doha forum on 5 February. The Sudanese government had not yet agreed to attend the forum on that date and instead favoured an internal peace process without the involvement of rebel groups. Later in February, the Sudanese Government agreed to return to the Doha peace forum with a view to complete a new peace agreement by the end of that month. On 25 February, both the Liberation and Justice Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement announced that they had rejected the peace document proposed by the mediators in Doha. The main sticking points were the issues of a Darfuri vice-president and compensation for victims. The Sudanese government had not commented on the peace document.

At the Doha Peace Forum in June, the Joint Mediators proposed a new Darfur Peace Agreement, which would supersede the Abuja Agreement of 2005 and if signed, would halt preparations for a Darfur status referendum. The proposal included provisions for a Darfuri Vice-President and an administrative structure that includes both the three states and a strategic regional authority, the Darfur Regional Authority, to oversee Darfur as a whole. The new agreement was signed by the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement on 14 July. The Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement did not sign the new document at that time but had three months in which to do so if they wished.

====2020 peace agreement (Juba Agreement)====

A comprehensive peace agreement was signed on 31 August 2020 in Juba, South Sudan, between the Sudanese authorities and rebel factions to end armed hostilities.

However, further tribal clashes have continued during 2021.

==== Sudanese Civil War (2023-Present) ====
During the Sudanese Civil War, there have been considerable fighting in the Darfur region. This includes the Masalit Massacres perpetuated by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), causing some analysts to declare a genocide in Sudan.

==Languages==
Languages of Darfur include Daju, Erenga (or Sungor), Fongoro, Fulbe (or Fulfulde), Fur (thus the name of the region), Masalit, Sinyar, Tama, Midob, and Zaghawa.

==Government==

The region is divided into five federal states: Central Darfur, East Darfur, North Darfur, South Darfur and West Darfur. The Darfur Peace Agreement of 2006 established a Transitional Darfur Regional Authority as an interim authority for the region. The agreement stated that a referendum on the status of Darfur should be held no later than 2011. Minni Minnawi was the first chair of this authority, holding that office from April 2007 until December 2010, when he was succeeded by Shartai Jaafar Abdel Hakam. The peace agreement that was signed in July 2011 saw the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority reconstituted as the Darfur Regional Authority with executive and legislative functions. The chairperson of the Darfur Regional Authority, Tijani Sese, assumed the post on 20 September 2011. The regional authority was dissolved in July 2016 following a referendum, on the status of the Darfur region within Sudan. As part of the Sudanese transition to democracy, a Darfur Regional Government was created in August 2021 with Minni Minawi as Regional Governor.

==Demographics and economy==
In 2008, Darfur&#x27;s population was 7.5 million. This in an increase by nearly six times from 1973 (1.3 million). 52% are aged 16 years or younger.

Darfur&#x27;s budget was US$286 million in 2008.

<text>Top of the Pops 2 (also known as TOTP2) is a British television music show broadcast on BBC Two showing archive footage from the long-running &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; show, some dating back to the 1960s when the programme first aired on British television, as well as other surviving BBC programmes.

==Format==
The original format of the show consisted of various segments including &quot;recorded for recall&quot;, which would show &quot;TOTP&quot; performances from a certain decade, &quot;video stir&quot; which featured a new music video from a popular artist in the charts, the &quot;first time&quot; would feature an artist&#x27;s first &quot;TOTP&quot; appearance, &quot;world hits&quot; would feature a new international hit, &quot;tomorrows hits&quot; would feature artists who were predicted to enter the UK Top 40 the following week, and then &quot;the original&quot; would feature numerous performances from that week&#x27;s edition of &quot;TOTP&quot;. The &#x27;Top 10&#x27; singles chart and the number one single of the week would also be shown. This format existed until 1997, when the show format changed to only feature performances from the &quot;TOTP&quot; archive, mixed with the occasional exclusive new performance for &quot;TOTP2&quot;.

From its debut in 1994, the show was narrated by Johnnie Walker. Steve Wright took over narrator duties in 1997 until December 2009, when Mark Radcliffe took over presenter duties until the show&#x27;s cancellation in 2017. To date, the presenter has never appeared in-vision, but provides voice-over commentary that introduces each performance.

For a period of time, the BBC ran a daily version of &quot;TOTP2&quot; in which celebrities chose their favourite archive performances. These celebrities, typically comedians, have included Vic Reeves &amp; Bob Mortimer, Phill Jupitus and Jack Dee. There have also been a number of &quot;TOTP2&quot; specials, where a &quot;greatest hits&quot; show dedicated to one musician or band has aired. Examples include the Bee Gees, Elvis Presley, Shania Twain and Dionne Warwick specials which aired between 1997–2003.

Since its debut, &quot;TOTP2&quot; has also broadcast regular specials for certain theme nights or calendar events. Examples include Christmas and New Years Eve specials.

===Hiatus===
In 2004, the controller of BBC Two, Roly Keating, announced that the programme was to be &quot;rested&quot;. After the 4 June 2004 episode, the channel&#x27;s only subsequent &quot;TOTP2&quot; broadcasts for two years were Christmas specials on 24 December 2004 and 24 December 2005.

The hiatus preceded a format change for the main &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; programme, which was moved from its BBC One Friday-night primetime slot to a new slot on Sunday nights on BBC Two in 2005. &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;&#x27; new format merged its usual format of new chart performances with the &quot;TOTP2&quot; format of archival recordings.

This &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; format ran until the show was cancelled in July 2006.

===After &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;===
After the cancellation of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;TOTP2&quot; returned to BBC Two on 30 September 2006. The new show format was similar to the earlier &quot;TOTP2&quot;, but also included live/original BBC performances. These episodes were produced and broadcast in the 4:3 aspect ratio like the majority of its archive material, except for the first two episodes, which were shown in the 16:9 aspect ratio to accommodate new performances. The first 50-minute special included Nelly Furtado, Jamelia and Razorlight, before it reverted to a 30-minute weekly format at 20:00.

The BBC planned to replace the main &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; special on Christmas Day 2008 with a special edition of &quot;TOTP2&quot;, that would have included some live performances and archive footage as well as the 2008 Christmas number one UK single; these plans were later scrapped due to complaints by viewers. This led to Simon Cowell asking the BBC to buy the rights to the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; brand so he could produce a version of it for ITV1. The BBC later refused Cowell&#x27;s offer and announced that they would show &quot;TOTP&quot; on Christmas Day on BBC One as well as the &quot;TOTP2&quot; specials on BBC Two.

===Final episodes===
Since 2008, new sporadic &quot;TOTP2&quot; specials have aired, most notably Christmas specials, alongside repeats of episodes originally broadcast between 1997 and 2012.

On 27 June 2009, &quot;TOTP2&quot; returned unexpectedly to celebrate the life of Michael Jackson, who had died two days earlier. This later turned out to be the last episode to be narrated by Steve Wright.

In December 2009, Mark Radcliffe took over as presenter of &quot;TOTP2&quot;. On 10 May 2010, a &quot;TOTP2&quot; 80s Special aired on BBC Two. This marked the 500th edition of &quot;TOTP2&quot;.

December 2013 saw the introduction of a new &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; logo, and a presentation refresh for &quot;TOTP2&quot;. It also saw the return of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; as the shows theme tune, this variant being a mix of the original and the 1998 remix version.

In recent years, BBC Four has aired vintage editions of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; – originally 35 years to the week of the original broadcast, starting with 1976 repeats shown in 2011 – with the renewed interest in the original shows earning ratings of up to a million viewers, prompting the channel to repeat editions of &quot;TOTP2&quot;, such as in the aftermath of the Christmas Day 2016 death of George Michael. In addition, various performances from &quot;TOTP&quot; and other programmes have been repackaged as music specials by the &quot;TOTP2&quot; team, such as &quot;Disco at the BBC&quot;, &quot;Country at the BBC&quot; and &quot;Abba at the BBC&quot;. Music documentaries fronted by the likes of Nile Rodgers and Gregory Porter have also featured alongside, under the slogan &quot;Friday night is Music Night&quot;.

In tandem with their launch of whole-episode &quot;TOTP&quot; reruns, BBC Four launched a new clip-show format, &quot;Top of the Pops: Big Hits&quot;. The first programme covered the period from 1964 to 1975 (the era prior to the full-show reruns starting in 1976) and subsequent editions have compiled a selection of music from each year. Similarly to &quot;TOTP2&quot;, the &quot;Big Hits&quot; programmes provide additional information over each performance in the form of onscreen captions; however, &quot;Big Hits&quot; does not have a voiceover. A Christmas show in the &quot;Big Hits&quot; format, &quot;Top of the Pops: Christmas Hits&quot; aired on BBC Four in 2016, with no Christmas &quot;TOTP2&quot; running that year.

The 2017 Christmas show was the last episode of &quot;TOTP2&quot; to be produced and broadcast, though past episodes are still repeated on BBC Two and BBC Four.

==Controversies==
In September 2014, the BBC accidentally transmitted an episode containing footage of disgraced presenter Jimmy Savile, posthumously revealed to be a prolific sexual abuser which resulted in seven viewer complaints and a statement of apology by the BBC. The offending footage was subsequently removed from BBC iPlayer. The repeat run of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on BBC Four was already omitting episodes featuring Savile and Dave Lee Travis (due to a suspended sentence), while Jonathan King&#x27;s reviews of the American charts were edited out of the repeats, due to his conviction. Additionally, performances by Gary Glitter are also no longer shown following the singer&#x27;s conviction for downloading child pornography.

==Presentation==
The original opening sequence, used between 1994 and 1998 used a &#x27;rewind&#x27; theme to represent the show&#x27;s rewound content. Paula Williams devised the concept by filming abstract objects in a studio on 16mm film with bold &#x27;pop&#x27; colours. The sequence was edited and composited at Red Post Production on Flame. The presentation style of &quot;TOTP2&quot; in 1994 was actually ahead of parent show, Top of the Pops, which didn&#x27;t get a similar presentation update until 1995.

Since 1998, the presentation of &quot;TOTP2&quot; has generally followed the style of parent show, Top of the Pops. &quot;TOTP2&quot; used modified versions of the May 1998–December 2001 and January 2002–November 2003 titles during those eras of the show. However, between November 2003 and December 2005, an original title sequence based around the 2003 Top of the Pops spiral logo was used alongside the original version of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; by CCS.

==Episode guide==
This is a guide to show a list of new episodes not in a particular series of &quot;TOTP2&quot;, broadcast since December 2008.

==On other channels==
From 2004 onwards, repeats of edited episodes of &quot;TOTP2&quot; have been shown on a number of UKTV channels, including Dave, and Yesterday. Recent episodes of the show are also repeated on BBC Two and BBC Four occasionally.

<doc id="605843" wikidata="Q48765" url="?curid=605843" title="Stanley Donen">
<text>Stanley Donen ( ; April 13, 1924 – February 21, 2019) was an American film director and choreographer. He received the Honorary Academy Award in 1998, and the Career Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 2004. Four of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress.

Donen began his career as a dancer in the chorus line on Broadway for director George Abbott. From 1943, he worked in Hollywood as a choreographer before collaborating with Gene Kelly where Donen worked as a contract director for MGM under producer Arthur Freed. Donen and Kelly directed the films &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949), &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955). Donen&#x27;s relationship with Kelly deteriorated during their final collaboration. His other films during this period include &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; (1951), &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954), and &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957).

He then broke his contract with MGM to become an independent film producer in 1957. Donen received acclaim for his later films including the romance films &quot;Indiscreet&quot; (1958), &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), and &quot;Two for the Road&quot; (1967). He also directed the spy thriller &quot;Arabesque&quot; (1966), the British comedy &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967), the musicals &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Little Prince&quot; (1974), the dramedy &quot;Lucky Lady&quot; (1975), and the sex comedy &quot;Blame It on Rio&quot; (1984).

==Early life and stage career==
Stanley Donen was born on April 13, 1924, in Columbia, South Carolina to Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, and Helen (Cohen), the daughter of a jewelry salesman. His younger sister Carla Donen Davis was born in August 1937. Born to Jewish parents, Donen became an atheist in his youth. Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy as one of the few Jews in Columbia, and he was occasionally bullied by antisemitic classmates at school. To help cope with his isolation, Donen spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical &quot;Flying Down to Rio&quot;. Donen said that he &quot;must have seen the picture thirty or forty times. I was transported into some sort of fantasy world where everything seemed to be happy, comfortable, easy and supported. A sense of well-being filled me.&quot; He shot and screened home movies with an 8 mm camera and projector that his father bought for him.

Inspired by Astaire, Donen took dance lessons in Columbia and performed at the local Town Theater. His family often traveled to New York City during summer vacations where he saw Broadway musicals and took dance lessons. One of his early instructors in New York was Ned Wayburn, who taught eleven-year-old Astaire in 1910. After graduating from high school at the age of sixteen, Donen attended the University of South Carolina for one summer semester, studying psychology. Encouraged by his mother, he moved to New York City to pursue dancing on stage in the fall of 1940. After two auditions, he was cast as a chorus dancer in the original Broadway production of Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Pal Joey&quot;, directed by George Abbott. The titular Pal Joey was played by the young up-and-comer Gene Kelly, who became a Broadway star in the role.

Abbott cast Donen in the chorus of his next Broadway show &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;. He became the show&#x27;s assistant stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer. Eventually Donen was fired from &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;, but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott&#x27;s next show &quot;Beat the Band&quot;. In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for &quot;Call Me Mister&quot;.

==Film career==

===1943–1949: Hollywood choreographer===

In 1943 Arthur Freed, the producer of musical films at Metro Goldwyn Mayer, bought the film rights to &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot; and made a film version starring Lucille Ball and William Gaxton. Donen moved to Hollywood to audition for the film and signed a one-year contract with MGM. Donen appeared as a chorus dancer and was made assistant choreographer by Charles Walters. At MGM Donen renewed his friendship with Kelly, who was now a supporting actor in musicals. When Kelly was loaned to Columbia Pictures for a film, he was offered the chance to choreograph his own dance numbers and asked Donen to assist. Kelly stated: &quot;Stanley needed a job. I needed someone to count for the cameraman, someone who knew the steps and could explain what I was going to do so the shot was set up correctly.&quot; Donen accepted and choreographed three dance sequences with Kelly in &quot;Cover Girl&quot; (1944). Donen came up with the idea for the &quot;Alter Ego&quot; dance sequence where Kelly&#x27;s reflection jumps out of a shop window and dances with him. Director Charles Vidor insisted that the idea would never work, so Donen and Kelly directed the scene themselves and Donen spent over a year editing it. The film made Kelly a movie star and is considered by many film critics to be an important and innovative musical. Donen signed a one-year contract with Columbia and choreographed several films there, but returned to MGM the following year when Kelly wanted assistance on his next film.
In 1944, Donen and Kelly choreographed the musical &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, released in 1945 and starring Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The film is best known for its groundbreaking scene in which Kelly dances with Jerry the Mouse from the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons. The animation was supervised by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and is credited to the MGM animation producer Fred Quimby, but the idea for the scene was Donen&#x27;s. Donen and Kelly originally wanted to use either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck for the sequence and met with Walt Disney to discuss the project; Disney was working on a similar idea in &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (1944) and was unwilling to license one of his characters to MGM. The duo spent two months shooting Kelly dancing and Donen spent a year perfecting the scene frame by frame. According to Barbera &quot;the net result at the preview of &quot;Anchors Away&quot; that I went to, blew the audience away&quot;.

While Kelly completed his service in the U.S. Naval Air Service as a photographer from 1944 to 1946, Donen did uncredited work as a choreographer on musical films. Of this period Donen said, &quot;I practiced my craft, working with music, track and photography. I often directed the sequences. I always tried to have an original idea about how to do musical sequences.&quot; Donen stated that he was excused from military service as 4-F due to his high blood pressure. When Kelly returned to civilian life, he and Donen directed and choreographed Kelly&#x27;s dance scenes in &quot;Living in a Big Way&quot; (1947). They then began work on an original story about two baseball players in the early 20th century who spend their off-season as vaudevillian song and dance men. This film would eventually become &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; (1949). Kelly and Donen hoped to co-direct the film, but Freed hired Busby Berkeley instead, and they only directed Kelly&#x27;s dance numbers. The film starred Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin.

===1949: &quot;On the Town&quot;===
After the success of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;, Freed gave Donen and Kelly the chance to direct &quot;On the Town&quot;, which was released in 1949. The film was an adaptation of the Betty Comden and Adolph Green Broadway musical about sailors on leave in New York City and was the first musical to feature location-filming. Donen and Kelly wanted to shoot the entire film in New York, but Freed would only allow them to spend one week away from the studio.

That week produced the film&#x27;s opening number &quot;New York, New York&quot;. Away from both studio interference and sound stage constrictions, Donen and cinematographer Harold Rosson shot a scene on the streets of New York City that pioneered many cinematic techniques that would be adopted by the French New Wave a decade later. These techniques included spatial jump cuts, 360-degree pans, hidden cameras, abrupt changes of screen direction and non-professional actors. Donen&#x27;s biographer Joseph A. Casper stated that the scene avoids being gratuitous or amateurish, while still &quot;developing plot, describing the setting while conveying its galvanizing atmosphere and manic mood, introducing and delineating character.&quot; Casper also said: &quot;Today the film is regarded as a turning point: the first bona fide musical that moved dance, as well as the musical genre, out of the theater and captured it &quot;with&quot; and &quot;for&quot; film rather than &quot;on&quot; film; the first to make the city an important character; and the first to abandon the chorus.&quot;

&quot;On the Town&quot; starred Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin as three sailors on a 24-hour shore leave in New York whose romantic pursuits lead them to Ann Miller, Betty Garrett and Vera-Ellen. The film was a success both financially and critically and won the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture while screenwriters Comden and Green won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. Like Orson Welles, Donen made his directorial debut at 25. Donen stated that Kelly was &quot;responsible for most of the dance movements. I was behind the camera in the dramatic and musical sequences.&quot; Kelly believed that he and Donen &quot;were a good team. I thought we complemented each other very well&quot; he said.

===1949–1952: MGM contract director===

After the success of &quot;On the Town&quot;, Donen signed a seven-year contract with MGM as a director. His next two films were for Freed, but were made without Kelly&#x27;s participation. After being replaced as director on &quot;Pagan Love Song&quot; over personal differences with star Esther Williams, Donen was given the chance to direct his boyhood idol Fred Astaire.

&quot;Royal Wedding&quot; (1951) starred Astaire and Jane Powell as a brother-sister American dancing team performing in England during the royal wedding of Elizabeth and Philip in 1947. Judy Garland was originally cast in the lead role, but was fired for absenteeism due to illness and was ultimately replaced by Powell. In the film, Powell&#x27;s love affair with a wealthy Englishman (Peter Lawford) threatens to ruin the brother-sister act, while Astaire finds his own romance with another dancer (Sarah Churchill). The film is loosely based on Astaire&#x27;s real-life career with his sister and early dancing partner, Adele Astaire, who retired after marrying an English lord in 1932 and includes one of Astaire&#x27;s best remembered dance sequences, the &quot;You&#x27;re All the World to Me&quot; number where he appears to defy gravity by dancing first on the walls and then on the ceiling. The shot was achieved by building the set inside a steel-reinforced rotating cylindrical chamber, with the camera attached to the cylinder. Both Astaire and the film&#x27;s lyricist Alan Jay Lerner claimed that they thought of the idea. The film included music by Lerner and Burton Lane and was released in March 1951.

Next, Donen made &quot;Love Is Better Than Ever&quot;, which was not released until March 1952. The film stars Larry Parks as a streetwise show business agent who is compelled to marry an innocent young dance teacher (Elizabeth Taylor). Donen and Kelly appear in cameo roles. The reason for the film&#x27;s delayed release (by over a year) was Parks&#x27;s appearance before the House Un-American Activities Committee and his eventual admission of his former membership in the Communist Party, and for naming other participants. The film was unsuccessful at the box-office.

===1952: &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;===
Donen teamed again with Kelly — who was at the height of his fame after the release of &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951) — to make &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), which would become one of the most highly praised films of all time. The film was produced by Freed, written by Comden and Green, photographed by Harold Rosson and starred Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Donald O&#x27;Connor, Jean Hagen, Millard Mitchell and Cyd Charisse.

Donen, along with Kelly, were brought in by Freed (who also hired Comden and Green to write a script) to make a musical using old songs that he and composer Nacio Herb Brown wrote in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Comden and Green decided to write a story inspired by the time period in which the songs were written, and satirized Hollywood&#x27;s transition from silent films to sound films in the late 1920s. Comden, Green and Donen interviewed everyone at MGM who was in Hollywood during that period, poking fun at both the first movie musicals and the technical difficulties with early sound films. This included characters loosely based on Freed and Berkeley and a scene that references silent film star John Gilbert. Donen and Kelly also made use of MGM&#x27;s large collection of sets, props, costumes and outdated equipment from the 1920s.
In the film, Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Hagen) are two silent film stars in Hollywood whose careers are threatened by the invention of sound films. With help from his best friend Cosmo Brown (O&#x27;Connor) and love interest Kathy Selden (Reynolds), Lockwood saves his career by turning his latest film into a musical. Filming was harmonious, but Donen thought Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; ballet sequence was too long. The &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; musical number took several months to choreograph, and Donen and Kelly found it necessary to dig holes in the cement to create puddles in the street.

The film was a hit when it was released in April 1952, earning over $7.6 million. Kelly&#x27;s &quot;An American in Paris&quot; had been a surprise Best Picture winner at the Oscars in March, and MGM decided to re-release it. &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; got pulled from many theaters to showcase the earlier film, preventing it from making further profits. &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actress for Hagen and Best Original Score. Donald O&#x27;Connor won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and Comden and Green once again won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. Initially the film received only moderate reviews from critics such as Bosley Crowther and did not begin to receive widespread acclaim until the late 1960s. One of its early supporters was critic Pauline Kael, who said that it &quot;is perhaps the most enjoyable of all movie musicals – just about the best Hollywood musical of all time.&quot; It was re-released in 1975 to critical and popular success.

===1952–1955: Further success and break with MGM===

Now established as a successful film director, Donen continued his solo career at MGM with &quot;Fearless Fagan&quot; (1952). Based on a true story, the film stars Carleton Carpenter as a GI who brings his tame lion with him when he joins the army. Donen&#x27;s musical &quot;Give a Girl a Break&quot; (1953) stars Debbie Reynolds, Marge Champion and Helen Wood as three aspiring dancers competing for the lead in a new Broadway musical. Bob Fosse, Gower Champion and Kurt Kasznar also appear, with music by Burton Lane and Ira Gershwin. The &quot;Give a Girl a Break&quot; dance between Reynolds and Fosse was choreographed backwards and then played in reverse to create the illusion that the two are surrounded by hundreds of balloons that instantly appear at the touch of their fingers. Shooting the film became a bitter experience for Donen due to a major on-set fight over the film&#x27;s choreography between Fosse and Gower Champion. The film was not well reviewed upon release, but its reputation has grown over time.

Donen solidified his solo career and scored another hit with the musical &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954). Based on a short story by Stephen Vincent Benét, the film&#x27;s music is by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul, with lyrics by Johnny Mercer and choreography by Michael Kidd. Jane Powell plays Milly, an 1850s frontierswoman who marries Adam (Howard Keel) only hours after meeting him. When she returns with Adam to his log cabin in the Oregon backwoods, Milly discovers that her husband&#x27;s six brothers are uncivilized and oafish. She makes it her mission to domesticate them and, upon Milly&#x27;s sarcastic suggestion, the brothers kidnap six women from a neighboring town to marry them. The film was shot in the new CinemaScope format and is remembered for its dance sequences, particularly the &quot;barn raising scene&quot; in which architecture and construction become acrobatic ballet steps. &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; was one of the highest-grossing films of 1954 and appeared on many critics&#x27; 10 Best Films lists. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Music (Scoring of a Musical Picture), which it won. Its success was a surprise to MGM, which invested more money in two other musicals: &quot;Rose Marie&quot; and &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, starring Kelly. &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; was more profitable than either of the other films, as well as &quot;On the Town&quot; and &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, and its success was a major turning point for Donen&#x27;s career. The film was later criticized by novelist Francine Prose, who described it as anti-woman, calling it &quot;one of the most repulsive movies about men and women that has ever been made&quot; and a musical about rape.

&quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; (1954), is Donen&#x27;s biographical film concerning Sigmund Romberg, the Hungarian-born American operetta composer. Starring José Ferrer, the film included cameos by many MGM contract actors, including the only screen pairing of Gene Kelly and his brother Fred. Although it received mediocre reviews, Romberg&#x27;s status helped make the film a hit.

Donen&#x27;s third and final directorial collaboration with Kelly was &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955), another musical. It was produced by Freed, written by Comden and Green and the score was by André Previn. It starred Kelly, Dan Dailey, Cyd Charisse, Michael Kidd, and Dolores Gray. Envisioned as a sequel to &quot;On the Town&quot;, Kelly, Dailey and Kidd play three ex-GIs who reunite 10 years after World War II and discover that none of their lives have turned out how they had expected. Kelly approached Donen with the project and at first Donen was reluctant due to his own success. Their friendship deteriorated during production and Donen noted, &quot;the atmosphere from day one was very tense and nobody was speaking to anybody.&quot; He called it a &quot;one hundred percent nightmare&quot; which was a &quot;struggle from beginning to end&quot;. This time, MGM refused to allow the co-directors to shoot on location in New York. &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; was moderately profitable, but not as successful as their previous two films. It was Donen&#x27;s last film with Kelly or Freed. After its completion he fulfilled his MGM contract agreement by working with other studios. His last project for MGM was completing the final four days of shooting on &quot;Kismet&quot; in July 1955 for director Vincente Minnelli.

===1956–1959: director and independent producer===

Donen&#x27;s next film was at Paramount Pictures for producer Roger Edens. &quot;Funny Face&quot; (1957) contains four of the original George and Ira Gershwin songs from the otherwise unrelated 1927 Broadway musical of the same name that had starred Fred Astaire. Loosely based on the life of fashion photographer Richard Avedon, who was also the visual consultant and designed the opening title sequence for the film, it was written by Leonard Gershe and included additional music by Gershe and Edens. Donen and Edens began pre-production at MGM, but had difficulty juggling Astaire and Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s Paramount contracts, the Warner Brothers-owned rights to the Gershwin music that they wanted and their own MGM contracts. Eventually a deal was reached that both released Donen from his MGM contract and allowed him to make his next two films at Paramount and Warner Brothers respectively. Astaire plays an aging fashion photographer who discovers the intellectual bohemian Hepburn at a used bookstore in Greenwich Village and turns her into his new model while falling in love with her in Paris. Donen, Avedon and cinematographer Ray June collaborated to give the film an abstract, smokey look that resembled the fashion photography of the period despite protests by Paramount, which had recently invested in the sharp VistaVision film format. &quot;Funny Face&quot; was screened in competition at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival and received good reviews from critics like Bosley Crowther. &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, in contrast, accused it of being anti-intellectual.

While in pre-production on &quot;Funny Face&quot;, Donen received a letter from his old boss George Abbott inviting him to make a film version of Abbott&#x27;s stage hit &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; at Warner Brothers. As part of the deal to secure the Warner-owned Gershwin music he wanted for &quot;Funny Face&quot;, Donen accepted the offer and he and Abbott co-directed the film version. &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (1957) stars Doris Day and John Raitt, with music by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross and choreography by Bob Fosse. Raitt plays a plant supervisor at a nightwear factory who is in constant disputes with the plant&#x27;s union organizer (Day), until they end up falling in love. Donen described his working relationship with Abbott as relaxed, stating that &quot;[Abbott would] play tennis, come watch on the set for an hour, then watch the rushes, then go home.&quot; It was only a modest financial success, but Jean-Luc Godard praised it and declared &quot;Donen is surely the master of the movie musical. &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; exists to prove it.&quot;

Donen&#x27;s next film was &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; (also 1957). He was personally asked by Cary Grant to direct and began developing it while still under contract at MGM. With a plot that strongly resembles &quot;On the Town&quot;, the film features Grant, Ray Walston and Larry Blyden as three navy officers on leave in San Francisco in 1944. Unlike &quot;On the Town&quot;, &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; is a dark comedy that contrasts the officers&#x27; selfless heroism with their self-absorbed hedonism while on leave. The film received mostly poor reviews.

After three films released in 1957, Donen became an independent producer and director. He had reluctantly agreed to direct &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; on condition that 20th Century Fox buy out his remaining contract with MGM. Now free from contractual obligations, he formed Grandon Productions with Grant and signed a distribution deal through Warner Brothers. Donen would self-produce nearly all of his films for the rest of his career, sometimes under the name &quot;Stanley Donen Productions&quot;. Donen and Grant inaugurated their company with &quot;Indiscreet&quot; (1958), based on a play by Norman Krasna and starring Grant and Ingrid Bergman. Because of Bergman&#x27;s schedule, the film was shot on location in London. Bergman plays a famous and reclusive actress who falls in love with the supposedly married playboy-diplomat Grant. When Bergman discovers that he has been lying about having a wife, she concocts a charade with another man in order to win Grant&#x27;s full affection. A scene in the film involves Donen&#x27;s clever circumvention of the strict Production Code. In the scene, Grant is in Paris while Bergman is still in London and the two exchange pillow talk over the phone. Donen used a split screen of the two stars with synchronized movements to make it appear as though they were in the same bed together. The film was a financial and critical success, and Donen was compared to such directors as Ernst Lubitsch and George Cukor.

Donen briefly returned to the musical genre with &quot;Damn Yankees!&quot; (also 1958), based on George Abbott&#x27;s Broadway hit. He again co-directed with Abbott in the same hands-off collaboration as their first film. Like &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; the film includes music by Adler and Ross and choreography by Fosse. It starred Tab Hunter, Gwen Verdon, and Ray Walston. &quot;Damn Yankees!&quot; is an adaptation of the Faust legend about a fan of the Washington Senators who would sell his soul to give the losing team a good hitter. Walston plays the Brooks Brothers-attired Devil who grants the fan his wish and transforms him into the muscular young hitter Joe Hardy (Hunter). Donen was able to shoot three real Senator–Yankee games on location with seven hidden cameras. The low-budget film was a moderate financial success and received good reviews. It was also Donen&#x27;s last musical film until &quot;The Little Prince&quot; (1974).

===1960–1969: United Kingdom===
After &quot;Indiscreet&quot; Donen made England his home until the early 1970s. Musicals&#x27; waning popularity caused Donen to focus on comedy films. He observed that his &quot;London base afforded me the advantage of being away from the Hollywood rat race. Just going your own way in spite of whatever anyone else is doing or in spite of what you&#x27;ve done already was satisfying. I also had the advantage of the European influence: their way of looking at life, of making movies.&quot; While in the UK in the early 1960s, Donen was praised as an early influence on the then-emerging British New Wave film movement.

In the late 1950s, Donen signed a non-exclusive, three-film deal with Columbia Pictures. His first film under this contract was &quot;Once More, with Feeling!&quot; (1960). Adapted by Harry Kurnitz from his own stage play, the film was shot in Paris and starred Yul Brynner as a tyrannical orchestra conductor whose mistress (Kay Kendall) grows tired of his tantrums and plots to marry him in order to quickly divorce him for his money. Kendall was terminally ill with leukemia during the shoot and died before its release. The film was not successful financially or critically.

Donen quickly re-teamed with Brynner and Kurnitz for the film &quot;Surprise Package&quot; (also 1960). In this film Brynner plays an American gangster who is deported to the Greek island of Rhodes. Mitzi Gaynor plays the &quot;surprise package&quot; who is sent to the island to appease Brynner, and Noël Coward plays the King of Rhodes whom Brynner plots to dethrone. The film was not a financial success, and Donen stated that it was made because he &quot;desperately needed money for personal reasons.&quot; These were the only two films that Donen completed for his Columbia contract. The studio cancelled the deal after their poor box-office returns, and Donen was unable to produce the projects that he was pursuing at that time: playwright Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; and &quot;A Patch of Blue&quot;, both of which became successful films for other directors.

Grandon Productions produced Donen&#x27;s next film: &quot;The Grass Is Greener&quot;, released through Universal Pictures in December 1960. Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr play the earl and countess of a large estate in England who are forced to permit guided tours of their mansion in order to help their financial problems. Robert Mitchum plays an American oil tycoon who falls in love with Kerr and Jean Simmons plays an eccentric American heiress who is Grant&#x27;s former girlfriend. The film was a financial disappointment in the United States, but was successful in England where the original stage version had been a West End hit.

One of Donen&#x27;s most praised films was &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), starring Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. Donen said that he had &quot;always wanted to make a movie like one of my favorites, Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;North by Northwest&quot;&quot; and the film has been referred to as &quot;the best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made.&quot; &quot;Charade&quot; was produced by Stanley Donen Productions, released through Universal and adapted by Peter Stone from his own novel. Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) discovers that her husband has been murdered and (at least) three sinister men are all searching for the $250,000 in gold that he had hidden somewhere. Peter Joshua (Grant) befriends Reggie and helps her fight off the three thugs while the two begin to fall in love. The film was released in December 1963, only two weeks after the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy, and the word &quot;assassinate&quot; had to be redubbed twice. It was Donen&#x27;s most financially successful film and influenced a number of romantic comedy-thrillers released in the years following it. Film critic Judith Crist called it a &quot;stylish and amusing melodrama&quot;, and Pauline Kael said it had &quot;a freshness and spirit that makes [it] unlike the films of any other country&quot; and was &quot;probably the best American film of [1963]&quot;. It was remade as &quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot; (2002), directed by Jonathan Demme.

Donen made another Hitchcock-inspired film with &quot;Arabesque&quot; (1966), starring Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren. The film was written by Julian Mitchell and Stanley Price, with an uncredited rewrite by Peter Stone. Peck plays an American professor at Oxford University who is an expert in ancient hieroglyphics. He is approached by a Middle Eastern prime minister to investigate an organization that is attempting to assassinate him and uses hieroglyphic codes to communicate. The investigation leads Peck to one mystery after another, often involving the prime minister&#x27;s mysterious mistress (Loren). The film was Donen&#x27;s second consecutive hit.

Donen made &quot;Two for the Road&quot; (1967), starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney with Eleanor Bron, William Daniels, and Jacqueline Bisset in supporting roles. The film was conceived by Donen and written by novelist Frederic Raphael, who was nominated for an Academy Award. It has been called one of Donen&#x27;s most personal films, &quot;with glints of passion never disclosed before&quot;, and &quot;a veritable textbook on film editing.&quot; The film&#x27;s complicated and non-linear story is about the 12-year relationship between Hepburn and Finney over the course of four separate (but interwoven) road trips that they take together throughout the years in the south of France. It was moderately successful at the box-office while the critical reception was extremely mixed. Bosley Crowther called the film &quot;just another version of commercial American trash.&quot; It is also the film that Donen said he was most frequently asked about by film students.

While living in England, Donen became an admirer of the British stage revue &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; and wished to work with two of the show&#x27;s participants, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. The resulting film was &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967), an updated version of the Faust legend. It was written by Cook with music by Moore, and also starred Eleanor Bron and Raquel Welch. Moore plays a lonely young man whose unrequited love of his co-worker (Bron) drives him to attempt suicide. Just then the devil (Cook) appears and offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. The film&#x27;s fun-loving association with the Swinging London of the 1960s divided critics, but Roger Ebert called its satire &quot;barbed and contemporary ... dry and understated&quot;, and overall, a &quot;magnificently photographed, intelligent, very funny film.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called it the feeblest of all known variations on the Faust theme. The film was a hit and was especially popular among American college students. Donen considered it a favorite among his own films and called it &quot;a very personal film in that I said a great deal about what I think is important in life.&quot; It was remade as &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (2000) by director Harold Ramis.

&quot;Staircase&quot; (1969) is Donen&#x27;s adaptation of the autobiographical stage play by Charles Dyer with music by Dudley Moore. Rex Harrison and Richard Burton star as a middle-aged gay couple who run a London barber shop and live together in a &quot;bad marriage&quot;. The film was shot in Paris for tax purposes and was not a financial success. It received poor reviews upon release, but was re-evaluated by film critic Armond White in 2007. He called the film &quot;a rare Hollywood movie to depict gay experience with wisdom, humor and warmth&quot;, and &quot;a lost treasure&quot;.

===1970–2003: Later works===
After Donen&#x27;s marriage to Adelle Beatty ended, he moved back to Hollywood in 1970. Producer Robert Evans asked Donen to direct an adaptation of the beloved children&#x27;s book &quot;The Little Prince&quot; first published in 1943. Lyricist Alan Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe wrote the music and screenplay and filming was done on location in Tunisia. &quot;The Little Prince&quot; (1974) stars Steven Warner in the title role, with Richard Kiley, Bob Fosse, Gene Wilder and Donna McKechnie. It was Donen&#x27;s first musical film since &quot;Damn Yankees!&quot; Although it contained very little dancing, Fosse choreographed his own dance scenes as the snake. Lerner stated that Donen &quot;took it upon himself to change every tempo, delete musical phrases at will and distort the intention of every song until the entire score was unrecognizable&quot;. It was released in 1974 and was a financial disaster.

Donen&#x27;s next film was &quot;Lucky Lady&quot; (1975), starring Liza Minnelli, Gene Hackman and Burt Reynolds. Minnelli plays a Prohibition era bootlegger who smuggles alcohol from Mexico to California with the help of Hackman and Reynolds, who both compete for her affection. Donen stated that he &quot;really cared about [the film] and gave three years of my life to it ... I think it&#x27;s a very good movie.&quot; It went over budget and was unsuccessful at the box office. Most critics were unenthusiastic; however, Jay Cocks praised the film for having &quot;the glistening surface and full-throttle frivolity that characterized Hollywood films in the 1930s.&quot;

Nostalgia for old Hollywood movies would be a theme of Donen&#x27;s next film: &quot;Movie Movie&quot; (1978), produced by Lew Grade&#x27;s ITC Entertainment and scripted by Larry Gelbart and Sheldon Keller. The film is actually two shorter films presented as an old fashioned double feature, complete with a fake movie trailer and an introduction by comedian George Burns. It starred George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, Red Buttons, Michael Kidd and Eli Wallach and premiered in competition at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival in 1978. The first of the two films is &quot;Dynamite Hands&quot;, a black and white tribute to boxing – morality films. The second film is &quot;Baxter&#x27;s Beauties of 1933&quot;, a tribute to the extravagant musicals of Busby Berkeley. Like Donen&#x27;s previous two films, it was unsuccessful financially, although the reviews were more positive. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby called the film &quot;Hollywood flimflamming at its elegant best.&quot;

Donen made the science fiction film &quot;Saturn 3&quot; (1980), starring Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel. Donen first read the script when its writer (and &quot;Movie Movie&quot;″s set designer) John Barry showed it to him, prompting Donen to pass it along to Lew Grade. Donen was initially hired to produce, but Grade asked him to complete the film when first-time director Barry was unable to direct. According to Donen &quot;only a tiny bit of what Barry shot ended up in the finished film.&quot; It was a critical and financial disaster and initially Donen did not want to be credited as director. In the early 1980s, Donen was attached to direct an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and worked with writer Jeffrey Boam on the script. Donen eventually dropped out of the project and David Cronenberg directed the film a few years later. Boam stated that Donen was initially attracted to making the film because he wanted to &quot;connect with contemporary youthful audiences&quot; and that the script that they worked on together was &quot;very close to the script that David wound up making.&quot;

Donen&#x27;s last theatrical film was &quot;Blame It on Rio&quot; (1984). The film is a remake of the Claude Berri film &quot;&quot; (1977) and was written by Gelbart and Charlie Peters. It stars Michael Caine, Joseph Bologna, Michelle Johnson, Valerie Harper and Demi Moore and was shot on location in Rio de Janeiro. Caine and Bologna play wealthy executives on vacation with their families in Rio, where Caine has an affair with Bologna&#x27;s teenage daughter (Johnson). It received poor reviews, but was a modest success financially.

In 1986, Donen produced the televised ceremony of the 58th Academy Awards, which included a musical performance of the song &quot;Once a Star, Always a Star&quot; with June Allyson, Leslie Caron, Marge Champion, Cyd Charisse, Kathryn Grayson, Howard Keel, Ann Miller, Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds, and Esther Williams. Also in 1986 Donen directed a musical sequence for an episode of the popular TV series &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and directed the music video for Lionel Richie&#x27;s song &quot;Dancing on the Ceiling&quot;, which employed the same rotating-room filming techniques that he used in &quot;You&#x27;re All the World to Me&quot; from &quot;Royal Wedding&quot;. In 1989 Donen was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from the University of South Carolina. In his commencement address, Donen stated that he thought he was unique in being the first tap dancer to be a doctor and then tap danced for the graduates. At around the same time Donen taught a seminar on film musicals at the Sundance Institute at the request of Robert Redford.

In 1993, Donen was preparing to produce and direct a movie musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; starring Michael Jackson. After allegations that Jackson had molested young boys at his Neverland Ranch became a tabloid scandal, the project was abandoned. Later that year Donen directed the stage musical &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (based on the Powell and Pressburger film) at the Gershwin Theatre. He replaced the original director Susan Schulman just six weeks before the show opened. It closed after four days.

Donen&#x27;s last film was the television movie &quot;Love Letters&quot;, which aired in April 1999. The film starred Steven Weber and Laura Linney and was based on the play by A. R. Gurney. Weber plays a successful U.S. Senator who finds out that his long lost love (Linney) has recently died. The two had only corresponded through mail over the years, and Weber remembers Linney through his collection of old love letters. Donen had wanted to make a theatrical film version of the play, but was unable to secure financing from any major studio and instead took the project to ABC. In 2002 Donen directed Elaine May&#x27;s musical play &quot;Adult Entertainment&quot; starring Danny Aiello and Jeannie Berlin in Stamford, Connecticut. In 2004 he was awarded the Career Golden Lion at the 61st Venice International Film Festival.

== Technical innovation ==
=== Style ===
Donen is credited with having made the transition of Hollywood musical films from realistic backstage dramas to a more integrated art form in which the songs were a natural continuation of the story. Before Donen and Kelly made their films, musicals – such as the extravagant and stylized work of Busby Berkeley – were often set in a Broadway stage environment where the musical numbers were part of a stage show. Donen and Kelly&#x27;s films created a more cinematic form and included dances that could only be achieved in the film medium. Donen stated that what he was doing was a &quot;direct continuation from the Astaire – Rogers musicals ... which in turn came from René Clair and from Lubitsch ... What &quot;we&quot; did was not geared towards realism but towards the unreal.&quot;

Donen is highly respected by film historians, but his career is often compared to Kelly&#x27;s, and there is debate over who deserves more credit for their collaborations. Their relationship was complicated, both professionally and personally, but Donen&#x27;s films as a solo director are generally better regarded by critics than Kelly&#x27;s. French film critic Jean-Pierre Coursodon has said that Donen&#x27;s contribution to the evolution of the Hollywood musical &quot;outshines anybody else&#x27;s, including Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s&quot;. David Quinlan called him &quot;the King of the Hollywood musicals&quot;.

===Cine-dance===
Donen made a host of critically acclaimed and popular films. His most important contribution to the art of film was helping to transition movie musicals from the realistic backstage settings of filmed theater to a more cinematic form that integrates film with dance. Eventually film scholars named this concept &quot;cine-dance&quot; (a dance that can only be created in the medium of film), and its origins are in the Donen/Kelly films. Film scholar Casey Charness described &quot;cine-dance&quot; as &quot;a melding of the distinctive strengths of dancing and filmmaking that had never been done before&quot; and adds that Donen and Kelly &quot;seem to have elevated Hollywood dance from simplistic display of either dancing or photographic ability into a perception that incorporates both what the dancer can do and what the camera can see ... [They] developed a balance between camera and dancer that ... encouraged both photographer and choreographer to contribute significantly to the creation and final effectiveness of dance.&quot;

When &quot;talkies&quot; began to gain momentum in the film industry, the Hollywood studios recruited the best talent from Broadway to make musical films, such as &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; and Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;42nd Street&quot;. These films established the backstage musical, a subgenre in which the plot revolves around a stage show and the people involved in putting it on. They set the standard for the musical genre, placing their musical numbers either within the context of a stage performance or tacked on and gratuitous, without furthering the story or developing the characters. Donen stated that he disliked them and that his own films were &quot;a reaction against those backstage musicals.&quot; Donen credited producer Freed as the driving force behind the transition, adding that Freed &quot;had some sort of instinct to change the musical from a backstage world into something else. He didn&#x27;t quite know what to change it into, just that it had to change.&quot; Kelly stated that Donen was the only person he knew that understood how musicals could progress and better suit the film medium.

===Techniques===
Donen and Kelly&#x27;s films set new standards for special effects, animation, editing and cinematography. Their first collaboration &quot;Cover Girl&quot; firmly established their intentions, particularly in the &quot;Alter Ego&quot; dance sequence. It employed a special effect that could not be achieved with a live take, while advancing the story and revealing the character&#x27;s inner conflict. Donen and Kelly tested the limits of film&#x27;s potential with the Jerry the Mouse dance in &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;, one of the first films where a live action character dances with an animated one.

By the time they made &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; they had perfected what Martin Rubin called an &quot;indication of changing trends in musical films&quot; which differed from the Berkeley spectacles towards &quot;relatively small-scale affairs that place the major emphasis on comedy, transitions to the narrative, the cleverness of the lyrics and the personalities and performance skills of the stars, rather than on spectacle and group dynamics.&quot; Rubin credits Donen and Kelly with making musicals more realistic, compared to Berkeley&#x27;s style of a &quot;separation of narrative space from performance space&quot; &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; was Berkeley&#x27;s last film as a director and today can be viewed as a passing of the torch. Both Donen and Kelly found working with Berkeley difficult, and the director left before the film&#x27;s completion.

When Donen and Kelly released &quot;On the Town&quot;, they boldly opened the film with an extravagant musical number shot on location in New York with fast-paced editing and experimental camera work, thus breaking from the conventions of that time. Their most celebrated film &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; is appropriately a musical about the birth of the movie musical. The film includes a musical montage which Donen said was &quot;doing Busby Berkeley here, only we&#x27;re making fun of him.&quot; Charness stated that &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;&#x27;s references to Berkeley &quot;marks the first time the Hollywood musical had ever been reflexive, and amused at its own extravagant non-dancing inadequacy, at that&quot; and that Berekeley&#x27;s &quot;overhead kaleidoscope floral pattern is predominantly featured, as is the line of tap-dancing chorines, who are seen only from the knees down.&quot; Charness also stated that the film&#x27;s cinematography &quot;moves the audience perspective along with the dance.&quot;

Charness singled out the film&#x27;s famous title number and states, &quot;it&#x27;s a very kinetic moment, for though there is no technically accomplished dance present, the feeling of swinging around in a circle with an open umbrella is a brilliantly apt choice of movement, one that will be readily identifiable by an audience which might know nothing kinesthetically of actual dance ... Accompanying this movement is a breathless pullback into a high crane shot that takes place at the same time Kelly is swinging into his widest arcs with the umbrella. The effect is dizzying. Perhaps the finest single example of the application of camera know-how to a dance moment in Donen-Kelly canon.&quot; He also complimented Donen&#x27;s direction in the &quot;Moses Supposes&quot; number, including &quot;certain camera techniques which Donen had by now formularized ... the dolly shot into medium shot to signify the ending of one shot and the beginning of another.&quot; Although Donen credits earlier musicals by René Clair, Lubitsch and Astaire as &quot;integrated&quot;, he also states that &quot;in the early musicals of Lubitsch and Clair, they made it clear from the beginning that their characters were going to sing operatically. Gene and I didn&#x27;t go that far. In &#x27;Moses Supposes&#x27;, he and Donald sort of talk themselves into a song.&quot; Donen&#x27;s &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; and &quot;Give A Girl A Break&quot; continued to use special effect shots to create elaborate dance sequences.

==Relationship with Gene Kelly==
Donen&#x27;s relationship with Gene Kelly was complicated and he often spoke bitterly about his former friend and mentor decades after they worked together. Kelly was never explicitly negative about Donen in later years. However, Silverman has asserted that Kelly&#x27;s comments were often condescending and demonstrated &quot;a long-standing attempt to diminish Donen&#x27;s contributions to their collective work.&quot; The reasons for their conflict were both personal (both men married dancer Jeanne Coyne) and professional (Donen always felt that Kelly did not treat him as an equal). They disagreed over who deserved more credit for their joint projects: three films as co-directors and four as co-choreographers.

===Jeanne Coyne===

At age 7 Coyne enrolled in the Gene Kelly Studio of Dance in Johnstown, Pennsylvania and developed a schoolgirl crush on him In her twenties she was cast in &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;, where she reconnected with Kelly and first met Donen, later moving to Hollywood with them. She and Donen eloped in 1948, but their marriage became strained. They separated in 1950 and divorced in 1951. During their marriage Donen confided to Coyne his frustration with Kelly while making &quot;On the Town&quot;, only to find that she immediately took Kelly&#x27;s side. Coyne worked as Kelly&#x27;s personal assistant on several films while married to Donen and continued assisting Kelly until her death. Rumors held that Kelly and Coyne were having an affair both during and after Coyne&#x27;s marriage to Donen, as well as that Donen was in love with Kelly&#x27;s first wife Betsy Blair. Blair&#x27;s autobiography makes no mention of an affair between Kelly and Coyne nor of any romantic relationship with Donen. However, she does state that Donen&#x27;s marriage to Coyne was unhappy and that Donen was very close to both her and Kelly.

Kelly said that Donen&#x27;s impulsive marriage to Coyne showed an emotional immaturity and lack of good judgment, and stated that &quot;Jeannie&#x27;s marriage to Stanley was doomed from the start. Because every time Stanley looked at Jeannie, he saw Betsy, whom he loved; and every time Jeannie looked at Stanley, I guess she saw me. One way or another it was all pretty incestuous.&quot; Kelly&#x27;s marriage to Blair ended in 1957, after which he moved in with Coyne. They married in 1960 and had two children together. Coyne died of leukemia in 1973. In November 2012 the musical &quot;What a Glorious Feeling&quot; depicted both the making of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; and the love triangle among Donen, Kelly and Coyne.

===Professional conflict===
Donen and Kelly&#x27;s relationship has been described as similar to that of the characters Don Lockwood and Cosmo Brown in &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, with Kelly as the star performer and Donen as his trusted sidekick. Kelly described Donen as being like a son to him and Donen initially idolized Kelly while finding him &quot;cold, egotistical and very rough.&quot; Although Donen credited Kelly for &quot;jump-starting his career as a filmmaker&quot;, he said that MGM producer Roger Edens was his biggest promoter.

Many people believe that Donen owed everything to Kelly, and Kelly biographer Clive Hirschhorn described Donen as having &quot;no particular identity or evident talent ... and was just a kid from the south who wanted to make it in show business.&quot; Donen stated that he moved to Hollywood of his own accord; other sources state that he followed Kelly, who then helped him get his first job. Kelly sometimes embarrassed and patronized Donen in public, such as berating him for not being able to keep up with his dance steps during the rehearsals for &quot;Cover Girl&quot;. Donen admitted that he did not consider himself to be a great performer. Despite Donen&#x27;s growing resentment of Kelly, he was able to contain his feelings and professional attitude during their collaborations. Tensions between the two exploded on the set of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot;. After Donen&#x27;s recent hits &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; and &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; he did not want to make another film with Kelly. They fought on the set for the first time, with the now more confident Donen asserting himself. Donen almost quit the film, and his friendship with Kelly ended.

Other tensions included Donen&#x27;s hit films as compared to Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (which Kelly was closely involved in and had wanted to direct) and Kelly&#x27;s own ambitious film &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot;, both of which were financially unsuccessful. During the shooting of &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, Donen often complained about his budgetary constraints, while &quot;Brigadoon&quot; had a much larger budget. Around this time Kelly&#x27;s attempts at dramatic acting with &quot;The Devil Makes Three&quot; (1952) and &quot;Seagulls Over Sorrento&quot; (1954) flopped, and his marriage to Betsy Blair was coming to an end.

In later years, Donen would state that he had nothing nice to say about Kelly. At a 1991 tribute to Comden and Green, Kelly said in a public speech that Donen &quot;needed [him] to grow up with&quot; but added &quot;I needed Stanley at the back of the camera.&quot; He also described Donen as being thought of as his whipping-boy at MGM. Although Donen often complained that Kelly never gave him enough credit for their work, Kelly did credit him for the Jerry the Mouse and &quot;Alter Ego&quot; dance sequences. In 1992 Donen said &quot;I&#x27;m grateful to him, but I paid back the debt, ten times over. And he got his money&#x27;s worth out of me.&quot; Betsy Blair claimed to be &quot;surprised and bemused&quot; about Donen&#x27;s bitterness towards Kelly.

===Directorial careers===
The relative importance of the two men&#x27;s contributions has been debated by critics. David Thomson wrote about &quot;the problem in assessing [Donen&#x27;s] career: who did what in their collaboration? And what is Donen&#x27;s real standing as a director?&quot; Thomson remarked that &quot;nothing in his career suggests that Gene Kelly could have filmed himself singing in the rain with the exhilaration of Donen&#x27;s retreating crane shot.&quot; However set reports state that Kelly rode the camera boom between shots and during camera set-ups. Donen stated that &quot;by the time you hash it through from beginning to end ten million times, you can&#x27;t remember who did what except in a few instances where you remember getting an idea.&quot; Composer Saul Chaplin said that &quot;Gene was the prime mover and Stanley an eager and talented pupil.&quot; During the shooting of &quot;On the Town&quot;, all memos and correspondence from MGM to the production were addressed exclusively to Donen and not to Kelly.

However, actress Kathleen Freeman stated that when people visited the set of &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; to relate their experiences during the silent era, they would ask to speak with Kelly. &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; art director Randall Duell stated &quot;Gene ran the show. Stan had some good ideas and worked with Gene, but he was still the &#x27;office boy&#x27; to Gene, in a sense, although Gene had great respect for him.&quot; Kelly became more involved with the &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; script during its third draft, which was when its structure began to resemble the final version. Comparing Donen and Kelly&#x27;s films as solo directors, Donen&#x27;s were usually more critically acclaimed and financially successful than Kelly&#x27;s films. Kelly&#x27;s film &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1969) is credited with effectively killing the Hollywood musical.

==Personal life==

Donen married and divorced five times and had three children. His first wife was dancer, choreographer and actress Jeanne Coyne. They married on April 14, 1948, and divorced in May 1951. Donen&#x27;s second wife was actress Marion Marshall, who had been the girlfriend and protégé of Howard Hawks and later married actor Robert Wagner. Donen and Marshall had two sons together: Peter Donen (1953–2003) and Joshua Donen, born in 1955. The boys&#x27; first names put together provided the name for Cary Grant&#x27;s character in the 1963 movie &quot;Charade&quot;. Donen and Marshall were married from 1952 to 1959. They had a lengthy custody battle over their sons after Marshall married Wagner and Donen moved to England. Donen&#x27;s third wife was Adelle, Countess Beatty. She had previously been the second wife of the 2nd Earl Beatty. They married in 1960, had one son (Mark Donen, born 1962), and lived together in London. They separated in 1969 and divorced in 1971. Donen&#x27;s fourth wife was American actress Yvette Mimieux. They were married from 1972 to 1985, but remained close friends after their divorce. Donen&#x27;s fifth wife was Pamela Braden, 36 years his junior. Donen proposed to her four days after having met her. They were married from 1990 to 1994.

In the early 1940s, Donen dated actress Judy Holliday while working on Broadway. He also dated Elizabeth Taylor for a year between his first and second marriages. In his final years Donen&#x27;s longtime companion was writer and director Elaine May, whom he dated from 1999 until his death and claimed to have proposed marriage to &quot;about 172 times.&quot;

Donen&#x27;s eldest son, Peter Donen, was a visual effects artist who worked on such films as &quot;Superman III&quot;, &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, and &quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot;. He also designed the title credits for &quot;Blame It on Rio&quot;. He died of a heart attack in 2003 at age 50. Donen&#x27;s second son, Joshua Donen, is a film producer who worked on such films as &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; and &quot;Gone Girl&quot;. Mark Donen, Stanley&#x27;s third son, worked as a production assistant on &quot;Blame It on Rio&quot;.

In 1959, Donen&#x27;s father Mordecai died at 59 in Beaufort, South Carolina] His mother Helen died in 1989 at 84 in South Carolina, and Donen delivered the eulogy at her funeral.

With the deaths in the 2000s of Billy Wilder, George Sidney, Elia Kazan, Robert Wise, and Jules Dassin, Donen became the last surviving notable film director of Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age. In his final years he occasionally appeared at film festivals and retrospectives and continued to develop ideas for film projects. He was the subject of the 2010 documentary &quot;Stanley Donen: You Just Do It&quot;.

In December 2013 it was announced that Donen was in pre-production for a new film co-written with Elaine May, to be produced by Mike Nichols. A table reading of the script for potential investors included such actors as Christopher Walken, Charles Grodin, Ron Rifkin and Jeannie Berlin. In celebration of Donen&#x27;s 90th birthday in 2014, a retrospective of his work, &quot;A Lotta Talent and a Little Luck: A Celebration of Stanley Donen&quot;, was held from July to August in Columbia, South Carolina. It included a tour of Donen&#x27;s childhood neighborhood, a lecture by Steven Silverman and film screenings at the Columbia Film Society Donen frequented as a child.

On February 21, 2019, Donen died at age 94 from heart failure in New York City,
two months short of his 95th birthday. In addition to May, he is survived by two sons and a sister.

==Honors and legacy ==


During his career Donen&#x27;s biggest rival was Vincente Minnelli, to whom he is often compared. Like Donen, Minnelli was a contract director at MGM known for the musicals he made for the Freed Unit. According to Donen&#x27;s biographer Stephen M. Silverman, critics tend to &quot;express a distinct preference for Donen&#x27;s bold, no-nonsense style of direction over Minnelli&#x27;s Impressionist visual palette and Expressionist character motivations&quot;, while most film directors are said to prefer Minnelli&#x27;s work. Michael Kidd, who worked with both directors early in his career, describes Minnelli as being much less open to collaborative suggestions than Donen. The two directors&#x27; camera work differs in that Minnelli often used forward and backwards tracking shots while Donen preferred horizontal tracking shots and crane shots. Silverman said film critics consider Donen&#x27;s approach to be better suited for dance sequences.

In 1998, Donen was chosen to receive the Honorary Academy Award at the 70th Academy Awards &quot;in appreciation of a body of work marked by grace, elegance, wit and visual innovation.&quot; Film director Martin Scorsese was chosen to present the award to Donen. Scorsese gave tribute to Donen speaking about his career and his impact on film before playing a montage of his work in the movies from &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Funny Face&quot;, to &quot;On the Town&quot; and &quot;Charade&quot;. In Donen&#x27;s acceptance speech he danced with his Oscar statue while singing Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;, a song first popularized by his boyhood idol Fred Astaire.

David Thomson dismisses most of his later comedy films, but praises him for leading &quot;the musical in a triumphant and personal direction: out of doors ... Not even Minnelli can rival the fresh-air excitement of such sequences. And few can equal his integration of song, dance and story.&quot; Andrew Sarris dismisses Donen as being without a personal style of his own and as being dependent upon his collaborators on his better films. Debbie Reynolds downplayed his contributions to &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, stating that &quot;Stanley just operated the camera, because Stanley didn&#x27;t dance.&quot;

Among Donen&#x27;s admirers are film directors Woody Allen, Pedro Almodóvar, Lindsay Anderson, Charlie Chaplin, Damien Chazelle, Jules Dassin, Guillermo del Toro William Friedkin, Jean-Luc Godard, Stanley Kubrick, Christopher McQuarrie, Karel Reisz, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, François Truffaut, and Edgar Wright. Donen&#x27;s skill as a director has been praised by such actors as Cyd Charisse, Mitzi Gaynor and Audrey Hepburn. Donen&#x27;s work influenced later directors of film musicals Bill Condon, Rob Marshall, and Baz Luhrmann The 2011 film &quot;The Artist&quot; pays tribute to &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (among other films), and Donen praised the film after attending its Los Angeles premiere.

&quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; is Donen&#x27;s most revered film and it was included in the first group of films to be inducted into the National Film Registry at the Library of Congress in 1989 and has been included on &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s prestigious list of &quot;Top Ten Films&quot; twice, in 1982 and in 2002. Chaplin and Truffaut were among its earliest admirers. Billy Wilder called the film &quot;one of the five greatest pictures ever made.&quot;

<doc id="605851" wikidata="Q191817" url="?curid=605851" title="Striated muscle tissue">
<text>Striated muscle tissue is a muscle tissue that features repeating functional units called sarcomeres. Under the microscope, sarcomeres are visible along muscle fibers, giving a striated appearance to the tissue. The two types of striated muscle are skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle.

==Structure==
Striated muscle tissue contains T-tubules which enables the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

===Skeletal muscle===
Skeletal muscle includes skeletal muscle fibers, blood vessels, nerve fibers, and connective tissue. Skeletal muscle is wrapped in epimysium, allowing structural integrity of the muscle despite contractions. The perimysium organizes the muscle fibers, which are encased in collagen and endomysium, into fascicles. Each muscle fiber contains sarcolemma, sarcoplasm, and sarcoplasmic reticulum. The functional unit of a muscle fiber is called a sarcomere.
Each muscle cell contains myofibrils composed of actin and myosin myofilaments repeated as a sarcomere. Many nuclei are present in each muscle cell placed at regular intervals beneath the sarcolemma.

Based on their contractile and metabolic phenotypes, skeletal muscle can be classified as slow-oxidative (Type I) or fast-oxidative (Type II).

===Cardiac muscle===
Cardiac muscle lies between the epicardium and the endocardium in the heart. Cardiac muscle cells generally only contain one nucleus, located in the central region. They contain many mitochondria and myoglobin. Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cells are unicellular. These cells are connected to each other by intercalated disks, which contain gap junctions and desmosomes.

==Striated versus smooth muscle==
Unlike skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue, smooth muscle tissue is not striated since there are no sarcomeres present. Skeletal muscles are attached to some component of the skeleton, and smooth muscle is found in hollow structures such as the walls of intestines or blood vessels. The fibres of striated muscle have a cylindrical shape with blunt ends, whereas those in smooth muscle are spindle-like with tapered ends. Striated muscle tissue has more mitochondria than smooth muscle. Both smooth muscle cells and cardiac muscle cells have a single nucleus, and skeletal muscle cells have many nuclei.

==Function==

The main function of striated muscle tissue is to create force and contract. These contractions in cardiac muscle will pump blood throughout the body. In skeletal muscle the contractions enable breathing, movement, and posture maintenance.

Contractions in cardiac muscle tissue are due to a myogenic response of the heart&#x27;s pacemaker cells. These cells respond to signals from the autonomic nervous system to either increase or decrease the heart rate. Pacemaker cells have autorhythmicity. The set intervals at which they depolarize to threshold and fire action potentials is what determines the heart rate. Because of the gap junctions, the pacemaker cells transfer the depolarization to other cardiac muscle fibers, in order to contract in unison.

Signals from motor neurons cause skeletal muscle fibers to depolarize and therefore release calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium drives the movement of myosin and actin filaments. The sarcomere then shortens which causes the muscle to contract. In the skeletal muscles connected to tendons that pull on bones, the mysia fuses to the periosteum that coats the bone. Contraction of the muscle will transfer to the mysia, then the tendon and the periosteum before causing the bone to move. The mysia also may bind to an aponeurosis or to fascia.

==Damage repair==
Adult humans cannot regenerate cardiac muscle tissue after an injury, which can lead to scarring and thus heart failure. Mammals have the ability to complete small amounts of cardiac regeneration during development. Other vertebrates can regenerate cardiac muscle tissue throughout their entire life span.

Skeletal muscle is able to regenerate far better than cardiac muscle due to satellite cells, which are dormant in all healthy skeletal muscle tissue. There are three phases to the regeneration process. These phases include the inflammatory response, the activation, differentiation, and fusion of satellite cells, and the maturation and remodeling of newly formed myofibrils. This process begins with the necrosis of damaged muscle fibers, which in turn induces the inflammatory response. Macrophages induce phagocytosis of the cell debris. They will eventually secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, which results in the termination of inflammation. These macrophages can also facilitate the proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells. The satellite cells re-enter the cell cycle to multiply. They then leave the cell cycle to self-renew or differentiate as myoblasts.

==Dysfunctions==
===Skeletal muscle===
*Sarcopenia (loss of skeletal muscle mass associated with aging)
*Polymyositis (chronic inflammation)
*Dermatomyositis (chronic inflammation with skin rash)
*Inclusion body myositis (common age-related inflammatory disease)

===Cardiac muscle===
*Coronary artery disease (narrowed coronary arteries)
*Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
*Cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle)

<doc id="605853" wikidata="Q7042953" url="?curid=605853" title="No. 1435 Flight RAF">
<text>No. 1435 Flight Royal Air Force, commonly abbreviated 1435 Flt, is an independent aircraft flight of the Royal Air Force (RAF). Currently operating the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4, it is based at RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands. Its role is to provide air defence for the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Four aircraft are permanently based in the islands, whilst their pilots and groundcrew are cycled through No. 1435 Flight from the various Typhoon squadrons in the United Kingdom, providing a 24-hour, 365-day quick reaction alert (QRA) role.

During the Second World War, No. 1435 Flight was a night fighter (NF) unit based at Malta, subsequently raised to squadron status, becoming the only RAF flying squadron to be given a four-digit number.

==History==
===Early years===

The Malta Night Fighter Unit (MNFU) was formed in late July 1941 at RAF Ta Kali on Malta, equipped with twelve Hawker Hurricane Mk.II fighters. The unit&#x27;s Hurricanes usually operated in pairs in conjunction with searchlights. It claimed its first successes on the night of 5/6 August, when two Fiat BR 20Ms were shot down.

No. 1435 (Night Fighter) Flight was first formed at Malta as a night fighter (NF) unit on 4 December 1941, by re-designating the Malta Night Fighter Unit. The unit remained equipped with Hawker Hurricane Mk.II fighters, but now found that the Hurricane had difficulty in intercepting fast Junkers Ju 88s over Malta, and instead began to operate night intruder missions over Sicily to catch the enemy aircraft over their own airfields, fitting its Hurricanes with external fuel tanks to increase the aircraft&#x27;s endurance. They were also used to drop supplies (and in particular money) to a British agent operating in Sicily. On 7 March, the Flight was strengthened by the addition of four radar-equipped Bristol Beaufighter night fighters.

The flight was reformed in July 1942 at RAF Luqa, also in Malta, as a day fighter unit equipped with Supermarine Spitfire, and manned by personnel from several squadrons, including No. 185, No. 249, and No. 603 Squadrons. After a brief period as No. 1435 (Fighter) Flight, at RAF Luqa, due to its size it was raised to No. 1435 Squadron on 2 August 1942 at RAF Luqa, Malta.

It converted to fighter-bomber activities in January 1943, and operated over Sicily and in Italy. It was assigned to the Balkan Air Force, carrying out operations over Albania and Yugoslavia until the end of the war.

It disbanded on 29 April 1945 at Falconara, Italy.

===Falkland Islands===


Following the Falklands War in 1982, the Flight provided an air defence unit at RAF Stanley airfield in East Falkland. As this was badly damaged during the fighting, the Flight reformed with Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR.3 &#x27;jump-jet&#x27; aircraft in late 1983, and disbanding again in May 1985.

In November 1988, when No. 23(F) Squadron converted to the Panavia Tornado F3, No. 1435 Flight was revived, equipped with four McDonnell Douglas F-4M Phantom FGR.2s. After No. 23(F) Squadron&#x27;s disbandment at RAF Mount Pleasant, the mission and equipment were transferred to No. 1435 Flight. The Phantoms were replaced in July 1992 when four Panavia Tornado F3s arrived in the Falklands.

No. 1435 Flight again re-equipped with the Eurofighter Typhoon in September 2009, when four Typhoon FGR4 aircraft arrived from RAF Coningsby.

==Heritage and traditions==
===Motto===
The Flight goes by the motto of &#x27;Protect the Right&#x27;, while the motto of the Falkland Islands is &#x27;Desire the Right&#x27;.

===Maltese heritage===
The Flight has maintained its Maltese connections, with its aircraft sporting the Maltese cross. The practice of naming the four-aircraft presence on the islands has also been maintained: they are called &#x27;Faith&#x27;, &#x27;Hope&#x27;, and &#x27;Charity&#x27;, after the legendary three Gloster Sea Gladiators that once defended Malta, and &#x27;Desperation&#x27;. &#x27;Desperation&#x27; was added to the three traditional names when Phantoms entered service in the Falklands and the flight was revived in 1988. &#x27;Faith&#x27;, &#x27;Hope&#x27;, and &#x27;Charity&#x27; fly operationally, with &#x27;Desperation&#x27; appropriately in reserve. On their retirement in 1992, one of the F-4M Phantoms was placed as the gate guardian at Mount Pleasant. The Phantoms were replaced by four Panavia Tornado F3s. The four Tornados remained in active service until they were replaced in turn by four Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4s in September 2009. Although the unit&#x27;s new aircraft do not have the traditional names applied, the four aircraft have tail codes that match (F, H, C, D).

<text>WordPress (WP, or WordPress.org) is a web content management system. It was originally created as a tool to publish blogs but has evolved to support publishing other web content, including more traditional websites, mailing lists, Internet forums, media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems, and online stores. Available as free and open-source software, WordPress is among the most popular content management systems – it was used by 22.52% of the top one million websites .

WordPress is written in the PHP Programming Language and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB Database. Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as &quot;Themes&quot;.

To function, WordPress has to be installed on a web server, either as part of an Internet hosting service or on a computer running the WordPress software package.

WordPress was released on May 27, 2003, by its founders, American developer Matt Mullenweg and English developer Mike Little. WordPress Foundation owns WordPress, WordPress projects, and other related trademarks.

== Overview ==

&quot;WordPress is a factory that makes webpages&quot; is a core analogy designed to clarify the functions of WordPress: it stores content and enables a user to create and publish webpages, requiring nothing beyond a domain and a hosting service.

WordPress has a web template system using a template processor. Its architecture is a front controller, routing all requests for non-static URIs to a single PHP file that parses the URI and identifies the target page. This allows support for more human-readable permalinks.

=== Themes ===
WordPress users may install and switch among many different themes. Themes allow users to change the look and functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content. Custom code can be added to the website by using a child theme or through a code editor. Every WordPress website requires at least one theme to be present. Themes may be directly installed using the WordPress &quot;Appearance&quot; administration tool in the dashboard, or theme folders may be copied directly into the themes directory. WordPress themes are generally classified into two categories: free and premium. Many free themes are listed in the WordPress theme directory (also known as the repository), and premium themes are available for purchase from marketplaces and individual WordPress developers. WordPress users may also create and develop their own custom themes and upload them in the WordPress directory or repository.

=== Plugins ===
WordPress&#x27; plugin architecture allows users to extend or depreciate the features and functionality of a website or blog. , WordPress.org has 59,756 plugins available, each of which offers custom functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs. However, this does not include the available premium plugins (approximately 1,500+), which may not be listed in the WordPress.org repository. These customizations range from search engine optimization (SEO) to client portals used to display private information to logged-in users, to content management systems, to content displaying features, such as the addition of widgets and navigation bars. Not all available plugins are always abreast with the upgrades, and as a result, they may not function properly or may not function at all. If the plugin developer has not tested the plugin with the last two major versions of WordPress, a warning message will be displayed on the plugin directory, informing users that the plugin may not work properly with the latest WordPress version. Most plugins are available through WordPress themselves, either via downloading them and installing the files manually via FTP or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third parties offer plugins through their websites, many of which are paid packages.

Web developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress&#x27; hook system, which consists of over 2,000 hooks (as of Version 5.7 in 2021) divided into two categories: action hooks and filter hooks.

Plugins also represent a development strategy that can transform WordPress into all sorts of software systems and applications, limited only by the imagination and creativity of programmers. These are implemented using custom plugins to create non-website systems, such as headless WordPress applications and Software as a Service (SaaS) products.

Plugins could also be used by hackers targeting sites that use WordPress, as hackers could exploit bugs in WordPress plugins instead of bugs in WordPress itself.

=== Mobile applications ===
Phone apps for WordPress exist for WebOS, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry. These applications, designed by Automattic, have options such as adding new blog posts and pages, commenting, moderating comments, replying to comments in addition to the ability to view the stats.

=== Accessibility ===
The WordPress Accessibility Coding Standards state that &quot;All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 at level AA.&quot;

=== Other features ===
WordPress also features integrated link management, a search engine–friendly, clean permalink structure; the ability to assign multiple categories to posts; and support for tagging of posts. Automatic filters are also included, providing standardized formatting and styling of text in posts (for example, converting regular quotes to smart quotes). WordPress also supports the Trackback and Pingback standards for displaying links to other sites that have themselves linked to a post or an article. WordPress posts can be edited in HTML, using the visual editor, or using one of several plugins that allow for a variety of customized editing features.

== Multi-user and multi-blogging ==
Before version 3, WordPress supported one blog per installation, although multiple concurrent copies may be run from different directories if configured to use separate database tables. WordPress Multisites (previously referred to as WordPress Multi-User, WordPress MU, or WPMU) was a fork of WordPress created to allow multiple blogs to exist within one installation but can be administered by a centralized maintainer. WordPress MU makes it possible for those with websites to host their own blogging communities, as well as control and moderate all the blogs from a single dashboard. WordPress MU adds eight new data tables for each blog.

As of the release of WordPress 3, WordPress MU has merged with WordPress.

== History ==
&quot;b2/cafelog&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;b2&quot; or &quot;catalog&quot;, was the precursor to WordPress. b2/cafelog was estimated to have been installed on approximately 2,000 blogs as of May 2003. It was written in PHP for use with MySQL by Michel Valdrighi, who was a contributing developer to WordPress until 2005. Although WordPress is the official successor, another project, b2evolution, is also in active development.

As the development of b2/cafelog slowed down, Matt Mullenweg began pondering the idea of forking b2/cafelog and new features that he would want in a new CMS, in a blog post written on January 24, 2003. Mike Little, a professional developer, became the first to comment on the blog post expressing interest to contribute. The two worked together to create the first version of WordPress, version 0.70, which was released on May 27, 2003. Christine Selleck Tremoulet, a friend of Mullenweg, suggested the name &quot;WordPress&quot;.

In 2004, the licensing terms for the competing Movable Type package were changed by Six Apart, resulting in many of its most influential users migrating to WordPress. By October 2009, the Open Source CMS MarketShare Report concluded that WordPress enjoyed the greatest brand strength of any open-source content management system.

, WordPress was used by 62.0% of all the websites whose content management system is known, and 22.52% of the top one million websites.

Starting September 2024, Mullenweg engaged WordPress, Wordpress.com, and Automattic in a dispute leading to a lawsuit with hosting company WP Engine, causing widespread community concern.

=== Awards and recognition ===
* Winner of InfoWorld&#x27;s &quot;Best of open source software awards: Collaboration&quot;, awarded in 2008.
* Winner of Open Source CMS Awards&#x27;s &quot;Overall Best Open Source CMS&quot;, awarded in 2009.
* Winner of digital synergy&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Fame CMS category in the 2010 Open Source&quot;, awarded in 2010.
* Winner of InfoWorld&#x27;s &quot;Bossie award for Best Open Source Software&quot;, awarded in 2011.

=== Release history ===
Main releases of WordPress are codenamed after well-known jazz musicians, starting from version 1.0.

Although only the current release is officially supported, security updates are backported &quot;as a courtesy&quot; to all versions as far back as 4.0.


==== WordPress 5.0 &quot;Bebo&quot; ====

The December 2018 release of WordPress 5.0, &quot;Bebo&quot;, is named in homage to the pioneering Cuban jazz musician Bebo Valdés.

It included a new default editor &quot;Gutenberg&quot; – a block-based editor; that allows users to modify their displayed content in a much more user-friendly way than prior iterations. Blocks are abstract units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a web page. Past content that was created on WordPress pages is listed under what is referred to as a Classic Block. Before Gutenberg, there were several block-based editors available as WordPress plugins, e.g. Elementor. Following the release of Gutenberg, comparisons were made between it and those existing plugins.

===== Classic Editor plugin =====
The Classic Editor plugin was created as a result of User preferences and helped website developers maintain past plugins only compatible with WordPress 4.9, giving plugin developers time to get their plugins updated &amp; compatible with the 5.0 release. Having the Classic Editor plugin installed restores the &quot;classic&quot; editing experience that WordPress has had up until the WordPress 5.0 release. The Classic Editor plugin will be supported at least until 2024.

As of August 2023, the Classic Editor plugin is active on over 5 million installations of WordPress.

== Vulnerabilities ==

Many security issues have been uncovered and patched in the software, particularly in 2007, 2008, and 2015. A cumulative list of WordPress security vulnerabilities, not all of which have been corrected in the version current at any time, is maintained by SecurityScorecard.

In January 2007, many high-profile search engine optimization (SEO) blogs, as well as many low-profile commercial blogs featuring AdSense, were targeted and attacked with a WordPress exploit. A separate vulnerability on one of the project site&#x27;s web servers allowed an attacker to introduce exploitable code in the form of a back door to some downloads of WordPress 2.1.1. The 2.1.2 release addressed this issue; an advisory released at the time advised all users to upgrade immediately.

In May 2007, a study revealed that 98% of WordPress blogs being run were exploitable because they were running outdated and unsupported versions of the software. To help mitigate this problem, WordPress made updating the software a much easier, &quot;one-click&quot; automated process in version 2.7 (released in December 2008). However, the filesystem security settings required to enable the update process can be an additional risk.

In a June 2007 interview, Stefan Esser, the founder of the PHP Security Response Team, spoke critically of WordPress&#x27; security track record, citing problems with the application&#x27;s architecture that made it unnecessarily difficult to write code that is secure from SQL injection vulnerabilities, as well as some other problems.

In June 2013, it was found that some of the 50 most downloaded WordPress plugins were vulnerable to common Web attacks such as SQL injection and XSS. A separate inspection of the top 10 e-commerce plugins showed that seven of them were vulnerable.

To promote better security and to streamline the update experience overall, automatic background updates were introduced in WordPress 3.7.

Individual installations of WordPress can be protected with security plugins that prevent user enumeration, hide resources, and thwart probes. Users can also protect their WordPress installations by taking steps such as keeping all WordPress installations, themes, and plugins updated, using only trusted themes and plugins, and editing the site&#x27;s .htaccess configuration file if supported by the webserver to prevent many types of SQL injection attacks and block unauthorized access to sensitive files. It is especially important to keep WordPress plugins updated because would-be hackers can easily list all the plugins a site uses and then run scans searching for any vulnerabilities against those plugins. If vulnerabilities are found, they may be exploited to allow hackers to, for example, upload their files (such as a web shell) that collect sensitive information.

Developers can also use tools to analyze potential vulnerabilities, including Jetpack Protect, WPScan, WordPress Auditor, and WordPress Sploit Framework developed by 0pc0deFR. These types of tools research known vulnerabilities, such as CSRF, LFI, RFI, XSS, SQL injection, and user enumeration. However, not all vulnerabilities can be detected by tools, so it is advisable to check the code of plugins, themes, and other add-ins from other developers.

In March 2015, it was reported that the Yoast SEO plugin was vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing attackers to potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands. The issue was fixed in version 1.7.4 of the plugin.

In January 2017, security auditors at Sucuri identified a vulnerability in the WordPress REST API that would allow any unauthenticated user to modify any post or page within a site running WordPress 4.7 or greater. The auditors quietly notified WordPress developers, and within six days WordPress released a high-priority patch to version 4.7.2, which addressed the problem.

As of WordPress 6.0, the minimum PHP version requirement is PHP 5.6, which was released on August 28, 2014, and which has been unsupported by the PHP Group and not received any security patches since December 31, 2018. Thus, WordPress recommends using PHP version 7.4 or greater.

In the absence of specific alterations to their default formatting code, WordPress-based websites use the canvas element to detect whether the browser can correctly render emoji. Because Tor Browser does not currently discriminate between this legitimate use of the Canvas API and an effort to perform canvas fingerprinting, it warns that the website is attempting to &#x27;extract HTML5 canvas image data. Ongoing efforts seek workarounds to reassure privacy advocates while retaining the ability to check for proper emoji rendering capability.

== Development and support ==

=== Key developers ===
Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little were co-founders of the project. Current key people are listed on WordPress&#x27;s Web site.

WordPress is also developed by its community, including &quot;WP tester&quot;, a group of volunteers who test each release. They have early access to nightly builds, beta versions, and release candidates. Errors are documented via a mailing list and the project&#x27;s Trac tool.

Though largely developed by the community surrounding it, WordPress is closely associated with Automattic, the company founded by Matt Mullenweg.

=== WordPress Foundation ===
WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that was set up to support the WordPress project. The purpose of the organization is to guarantee open access to WordPress&#x27;s software projects forever. As part of this, the organization owns and manages WordPress, WordCamp, and related trademarks. In January 2010, Matt Mullenweg formed the organization to own and manage the trademarks of WordPress project. Previously from 2006 onwards Automattic acted as a short-term owner of the WordPress trademarks. From the beginning, he intended later to place the WordPress trademarks with the WordPress Foundation, which did not yet exist in 2006 and which eventually took longer to set up than expected.

=== WordPress Photo Directory ===
On December 14, 2021, Matt Mullenweg announced the WordPress Photo Directory at the State of the Word 2021 event. It is an open-source image directory for open images maintained by the WordPress project. The image directory aims to provide an open alternative to closed image banks, such as Unsplash, Pixbaby, and Adobe Stock, whose licensing terms have become restrictive in recent years. Use in WordPress themes, for example, is restricted. In January 2022, the project began to gather volunteers, and in February, its own developer website was launched, where team representatives were next selected.

=== WordCamp developer and user conferences ===
WordCamps are casual, locally organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress. The first such event was WordCamp 2006 in August 2006 in San Francisco, which lasted one day and had over 500 attendees. The first WordCamp outside San Francisco was held in Beijing in September 2007. Since then, there have been over 1,022 WordCamps in over 75 cities in 65 countries around the world. WordCamp San Francisco 2014 was the last official annual conference of WordPress developers and users taking place in San Francisco, having now been replaced with WordCamp US. First ran in 2013 as WordCamp Europe, regional WordCamps in other geographical regions are held to connect people who are not already active in their local communities and inspire attendees to start user communities in their hometowns. In 2019, the Nordic region had its own WordCamp Nordic. The first WordCamp Asia was to be held in 2020, but cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Support ===
WordPress&#x27; primary support website is WordPress.org. This support website hosts both WordPress Codex, the online manual for WordPress and a living repository for WordPress information and documentation,
and WordPress Forums, an active online community of WordPress users.

=== Hosting ===

WordPress hosting services typically offer one-click WordPress installations, automated updates and backups, and security features to safeguard against common threats. Many also provide support and are configured for optimal performance with the CMS.

There are two primary types of WordPress hosting: shared WordPress hosting and managed WordPress hosting. Shared WordPress hosting is a budget-friendly option where multiple websites reside on a single server, sharing resources. Managed WordPress hosting includes comprehensive management of a WordPress site, including technical support, security, performance optimization, and often higher server resources, but comes at a higher price.

<text>Robert Mannyng (or Robert de Brunne; 1275 – c. 1338) was an English chronicler and Gilbertine canon. Mannyng provides a surprising amount of information about himself in his two known works, &quot;Handlyng Synne&quot; and &quot;Mannyng&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;. In these two works, Mannyng tells of his residencies at the Gilbertine houses of Sempringham (near Bourne) and Sixhills, and also at the Gilbertine priory at Cambridge, St Edmund’s.

==Upbringing==
His name, Robert de Brunne, indicates that he came from the place then known as Brunne (Bourne, Lincolnshire), thirteen kilometres south of Sempringham Priory, the mother house of the Gilbertine Order. Both places lie on the western edge of the Lincolnshire fens. He entered the house in 1288, was trained there and moved to Cambridge, probably as part of his training. He was moved on to Sixhills1 priory at (TF1787) in the Lincolnshire Wolds near Market Rasen. He will have spent most of his life at Sempringham, despite the frequent modern assertion that he was a monk of Bourne Abbey. The latter was an Arrouasian house, later regarded as Augustinian.

This interpretation is supported by Mannyng&#x27;s introduction to &quot;Handlyng Synne&quot;, in which he says that he had been at the abbey fifteen years: ten in the time of John Camelton (Hamilton) (the prior at Sempringham from c1298 to 1312), and five winters with Hamilton&#x27;s successor, John Clyntone. However, he clearly retained an interest in the people of Bourne, as he addressed &quot;Handlyng Synne&quot; &quot;to all Christian men under the sun and to good men of Bourne and specially ... the fellowship of Sempringham&quot;.

==His works==
&quot;Handlyng Synne&quot; (1303) is a twelve thousand line devotional or penitential piece, written in Middle English rhymed couplets, deriving many of its exempla from the Anglo-Norman &quot;Manuel des Peches&quot; of William of Waddington.

&quot;Mannyng&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, supposedly completed in 1338, translates Wace&#x27;s &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; for British history from the Anglo-Norman, before translating Piers Langtoft&#x27;s (Peter of Langtoft) &quot;Chronicle&quot; for English and post-Conquest history.2

==His legacy==
Mannyng was primarily a historiographer, and his significance lies in his participation in the tri-lingual tradition of writing history. His work in Middle English is part of a larger movement at the beginning of the fourteenth century towards the replacement of Latin and Anglo-Norman by written works in Middle English, but is not groundbreaking. It is as a history writer, in particular, through his indebtedness to the great twelfth century histories of Henry of Huntingdon, William of Malmesbury, and Geoffrey of Monmouth, that Mannyng stands out. His verse is often seen as rather pedestrian; however, in the exempla in &quot;Handling Synne&quot;, in particular, there is a life and a colour which give vibrancy to the tales and which make the work very entertaining to read—unlike several other contemporary penitential works.

<doc id="605866" wikidata="Q770486" url="?curid=605866" title="Gilbertine Order">
<text>The Gilbertine Order of Canons Regular was founded around 1130 by Saint Gilbert in Sempringham, Lincolnshire, where Gilbert was the parish priest. It was the only completely English religious order and came to an end in the 16th century at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Modest Gilbertine revivals have taken place in the late 20th and early 21st centuries on three continents.

==Founding==

Gilbert initially established a community for enclosed contemplative nuns. He accepted seven women whom he had taught in the village school and in 1131 founded an order of nuns based on the Cistercian Rule. Gilbert set up buildings and a cloister for them against the north wall of the church, which stood on his land at Sempringham, and gave them a rule of life, enjoining upon them chastity, humility, obedience, and charity. Their daily necessaries were passed to them through a window by some girls chosen by Gilbert from among his people.

As the serving maids requested that they too might have a dress and rule of life, on the advice of William, abbot of Rievaulx, he decided to add lay sisters to the community. Eventually Gilbert added lay brothers to work the fields. In 1139 the small order opened its first new foundation on the island of Haverholm, a gift from Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln. Each Gilbertine house now practically consisted of four communities, one of nuns, one of canons, one of lay sisters, and one of lay brothers. Over the years, more and more new foundations were established.

In 1147 he left England for Continental Europe to seek assistance, and approached the Cistercian Order at its major house in Cîteaux to take on the running of his foundations. The Cistercians declined, apparently because they felt unable to administer houses for both men and women, but Pope Eugene III, himself a Cistercian, intervened to ask the abbot, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, to assist Gilbert in drawing up Institutes for a new Order, which combined Benedictine and Cistercian influences. Pope Eugene then appointed Gilbert as the first Master of the Order of Sempringham or Gilbertines. Gilbert returned to England in 1148, and completed the order, by appointing canons, who lived according to variant of the Augustinian rule, to serve his community as priests, and to help him in the work of administration.

==Habits==
The Nuns wore a black tunic and a black scapular for work. They also wore a black lamb&#x27;s wool head-dress with a coarse black cloth veil.

The Sisters wore a dark tunic without the scapular. They also wore a sheepskin cloak and a long hood.

The Canons Regular wore a black cassock with a white hooded cloak (lined with lamb&#x27;s wool) with shoes of red leather. When labouring, they would use the scapular. In choir, they each wore a white cowl.

The Brothers wore a dark tunic with a dark cloak lined with rough skins. In church they wore a cloth cowl which descended to the heels.

==Layout==
Each Gilbertine priory had one church, divided unequally by a wall. The nuns had the larger part, and the canons the smaller. The latter would join the nuns only to celebrate mass. From the church, the nunnery normally stood to the north and the canons&#x27; lodgings to the south.

==Scandals==
Towards the end of Gilbert&#x27;s life, when he was around 90 years old, some of the lay brothers at Sempringham rose up against him, complaining of too much work and too little food. The rebels, led by two skilled craftsmen, received money from both religious and secular supporters and took their case to Rome. Pope Alexander III ruled in Gilbert&#x27;s favour, but the living conditions of the lay brothers were improved thereafter.

In the mid-twelfth century, a girl was brought to Watton Priory as a child, but had no real religious vocation. This Nun of Watton became pregnant by a lay brother, who fled, but he was brought back for punishment.

==The Middle Ages==
The Gilbertine order was always popular in England and Wales. Its houses were the final homes of the last of the Welsh royal family, young daughters, after the rest had been defeated and killed in the 1280s. Principal among these was Gwenllian who was sent to Sempringham Priory and a monument commemorating her was placed near the Priory site in the 1990s. Many English kings gave the order generous charters, and yet it always had financial problems. By the end of the 15th century, the Order was greatly impoverished, and King Henry VI exempted all of its houses from paying taxes and from any other sort of payment. He could not force his successors to do the same.

==Dissolution==

By the time of the Dissolution, there were twenty-six houses of Gilbertines, but only four of these were ranked as &quot;greater houses&quot;, having annual incomes above £200. Following the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535, these houses gave in to King Henry VIII in 1538 without a fight, surrendering &quot;of their own free will&quot;. Each nun and canon then received a pension for the rest of their lives.

The last Master of the Order, Robert Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last to surrender in December 1539, whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than £200 a year, surrendered in 1538. Holgate was already the Bishop of Llandaff but translated to become Archbishop of York in 1545.

The Gilbertines were the only purely English order (except for one short-lived house in Scotland), therefore the Dissolution marked their permanent end.

==Legacy==
The Gilbertine legacy is fairly small; only fifteen extant manuscripts are associated with the Order, originating from only five of the Gilbertine houses. Four additional works ascribed to Gilbertines, but not surviving in Gilbertine copies, include the &quot;Vita&quot; of Gilbert of Sempringham, the Gilbertine Rule, the so-called &#x27;Sempringham Continuation&#x27; to &quot;Le Livere de Reis Engleterre&quot;, and the works of Robert Mannyng.

The remains of one Gilbertine monastery, Malton Priory, have been incorporated into the parish church at Malton in North Yorkshire. The original monastery was established around 1150, and, though it has suffered considerable abuse, the surviving fragment remains impressive. Although the Priory at Sempringham was destroyed, the adjacent and contemporary parish church of St Andrew remains and some evidence of mediaeval decoration is still to be found.

The remains of Mattersey Priory are currently managed by English Heritage.

In 2001, British Channel 4 Television&#x27;s archaeological series &quot;Time Team&quot; excavated a Gilbertine monastery in Chicksands, Bedfordshire. The programme was shown in 2002 as part of series 9 of &quot;Time Team&quot;.

==Gilbertine revivals==
===Oblates of St Gilbert===
In 1983, following celebrations of the 900th anniversary of Gilbert&#x27;s birth, a number of lay people in the East Midlands undertook to sustain the memory and work of Gilbert and the Gilbertine Order by establishing a new secular order. The Oblates of St Gilbert exist to promote the Gilbertine contemplative spirit and to foster interest in the study of Gilbert and his Order. They are supported by the Cistercian monastery of Mount St Bernard Abbey in Leicestershire.

In about 1998, Carlos Aparecido Marchesani, a Catholic priest of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Paulo in Brazil, visited the Gilbertine Oblates as he had had a devotion to Saint Gilbert since his time as a seminarian in the United States. He obtained permission from his bishop to found a small religious community, the Fraternidade São Gilbert, &quot;ad experimentum&quot;, which was set up near São Paulo. This experimental community was dissolved in 2012.

===The Companions of St Gilbert of Sempringham===
A Roman Catholic Gilbertine community, The Canons Regular of St Gilbert of Sempringham (GSmp), began in 2017 in Canada within the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter. In August 2019 members discerned that a full restoration could not take place as was desired. The Companions of St Gilbert of Sempringham, which existed alongside the canons regular, not unlike a third order in structure and purpose, will now be the main expression of Gilbertine spirituality resulting from this attempt at a restoration; it had begun as a &quot;de facto&quot; association of the faithful.

==In popular fiction==
The detective novel, &quot;The Beautiful Mystery&quot; (2012), by Louise Penny is set in a fictional Gilbertine abbey in rural Quebec.

<text>In software, a spell checker (or spelling checker or spell check) is a software feature that checks for misspellings in a text. Spell-checking features are often embedded in software or services, such as a word processor, email client, electronic dictionary, or search engine.


==Design==
A basic spell checker carries out the following processes:
* It scans the text and extracts the words contained in it.
* It then compares each word with a known list of correctly spelled words (i.e. a dictionary). This might contain just a list of words, or it might also contain additional information, such as hyphenation points or lexical and grammatical attributes.
* An additional step is a language-dependent algorithm for handling morphology. Even for a lightly inflected language like English, the spell checker will need to consider different forms of the same word, such as plurals, verbal forms, contractions, and possessives. For many other languages, such as those featuring agglutination and more complex declension and conjugation, this part of the process is more complicated.

It is unclear whether morphological analysis—allowing for many forms of a word depending on its grammatical role—provides a significant benefit for English, though its benefits for highly synthetic languages such as German, Hungarian, or Turkish are clear.

As an adjunct to these components, the program&#x27;s user interface allows users to approve or reject replacements and modify the program&#x27;s operation.

Spell checkers can use approximate string matching algorithms such as Levenshtein distance to find correct spellings of misspelled words. An alternative type of spell checker uses solely statistical information, such as n-grams, to recognize errors instead of correctly-spelled words. This approach usually requires a lot of effort to obtain sufficient statistical information. Key advantages include needing less runtime storage and the ability to correct errors in words that are not included in a dictionary. 

In some cases, spell checkers use a fixed list of misspellings and suggestions for those misspellings; this less flexible approach is often used in paper-based correction methods, such as the &quot;see also&quot; entries of encyclopedias.

Clustering algorithms have also been used for spell checking combined with phonetic information.

==History==
===Pre-PC===
In 1961, Les Earnest, who headed the research on this budding technology, saw it necessary to include the first spell checker that accessed a list of 10,000 acceptable words. Ralph Gorin, a graduate student under Earnest at the time, created the first true spelling checker program written as an applications program (rather than research) for general English text: SPELL for the DEC PDP-10 at Stanford University&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, in February 1971. Gorin wrote SPELL in assembly language, for faster action; he made the first spelling corrector by searching the word list for plausible correct spellings that differ by a single letter or adjacent letter transpositions and presenting them to the user. Gorin made SPELL publicly accessible, as was done with most SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) programs, and it soon spread around the world via the new ARPAnet, about ten years before personal computers came into general use. SPELL, its algorithms and data structures inspired the Unix &quot;ispell&quot; program.
The first spell checkers were widely available on mainframe computers in the late 1970s. A group of six linguists from Georgetown University developed the first spell-check system for the IBM corporation.

Henry Kučera invented one for the VAX machines of Digital Equipment Corp in 1981.

===Unix===

The International Ispell program commonly used in Unix is based on R. E. Gorin&#x27;s SPELL. It was converted to C by Pace Willisson at MIT.

The GNU project has its spell checker GNU Aspell. Aspell&#x27;s main improvement is that it can more accurately suggest correct alternatives for misspelled English words.

Due to the inability of traditional spell checkers to check words in complex inflected languages, Hungarian László Németh developed Hunspell, a spell checker that supports agglutinative languages and complex compound words. Hunspell also uses Unicode in its dictionaries.
Hunspell replaced the previous MySpell in OpenOffice.org in version 2.0.2.

Enchant is another general spell checker, derived from AbiWord. Its goal is to combine programs supporting different languages such as Aspell, Hunspell, Nuspell, Hspell (Hebrew), Voikko (Finnish), Zemberek (Turkish) and AppleSpell under one interface.

===PCs===
The first spell checkers for personal computers appeared in 1980, such as &quot;WordCheck&quot; for Commodore systems which was released in late 1980 in time for advertisements to go to print in January 1981. Developers such as Maria Mariani and Random House rushed OEM packages or end-user products into the rapidly expanding software market. On the pre-Windows PCs, these spell checkers were standalone programs, many of which could be run in terminate-and-stay-resident mode from within word-processing packages on PCs with sufficient memory.

However, the market for standalone packages was short-lived, as by the mid-1980s developers of popular word-processing packages like WordStar and WordPerfect had incorporated spell checkers in their packages, mostly licensed from the above companies, who quickly expanded support from just English to many European and eventually even Asian languages. However, this required increasing sophistication in the morphology routines of the software, particularly with regard to heavily-agglutinative languages like Hungarian and Finnish. Although the size of the word-processing market in a country like Iceland might not have justified the investment of implementing a spell checker, companies like WordPerfect nonetheless strove to localize their software for as many national markets as possible as part of their global marketing strategy.

When Apple developed &quot;a system-wide spelling checker&quot; for Mac OS X so that &quot;the operating system took over spelling fixes,&quot; it was a first: one &quot;didn&#x27;t have to maintain a separate spelling checker for each&quot; program. Mac OS X&#x27;s spellcheck coverage includes virtually all bundled and third party applications.

&quot;Visual Tools&quot;&#x27; &quot;VT Speller&quot;, introduced in 1994, was &quot;designed for developers of applications that support Windows.&quot; It came with a dictionary but had the ability to build and incorporate use of secondary dictionaries.

===Browsers===
Web browsers such as Firefox and Google Chrome offer spell checking support, using Hunspell. Prior to using Hunspell, Firefox and Chrome used MySpell and GNU Aspell, respectively.

===Specialties===
Some spell checkers have separate support for medical dictionaries to help prevent medical errors.

== Functionality ==
The first spell checkers were &quot;verifiers&quot; instead of &quot;correctors.&quot; They offered no suggestions for incorrectly spelled words. This was helpful for typos but it was not so helpful for logical or phonetic errors. The challenge the developers faced was the difficulty in offering useful suggestions for misspelled words. This requires reducing words to a skeletal form and applying pattern-matching algorithms.

It might seem logical that where spell-checking dictionaries are concerned, &quot;the bigger, the better,&quot; so that correct words are not marked as incorrect. In practice, however, an optimal size for English appears to be around 90,000 entries. If there are more than this, incorrectly spelled words may be skipped because they are mistaken for others. For example, a linguist might determine on the basis of corpus linguistics that the word &quot;baht&quot; is more frequently a misspelling of &quot;bath&quot; or &quot;bat&quot; than a reference to the Thai currency. Hence, it would typically be more useful if a few people who write about Thai currency were slightly inconvenienced than if the spelling errors of the many more people who discuss baths were overlooked.

The first MS-DOS spell checkers were mostly used in proofing mode from within word processing packages. After preparing a document, a user scanned the text looking for misspellings. Later, however, batch processing was offered in such packages as Oracle&#x27;s short-lived CoAuthor and allowed a user to view the results after a document was processed and correct only the words that were known to be wrong. When memory and processing power became abundant, spell checking was performed in the background in an interactive way, such as has been the case with the Sector Software produced Spellbound program released in 1987 and Microsoft Word since Word 95.

Spell checkers became increasingly sophisticated; now capable of recognizing grammatical errors. However, even at their best, they rarely catch all the errors in a text (such as homophone errors) and will flag neologisms and foreign words as misspellings. Nonetheless, spell checkers can be considered as a type of foreign language writing aid that non-native language learners can rely on to detect and correct their misspellings in the target language.

== Spell-checking for languages other than English ==

English is unusual in that most words used in formal writing have a single spelling that can be found in a typical dictionary, with the exception of some jargon and modified words. In many languages, words are often concatenated into new combinations of words. In German, compound nouns are frequently coined from other existing nouns. Some scripts do not clearly separate one word from another, requiring word-splitting algorithms. Each of these presents unique challenges to non-English language spell checkers.

==Context-sensitive spell checkers==
There has been research on developing algorithms that are capable of recognizing a misspelled word, even if the word itself is in the vocabulary, based on the context of the surrounding words. Not only does this allow words such as those in the poem above to be caught, but it mitigates the detrimental effect of enlarging dictionaries, allowing more words to be recognized. For example, &quot;baht&quot; in the same paragraph as &quot;Thai&quot; or &quot;Thailand&quot; would not be recognized as a misspelling of &quot;bath&quot;. The most common example of errors caught by such a system are homophone errors, such as the bold words in the following sentence:
:Their coming too sea if its reel.

The most successful algorithm to date is Andrew Golding and Dan Roth&#x27;s &quot;Winnow-based spelling correction algorithm&quot;, published in 1999, which is able to recognize about 96% of context-sensitive spelling errors, in addition to ordinary non-word spelling errors. Context-sensitive spell checkers appeared in the now-defunct applications Microsoft Office 2007 and Google Wave.

Grammar checkers attempt to fix problems with grammar beyond spelling errors, including incorrect choice of words.

<doc id="605870" wikidata="Q2722903" url="?curid=605870" title="Inosculation">
<text>Inosculation is a natural phenomenon in which trunks, branches or roots of two trees grow together in a manner biologically similar to the artificial process of grafting. The term is derived from the Latin roots &quot;in&quot; + &quot;&quot;, &quot;to kiss into/inward/against&quot; or etymologically and more illustratively &quot;to make a small mouth inward/into/against&quot;; trees having undergone the process are referred to in forestry as gemels, from the Latin word meaning &quot;a pair&quot;.

It is most common for branches of two trees of the same species to grow together, though inosculation may be noted across related species. The branches first grow separately in proximity to each other until they touch. At this point, the bark on the touching surfaces is gradually abraded away as the trees move in the wind. Once the cambium of two trees touches, they sometimes self-graft and grow together as they expand in diameter. Inosculation customarily results when tree limbs are braided or pleached.

The term &quot;inosculation&quot; is also used in the context of plastic surgery, as one of the three mechanisms by which skin grafts take at the host site. Blood vessels from the recipient site are believed to connect with those of the graft in order to restore vascularity.

==Species==
Inosculation is most common among the following taxa due to their thin bark:

*Apple
*Almond
*Ash
*Beech
*Crepe myrtle
*Chestnut
*Dogwood
*Elm
*Ficus
*Grape
*Hazelnut
*Hornbeam
*Laburnum
*Linden
*Maple
*Norway spruce
*Olive
*Peach
*Pear
*Privet
*River red gum
*Sycamore
*Willow
*Wisteria
==Conjoined trees==
Two trees may grow to their mature size adjacent to each other and seemingly grow together or conjoin, demonstrating inosculation. These may be of the same species or even of different genera or families, depending on whether the two trees have become truly grafted together (once the cambium of two trees touches, they self-graft and grow together). Usually grafting is only between two trees of the same or closely related species or genera, but the appearance of grafting can be given by two trees that are physically touching, rubbing, intertwined, or entangled. Both conifers and deciduous trees can become conjoined. Beech trees in particular are frequent conjoiners, as is blackthorn (&quot;Prunus spinosa&quot;).
Such trees are often colloquially referred to as &quot;husband and wife&quot; trees, or &quot;marriage trees&quot;. The straightforward application of the term comes from the obvious unification of two separate individual trees, although a more humorous use of the term relates to the sexually suggestive appearance of some natural examples. There may be a degree of religious intent, as some cults are organized around beliefs that trees contain a hidden or sacred power to cure or to enhance fertility, or that they contain the souls of ancestors or of the unborn.

===Examples===
On his &quot;Tour of Scotland&quot;, published in 1800, T. Garnett notes a tree near Inveraray that the locals called the Marriage tree, formed from a lime tree with two trunks that have been joined by a branch in the manner of a person putting an arm around another (see illustration) as would a married couple.

On the way to the Heavenly Lake near Urumqi in China are a pair of trees that local people have called the Husband and Wife trees because they are connected by a living branch. The Tatajia Husband and Wife trees are in Taiwan and in Yakushima, Kagoshima-ken, Japan, are a pair of Husband and Wife trees formed from conjoined cedars.

In Lambeg, Co. Down, slightly north of Wolfenden&#x27;s Bridge, stand two beech trees (see &#x27;Gallery&#x27;) at the entrance to Chrome Hill, on the Lambeg to Ballyskeagh road. In the late 18th century, John Wesley was staying at Chrome Hill and decided to weave together two young beech trees to act as a symbol of unity between the Methodist Church and the Church of Ireland.

At Doonholm near Ayr an ancient sycamore maple (&quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;) was famous for the multiple fusion of its boughs that gave it a unique appearance and greatly strengthened it.

<doc id="605874" wikidata="Q6628341" url="?curid=605874" title="List of memoirs of political prisoners">
<text>A memoir is an autobiographical writing normally dealing with a particular subject from the author&#x27;s life. The following is a list of writers who have described their experiences of being political prisoners. Those included in the list are individuals who were imprisoned for activities ranging from peaceful dissent to violent revolutionary activity. Some were citizens of the countries whose regimes imprisoned them and others were foreign nationals. What connects them is that they have written about their experience of having been imprisoned because of their political opposition or political identity.

Note, too, that the list omits many autobiographies which deal, only in part, with a period of political imprisonment; and includes some in which imprisonment forms a major part of the book.

<text>A bondage hood (also called a [[Gimp (sadomasochism)|gimp]] mask or bondage mask) is a fetishistic hood. It may be made from rubber, latex, PVC, spandex, darlexx or leather. Full-faced hoods are typically used for the practice of head bondage, and to restrain and objectify the wearer through depersonalization, disorientation and/or sensory deprivation.

The use of bondage hoods can be hazardous if breathing is impeded.

Bondage hoods are frequently referenced in popular culture, most notably in the film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.

<doc id="605886" wikidata="Q1007201" url="?curid=605886" title="Gawler">
<text>Gawler is the oldest country town on the Australian mainland in the state of South Australia. It was named after the second Governor (British Vice-Regal representative) of the colony of South Australia, George Gawler. It is about north of the state capital, Adelaide, and is close to the major wine producing district of the Barossa Valley. Topographically, Gawler lies at the confluence of two tributaries of the Gawler River, the North and South Para rivers, where they emerge from a range of low hills.

Historically a semi-rural area, Gawler has been swept up in Adelaide&#x27;s growth in recent years, and is now considered by some as an outer northern suburb of Adelaide. It is counted as a suburb in the Outer Metro region of the Greater Adelaide Planning Region.

==History==

The Kaurna people are indigenous to the Adelaide Plains. A British colony, South Australia was established as a commercial venture by the South Australia Company through the sale of land to free settlers at £1 per acre (£2/9/5d or £2.47 per hectare). Gawler was established through a &quot;special survey&quot; applied for by Henry Dundas Murray and John Reid and a syndicate of ten other colonists.

The town plan was devised by the colonial surveyor William Light, and was the only town planned by him other than Adelaide. William Jacob used Light&#x27;s plans and laid out the town.

Adelaide became a model of foresight with wide streets and ample parklands. After Light&#x27;s death, it also became a model for numerous other planned towns in South Australia (many of which were never built). As the only other town planned by Light, Gawler is dissimilar to Adelaide&#x27;s one square mile (2.6 km²) grid; the heart of Gawler is triangular rather than square, a form dictated by the topographical features. The parkland along the riverbanks and a Victorian preference for public squares are present, but Light was aware that he was planning a village, not a metropolis.
Gawler prospered early with the discovery of copper nearby at Kapunda and Burra, which resulted in Gawler becoming a resting stop to and from Adelaide. Later, it developed industries including flour milling by Hilfers &amp; Co, and the engineering works of James Martin &amp; Co manufactured agricultural machinery, mining and ore-processing machinery and smelters for the mines of Broken Hill and the Western Australian goldfields, and steam locomotives and rolling stock. May Brothers &amp; Co. also manufactured mining and agricultural machinery.

With prosperity came a modest cultural flowering, (&quot;The colonial Athens&quot; was its nickname in the late 19th and early 20th centuries), the high point of which was the holding of a competition to compose an anthem for Australia in 1859, four decades before nationhood. The result was the Song Of Australia, written by Caroline Carleton to music by Carl Linger. This became, in the next century, a candidate in a national referendum to choose a new National Anthem for Australia to replace &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;.

Gawler had a horse street tram service from 1879 to 1931.

==Deadman&#x27;s Pass==
Boyle Travers Finniss recounts an incident during Colonial Light&#x27;s travels before the Gawler survey. While camping at the Gawler river, they stumbled upon a deceased man buried upright and coated in clay. The tale circulating in Adelaide attributes the man&#x27;s demise to a party led by Mr. Berhard. Allegedly, while travelling north with a dray, a distressed man emerged from the scrub west of the road and collapsed from hunger and thirst near the Gawler river ford. Despite efforts to save him, he succumbed shortly after encountering the party. They interred him in a tree and covered him in clay to protect his body from wild dogs, dubbing the tree &quot;dead man&#x27;s tree.&quot; The site, known as deadman&#x27;s pass, lies at the southern end of Murray Street near the river.

==Culture==
Gawler is a commercial centre for the Mid-North districts of South Australia.

Gawler regularly hosts stages of the annual cycling race, the Tour Down Under.

The annual show, named the Gawler Show, was established in 1856 and is South Australia&#x27;s largest country show. Show attendances regularly attract an estimated 30,000 people over the weekend. The Gawler Show has won the Gawler Australia Day Award for Community Event of the Year in 2010 and 2017.

The Gawler Police XI (The Gawler Police are one of the oldest stations in Australia, as they have been on Cowan Street, Gawler continuously since 1842 ) play against a Salvation Army All-Stars team made up of local civic and business leaders in an annual community charity cricket match for the Hope Cup The 2022 Hope Cup match raised more than $40,000 to assist the homeless population in the community. The match is played at Curdnatta Park (Sandy Creek) which is considered one of the most picturesque cricket grounds in all of South Australia. The Bunyip Newspaper (The oldest regional newspaper in South Australia), awards the Bunyip Medal to the player in the game who best displays the spirit of the Hope Cup on and off the field. The Hope Cup Cricket Match won the Gawler Australia Day Award for Community Event of the Year in 2023 Australian cricket legend Darren Lehmann launched the 2nd Hope Cup at a formal dinner in August 2023 The Gawler Police XI won the Hope Cup in 2022 and retained it in 2023 The 2024 Hope Cup was launched by International Stars, Darcie Brown and Henry Olonga in June 2024 The All-Stars won in November 2024 with Federal Member for Spence Matt Burnell MP as part of the team the Cup was presented after the game by 2024 AFL Sir Douglas Nicholls Honoree Sonny Morey. 
==Transport==

Gawler is just over forty kilometres north of Adelaide city centre along Main North Road. Main North Road was the historic road to the Mid North region of South Australia. North of Gawler, the road is now known as the Horrocks Highway. The Sturt Highway runs northeast from the north side of Gawler, leading to Nuriootpa, the Riverland, Mildura and Sydney. The Barossa Valley Way runs east from the centre of Gawler into the Barossa Valley, and was the original route of the Sturt Highway. The Thiele Highway leads north between the Horrocks and Sturt Highways to Freeling, Kapunda and Morgan. The Northern Expressway is a new highway to the southwest providing a bypass of Gawler as part of the North–South Corridor, Adelaide which will eventually provide a non-stop road from south of Adelaide to Nuriootpa.

Gawler railway station was the terminus of the railway from Adelaide from 1857. The railway was extended to Kapunda in 1860. Gawler became a junction station when a branch was constructed into the Barossa Valley in 1911. This is the line that provides the Gawler Oval and Gawler Central (originally named North Gawler) railway stations in Gawler. Neither lines are now used beyond Gawler and Gawler Central is now the terminus of the metropolitan rail services from Adelaide.
Gawler&#x27;s horse-drawn tram service opened in 1879. It operated for both goods and passengers from the railway station along what is now Nineteenth Street (then known as part of Murray Street) and Murray Street (the town&#x27;s main street) to a terminus near where the Gawler Central station is now. It passed the James Martin &amp; Co engineering factory, providing a convenient way to deliver heavy equipment such as locomotives manufactured there. Broad gauge locomotives were taken directly on the tramway, narrow gauge were transported on specially-built flat-bed trucks. There were also sidings at May Brothers and Company, Roedigers, and Dowson&#x27;s Mill. The tram closed in 1931 replaced by a bus, and the tracks lifted soon after.

The tram route is now part of Adelaide Metro bus route number 491.

==Sport==
The Gawler Greyhound Racing Club hold greyhound racing meetings at the Showgrounds on Nixon Terrace. The Club held its first meeting on 12 July 1971.

<text>The St. Enoch Centre is a shopping mall located in the city centre of Glasgow, Scotland. The centre is located adjacent to St Enoch Square. The Architects were the GMW Architects. The construction, undertaken by Sir Robert McAlpine, began in 1986, and the building was opened to the public on 25 May 1989. It was officially opened by the then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in February of the following year.

Located on the site of the former St Enoch Station, the building is just off Glasgow&#x27;s famous shopping thoroughfare, Argyle Street and overlooks the historic St. Enoch Square and the original subway station building. The present St Enoch subway station is accessible by escalators.

Whilst the target of many architectural critics, the building is notable for its massive glass roof, which makes it the largest glass-covered enclosed area in Europe. Not only does this substantially reduce heating and lighting loads – the mall area is lit entirely by natural daylight in summer, whilst the solar heat generated by the roof means that mechanical heating is only required for a week on average per year – it also earned the building its affectionate nickname &quot;The Glasgow Greenhouse&quot;. The roof&#x27;s steel framework was fabricated by the shipbuilders Scott Lithgow.

The glass roofed element surrounds a seven-storey car park, and when originally opened, an ice rink. This was closed in 1999 when a refurbishment programme (initiated to compete with the newer Buchanan Galleries complex), saw it being replaced by more shops and an enlarged restaurant area.

==Shopping==
Since its opening, St Enoch&#x27;s anchor tenants were British Home Stores on the eastern end of the complex, and Boots on the western end adjacent to St Enoch square. Although not part of the mall, there is a link bridge over Osbourne Street to the Debenhams department store on the north side of the building – this was originally the historic Lewis&#x27;s store on Argyle Street which itself had undergone a major renovation prior to St Enoch&#x27;s opening.

==Gallery==
==Refurbishment==

===2000–2001===

The mall has undergone two major refurbishments. Between 2000 and 2001 the ice rink was closed, and converted into an extended food court, and the second floor above the food court area was converted into an entertainment stage. The Argyle Street exit was demolished and rebuilt with an extended mezzanine level housing a TK Maxx store (now closed), and additional shop units with new escalators to serve them. There were other minor updates - the balustrades and handrails were replaced, and the spiral staircase in the centre of the main mall was removed, whilst the hanging wall gardens on the car park exterior walls were replaced by projection screens.

===2008–2016===
In 2008, a £100 million refurbishment began that was expected to be complete by the end of 2009, but was eventually completed in mid-2010. This refurbishment expanded the floor area to and it added a new entrance at the corner of Argyle Street and Buchanan Street, whilst the Argyle Street entrance built in 2000 was demolished for a second time to make way for a new facade, resulting in the closure of the TK Maxx store. In line with the extensions, the original 1980s floor tiling was replaced and the escalators at both ends of the main mall were moved to different locations and renewed.

Hamleys, G-Star RAW, H&amp;M, Schuh Kids and Starbucks are some of the few new retail units as part of the refurbishment. Initially, the shopping centre is aiming to tender to a more upmarket niche to compete well with the high street and rival mall Buchanan Galleries. The Tesco Metro store formerly on Argyle Street relocated to the lower ground level of the extension, whilst the TK Maxx store that was displaced from the mall relocated to the vacant Tesco site.

St Enoch&#x27;s Square is also being redeveloped in order to encourage a better public communication. The units overlooking the square will be occupied by food outlets to encourage a new civic space for Glasgow on the square and encourage the public to be able to use the space easily.

In 2010, the Debenhams department store announced that they would be undergoing a renovation as part of the centre&#x27;s development, including a premier restaurant. This store has since closed.

===2016 onwards===

In 2016, it was confirmed that the former BHS store site would be redeveloped to introduce a multiscreen cinema, alongside new restaurants and retail stores. Work on the redevelopment began in April 2019, and was completed in 2022.

==Demolition==

On 30 May 2023, Glasgow City Council passed planning permission to demolish the St Enoch Centre. It is to be replaced with a development including shops, offices, restaurants and homes. The proposed development sees the introduction of new streets into the precinct, with a newly formed St Enoch Street to the south and an extended Maxwell Street to the east. Demolition of the existing centre will take place in phases over an expected timeframe of 15 to 20 years, aimed at allowing retailers, restaurants and leisure operators to stay open throughout.

<doc id="605891" wikidata="Q1753009" url="?curid=605891" title="David Bowie (1967 album)">
<text>David Bowie is the debut studio album by the English musician David Bowie, originally released in the United Kingdom on 1 June 1967 through Decca subsidiary Deram Records. Produced by Mike Vernon and recorded from November 1966 to March 1967 in London, the album followed a string of singles Bowie released for Pye Records that failed to chart. Vernon hired numerous studio musicians for the album&#x27;s sessions; Bowie and his former Buzz bandmate Derek Fearnley composed music charts themselves using a musical guidebook.

The album displays a baroque pop and music hall sound influenced by Anthony Newley and the Edwardian styles of contemporary British rock bands. The songs are primarily led by orchestral brass and woodwind instruments rather than traditional instruments in pop music at the time, although some tracks feature guitar. The lyrical content varies from lighthearted childhood innocence to drug use and totalitarianism, themes that Bowie would return to in later works. The cover artwork is a headshot of Bowie with a mod haircut wearing a high-collared jacket.

Released in both mono and stereo mixes, &quot;David Bowie&quot; received positive reviews from music journalists but was a commercial failure due to a lack of promotion from Deram. Two tracks were omitted for its release in the United States in August 1967. Following its release, Bowie provided more tracks for Deram, all of which were rejected and led to his departure from the label. Retrospective reviews unfavourably compare &quot;David Bowie&quot; to Bowie&#x27;s later works, but some recognise it positively on its own terms. The album was reissued in a two-disc deluxe edition in 2010, featuring both mixes and other tracks from the period.

== Background ==
David Bowie was let go from Pye Records in September 1966 following a string of singles that failed to chart. A lack of promotion from Pye also contributed to his disenchantment with the label. In order to secure him a new record contract, his soon-to-be manager Kenneth Pitt financed a recording session at London&#x27;s RG Jones Recording Studios. On 18 October, Bowie and his backing band the Buzz conducted a four-hour session with a group of local studio musicians, producing a new version of the rejected Pye track &quot;The London Boys&quot; and two new songs, &quot;Rubber Band&quot; and &quot;The Gravedigger&quot;. 

Pitt showed acetates of the tracks to executives at Decca Records, who were impressed and signed Bowie to the label&#x27;s progressive pop subsidiary label Deram Records. His contract gave him a deal that financed the production of a full-length studio album and paid £150 for the three tracks and a further advance of £100 for royalties on the album. According to the biographer Nicholas Pegg, being granted an album deal before having a hit single was a rare occurrence at the time. Decca A&amp;R manager Hugh Mendl later said: &quot;I had a minor obsession about David—I just thought he was the most talented, magical person... I think I would have signed him even if he didn&#x27;t have such obvious musical talent. But he did have talent. He was bursting with creativity.&quot;

== Writing and recording ==

Bowie spent time before the album sessions writing songs, accumulating almost 30 new compositions. According to the author Paul Trynka, his songwriting focused less on traditional instrumentation and more in favour of orchestral arrangements, in the vein of the Beach Boys&#x27; recently-released &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. The sessions officially commenced on 14 November 1966 at Decca Studio 2 in West Hampstead, London with the recording of &quot;Uncle Arthur&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Got Medals&quot;. Decca in-house producer Mike Vernon handled production while Gus Dudgeon engineered. Bowie&#x27;s band the Buzz contributed with the exception of keyboardist Derek Boyes. 
Rather than hire an arranger, Bowie and Buzz member Derek &quot;Dek&quot; Fearnley used Freda Dinn&#x27;s &quot;Observer&#x27;s Guide to Music&quot;, a musical guidebook, to study orchestra arrangements and requested Vernon hire the appropriate musicians. Fearnley had little experience writing music charts, while Bowie could not read music at all, so Fearnley found it a daunting task, later stating: &quot;It was bloody hard work. I knew how to read the staves and that a bar had four crotches; David had never seen or written a note, so I was the one qualified to write stuff out.&quot; He found that when presenting the charts to the musicians, some of whom were members of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, they threw them back and requested new scores, which he had to do himself while Bowie monitored from the control room.

&quot;There Is a Happy Land&quot;, &quot;We Are Hungry Men&quot;, &quot;Join the Gang&quot; and the B-side &quot;Did You Ever Have a Dream&quot; were completed by 24 November. Around the same time, Pitt and Bowie&#x27;s current manager Ralph Horton decided that Bowie would cease live performances so he could focus on recording the album and that he would part ways with the Buzz. Bowie and the Buzz made their final live performance together on 2 December, the same day Deram issued the &quot;Rubber Band&quot; single. The sessions continued between 8 and 13 December with the recording of &quot;Sell Me a Coat&quot;, &quot;Little Bombardier&quot;, &quot;Silly Boy Blue&quot;, &quot;Maid of Bond Street&quot;, &quot;Come and Buy My Toys&quot; and &quot;The Gravedigger&quot;, now titled &quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger&quot;.

Besides the orchestra, Vernon hired several uncredited session musicians who were integral to the album&#x27;s sound; credited players included guitarist John Renbourn, whose playing is heard prominently on &quot;Come and Buy My Toys&quot;, and multi-instrumentalist Big Jim Sullivan, who contributed banjo and sitar on &quot;Did You Ever Have a Dream&quot; and &quot;Join the Gang&quot;, respectively. Fearnley&#x27;s friend Marion Constable also contributed backing vocals to &quot;Silly Boy Blue&quot;. Vernon recalled having &quot;a lot of fun&quot; during the sessions and described Bowie as &quot;the easiest person to work with&quot;, further adding that &quot;some of the melodies were extremely good, and the actual material, the lyrics, had a quality that was quite unique&quot;. Dudgeon also found the material unique, telling the biographer David Buckley that &quot;the music was very filmic, all very visual and all quite honest and unaffected&quot;.

A provisional running order was drawn up at the end of December 1966, which included tracks that were absent from the final album, such as &quot;Did You Ever Have a Dream&quot;, &quot;Your Funny Smile&quot; and &quot;Bunny Thing&quot;. In mid-January 1967, Bowie fired Horton as his manager after months of financial mismanagement and hired Pitt in his place. Bowie and the musicians reconvened at Decca on 26 January, recording the backing tracks for &quot;The Laughing Gnome&quot; and &quot;The Gospel According to Tony Day&quot;, which were chosen as the next single; vocals were added in early February. A new version of &quot;Rubber Band&quot; was recorded for inclusion on the album on 25 February, as well as &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot; and &quot;When I Live My Dream&quot;. These tracks featured uncredited arrangements by Arthur Greenslade. The sessions completed on 1 March. 

&quot;David Bowie&quot; was mixed in both mono and stereo, making it one of the first albums to be released in both formats. According to Pegg, the two variants featured minor differences in instrumentation and mixing: mono editions used slightly different mixes of &quot;Uncle Arthur&quot; and &quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger&quot;.

== Styles and themes ==

&quot;David Bowie&quot; consists of 14 tracks, all written entirely by Bowie. His influences at this time included Anthony Newley, music hall acts like Tommy Steele, British-centred material by Ray Davies of the Kinks, Syd Barrett&#x27;s psychedelic nursery rhymes for early Pink Floyd and the Edwardian flair shared by the contemporary works of the Kinks and the Beatles. Pitt&#x27;s desire for Bowie to become an &quot;all-around entertainer&quot; rather than a &quot;rock star&quot; also impacted the songwriter&#x27;s style. According to the author James E. Perone, the songs include styles of up-tempo pop, rock and waltz; BBC Music retrospectively categorised &quot;David Bowie&quot; as baroque pop and music hall. Rather than using traditional instruments in pop music at the time, such as guitar, piano, bass and drums, the instruments on &quot;David Bowie&quot; likened to those in music hall and classical music, such as brass instruments (tuba, trumpet and French horn) and woodwind instruments (bassoon, oboe, English horn and piccolo). Buckley notes almost a complete absence of lead guitar in the final mix.

Brass-led tracks include &quot;Rubber Band&quot;, &quot;Little Bombardier&quot; and &quot;Maid of Bond Street&quot;, woodwind-led tracks include &quot;Uncle Arthur&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Got Medals&quot;. &quot;Little Bombardier&quot; and &quot;Maid of Bond Street&quot; are in waltz time, while &quot;Join the Gang&quot; includes sitar and a musical quotation of the Spencer Davis Group&#x27;s recent hit &quot;Gimme Some Lovin&#x27;&quot;. Newley&#x27;s influence is present on &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Little Bombardier&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Got Medals&quot;. Regarding the influence, Newley himself stated in 1992: &quot;I always made fun of it, in a sense. Most of my records ended in a stupid giggle, trying to tell people that I wasn&#x27;t being serious. I think Bowie liked that irreverent thing, and his delivery was very similar to mine, that Cockney thing.&quot;
&quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot; and &quot;Come and Buy My Toys&quot; are among the few songs on the album with an acoustic guitar, the former heavily augmented by strings. The latter is noted by the biographer Chris O&#x27;Leary as more minimalist in nature, and exemplifies folk in a way the author Peter Doggett likens to Simon &amp; Garfunkel. &quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger&quot;, which Buckley described as &quot;one of pop&#x27;s genuinely crazy moments&quot;, utilises various studio sound effects and no backing instrumentation. Biographers compare it to a radio play from the 1940s and 1950s and consider it a comedic parody of the old British song &quot;Oh! Mr Porter&quot;.

Like the music, the lyrical themes on &quot;David Bowie&quot; are widespread, ranging from lighthearted, to dark, to funny to sarcastic. The characters range from societal outcasts, to losers, &quot;near-philosophers&quot; and dictators. According to O&#x27;Leary, &quot;David Bowie&quot; found Bowie composing third-person narratives compared to the first-person love stories of his previous releases, a statement echoed by Kevin Cann, who likens the song narratives to traditional folk stories. In 1976, Bowie commented that &quot;the idea of writing sort of short stories, I thought was quite novel at the time&quot;. Marc Spitz writes that &quot;David Bowie&quot; contains several &quot;vaguely dark, arcane English story songs&quot; (&quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger&quot;, &quot;Uncle Arthur&quot;, &quot;Maid on Bond Street&quot;) that Pitt envisioned Bowie performing in lounges. &quot;Rubber Band&quot;, &quot;Little Bombardier&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Got Medals&quot; all evoke the Edwardian theme.

Lighthearted themes, such as childhood innocence, are celebrated in &quot;Sell Me a Coat&quot;, &quot;When I Live My Dream&quot; and &quot;Come and Buy My Toys&quot;, as well as the psychedelic-influenced &quot;There Is a Happy Land&quot;, which took its title and subject matter from the Andrew Young hymn of the same name. &quot;Silly Boy Blue&quot; expresses Bowie&#x27;s then-recent interest in Buddhism. Darker ideals such as peer pressure and drug use are discussed in &quot;Join the Gang&quot;, while &quot;We Are Hungry Men&quot; depicts a totalitarian world that reflects messianic worship and cannibalism in a comedic way. &quot;Little Bombardier&quot; concerns a war veteran who is forced to leave town after being suspected for pedophilia, and the a cappella &quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger&quot; details a child-murderer contemplating his next victim while standing in a graveyard.

== Release ==

&quot;David Bowie&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 1 June 1967, with the catalogue numbers DML 1007 (mono) and SML 1007 (stereo). Its release coincided with the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The American release, issued in August 1967, omitted &quot;We Are Hungry Men&quot; and &quot;Maid of Bond Street&quot;, which Pegg speculates was possibly due to the US practice of trimming track listings in order to &quot;reduce publishing royalties&quot;.

The sleeve photograph is a full-headshot of Bowie in a mod haircut wearing a high-collared jacket. The sleeve was taken by Fearnley&#x27;s brother Gerald in his basement studio near Marble Arch, where Bowie and Dek Fearnley had conducted rehearsals for the sessions. Bowie himself chose the jacket and later recalled that he was &quot;very proud&quot; of it, quipping that &quot;it was actually tailored&quot;. Spitz considers the image &quot;very rooted&quot; in the mid-1960s, while &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; Blake Goble called it &quot;perhaps the most uninteresting and dated album cover of Bowie&#x27;s career&quot; in 2018. Pitt&#x27;s sleeve notes described Bowie&#x27;s vision as &quot;straight and sharp as a laser beam. It cuts through hypocrisy, prejudice and cant. It sees the bitterness of humanity, but rarely bitterly. It sees the humour in our failings, the pathos of our virtues.&quot; 

Despite promotional attempts by other countries outside the UK and US, &quot;David Bowie&quot; was a commercial failure, in part due to lack of promotion from Deram; the label were unimpressed with the &quot;Rubber Band&quot; single and one of the executives who was instrumental in Bowie&#x27;s signing departed the company in May 1967, leaving little confidence in Bowie. Vernon later felt that Decca &quot;didn&#x27;t understand what rock music was... at all&quot;. Bowie&#x27;s other Deram singles &quot;The Laughing Gnome&quot; and a remake of &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot;, issued in April and July, respectively, both failed to chart, further signalling his downturn with the label.

===Reception===
&quot;David Bowie&quot; received few, albeit positive, reviews from music critics on release. In the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, Allen Evans praised the record as &quot;all very refreshing&quot; and called the artist &quot;a very promising talent&quot;, with &quot;a fresh sound to [Bowie and Fearnley&#x27;s] light musical arrangements&quot;. Chris Welch of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; enjoyed the album as &quot;a singularly rewarding collection&quot; featuring &quot;excellent&quot; production. Welch was surprised Bowie had yet to impact the pop scene. A reviewer for &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; described the album as &quot;a remarkable, creative debut album by a 19-year-old Londoner&quot;, declaring: &quot;Here is a new talent that deserves attention, for though David Bowie has no great voice, he can project words with a cheeky &#x27;side&#x27; that is endearing yet not precious... full of abstract fascination. Try David Bowie. He&#x27;s something new.&quot; The journalist also suggested that Bowie could garner more attention if he &quot;gets the breaker and the right singles&quot;. Pitt sent copies of &quot;David Bowie&quot; to music executives in order to generate publicity, receiving letters of admiration from Lionel Bart, Bryan Forbes and Franco Zeffirelli.

==Subsequent events==
After the album&#x27;s failure, Bowie recorded several more tracks for Deram from late 1967 to early 1968 as potential singles, all of which were rejected. Departing from the sound of &quot;David Bowie&quot;, these included &quot;Let Me Sleep Beside You&quot;, &quot;Karma Man&quot;, a new version of &quot;When I Live My Dream&quot;, &quot;In the Heat of the Morning&quot; and a remake of &quot;London Bye Ta–Ta&quot;. The failure of &quot;David Bowie&quot;, its singles and failed follow-up attempts led to Bowie&#x27;s departure from Deram in May 1968. Outside of music, he acted in mime actor Lindsay Kemp&#x27;s play &quot;Pierrot in Turquoise&quot; throughout early 1968, performing the &quot;David Bowie&quot; songs &quot;When I Live My Dream&quot;, &quot;Sell Me a Coat&quot; and &quot;Come and Buy My Toys&quot;.

The commercial failure of &quot;David Bowie&quot; led Pitt to authorize a promotional film in an attempt to introduce Bowie to a larger audience. The film, &quot;Love You till Tuesday&quot;, went unreleased until 1984. Bowie wrote a new song for the film, &quot;Space Oddity&quot;, a tale about a fictional astronaut. Produced by Dudgeon and released as a single in July 1969 for Mercury affiliate Philips Records, &quot;Space Oddity&quot; became the artist&#x27;s first hit, 18 months after &quot;David Bowie&quot; release.

==Legacy==

&quot;David Bowie&quot;, and the Deram period in general, were routinely mocked throughout Bowie&#x27;s career, being dismissed, in Pegg&#x27;s words, as &quot;music-hall piffle derived from a passing Anthony Newley fad&quot;. Dudgeon later acknowledged the similarities to Newley, saying that it &quot;bothered&quot; him and Vernon because they felt Bowie was &quot;really good and his songs are fucking great&quot;. Bowie himself downplayed or disowned the period entirely in later decades, dismissing it as &quot;cringey&quot; in 1990. According to Pegg, Bowie&#x27;s fans have attempted to place blame on Pitt for the record&#x27;s sound, despite Pitt being absent from Bowie&#x27;s person during the majority of the writing and recording period. The manager himself dismissed the theory in his memoir, stating that it was Bowie&#x27;s sole idea to mimic Newley.

Other claims made about &quot;David Bowie&quot; include the argument that it sounded like nothing else at the time, which is mostly attributed to Dudgeon&#x27;s &quot;oft-quoted&quot; description of the album as &quot;about the weirdest thing any record company have ever put out&quot;. Pegg debunks this idea, writing that the record&#x27;s blend of &quot;folk and short-story narrative&quot; shared similarities with the more commercial releases of the British psychedelia movement of 1966–1967, while the motifs of wartime nostalgia and childhood innocence reflected the contemporary ideals of Syd Barrett&#x27;s Pink Floyd, the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and the Beatles. The Beatles, in particular, embellished similar ideas as &quot;David Bowie&quot; into their recent records &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966) and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;: the latter&#x27;s &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; matched the waltz-style of &quot;Little Bombardier&quot;, while Pegg compares the styles of &quot;Uncle Arthur&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Got Medals&quot; and &quot;Sell Me a Coat&quot; to &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;. Buckley writes that Bowie&#x27;s use of brass and woodwinds on &quot;Rubber Band&quot; predated their use by the Beatles on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, while Doggett argues that &quot;Rubber Band&quot; and &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; both feature lyrical gags about performing &quot;out of tune&quot;. Regarding the blend of folk, pop and classical, Perone argues that the Moody Blues&#x27; &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, also released by Deram in 1967, was more commercially viable but displayed the combination on &quot;David Bowie&quot;, particularly on &quot;Rubber Band&quot; and &quot;Sell Me a Coat&quot;. Bowie also utilized the same sound effects as the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band&#x27;s debut single &quot;My Brother Makes the Noises for the Talkies&quot; for &quot;David Bowie&quot; &quot;We Are Hungry Men&quot;, &quot;Please Mr. Gravedigger&quot; and the outtake &quot;Toy Soldier&quot;.

Commentators have recognised themes on &quot;David Bowie&quot; that informed the artist&#x27;s later works, such as the self-styled messiah of &quot;We Are Hungry Men&quot;. Perone argues that the track anticipated the post-punk and new wave styles of the late 1970s, naming Talking Heads&#x27; first and second albums. The folk of &quot;Come and Buy My Toys&quot; also anticipated Bowie&#x27;s exploration of the genre on his 1969 second self-titled album, while Doggett finds the sense of desperation on &quot;Rubber Band&quot; foreshadowed the &quot;Station to Station&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; LPs of 1976 and 1977, respectively. Others found the gender-bending themes of &quot;She&#x27;s Got Medals&quot; foreshadowed 1971&#x27;s &quot;Queen Bitch&quot; and 1974&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;.

===Later reviews===
Retrospective reviews of &quot;David Bowie&quot; have unfavourably compared the LP with the artist&#x27;s later works, although some have recognised it positively in its own terms. Pegg summarises: &quot;David Bowie&quot; justifiably resides in the shadow of [Bowie&#x27;s] later work, but those with open ears and open minds know it as a sweet, clever album that has borne decades of derision with consummate dignity.&quot;

Writing for AllMusic, Dave Thompson called the LP &quot;an intriguing collection, as much in its own right as for the light it sheds on Bowie&#x27;s future career&quot; and concluded that &quot;though this material has been repackaged with such mind-numbing frequency as to seem all but irrelevant today, &quot;David Bowie&quot; still remains a remarkable piece of work. And it sounds less like anything else he&#x27;s ever done than any subsequent record in his catalog&quot;. The same publication&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine saw it as &quot;a fascinating, highly enjoyable debut&quot; on its own merits. Reviewing in 2010, BBC Music&#x27;s Sean Egan found an &quot;unrefined&quot; talent in Bowie, noting &quot;above average&quot; lyrics that are &quot;hardly deep&quot;. Nevertheless, he praised Bowie&#x27;s commitment to the project, concluding that &quot;&quot;David Bowie&quot; is hardly an essential listen but historically interesting as unmistakably the entrée of someone with a future.&quot; In 2017, Dave Swanson of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; found the music joyful, but felt the record was out of place with the music industry at the time, which mostly contributed to its failure.

Bowie&#x27;s biographers have held mixed opinions on &quot;David Bowie&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray said, &quot;a listener strictly accustomed to David Bowie in his assorted &#x27;70s guises would probably find this debut album either shocking or else simply quaint&quot;, while Buckley describes its status in Bowie&#x27;s discography as &quot;the vinyl equivalent of the madwoman in the attic&quot;, ridiculing it as a &quot;cringe-inducing piece of juvenilia&quot; only to be braved by &quot;those with a high enough embarrassment threshold&quot;. Perone felt the wide variety of musical styles were displayed &quot;generally to good effect&quot;. Trynka praises Bowie&#x27;s confidence and highlights individual tracks, such as &quot;We Are Hungry Men&quot; and &quot;Uncle Arthur&quot;, but notes that he lacked ambition and commerciality at the time. Doggett similarly contends that its &quot;whimsical character studies&quot; stood against the &quot;psychedelic ambiance&quot; of the era. 

In a 2016 list ranking Bowie&#x27;s studio albums from worst to best, Bryan Wawzenek of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed &quot;David Bowie&quot; at number 23 (out of 26), criticising Bowie&#x27;s vocal performances, lyrics and overall sound that lacks &quot;wit and energy&quot;. Including Bowie&#x27;s two albums with Tin Machine, the writers of &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; ranked &quot;David Bowie&quot; number 26 (out of 28) in their 2018 list. Goble called it &quot;an awkward artifact&quot;, representing signs of what was to come for the artist but as a standalone album, it remains &quot;not essential&quot;.

== Reissues and compilations ==

Bowie&#x27;s Deram recordings have been recycled in a multitude of compilation albums, including &quot;The World of David Bowie&quot; (1970), &quot;Images 1966–1967&quot; (1973), &quot;Another Face&quot; (1981), &quot;Rock Reflections&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Deram Anthology 1966–1968&quot; (1997).

Deram first reissued &quot;David Bowie&quot; on LP in August 1984, followed by a CD release in April 1989. In January 2010, Deram and Universal Music reissued the album in a remastered two-disc deluxe edition package. Containing 53 total tracks, the collection compiles both the original mono and stereo mixes, Bowie&#x27;s other Deram recordings, such as &quot;The London Boys&quot; and &quot;The Laughing Gnome&quot;, single mixes, previously unreleased stereo mixes, alternate takes and for the first time, Bowie&#x27;s first BBC radio session (&quot;Top Gear&quot;, December 1967). The tracks were remastered by Peter Mew and Tris Penna, who previously undertook Virgin&#x27;s deluxe reissue of &quot;David Bowie&quot; (1969). Penna stated in the deluxe edition liner notes that they wanted &quot;to ensure [the tracks] sounded as good, if not better, than when they were first released&quot;.

Reviewing the deluxe edition for &quot;The Second Disc&quot;, Joe Marchese considered it a welcome supplement to &quot;The Deram Anthology 1966–1968&quot; that showed Bowie had talent but lacked direction. He concluded that the set allows listeners to reexamine &quot;David Bowie&quot; and &quot;makes the best possible case for this &#x27;lost era&#x27; of Bowie history&quot;. Pegg similarly called the set &quot;excellent&quot;. Barry Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the collection as an &quot;early portrait of pop&#x27;s ultimate shape-shifter&quot;. Erlewine praised the addition of the new tracks, arguing that they enhance the debut rather than diminish it, fully offering more insight into Bowie&#x27;s talent at this stage of his career. More unfavourably, Egan felt the collection was &quot;comprehensive&quot; but &quot;aesthetically too much even if the parent album was the greatest ever made&quot;.

<text>Barry Louis Larkin (born April 28, 1964) is an American former professional baseball shortstop. As a player he spent his entire 19-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the Cincinnati Reds from 1986 to 2004.

He briefly played in the minor leagues before making his MLB debut in 1986. He quickly won the starting shortstop role for the Reds and enjoyed a long run of strong seasons with the team. Larkin struggled with a string of injuries between 1997 and 2003, limiting his playing time in several seasons.

Larkin retired after the 2004 season and worked in a front-office position for the Washington Nationals for several years until he joined ESPN as a baseball analyst. He served as a coach for the American team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and managed the Brazilian national team for the same event in 2013.

Larkin is considered one of the top players of his era, winning nine Silver Slugger awards, three Gold Glove awards, and the 1995 National League Most Valuable Player Award. He was selected to the Major League All-Star Game twelve times, and was one of the pivotal players on the 1990 Reds&#x27; World Series championship team. In 2012, Larkin was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life and education==
Born and raised in the Cincinnati suburb of Silverton, Ohio, and raised Catholic, Larkin attended Archbishop Moeller High School. Larkin accepted a football scholarship to the University of Michigan to play for coach Bo Schembechler, but during his freshman year, he decided to play baseball exclusively. He was a two-time All-American and led the Wolverines to berths in two College World Series, in 1983 and 1984 (the last time until 2019). Larkin was also named Big Ten Player of the Year in 1984 and 1985. Larkin&#x27;s number 16 was retired by the school on May 1, 2010. Baseball at the 1984 Summer Olympics saw Larkin playing for the United States team.

==Minor league career==
Barry Larkin played with the Vermont Reds on their team that won the 1985 Eastern League Championship and in 1986 was the Rookie of the Year and AAA Player of the Year with the Denver Zephyrs. In all, he played only 177 minor league games in his professional career.

==MLB career==
===Early career===

After arriving in the majors, Larkin battled fellow prospect Kurt Stillwell for the starting shortstop spot before establishing himself as the starter in 1987. In 1988, Larkin led all major leaguers by striking out only 24 times in 588 at-bats. Larkin batted .353 in the 1990 World Series to help lead the Reds to a four-game sweep of the Oakland Athletics. On June 27–28, 1991, Larkin became the first shortstop ever to hit five home runs in the span of two consecutive games. He earned his fourth consecutive All-Star Game selection that season.

After the 1991 season, Larkin questioned whether the Reds had a commitment to winning. He said he was likely to leave the team when his contract expired the next year, but he was encouraged when the Reds acquired pitchers Tim Belcher and Greg Swindell in the offseason. In January 1992, the Reds signed him to a five-year, $25.6 million contract. At that time, only four players had larger contracts and Larkin was the highest-paid shortstop. Larkin was not selected as an All-Star in 1992, but he won his fifth consecutive Silver Slugger Award. In 1993, he won the Roberto Clemente Award, which recognizes players who display sportsmanship, community service and on-field ability. In 1995, Larkin finished sixth in batting (.319) and second in stolen bases (51) to win the National League&#x27;s MVP award, the first by a shortstop since Maury Wills in 1962. He led the Reds to the National League Central division title and the 1995 National League Championship Series, where he batted .389 during the series loss to the eventual champion Atlanta Braves.

In 1996, Larkin hit a career-high 33 home runs and stole 36 bases, becoming the first shortstop in Major League history to join the 30–30 club. He arguably had a better season in 1996 than he had in his MVP year of 1995, as his on-base percentage and slugging percentage were both improved.

===Middle career===
Larkin was named the Reds&#x27; captain before the 1997 season, making him the first player to hold the honor since Dave Concepción&#x27;s retirement. Beginning that season, Larkin suffered a series of injuries throughout the last few years of his career. He missed 55 games that year due to injuries to his calf and his Achilles tendon. About three weeks before the opening of the 1998 season, Larkin decided to undergo neck surgery for a perforated disk. He was not in severe pain, but he was unable to lift his arm enough to play his defensive position.

On September 27, 1998, Barry, his brother Stephen Larkin, second baseman Bret Boone, and third baseman Aaron Boone all played the infield at the same time for the last game of the 1998 season, making it the first time in MLB history that an infield was composed entirely of two pairs of brothers. In 1999, Larkin was nearly traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He later said that he was approached by a Los Angeles clubhouse attendant, who gave him a Dodgers jersey with his name on it. The jersey had been prepared as trade negotiations advanced so that the teams could be prepared for a trade-related press conference. Also in 1999, Larkin served as a pre-game analyst for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the World Series alongside host Hannah Storm.

In July 2000, Larkin blocked a trade to the New York Mets to remain with the Reds. The trade would have sent three players — top minor league outfielder Alex Escobar, pitcher Eric Cammack and pitcher Jason Saenz — from the Mets to the Reds in exchange for Larkin. Larkin said that he would have gone to New York, as he enjoyed playing there, but the Mets did not want to sign him to a multi-year contract. The Reds signed him to a three-year contract extension worth $27 million. In the 2000 season, Larkin missed 59 games after he injured his finger twice and he suffered a knee sprain. He underwent finger surgery in April and knee surgery in September.

===Later career===

Larkin struggled with a groin injury in 2001, prompting criticism of his play. Broadcaster Joe Nuxhall said on air that Larkin had &quot;lost it&quot;. By August, the injury had limited Larkin to 45 games. He underwent season-ending surgery for a hernia that had been diagnosed during an evaluation of the groin injury. During the 2002 season, Larkin played in 145 games but hit for the lowest batting average (.245) since his first full year in the major leagues. Though he did not miss many games, Larkin dealt with injuries to his rib cage, hamstring, shoulder, neck and toe.

In 2003, Larkin had spent two stints on the disabled list with calf injuries by late May. During strained contract negotiations with Reds COO John Allen in late 2003, Larkin almost left the team. Larkin and the Reds agreed to a one-year contract for 2004. Larkin called off a planned retirement ceremony scheduled for October 2, 2004, because he was not sure if he would retire. In that season, Larkin hit for a .289 batting average. He announced his retirement in February 2005.

Commenting on Larkin&#x27;s retirement after such a strong season, sports columnist Terence Moore drew a comparison to the retirement of Ted Williams. He wrote, &quot;Barry Larkin wasn&#x27;t quite Williams at the end, but he was in the vicinity when it comes to the big picture... After years of injuries, he showed what a healthy Larkin still could do, but he also showed that he preferred to leave the game more like Williams than just about anybody else you can name in baseball history.&quot; In his 19-year career with Cincinnati, Larkin hit .295 with 2,340 hits, 198 home runs, 960 RBI, 1,329 runs scored and 379 stolen bases. Baseball historian and expert Bill James has called Larkin one of the greatest shortstops of all time, ranking him #6 all time in his &quot;New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;. Despite missing significant playing time in six seasons, Larkin won the Gold Glove Award three times (1994–1996) and was a 12-time All-Star (1988–1991, 1993–1997, 1999, 2000, and 2004). He became the first major league shortstop to join the 30–30 club when he had 33 home runs and 36 stolen bases in 1996.

==Post-retirement==

After his retirement, Larkin was hired as a special assistant to the general manager in the Washington Nationals organization. With the Nationals, he worked under former Reds general manager Jim Bowden. Larkin had hoped to work for the Reds, but &quot;USA Today&quot; reported that his 2003 contract disagreement with Allen eliminated that opportunity. In 2008, he signed with the MLB Network as a studio analyst.

He was the bench coach for the United States at the 2009 World Baseball Classic and managed the United States&#x27; second-round game against Puerto Rico when U.S. manager Davey Johnson left to attend his stepson&#x27;s wedding. On July 20, 2008, the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame and Museum inducted Larkin, César Gerónimo, August &quot;Garry&quot; Herrmann, and Joey Jay. The induction was held at the Duke Energy Center in downtown Cincinnati. On Tuesday, March 24, 2009, the College Baseball Foundation announced the names of the ten players and coaches comprising the 2009 National College Baseball Hall of Fame Induction Class, which included Barry Larkin.
In 2011, Larkin left Washington for ESPN to serve as a &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; analyst. Larkin received great applause from Reds fans when he helped host &quot;Baseball Tonight&#x27;s&quot; on-the-road coverage of Sunday Night Baseball at GABP on July 24, 2011. Crowd chants of &quot;Barry Larkin&quot; and &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; often caused the anchors to have to talk very loud to be heard. Larkin was coincidentally in Cincinnati for Baseball Tonight on the day of the 2011 Hall of Fame induction ceremonies.

In 2012, Larkin was voted into the Hall of Fame with 86.4% of the vote. He was the eighth Reds player and 24th shortstop inducted to the Hall of Fame. On August 25, 2012, his number 11 was retired in an official ceremony at Great American Ball Park. In 2010, his first year of eligibility for the Hall of Fame, Larkin had received 51.6% of the vote (75 percent is needed for election). In 2011, he received 62.1% of the vote, the highest of non-inducted players and third overall.

He was invited by the Brazilian Baseball Federation to manage their national team in the qualifiers for the 2013 World Baseball Classic. Brazil beat host country Panama in Brazil&#x27;s first time to qualify for the event. They were originally scheduled to play in Puerto Rico, but because of the huge Japanese baseball influence in Brazil, they played in Japan. The team played Cuba and China besides the home country.
 The team went winless in its WBC debut and was eliminated after the first round.

Larkin built the Champions Sports Complex to use sports in the social, emotional, and educational development of youth. In 2008, Larkin released a charity wine called &quot;Barry Larkin&#x27;s Merlot&quot;, with 100% of its proceeds supporting Champions Sports Foundation.

In November 2013, Detroit Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski confirmed that the organization had intended to interview Larkin for its open managerial position. Larkin declined the interview due to the time commitment associated with the job. Brad Ausmus was named the new Tigers manager on November 3, 2013.

In November 2014, the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; reported that Larkin was among 10 candidates interviewed for the Tampa Bay Rays&#x27; managerial job. Larkin was not among the team&#x27;s three finalists, and the job ultimately went to Kevin Cash.
Larkin joined the Cincinnati Reds as a minor-league roving infield instructor in May 2015. He helped out the big-league club during spring training 2016. When asked whether he hoped to manage in the future, he said, &quot;Never say never. The conditions have to be right and, you know, the manager&#x27;s job, at least in my opinion, is not about just having the manager&#x27;s position. It&#x27;s about having the support system to support that manager&#x27;s position.&quot;

On February 16, 2021, it was announced that Larkin joined the Reds&#x27; television broadcast team on Fox Sports Ohio.

On January 29, 2025, it was announced that Larkin would join the effort to bring Major League Baseball to Orlando, Florida as the MLB Ambassador for the Orlando Dreamers.

== Sports diplomacy ==
Larkin has also been an active participant in the SportsUnited Sports Envoy program for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, he has traveled to Colombia, Ecuador, India, Lithuania, Taiwan, where he worked with to conduct baseball clinics and events that reached more than 2,200 youth from underserved areas. In so doing, Larkin helped contribute to SportsUnited&#x27;s mission to reach out to youth populations in order to promote growth and a stable democratic government.

==Personal life==
Larkin&#x27;s brother, Stephen Larkin, was also a professional baseball player; he made it to the major leagues for one game with the Reds. Another brother, Byron Larkin, was a second-team All-American basketball player at Xavier University and is the color commentator on Xavier basketball radio broadcasts. Larkin&#x27;s eldest brother, Mike, was a captain of the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s football team in 1985. They were all raised Catholic.

Larkin and his wife Lisa have two daughters, Brielle D&#x27;Shea and Cymber, and a son, Shane. The family lives in Orlando, Florida. Shane played two seasons at the University of Miami before declaring himself eligible for the 2013 NBA draft. Shane was subsequently traded to the Dallas Mavericks and made his NBA debut in November 2013. Shane started as a guard for the Boston Celtics in 2017. 
Larkin&#x27;s daughters play lacrosse. Brielle D&#x27;Shea is named in honor of Shea Stadium, as Larkin enjoyed playing there.

<doc id="605896" wikidata="Q1350895" url="?curid=605896" title="Johan Sverdrup">
<text>Johan Sverdrup (30 July 1816 – 17 February 1892) was a Norwegian politician from the Liberal Party. He was the first prime minister of Norway after the introduction of parliamentarism. Sverdrup was prime minister from 1884 to 1889.

== Early years ==
He was born at Sem in Vestfold, Norway, to Jacob Liv Borch Sverdrup (1775–1841) and Gundelle Birgitte Siang (1780–1820). His father was a pioneer in scientific agriculture in Norway. He finished his law studies in 1841. He worked as a lawyer in Larvik, a small town on the west coast of the Oslofjord. In 1851, he was for the first time elected to the Storting, and from then until his appointment as prime minister in 1884, he was one of the leaders of parliament. In Norway, political parties were considered inappropriate and unwanted. Sverdrup tried from his earliest days in the Storting to form a radical party consisting of the large group of peasants and the radical elements among the representatives from the cities. His first attempt was named the &quot;lawyers&#x27; party&quot; after the profession of the leaders of the group. It soon became evident that the times were not ripe for such a radical novelty, and for the next years Sverdrup knit a loose alliance with the peasant leader Ole Gabriel Ueland (1799–1870).

== Forming the alliance ==
In 1870, Ueland died, and the loose leadership of the alliance of peasants went over to Søren Jaabæk (1814–1894), an economically extremely conservative politician, whose views hardly exceeded the most primitive cutting of every part of the budget, even if the money in question would be used to the furthering of democracy and education, two of his most important topics. Such negative policy-making (Jaabæk&#x27;s name was changed by the ministerial adherents and press to &quot;Neibæk&quot; after the Norwegian word &quot;nei&quot; &#x27;no&#x27; contrasting with &quot;ja&quot; &#x27;yes&#x27;) would never produce great results, which Sverdrup clearly foresaw. He did not hesitate to acknowledge Jaabæk as the formal leader and organizer of this budding party, based on the &quot;Bondevenforeninger&quot; (peasant friend associations) that Jaabæk managed to spread throughout most of the country. However, in parliament Jaabæk often bowed to Sverdrup&#x27;s more advanced political strategies, when they were not too expensive.

In 1869, a political reform of the greatest importance was introduced, yearly parliamentary sessions instead of the earlier triannual sessions. This definitely tipped the scale of political influence in favor of the Storting, and it is not easy to see the reasons for the King&#x27;s acceptance of this reform. The major reason was probably the growing necessity to get updated budgets, which was naturally the Storting&#x27;s task to provide.

During the 1860s, the views towards the ministers&#x27; participation in the parliamentary sessions had changed totally. The ministerials, as they were called, were now unanimously against, because they had seen the formation of the peasants&#x27; friends as a threat to what they deemed to be the ideal, the totally independent representative. The peasants and the radicals on the other hand, had drawn the obviously correct conclusion that this reform would further the influence of the elected towards the appointed ministers.

In 1870, the Storting passed a change in the constitution which granted the ministers admission to Parliament when asked, but the King refused to sanction the law, stating that it was premature so few years after the yearly sessions reform. In 1872 the new king, Oscar II, decided that Norway, in its precarious situation with the Council mostly convening in the capital, Christiania (now Oslo), while the king mostly lived in Sweden&#x27;s capital Stockholm needed two prime ministers, one in each capital. Until then there had only been one in Stockholm, because the Council in Christiania was supposed to be led by an appointed governor, a position which had been vacant for 15 years because no Swedish king had dared or wished to appoint a new governor.

This made an extremely minor change in the suggested change in the constitution, when it was passed in 1873, necessary, namely that there were now two prime ministers, while there was only one in the previous law text. The changed constitution was not sanctioned this time either. The same happened in 1876 and 1879, and now a major problem had occurred, which made Norwegian politics extremely difficult for several years. The Constitution explicitly stated that the king had a veto three times in law and budget matters, but there was no mention of any kind of veto concerning constitutional matters.

This omission gave way to three possibilities:

# The king had no veto at all
# The king had an absolute veto
# The king had the same veto rights as in all other matters

The opposition which made up a vast majority, had practically rejected the first possibility and decided upon the third, whereas the Council and the minority of the Storting was certain of the king&#x27;s absolute veto.

== The strife hardens ==
The strife which had started as a practical political reform had now turned into a political debacle which would have to change the checks and balances between the legislative and the executive branch. This had definitely become Sverdrup&#x27;s goal. &quot;All power must be gathered in the halls of the Storting&quot; became his political program. In 1879 his party in the making made a coup by promulgating the new change in the constitution. This took the Council by surprise that the grand old man of the Council, Prime Minister Frederik Stang, resigned. The new prime minister, Christian Selmer, was not such a leader and force in the Council, and Sverdrup was ready for the next move, which should constitutionally have been taken in 1881. But Sverdrup&#x27;s majority was not great enough to be certain of a victory in the forthcoming impeachment of the Council.

In the 1882 general elections Sverdrup&#x27;s party won a convincing majority. They were able to fill the 25% of the Storting who were, together with the Supreme Court, the judges of the court, with only members of the leftist party in formation. 
Venstre (from the Norwegian word for left) was Sverdrup&#x27;s and Jaabæk&#x27;s liberal and radical party but definitely a party with no socialist affiliations.
Høyre (from the Norwegian word for &#x27;right&#x27;) was the Council&#x27;s and the minority party which was considered to be conservative.


In the fall 1883, the judges convened and the trials took several months and resulted in loss of position without honor for most of the ministers and huge fines. The king appointed a new Council led by Christian Schweigaard, but was a rather lame move, since Sverdrup immediately threatened with a new impeachment trial. The new Council was named the April Ministry, which says something about how long the king&#x27;s struggle to find a solution to the total crisis that had occurred, which he could deem acceptable.

It turned out there was no other choice than to appoint Johan Sverdrup as prime minister. In Norwegian tradition the transition from Montesquieu&#x27;s ideal of checks and balances to a parliamentary system took place when he became the prime minister. There is evidence that Sverdrup himself never really understood the consequences of a parliamentary system. Hence his five years in power with a vast majority in support, was no triumph march, but a row of defeats in Parliament. It is not far from a personal tragedy, and his resignation in 1889 was the only possible finale to a rather unworthy drama that took place within the Venstre.

== Sverdrup&#x27;s government ==
It turned out from the first day that Sverdrup as a prime minister was not the competent strategist that most Norwegians had either learned to fear or admire. He expected his adherents to follow him as they had done for almost 30 years. It also turns out that Venstre was a more loosely knit coalition than Sverdrup and the other leaders had expected. The fight against the powerful executive branch had created alliances that broke very quickly afterwards. Sverdrup and all his ministers belonged to the conservative faction of the party. They had strong support what the leading Norwegian sociologist, Stein Rokkan, labeled the periphery, adherents of lay Christianity in opposition to the clergy, adherents of the so-called New Norwegian in opposition to the Norwegian spoken in the cities, adherents of totalitarianism.

His great mistake was to refuse to include anyone from the radical faction and to further alienate them by not accepting their advice in any of the difficult political situations that arose in those years. In the 1885 general election the party&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Have confidence in Johan Sverdrup&quot; which later has been deemed one of the most ridiculous slogans ever created. A party without ability to find anything to unite about will have no long life, and the breach in the party became evident throughout the three years before the next general elections.

Sverdrup and his colleagues and diminishing group in the Storting were more or less expelled from the party and had to start their own Venstre. The original party, now led by Sverdrup&#x27;s leading opponents, Ullmann and Steen, voted against him and mocked the elder statesman for clinging to the &quot;Chair&quot;, but he was saved by Høyre which had no intentions to diminish the strife within the Venstre, and believed that their best hope was to leave the Sverdrup ministry in peace until the general elections in 1888. After those elections, which proved fully that Høyre strategy had been a sound one, Sverdrup&#x27;s ministry was quickly ousted.

== Father of Parliamentarism ==
The views towards this controversial political leader will differ greatly with the political and historical affiliation of those expressing a view. It can not be denied that Sverdrup was an extremely skilled and able opposition leader and strategist whose influence of domestic politics was enormous for about 30 years. What can be said against such a viewpoint, is that most of the results of his opposition was destructive because he sold his radical and social liberal political views in order to gain influence in Jaabæk&#x27;s loosely knit alliance of peasants. On the other hand one tends to forget that there was a class struggle between the peasants and the public servant and tradesmen classes, which in Norway with no nobility, were the most influential, and that Sverdrup, a public servant, joined the vast and less influential group of peasants in order to transform the society.

His weakness was his inability to bury hatchets and his apparent lack of flexibility in older age. His inability to understand the concept of parliamentarism, which seemed to be the ultimate goal of his policies. His clinging to the symbols of power can be ascribed to his age, but he was only about 70. Most historians would conclude that his fight against the king&#x27;s appointed Council lasted too long. He was too old to harvest the fruits, but he paved the way for a new political situation in Norway.

<text>Niall John Quinn (honorary MBE; born 6 October 1966) is an Irish former professional footballer, manager, businessman and sports television pundit.

As a player, he was a striker who played top flight football for Arsenal, Manchester City and Sunderland, with spells in the Premier League for both City and the Black Cats. Quinn also received 92 caps for the Republic of Ireland national football team, scoring 21 times, which makes him Ireland&#x27;s second highest goalscorer of all time. He also appeared with the Irish team at the UEFA European Football Championship of 1988 and two FIFA World Cups in 1990 and 2002.

He later was part of a consortium to buy Sunderland and became the club&#x27;s chairman. He also had a spell as manager before stepping down to a role of club director. He left the club in February 2012 and has since worked as a pundit namely on Sky Sports.

==Club career==

===Early career and Gaelic games===
Quinn played Gaelic football for the Perrystown, Dublin 12, club Robert Emmets. He also played underage football and hurling for Dublin. In July 1983, Quinn captained a Dublin Colleges GAA party on a one-month tour of Australia. Aged 16, he played in the 1983 All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship Final, and was offered a contract to play professional Australian rules football before settling on a career in association football. He played for Drimnagh Castle Secondary School team. He also played Gaelic football for County Kildare club Eadestown after his retirement, winning a junior C county title in 2008. He started his career in association football as a youth for Irish club Manortown United and then Lourdes Celtic in Crumlin, Dublin 12.

===Arsenal===
After an unsuccessful trial at Fulham, he signed professional forms with English club Arsenal in 1983. He was signed as a centre-forward, but also had a brief spell as a centre-half for the Arsenal third team. After scoring 18 goals in 18 reserve matches in the first half of the 1985–86 season, Quinn was included in the first-team squad for a match against Liverpool. Quinn scored in the match as Arsenal recorded a 2–0 win. He made a further 11 league appearances for Arsenal that season, but failed to score as they finished seventh in the league. The end of the season brought Quinn his first call-up to the Republic of Ireland national team.

Quinn found himself playing under a new manager for the following season, as George Graham was appointed in place of Don Howe. Quinn had a regular place in the side that season, appearing in 35 league games and scoring eight goals. He also collected a Football League Cup winner&#x27;s medal as Arsenal triumphed 2–1 over Liverpool. However, after Arsenal signed another target man, Alan Smith, in the 1987 close season, Quinn struggled to get into the team. Over the next three seasons he managed a total of just 20 league appearances and five goals – his three appearances in 1988–89 not being enough for a title medal. Quinn&#x27;s lack of opportunities led him to submit a written transfer request at the start of the 1989–90 season. In total he scored 20 goals in 94 appearances for Arsenal, of which 81 were starts.

===Manchester City===
Manchester City manager Howard Kendall signed Quinn for £800,000 in March 1990, shortly before the transfer deadline. He marked his debut with a goal, in a 1–1 draw against Chelsea at Maine Road. He scored 22 times in his first full season, and he went on to spend six years at the club, scoring 78 goals in 245 appearances; his time at City was hampered by a cruciate ligament injury in 1993–94. Although he returned to the side the following season, he managed just eight goals from 35 games.

His most notable game for City was 20 April 1991 when he scored early on and saved a penalty as City beat Derby County 2–1, relegating Derby in the process. City goalkeeper Tony Coton had been sent off before half time for fouling Dean Saunders to concede the penalty. At this time teams rarely named goalkeepers as substitutes, so Quinn replaced Coton in goal. Other notable games included the Manchester derby on 7 November 1993, in which he scored twice in the first half to put City 2–0 up against United by half time, although a remarkable United comeback saw City lose 3–2.

In the 1993 close season, Everton made a bid to sign Quinn and a further bid was made early in the 1993–94 season, but both bids were rejected and Quinn remained at Maine Road for a further three seasons. A cruciate ligament injury sustained in a match against Sheffield Wednesday in November 1993 caused Quinn to miss the majority of the 1993–94 season, and prevented him from playing in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He returned at the start of the 1994–95 season, but the partnership forged by Uwe Rösler and Paul Walsh in his absence meant he was not always a starter. In an attempt to reduce the wage bill, Manchester City tried to sell Quinn in the 1995 close season, but a proposed move to Lisbon club Sporting fell through after failure to agree contractual terms.

He managed a total of 193 league appearances in over six years at Maine Road, and scored a total of 64 goals for them.

===Sunderland===
Quinn finished his career with a highly successful spell at Sunderland, joining the north-east club in August 1996 for a club record £1.3 million, although he missed six months of his first season due to a knee injury – similar to the one which ruined his World Cup chances three years earlier. Before his injury, he had got off to a fine start to his Sunderland career, finding the net twice on his debut in a 4–1 win at Nottingham Forest. In his absence from September to March, Sunderland struggled and although he was back in action by the end of the season, they were relegated.

His partnership with striker Kevin Phillips, signed in the 1997 close season, was one of the most prolific in the Football League in the late 1990s/early 2000s (a combined 194 goals for both players in all competitions from 1997–98 to 2002–03) and helped the club to regain promotion to the Premiership for the 1999–2000 season. In March 1999, Quinn again had to play in goal, this time replacing the injured Thomas Sørensen in a game against Bradford City. In similar circumstances to when playing for Manchester City against Derby County in 1991, Quinn scored and then went in goal, and kept a clean sheet to help his side win. He also has the distinction of being the first player to score at Sunderland&#x27;s Stadium of Light, against Manchester City in 1997. He quickly became a legend at Sunderland, winning both the Sunderland and North East Sportswriters&#x27; Player of the Year awards in 1999 after scoring 21 goals in Sunderland&#x27;s record-breaking Division One title-winning season. His final appearance for Sunderland came on 19 October 2002 against West Ham United.

In a league career lasting 17 years, he had played a total of 475 times in the Premier League and Football League, scoring 141 goals.

==International career==
Quinn played in the qualifiers for the 1986 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship, and made his Irish international debut at under-17 level against Northern Ireland at Seaview in a 6–1 friendly win in January 1985, the first ever fixture between the two nations. Quinn scored a hat trick, as did Eamonn Dolan. However, Arsenal refused permission for Quinn to travel to the 1985 FIFA World Youth Championships.

Quinn made his senior debut as a substitute against the host nation in the Iceland Triangular Tournament in 1986. Quinn played for his country at two World Cups, in 1990 and 2002; he missed the 1994 FIFA World Cup because of injury. Quinn was also a member of the Irish squad that participated in the 1988 European Championship playing just once, as a substitute in the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s 1–0 win over England in Stuttgart.

Quinn scored the equaliser against the Netherlands in the 1990 FIFA World Cup which allowed the Republic to progress to the second round of that tournament. In the qualifiers for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, he scored against Cyprus on his 35th birthday to break the all-time goalscoring record, then held by Frank Stapleton. In the tournament proper, his header set up Robbie Keane&#x27;s late equaliser against Germany, which was the only goal Germany conceded before the final. In the second-round, with the Republic behind 1–0 to Spain, it was a foul on Quinn that led to Ireland&#x27;s last-minute penalty, converted by Robbie Keane, which tied the game and brought extra-time, but the Republic lost 3–2 in the resulting penalty shootout.

After the tournament, he announced his retirement from international football, amassing 92 caps. At the time, he was his country&#x27;s all-time top scorer with 21 goals; this record was later surpassed by Robbie Keane in October 2004.

Quinn had a testimonial match between Sunderland and the Republic of Ireland in 2002. He donated the entire proceeds to charity, an act for which he received a number of awards, including an honorary MBE. Instead of receiving an appearance fee for the game, all the players received a letter from a sick child. Quinn played for both teams during the match, which raised over £1 million. The Republic of Ireland won the match 3–0.

==Post-playing career==

Quinn retired in 2003 at the age of 37, taking a brief coaching role at Sunderland. Quinn has also made appearances as a television pundit and commentator for televised matches involving his former teams with Sky Sports. He made a single league appearance for Thai Premier League side BEC Tero Sasana in March 2006 to promote the league and the side&#x27;s link with Arsenal.

Quinn released an acclaimed autobiography &quot;Niall Quinn – The Autobiography&quot; (2002), which was ghostwritten by Tom Humphries. It won the Best Autobiography category in the inaugural British Sports Book Awards. It was also nominated for a William Hill Sports Book of the Year award. The book is not structured chronologically, but rather in the context of Quinn&#x27;s career swansong, the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan.

A large portion of the proceeds from Quinn&#x27;s 2002 testimonial match were donated to City Hospitals Sunderland to help fund the building of a new children&#x27;s centre. The centre was subsequently named &quot;The Niall Quinn Children&#x27;s Centre&quot; in his honour and Quinn officially opened it in 2004.

Heading the Drumaville Consortium of wealthy Irish businessmen, in June 2006, Quinn successfully brokered a deal to buy a controlling stake in Sunderland. In July, Quinn became the chairman and manager of Sunderland. The deal was finalised on 27 July, with sufficient shares being sold to the consortium in order for them to take complete control.

His managerial career did not get off to a good start as Sunderland lost its first four league games in a row. On 22 August, Sunderland played Bury away in the League Cup where they lost 2–0. After the match, Quinn said that a new manager would be appointed by Sunderland&#x27;s next game. Quinn stepped to one side (to continue in his role as Sunderland chairman) paving the way for Roy Keane to take charge. This was highly unexpected considering the huge rift between the two arising from Keane&#x27;s infamous ejection from the 2002 World Cup. Keane was appointed manager of the club on 28 August. The appointment matured into a great success, with Sunderland clinching an immediate Premier League comeback as Football League Championship champions. Quinn made substantial amounts of money available for buying new players, as he had a declared ambition to establish Sunderland as a top club.

In 2008, he received the James Joyce Award of the Literary &amp; Historical Society in University College Dublin.

In 2010, Quinn was named a patron of the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation.

In October 2011, Ellis Short replaced Quinn as chairman of Sunderland. Quinn was appointed as Director of International Development on behalf of the club and remained in this role until stepping down in February 2012 and after six years involved with the running of the club saying &quot;Everything is in place for Sunderland to really make a statement, which was always my aim&quot;.

Since leaving Sunderland, Quinn is now chairman of a satellite broadband company in Ireland called Q Sat.

In 2012, Quinn started commentating for Sky Sports and normally commentates alongside Martin Tyler.
He won, also in 2012, the North East Football Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Personality of the Year for 2011. In November 2013, Quinn was bestowed with the Freedom of Sunderland award by the city of Sunderland.

In January 2020, Quinn was appointed as interim deputy chief executive officer of the Football Association of Ireland, choosing to go without salary until the financial future of the organisation could be secured. In September 2020 he stepped down from his interim CEO role.

==Fan relationships==
Quinn has his own song titled &quot;Niall Quinn&#x27;s Disco Pants&quot;. The song was originally created by Manchester City supporters during a night out on a pre-season tour in Penola, Italy, in 1992. There had been a bust-up with City team-mate Steve McMahon and Quinn had removed his torn and bloodied shirt and was dancing with Rick Holden wearing just a pair of cut-off jeans. He was &quot;hardly aware&quot; that there were a group of hardcore City fans watching and they treated him to &quot;the first performance of the song that will follow me till the end of my career.&quot;

The song was adopted by Sunderland fans and released as a single by the club&#x27;s dedicated fanzine &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. It reached no. 56 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1999.

Quinn has received praise for his relationship with Sunderland fans. This was highlighted in March 2007 when, during his tenure as chairman, Quinn paid over £8,000 out of club funds to allow around 80 Sunderland fans to travel home by taxi when stranded at Bristol airport after being ejected from their scheduled flight home. The incident happened on Saturday night when Quinn, Sunderland staff and a group of supporters boarded an easyJet flight from Bristol to Newcastle, following Sunderland&#x27;s 1–0 win at Championship promotion rivals Cardiff. After spotting Quinn, many of the fans broke into song, serenading Quinn with &quot;Niall Quinn&#x27;s Disco Pants&quot;.

The EasyJet pilot alleged that a number of supporters were drunk and they were ejected from the plane. Quinn, outraged at the fans&#x27; treatment, also left the plane and commandeered a fleet of taxis and minivans to return the fans home.

==Personal life==
Both Quinn&#x27;s parents are from Thurles, County Tipperary. His father as well as his uncles on his mother&#x27;s side played hurling for Tipperary. He was born in Dublin. He now lives in Kildare. He has been married to the Irish model Gillian Roe since 1992, and they have two children: Aisling and Michael.

In 2011, he also began investing €700,000 in the company behind Q Sat, a satellite broadband business. He went on to be the chairman of QSat, which provided internet service to 3000 homes in Ireland, but shut down in 2017.

In 2005, Quinn was banned for driving for three months and ordered to pay a €200 fine after admitting drink-driving.

He is the founder and president of Team Taca, a private podcast that collaborates with soccer clubs to produce private and localised club podcasts.

<doc id="605915" wikidata="Q5255497" url="?curid=605915" title="Democracy Movement (UK)">
<text>The Democracy Movement in the UK is a crossparty Eurosceptic pressure group with over 320,000 registered supporters and 160 local branches.

==History==
The Democracy Movement was founded in 1998 through a merger of the Referendum Movement, a cross-party successor group to Sir James Goldsmith&#x27;s Referendum Party, and the Euro Information Campaign set up by Yorkshire businessman Paul Sykes.

Sir James&#x27;s widow, Lady Annabel Goldsmith became its president and Sykes became its chairman until he stepped down in 2000 on re-joining the Conservative Party. Lady Annabel&#x27;s son, the businessman Robin Birley, took over as the organisation&#x27;s chairman, serving until 2004.

The Democracy Movement originated from the ideas and 1997 general election campaign of the Referendum Party. At its launch, describing the campaign as an effort &quot;in memory of Jimmy&quot;, Lady Annabel said:

I&#x27;m not anti-European - my husband was half European and my children are a quarter French. I just don&#x27;t want to be governed by Brussels, and I don&#x27;t think people want to give up their sovereignty. Jimmy used to describe it as sitting at the top of the mountain watching a train crash - that was like us heading for the European superstate.
The DM is funded by donations from grassroots supporters, although the Goldsmith family and Paul Sykes made large campaign donations during its early years.

==Policy positions==

The Democracy Movement campaigns on a number of eurosceptic issues such as opposing Britain entering Economic and Monetary Union or the Eurozone and has also campaigned against the EU Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty.

Its opposition to the euro is on the grounds that the British government would lose economic control over interest rates, exchange rates and spending on public services and also that the public would lose democratic control if such economic decisions were passed to EU institutions. On the EU Constitution the Democracy Movement claimed that far from being a &#x27;tidying up exercise&#x27; of existing treaties and powers as the government portrayed, the Constitution represented a fundamental change in the nature of the EU and a significant increase in the centralisation of decision-making power in Brussels. The Movement campaigned for a national referendum on the EU Constitution, which in April 2004 the then Prime Minister Tony Blair conceded. However, following the rejection of the Constitution by similar referendums in France in May 2005 and the Netherlands in June 2005, the UK vote was postponed indefinitely.

In its subsequent &quot;Vision Europe&quot; campaign, the Democracy Movement called for the dismantling of the EU and its replacement with a new flexible and voluntary form of co-operation between European governments, called the &#x27;Europe of Democracies&#x27;. The campaign proposed that powers should be decentralised from Brussels back to elected national parliaments whose laws would resume legal precedence. Trade would be facilitated between countries within Europe and across the world, and an internationalist outlook would be developed. It was also proposed that billions of pounds from the EU budget should be re-distributed to the peoples of Europe.

When the EU Constitution was superseded by the Treaty of Lisbon and the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee declared the treaty to be &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; to the earlier EU Constitution, the Democracy Movement launched a campaign for the government&#x27;s pledge of a referendum to be honoured. The Movement set up a &quot;ReferendumList&quot; website, listing MPs&#x27; views on a referendum and launched a leafleting campaign in more than 130 marginal constituencies of anti-referendum MPs. The leaflets were personalised to the sitting MP in each seat and accused them of taking the public for &quot;fools&quot; in claiming that the Lisbon Treaty was sufficiently different to the EU Constitution that the referendum was no longer justified. In March 2008, MPs voted against a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty by a narrow margin of 63 votes. Thirteen Liberal Democrat MPs rebelled against the party&#x27;s orders to abstain on the referendum vote, with three party spokesmen resigning their posts, and 29 Labour MPs also rebelled against their government&#x27;s opposition to a referendum.

In October 2008 the Democracy Movement was invited to conduct the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign in a mini-referendum on the Lisbon Treaty and on EU membership held in the town of Luton, organised and later televised by the ITV Tonight programme. During the campaign the Movement highlighted the net cost of EU membership, argued that the EU had a role in local post office closures and said that the Lisbon Treaty would centralise even more important decisions in unelected Brussels institutions. A leaflet entitled &quot;Break Free from the outdated EU&quot; was distributed, setting out what the DM called a &quot;better way&quot; of trade and co-operation between European countries being perfectly possible without having to pass ever more decisions to remote EU institutions. The Democracy Movement won the referendum, with 63 per cent of respondents voting against the Lisbon Treaty and 27 per cent for it, while 54 per cent voted against EU membership and 35 per cent in favour.

In 2011 the Democracy Movement continued its drive for an EU referendum as a founding supporter of the cross-party People&#x27;s Pledge campaign for an in-out referendum on Britain&#x27;s membership of the EU. A referendum took place on 23 June 2016, with almost 52% of those who voted, voting to leave the EU.

==Activism==
The Democracy Movement played the major grassroots role in the campaign to &#x27;keep the pound&#x27;, from launch quickly establishing a large crossparty network of supporters and branches ready to campaign against euro membership in the referendum that was then promised. Its then chairman Paul Sykes pledged to spend £20 million on the campaign and the Movement claimed to be distributing &quot;millions&quot; of pro-pound leaflets through a series of &#x27;Democracy Days&#x27; of national, concerted action by its branches.

On 12 January 2001, the DM launched an advertising and leafleting campaign, worth around £500,000, to expose the parliamentary votes of pro-Brussels candidates before the May general elections. The organisation published two million pamphlets that carried provocative headlines about the &#x27;horrors of a European state&#x27; and published full page local newspaper advertisements in the constituencies of politicians in 120 &quot;target&quot; seats. Reflecting the dominant Labour government of the time, these included 70 Labour MPs, 35 Liberal Democrats, six Conservatives and three Scottish National Party candidates.

The Movement&#x27;s 2008 campaign for a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty asked supporters to write to their MPs and submit the responses they received to a &quot;ReferendumList&quot; website, highlighting MPs&#x27; views. Further aiming to &#x27;name and shame&#x27; anti-referendum MPs, this was accompanied by a leafleting campaign involving the distribution of 10,000 leaflets in each of more than 130 marginal constituencies where the MP opposed an EU referendum.

The DM has published a quarterly magazine, &quot;These Tides&quot;, in support of eurosceptic pressure groups across the continent. Its stated aim is to &quot;keep the international family of activists working for the post-EU Europe&quot;. Contributors have included Norman Tebbit, Tony Benn, Gisela Stuart and John Redwood.

<text>South of Scotland was one of the eight electoral regions of the Scottish Parliament when it was created in 1999. The region was replaced with South Scotland in 2011 following a review.

Nine of the parliament&#x27;s 73 first past the post constituencies were sub-divisions of the region and it elected seven of the 56 additional-member Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Thus it elected a total of 16 MSPs.

The region had boundaries with the West of Scotland, Central Scotland and Lothians regions.

==Constituencies and council areas==

The constituencies were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of Westminster constituencies, as existing in at that time. They cover all of three council areas, the Scottish Borders council area, the Dumfries and Galloway council area and the South Ayrshire council area, and parts of five others, the East Ayrshire council area, the East Lothian council area, the Midlothian council area, the North Ayrshire council area and the South Lanarkshire council area:

The rest of the East Ayrshire council area is within the Central Scotland electoral region, the rest of the East Lothian and Midlothian council areas are within the Lothians region, the rest of the North Ayrshire council area is within the West of Scotland region and the rest of the South Lanarkshire council area is divided between the Central Scotland and Glasgow regions.

<doc id="605929" wikidata="Q1110899" url="?curid=605929" title="Pinarello">
<text>Cicli Pinarello S.p.A. is an Italian bicycle manufacturer based in Treviso, Italy. Founded in 1953, it supplies mostly handmade bicycles for the road, track, E-bikes(NYTRO), mountain bikes and cyclo-cross. The company also produces an in-house component brand – MOST.

==History==
 was born in Catena di Villorba, Italy in 1922. He was the eighth of 12 brothers. At the age of 15, Giovanni began making bicycles at the factory of Paglianti. After a successful amateur career he turned professional in 1947, aged 25. Pinarello died on 4 September 2014.

In December 2016, Pinarello sold a majority stake for a reported €90-million (US$134-million) in equity value to investment management firm L Catterton with Alantra acting as their advisor. In June 2023, L Catteron sold their stake for an estimated US$175-million to Ivan Glasenberg, the Swiss-South African billionaire and former chief executive officer of Glencore, with Houlihan Lokey acting as the advisor for the seller.

Originally, all Pinarello frames were steel. Pinarello used Columbus tubing for most of the 1980s but with tubing by Oria in the lower models in 1989. The first non-Italian tube was Tange Prestige for the US-based Levis Cycling team headed by Michael Fatka and ridden by Andrew Hampsten, Steve Tilford, Roy Knickmann, Thurlow Rogers in the mid-1980s. As noted above, the Banesto Line introduced in 1993 exclusively utilized Oria tubing: Oria Cromovan, Oria ML34, and Oria ML25. Throughout the 1990s until 2004, Pinarello produced frames from conventional steel tubing using lugs, oversize tubing, oversize aluminium with TIG welded joints, magnesium and frames of carbon fiber and other materials.

==Models==
===Historical models===

The Pinarello Montello SLX was a landmark model for Pinarello as this was the frame with which Pinarello achieved their first major pro victories. This model frame was one of the most responsive of the mid to late 1980s as shown by wins in events such as the 1984 Summer Olympics Road Race, Vuelta a España, the Giro d&#x27;Italia and stages of the Tour de France. The Montello had a brake cable through the top tube, chrome sloping front fork and chrome on the drive side chain stay; later models had the full rear triangle chromed. The Montello SLX was in red, blue and Spumoni. Pinarellos from the mid-1980s often have the decals restored by owners as factory-applied decals were prone to flaking off.
The Montello was available in 2 versions: frame from Columbus SL with SLX fork, or fabricated from Columbus full SLX double butted tubing with rifling down the inside center. The bottom bracket was investment cast with the Pinarello logo and the dropouts were by Campagnolo. Braze-ons for down-tube shifters, front derailleur and two water bottles were provided. The GPT logo (for Giovanni Pinarello, Treviso) appeared in many locations.

The Pinarello Treviso was the second-in-line model under the Montello SLX in the mid-to-late &#x27;80&#x27;s. Built with Columbus SL tubing, it featured a painted fork and seat stays, with chromed chain stays. This model also featured the sloping fork crown. On the road it is easily distinguished from the Montello by the single chrome chain stay. However, some older models of the Treviso (1981) did not have the chrome chain stay.

After the Montello SLX, Pinarello departed from his standard production design with parallel seat and head tube angles and created the Gavia. This provided more saddle setback than the Montello or other Pinarello designs. Greg LeMond, the winner of the Tour de France in 1986, 1989 and 1990, promoted designs that pushed the saddle further back. The Gavia was constructed of Columbus TSX tubing. This model was available in red, blue with pearl white panels and pearl white with fluorescent splatter.
The Banesto Line was released in 1993 following Miguel Indurain&#x27;s first two Tour de France (1991 and 1992) and first Giro d&#x27;Italia (1992) wins. Based upon Indurain&#x27;s preference, all Banesto Line frames were constructed with Oria tubing. The Banesto Line was headlined by Indurain&#x27;s Time Trial bike, debuting at the 1992 Giro with a remarkable advance in steel frames as it featured Tig welded custom aerodynamic tubing and custom aerodynamic seat post with internal shifter and brake cable routing. This TT bike represented an early example, possibly the first, of experimentation with airfoil tubing in the pro peloton. Only three of these TT framesets are known to have been constructed. Prior to the 1992 Giro, Indurain had ridden a Banesto painted TT bike with a round tubeset. The Banesto Line included the Tig welded Ciclo Cromovan Record 93, the Ciclo ML 34 Record 93 with a chromed fork and chrome rear triangle as well as the Ciclo ML 25 Veloce 93. The Banesto Line were supplied with Campagnolo components, Mavic rims, Aci Inox spokes, Vittoria tires, ITM handlebars and Indurain&#x27;s preferred Selle Italia Turbo saddles. Riding his Pinarello Banesto Line bicycles, Indurain was the last cyclist to win the Tour on a steel bicycle. In 1997, the steel Banesto Line had changed from the white frames to utilize standard Pinarello blue and white color schemes along with Banesto badging on the downtube. In 1998, the Banesto Line included the new Paris aluminum frameset and updated Pinarello logo.
The Pinarello Paris in the mid-1990s was a 7005 series aluminium bike with an aluminium fork later replaced by the aria carbon fork. It was upon this frame that Jan Ullrich and Bjarne Riis won the Tour de France. Winner of the 2007 Editor&#x27;s Choice award for a road racing bicycle from &quot;Bicycling Magazine&quot;, the Pinarello Paris FP is the premier monocoque, high modulus, unidirectional carbon fiber frame. In 2009, the FP6 replaced the Paris FP and F4:13. The monocoque frame uses the same mold as the Paris FP, but with different carbon fiber (30HM3K).
Pinarello has been slow to jump aboard the all-carbon juggernaut, preferring to concentrate on its highly regarded magnesium-frame technology as showcased in the Dogma series of bikes. But the attraction and momentum of carbon is unavoidable, and while the all-carbon F4:13 hasn&#x27;t displaced the Dogma at the top of Pinarello&#x27;s line-up, it is clearly a serious and purposeful attempt to use the material&#x27;s properties to best advantage, starting with one-piece main frame construction to exploit carbon&#x27;s stiffness and low weight.

===Contemporary road models===
The Pinarello FP Uno was the current base model bicycle built by Pinarello evolving from its predecessor, the FP1. The FP Uno features hydroformed asymmetric 6061 T6 triple butted aluminium tubing. The next superior model is the Pinarello FP Due. Like the FP Uno, this has evolved from its predecessor, the FP2. The frame is constructed from 24HM12K carbon fibre. The Pinarello FP Quattro is built from 30HM12K carbon fibre and features carbon asymmetric stays with Onda carbon forks. The Quattro also utilises the new iCR internal cable routing system, which has been developed in house, by Pinarello.

The Pinarello Neor replaced the FP Uno as Pinarellos base road bike model, featuring the same hydroformed aluminum frame as the FP Uno, but now boasts a carbon fibre rear triangle as well as ONDA carbon front forks. The Pinarello FPTEAM Carbon is constructed from 24HM12K uni-directional carbon fibre and features both tapered 1 &quot;1/8 1&quot; 1/4 ONDA front forks and ONDA rear triangles. The Pinarello Rahza is a full 24HM12K carbon fibre frame, featuring an asymmetrical monocoque design which improved frame rigidity. The frame also features ONDA forks and rear stays as well as the BB30 bottom bracket. The Pinarello Marvel is an entirely new asymmetry frame originating from the Pinarello Paris (constructed from Torayca 50HM1.5 carbon fibre) made from 30HM12K carbon. Rigidity of the frame is further improved by the usage of a tapered headset (1&quot; 1/8 - 1&quot; 1/2) as well as featuring internal cable routing. Pinarello say that the Marvel is &quot;top level bike and already UCI approved for use in official competitions.&quot; The Marvel also makes full use of the Think2 system allowing the usage of both electronic and mechanical groupsets. Other new features include the new ONDA2V front fork and a new aerodynamic downtube.

====GAN series====
For 2016 Pinarello updated their product line starting with new mid-level bikes up to models just below the Dogma Series. All GAN Series models take styling and design cues from the Dogma F8. The entry level GAN stems directly from the design efforts of the Dogma F8, whilst having a less &#x27;extreme&#x27; style which aids riding comfort. The GAN Disk variant contains the same features as the GAN but also includes disk brakes, both models are manufactured from T600 carbon fibre. The GAN S features an all T700 carbon fibre frame, whilst still maintaining design features akin to the F8. The top of the class model is the GAN RS which features a higher strength T900 Toray carbon.

====Dogma series====

The Pinarello Dogma was the first of the current top line of bicycle made by the company and was the first bicycle of a &#x27;new generation&#x27; of frames, it is the successor to the Pinarello Prince range and was released for sale to the public in 2010. The frames focus around a completely asymmetric design made entirely of 60HM1K carbon fibre, with the right hand side of the Dogma frame different in shape and section to that of the left side, thus providing increased rigidity against forces placed upon the frame by pedalling.

In 2011 the successor the Dogma, the Pinarello Dogma 2 was revealed at the 2011 Tour de France. The Dogma 2 featured aerodynamic improvements which increased the efficiency of the frame.
Bradley Wiggins rode the Dogma 2 to victory in the 2012 Tour de France. In 2012, mountain bike trials rider, Martyn Ashton, created a video in which he performed several tricks and stunts on a Dogma 2. The video, entitled &quot;Road Bike Party&quot;, went viral, gaining over half a million views in one day, and it currently has over eight million views on YouTube.

The Pinarello Dogma K features Pinarellos &#x27;Century Ride&#x27; geometry and uses frame design that provides increased comfort without compromising overall performance. As with other modern Pinarellos, the frame incorporates an asymmetrical design which offsets the asymmetric forces created by pedalling. The Dogma K and the Dogma frame differ from each other in the angle of the seat tube, brought back to increase shock absorption, and reduced head tube angle as well as slightly longer chain stays to increase comfort. Furthermore, a longer wheelbase makes for a frame that is less rigid vertically, improving shock absorption. The Pinarello ROKH frame was made in an effort to offer the excellent performance of the DOGMA K to a wider group of cyclists. The ROKH&#x27;s geometry is similar in shape and construction but with an even longer wheel base to add even more vertical compliance than the Dogma K. The Dogma K Hydro mirrors the new model variation seen with the Dogma 65.1, whereby hydraulic disc brakes have now been added. The Hydro features new ONDA HD (Hydraulic Disc) forks, as well as new chainstays accommodating the RAD braking system seen on both the DOGMA XC and Dogma 65.1 Hydro.

The 2013 generation of the Dogma bicycle is the Dogma 65.1 Think2. When compared to the Dogma2, the Think2 features stronger and more rigid carbon fibre, 65HM1K, yielding a more reactive frame. Moreover, the Think2 has been built with the new electronic shifting group sets in mind, and thus has internal cable routing for both Shimano and Campagnolo systems. The 2014 Dogma 65.1 Hydro variant of the Dogma is virtually the same as the 2013 Think2 model, made from Torayca 65Ton HM 1K carbon fibre with &quot;Nanoalloy technology&quot;. The Hydro however, accommodates hydraulic disc brakes and features a new front fork developed from the previous ONDA2 fork, called the ONDA HD (Hydraulic Disk). The frame also features new chainstays which accommodate the new &quot;RAD braking system&quot;, derived from the development of the Dogma XC. Chris Froome rode the Dogma 65.1 Think2 to victory in the 2013 Tour de France.

In May 2014 the Pinarello Dogma F8 was revealed as part of Pinarellos 2015 product launch, with the name deriving from this particular Dogma model being the 8th generation. The new bike was developed in conjunction with Team Sky sponsor and car manufacturer Jaguar and takes design cues (such as the front fork shape) from the Bolide time trial bike. Research advancements have led to claimed aerodynamic gains, with the F8 being 26.1% more aerodynamic than the Dogma 65.1, 6.4% more aerodynamic when including the bike rider and the frameset alone being 40% more aerodynamically efficient than the predecessor. The bike is expected to debut at the 2014 Critérium du Dauphiné.

In April 2015, just days ahead of the Tour of Flanders Pinarello, along with Jaguar-Land Rover and , unveiled the Dogma K8-S – a replacement for the cobble-focused Dogma K. The most striking aspect of the new bike is the rear suspension system, dubbed the Dogma Suspension System, which can provide up to 10mm of travel; this however, is not the first time road bikes have been fitted with suspension. The bike was designed in conjunction with Jaguar and features the aerodynamic fork from the Dogma F8, which in conjunction with the suspension system is claimed to reduce vibrations by 50%, with data from Jaguar-Land Rover showing an increase in speed of 8% and a reduction in energy usage of 10%. A version of the bike will also be made which does not have the suspension system built in - the Dogma K8. In May 2015, the company launched the Dogma F8 Disk in preparation for the UCI&#x27;s review on the use of disk brakes in road competitions. The bike is essentially the same as the standard F8 in terms of performance and characteristics. In December 2015, the company launched a limited edition variant of the F8, the Dogma F8w, which uses the wireless SRAM RED eTap groupset. In 2016, just before the 2016 Tour de France the company launched the Dogma F8 Xlight.

In January 2017, the company revealed its new flagship bike, the Dogma F10. Unlike in previous years where Pinarello have unveiled their new products to coincide with the Giro d&#x27;Italia, the F10 was revealed before the start of the 2017 season. The team-bikes were equipped with Shimanos newest 9150 Dura-Ace Di2 groupset, whilst Pinarello claimed the F10 was 6.3% lighter and 7% stiffer than its predecessor (still composed of Torayca T1100 1K carbon), whilst a 53 cm unpainted frame has a claimed weight of only 820g. The F10 also has a 12.6% claimed aerodynamic advantage over the F8, coming in part from the &#x27;concave&#x27; back shaped aerofoils (also found on the second version of the Bolide time trial bike). The F10 also has a number of aerodynamic devices which have been taken from other models, the aforementioned Bolide, as well as Bradley Wiggins&#x27; hour record bike. Only hours after its release, Taiwanese bike manufacturer - Velocite - claimed that new F10 and the second version of the Bolide infringe three of its patents. The F10 will also be available to the public immediately. During the 2017 Giro d&#x27;Italia a number of riders tested the Dogma F10 X-Light - a lightweight version of the F10 - in readiness for the 2017 Tour de France. Pinarello claim an unpainted X-Light weighs in at 760g for a 53 cm sized frame. In mid-July the company announced the Dogma F10 Disc would be produced for sale. A day later the company revealed the Dogma K10, taking aerodynamic and visual cues from the F10 forebear and the electronically controlled suspension variant, the Dogma K10S Disk.

In May 2019, the company revealed the successor to the Dogma F10, the Dogma F12 which is launched alongside Team Ineos.

===Time trial and triathlon models===
Following the success of Pinarello&#x27;s first experiment with aero tubing in Indurain&#x27;s 1992 Banesto Line time trial bike, Pinarello developed the carbon monocoque Espada with input from Formula 1 expert Giacchi for the 1994 Hour Record attempt. This was Pinarello&#x27;s first carbon frame. Indurain succeeded in setting a new standard on the Espada by breaking 53 kph for the first time with a mark of 53.040 kph. Indurain gained further success on the Espada in the 1995 Tour, winning both long time trials, before returning to a Banesto Line frame to win the 1996 Olympic time trial.

The Pinarello Montello FP8 was a time trial bicycle manufactured by Pinarello prior to the introduction of the Graal. It was made with aerospace grade carbon fibre composite. The 50HM3K carbon fibre creates an ultra stiff and light ride.
The Pinarello Graal is a time trial frame manufactured by Pinarello. The Graal was designed using CFD techniques, maximizing the efficiency of the bicycle. The frame is available in both an electronic version and mechanical version, with the electronic version featuring an internally mounted battery.
The Pinarello Bolide was released on 2 May 2013 with gains of a 15% reduction in aerodynamic drag and 5% reduction in weight over the Graal. Team Sky&#x27;s 2012 Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins used the new bike at the 2013 Giro d&#x27;Italia. The Bolide has been in development for over year with both Pinarello lab technicians and Team Sky working on the bike. The Bolide uses aeroplane wing-shaped tubular sections in conjunction with a &#x27;concave back&#x27; on the seat tube. This allows the rear wheel and frame to be closer together. In addition, the brakes are shielded behind leading small fairings and the frame utilizes integrated cabling to further minimize drag.

On 21 June 2013 Pinarello released their second (in-house developed) &quot;high end&quot; time trial frame within two months, called the Pinarello Sibilo. The Sibilo will debut at the 2013 Tour de France with Alejandro Valverde of Movistar Team. Early impressions are that the Sibilo shares some common features with the Bolide, such as; airfoil tubing, track style rear dropouts and a &#x27;concave back&#x27;. Moreover, the Sibilo carries some aerodynamic refinements over the Bolide, for example, the front brake is further integrated into the forks and the rear brake has been moved towards the chainstays. These modifications remove the need for the brake fairings which are seen on the Bolide. The Sibilo is constructed from the same Torayca 65HM1K carbon as the Bolide, with internal cable routing for extra aerodynamic benefit. The Sibilo utilizes the stiff BB86 bottom bracket and can also accommodate both mechanical groupsets such as the Shimano Dura-Ace and Campagnolo Super Record sets, as well as their electronic variants (Dura-Ace Di2 and Campagnolo EPS).
The Pinarello Xirion is designed specifically for triathletes by utilizing favorable frame geometry and is made from 24HM Unidirectional carbon fibre. The Xirion is sold as a complete bicycle fitted with Vision cycling components.

In light of Bradley Wiggins&#x27; hour record attempt, Pinarello collaborated with Jaguar to produce the Bolide HR. The HR variant has aero-optimised front forks, seat stays and dropouts. The bike also features printed titanium bars. In 2015, the endurance part of the Italian national cycling team received Bolide HR bikes. At the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, Filippo Ganna rode his Bolide HR to victory in the Individual Pursuit.

In May 2016, three years after its initial introduction, the Pinarello Bolide TT was released exclusively to Team Sky. The first race-ready model of the bike will be given to Mikel Landa for use on the Stage 9 time trial at the 2016 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

<text>TOMRA is a Norwegian multinational corporation manufacturing collection and sorting products, such as reverse vending machines for the food, recycling and mining industries. With over 82,000 (RVMs) installed, 10,000 food sorters and 6,000 recycling systems worldwide, TOMRA is the market leader in its industries.

TOMRA is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSEBX) under the ticker symbol TOM. The parent company, Tomra Systems ASA, is headquartered in Asker, Norway, with central departments located in Mülheim-Kärlich, Germany and Shelton, Connecticut.

==History==
=== 1970s ===
TOMRA was founded by the two brothers Tore Planke and Petter Planke in 1972. It started out with the design, manufacturing and sale of reverse vending machines (RVMs) for automated collection of used beverage containers. In 1974, the Swedish entity Systembolaget ordered 100 RVMs.

=== 1980s–2000s ===
TOMRA was listed in Oslo Børs on 18 January 1985 and tried to secure a position in the American market to no avail. It was then entered the market in 1990s. By 1999, sales in the US accounted for more than half of total revenues. In 2006, TOMRA delivered more than 8000 new reverse vending systems to Germany.

TOMRA&#x27;s sensor-based sorting technology business was first established in 2004 with the acquisition of TiTech Visionsort AS, a provider of optical recognition and sorting technology (which was renamed to Tomra Sorting Solutions in 2012), from Ferd AS for 219 million NOK.

With the acquisition of Orwak in 2005, Tomra added compaction and baling products. In December 2014, TOMRA sold the Orwak operations in Norway, Sweden, Poland and Japan under the name TOMRA Compaction to San Sac Nordic AB of Sweden.

On 31 August 2005, TOMRA Latasa Reciclagem S.A., offering aluminium can collection and recycling assets services in Brazil, Chile, and Argentina, was acquired by Aleris International, Inc.

On 1 July 2006, TOMRA&#x27;s subsidiary Titech Visionsort AS acquired Germany-based CommoDaS GmbH, a provider of recognition and sorting technology for metals, plastics, glass, minerals and gems, for approximately 100 million NOK.

On 1 July 2008 TOMRA announced it bought Australian peer Ultrasort Group, a provider of advanced recognition and sorting technology to the mining industry, for 160 million NOK ($31.48 million).

=== 2010–2019 ===
Via several acquisitions, TOMRA had secured 75% global market share in RVMs, 60% in material recovery and 40–65% in sorting.

On 12 December 2010, TOMRA&#x27;s subsidiary TiTech acquired Dublin-based food technology company Odenberg, a designer of equipment used for producing 65 per cent of all French fries worldwide, for up to €57.5 million from ACT Venture Capital in Dublin and members of the Van den Bergh family in Belgium; Odenberg&#x27;s chilling/freezing unit was later considered a non-core business and sold in 2013 as to a newly formed company, Power Food Technology Ltd., of Ireland.

On 31 December 2011, TOMRA sold the assets of Tomra Pacific, Inc., a recycler of used beverage containers in California, to rePlanet, LLC for approximately $25 million.

In June 2012, TOMRA purchased Belgium-based food sorting specialist Best Kwadraat for €138 million.

In October 2016 TOMRA signed an agreement to acquire Compac Holding Ltd., a New Zealand-based provider of packing house automation systems that sort fresh produce based on weight, size, shape, color, surface blemishes, and internal quality, for $70 million plus up to $230 million in earn-outs available to Compac founders; the transaction was completed in March 2017.

On 26 February 2018, TOMRA signed an agreement to acquire BBC Technologies. The deal added BBC Technologies&#x27; precision grading systems and punnet and clamshell filling technology for blueberries and other small fruits.

== Competition law compliance ==
In 2001, the EU Commission performed an investigation of Tomra&#x27;s competition law compliance. Based on this investigation, the Commission concluded in March 2006 that TOMRA in their opinion had foreclosed competition in the period 1998 to 2002 in the market for reverse vending machines in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden by implementing an exclusionary strategy. TOMRA appealed the decision to the European General Court in 2006.

In September 2010, the Court issued their judgment where they dismissed Tomra&#x27;s appeal both on the substance and on the amount of the fine. TOMRA consequently accrued €28.2 million (NOK 226.1 million) for the fine and accumulated interest in the third quarter financial statement for 2010. TOMRA appealed this decision again but finally lost the case in April 2012.

<doc id="605939" wikidata="Q1905968" url="?curid=605939" title="Akira (1988 film)">
<text>is a 1988 Japanese animated cyberpunk action film directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, produced by Ryōhei Suzuki and Shunzō Katō, and written by Otomo and Izo Hashimoto, based on Otomo&#x27;s 1982 manga &quot;Akira&quot;. Set in a dystopian 2019, it tells the story of Shōtarō Kaneda, the leader of a biker gang whose childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, acquires incredible telekinetic abilities after a motorcycle accident, eventually threatening an entire military complex amid chaos and rebellion in the sprawling futuristic metropolis of Neo-Tokyo.

While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the manga, the plot differs considerably and does not include much of the last half of the manga, which continued publication for two years after the film&#x27;s release. The soundtrack, which draws heavily from traditional Indonesian gamelan and Japanese noh music, was composed by Shōji Yamashiro and performed by Geinoh Yamashirogumi.

&quot;Akira&quot; was released in Japan on July 16, 1988, by Toho; it was released the following year in the United States by Streamline Pictures. It garnered an international cult following after various theatrical and VHS releases, eventually earning over $80million worldwide in home video sales. 

&quot;Akira&quot; has since been cited as a masterpiece and as among the greatest films ever made, especially in the field of animation and the action and science fiction genres. A landmark in Japanese animation, and the most influential and iconic anime film ever made, it is also considered a pivotal film in the cyberpunk genre, particularly the Japanese cyberpunk subgenre, as well as adult animation. The film had a significant effect on popular culture worldwide, paving the way for the growth of anime and Japanese popular culture in the Western world as well as influencing numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television, and video games.

== Plot ==

In 2019, following a world war triggered by the sudden destruction of Tokyo on July 16, 1988, Neo-Tokyo is plagued by corruption, anti-government protests, terrorism, and gang violence. During a violent rally, the hot-headed Shōtarō Kaneda leads his vigilante &quot;bōsōzoku&quot; gang, the Capsules, against the rival Clown gang. Kaneda&#x27;s best friend, Tetsuo Shima, inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into Takashi, an esper who escaped from a government laboratory with the aid of a resistance organization. Assisted by fellow esper Masaru, Japan Self-Defense Forces Colonel Shikishima recaptures Takashi, has Tetsuo hospitalized, and arrests the Capsules. While being interrogated by the police, Kaneda meets Kei, an activist within the resistance movement, and tricks the authorities into releasing her with his gang.

At a secret government facility, Shikishima and his head of research, Doctor Ōnishi, discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities similar to Akira, the esper responsible for Tokyo&#x27;s 1988 destruction. Esper Kiyoko forewarns Shikishima of Neo-Tokyo&#x27;s impending destruction, but the city&#x27;s parliament dismisses Shikishima&#x27;s concerns, leading him to consider killing Tetsuo to prevent another cataclysm. Meanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital, steals Kaneda&#x27;s motorcycle, and tries to flee Neo-Tokyo with his girlfriend Kaori, but the Clowns ambush them. The Capsules rescue Tetsuo and Kaori, but Tetsuo suffers intense headaches and hallucinations and is re-hospitalized.

Overhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers, Kaneda joins Kei&#x27;s resistance cell. At the hospital, the espers try killing Tetsuo via hallucinations, but the attempt is thwarted. A frustrated Tetsuo searches for them, killing any orderlies and militiamen blocking his path. The resistance group infiltrates the hospital, and Kiyoko draws Kei and Kaneda into Shikishima and the espers&#x27; futile attempts to stop Tetsuo. Kiyoko tells Tetsuo that Akira, located in cryonic storage beneath the Olympic Stadium&#x27;s construction site, could help Tetsuo with his powers. After betraying everyone around him, especially Kaneda, Tetsuo flees the hospital to hunt for Akira.

Using Kei as a medium to stop Tetsuo, Kiyoko breaks her and Kaneda out of military custody. Shikishima stages a coup d&#x27;état against Neo-Tokyo&#x27;s government and directs its military forces to destroy Tetsuo at any cost. At the Capsules&#x27; former hangout, Harukiya Bar, Tetsuo confronts gangmates Yamagata and Kai over Kaneda&#x27;s bike and kills Yamagata after his protest. Kai relays the news to Kaneda, who vows to avenge his friend, while Takashi brings Kei away. Mistaken for Akira by cultists, Tetsuo rampages through Neo-Tokyo, arriving at Akira&#x27;s cryogenic storage dewar under the stadium. Kei fights Tetsuo, but he defeats her and exhumes Akira, only to find his remains sealed in jars for scientific research.

Kaneda fights Tetsuo with a laser rifle, and Shikishima fires an orbital weapon at him. While the latter destroys his arm, neither can stop him. Shikishima and Kaori approach the stadium, where Tetsuo, now with a robotic arm, is in great pain and losing control over his powers. Kaori tries restraining Tetsuo while Shikishima unsuccessfully offers to heal his injuries and help control his abilities. Kaneda again fights Tetsuo, who, weakened from the missing arm, mutates into a gigantic mass of flesh, engulfing Kaneda and killing Kaori. The espers revive Akira to stop the growing mass. Reuniting with his friends, Akira creates a singularity, drawing Tetsuo and Kaneda into another dimension. The espers teleport Shikishima to a safe distance as the singularity destroys Neo-Tokyo in a mirror of Tokyo&#x27;s previous destruction, and they agree to rescue Kaneda, knowing they will not return to this dimension as a result.

In the singularity, Kaneda experiences Tetsuo and the espers&#x27; childhoods, including his and Tetsuo&#x27;s friendship and the espers&#x27; psychic training before Tokyo&#x27;s destruction. The espers return Kaneda to Neo-Tokyo, informing him that Akira will take Tetsuo to safety and that Kei is developing psychic powers. Ōnishi witnesses the birth of a universe but is killed in his lab&#x27;s destruction. After consuming most of Neo-Tokyo, the singularity disappears, and water floods the crater left in its place. Mourning Tetsuo&#x27;s loss, Kaneda discovers that Kei and Kai have survived, and they ride off into the ruins while Shikishima watches the sunrise. At an unspecified plane of reality, Tetsuo introduces himself and triggers the creation of a universe, finally transcending the limitations of human existence.

== Production ==
While working on the &quot;Akira&quot; manga, Katsuhiro Otomo did not intend to adapt the series; however, he became &quot;very intrigued&quot; when the offer to develop his work for the screen was put before him. He agreed to an anime film adaptation of the series on the grounds that he retained creative control of the project – this insistence was based on his experiences working on &quot;Harmagedon&quot;. The Akira Committee was the name given to a partnership of several major Japanese entertainment companies brought together to realize production of an &quot;Akira&quot; film. The group&#x27;s assembly was necessitated by the unconventionally high starting budget of around ¥500,000,000, intended to achieve the desired epic standard equal to Otomo&#x27;s over 2,000-page manga tale. The committee consisted of Kodansha, Mainichi Broadcasting System, Bandai, Hakuhodo, Toho, LaserDisc Corporation and Sumitomo Corporation who all forwarded money and promotion towards the film. The animation for the film was provided for by animation producers, Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now TMS Entertainment).

&quot;Akira&quot; had pre-scored dialogue (wherein the dialogue is recorded before the film starts production and the movements of the characters&#x27; lips are animated to match it; a first for an anime production and extremely unusual even today for an anime, although the voice actors did perform with the aid of animatics), and super-fluid motion as realized in the film&#x27;s more than 160,000 animation cels. Computer-generated imagery was also used in the film (created by High-Tech Lab. Japan Inc. and the cooperative companies for computer graphics, Sumisho Electronic Systems, Inc. and Wavefront Technologies), primarily to animate the pattern indicator used by Doctor Ōnishi, but it was additionally used to plot the paths of falling objects, model parallax effects on backgrounds, and tweak lighting and lens flares. Unlike its live-action predecessors, &quot;Akira&quot; also had the budget to show a fully realized futuristic Tokyo. The animation was photographed onto 65mm film, using an aspect ratio of 1.85:1.

The film&#x27;s production budget was (), with the combined production and advertising budget believed to be reaching (). Some sources claim it to the most expensive anime film at the time of release, but this claim is disputed by Crunchyroll writer Daryl Harding.

The teaser trailer for &quot;Akira&quot; was released in 1987. The film&#x27;s main production was completed in 1987, with sound recording and mixing performed in early 1988. It was released in 1988, two years before the manga officially ended in 1990. Otomo is claimed to have filled 2,000 pages of notebooks, containing various ideas and character designs for the film, but the final storyboard consisted of a trimmed-down 738 pages. He had great difficulty completing the manga; Otomo has stated that the inspiration for its conclusion arose from a conversation that he had with Alejandro Jodorowsky. He later recalled that the film project had to begin with the writing of an ending that would bring suitable closure to major characters, storylines, and themes without being extraordinarily lengthy, so that he could know in reverse order which manga elements would make the cut into the anime and thus suitably resolve the manga&#x27;s various elements into a lean, two-hour story. Otomo has called making the film before finishing the manga &quot;the worst possible idea&quot;. Although he came to like having two similar but different versions of the same story, he still felt too much of the original was cut out of the film.

Otomo is a big fan of &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot;. As a result, his naming conventions match the characters featured in &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot;: Kaneda shares his name with the protagonist of &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot;; Colonel Shikishima shares his name with Professor Shikishima of &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot;, while Tetsuo is named after Shikishima&#x27;s son Tetsuo Shikishima; &quot;Akira&quot;″s Ryūsaku is named after Ryūsaku Murasame. In addition, Takashi has a &quot;26&quot; tattooed on his hand which closely resembles the font used in &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot;. The namesake of the series, &quot;Akira&quot;, is the 28th in a line of psychics that the government has developed, the same number as &quot;Tetsujin-28&quot;.

One of the film&#x27;s key animators was Makiko Futaki; she went on to become a lead animator for Studio Ghibli films such as &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; (1989), &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; (1997) and &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2004), before passing away in 2016. Another key animator who worked on &quot;Akira&quot; was former animator Yoshiji Kigami; he animated several entire scenes in &quot;Akira&quot;, such as the action scene in the sewers. He later joined Kyoto Animation.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval score of 91% based on 54 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Akira&quot; is strikingly bloody and violent, but its phenomenal animation and sheer kinetic energy helped set the standard for modern anime.&quot; 

From contemporary reviews, Tony Rayns commented in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; that the narrative was paced at such &quot;speed and complexity&quot; that &quot;viewers who come to it without prior knowledge of the &quot;manga&quot; (comic-strip) version tend to find it almost overpowering&quot; concluding that &quot;The film virtually demands to be &#x27;read&#x27; alongside the &quot;manga&quot;, and amounts to a kind of commentary on it.&quot; Discussing the story, Rayns found the film &quot;not particularly ground-breaking as science fiction&quot; comparing the film to be between &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; with the film&#x27;s main achievement being &quot;the sheer credibility of his vision of future-tech, as seen in fully thorough designs of vehicles, laboratory equipment&quot; and that the film &quot;yields some extremely arresting images in the film&#x27;s closing scenes&quot; and that &quot;Simply as animation, &quot;Akira&quot; is an undoubted &quot;tour de force&quot;.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praises aspects of the film &quot;from the imaginative and detailed design of tomorrow to the booming Dolby effects on the soundtrack&quot; but criticizes the &quot;slight stiffness in the drawing of human movement&quot;. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s Dave Kehr commends Otomo&#x27;s &quot;excellent animation-specific ideas: Vehicles leave little color trails as they roar through the night, and there are a number of dream sequences that make nice use of the medium&#x27;s ability to confound scale and distort perspective&quot;.

From retrospective reviews, Anime News Network&#x27;s Bamboo Dong commends the Limited Edition&#x27;s DVD for its &quot;superbly translated&quot; English subtitles and the commendable English dubbing, which &quot;sticks very close to the English translation, and the voice actors deliver their lines with emotion&quot;. THEM Anime&#x27;s Raphael See applauds the film&#x27;s &quot;astounding special effects and clean, crisp animation&quot;. Chris Beveridge comments on the Japanese audio, which brings &quot;the forward soundstage nicely into play when required. Dialogue is well placed, with several key moments of directionality used perfectly&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commends Otomo&#x27;s artwork, stating &quot;the drawings of Neo-Tokyo by night are so intricately detailed that all the individual windows of huge skyscrapers appear distinct. And these night scenes glow with subtle, vibrant color&quot;. Richard Harrison of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; comments on the pace of the film, stating that the author &quot;has condensed the narrative sprawl of the comics to provide coherence, though there&#x27;s a bit of &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; incompleteness to the story. That hardly matters, since the film moves with such kinetic energy that you&#x27;ll be hanging on for dear life&quot;. Roger Ebert compares the film to &quot;Mad Max&quot;, calling it &quot;very gory, very gruesome, but entertaining in its own demented way.&quot; Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot; commends the film&#x27;s &quot;scintillating animated visuals, with not one – not one – computer-assisted shot in sight&quot;. Helen McCarthy in &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; claims that the anime &quot;remains fresh and exciting, easily holding its own against the products of two decades of massive technical advancement&quot;. Meanwhile, in February 2004, Dan Persons of &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; listed the film as one of the &quot;10 Essential Animations&quot;, simply referring to the film as &quot;the film that changed everything.&quot;

=== Awards ===
In 1992, &quot;Akira&quot; won the Silver Scream Award at the Amsterdam Fantastic Film Festival.

&quot;Akira&quot; was one of the four nominees for the 2007 American Anime Awards&#x27; &quot;Best Anime Feature&quot; award, but it lost to &quot;Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children&quot;.

=== Russia bans ===
In July 2021, the Oktyabrsky District Court in Saint Petersburg banned the film along with some &quot;Happy Tree Friends&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, based on anime, claiming that the film &quot;citing possible damage to children&#x27;s health and psychological development.&quot;

== Music ==

&quot;AKIRA: Original Soundtrack&quot; (&quot;Symphonic Suite AKIRA&quot;) was recorded by Geinoh Yamashirogumi (芸能山城組). The music was composed and conducted by musical director Shōji Yamashiro (pseudonym of Tsutomu Ōhashi), and performed by the collective Geinoh Yamashirogumi. The soundtrack draws heavily from traditional Indonesian gamelan music, in addition to elements of Japanese noh music.

It features music which was additionally re-recorded for release. &quot;Kaneda&quot;, &quot;Battle Against Clown&quot; and &quot;Exodus From the Underground Fortress&quot; are really part of the same song cycle – elements of &quot;Battle Against Clown&quot; can be heard during the opening bike sequence, for example. The score is generally sequenced in the same order that the music occurs in the film. The North American version featured extensive production notes by David Keith Riddick and Robert Napton.

&quot;AKIRA: The Original Japanese Soundtrack&quot;; an alternate soundtrack was also released. This version included music as it appeared in the film with dialogue and sound-effects albeit ordered out of sequence.

The soundtrack spawned an album of electronica remixes from Bwana, called &quot;Capsules Pride&quot;. Samples from the &quot;Akira&quot; soundtrack have also been featured in numerous other hip hop and electronic music tracks.

== Adaptations ==
=== Video games ===
In 1988, Taito released an &quot;Akira&quot; adventure game for the Famicom exclusively in Japan. Another &quot;Akira&quot; game for the Jaguar, Super NES, Genesis and Sega CD was being developed, but canceled along with prospects of another &quot;Akira&quot; title for the Game Boy and Game Gear handheld consoles. International Computer Entertainment produced a video game based on &quot;Akira&quot; for the Amiga and Amiga CD32 in 1994. To coincide with the DVD release in 2002, Bandai released &quot;Akira Psycho Ball&quot;, a pinball simulator for the PlayStation 2.

=== Live-action film ===
Since 2002, Warner Bros. acquired the rights to create a live-action remake of &quot;Akira&quot; as a seven-figure deal. The live-action remake has undergone several failed attempts to produce it, with at least five different directors and ten different writers known to have been attached to it. By 2017, director Taika Waititi was named as the film&#x27;s director for the live-action adaptation. Warner Bros. had scheduled the film for release on May 21, 2021, and filming was planned to start in California in July 2019. However, Warner Bros. put the work on indefinite hold just prior to filming as Waititi had chosen to first direct &quot;&quot;, the sequel to &quot;&quot;, which he had also directed.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Akira&quot; is widely regarded as one of the greatest animated movies of all time and prompted an increase in popularity of anime movies in the US and, generally, outside Japan. It is still admired for its exceptional visuals. In Channel 4&#x27;s 2005 poll of the 100 greatest animations of all time featuring both film and television, &quot;Akira&quot; came in at number 16. On &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest movies of all time, &quot;Akira&quot; is number 440. It showed again on &quot;Empire&quot;″s list of The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema, coming in at No. 51. IGN also named it 14th on its list of Top 25 Animated Movies of All-Time. The &quot;Akira&quot; anime also made &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of top 5 anime DVDs. The film also made number 16 on &quot;Time Out&quot;″s top 50 animated movie list and number 5 on the &quot;Total Film&quot; Top 50 Animated Films list. The film was ranked No. 1 by &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Anime&quot; magazine on their &quot;Top 50 Anime released in North America&quot; list in 2001. It was ranked No. 4 on &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; critic&#x27;s list of &quot;10 Best Animated Films for Adults&quot; in 2016. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; selected &quot;Akira&quot; as his &quot;Video Pick of the Week&quot; in 1992 on &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert and the Movies&quot;. For its wider 2001 release, he gave the film &quot;Thumbs Up&quot;.

&quot;Akira&quot; has also been regarded as one of the greatest action and science fiction films of all time. It was ranked number 22 on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of best sci-fi and fantasy films, included on Film4&#x27;s list of top 50 science fiction films, and ranked number 27 on &quot;Complex&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 50 best sci-fi movies. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; listed &quot;Akira&quot; as the fifth greatest action film of all time. Phelim O&#x27;Neill of the &quot;Guardian&quot; draws a parallel on &quot;Akira&quot;″s influence on the science-fiction genre to &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;Akira&quot; is considered a landmark film in the cyberpunk genre, particularly the Japanese cyberpunk subgenre. The British Film Institute describes &quot;Akira&quot; as a vital cornerstone of the cyberpunk genre, along with &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. Rob Garratt of &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; calls &quot;Akira&quot; one of &quot;the most influential sci-fi visions ever realised&quot; on film, comparable to the influence of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. &quot;Akira&quot; is also credited as a breakthrough for adult animation, proving to global audiences that animation was not just for children.

=== &quot;Akira&quot; slide ===
The &quot;&quot;Akira&quot; slide&quot; refers to a scene where Kaneda slides into view with his motorbike, as he uses a sideways slide to bring his bike to a halt, while the bike gives off a trail of smoke and electric sparks caused by the slide. It is regarded as one of the most iconic anime scenes of all time, widely imitated and referred to in many works of animation, film, and television.

=== Cultural influence ===
&quot;Akira&quot; is regarded by many critics as a landmark anime film, one that influenced much of the art in the anime world that followed its release with many illustrators in the manga industry citing the film as an important influence. Manga author Masashi Kishimoto, for example, recalls becoming fascinated with the way the poster was made and wished to imitate the series&#x27; creator Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s style. The film had a significant effect on popular culture worldwide. The film led the way for the growth in popularity of anime outside Japan as well as Japanese popular culture in the Western world. &quot;Akira&quot; is considered a forerunner of the second wave of anime fandom that began in the early 1990s and has gained a massive cult following since then. It is credited with setting the scene for anime franchises such as &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Naruto&quot; to become global cultural phenomena. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the &quot;cult 1988 anime taught western film-makers new ideas in storytelling, and helped cartoons grow up&quot;.

&quot;Akira&quot; has influenced numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television, and video games. It inspired a wave of Japanese cyberpunk works, including manga and anime series such as &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;, &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Devilman Crybaby&quot;, &quot;Gantz&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;, and &quot;Elfen Lied&quot;, live-action Japanese films such as &quot;&quot;, and video games such as Hideo Kojima&#x27;s &quot;Snatcher&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, and Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Outside of Japan, &quot;Akira&quot; has been cited as a major influence on Hollywood films such as &quot;The Matrix&quot;, &quot;Dark City&quot;, &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, &quot;Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Looper&quot;, &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, &quot;Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;Inception&quot;, &quot;Godzilla&quot;, &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, and &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot;, television shows such as &quot;Astronaut&quot;, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; and &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, and video games such as Core Design&#x27;s &quot;Switchblade&quot;, Valve&#x27;s &quot;Half-Life&quot; series, and Dontnod Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Remember Me&quot;. John Gaeta cited &quot;Akira&quot; as artistic inspiration for the bullet time effect in &quot;The Matrix&quot; films. &quot;Akira&quot; has also been credited with influencing the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, including the prequel film trilogy and the &quot;Clone Wars&quot; film and television series. Todd McFarlane cited &quot;Akira&quot; as an influence on HBO animated television series &quot;Spawn&quot;.

&quot;Akira&quot; has also influenced the work of musicians. The music video for the Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson song &quot;Scream&quot; (1995) features clips from &quot;Akira&quot;. Kanye West cited &quot;Akira&quot; as a major influence on his work, and he paid homage to the film in the &quot;Stronger&quot; (2007) music video. Lupe Fiasco&#x27;s album &quot;Tetsuo &amp; Youth&quot; (2015) is named after Tetsuo Shima. The popular bike from the film, Kaneda&#x27;s Motorbike, appears in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, and CD Projekt&#x27;s video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;. &quot;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided&quot; video game developer Eidos Montréal also paid homage to the film&#x27;s poster. The season four premiere of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; (&quot;Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat&quot;) features a scene in which Morty, and then Rick, are transformed into a giant tendrilled monster that Jerry and Beth later refer to as &quot;an Akira&quot;. The 2000 &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Trapper Keeper&quot; has references to &quot;Akira&quot;, such as one of the characters transforming into a giant blob organism before absorbing several other characters, not unlike the movie. The stage name of pornographic actress Asa Akira also comes from &quot;Akira&quot;. The music video for Grimes&#x27; &quot;Delete Forever&quot; pays homage to Tetsuo&#x27;s penultimate moments on the Olympic throne.

When Tokyo was chosen to host the 2020 Summer Olympics in the 2013 bidding process, several commentators claimed that &quot;Akira&quot; predicted the future event. In 2017, &quot;Akira&quot; was referred to in several Tokyo Olympic promotions. In February 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic and 147 days before the Olympics, a scene in &quot;Akira&quot; which calls for the cancellation of the 2020 Olympics or a graffiti stating &quot;Just Cancel It!&quot; (147 days before the event) led to a social media trend calling for the cancellation of the 2020 Olympics, where it topped Twitter topics in Japan. The Summer Olympics were eventually postponed to 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

<text>Age of Wonders is a 1999 turn-based strategy game co-developed by Triumph Studios and Epic MegaGames, and published by Gathering of Developers.

&quot;Age of Wonders&quot; underwent a long production cycle, and was originally developed under the name &quot;World of Wonders&quot;. In 1997, the team scrapped its existing work and restarted development, which resulted in &quot;Age of Wonders&quot;.

The game won positive reviews and was a moderate commercial success, with global sales of roughly 200,000 units by 2001. It began a franchise and was followed by five sequels: &quot;Age of Wonders II: The Wizard&#x27;s Throne&quot;, &quot;Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic&quot;, &quot;Age of Wonders III&quot;, &quot;Age of Wonders: Planetfall&quot;, and &quot;Age of Wonders 4&quot;. In 2010, the first game was re-released on GOG.com and Steam.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Age of Wonders&quot; is a turn-based strategy game that takes place from an isometric perspective, which consists of hexagonal tiles. Units are arranged into groups (also known as parties or stacks) of up to eight units; a single such group occupies one tile. Cities occupy between one and four tiles, and other structures generally occupy a single tile. Units within the game have a limited number of &quot;movement points&quot;, which are replenished at the beginning of each turn. Two turn systems are used - sequential (or &quot;classic&quot;), where players take their turns in order, or simultaneous, where all players can move units at once. In practice, actions in the latter system are added and executed via a queue.

The game has a single-player campaign, playable from two sides (more campaigns have been made by the community since release), and many maps, both included and user-created that can be played in Hotseat mode, over a LAN, on the Internet, or by email (PBEM). Up to 12 players can participate in a single game, depending on the map. Simultaneous turns are only available in single player and live multiplayer games; PBEM and hotseat games, and all combat, use the sequential turn system.

Each player leads a certain race. There are 12 races available in the game, though not all of them may be present on every map, and of those which are, not all may be playable. List of races includes traditional fantasy Elves, Lizardmen, Humans, Goblins, Dark Elves, Undead, Orcs, Dwarves and Halflings, as well as several unique ones such as Frostlings, Azracs, and Highmen. Races, as well as units not belonging to any specific race, such as dragons and giants, have a certain alignment, which can be good, neutral, or evil. According to their alignment and certain other factors, cities and independent units of one race can be friendly or hostile towards another race. This can manifest itself in different ways; for example, an orc city is not likely to surrender to the elves, and if conquered, may revolt unless there is a strong military presence in it to oppress the population. Units of hostile races forced to fight alongside each other in a single group will have lower morale, and are more likely to desert. Race relations can be improved by acts of goodwill towards other races, such as upgrading their cities, or hampered by razing, looting, or migrating cities belonging to that race. Diplomacy can also affect this and even an alliance with one race might affect the relation of another race. There are also several spells which have a global effect on race relations.

There are two resources, gold and mana. Gold is used to build units, buy heroes, cities and spells (in Wizard Towers), upgrade cities. Mana is used to cast and research spells and use altars. Units can be built in cities, which can be further upgraded to produce more advanced units. Also, wandering &quot;independent&quot; (not belonging to any player) groups of units can be hired, if they are well-disposed towards the player. Units may have different strength, reflected by their &quot;level&quot;, which can vary from 1 to 4. Units under player control require a certain amount of gold every turn as an &quot;upkeep&quot;, the size of which depends upon the level of the unit. Summoned units use mana for upkeep instead of gold. Units earn experience for killing other units. The amount of experience earned depends on the number of enemy units killed as well as their level - the level of the enemy killed is the amount of experience gained. Upon earning a certain amount of experience, the unit gets a &quot;silver&quot; medal, and later on a &quot;gold&quot; one. Higher level units require more experience to earn medals. Units with medals also get slight increases to their basic parameters, or otherwise improve their combat performance.

A special type of unit, a &quot;hero&quot;, can only be hired when they appear at random at one of the player&#x27;s cities. Heroes earn experience points just like all other units do; however, instead of getting medals for it, they gain &quot;levels&quot; to a maximum of level 30. Upon reaching the next level, they get a number of skill points, which a player can then spend to improve their parameters and teach them special abilities. This point system is similar to that used in many role-playing video games. In addition to that, heroes are the only units in the game which can learn the &quot;Spell Casting&quot; special ability, allowing them to cast spells. The &quot;Spell-Casting&quot; special ability can be upgraded from level I to level V. Each level provides more mana income/research points and also improves the &quot;channeling points&quot; allowing the hero to cast more/better spells each turn. Some spells require many turns to cast even with level V &quot;Spell-Casting&quot;. Heroes can not work together to cast one spell - each must cast it individually. Unlike common units, heroes can be brought from dead by magical means, although such experience will greatly decrease their morale.

Scattered across the board are a series of structures known as altars. These altars harness different types of magic and can be used as large-scale weapons. To fire off an altar, a player must first take control of it, then target a spot on the board (within a certain range), then click to cast the spell over the targeted area. Altars require 500 mana to fire. Each turn, they accumulate 50 mana charge, requiring 10 turns to fully recharge. Players with enough mana crystals may fire an altar multiple times sequentially without recharging.

Spells are divided into three types - unit spells which enhance a single unit, combat spells which are used to directly damage or handicap the enemy during combat, and global spells which can affect terrain, structures and groups of units on the global map, or summon magical creatures to player&#x27;s aid. All have different mana costs depending on how advanced they are, and some of the more powerful unit and global spells can take more than one turn to cast. Counterspells to block and dispel unit and global enchantments are also available. Each spell furthermore belongs to one of the eight spheres of magic: &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Death&quot;, &quot;Air&quot;, &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Cosmos&quot; and &quot;Secret&quot;/&quot;Chaos&quot;. Mana, the magical energy required to research and cast spells, is channeled from magic &quot;nodes&quot;. Some of those are generic, and provide equal (though small) amount to caster of any sphere. Others are linked to one of the elemental planes, and only channel a specific kind of energy; thus, a Fire node, for example, can only be used by a player who chose the Fire sphere. Heroes with &quot;Spell-Casting&quot; also generate mana, your King/Leader more so than others.

===Combat===
Combat is initiated by one player attempting to move a stack onto a hex occupied by another player. If the players are at war, the attacker has the option of selecting tactical combat, where the players move individual units on a small map representing the battlefield, or automatic (&quot;fast&quot;) combat, where the computer determines how the battle would have taken place by weighing off each side&#x27;s attack, defense and movement parameters. Tactical combat is only available on single player maps, against independent units in PBEM games, and (optionally) against human players in live multiplayer games. Both forms of combat use the sequential turn system.

Spells may be cast during combat, though global spells are disabled. Combat spells may target a unit or a group of units of the enemy collectively, damaging or temporarily handicapping them. Handicaps are usually introduced alongside direct damage, and vary from short-term paralysis to poisoning or a curse. Most spells have a maximum range. All ranged attacks (including some types of spells), and some melee strikes can result in friendly fire. For example, an archer firing an arrow at a target can hit and injure a friendly unit if it is on the line of fire. Trees, buildings and other obstacles scattered around combat maps also hamper ranged attacks as well as movement to various degrees, and can be used to one&#x27;s advantage to great effect.

Unit parameters and special abilities play a heavy role in combat. &quot;Attack&quot; is matched against target&#x27;s &quot;defence&quot; to determine whether a hit was scored, and then &quot;damage&quot; determined the number of hit points the target loses. Some offensive spells have to beat the target&#x27;s &quot;resistance&quot; instead, or even both &quot;defence&quot; and &quot;resistance&quot;. Physical attacks (such as &quot;archery&quot;) target defence, while other attacks (such as &quot;venomous spit&quot;) target resistance. Equal values of the attacker and the defender parameters results in a 50% chance to hit, and for each point of difference this is changed by 10% (but to a minimum of 10%, or a maximum of 90%). While most commonly only physical damage is dealt, sometimes attacks are partially or fully magical in nature, and can result in additional negative effects on the target: a fire strike has a chance of setting the target aflame, a lightning strike can paralyse the target, and so on. At the same time, units often have protection and/or immunity against specific forms of attacks. Protection reduces the damage of that effect by 50% e.g. &quot;lightning bolts&quot; with &quot;marksmanship II&quot; (a skill to improve attack/damage of a ranged attack) has 7 attack 4 damage, but would do a maximum of 2 damage against a unit with &quot;lightning protection&quot;, and none against a unit with &quot;lightning immunity&quot;.

==Development==
&quot;Age of Wonders&quot; underwent a long development cycle. &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot;″s Mark Asher joked that it had &quot;been in development ever since programming a computer was a matter of punching holes in cards&quot;. It was originally developed under the name &quot;World of Wonders&quot; for MS-DOS, and was later upgraded for Windows 95. The team ultimately scrapped this version of the game in 1997, leading to the final released version of &quot;Age of Wonders&quot;. The game originally incorporated several role-playing video game elements that were dropped when simultaneous turns were implemented.

The music files within Age of Wonders are in Impulse Tracker (.IT) format and were composed by Michiel van den Bos, who has also composed for other notable titles such as &quot;Deus Ex&quot; and the &quot;Unreal&quot; series of games. There are 20 tunes in the main gameplay, and also 4 other tunes to accompany different situations within gameplay. The 21st tune called &quot;In The Company of Elves&quot; was included with the demo version of &quot;Age of Wonders&quot;, but not with the final release of the game. In the demo version all songs beside the title song were in the Scream Tracker (.s3m) format.

== Reception ==
The game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. &quot;IGN&quot; reviewer Jason Bates wrote, &quot;if you are at all interested in turn-based strategy games with a fantasy theme, go get this game&quot;. Bates praised many of the game&#x27;s features including the graphics, gameplay mechanics, editor, and online connectivity, but said the music was uninspiring and called the sound effects &quot;serviceable but bland&quot;. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Nick Woods wrote: &quot;If you love strategy and role playing games, &quot;Age of Wonders&quot; is worth the purchase&quot;, giving it three-and-a-half stars out of five. However, &quot;GameZone&quot;″s Jason Lambert gave it 6.3 out of 10, writing: &quot;Small flaws and annoyances made this game a little less than expected. If you are wanting to play something different than the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot;, &quot;Warlords&quot;, or the new &quot;&quot;, then you may want to try this game. If you are happy with what you are currently playing, then save your money and buy your mom a Christmas present&quot;. Greg Vederman of &quot;NextGen&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Age of Wonders&quot; stands tall as one of the best games of the year&quot;.

Domestically, the game sold 20,975 copies by April 2000, and totaled 71,000 copies by October 2001. Its global sales had reached roughly 200,000 units by March 2001. At the time, &quot;PC Player&quot; noted that &quot;Age of Wonders&quot; was &quot;not necessarily one of the biggest sellers in gaming history&quot;, but that its commercial performance was adequate to justify a sequel.

&quot;PC Gamer US&quot; and &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot; nominated the game for their 1999 &quot;Best Turn-Based Strategy Game&quot; awards, both of which ultimately went to &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;. The staff wrote that the former game &quot;took the tired fantasy-based theme we&#x27;ve seen time and again and breathed new life into it&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Age of Wonders&quot; began the &quot;Age of Wonders&quot; series. It was followed by five sequels: &quot;Age of Wonders II: The Wizard&#x27;s Throne&quot;, &quot;Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic&quot;, &quot;Age of Wonders III&quot;, &quot;Age of Wonders: Planetfall&quot; and &quot;Age of Wonders 4&quot;.

===Modding===
The &quot;Age of Wonders&quot; came with a basic map editing utility &quot;AoWEd&quot;, that allows players to create their own scenarios or to edit existing scenarios included in the game. Scenario makers (also referred to as &#x27;mapmakers&#x27;) were able to draw maps with rich stories from their own imaginations, or took inspiration from classic fantasy worlds such as that of Tolkien, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, etc. Many of such carefully crafted scenarios have been touted as being of higher quality than that which came with the game. Having scenario makers actively utilising the AoWEd to make new scenarios meant that players were almost never in short supply of new maps to try out and enjoy. Custom made scenarios were also often used in multiplayer / PBEM tournaments. Thus, the AoWEd was largely responsible for keeping the fans of the game entertained until the release of the sequel, &quot;Age of Wonders 2&quot;.

The AoWEd was also used to generate the maps for the free online multiplayer game &quot;Battlemaster&quot;. The first mod released was known as &quot;Warlock&#x27;s Ruleset&quot;, after the player who created it. The mod changed some in-game costs and added new units and structures. Since the accidental release of the developer&#x27;s editor (known as DevEd), many more mods have been made by the fan community (notably at HeavenGames), including the very popular &quot;Lighthawk&#x27;s Rules&quot;. However, there are some aspects of the game that can only be changed by use of a hex editor.

<doc id="605942" wikidata="Q10270157" url="?curid=605942" title="New towns in the United Kingdom">
<text>The new towns in the United Kingdom were planned under the powers of the New Towns Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. 68) and later acts to relocate people from poor or bombed-out housing following the Second World War. Designated new towns were placed under the supervision of a development corporation, and were developed in three waves. Later developments included the &#x27;expanded towns&#x27;: existing towns which were substantially expanded to accommodate what was called the &quot;overspill&quot; population from densely populated areas of deprivation.

==Historical precedents==
===Garden cities===

The concept of the &quot;garden city&quot; was first envisaged by Ebenezer Howard in his 1898 book &quot;To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform&quot;, as an alternative to the pollution and overcrowding in Britain&#x27;s growing urban areas. Taking inspiration from the model villages of Port Sunlight and Bournville, he saw garden cities as the &quot;joyous union&quot; of town and country, providing a much better quality of life for those who lived there.

Two garden cities were built Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1903, and Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire in 1920.

The underlying principles of garden cities (including community engagement, well designed housing, easily accessible recreational and shopping facilities, and an integrated transport network) were influential in the development of the post-war new towns movement.

===Overspill estates===

An &quot;overspill estate&quot; is a housing estate planned and built for the housing of excess population in urban areas, both from the natural increase of population and often in order to rehouse people from decaying inner city areas, usually as part of the process of slum clearance. They were created on the outskirts of most large British towns and during most of the 20th century, with new towns being an alternative approach outside London after World War II. The objective of this was to bring more economic activity to these smaller communities, whilst relieving pressure on overpopulated areas of major cities.
* London County Council built housing developments affixed to towns outside its jurisdiction, of which Becontree, Dagenham (which became part of Greater London in 1965) was the largest. It was built in the 1920s and 1930s.
* Seacroft in Leeds was built from 1934 when Leeds City Council bought 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) for municipal housing. Most houses and blocks of flats were built after World War II. The council had planned for Seacroft to be a &quot;satellite town within the city boundary&quot; 
* Wythenshawe was built on former rural land in the north of Cheshire between the 1920s and early 1970s to rehouse families from the inner city slums of Manchester as an overspill estate. Other Manchester overspill estates include Hattersley (mostly built during the 1960s), Gamesley, and Haughton Green.
* Castlemilk, Drumchapel, Easterhouse and Pollok in Glasgow.
* Castle Vale in Birmingham, which was built in the 1960s in the extreme north-east of the city.

== List of new towns ==

=== England ===

==== First wave ====

The first wave of independent new towns was intended to help alleviate the housing shortages following the Second World War, beyond the green belt around London. Two sites in County Durham were also designated. These designations were made under the New Towns Act 1946 (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 6. c. 68).
* Stevenage, Hertfordshire (designated 11 November 1946)
* Crawley, Sussex (designated 9 January 1947)
* Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire (designated 4 February 1947)
* Harlow, Essex (designated 25 March 1947)
* Newton Aycliffe, County Durham (designated 19 April 1947 as Aycliffe New Town)
* Peterlee, County Durham (designated 10 March 1948, as Easington New Town)
* Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield, Hertfordshire (both designated 20 May 1948)
* Basildon, Essex (designated 4 January 1949)
* Bracknell, Berkshire (designated 17 June 1949)
* Corby, Northamptonshire (designated 1 April 1950)

==== Second wave ====
The second wave (1961–1964) was likewise initiated to alleviate housing shortfalls. Two of the locations below (Redditch and Dawley New Townlater renamed Telford) are near the West Midlands conurbation and were designed for Birmingham and Wolverhampton overspill; another two (Runcorn and Skelmersdale) are near Merseyside and were intended as overspill for the city of Liverpool.

* Skelmersdale, Lancashire (designated 9 October 1961)
* Dawley New Town, Shropshire (designated 16 January 1963)
* Redditch, Worcestershire (designated 10 April 1964)
* Runcorn, Cheshire (designated 10 April 1964)
* Washington, Tyne and Wear (designated 24 July 1964)

==== Third wave ====
The third wave of new towns (1967–1970) allowed for additional growth, chiefly further north from the previous London new towns, among them &quot;Central Lancashire New Town&quot; and Warrington. Dawley New Town was redesignated as Telford New Town, with a much larger area, as overspill for Birmingham and nearby towns including Wolverhampton. With a target population of 250,000 and a planning brief to become the first &quot;new city&quot;, the largest of these was Milton Keynes at the northern edge of the South East, about halfway between Birmingham and London. In the East Midlands, the existing town of Northampton was expanded. The city of Peterborough was designated as a new town to accommodate overspill from London.

* Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire (designated 23 January 1967)
* Peterborough, Cambridgeshire (designated 21 July 1967)
* Northampton, Northamptonshire (designated 14 February 1968)
* Warrington, Cheshire (designated 26 April 1968), resulting in the Birchwood development
* Telford, Shropshire (designated 29 November 1968)
* Central Lancashire New Town, Lancashire (designated 26 March 1970), which covered a conurbation focused on the towns of Preston, Chorley and Leyland, and expanded Clayton-le-Woods into a larger urban area with the Clayton Brook development. Its area also included what are today large towns or villages, albeit they were smaller at the time of the new town designation: Bamber Bridge, Coppull, Penwortham and Euxton. It was initially planned to adjoin these areas into one city, with the name Redrose suggested, but after years of dissatisfaction with its progress amongst locals and politicians, its Development Corporation was ultimately disbanded in 1985 by the Thatcher government. Central Lancashire was retrospectively described as &quot;more akin to an Urban Development Corporation&quot; and &quot;never intended to be recognised as a new town in its own right&quot;.

==== Yate and South Woodham Ferrers ====
Yate in Gloucestershire and South Woodham Ferrers in Essex were developed between the 1950s and 1970s, coinciding with the creation of the above new towns, and Yate pointedly marketed itself as a &quot;new town&quot; during the 1960s. However, they differ in that they were not commissioned by any of the New Town Acts.

=== Wales ===
* Cwmbran, Torfaen (designated 4 November 1949)
* Newtown, Powys (designated 18 December 1967)
* Coedffranc (Currently expanding)

=== Scotland ===
Six new towns in Scotland were designated between 1947 and 1973, mostly for the overspill population of Glasgow.

* East Kilbride (designated 6 May 1947)
* Glenrothes (designated 30 June 1948)
* Cumbernauld (designated 9 December 1955, extended 19 March 1973)
* Livingston (designated 16 April 1962)
* Irvine (designated 9 November 1966, and encompassing the existing settlement of Kilwinning)
* Stonehouse (designated 17 July 1973, de-designated in 1976 after fewer than 100 houses had been built)

==== Other major developments ====
* Blindwells: new settlement under construction between Tranent and Port Seton in East Lothian
* Chapelton of Elsick (in progress)
* Countesswells: partially constructed new settlement west of Aberdeen between Cults and Kingswells
* Dalgety Bay: a new town developed in the 1970s and 1980s in Fife
* Dargavel: new town being built on former BAE munitions works site adjacent to Bishopton in Renfrewshire 
* Erskine and Inchinnan, new town developed in the 1970s and 1980s in Renfrewshire, initially by the Scottish Special Housing Association
* Ravenscraig: former steelworks site in North Lanarkshire (in progress)
* Shawfair: new settlement under construction in south-east Edinburgh spanning the City of Edinburgh Council and Midlothian Council administrative boundaries
* Tornagrain: a new town near Inverness (in progress)
* Tweedbank: village built in the 1970s on a greenfield site in the central Scottish Borders, initially by a government body, the Scottish Special Housing Association
* Winchburgh, West Lothian. Expansion from village to a new town.

==== Future developments ====
* Forestmill: new settlement proposed in Clackmannanshire in close proximity to the Fife Council administrative boundary
* Owenstown: new settlement proposed in the South Lanarkshire area to the south of Lanark

=== Northern Ireland ===
The New Towns Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 gave the Minister of Development of the Government of Northern Ireland the power to designate an area as a new town, and to appoint a development commission. An order could be made to transfer municipal functions of all or part of any existing local authorities to the commission, which took the additional title of urban district council, although unelected. This was done in the case of Craigavon.

The New Towns Amendment Act 1968 was passed to enable the establishment of the Londonderry Development Commission to replace the County Borough and rural district of Londonderry, and implement the Londonderry Area Plan. On 3 April 1969, the development commission took over the municipal functions of the two councils, the area becoming Londonderry Urban District.

* Craigavon (designated 26 July 1965)
* Antrim (designated 1966)
* Ballymena (designated 1967)
* Derry (designated 5 February 1969) 

==Other &#x27;overspill&#x27; developments==
During the same period as the new town scheme, several other towns underwent local authority led expansion as &#x27;overspills&#x27; to larger urban areas, but were not officially designated as new towns, among these were:
*Cramlington, Northumberland – Newcastle
*Daventry, Northamptonshire – Birmingham
*Hattersley, Tameside – Manchester Corporation
*Killingworth, Tyne and Wear – Newcastle
*Kirkby, Merseyside – Liverpool
*Tamworth, Staffordshire – Birmingham
*Winsford, Cheshire – Liverpool &amp; Manchester
*Stockbridge Village, Merseyside – Liverpool
*Gamesley, Derbyshire – Manchester

==Subsequent town expansion schemes==
No new towns have been designated under the New Towns Act in England since 1970 (and Scotland since 1973), but several new large scale developments have been founded:

* Ingleby Barwick, North Yorkshire
* Bradley Stoke, Gloucestershire
* Chafford Hundred, Grays, Essex
* Cambourne, Cambridgeshire
* Bar Hill, Cambridgeshire
* Ebbsfleet, Kent 
* Heath Hayes and Wimblebury, Staffordshire
* Withymoor Village, West Midlands
* Haxby, North Yorkshire
* Hilton, Derbyshire
* Kings Hill, Kent
* Wixams, Bedfordshire
* Sherford, Devon
* Northstowe, Cambridgeshire
* Cranbrook, Devon
* Whiteley, Hampshire
* Valley Park, Hampshire
* Arborfield Green, Berkshire
* Waverley, South Yorkshire
* Fairham, Nottinghamshire
* Manydown, Hampshire
* Aylesham Garden Village, Kent
* Broadnook Garden Village, Leicestershire
* Buckover Garden Village, Gloucestershire
* Langarth Garden Village, Cornwall
* West Carclaze Garden Village, Cornwall
* Ledsham Garden Village, Cheshire
* Newton Garden Village, Nottinghamshire
* Daresbury Garden Village, Cheshire
* Woodford Garden Village, Greater Manchester
* Halsnead Garden Village, Merseyside
* Long Marston Garden Village, Warwickshire
* Longcross Garden Village, Surrey
* Berinsfield Garden Village, Oxfordshire
* Wynyard Garden Village, County Durham
* Godley Green Garden Village, Greater Manchester
* Nansledan, Newquay, Cornwall
* Welborne, Hampshire
* Maltkiln, North Yorkshire
* Otterpool Park, Kent

Poundbury is an experimental new town or urban extension on the outskirts of Dorchester. The development is built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. It is built according to the principles of (then) Prince Charles, who was known for holding strong views challenging the post-war trends in town planning that were suburban in character.

Euxton has grown significantly following the Buckshaw Village development, described as &quot;one of the largest brownfield schemes of its kind throughout Europe&quot;, and conceptualised as an eco-village. Further expansion is planned with another development, Euxton Heights. Although Euxton falls under what were the designated boundaries of Central Lancashire New Town, the decision to proceed with these developments is unrelated.

===Future developments===
On 13 May 2007, chancellor Gordon Brown, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom the following month, announced he would designate 10 new &quot;eco-towns&quot; to ease demand for low-cost housing. The towns, around 20,000 population each—at least 5,000 homes—are planned to be &quot;carbon neutral&quot; and will use locally generated sustainable-energy sources. Only one site was identified in the announcement: the former Oakington Barracks in Cambridgeshire, which is the site of the already-planned Northstowe development. Local councils will be invited to provide sites for the remaining four towns.

In September 2014, the CBI called for all political parties to commit to building 10 new towns and garden cities to get to grips with the country&#x27;s housing shortage.

South East Faversham, a new settlement proposed by the Duchy of Cornwall adjacent to the M2 in Kent, was expected to undergo the planning process in 2023.

In January 2017, the government announced proposed areas across England in which funding has been allocated for &quot;garden villages&quot;, some of these being extensions of existing towns, others planned urbanisation of rural villages or outright new settlements. Meanwhile, that some towns would receive new-build homes after acquiring &quot;garden town&quot; status. Garden towns and garden villages have been described as putting an emphasis on &quot;funding for garden communities&quot;, &quot;putting green, wildlife friendly spaces at the heart of development&quot;, and &quot;modern market towns with a focus on mixed use&quot; (despite the use of &quot;village&quot; in some of their titles, as opposed to town). Around the time of the announcement, fourteen of the proposed sites for these garden villages were covered in the press, some of which have been cancelled since. Didcot, Oxfordshire was one of the first to be awarded garden town status in 2015. Amongst the towns expected to see the most dynamic population growth after developments are Didcot, Harlow and Gilston as part of a joint garden town project, Taunton and Cullompton.

== Finance ==

The financial model was for many years as follows: an area of countryside was designated as a new town under the act; land was bought from the owners at agricultural prices; the government borrowed to invest in housing, commercial premises, and supporting infrastructure such as sewers, schools, churches or open spaces; and in due course it sold off the commercial premises and part of the housing at developed prices, thus paying off the debt. This model ran into some difficulty in the 1970s as growing inflation increased the cost of new borrowing, and this complicated the impact of the programme on public finances. The corporations were in due course dissolved and their assets split between local authorities and, in England, the Commission for New Towns (later English Partnerships).

==Legacy==
In July 2002, the Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions assessed the effectiveness of the new towns and concluded that:

While many New Towns have been economically successful, most now are experiencing major problems. Their design is inappropriate to the 21st Century. Their infrastructure is ageing at the same rate and many have social and economic problems. Many are small local authorities which do not have the capacity to resolve their problems. Their attempts to manage the towns are complicated by the role played by English Partnerships which still has major landholdings and other outstanding interests.

and:

The new towns are no longer new and many of the quickly built houses have reached the end of their design life. The masterplans dictated low density development with large amounts of open space, and housing segregated from jobs, shopping and business services. These created a car dependency and are now not considered sustainable. Low density developments are expensive to maintain. Roads and sewers are in need of expensive upgrades.

The lack of social ties experienced by some residents of the new towns has given rise to the notion of &quot;new town blues&quot;.

<text>The red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata) is a dove that is widespread and common in Sub-Saharan Africa. It has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2004.

==Taxonomy==
The red-eyed dove was formally described by the German naturalist Eduard Rüppell in 1835 from birds seen in the Taranta Mountains of Eritrea. He coined the binomial name &quot;Columba semitorquata&quot;. The specific epithet is combines the Latin &quot;semi-&quot; meaning &quot;half-&quot; or &quot;small&quot; and &quot;torquatus&quot; meaning &quot;collared&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The red-eyed dove is a largish, stocky pigeon, typically in length. Its back, wings and tail are pale brown. When flying, it shows blackish flight feathers. The head and underparts are dark vinous-pink, shading to pale grey on the face. There is a black hind neck patch edged with white. The legs and a patch of bare skin around the eye are red. The call is a loud &quot;doo-doo-du-du&quot;.

Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults and have scalloping on the body feathers.

Red-eyed doves eat grass seeds, grains and other vegetation. They often forage on the ground.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is distributed through most of sub-Saharan Africa, except in desert zones. 
It is a common, if not abundant, species in most habitats other than deserts. Like several other species in this genus, they are not particularly gregarious and often feed alone or in pairs. They can be found in forests near rivers.

==Behaviour==
This species builds a stick nest in a tree and lays two white eggs. Its flight is quick, with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings, which are characteristic of pigeons in general.

<doc id="605986" wikidata="Q705636" url="?curid=605986" title="Frank L. Culbertson Jr.">
<text>Frank Lee Culbertson Jr. (born May 15, 1949) (Capt, USN, Ret.) is an American former naval officer and aviator, test pilot, aerospace engineer, NASA astronaut, graduate of the US Naval Academy, and member of the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame. He served as the commander of the International Space Station for almost four months in 2001 and was the only U.S. citizen not on Earth when the September 11 attacks occurred.

Culbertson retired as President of the Space Systems Group at Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, where he was responsible for the execution, business development, and financial performance of the company&#x27;s human spaceflight, science, commercial communications, and national security satellite activities, as well as technical services to various government customers. These include some of Northrop Grumman&#x27;s largest programs such as NASA&#x27;s Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) initiatives to the International Space Station (ISS) as well as various national security-related programs.

==Early life==
Culbertson was born on May 15, 1949, in Charleston, South Carolina, but considers Holly Hill, South Carolina, to be his hometown. He has five children and nine grandchildren.

Culbertson was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of Second Class. He graduated from Holly Hill High School in 1967, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from the United States Naval Academy in 1971. He was a member of varsity rowing and wrestling teams at U.S. Naval Academy.

==United States Navy service==
Upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1971, Culbertson served aboard in the Gulf of Tonkin prior to reporting to flight training in Pensacola, Florida.

After designation as a Naval Aviator at Beeville, Texas, in May 1973, he flew F-4 Phantom aircraft with VF-121 at NAS Miramar, California; with VF-151 aboard the aircraft carrier , permanently homeported in Yokosuka, Japan; and with the U.S. Air Force in the 426th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where he served as Weapons and Tactics Instructor. Culbertson then served as the Catapult and Arresting Gear Officer for until May 1981 when he was selected to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, NAS Patuxent River, Maryland.

Following graduation with distinction in June 1982, he was assigned to the Carrier Systems Branch of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate where he served as Program Manager for all F-4 testing and as a test pilot for automatic carrier landing system tests and carrier suitability. He was engaged in fleet replacement training in the F-14 Tomcat at VF-101, NAS Oceana, Virginia, from January 1984 until his selection for the astronaut candidate program.

He has logged over 8,900 hours flying time in 55 different types of aircraft, and has made 450 carrier landings, including over 350 arrested landings, and numerous tests of the Automated Carrier Landing System.

==NASA career==
Selected as a NASA astronaut candidate in May 1984, Culbertson completed basic astronaut training in June 1985. Technical assignments since then included: member of the team that redesigned and tested the Space Shuttle nosewheel steering, tires, and brakes; member of the launch support team at Kennedy Space Center for Shuttle flights STS-61-A, STS-61-B, STS-61-C, and STS-51-L; in 1986 he worked at the NASA Headquarters Action Center in Washington, D.C., assisting with the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident investigations conducted by NASA, the Presidential Commission, and U.S. Congress.

He became lead astronaut at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); lead of the First Emergency Egress Team; and lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in the Mission Control Center for seven missions (STS-27, STS-29, STS-30, STS-28, STS-34, STS-33, and STS-32 [note that Shuttle missions are not ordered chronologically]). Following his first flight, he served as the Deputy Chief of the Flight Crew Operations Space Station Support Office, as well as the lead astronaut for Space Station Safety. He was also a member of the team evaluating the hardware and procedures for the proposed mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. Following STS-51, Culbertson was Chief of the Astronaut Office Mission Support Branch; then Chief of the Johnson Space Center Russian Projects Office. In 1994, Culbertson was named Deputy Program Manager, Phase 1 Shuttle-Mir, and in 1995 became Manager of the Shuttle-Mir Program. He was responsible for a multi-national team which executed nine Shuttle docking missions to the Russian Space Station Mir, with seven astronauts spending 30 months cumulatively on board the Mir Station, plus all the associated science and docking hardware to ensure the success of the joint program, a precursor to the building of the joint International Space Station. Just prior to his current flight assignment, Culbertson spent one year as Deputy Program Manager for Operations of the International Space Station Program.

===Spaceflight experience===

A veteran of three space flights, Culbertson has logged over 146 days in space .

STS-38 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (November 15–20, 1990) was a five-day mission during which the crew conducted Department of Defense operations. The mission concluded after 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, 54 minutes, 28 seconds, the first Shuttle to land in Florida since 1985.

STS-51 &quot;Discovery&quot; (September 12–22, 1993) was a ten-day mission during which the crew deployed the U.S. Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS/TOS), and the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (ORFEUS/SPAS) carrying U.S. and German scientific experiments, including an ultraviolet spectrometer. A seven-hour EVA was also conducted to evaluate Hubble Space Telescope repair tools and methods. After the SPAS spacecraft had completed six days of free flight some 40 miles from &quot;Discovery&quot;, the crew completed a successful rendezvous and recovered the SPAS with the Shuttle&#x27;s robot arm. The mission concluded with the first night landing of the Shuttle at the Kennedy Space Center. Mission duration was 158 Earth orbits in 236 hours and 11 minutes.

The Expedition 3 crew launched on August 10, 2001, aboard STS-105 &quot;Discovery&quot; and docked with the International Space Station on August 12, 2001. Culbertson lived and worked aboard the station for a total of 129 days, and was in command of the station for 117 days. He was the only American not to be on Earth during the September 11 attacks. As the ISS passed over the New York City area after the attacks, Culbertson took photographs of the smoke emanating from Ground Zero in lower Manhattan. He later learned that the plane that struck the Pentagon had been piloted (at takeoff) by his Naval Academy classmate Charles Burlingame. The two had been aeronautical engineering majors together, and had both gone on to become F-4 fighter pilots. Culbertson had his trumpet onboard ISS, and with their Academy class having their 30th reunion, he played taps, which he felt was especially fitting in that the two had also played in the academy&#x27;s Drum &amp; Bugle Corps together. The Expedition 3 crew left the station on December 15 aboard STS-108 &quot;Endeavour&quot;, landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on December 17, 2001.

==Organizations==

He is a member of a number of organisations, including the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (senior fellow), the Association of Naval Aviators, the Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Association, the Aviation Boatswains Mates Association, and the Association of Space Explorers.

==Awards and honors==
Culbertson has received numerous awards, including the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, NASA Space Flight Medals, Navy Commendation Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, and various other unit and service awards. Distinguished graduate, U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. He has been awarded Honorary Doctor of Science Degrees from the College of Charleston, 1994, and Lander University, 1999; he has also been awarded the Komarov Certificate for Space Flight Achievement, 1994, the AAS Flight Achievement Award for STS-51, 1994, &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; 1997 Laurel for Achievement in Space, IEEE/ASME Award for Manager of the Year, 1997, and the Space Center Rotary Club Stellar Award for 1998. Inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2010 and the South Carolina Aviation Hall of Fame in 1997. Designated a Fellow of AIAA in 2013.

<text>Papillomaviridae is a family of non-enveloped DNA viruses whose members are known as papillomaviruses. Several hundred species of papillomaviruses, traditionally referred to as &quot;types&quot;, have been identified infecting all carefully inspected mammals, but also other vertebrates such as birds, snakes, turtles and fish. Infection by most papillomavirus types, depending on the type, is either asymptomatic (e.g. most Beta-PVs) or causes small benign tumors, known as papillomas or warts (e.g. human papillomavirus 1, HPV6 or HPV11). Papillomas caused by some types, however, such as human papillomaviruses 16 and 18, carry a risk of becoming cancerous.

Papillomaviruses are usually considered as highly host- and tissue-tropic, and are thought to rarely be transmitted between species. Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in the basal layer of the body surface tissues. All known papillomavirus types infect a particular body surface, typically the skin or mucosal epithelium of the genitals, anus, mouth, or airways. For example, human papillomavirus (HPV) type 1 tends to infect the soles of the feet, and HPV type 2 the palms of the hands, where they may cause warts. Additionally, there are descriptions of the presence of papillomavirus DNA in the blood and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Papillomaviruses were first identified in the early 20th century, when it was shown that skin warts, or papillomas, could be transmitted between individuals by a filterable infectious agent. In 1935 Francis Peyton Rous, who had previously demonstrated the existence of a cancer-causing sarcoma virus in chickens, went on to show that a papillomavirus could cause skin cancer in infected rabbits. This was the first demonstration that a virus could cause cancer in mammals.

==Taxonomy of papillomaviruses==
There are over 100 species of papillomavirus recognised, though the ICTV officially recognizes a smaller number, categorized into 53 genera, as of 2019. All papillomaviruses (PVs) have similar genomic organizations, and any pair of PVs contains at least five homologous genes, although the nucleotide sequence may diverge by more than 50%. Phylogenetic algorithms that permit the comparison of homologies led to phylogenetic trees that have a similar topology, independent of the gene analyzed.

Phylogenetic studies strongly suggest that PVs normally evolve together with their mammalian and bird host species, but adaptive radiations, occasional zoonotic events and recombinations may also impact their diversification. Their basic genomic organization appears maintained for a period exceeding 100 million years, and these sequence comparisons have laid the foundation for a PV taxonomy, which is now officially recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. All PVs form the family &quot;Papillomaviridae&quot;, which is distinct from the &quot;Polyomaviridae&quot; thus eliminating the term &quot;Papovaviridae&quot;. Major branches of the phylogenetic tree of PVs are considered genera, which are identified by Greek letters. Minor branches are considered species and unite PV types that are genomically distinct without exhibiting known biological differences. This new taxonomic system does not affect the traditional identification and characterization of PV &quot;types&quot; and their independent isolates with minor genomic differences, referred to as &quot;subtypes&quot; and &quot;variants&quot;, all of which are taxa below the level of &quot;species&quot;. Additionally, phylogenetic groupings at higher taxonomic level have been proposed.

This classification may need revision in the light of the existence of papilloma–polyoma virus recombinants. Additional species have also been described. Sparus aurata papillomavirus 1 has been isolated from fish.

==Human papillomaviruses==

Over 170 human papillomavirus types have been completely sequenced. They have been divided into 5 genera: Alphapapillomavirus, Betapapillomavirus, Gammapapillomavirus, Mupapillomavirus and Nupapillomavirus. At least 200 additional viruses have been identified that await sequencing and classification.

==Animal papillomaviruses==

Individual papillomavirus types tend to be highly adapted to replication in a single animal species. In one study, researchers swabbed the forehead skin of a variety of zoo animals and used PCR to amplify any papillomavirus DNA that might be present. Although a wide variety of papillomavirus sequences were identified in the study, the authors found little evidence for inter-species transmission. One zookeeper was found to be transiently positive for a chimpanzee-specific papillomavirus sequence. However, the authors note that the chimpanzee-specific papillomavirus sequence could have been the result of surface contamination of the zookeeper&#x27;s skin, as opposed to productive infection.

Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) can cause protuberant warts in its native host, the North American rabbit genus &quot;Sylvilagus&quot;. These horn-like warts may be the original basis for the urban legends of the American antlered rabbit the Jackalope and European &quot;Wolpertinger&quot;. European domestic rabbits (genus &quot;Oryctolagus&quot;) can be transiently infected with CRPV in a laboratory setting. However, since European domestic rabbits do not produce infectious progeny virus, they are considered an incidental or &quot;dead-end&quot; host for CRPV.

Inter-species transmission has also been documented for bovine papillomavirus (BPV) type 1. In its natural host (cattle), BPV-1 induces large fibrous skin warts. BPV-1 infection of horses, which are an incidental host for the virus, can lead to the development of benign tumors known as sarcoids. The agricultural significance of BPV-1 spurred a successful effort to develop a vaccine against the virus.

A few reports have identified papillomaviruses in smaller rodents, such as Syrian hamsters, the African multimammate rat and the Eurasian harvest mouse. However, there are no papillomaviruses known to be capable of infecting laboratory mice. The lack of a tractable mouse model for papillomavirus infection has been a major limitation for laboratory investigation of papillomaviruses.

Four papillomaviruses are known to infect birds: Fringilla coelebs papillomavirus 1, Francolinus leucoscepus papillomavirus 1, Psittacus erithacus papillomavirus 1 and Pygoscelis adeliae papillomavirus 1. All these species have a gene (E9) of unknown function, suggesting a common origin.

==Evolution==
The evolution of papillomaviruses is thought to be slow compared to many other virus types, but there are no experimental measurements currently available. This is probably because the papillomavirus genome is composed of genetically stable double-stranded DNA that is replicated with high fidelity by the host cell&#x27;s DNA replication machinery.

It is believed that papillomaviruses generally co-evolve with a particular species of host animal over many years, although there are strong evidences against the hypothesis of coevolution. In a particularly speedy example, HPV-16 has evolved slightly as human populations have expanded across the globe and now varies in different geographic regions in a way that probably reflects the history of human migration. Cutaneotropic HPV types are occasionally exchanged between family members during the entire lifetime, but other donors should also be considered in viral transmission.

Other HPV types, such as HPV-13, vary relatively little in different human populations. In fact, the sequence of HPV-13 closely resembles a papillomavirus of bonobos (also known as pygmy chimpanzees). It is not clear whether this similarity is due to recent transmission between species or because HPV-13 has simply changed very little in the six or so million years since humans and bonobos diverged.

The most recent common ancestor of this group of viruses has been estimated to have existed .

There are five main genera infecting humans (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Mu and Nu). The most recent common ancestor of these genera evolved -. The most recent ancestor of the gamma genus was estimated to have evolved between and .

== Structure ==

Papillomaviruses are non-enveloped, meaning that the outer shell or capsid of the virus is not covered by a lipid membrane. A single viral protein, known as L1, is necessary and sufficient for formation of a 55–60 nanometer capsid composed of 72 star-shaped capsomers (see figure). Like most non-enveloped viruses, the capsid is geometrically regular and presents icosahedral symmetry. Self-assembled virus-like particles composed of L1 are the basis of a successful group of prophylactic HPV vaccines designed to elicit virus-neutralizing antibodies that protect against initial HPV infection. As such, papillomaviridæ are stable in the environment.

The papillomavirus genome is a double-stranded circular DNA molecule ~8,000 base pairs in length. It is packaged within the L1 shell along with cellular histone proteins, which serve to wrap and condense DNA.

The papillomavirus capsid also contains a viral protein known as L2, which is less abundant. Although not clear how L2 is arranged within the virion, it is known to perform several important functions, including facilitating the packaging of the viral genome into nascent virions as well as the infectious entry of the virus into new host cells. L2 is of interest as a possible target for more broadly protective HPV vaccines.

The viral capsid consists of 72 capsomeres of which 12 are five-coordinated and 60 are six-coordinated capsomeres, arranged on a T = 7d icosahedral surface lattice.

==Tissue specificity==
Papillomaviruses replicate exclusively in keratinocytes. Keratinocytes form the outermost layers of the skin, as well as some mucosal surfaces, such as the inside of the cheek or the walls of the vagina. These surface tissues, which are known as stratified squamous epithelia, are composed of stacked layers of flattened cells. The cell layers are formed through a process known as cellular differentiation, in which keratinocytes gradually become specialized, eventually forming a hard, crosslinked surface that prevents moisture loss and acts as a barrier against pathogens. Less-differentiated keratinocyte stem cells, replenished on the surface layer, are thought to be the initial target of productive papillomavirus infections. Subsequent steps in the viral life cycle are strictly dependent on the process of keratinocyte differentiation. As a result, papillomaviruses can only replicate in body surface tissues.

==Life cycle==
===Infectious entry===
Papillomaviruses gain access to keratinocyte stem cells through small wounds, known as microtraumas, in the skin or mucosal surface. Interactions between L1 and sulfated sugars on the cell surface promote initial attachment of the virus. The virus is then able to get inside from the cell surface via interaction with a specific receptor, likely via the alpha-6 beta-4 integrin, and transported to membrane-enclosed vesicles called endosomes. The capsid protein L2 disrupts the membrane of the endosome through a cationic cell-penetrating peptide, allowing the viral genome to escape and traffic, along with L2, to the cell nucleus.

===Viral persistence and latency===
After successful infection of a keratinocyte, the virus expresses E1 and E2 proteins, which are for replicating and maintaining the viral DNA as a circular episome. The viral oncogenes E6 and E7 promote cell growth by inactivating the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb. Keratinocyte stem cells in the epithelial basement layer can maintain papillomavirus genomes for decades.

===Production of progeny virus===
The current understanding is that viral DNA replication likely occurs in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and rely on recombination-dependent replication supported by DNA damage response mechanisms (activated by the E7 protein) to produce progeny viral genomes. Papillomavirus genomes are sometimes integrated into the host genome, especially noticeable with oncogenic HPVs, but is not a normal part of the virus life cycle and a dead-end that eliminates the potential of viral progeny production.

The expression of the viral late genes, L1 and L2, is exclusively restricted to differentiating keratinocytes in the outermost layers of the skin or mucosal surface. The increased expression of L1 and L2 is typically correlated with a dramatic increase in the number of copies of the viral genome. Since the outer layers of stratified squamous epithelia are subject to relatively limited surveillance by cells of the immune system, it is thought that this restriction of viral late gene expression represents a form of immune evasion.

New infectious progeny viruses are assembled in the cell nucleus. Papillomaviruses have evolved a mechanism for releasing virions into the environment. Other kinds of non-enveloped animal viruses utilize an active lytic process to kill the host cell, allowing release of progeny virus particles. Often this lytic process is associated with inflammation, which might trigger immune attack against the virus. Papillomaviruses exploit desquamation as a stealthy, non-inflammatory release mechanism.
==Association with cancer==
Although some papillomavirus types can cause cancer in the epithelial tissues they inhabit, cancer is not a typical outcome of infection. The development of papillomavirus-induced cancers typically occurs over the course of many years. Papillomaviruses have been associated with the development of cervical cancer, penile cancer and oral cancers. An association with vulval cancer and urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation in patients with neurogenic bladder has also been noted. There are cancer causing papillomavirus genome that encodes two small proteins called E6 and E7 that mimic cancer causing oncogenes. The way they work is that they stimulate unnatural growth of cells and block their natural defenses. Also they act on many signaling proteins that control proliferation and apoptosis.

==Laboratory study==
The fact that the papillomavirus life cycle strictly requires keratinocyte differentiation has posed a substantial barrier to the study of papillomaviruses in the laboratory, since it has precluded the use of conventional cell lines to grow the viruses. Because infectious BPV-1 virions can be extracted from the large warts the virus induces on cattle, it has been a workhorse model papillomavirus type for many years. CRPV, rabbit oral papillomavirus (ROPV) and canine oral papillomavirus (COPV) have also been used extensively for laboratory studies. As soon as researchers discovered that these viruses cause cancer, they worked together to find a vaccine to it. Currently, the most effective way to go about it is to mimic a virus that is composed of L1 protein but lack the DNA. Basically, our immune system builds defenses against infections, but if these infections do not cause disease they can be used as a vaccine. PDB entry 6bt3 shows how antibodies surfaces attack the surface of the virus to disable it.

Some sexually transmitted HPV types have been propagated using a mouse &quot;xenograft&quot; system, in which HPV-infected human cells are implanted into immunodeficient mice. More recently, some groups have succeeded in isolating infectious HPV-16 from human cervical lesions. However, isolation of infectious virions using this technique is arduous and the yield of infectious virus is very low.

The differentiation of keratinocytes can be mimicked &quot;in vitro&quot; by exposing cultured keratinocytes to an air/liquid interface. The adaptation of such &quot;raft culture&quot; systems to the study of papillomaviruses was a significant breakthrough for &quot;in vitro&quot; study of the viral life cycle. However, raft culture systems are relatively cumbersome and the yield of infectious HPVs can be low.

The development of a yeast-based system that allows stable episomal HPV replication provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means to study several aspects of the HPV lifecycle (Angeletti 2002). For example, E2-dependent transcription, genome amplification and efficient encapsidation of full-length HPV DNAs can be easily recreated in yeast (Angeletti 2005).

Recently, transient high-yield methods for producing HPV pseudoviruses carrying reporter genes has been developed. Although pseudoviruses are not suitable for studying certain aspects of the viral life cycle, initial studies suggest that their structure and initial infectious entry into cells is probably similar in many ways to authentic papillomaviruses.

Human papillomavirus binds to heparin molecules on the surface of the cells that it infects. Studies have shown that the crystal of isolated L1 capsomeres has the heparin chains recognized by lysines lines grooves on the surface of the virus. Also those with the antibodies show that they can block this recognition.

==Genetic organization and gene expression==

The papillomavirus genome is divided into an early region (E), encoding six open reading frames (ORF) (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) that are expressed immediately after initial infection of a host cell, and a late region (L) encoding a major capsid protein L1 and a minor capsid protein L2. All viral ORFs are encoded on one DNA strand (see figure). This represents a dramatic difference between papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses, since the latter virus type expresses its early and late genes by bi-directional transcription of both DNA strands. This difference was a major factor in establishment of the consensus that papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses probably never shared a common ancestor, despite the striking similarities in the structures of their virions.

After the host cell is infected, HPV16 early promoter is activated and a polycistronic primary RNA containing all six early ORFs is transcribed. This polycistronic RNA contains three exons and two introns and undergoes active RNA splicing to generate multiple isoforms of mRNAs. One of the spliced isoform RNAs, E6*I, serves as an E7 mRNA to translate E7 oncoprotein. In contrast, an intron in the E6 ORF that remains intact without splicing is necessary for translation of E6 oncoprotein. However, viral early transcription subjects to viral E2 regulation and high E2 levels repress the transcription. HPV genomes integrate into host genome by disruption of E2 ORF, preventing E2 repression on E6 and E7. Thus, viral genome integration into host DNA genome increases E6 and E7 expression to promote cellular proliferation and the chance of malignancy.

A major viral late promoter in viral early region becomes active only in differentiated cells and its activity can be highly enhanced by viral DNA replication. The late transcript is also a polycistronic RNA which contains two introns and three exons. Alternative RNA Splicing of this late transcript is essential for L1 and L2 expression and can be regulated by RNA cis-elements and host splicing factors.

==Technical discussion of papillomavirus gene functions==
Genes within the papillomavirus genome are usually identified after similarity with other previously identified genes. However, some spurious open reading frames might have been mistaken as genes simply after their position in the genome, and might not be true genes. This applies specially to certain E3, E4, E5 and E8 open reading frames.

===E1===
Encodes a protein that binds to the viral origin of replication in the long control region of the viral genome. E1 uses ATP to exert a helicase activity that forces apart the DNA strands, thus preparing the viral genome for replication by cellular DNA replication factors.

===E2===
The E2 protein serves as a master transcriptional regulator for viral promoters located primarily in the long control region. The protein has a transactivation domain linked by a relatively unstructured hinge region to a well-characterized DNA binding domain. E2 facilitates the binding of E1 to the viral origin of replication. E2 also utilizes a cellular protein known as Bromodomain-4 (Brd4) to tether the viral genome to cellular chromosomes. This tethering to the cell&#x27;s nuclear matrix ensures faithful distribution of viral genomes to each daughter cell after cell division. It is thought that E2 serves as a negative regulator of expression for the oncogenes E6 and E7 in latently HPV-infected basal layer keratinocytes. Genetic changes, such as integration of the viral DNA into a host cell chromosome, that inactivate E2 expression tend to increase the expression of the E6 and E7 oncogenes, resulting in cellular transformation and possibly further genetic destabilization.

===E3===
This small putative gene exists only in a few papillomavirus types. The gene is not known to be expressed as a protein and does not appear to serve any function.

===E4===
Although E4 proteins are expressed at low levels during the early phase of viral infection, expression of E4 increases dramatically during the late phase of infection. In other words, its &quot;E&quot; appellation may be something of a misnomer. In the case of HPV-1, E4 can account for up to 30% of the total protein at the surface of a wart. The E4 protein of many papillomavirus types is thought to facilitate virion release into the environment by disrupting intermediate filaments of the keratinocyte cytoskeleton. Viral mutants incapable of expressing E4 do not support high-level replication of the viral DNA, but it is not yet clear how E4 facilitates DNA replication. E4 has also been shown to participate in arresting cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle.

===E5===
The E5 are small, very hydrophobic proteins that destabilise the function of many membrane proteins in the infected cell. The E5 protein of some animal papillomavirus types (mainly bovine papillomavirus type 1) functions as an oncogene primarily by activating the cell growth-promoting signaling of platelet-derived growth factor receptors. The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses associated to cancer, however, seem to activate the signal cascade initiated by epidermal growth factor upon ligand binding. HPV16 E5 and HPV2 E5 have also been shown to down-regulate the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, which may prevent the infected cell from being eliminated by killer T cells.

===E6===
E6 is a 151 amino-acid peptide that incorporates a type 1 motif with a consensus sequence –(T/S)-(X)-(V/I)-COOH. It also has two zinc finger motifs.

E6 is of particular interest because it appears to have multiple roles in the cell and to interact with many other proteins. Its major role, however, is to mediate the degradation of p53, a major tumor suppressor protein, reducing the cell&#x27;s ability to respond to DNA damage.

E6 has also been shown to target other cellular proteins, thereby altering several metabolic pathways. One such target is NFX1-91, which normally represses production of telomerase, a protein that allows cells to divide an unlimited number of times. When NFX1-91 is degraded by E6, telomerase levels increase, inactivating a major mechanism keeping cell growth in check. Additionally, E6 can act as a transcriptional cofactor—specifically, a transcription activator—when interacting with the cellular transcription factor, E2F1/DP1.

E6 can also bind to PDZ-domains, short sequences which are often found in signaling proteins. E6&#x27;s structural motif allows for interaction with PDZ domains on DLG (discs large) and hDLG (Drosophila large) tumor suppressor genes. Binding at these locations causes transformation of the DLG protein and disruption of its suppressor function. E6 proteins also interact with the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase family) proteins. These proteins, including MAGI-1, MAGI-2, and MAGI-3 are usually structural proteins, and can help with signaling. More significantly, they are believed to be involved with DLG&#x27;s suppression activity. When E6 complexes with the PDZ domains on the MAGI proteins, it distorts their shape and thereby impedes their function. Overall, the E6 protein serves to impede normal protein activity in such a way as to allow a cell to grow and multiply at the increased rate characteristic of cancer.

Since the expression of E6 is strictly required for maintenance of a malignant phenotype in HPV-induced cancers, it is an appealing target of therapeutic HPV vaccines designed to eradicate established cervical cancer tumors.

===E7===
In most papillomavirus types, the primary function of the E7 protein is to inactivate members of the pRb family of tumor suppressor proteins. Together with E6, E7 serves to prevent cell death (apoptosis) and promote cell cycle progression, thus priming the cell for replication of the viral DNA. E7 also participates in immortalization of infected cells by activating cellular telomerase. Like E6, E7 is the subject of intense research interest and is believed to exert a wide variety of other effects on infected cells. As with E6, the ongoing expression of E7 is required for survival of cancer cell lines, such as HeLa, that are derived from HPV-induced tumors.

===E8===
Only a few papillomavirus types encode a short protein from the E8 gene. In the case of BPV-4 (papillomavirus genus &quot;Xi&quot;), the E8 open reading frame may substitute for the E6 open reading frame, which is absent in this papillomavirus genus. These E8 genes are chemically and functionally similar to the E5 genes from some human papillomaviruses, and are also called E5/E8.

===L1===
L1 spontaneously self-assembles into pentameric capsomers. Purified capsomers can go on to form capsids, which are stabilized by disulfide bonds between neighboring L1 molecules. L1 capsids assembled &quot;in vitro&quot; are the basis of prophylactic vaccines against several HPV types. Compared to other papillomavirus genes, the amino acid sequences of most portions of L1 are well-conserved between types. However, the surface loops of L1 can differ substantially, even for different members of a particular papillomavirus species. This probably reflects a mechanism for evasion of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by previous papillomavirus infections.

===L2===
L2 exists in an oxidized state within the papillomavirus virion, with the two conserved cysteine residues forming an intramolecular disulfide bond. In addition to cooperating with L1 to package the viral DNA into the virion, L2 has been shown to interact with a number of cellular proteins during the infectious entry process. After the initial binding of the virion to the cell, L2 must be cleaved by the cellular protease furin. The virion is internalized, probably through a clathrin-mediated process, into an endosome, where acidic conditions are thought to lead to exposure of membrane-destabilizing portions of L2. The cellular proteins beta-actin and syntaxin-18 may also participate in L2-mediated entry events. After endosome escape, L2 and the viral genome are imported into the cell nucleus where they traffic to a sub-nuclear domain known as an ND-10 body that is rich in transcription factors. Small portions of L2 are well-conserved between different papillomavirus types, and experimental vaccines targeting these conserved domains may offer protection against a broad range of HPV types.

<text>The Communist Labor Party of America (CLPA) was one of the organizational predecessors of the Communist Party USA.

The group was established at the end of August 1919 following a three-way split of the Socialist Party of America. Although a legal political party at the time of its formation, with a form of organization closely resembling that of the Socialist Party whence it sprung, the group was quickly forced underground by the Palmer Raids of January 1920 and thereafter conducted its activities in secret.

The group merged with a dissident faction of the Communist Party of America in May 1921 to form the United Communist Party of America.

== Organizational history ==
=== Background ===

With the end of World War I and the consolidation of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1918, long running tension in the Socialist Party of America (SPA) between the revolutionary socialist left-wing and the electorally-oriented center deepened. Radicals were particularly disheartened by the tepid 1916 campaign of &quot;colorless&quot; Socialist presidential candidate Allan L. Benson—an effort which saw the first reduction in the party&#x27;s tally in presidential voting in party history.

From roots in the Boston-based Socialist Propaganda League of America and the Boston newspaper &quot;The Revolutionary Age,&quot; an organized faction calling itself the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party emerged at the end of 1918. Radical editor Louis C. Fraina composed a Left Wing Manifesto, around which the Left Wing Section organized itself, holding raucous meetings of SPA locals and branches to force endorsement of the program and running a slate of candidates in the SPA&#x27;s annual election in an attempt to &quot;capture&quot; and remold the party according to the Russian Bolshevik Party&#x27;s model.

Buoyed by the bloc voting of radical, Bolshevik-influenced branches of the Socialist Party&#x27;s Foreign Language Federations, the Left Wing Section very apparently won a majority of the 15 seats on the party&#x27;s governing National Executive Committee as well as balloting for International delegates and International Secretary in the 1919 election. Facing ceding party control to an aggressive Bolshevik National Executive Committee, the outgoing National executive Committee, guided by James Oneal and Executive Secretary Adolph Germer, declared that voting irregularities had rendered the result invalid.

Suspensions and expulsions of a major part of the SPA&#x27;s membership immediately followed, beginning with the May 1919 suspensions of the Russian, Lithuanian, Polish, Latvian, South Slavic and Ukrainian Federations in addition to the entire state socialist parties of Michigan, Massachusetts and Ohio. In New York, the State Executive Committee suspended and &quot;reorganized&quot; Left Wing locals and branches representing nearly half the state&#x27;s membership. By July 1919, the Socialist Party had purged itself through suspensions and expulsions of more than 60,000 of the nearly 110,000 members that it had touted in January of that year.

With Oneal and Germer&#x27;s Party Regulars clearly in control of the situation, the suspended Foreign Language Federations and idiosyncratic Socialist Party of Michigan determined to move immediately to the formation of a Communist Party of America and issued a call for a founding convention to be held in Chicago on September 1, 1919. Others determined to fight on against the odds to restore the results of the 1919 party election at the scheduled August 30 convention of the Socialist Party. It was this latter group that would go on to establish the Communist Labor Party of America.

=== Establishment ===

Most of the English-speaking Left Wingers, headed by National Executive Committee members Alfred Wagenknecht and L. E. Katterfeld and including prominent New York journalist John Reed determined to fight on in an attempt to win control of the Socialist Party for the Left Wing. However, with many Left Wingers already abandoning this approach and the Regular faction firmly in control of a majority of the states electing delegates to the Emergency National Convention in Chicago scheduled for August 30, 1919, the fight was essentially over before it began.

The Credentials Committee of this convention was easily won by adherents of the Oneal-Germer Regulars, who froze out Left Wing-oriented delegations from California, Oregon and Minnesota. Roughly two dozen delegates pledging allegiance to the Left Wing Section bolted the convention to meet downstairs in a previously rented room, along with about 50 other Left Wingers from around the country. These latter delegates constituted themselves as the Communist Labor Party of America on August 31, 1919.

Executive Secretary of the Communist Labor Party of America was Alfred Wagenknecht of Ohio. The five-member National Executive Committee consisted of Max Bedacht, Alexander Bilan, L. E. Katterfeld, Jack Carney and Edward Lindgren. Initial headquarters were maintained in Cleveland before being moved to New York City in December 1919.

=== Underground period ===
The party moved to the underground in response to mass arrests and deportations conducted by the Justice Department and its Bureau of Investigation, guided by Special Assistant to the Attorney General J. Edgar Hoover. These raids and the move to the underground virtually destroyed the organization, which only existed in skeletal form in the first half of 1920, although publication of its legal newspaper, &quot;The Toiler,&quot; was maintained. The party also published an &quot;illegal&quot; underground monthly paper called &quot;Communist Labor Party News&quot; and issued the final issue of Ludwig Lore&#x27;s theoretical magazine &quot;The Class Struggle&quot; under its auspices.

=== Dissolution through merger ===
On April 18, 1920, Executive Secretary C. E. Ruthenberg exited the Communist Party of America and along with his factional supporters (such as Jay Lovestone and Isaac Edward Ferguson) constituted themselves as the &quot;real&quot; Communist Party of America with a view to merger with the Communist Labor Party of America. This organizational marriage took place at a secret Joint Unity Convention held at Bridgman, Michigan in August 1922. The resulting organization, also organized along underground lines to avoid arrest, was known as the United Communist Party of America (UCPA).

The Communist International to which the UCPA and the CPA both pledged their allegiance sought to end duplication, competition and hostility between the two communist parties and insisted on a merger into a single organization. That was eventually brought about in May 1921 at a secret gathering held at the Overlook Mountain House hotel, near Woodstock, New York. The resulting unified group was also known as the Communist Party of America, which morphed into the Workers Party of America (December 1921) and changed its name in 1925 to Workers (Communist) Party and to Communist Party USA in 1929.

== Party press ==
During the party&#x27;s brief life, five English-language periodicals were affiliated with it, with some inherited from organizations that had merged into the party and some new:
* &quot;The Toiler&quot; (Cleveland) – This paper was formerly the official publication of the Socialist Party of Ohio under the name &quot;The Ohio Socialist.&quot; The paper changed its name to &quot;The Toiler&quot; upon its establishment as the official party paper. Due to police pressure, the official publisher was changed to the Toiler Publishing Association late in 1919, thereby allowing the paper to continue as a &quot;legal&quot; publication under the pretext of independence.
* &quot;Voice of Labor&quot; (Chicago) – This was the serial began by John Reed and Ben Gitlow after they became disaffected with the majority of the National Left Wing Council. It continued as the labor organ of the CPA until it merged into the UCPA. It remained as a UCPA paper until it folded in July. It ran from Vol. I #1 August 15, 1919 to Vol. II #2 July 10, 1920.
* &quot;Communist Labor News&quot; (Cleveland) – One or two issues of a four-page broadsheet bearing this name were produced immediately after the party&#x27;s formation, with content substantially similar to material also printed in the &quot;Ohio Socialist.&quot;
* &quot;Communist Labor&quot; (New York) – Six issues of this irregularly-issued tabloid newspaper were produced between December 6, 1919, and May 15, 1920 This was the &quot;illegal&quot; underground organ of the CLPA.
* &quot;The Class Struggle&quot; (New York) – The final issue of this theoretical journal, dated November 1919, bore the imprint of the CLPA on the cover. It was terminated for financial reasons.

<text>Daniel Davis (born November 26, 1945) is an American film, stage and television actor. He portrayed Niles the butler on the sitcom &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1993 to 1999) and had two guest appearances as Professor Moriarty on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (a role he reprised on &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;), affecting an upper class English accent for both roles. He voices the intelligent Cro-Magnon, Longhair, from the Longhair and Doubledome cartoon shorts from Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Big Pick&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Davis was born on November 26, 1945, in Gurdon, Arkansas, and grew up in Little Rock. His parents operated a cinema. His first acting job was at the age of 11, when he was cast in a local broadcast program, &quot;Betty&#x27;s Little Rascals&quot;.

Davis graduated from Hall High School in Little Rock in 1964. He graduated from the Arkansas Arts Center with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, followed by work with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, and six years with the American Conservatory Theater (ACT). During his time at ACT, he taught acting classes.

==Career==

===Television and film===
Davis first became popular in daytime television playing opposite Beverlee McKinsey as her character Iris Cory&#x27;s former (and presumed dead) husband, Elliot Carrington, on the soap opera &quot;Texas&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Another World&quot;, from October 1980 to December 1981. In 1985, he played a renegade soldier in the Season 4 episode, &quot;The Doctor is Out&quot;, of the television series &quot;The A-Team&quot;.

Davis played his most famous character, Niles the Butler, on the television series &quot;The Nanny&quot; throughout its run from 1993 to 1999 and in its reunion special in 2004 (in cameo flashbacks only). Niles was known for his frequent use of deadpan one-liners, usually insulting character C. C. Babcock, with whom Niles eventually fell in love and married in the series&#x27; last season.

His natural accent is Southern American; however, his English accent as Niles was so accurate that many viewers thought he was actually English. He also used an English accent as Professor Moriarty in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episodes &quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot; and &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot;. However, as the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the 1990 film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, Davis spoke with his own American accent. Davis&#x27; cartoon voice for the charter Longhair, from the &quot;Longhair and Doubledome&quot; cartoon shorts from Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Big Pick&quot; in 2000, was also English.

In 2002, Davis guest-starred on the television series &quot;Frasier&quot;, playing Dr. Shafer in Season 10, Episode 8, &quot;Rooms with a View&quot;.

Davis was among the group of celebrities lip-synching to the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; on the &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; episode of &quot;American Idol&quot; on April 25, 2007. He appeared briefly in the 2006 film &quot;The Prestige&quot;, directed by Christopher Nolan.

In 2008 he guest-starred on the television series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;.

In December 2010, he appeared on &quot;The Fran Drescher Show&quot; through Skype. In 2012, he recorded the audiobook of the Star Wars novel &quot;Star Wars: Darth Plagueis&quot;, by James Luceno.

Davis reprised the role of Professor Moriarty in the third and final season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;.

=== Theatre ===
Davis is an established theatre actor. He has appeared in both Broadway and off-Broadway productions in New York, and has appeared at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

His first Broadway role was as Antonio Salieri in &quot;Amadeus&quot; in 1980.

Off-Broadway, he played Rubin in &quot;Lake No Bottom&quot; in 1990, the Duke of Buckingham in &quot;The Tragedy of Richard III&quot;, and he starred as Gaev in &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; in 2011.

In 2000, Davis was nominated for a Best Featured Actor Tony Award for his role in David Hirson&#x27;s Broadway play &quot;Wrong Mountain&quot;. He played Oscar Wilde in &quot;The Invention of Love&quot; in 2001. In 2003, he appeared in the Alan Bennett play &quot;Talking Heads&quot;. In 2004, he portrayed George Bernard Shaw in the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;The Frogs&quot;. He co-starred in &quot;La Cage Aux Folles&quot; with Gary Beach from November 2004 to March 2005. (Reportedly, he clashed frequently with Beach and others. He was eventually replaced by Robert Goulet.)

In 2007, Davis was a member of the cast of an audio production of the play &quot;Blue/Orange&quot;, in which he took the part of Dr. Robert Smith.

In July 2008, he portrayed King Lear at the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, under the direction of Bonnie J. Monte.

In November 2010, Davis was part of the Celebrity Autobiography series at the Long Center for the Performing Arts in Austin, Texas. He performed along with fellow &quot;Nanny&quot; alum Lauren Lane and &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; alum Michael Urie.

In 2012, he played Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; at Hartford Stage.

In 2015, Davis starred in a one-off performance in A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;Love Letters&quot; opposite Lauren Lane with proceeds going to the Texas State BFA Acting Program. 

In 2016, he appeared on Broadway as Selsdon Mowbray in the Roundabout Theatre revival of &quot;Noises Off&quot; at the American Airlines Theatre.

<text>Edmund Zygfryd Trebus (11 November 1918 – 29 September 2002) was a compulsive hoarder who came to fame when he was featured on the British television documentary series &quot;A Life of Grime&quot;.

==Biography==
Edmund Trebus was born in Ostrowo, near Danzig (Gdańsk), in what was then the newly established Weimar Republic (now Poland), on 11 November 1918, the day of the Armistice.

When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939 Trebus was conscripted into the Wehrmacht. He was then captured and served with the Allied forces in Italy, in an anti-tank unit of the II Corps of the Polish armed forces, which was under British command.

After moving to England just after the Second World War, Trebus married Jozefa Noga in 1949. They had five children.

Trebus had been a collector all his life and he was often seen pushing a handcart filled with his latest acquisitions, which he carefully sorted into separate piles in his garden and home. One of Trebus&#x27;s major loves was Elvis Presley, and he managed to collect and store away a copy of almost every single Elvis record.

In his eighties, living alone in a run-down house in Crouch End in North London, Trebus was constantly in trouble with the environmental health department of the London Borough of Haringey because of complaints about the rubbish surrounding his home. He lived in a tiny area on the ground floor of his house, surrounded by piles of rubbish, because he never threw anything away. In the BBC documentary series &quot;A Life of Grime&quot;, Trebus was repeatedly shown arguing with council workers who had been instructed to clear his house of the of rubbish it contained. He was eventually rehoused at the Trentfield Nursing Home in Southgate, where he died at the age of 83. Following his death, the BBC broadcast an hour-long tribute, &quot;Mr Trebus: A Life of Grime&quot;.

<doc id="606009" wikidata="Q1364270" url="?curid=606009" title="Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy">
<text>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, or HOCM when obstructive) is a condition in which muscle tissues of the heart become thickened without an obvious cause. The parts of the heart most commonly affected are the interventricular septum and the ventricles. This results in the heart being less able to pump blood effectively and also may cause electrical conduction problems. Specifically, within the bundle branches that conduct impulses through the interventricular septum and into the Purkinje fibers, as these are responsible for the depolarization of contractile cells of both ventricles.

People who have HCM may have a range of symptoms. People may be asymptomatic, or may have fatigue, leg swelling, and shortness of breath. It may also result in chest pain or fainting. Symptoms may be worse when the person is dehydrated. Complications may include heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, and sudden cardiac death.
HCM is most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is often due to mutations in certain genes involved with making heart muscle proteins. Other inherited causes of left ventricular hypertrophy may include Fabry disease, Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia, and certain medications such as tacrolimus. Other considerations for causes of enlarged heart are athlete&#x27;s heart and hypertension (high blood pressure). Making the diagnosis of HCM often involves a family history or pedigree, an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and stress testing. Genetic testing may also be done. HCM can be distinguished from other inherited causes of cardiomyopathy by its autosomal dominant pattern, whereas Fabry disease is X-linked, and Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
Treatment may depend on symptoms and other risk factors. Medications may include the use of beta blockers, verapamil or disopyramide. An implantable cardiac defibrillator may be recommended in those with certain types of irregular heartbeat. Surgery, in the form of a septal myectomy or heart transplant, may be done in those who do not improve with other measures. With treatment, the risk of death from the disease is less than one percent per year.
HCM affects up to one in 500 people. People of all ages may be affected. The first modern description of the disease was by Donald Teare in 1958.

With a common occurrence amongst athletes, there have been many cases among professional athletes. Danny Jones (rugby league) passed away during a rugby league game for Keighley Cougars against London Skolars in 2015 at the age of 29. Footballer Fabrice Muamba survived a nearly fatal cardiac arrest during a game for Tottenham Hotspur in 2012. Muamba was saved by life-saving treatment from medical staff at the game and a consultant cardiologist who was attending the game as a fan and entered the pitch once he saw what happening to Muamba. 

== Signs and symptoms ==

Many people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and many of those carrying disease genes for HCM do not have clinically detectable disease. The symptoms of HCM include shortness of breath due to stiffening and decreased blood filling of the ventricles, exertional chest pain (sometimes known as angina) due to reduced blood flow to the coronary arteries, uncomfortable awareness of the heart beat (palpitations), as well as disruption of the electrical system running through the abnormal heart muscle, lightheadedness, weakness, fainting and sudden cardiac death.

Shortness of breath is largely due to increased thickness of the left ventricle (LV), which impairs the filling of the ventricles, but also leads to elevated pressure in the left ventricle and left atrium as a result of increased thickness involving the interventricular septum obstructing the left ventricular outflow, causing back pressure and interstitial congestion in the lungs. Symptoms are not closely related to the presence or severity of an outflow tract gradient. Often, symptoms mimic those of congestive heart failure (esp. activity intolerance and dyspnea), but treatment of each is different. Beta-blockers are used in both cases, but treatment with diuretics, a mainstay of CHF treatment, will exacerbate symptoms in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy by decreasing ventricular preload volume and thereby increasing outflow resistance (less blood to push aside the thickened obstructing tissue).

Major risk factors for sudden death in individuals with HCM include prior history of cardiac arrest or ventricular fibrillation, spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia, abnormal exercise blood pressure and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, unexplained syncope, family history of premature sudden death, and LVW thickness greater than 15 mm to 30 mm, on echocardiogram.

HCM also presents with a systolic ejection murmur that increases in intensity with decreased preload (as in the Valsalva maneuver or standing), or with decreased afterload (as in vasodilator administration). On the other hand, the murmur decreases in intensity with increased preload (as in squatting) or increased afterload (as in the handgrip maneuver). &quot;Spike and dome&quot; pulse and &quot;triple ripple apical impulse&quot; are two other signs that can be discovered in physical examination.

Pulsus bisferiens may occasionally be found during examination.

==Genetics==

Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait which is attributed to mutations in one of several genes that encode for the sarcomere proteins, and most diagnosed individuals will have an affected parent. Occasionally, both copies of the gene will be defective, a condition that may lead to a more severe manifestation of the disease.

Currently, about 50–60% of people with a high index of clinical suspicion for HCM will have a mutation identified in at least one of nine sarcomeric genes. Approximately 40% of these mutations occur in the β-myosin heavy chain gene on chromosome 14 q11.2-3, and approximately 40% involve the cardiac myosin-binding protein C gene. Since HCM is typically an autosomal dominant trait, children of a single HCM parent have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease-causing mutation. Whenever such a mutation is identified, family-specific genetic testing can be used to identify relatives at risk for the disease, although clinical severity and age of onset cannot be predicted.An insertion/deletion polymorphism in the gene encoding for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) alters the clinical phenotype of the disease. The D/D (deletion/deletion) genotype of ACE is associated with more marked hypertrophy of the left ventricle and may be associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes.

Over 1400 mutations have been identified in genes known to lead to HCM. Some mutations could have more harmful potential compared to others (β-myosin heavy chain). For example, troponin T mutations were originally associated with a 50% mortality before the age of 40. However, a more recent and larger study found a similar risk to other sarcomeric protein mutations. The age at disease onset of HCM with MYH7 is earlier and leads to more severe symptoms. Moreover, mutations on troponin C can alter Ca+2 sensibility on force development in cardiac muscle, these mutations are named after the amino acid that was changed after the location in which it happened, such as A8V, A31S, C84Y and D145E.

== Pathophysiology ==
Ventricular hypertrophy causes a dynamic pressure gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), which is associated with further narrowing of the outflow during systole. Pulling of the mitral valve leaflets towards the septum contributes to the outflow obstruction. This pulling is thought to occur by several proposed mechanisms, including that the flow of blood through the narrowed outflow tract results in it having a higher velocity, and less pressure through the Venturi effect. This low pressure then causes the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve to be pulled into the outflow tract, resulting in further obstruction.

== Diagnosis ==
A diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is based upon several features of the disease process. While there is use of echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, or cardiac MRI in the diagnosis of the disease, other important considerations include ECG, genetic testing (although not primarily used for diagnosis), and any family history of HCM or unexplained sudden death in otherwise healthy individuals.
In about 60 to 70% of the cases, cardiac MRI shows thickening of more than 15 mm of the lower part of the ventricular septum. T1-weighted imaging may identify scarring of cardiac tissues while T2-weighted imaging may identify edema and inflammation of cardiac tissue which is associated with acute clinical signs of chest pain and fainting episodes.

ECG is the most sensitive diagnostic test. The combination of left ventricular hypertrophy, and right atrial enlargement on ECG strongly suggests HCM.

===Variants ===
Depending on whether the distortion of normal heart anatomy causes an obstruction of the outflow of blood from the left ventricle of the heart, HCM can be classified as obstructive or non-obstructive. The obstructive variant of HCM is hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), also historically known as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (IHSS) or asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH). The diagnosis of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is usually made by echocardiographic assessment and is defined as a peak left ventricular outflow tract gradient of ≥ 30 mmHg.

Another, non-obstructive variant of HCM is apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM or ApHCM), also called Yamaguchi syndrome. It was first described in individuals of Japanese descent. Sakamoto was the first to report the condition&#x27;s ECG pattern in 1976. Yamaguchi was the first to characterize the syndrome and its ventriculargrophic feature in 1979. Yamaguchi syndrome is an infrequent variant of HCM in the European population. ApHCM is thought to be autosomal dominant, with the majority of mutations occurring in the genes encoding for the sarcomere. In the thick myofilaments of the heart tissue, the predominant gene mutations occur in “myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC3)” and “myosin heavy chain (MYH7).” Myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, embolic events, and/or congestive heart failure are all possible outcomes of this condition. On auscultation, the presence of fourth heart sound(S4), deep negative T waves on ECG notably in the precordial leads, and a &quot;spade-like&quot; structure of the left ventricular chamber at end-diastole on the left ventriculography and also in 2D echo are all common signs of apical HCM. Sometimes, its ECG and clinical presentation may be misdiagnosed as acute coronary syndrome. The apical HCM has a lower mortality rate and better prognosis than other variant types of HCM.

===Cardiac catheterization===
Upon cardiac catheterization, catheters can be placed in the left ventricle and the ascending aorta, to measure the pressure difference between these structures. In normal individuals, during ventricular systole, the pressure in the ascending aorta and the left ventricle will equalize, and the aortic valve is open. In individuals with aortic stenosis or with HCM with an outflow tract gradient, there will be a pressure gradient (difference) between the left ventricle and the aorta, with the left ventricular pressure higher than the aortic pressure. This gradient represents the degree of obstruction that has to be overcome to eject blood from the left ventricle.

The Brockenbrough–Braunwald–Morrow sign is observed in individuals with HCM with an outflow tract gradient. This sign can be used to differentiate HCM from aortic stenosis. In individuals with aortic stenosis, after a premature ventricular contraction (PVC), the following ventricular contraction will be more forceful, and the pressure generated in the left ventricle will be higher. Because of the fixed obstruction that the stenotic aortic valve represents, the post-PVC ascending aortic pressure will increase as well. In individuals with HCM, however, the degree of obstruction will increase more than the force of contraction will increase in the post-PVC beat. The result of this is that the left ventricular pressure increases and the ascending aortic pressure &quot;decreases&quot;, with an increase in the LVOT gradient.

While the Brockenbrough–Braunwald–Morrow sign is most dramatically demonstrated using simultaneous intra-cardiac and intra-aortic catheters, it can be seen on routine physical examination as a decrease in the pulse pressure in the post-PVC beat in individuals with HCM.

== Screening ==
Although HCM may be asymptomatic, affected individuals may present with symptoms ranging from mild to critical heart failure and sudden cardiac death at any point from early childhood to seniority. HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes in the United States, and the most common genetic cardiovascular disorder. One study found that the incidence of sudden cardiac death in young competitive athletes declined in the Veneto region of Italy by 89% since the 1982 introduction of routine cardiac screening for athletes, from an unusually high starting rate. As of 2010, however, studies have shown that the incidence of sudden cardiac death, among all people with HCM, has declined to one percent or less. Screen-positive individuals who are diagnosed with cardiac disease are usually told to avoid competitive athletics.

HCM can be detected with an echocardiogram (ECHO) with 80%+ accuracy, which can be preceded by screening with an electrocardiogram (ECG) to test for heart abnormalities. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), considered the gold standard for determining the physical properties of the left ventricular wall, can serve as an alternative screening tool when an echocardiogram provides inconclusive results. For example, the identification of segmental lateral ventricular hypertrophy cannot be accomplished with echocardiography alone. Also, left ventricular hypertrophy may be absent in children under thirteen years of age. This undermines the results of pre-adolescents&#x27; echocardiograms. Researchers, however, have studied asymptomatic carriers of an HCM-causing mutation through the use of CMR and have been able to identify crypts in the interventricular septal tissue in these people. It has been proposed that the formation of these crypts is an indication of myocyte disarray and altered vessel walls that may later result in the clinical expression of HCM. A possible explanation for this is that the typical gathering of family history only focuses on whether sudden death occurred or not. It fails to acknowledge the age at which relatives had had sudden cardiac death, as well as the frequency of the cardiac events. Furthermore, given the several factors necessary to be considered at risk for sudden cardiac death, while most of the factors do not have strong predictive value individually, there exists ambiguity regarding when to implement special treatment.

=== United States ===
There are several potential challenges associated with routine screening for HCM in the United States. First, the U.S. athlete population of 15 million is almost twice as large as Italy&#x27;s estimated athlete population. Second, these events are rare, with fewer than 100 deaths in the U.S. due to HCM in competitive athletes per year, or about 1 death per 220,000 athletes. Lastly, genetic testing would provide a definitive diagnosis; however, due to the numerous HCM-causing mutations, this method of screening is complex and is not cost-effective. Therefore, genetic testing in the United States is limited to individuals who exhibit clear symptoms of HCM and their family members. This ensures that the test is not wasted on detecting other causes of ventricular hypertrophy (due to its low sensitivity) and that family members of the individual are educated on the potential risk of being carriers of the mutant gene(s).

=== Canada ===
Canadian genetic testing guidelines and recommendations for individuals diagnosed with HCM are as follows:
* The main purpose of genetic testing is to screen family members.
** According to the results, at-risk relatives may be encouraged to undergo extensive testing.
* Genetic testing is not meant to confirm a diagnosis.
** If the diagnosed individual has no relatives that are at risk, then genetic testing is not required.
* Genetic testing is not intended for risk assessment or treatment decisions.
** Evidence only supports clinical testing in predicting the progression and risk of developing complications of HCM.

For individuals &quot;suspected&quot; of having HCM:
* Genetic testing is not recommended for determining other causes of left ventricular hypertrophy (such as &quot;athlete&#x27;s heart&quot;, hypertension, and cardiac amyloidosis).
** HCM may be differentiated from other hypertrophy-causing conditions using clinical history and clinical testing.

==Treatment==

===Asymptomatic people===
A significant number of people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy do not have any symptoms and will have a normal life expectancy, although they should avoid particularly strenuous activities or competitive athletics. Asymptomatic people should be screened for risk factors for sudden cardiac death. In people with resting or inducible outflow obstructions, situations that will cause dehydration or vasodilation (such as the use of vasodilatory or diuretic blood pressure medications) should be avoided. Septal reduction therapy is not recommended in asymptomatic people.

===Medications===
The primary goal of medications is to relieve symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Beta blockers are considered first-line agents, as they can slow the heart rate and decrease the likelihood of ectopic beats. For people who cannot tolerate beta blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil can be used, but are potentially harmful in people who also have low blood pressure or severe shortness of breath at rest. These medications also decrease the heart rate, though their use in people with severe outflow obstruction, elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure, and low blood pressure should be done with caution. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers should be avoided in people with evidence of obstruction. For people whose symptoms are not relieved by the above treatments, disopyramide can be considered for further symptom relief. Diuretics can be considered for people with evidence of fluid overload, though cautiously used in those with evidence of obstruction. Intravenous phenylephrine (or another pure vasoconstricting agent) can be used in the acute setting of low blood pressure in those with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who do not respond to fluid administration.

Cardiac myosin inhibitors reduce left ventricular contractility by decreasing the number of active actin–myosin cross-bridges within the myocyte sarcomere. Mavacamten was shown to reduce left ventricular outflow tract gradient (a measure of obstruction) and improve symptoms in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2022 Aficamten, which has a shorter half life compared with mavacamten, achieves steady state within 2 weeks, and appears to have a wide therapeutic window, was shown to improve peak oxygen uptake during cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II or III heart failure and decreased exercise capacity.

People who continue to have symptoms despite drug therapy can consider more invasive therapies.

===Surgical septal myectomy===

Surgical septal myectomy is an open-heart operation done to relieve symptoms in people who remain severely symptomatic despite medical therapy. It has been performed successfully since the early 1960s. Surgical septal myectomy uniformly decreases left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and improves symptoms, and in experienced centers has a surgical mortality of less than 1%, as well as 85% success rate. It involves a median sternotomy (general anesthesia, opening the chest, and cardiopulmonary bypass) and removing a portion of the interventricular septum. Surgical myectomy resection that focuses just on the subaortic septum, to increase the size of the outflow tract to reduce Venturi forces, may be inadequate to abolish systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. With this limited resection, the residual mid-septal bulge still redirects flow posteriorly; SAM persists because flow still gets behind the mitral valve. It is only when the deeper portion of the septal bulge is resected that flow is redirected anteriorly away from the mitral valve, abolishing SAM. With this in mind, a modification of the Morrow myectomy termed extended myectomy, mobilization and partial excision of the papillary muscles has become the excision of choice. In people with particularly large redundant mitral valves, anterior leaflet plication may be added to complete separation of the mitral valve and outflow. Complications of septal myectomy surgery include possible death, arrhythmias, infection, incessant bleeding, septal perforation/defect, and stroke.

===Alcohol septal ablation===

Alcohol septal ablation, introduced by Ulrich Sigwart in 1994, is a percutaneous technique that involves an injection of alcohol into one or more septal branches of the left anterior descending artery. This is a catheter technique with results similar to the surgical septal myectomy procedure but is less invasive since it does not involve general anesthesia and opening of the chest wall and pericardium (which are done in a septal myectomy). In a select population with symptoms secondary to a high outflow tract gradient, alcohol septal ablation can reduce the symptoms of HCM. In addition, older individuals and those with other medical problems, for whom surgical myectomy would pose an increased procedural risk, would likely benefit from the less-invasive septal ablation procedure.

When performed properly, an alcohol septal ablation induces a controlled heart attack, in which the portion of the interventricular septum that involves the left ventricular outflow tract is infarcted and will contract into a scar. There is debate over which people are best served by surgical myectomy, alcohol septal ablation, or medical therapy.

===Mitral clip===

Since 2013, mitral clips have been implanted via a catheter as a new strategy to correct the motion of the mitral valve in people with severe obstructive HCM. The device fastens together the mitral valve leaflets to improve the heart&#x27;s blood outflow. The mitral clip has not yet established the same long-term reliability as septal myectomy or alcohol septal ablation, but HCM specialists are increasingly offering the clip as a less-invasive treatment option.

===Implantable pacemaker or defibrillator===

The use of a pacemaker has been advocated in a subset of individuals, to cause asynchronous contraction of the left ventricle. Since the pacemaker activates the interventricular septum before the left ventricular free wall, the gradient across the left ventricular outflow tract may decrease. This form of treatment has been shown to provide less relief of symptoms and less of a reduction in the left ventricular outflow tract gradient when compared to surgical myectomy. Technological advancements have also led to the development of a dual-chamber pacemaker, which is only turned on when needed (in contrast to a regular pacemaker which provides a constant stimulus). Although the dual-chamber pacemaker has been shown to decrease ventricular outflow tract obstruction, experimental trials have found only a few individuals with improved symptoms. Researchers suspect that these reports of improved symptoms are due to a placebo effect.

The procedure includes an incision on the anterolateral area below the clavicle. Two leads are then inserted; one into the right atrium and the other into the right ventricular apex via the subclavian veins. Once in place, they are secured and attached to the generator which will remain inside the fascia, anterior to the pectoral muscle. Complications of this procedure include infection, electrical lead, and generator malfunction which will require replacement.

For people with HCM who exhibit one or more of the major risk factors for sudden cardiac death, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or a combination pacemaker/ICD all-in-one unit may be recommended as an appropriate precaution. In 2014, European Society of Cardiology suggested a practical risk score to calculate that risk.

===Cardiac transplantation===

In cases that are unresponsive to all other forms of treatment, cardiac transplantation is one option. It is also the only treatment available for end-stage heart failure. However, transplantation must occur before the onset of symptoms such as pulmonary vessel hypertension, kidney malfunction, and thromboembolism for it to be successful. Studies have indicated a seven-year survival rate of 94% in people with HCM after transplantation.

==Prognosis==
A systematic review from 2002 concluded that: &quot;Overall, HCM confers an annual mortality rate of about 1%... HCM may be associated with important symptoms and premature death but more frequently with no or relatively mild disability and normal life expectancy.&quot;

==Children==
Even though hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) may be present early in life and is most likely congenital, it is one of the most uncommon cardiac malformations encountered in pediatric cardiology, largely because the presentation of symptoms is usually absent, incomplete, or delayed into adulthood. Most of the current information pertaining to HCM arises from studies in adult populations, and the implication of these observations for the pediatric population is often uncertain. Nonetheless, recent studies in pediatric cardiology have revealed that HCM accounts for 42% of childhood cardiomyopathies, with an annual incidence rate of 0.47/100,000 in children. Further, in asymptomatic cases, sudden death is considered one of the most-feared complications associated with the disease in select pediatric populations. Consequently, the recommended practice is to screen children of affected individuals throughout childhood to detect cardiac abnormalities at an early stage, in the hope of preventing further complications of the disease.

Generally, the diagnosis of HCM in a pediatric population is made during assessment for murmur, congestive heart failure, physical exhaustion, and genetic testing of children of affected individuals. Specifically, echocardiogram (ECHO) has been used as a definitive noninvasive diagnostic tool in nearly all children. ECHO assesses cardiac ventricular size, wall thickness, systolic and diastolic function, and outflow obstruction. Thus, ECHO has been chosen as an ideal means to detect excessive wall thickening of cardiac muscle in HCM.

For children with HCM, treatment strategies aim to reduce disease symptoms and lower the risk of sudden death. Due to the heterogeneity of the disease, treatment is usually modified according to individual&#x27;s needs. β-blockers improve left ventricular filling and relaxation and thereby lessen symptoms. In some children, β–blockers (e.g., propranolol) were shown effective in reducing the risk of sudden death. Further, calcium channel blockers (verapamil) and antiarrhythmic drugs may be used as an adjunct therapy to β-blockers in symptomatic children. Nonetheless, further testing is needed to determine their definitive benefits.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of HCM in the general population globally is 0.2% (1 in 500 adults), as determined by echocardiographic studies. HCM is more common in males than females. The most common presentation of HCM is in the third decade of life, though it can present at any age, from newborns to the elderly.

==Other animals==

=== Cats ===
Feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common heart disease in domestic cats; the disease process and genetics are believed to be similar to the disease in humans. In Maine Coon cats, HCM has been confirmed as an autosomal dominant inherited trait. Numerous cat breeds have HCM as a problem in the breed. The first genetic mutation (in cardiac myosin binding protein C) responsible for feline HCM was discovered in 2005 in Maine Coon cats. A test for this mutation (A31P) is available. About one-third of Maine Coon cats tested for the mutation are either heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation, although many of the cats that are heterozygous have no overt evidence of the disease on an echocardiogram (low penetrance). Some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation, strongly suggesting that another cause exists in the breed. The cardiac myosin binding protein C mutation identified in Maine Coon cats has not been found in any other breed of cat with HCM, but more recently another myosin binding protein C mutation has been identified in Ragdoll cats with HCM. As in humans, feline HCM is not present at birth but develops over time. It has been identified for the first time in cats as young as 6 months of age and at least as old as 7 years of age.

Clinically, cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy commonly have a systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve (see graphic). Cats with severe HCM often develop left heart failure (pulmonary edema; pleural effusion) because of severe diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. They may also develop a left atrial thrombus that embolizes, most commonly, to the terminal aorta creating acute pain and rear limb paralysis (see below). Sudden death can also occur but appears to be uncommon.

Ultrasound of the heart (echocardiography) is necessary to diagnose HCM in cats. Measurement of circulating cardiac biomarkers, like N‐terminal‐proBNP (NT‐proBNP) and troponin I (TnI) may be used in cats to strengthen the suspicion of cardiac disease. There is a Point-of-care test for feline NT-proBNP available which can be used at the veterinary clinic when echocardiography is not possible to perform.

Cats that are tachycardic (&gt;220) and/or have outflow obstruction (SAM) on echo should probably be treated but there is no cure for feline HCM. Many but not all cats have a heart murmur. Many cats that have a heart murmur do not have HCM. Frequently the first signs that a cat has HCM are tachypnea/dyspnea due to heart failure or acute pain and paralysis due to systemic thromboembolism. While medication is commonly given to cats with HCM that have no clinical signs, no medication is helpful at this stage and it has been shown that an ACE inhibitor is not beneficial until heart failure is present (at which time a diuretic is most beneficial). Diltiazem generally produces no demonstrable benefit. Atenolol is commonly administered when a severe systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve is present.

Feline arterial thromboembolism (FATE) is a relatively common and devastating complication of feline HCM and other feline cardiomyopathies. The thrombus generally forms in the left atrium, most commonly the left auricle. The formation is thought to be primarily due to blood flow stasis. Classically, the thromboembolism lodges at the iliac trifurcation of the aorta, occluding either one or both of the common iliac arteries. Because this split is called the saddle, and is the most frequent location for the thrombus, FATE is commonly known as saddle thrombus. Clinically this presents as a cat with complete loss of function in one or both hind limbs. The hind limbs are cold and the cat is in considerable pain. Emboli may, rarely, lodge in other locations, most commonly the right front limb and the renal arteries.

Clopidogrel is used to try to prevent left atrial thrombus formation in cats with HCM and a large left atrium. The FATCAT study at Purdue University demonstrated that it is superior to aspirin for the prevention of a second thrombus from forming in cats that have already experienced a clot. Thrombolytic agents (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) have been used with some success to break down existing aortic thromboembolism, but their cost is high and the outcome appears to be no better than giving a cat time (48–72 hours) to break down its own clot. Pain management is extremely important. The prognosis for cats with FATE is often poor as they are likely to have significant HCM already and a recurrent bout of FATE is likely. For this reason, euthanasia is often a valid consideration.

=== Gorillas ===
In July 2013, Rigo, a 42-year-old western lowland gorilla, resident in Melbourne Zoo and father of Mzuri, the first gorilla born by artificial insemination, died unexpectedly as a result of HCM. The condition is not uncommon in male gorillas over the age of 30, and in many cases, there is no sign of the disease until the individual&#x27;s sudden death.

<text>Thomas David Jones (born January 22, 1955) is a former United States astronaut. He was selected to the astronaut corps in 1990 and completed four Space Shuttle flights before retiring in 2001. He flew on STS-59 and STS-68 in 1994, STS-80 in 1996, and STS-98 in 2001. His total mission time was 53 days 48 minutes. He works as a planetary scientist, space operations consultant, astronaut speaker, and author.

==Background and education==
Jones was born January 22, 1955, in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from Kenwood High School, Essex, Maryland, in 1973; received a Bachelor of Science degree in Basic Sciences from the United States Air Force Academy in 1977, and a Doctorate in Planetary Science from the University of Arizona in 1988. Jones is a Distinguished Eagle Scout.

==Experience==
A Distinguished Graduate of the USAF Academy, Jones served on active duty as an Air Force officer for 6 years. After pilot training in Oklahoma, he flew strategic bombers at Carswell Air Force Base, Texas. As pilot and aircraft commander of a B-52 D Stratofortress, he led a combat crew of six, accumulating over 2,000 hours of jet experience before resigning as a captain in 1983.

From 1983 to 1988, Jones worked toward a Ph.D. at the University of Arizona in Tucson. His research interests included the remote sensing of asteroids, meteorite spectroscopy, and applications of space resources. From 1989 to 1990, he was a program management engineer in Washington, D.C., at the CIA&#x27;s Office of Development and Engineering. In 1990 he joined Science Applications International Corporation in Washington, D.C. as a senior scientist. Jones performed advanced program planning for NASA&#x27;s Solar System Exploration Division, investigating future robotic missions to Mars, asteroids, and the outer Solar System.

After a year of training following his selection by NASA in January 1990, Jones became an astronaut in July 1991. In 1994 he flew as a mission specialist on successive flights of . First, in April 1994, he ran science operations on the &quot;night shift&quot; during STS-59, the first flight of the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL-1). Then, in October 1994, he was the payload commander on the SRL-2 mission, STS-68. Jones next flew in late 1996 on . STS-80 successfully deployed and retrieved 2 science satellites, ORFEUS/SPAS and the Wake Shield Facility. While helping set a Shuttle endurance record of nearly 18 days in orbit, Jones used &quot;Columbia&quot;″s robot arm to release the Wake Shield satellite and later grapple it from orbit. His latest space flight was aboard on STS-98, in February 2001. Jones and his crew delivered the &quot;Destiny&quot; module to the International Space Station, (ISS) and he helped install the Lab in a series of three spacewalks lasting over 19 hours. The successful addition of &quot;Destiny&quot; gave the first Expedition Crew the largest space outpost in history and marked the start of onboard scientific research at the ISS. A veteran of four space flights, Jones has logged over 52 days (1,272 hours) in space.

Since leaving NASA in 2001, Jones has worked as a planetary scientist and consultant in space operations. He is a senior research scientist at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, engaged in planning robotic and astronaut expeditions to deep space and the near-Earth asteroids. He is also an author and speaker, with four adult, non-fiction works to his credit. From 2006 to 2009 he served on the NASA Advisory Council. He is a board member of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation.

He appears frequently as a science/space commentator on radio and television.

==Awards and decorations==
Jones&#x27;s awards include the NASA Space Flight Medal (four awards), NASA Distinguished Service Medal, NASA Exceptional Service Award, NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal, and NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal. His military decorations include the Air Force Commendation Medal. He was a distinguished graduate and the outstanding graduate in Basic Sciences at the United States Air Force Academy. King&#x27;s College in Wilkes-Barre, Penn. awarded him an honorary doctoral degree in 2007. The Main Belt asteroid 1082 TomJones is named in his honor.

Jones&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;Sky Walking: An Astronaut&#x27;s Memoir&quot;, was named one of the top five books on the subject of space by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Jones was inducted into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame on April 21, 2018.

<text>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood effectively. Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shortness of breath. It may also result in chest pain or fainting. Complications can include heart failure, heart valve disease, or an irregular heartbeat.
Causes include genetics, alcohol, cocaine, certain toxins, complications of pregnancy, and certain infections. Coronary artery disease and high blood pressure may play a role, but are not the primary cause. In many cases the cause remains unclear. It is a type of cardiomyopathy, a group of diseases that primarily affects the heart muscle. The diagnosis may be supported by an electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, or echocardiogram.
In those with heart failure, treatment may include medications in the ACE inhibitor, beta blocker, and diuretic families. A low salt diet may also be helpful. In those with certain types of irregular heartbeat, blood thinners or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator may be recommended. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may be necessary. If other measures are not effective a heart transplant may be an option in some.
About 1 per 2,500 people is affected. It occurs more frequently in men than women. Onset is most often in middle age. Five-year survival rate is about 50%. It can also occur in children and is the most common type of cardiomyopathy in this age group.

==Signs and symptoms==

Dilated cardiomyopathy develops insidiously, and may not initially cause symptoms significant enough to impact on quality of life. Nevertheless, many people experience significant symptoms. These might include:
* Shortness of breath
* Syncope (fainting)
* Angina, but only in the presence of ischemic heart disease

A person who has dilated cardiomyopathy may have an enlarged heart, with pulmonary edema and an elevated jugular venous pressure and a low pulse pressure. Signs of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation may be present.

==Causes==
Although in many cases no cause is apparent, dilated cardiomyopathy is probably the result of damage to the myocardium produced by a variety of toxic, metabolic, or infectious agents. In many cases the cause remains unclear. It may be due to fibrous change of the myocardium from a previous myocardial infarction. Or, it may be the late sequelae of acute viral myocarditis, such as with Coxsackie B virus and other enteroviruses possibly mediated through an immunologic mechanism. Specific autoantibodies are detectable in some cases.

Other causes include:
* Chagas disease, due to &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;. This is the most common infectious cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in Latin America
* Pregnancy: Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs late in gestation or several weeks to months postpartum as a peripartum cardiomyopathy. It is reversible in half of cases.
* Alcohol use disorder (alcoholic cardiomyopathy)
* Non-alcoholic toxic insults include administration of certain chemotherapeutic agents, in particular doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cobalt.
* Thyroid disease
* Inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis and connective tissue diseases
* Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
* Muscular dystrophy
* Tuberculosis: 1 to 2% of TB cases.
* Autoimmune mechanisms
* Thiamine deficiency

Recent studies have shown that those subjects with an extremely high occurrence (several thousands a day) of premature ventricular contractions (extrasystole) can develop dilated cardiomyopathy. In these cases, if the extrasystole are reduced or removed (for example, via ablation therapy) the cardiomyopathy usually regresses.

===Genetics===
About 25–35% of affected individuals have familial forms of the disease, with most mutations affecting genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins, while some affect other proteins involved in contraction. The disease is genetically heterogeneous, but the most common form of its transmission is an autosomal dominant pattern.
Autosomal recessive (as found, for example, in Alström syndrome), X-linked (as in Duchenne muscular dystrophy), and mitochondrial inheritance of the disease is also found. Some relatives of those affected by dilated cardiomyopathy have preclinical, asymptomatic heart-muscle changes.

Other cytoskeletal proteins involved in DCM include α-cardiac actin, desmin, and the nuclear lamins A and C. Mitochondrial deletions and mutations presumably cause DCM by altering myocardial ATP generation. Nuclear coding variations for mitochondrial complex II have also shown pathogenicity for dilated cardiomyopathy, designated 1GG for SDHA.

Kayvanpour et al. performed 2016 a meta-analysis with the largest dataset available on genotype-phenotype associations in DCM and mutations in lamin (LMNA), phospholamban (PLN), RNA Binding Motif Protein 20 (RBM20), Cardiac Myosin Binding Protein C (MYBPC3), Myosin Heavy Chain 7 (MYH7), Cardiac Troponin T 2 (TNNT2), and Cardiac Troponin I (TNNI3). They also reviewed recent studies investigating genotype-phenotype associations in DCM patients with titin (TTN) mutations. LMNA and PLN mutation carriers showed a high prevalence of cardiac transplantation and ventricular arrhythmia. Dysrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) was shown to occur even before the manifestation of DCM and heart failure symptoms in LMNA mutation carriers.

==Pathophysiology==

The progression of heart failure is associated with left ventricular remodeling, which manifests as gradual increases in left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, wall thinning, and a change in chamber geometry to a more spherical, less elongated shape. This process is usually associated with a continuous decline in ejection fraction. The concept of cardiac remodeling was initially developed to describe changes that occur in the days and months following myocardial infarction.

=== Compensation effects ===
As DCM progresses, two compensatory mechanisms are activated in response to impaired myocyte contractility and reduced stroke volume:
* Frank-Starling law
* Neurohormonal feedback, via activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system.
These responses initially compensate for decreased cardiac output and maintain those with DCM as asymptomatic. Eventually, however, these mechanisms become detrimental, intravascular volume becomes too great, and progressive dilatation leads to heart failure symptoms.

===Computational models===
Cardiac dilatation is a transversely isotropic, irreversible process resulting from excess strains on the myocardium. A computation model of volumetric, isotropic, and cardiac wall growth predicts the relationship between cardiac strains (e.g. volume overload after myocardial infarction) and dilation using the following governing equations:

formula_1

where formula_2 is elastic volume stretch that is reversible and formula_3 is irreversible, isotropic volume growth described by:

formula_4

where formula_5 is a vector, which points along a cardiomyocyte&#x27;s long axis and formula_6 is the cardiomyocyte stretch due to growth. The total cardiomyocyte growth is given by:

formula_7

The above model reveals a gradual dilation of the myocardium, especially the ventricular myocardium, to support the blood volume overload in the chambers. Dilation manifests itself in an increase in total cardiac mass and cardiac diameter. Cardiomyocytes reach their maximum length of 150 formula_8m in the endocardium and 130 formula_8m in the epicardium by the addition of sarcomeres. Due to the increase in diameter, the dilated heart appears spherical in shape, as opposed the elliptical shape of a healthy human heart. In addition, the ventricular walls maintain the same thickness, characteristic of pathophysiological cardiac dilation.

=== Valvular effects ===
As the ventricles enlarge, both the mitral and tricuspid valves may lose their ability to come together properly. This loss of coaptation may lead to mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. As a result, those with DCM are at increased risk of atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, stroke volume is decreased and a greater volume load is placed on the ventricle, thus increasing heart failure symptoms.

==Diagnosis==


Generalized enlargement of the heart is seen upon normal chest X-ray. Pleural effusion may also be noticed, which is due to pulmonary venous hypertension.

The electrocardiogram often shows sinus tachycardia or atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias, left atrial enlargement, and sometimes intraventricular conduction defects and low voltage. When left bundle-branch block (LBBB) is accompanied by right axis deviation (RAD), the rare combination is considered to be highly suggestive of dilated or congestive cardiomyopathy. Echocardiogram shows left ventricular dilatation with normal or thinned walls and reduced ejection fraction. Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography are often performed to exclude ischemic heart disease.

Genetic testing can be important, since one study has shown that gene mutations in the TTN gene (which codes for a protein called titin) are responsible for &quot;approximately 25% of familial cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 18% of sporadic cases.&quot; The results of the genetic testing can help the doctors and patients understand the underlying cause of the dilated cardiomyopathy. Genetic test results can also help guide decisions on whether a patient&#x27;s relatives should undergo genetic testing (to see if they have the same genetic mutation) and cardiac testing to screen for early findings of dilated cardiomyopathy.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI) may also provide helpful diagnostic information in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

==Treatment==

=== Medical therapy ===
Drug therapy can slow down progression and in some cases even improve the heart condition. Standard therapy may include salt restriction, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and beta blockers. Anticoagulants may also be used for antithrombotic therapy. There is some evidence for the benefits of coenzyme Q10 in treating heart failure.

K-strophanthin may improve functional performance in patients with severe cardiac decompensation while digoxin raises cardiac output and ejection fraction only at rest.

=== Electrical treatment ===
Artificial pacemakers may be used in patients with intraventricular conduction delay, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in those at risk of arrhythmia. These forms of treatment have been shown to prevent sudden cardiac death, improve symptoms, and reduce hospitalization in patients with systolic heart failure. In addition, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should be considered as a therapeutic option for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients with a confirmed LMNA mutation responsible for dilated cardiomyopathy disease phenotype and clinical risk factors. A novel risk score calculator has been developed that allows calculation of risk of sustained ventricular arrhythmia in the next 5 years in patients with DCM. https://www.ikard.pl/SVA/ 

=== Surgical treatment ===
In patients with advanced disease who are refractory to medical therapy, heart transplantation may be considered. For these people, 1-year survival approaches 90% and over 50% survive greater than 20 years.

== Epidemiology ==
Although the disease is more common in African-Americans than in Caucasians, it may occur in any patient population.

== Research directions ==
Therapies that support reverse remodeling have been investigated, and this may suggests a new approach to the prognosis of cardiomyopathies (see ventricular remodeling).

==Animals==
In some types of animals, both a hereditary and acquired version of dilated cardiomyopathy has been documented.

=== Dogs ===
Dilated cardiomyopathy is a heritable disease in some dog breeds, including the Boxer, Dobermann, Great Dane, Irish Wolfhound, and St Bernard. Treatment is based on medication, including ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors.

An acquired variation of dilated cardiomyopathy describing a link between certain diets was discovered in 2019 by researchers at University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine who published a report on the development of dilated cardiomyopathy in dog breeds lacking the genetic predisposition, particularly in Golden Retrievers. The diets associated with DCM were described as &quot;BEG&quot; (boutique, exotic-ingredient, and/or grain-free) dog foods, as well as legume-rich diets. For treating diet-related DCM, food changes, taurine and carnitine supplementation may be indicated even if the dog does not have a documented taurine or carnitine deficiency although the cost of carnitine supplementation may be viewed as prohibitive by some

=== Cats ===
Dilated cardiomyopathy is also a disease affecting some cat breeds, including the Oriental Shorthair, Burmese, Persian, and Abyssinian. In cats, taurine deficiency is the most common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy. As opposed to these hereditary forms, non-hereditary DCM used to be common in the overall cat population before the addition of taurine to commercial cat food.

=== Other animals ===
There is also a high incidence of heritable dilated cardiomyopathy in captive golden hamsters (&quot;Mesocricetus auratus&quot;), due in no small part to their being highly inbred. The incidence is high enough that several strains of Golden Hamster have been developed to serve as animal models in clinical testing for human forms of the disease.

<doc id="606014" wikidata="Q3441887" url="?curid=606014" title="Elementary, Dear Data">
<text>&quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot; is the third episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the 29th episode overall. It was written by Brian Alan Lane and directed by Rob Bowman. It was originally released on December 5, 1988, in broadcast syndication.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. In this episode, a holographic adversary is created on the holodeck of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; when Data and Geordi take some time off to play a Sherlock Holmes game. The plot line from this episode was continued in the sixth season episode &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot;, and the Moriarty character appeared a third time in &quot;The Bounty&quot; (the sixth episode of Star Trek: Picard season 3).

In 1989, &quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot; was nominated for two Emmy Awards: Outstanding Art Direction for a Series, Richard D. James, Art Director; Jim Mees, Set Decorator and Outstanding Costume Design for a Series, Durinda Wood, Costume Designer; William Ware Theiss, Starfleet Uniforms Creator.

==Plot==
As the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, waits to rendezvous with the USS &quot;Victory&quot;, Chief Engineer La Forge and Commander Data go to the holodeck to recreate a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Data, playing Holmes, has memorized all of the Holmes stories, and recognizes and solves the mystery within minutes. Frustrated, Geordi leaves the holodeck, leaving Data confused. In Ten Forward, Geordi explains that the fun is in solving the unknown; Data does not understand. Overhearing their conversation, Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pulaski asserts that Data is incapable of solving a mystery to which he does not already know the outcome. Data accepts Dr. Pulaski&#x27;s challenge and invites her to join them on the holodeck. There, Geordi instructs the computer to create a unique Sherlock Holmes mystery with an adversary who is capable of defeating Data.

In the new program, Dr. Pulaski is kidnapped, and Data investigates. They soon discover that Professor Moriarty is responsible, but when they find him with Pulaski in his hideout, they are shocked when they learn that Moriarty is aware of the holodeck program being a simulation, and is able to access the holodeck computer, showing them a sketch of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; he has drawn based on the computer&#x27;s description. Data and Geordi leave the holodeck to alert the captain, and Geordi realizes that when he asked the computer to create the program he had asked for an adversary who could defeat Data, not Sherlock Holmes; as a result, the computer gave the holodeck character, Professor Moriarty, the intelligence and cunning needed to challenge Data, plus the ability to access the ship&#x27;s computer. When Moriarty gains access to ship stabilizer controls, Data returns to the holodeck with Captain Picard.

Picard meets Moriarty, who demonstrates that he has evolved beyond his original programming and asks to continue to exist in the real world. Picard tells Moriarty that this would not be possible; instead, he saves the program and tells Moriarty that if they ever discover a way to convert holodeck matter into a permanent form they will bring him back. Picard discontinues the program and the USS &quot;Victory&quot; arrives, with La Forge preparing to present a model of the historic HMS &quot;Victory&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot; was written by Brian Alan Lane and directed by Rob Bowman.

===Story and script===
This episode contains elements from and references to the Sherlock Holmes short stories &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, &quot;The Red-Headed League&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Speckled Band&quot;, and &quot;The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans&quot;, as well as the Holmes novel &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;. Furthermore, Moriarty&#x27;s creation being a result of Geordi La Forge requesting an opponent capable of defeating Data references Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s creation of the same character for the short story &quot;The Final Problem&quot; – specifically, as an opponent capable of defeating Sherlock Holmes who, at the time, Doyle wanted to kill off.

Reportedly, the original ending had Jean-Luc Picard lying to Moriarty, that he could have existed outside the holodeck, the same way the piece of paper on which he drew the &quot;Enterprise&quot; also stayed intact outside the holodeck. Co-executive producer Maurice Hurley wanted to keep that ending, as it made Picard look clever, but Gene Roddenberry nixed it, saying it made Picard look cruel. Instead, the paper stays intact without any explanation.

===Casting===
The episode features Daniel Davis as James Moriarty. Daniel Davis used an English accent for this role, though he is from Arkansas and speaks with an American accent when not in character. Davis was auditioning for the role of Moriarty alongside another actor in the room Brian Bedford directly in front of director Rob Bowman. Davis said of being in the room with Brian Bedford, &quot;So he&#x27;s the standout in my mind, and we were sort of taking bets with each other about which of us would get it. We hadn&#x27;t worked together or seen each other in a long time. So it was a very friendly rivalry. Then, when I got it, he was a very good sport and invited me to come to dinner to celebrate that I had gotten the part.&quot;

The episode also features Anne Elizabeth Ramsay, making her first &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; appearance as Ensign Clancy. The actress reprised the role in &quot;The Emissary&quot;, also in season two. Ramsay went on to a busy career as an actress. She co-starred as Lisa Stemple, the dysfunctional sister of Helen Hunt&#x27;s character, in 123 episodes of &quot;Mad About You&quot;, for which she shared a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. Ramsay also played a recurring role on &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;Dexter&quot;.

==Reception==
In 1989, the episode was nominated for two Emmy awards.

In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated &quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot; the 10th best episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and the 26th best of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes to date. James Hunt of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; gave it a 100% watch rating and remarked it was &quot;fantastic episode&quot;. In particular he praised concepts explored about computers and artificial intelligence as well as the Data and Geordi character sequences. &quot;Tor.com&quot; rated it 7 out of 10.

The episode&#x27;s title &quot;Elementary, Dear Data&quot; was noted as a play on the iconic but false Sherlock Holmes phrase &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson&quot;.

In 2011, this episode was noted by &quot;Forbes&quot; as one that explores the implications of advanced technology, in this case for exploring an apparently self-aware software program.
In 2016, &quot;Time&quot; magazine rated the holographic Professor Moriarty as the 5th best villain of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2020, &quot;Looper&quot; listed this as one of the best episodes for Data, remarking that it is &quot;&quot;The Next Generation&quot; having a whole lot of fun&quot;; Geordi and Data tackle a holodeck gone wrong plot, with a Sherlock Holmes theme.

<text>A beach armoured recovery vehicle (BARV) is an armoured recovery vehicle used for amphibious landings.

There have been three different BARVs in British service since their introduction during World War II. They have also been used by Dutch and Australian forces.

==Sherman BARV==

The original BARV was a Sherman M4A2 tank which had been waterproofed and had the turret replaced by a tall armoured superstructure. Around 60 were deployed on the invasion beaches during the Battle of Normandy. Able to operate in deep water, the BARV was used to remove vehicles that had become broken-down or swamped in the surf and were blocking access to the beaches. They were also used to re-float small landing craft that had become stuck on the beach. Unusually for a tank, the crew included a diver whose job was to attach towing chains to stuck vehicles.

The vehicles were developed and operated by the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. The Sherman M4A2 model was chosen as a basis for the BARV as it was thought that the Sherman&#x27;s welded hull would be easier to waterproof than other tanks. Unlike other Sherman models, the M4A2 was powered by a diesel engine because it was believed the tank would be less affected by the sudden temperature changes caused by the regular plunges into cold water. A few Sherman BARVs continued to be used until 1963, when they were replaced by a vehicle based on the Centurion tank.

==M3 BARV==

A single M3A5 Grant tank was converted into a BARV in 1950 by the Australian Army. This remained in service until 1970.

==Centurion BARV==
By the late 1950s, Sherman BARVs were becoming less useful as they were unable to recover the heavier armoured vehicles that were being introduced. The &quot;Centurion BARV FV 4018&quot; was developed as a replacement. A mild-steel prototype was followed in 1960 by 12 production vehicles. These were based on the hulls of Mark 1, 2, and 3 Centurion tanks that by this time were redundant. Although initially assigned to the Army, they were passed to the Royal Marines when the Army&#x27;s amphibious assault role was given to the marines. The BARV was basically a Centurion body with built up sides to accommodate wading in water up to 11 feet. The design was functional yet crude with sloped armour built above the tank hull. The tracks for the BARV were reversed so they had better grip biting in reverse.
The Centurion BARV retained the gun-tank&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Meteor petrol engine.

Centurion BARVs had a crew of four; two of the crew were members of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, one of whom was a qualified diver.
The Centurion BARVs were built to provide the essential role for the LPD&#x27;s HMS &quot;Fearless&quot; and HMS &quot;Intrepid&quot; as part of the beach assault squadrons.

The assault squadrons were initially a mix of Royal Marines and Army serving aboard the ships. The transition to this being all Royal Marines was seen to be essential.
The crew for the BARVs would be handed to the Royal Marines with a sergeant, two corporals and a marine, all qualified vehicle mechanics, responsible for driving and maintaining the tank, and also providing full mechanical breakdown services for all embarked vehicles.
The training for the crew would take place at Bovington Camp for driver training and at the home of the BARV, RM Instow in North Devon, the Royal Marines&#x27; amphibious testing centre.

There were many occasions when the BARV would break down or get stuck. In 1981 the BARV from &quot;Fearless&quot; was to be lost at sea off Browndown beach to end up fully submerged. The following year both BARVs would see service during the Falklands War, being the largest land vehicles ashore, with the BARV from &quot;Fearless&quot; becoming stuck in deep mud whilst pushing an LCU Blue Beach. The vehicle was stuck in the mud for a few days, while a quillshaft (driveshaft between transmission and final drive unit) snapped during the recovery. The BARV from HMS &quot;Intrepid&quot; also became stuck in deep mud and suffered the same quillshaft failure and remained static for the duration of the war.

All the Centurion-derived BARVs have now left service and have been sold to collectors or museums around the world. BARV registration number 00ZR21 can be seen at the RAC Tank Museum, Bovington England.

==Hippo BRV==
In 2003, the Centurion BARV&#x27;s replacement was introduced. This is the &quot;Hippo BRV&quot;, which had been in development under the project name of &quot;Future Beach Recovery Vehicle&quot; (FBRV). The name change reflects the fact that, unlike previous generations of vehicle used in this role, &quot;Hippos&quot; are not fully armored.

The &quot;Hippo&quot; is a conversion by Alvis Moelv of a Leopard 1A5 tank. The incorporation of Alvis Vickers into BAE Systems meant that elements of the work moved to BAE Land Systems, Sweden, formerly known as &quot;Hägglunds&quot;, another ex-Alvis company. As with earlier generations of BARV, the main alteration has been the replacement of the turret with a raised superstructure which, in this case, resembles the bridge or wheelhouse of a small ship. The original diesel engine has been retained but the gearing of the transmission had been lowered; this has reduced the vehicle&#x27;s road speed from , but its tractive force has been increased to . Other modifications include the addition of working platforms, a nosing block, raised air intakes and an auxiliary power unit; this has raised the weight of the vehicle from 42.5 tonnes to 50 tonnes. The Hippo has a fording depth of and can pull vehicles up to 50 tonnes weight or push off from the beach a 240 tonne displacement landing craft.

Currently, four Hippos are in British service, one each on HMS &quot;Albion&quot; and &quot;Bulwark&quot;, with two used by 11 Amphibious Trials and Training Unit Royal Marines. The vehicle is reportedly well liked by its users, but its lack of commonality with the other armoured vehicles used by the UK has caused spares support problems, exacerbated by the poor nature of the Initial Spares Support package procured from Alvis Moelv by the UK&#x27;s Defence Procurement Agency. This area is being tackled by the MoD&#x27;s Defence Logistics Organisation.

The Netherlands Marine Corps operates four similar Dutch Leopard 1V-based BRV vehicles known as &quot;Hercules&quot;, &quot;Samson&quot;, &quot;Goliath&quot; and &quot;Titan&quot; which operate out of the Royal Netherlands Navy assault ships of the &quot;Rotterdam&quot; class. The vehicles have a similar specification but a different cabin appearance.

==Survivors==

In England, the REME Museum in Lyneham and the D-Day Story in Portsmouth both have Sherman BARVs on display. Another, in running condition, is held by the &quot;War and Peace Collection&quot;, a private military collection in the UK. The wrecked hulk of another is at The Tank Museum, after being used as a firing range target. Another Sherman BARV is a museum-piece in India, at the Cavalry Tank Museum, Ahmednagar. The Australian M3 BARV is preserved at the Royal Australian Armoured Corps Tank Museum at Puckapunyal, Australia. The museum also has a second BARV that was based on a bulldozer.

Centurion BARVs are on display at The Tank Museum (UK), at Yad La-Shiryon in Latrun - the IDF tank museum - and at the Israel Defense Forces History Museum (&quot;Batey ha-Osef&quot;) in Tel-Aviv. A Centurion BARV, in private hands, is parked and able to be viewed at the entrance of a farm on Colne Road, Bures Hamlet, Essex, England.

AeroVenture in Doncaster, UK has a Centurion BARV &quot;02 ZR 77&quot; on display as part of its Falklands War Collection. This was originally one of the first Centurions built as part of the first contract between 1944 and 1946 (the exact date of build is unknown). It was one of the two BARVs that took part in Operation Sutton, the British landings at San Carlos with one from HMS &quot;Fearless&quot; supporting the landings on Blue Beach and one from HMS &quot;Intrepid&quot; supporting the landings on Red Beach and remains the longest-serving armoured vehicle in the British forces, leaving service in 2005 after taking part in both Gulf conflicts.

<text>Hans Guido Mutke (25 March 1921 – 8 April 2004) was a fighter pilot for the German Luftwaffe during World War II. He was born in Neisse, Upper Silesia (now Nysa, Poland).

On 25 April 1945, Mutke landed at Dübendorf, Switzerland, flying the Me 262A-1a jet fighter, &#x27;White 3&#x27;, from 9. &quot;Staffel&quot;, &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 7. He claimed that he got lost during a combat mission and landed there by mistake, although there were suspicions that he&#x27;d defected. The Swiss authorities never attempted to fly the plane, keeping it in storage and returning it to Germany on 30 August 1957. He sued the post-war German government, unsuccessfully, for the return of the plane, claiming it was his own property.

Mutke also made the controversial claim that he broke the sound barrier in 1945 in an Me 262, but mainstream opinion continues to regard Chuck Yeager as the first person to achieve this milestone in 1947 in a Bell X-1.

==The dive==

On 9 April 1945, &quot;Fähnrich&quot; Mutke, part of the &quot;Ergänzungs-Jagdgeschwader 2&quot; (EJG 2) conversion squadron, 3rd flight, took off from Lagerlechfeld in his Messerschmitt Me 262, marked &quot;Weiße 9&quot;, for a planned high-altitude flight. He was climbing through at an altitude of 12,000 m (36,000 ft) in near perfect weather with a visibility of over , listening to the radio conversations, when his chief instructor Oberstleutnant Heinz Bär detected a P-51 Mustang approaching the plane of a comrade, Unteroffizier Achammer, from behind.

Mutke went into a steep 40° dive with full engine power. While passing through the altitude of , his Me 262 started to vibrate and began swinging from side to side. The airspeed indicator was stuck against its limit of 1,100 km/h (684 mph) (the maximum speed of the Me 262 is ). The speed of sound is 1,062 km/h (660 mph) at an altitude of , depending on the environmental variables. The shaking intensified, and Mutke temporarily lost control of his plane. He reported that with the airspeed indicator still off the scale he attempted to recover from the uncontrollable dive by adjusting the main tailplane incidence angle. Rather than just having a hinged elevator, the Me 262 could change the angle of incidence of the whole tailplane, a design feature that was later added to the Bell X1. Suddenly, the buffeting stopped, and control resumed for a few seconds. Mutke throttled back and his engines flamed out, and after the short period of smooth flight, the buffeting resumed and the aircraft began shaking violently again. He fought to regain control and re-light the engines eventually reducing the speed below . After a difficult landing, it was found that his plane was missing many rivets and also had distorted wings.

==Claims==

At the time, Mutke did not understand the reasons for this strange behavior. Only after learning about the supersonic flights of Chuck Yeager in 1947 did he attribute these phenomena to the effects of supersonic flight and claim to have broken the sound barrier—years before Yeager did. This claim is disputed, and there are a number of other pilots and countries that claim the first supersonic flight. However, Mutke never claimed he was the first person to break the sound barrier, but instead argued that his flight was merely proof that the Me 262 was capable of reaching and exceeding Mach 1 and that therefore other German fighter pilots may have done so even before him.

In a series of carefully controlled flight tests conducted in World War II by Messerschmitt, it was established that the Me 262 went out of control in a dive at Mach 0.86, and that higher Mach numbers would lead to a nose-down trim that could not be counter-acted by the pilot by use of the control column. The resulting steepening of the dive would lead to even higher speeds and self-destruction of the airframe due to excessive negative G loads. Postwar testing by the British government corroborated Messerschmitt&#x27;s results, though neither actually exceeded Mach 0.86.

Mutke claimed to have overcome the ever steepening dive by adjustment of the 262&#x27;s tailplane incidence. This is the same technique employed by Chuck Yeager in the Bell X-1 to avoid what is known as Mach tuck. Furthermore, Mutke&#x27;s observation that he briefly regained control of the aircraft, while still accelerating, corresponds with later accounts of supersonic flight.

After the war, American test pilots filed reports about the Me 262, including the possibility of a speed of Mach 1. Compressibility in pitot tubes of the time often resulted in exaggerated speed readings near the speed of sound, particularly in German equipment, which was adversely affected by supply shortages as the war progressed. American Sabrejets and other high-speed aircraft (including the Bell X-1) also experienced anomalous airspeed readings in the high-subsonic flight regime (between 0.8 Mach and Mach 1). The Me 262&#x27;s pre-area rule fuselage would have additionally resulted in very high transonic drag, and its engines were already underpowered and temperamental to begin with. However, aircraft such as the Bell X-1, F-86 Sabre and Convair F2Y Sea Dart similarly did not have area ruled fuselages, yet are acknowledged to have flown at supersonic speeds — here the engine thrust, either alone or in combination with the pull of gravity during a dive, supplies enough force to accelerate the airplane to supersonic speed.

Due to the nature of Mutke&#x27;s combat flight, it is impossible to determine the exact speed of his plane, and it is also difficult to estimate the exact speed of sound at that temperature and altitude. Therefore, it is not possible to either prove or disprove his claims, and there is much discussion among experts as to whether the Me 262 was able to reach the speed of sound. It is believed that the damaging effects experienced by Mutke were a side effect of supersonic airstream and shock waves over different parts of the airframe, called buffeting. This effect occurs at speeds approaching Mach 1 but ceases above Mach 1. A number of other Me 262 experienced similar strange accidents, or breaking apart in the sky because of buffeting and the different aerodynamics at the sound barrier. Transonic buffeting effects had also been widely reported by pilots of propeller-driven Allied fighters including the Supermarine Spitfire, P-38 Lightning, P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang, aircraft that were known to have top diving speeds of less than Mach 0.85 (although one Spitfire was measured at Mach 0.92). Allied fighter pilots reported seeing supersonic shock waves and popped rivets during dives as the high-speed air rushing over the wing exceeded Mach 1 even though the forward airspeed of the overall aircraft was well below that speed.

Many proponents of the claim also believe that after the end of the war the Allied powers had no interest in emphasizing any German achievements during the war. Mutke&#x27;s claim, however, is without controlled, experimental confirmation.

A computer-based performance analysis of the Me 262 carried out in 1999 at the Technische Universität München concluded that the Me 262 could indeed exceed Mach 1 .

==After World War II==

After the war, Mutke moved to Argentina, where he flew Douglas DC-3s for several airlines. He later returned to Germany, where he completed medical training. He died in Munich in 2004, during a heart valve operation. He donated his bodily remains to the anatomist Gunther von Hagens.

<doc id="606022" wikidata="Q1544881" url="?curid=606022" title="University of Tampere">
<text>The University of Tampere (UTA) (, ) was a public university in Tampere, Finland that was merged with Tampere University of Technology to create the new Tampere University on 1 January 2019.

The university offered undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes with 20,178 degree students and 1,981 employees as of 2016. Founded in 1925 in Helsinki as the Civic College () and from 1930 onwards known as the School of Social Sciences (), the institution relocated to Tampere in 1960 and was renamed as the University of Tampere in 1966. In 2016, its budget was €184.6 million of which 59% was government funding.

==History==
The institution was established in 1925 as the Civic College in Helsinki teaching public administration, organisation management and journalism with an inaugural intake of 72 students. In 1930, a total of 195 students were enrolled at the college and its name was amended to the School of Social Sciences. Similarly, the institution&#x27;s vocationally oriented bachelor&#x27;s degrees were expanded into municipal administration, public law, child protection, and civic education as well as a master&#x27;s degree in social sciences.

The first faculty, the Faculty of Social Sciences, was established in 1949 and the number of students steadily increased from 227 in 1940 to 661 in 1950. The programmes offered by the school grew, such as degrees in social and youth work, librarianship and economics as well as a prison officer&#x27;s diploma. The first doctoral degree was completed in 1955 and in 1956, the City of Tampere and the School of Social Sciences agreed on relocating the school to Tampere. By 1960, the number of students had increased to 933 and the School of Social Sciences moved to its new Päätalo main building, designed by Toivo Korhonen, at Kalevantie 4, Tampere. After the Faculty of Humanities and the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration were established in 1964 and 1965, respectively, the School of Social Sciences was renamed as the University of Tampere in 1966.

A programme, called Tampere3, to merge the university with Tampere University of Technology and Tampere University of Applied Sciences was started in the spring of 2014. The merger was approved by Parliament in December 2017 and came into effect on 1 January 2019. The new foundation-based interdisciplinary higher education institution was named Tampere University after the proposed name of Tampere New University faced criticism.

== Academics ==

A total of 14,712 degree students studied at the University of Tampere in 2016, including 11,810 students in bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degree programmes and 1,646 doctoral students. Likewise in 2016, the university received 17,482 applications of whom 1,418 were enrolled for an admission rate of 8.1%. It hosted four centres of excellence in research, such as on mitochondrial disease and in Russian studies, as of 2016. As of 2017, a tuition fee of approximately 10,000 euros was charged in general from non-European Union/European Economic Area citizens studying in the English-taught master&#x27;s degree programmes with 50% or 100% cover scholarships available. Other students, such as exchange or doctoral students, were exempt from fees. The university was ranked 201–250 on the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2018. Likewise, it ranked 551–600 on the QS World University Rankings 2018 and 101–150 on its Communication and Media Studies category.

== Campus ==
The University of Tampere had two campuses in Tampere: the main campus in the centre, near the Tampere railway station, and the Kauppi campus next to the Tampere University Hospital. The main campus hosted most of the faculties and comprised the Päätalo, Pinni, Linna and Virta buildings while the Faculty of Medicine and Life Sciences and Laboratory Services are located at the Arvo building in the Kauppi campus. The Päätalo building was completed in 1960 and served as the university&#x27;s first premises at Tampere. The Pinni complex was completed gradually during the 1990s and 2000s and the Linna and Virta buildings were ready for use in 2006 and 2009, respectively. The medicine-focused Arvo building was built in two separate phases reached in 2009 and 2016. The floor area of the university&#x27;s facilities totaled 130,134 m2 as of 2016. Instead of dormitories at the campuses, the Tampere Student Housing Foundation rented apartments to students around Tampere.

<doc id="606023" wikidata="Q1931762" url="?curid=606023" title="Mid Scotland and Fife (Scottish Parliament electoral region)">
<text>Mid Scotland and Fife is one of the eight electoral regions of the Scottish Parliament which were created in 1999. Nine of the parliament&#x27;s 73 first past the post constituencies are sub-divisions of the region and it elects seven of the 56 additional-member Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Thus it elects a total of 16 MSPs.

The Mid Scotland and Fife region shares boundaries with the Central Scotland, Highlands and Islands, North East Scotland and West of Scotland regions and is connected with the Lothian region by bridges across the Firth of Forth.

==Constituencies and council areas==

===2011–present===
As a result of the First Periodic Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries the boundaries for the region and constituencies were redrawn for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.

===1999–2011===
The constituencies were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of Westminster constituencies, as existing in at that time. The Holyrood constituencies cover all of three council areas, the Clackmannanshire council area, the Fife council area and the Stirling council area, most of the Perth and Kinross council area and part of the Angus council area.

The rest of the Angus council area is within the North East Scotland electoral region.

<text>The Crypt of Civilization is an impenetrable, airtight, room-sized time capsule, built between 1937 and 1940, at Oglethorpe University in Brookhaven, Georgia. The repository is meant not to be opened before 8113 AD. It contains numerous artifacts and sound recordings that illustrate civilization and human development to the 20th century. Classic literature and religious texts were also deposited, as well as items showing the extent of scientific progress to 1939.

Thornwell Jacobs, the initiator of the project, was inspired by the opening of Egyptian pyramids and wanted to create a repository of everyday 1930s objects and a record of human knowledge over the preceding 6,000 years. The Guinness Book of Records declared the Crypt to be the first genuine attempt to permanently preserve a record of 20th century culture for people of thousands of years into the future.

==Beginnings==

Thornwell Jacobs (1877–1956), President of Oglethorpe University from 1915 to 1944, is considered the father of modern time capsules by historian Paul Stephen Hudson. Jacobs was engaged in research in the 1920s for one of his books when he was astounded by the meager amount of detailed information available about ancient Egyptian life. He realized that practically all the accumulated knowledge we had of the civilization was based on two incomplete sources. One being the items found in tombs of the Pharaohs of Egypt and the kings of Sumeria and Babylonia. The second was from rock inscriptions and tablets found in ancient Assyria. He determined that while the ancient items found gave some degree of life events from thousands of years ago there were no complete and accurate records on any single generation of how people lived.

Jacobs&#x27; vision was to make available to some civilization far in the future a kind of latter-day Egyptian style tomb of a complete cross section record of physical and visual items showing the life and traditions that people had developed to the time of the closing of the crypt. In 1935, he discussed this idea with the editor of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, Orson Munn, and he promised to use the magazine to publicize the project. In November 1936 an article was published describing the time capsule project. Jacobs sought the help of scientist Thomas K. Peters and the project was started in August 1937. By June 1940 they had collected all the items they thought represented human life on earth of the previous 6000 years. Jacobs calculated that 6,177 years had passed since the start of the Egyptian calendar and proposed the creation of a Crypt of Civilization to be opened in 8113 CE after another 6,177 years.

The Crypt of Civilization was constructed in the swimming pool in the basement of the Phoebe Hearst Hall at Oglethorpe University. The swimming pool was modified into an airtight chamber, measuring long, high and wide, which was remodeled between 1937 and 1940. It sits on a bedrock floor and has a stone roof thick. The walls are lined with plates of enamel, secured in place with pitch. The stainless steel doorway was welded permanently closed after the oxygen had been removed and replaced with inert nitrogen. Peters supervised construction and served as the Crypt&#x27;s archivist who would represent the current civilization. The project was financed by industrialists and philanthropists. The crypt was deeded to the United States government, its heirs and assigns, to be held in trust for the people of the 82nd century.

==Contents==
The Bureau of Standards was consulted on the design of the Crypt and advised how artifacts should be stored. The chamber resembles a room of an ancient Egyptian pyramid with artifacts placed on shelves and the floor. Many items are stored in stainless steel holders, lined with glass and filled with an inert gas to prevent aging, a concept later carried over to the Westinghouse Time Capsules. The walls are painted with pictographs by George L. Carlson that show the history of intelligence and human development. There is a small windmill inside the vault that will make electricity to operate the electrical items buried in the time capsule.

Many of the artifacts were donated and contributions were received from the King of Sweden Gustav V and Eastman Kodak. Suggestions for items that were accepted for the chamber included a mechanical pencil, a fountain pen and a can opener. Other artifacts deposited were seed samples, dental floss, a woman&#x27;s purse with typical contents, some Artie Shaw records, an electric toaster, a pacifier, a bottle of Budweiser beer encapsulated in special material for preservation, a manual typewriter, an electronic radio, a store cash register, an office adding machine, and an electric sewing machine. Children&#x27;s toys were deposited as well, including Lincoln Logs, a plastic Donald Duck, a miniature plastic statue of the Lone Ranger, and a cloth and wooden black doll. Also placed in the crypt were miniature reproductions of some of the most famous sculptures ever made.
Airtight canisters containing cellulose acetate film were also placed into the chamber. These microfilms contain more than 800 standard books of literature (over 600,000 pages), including the Christian Bible, the Quran, Homer&#x27;s &quot;Song of Ilium&quot;, and Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. An original manuscript &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; film was donated by movie producer David O. Selznick. AMORC was asked by Peters to send from their archives manuscripts of their philosophy to be deposited inside the Crypt time vault with the other artifacts that are to be seen by those of 8113 CE when the time capsule reopens. Collected also for the time treasure was film on Ohio&#x27;s industrial and historical scenes including travelogues and agricultural scenes of the state. There are also glass bell jars that hold less than life size models of men and women dressed in 1930s clothing.

The crypt contains voice recordings of leaders from the 1930s, including Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Benito Mussolini. The sounds of Popeye the Sailor Man and a professional pig caller were stored inside the crypt. Peters, the archivist, placed electric microfilm readers and picture projectors in the chamber to allow future generations to view and listen to the recordings. He also provided a windmill to generate electricity to run the devices, as well as a magnifier for the microfilm records, should electricity not be in general use by the 82nd century. Engraved steel panels of the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; newspaper showing reports from the first year of World War II, were also placed in the crypt.

An array of contemporary scientific instruments were gathered for the crypt such as an altimeter and a barometer, as well as common appliances like a telephone and a television. Peters also left behind a device of his innovation called a &quot;Language Integrator&quot;, a modified Mutoscope that was a hand-operated movie projector with sound that would teach English to the future generation that came upon the crypt. This was a type of Rosetta Stone and another concept carried forward to the Westinghouse Time Capsules. Peters also delivered a film he had made about the crypt entitled &quot;The Stream of Knowledge&quot; that was published in 1938. Jacobs left a written note for those opening the crypt in 8113 CE, in which he hoped for future efforts in preservation. He pointed out that the world had been engaged in scientifically preserving the human civilization customs and culture for future generations, and in this crypt it had been presented to these people.

==Promotion==

In 1937, Jacobs spoke on the National Broadcasting Company in New York to promote the Crypt on nationwide radio. A dedication ceremony at the Oglethorpe University campus took place in May 1938, led by David Sarnoff of Radio Corporation of America and the Paramount newsreels of the occasion were later placed in the crypt. Metal cards were sold to the public by the university for one dollar, which would permit a future descendant of the contributor to attend the reentering of the crypt at noon on Thursday, May 28, 8113. The location of this repository of civilization items was a concern of the far future civilization being able to know of it and its whereabouts so a system was devised. Directions to the Crypt of Civilization in the state of Georgia in southeastern United States was written in seven Asiatic and seven European languages and deposited in various type libraries all over the world. The information provided told of its contents and showed its location in relation to reference points like Stone Mountain.

Jacobs and Peters permanently closed off the crypt in a ceremony that was announced in a newscast by Atlanta&#x27;s WSB radio May 25, 1940. Notable figures present at the ceremony were Dr. Amos Ettinger, William B. Hartsfield, Dr. M. D. Collins, Ivan Allen, Jr., politician E. D. Rivers, postmaster James Farley and Pulitzer Prize winner Clark Howell. The door was welded shut, and a plaque was fused to it with a message to the people of 8113 CE from Jacobs. In 1990, Guinness World Records wrote that the vault was the first genuine attempt that successfully preserved permanently a record of 20th-century cultural objects for any future inhabitants of Earth or visitors that may come to the unoccupied planet.

==Legacy==

The Crypt of Civilization intrigued America and was replicated by many others. George Edward Pendray, a public relations executive in the mid-1930s, created the Westinghouse time capsule for a public ceremony for the 1939–40 New York World&#x27;s Fair, to raise awareness of his company&#x27;s repository vault. The rocket-shaped vessel, with a exterior made from the metal alloy cupaloy, contained a Pyrex inner tube in which articles were placed. Pendray&#x27;s design was originally called a &quot;time bomb&quot;, but the name was later changed to avoid an association with warfare. Pendray chose the name &quot;time capsule&quot; as it encapsulated within a container man-made objects and was intended to be opened in 61 centuries. A second capsule was created by Westinghouse for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair and an exhibit was set up to show the contents and history of the time capsules. Both these capsules are intended to be available to the people of 6939 CE only and are not to be opened before then.

The Crypt of Civilization has been published or broadcast by the media since its inception, including the Associated Press, ABC, NBC, CNN, NPR, the &quot;Atlanta Journal Constitution&quot;, and the &quot;New York Times newspaper&quot;. After the sealing ceremony in 1940, media organizations continued to re-visit the crypt in news stories every decade. The International Time Capsule Society, an international society club for recording the locations and contents of time capsules worldwide, was founded at Oglethorpe University on the fiftieth anniversary (1990) of the official closing of the vault. The Crypt of Civilization regained prominence from 1999 to 2001 as a result of the Millennium celebrations. The Crypt was featured in an episode of &quot;Life After People: The Series&quot; on the History Channel. The story of the Crypt was published in major newspapers all around the world.

Peters observed that the fact of such a project designed for people that will not even be born for one hundred and eighty-six generations (6,177 years) is the built-in belief that the human race will still exist and that therefore there is a need for historical preservation. He further shows that there is even a hint of reincarnation by the fact that newspaper reporter and historian Frank G. Menke asked the movie star singer Bing Crosby to be Master of Ceremonies at the opening of the crypt in 8113 CE. Crosby responded to this by saying he would be glad to do that as long as his filming schedule at the time would allow it.
