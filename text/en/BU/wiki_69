<text>Caproni, also known as &quot;Società de Agostini e Caproni&quot; and &quot;Società Caproni e Comitti&quot;, was an Italian aircraft manufacturer. Its main base of operations was at Taliedo, near Linate Airport, on the outskirts of Milan.

Founded by Giovanni Battista &quot;Gianni&quot; Caproni during 1908, the company produced several successful heavy bombers during the First World War. Following the acquisition of several other aviation firms throughout the interwar period, Caproni transformed into a sizable aviation-orientated syndicate, the &quot;Società Italiana Caproni, Milano&quot;. The majority of its aircraft were bombers and transport aircraft. It played a pioneering role in the development of the Caproni Campini N.1, an experimental aircraft powered by a thermo-jet. It provided large numbers of combat aircraft for the Axis during the Second World War. The firm did not prosper in the postwar era and the Società Italiana Caproni went out of business in 1950. Many of the company&#x27;s former assets were subsequently acquired by the Italian helicopter specialist Agusta.

==History==
The company was founded during 1908 by the Italian aviation pioneer and aeronautical engineer Giovanni Battista &quot;Gianni&quot; Caproni. It was initially named, from 1911, &quot;Società de Agostini e Caproni&quot;, then &quot;Società Caproni e Comitti&quot;. Caproni was responsible for completing the first aircraft of Italian construction in 1911. Its principal manufacturing facilities were based in Taliedo, a peripheral district of Milan, close to Linate Airport, while the firm&#x27;s Caproni Vizzola division was based in Vizzola Ticino, close to Milan–Malpensa Airport.

The firm initially produced a series of small single-engine aircraft, including the Caproni Ca.1, Ca.6 and Ca.12; these became important milestones in the early development of Italian aviation. As such, Caproni became one of the most important Allied aircraft manufacturers during the First World War, being responsible for the design and manufacture of large, multi-engine long-range bombers, such as the three-engined Caproni Ca.32, Ca.33, Ca.36 and Ca.40. These aircraft were adopted not only by the Italian military, but by the French as well. Caproni&#x27;s bombers were a significant contribution in the development of heavy aircraft. Following the end of the conflict, the strategic bombing theories of Giulio Douhet were reputedly shaped by the operational use of Caproni bombers, and thus have been was seen as an important landmark in the history of aviation.

The Interwar period was a busy one for Caproni. While the end of the First World War had led to a rapid decrease in demand for bombers, impacting orders for much of Caproni&#x27;s traditional product line, Caproni elected to redirect the bulk of the company&#x27;s resources towards the growing civil aviation market. It was also during this period that the company was reorganised into a large syndicate, which was named the &quot;Società Italiana Caproni, Milano&quot;, as a result of having acquired several smaller Italian manufacturers. By the 1930s, the company&#x27;s main subdivisions comprised Caproni Bergamasca, Caproni Vizzola, Reggiane and the engine manufacturer Isotta Fraschini. Caproni&#x27;s aircraft activity largely orientated towards the production of bombers and light transport aircraft.

Perhaps the most distinctive of Caproni&#x27;s aircraft was the Caproni Ca.60 Transaereo, an experimental large flying boat designed for the civil sector. At the time, the concept of a large multi-engined flying boat to serve long-distance passenger routes was considered to be radical. However, Caproni believed that such an aircraft could allow the travel to remote areas more quickly than ground or water transport, and that the investment required to develop and manufacturer such an aircraft would be less expensive than pursuing alternative means. During 1919, Caproni filed to patent his work on the concept. His large seaplane design, designated Caproni Ca.60, was highly unorthodox, featuring eight engines and three sets of triple wings. On 12 February or 2 March 1921, the aircraft took off for the first time, proving to be both stable and maneuverable during its brief flight, in spite of a persisting tendency to climb. However, on March 4, the sole completed aircraft was lost while attempting its second flight.

During 1927, the Caproni Museum (Italian: Museo Caproni) was established in Taliedo by Giovanni Caproni and his wife, Timina Caproni. It is both the oldest aviation museum in Italy, as well as the country&#x27;s oldest corporate museum. The Caproni Museum has long outlived the Caproni company itself.

Caproni continued to maintain its interest in innovative aircraft. One such example was the Stipa-Caproni, also known as the Caproni Stipa, which was designed by Luigi Stipa and built by Caproni during the early 1930s. The aircraft featured a hollow, barrel-shaped fuselage with the engine and propeller completely enclosed by the fuselage, effectively forming a single ducted fan. While unconventional, flight testing found that the approach induced significant aerodynamic drag, cancelling out much of the gains in engine efficiency and reducing the aircraft&#x27;s top speed to only . Some authors have claimed that its design had influenced the development of jet propulsion.
During the 1930s, Caproni became involved with the Italian aeronautics engineer Secondo Campini, who was engaged in pioneering research in the then-unexplored field of jet propulsion, having proposed adopting a so-called &quot;thermo-jet&quot; to power an aircraft. Campini had been issued with an initial contract from the Italian government to develop and manufacture his envisioned engine. During 1934, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (the Italian Air Force) granted its approval to proceed with the production of a pair of jet-powered prototype aircraft; Caproni was engaged to manufacture this aircraft, which was thus designated as the Caproni Campini N.1, with Campini providing technical guidance while specialising in the engine&#x27;s design.

On 27 August 1940, the maiden flight of the experimental N.1 occurred at Caproni&#x27;s Taliedo facility. On 30 November 1941, the second prototype was flown from Milan&#x27;s Linate Airport to Rome&#x27;s Guidonia Airport, in a highly publicised event that included a fly-past over Rome and a reception with Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. According to the historian Nathanial Edwards, the practicality of the N.1 design had been undermined by political pressure to speed the programme along so that Italy would be more likely to be the first country in the world to perform a jet-powered flight. According to economics author Harrison Mark, Soviet aircraft design bureau TsAGI obtained details on the N.1 programme and were encouraged to pursue work on a similar design; as such, there is a basis for stating that the design of the N.1 influenced subsequent early jet aircraft.

The early years of the postwar era was one of considerable hardship for Caproni and the wider Italian aviation industry alike. During 1950, the Società Italiana Caproni ceased to exist. However, one of the company&#x27;s former divisions, &quot;Caproni Vizzola&quot;, endured until 1983, at which point it was acquired by the Italian helicopter manufacturer Agusta.

<text>Albert de Broglie, 4th [[Duke of Broglie]] (; 13 June 182119 January 1901) was a French monarchist politician, diplomat and writer (of historical works and translations).

Broglie twice served as Prime Minister of France, first from May 1873 to May 1874, and again from May to November 1877.

==Biography==
Jacques Victor Albert de Broglie was born in Paris, France, the eldest son of Victor, 3rd duc de Broglie, a liberal statesman of the July Monarchy, and Albertine, baroness Staël von Holstein, the fourth child of Madame de Staël. He was therefore the great-grandson of Jacques Necker.

After a brief diplomatic career at Madrid and Rome, upon the revolution of 1848 Albert de Broglie withdrew from public life and devoted himself to literature. He had already published a translation of the religious system of Leibniz (1846). He now at once made his mark by his contributions to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot; and the Orleanist and clerical organ &quot;Le Correspondant&quot;. These, and other contributions, brought him the succession to Lacordaire&#x27;s seat in the Académie française in 1862, joining his father in this august society.

In 1870 he succeeded his father as the 4th duc de Broglie, having previously been styled prince de Broglie. In the following year he was elected to the National Assembly for the &quot;département&quot; of the Eure, and a few days later (on 19 February) was appointed French Ambassador to London. After his negotiations concerning the commercial treaties between Britain and France were met with criticism he resigned as ambassador in March 1872 and took his seat in the Assembly, where he became the leader of the royalist campaign against President Thiers.

When Thiers was replaced by Marshal Mac-Mahon, Broglie was appointed Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in May 1873. On 26 November, after the passing of the Septennate, the government was restructured and Broglie exchanged the Foreign with the Interior Ministry. His conservative policies roused the bitter hatred of the Republicans, while his attempts to reach a compromise between the rival claimants to the monarchy alienated both the Legitimists and the Bonapartists.

The result was the fall of the cabinet on 16 May 1874. Three years later (on 16 May 1877) he was entrusted with the formation of a new Cabinet, with the object of appealing to the country and securing a conservative majority in the chamber. While the conservatives increased their share of the vote, the election nevertheless confirmed a decisive Republican majority. De Broglie was defeated in his own constituency and resigned on 20 November.

Defeated again in 1885, he abandoned politics and reverted to his historical work, publishing a series of historical studies and biographies. He died in Paris on 19 January 1901, aged 79.

<text>&quot;Kevin Carter&quot; is a song by Manic Street Preachers, released as the third single from their album &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; in 1996. The song peaked at number nine on the UK Singles Chart.

==Background and composition==

The subject of the lyrics was the 1994 Pulitzer Prize-winning professional photographer Kevin Carter who was awarded for his image &quot;The Vulture and the Little Girl&quot;, taken in what is now South Sudan. Carter was troubled by the balance of his professional responsibilities with moral considerations, leading to his suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning at the age of 33.

Lead singer and guitarist James Dean Bradfield tuned his Fender Jazzmaster to open G tuning, which is commonly used in the playing of slide and bottleneck guitars. The jagged, descending chords of the verses lead into a lush extended middle section, including a trumpet solo played by Sean Moore, which further points to experimental songwriting while also linking back to the spiky music on the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;. James Dean Bradfield has said of the song, &quot;It&#x27;s quite a scratchy sound, but it&#x27;s kind of complicated in its own humble way.&quot;

Along with &quot;Elvis Impersonator: Blackpool Pier&quot;, it was one of two new tracks that he played on an acoustic guitar to the songs&#x27; lyricist, Richey Edwards, shortly before he disappeared.

==Release==
The song reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart on 12 October 1996, giving them a third straight top-ten hit, remaining in the charts for eight weeks. The song&#x27;s lyrics were written solely by missing band-member Richey Edwards. The trumpet solo has been used as the theme music to the ITV Wales current affairs programme &quot;Wales This Week&quot;.

The CD included &quot;Horses Under Starlight&quot;, &quot;Sepia&quot; and &quot;First Republic&quot;, while the cassette included an acoustic version of &quot;Everything Must Go&quot;.

The second of the three other tracks, &quot;Sepia&quot;, is a reference to the final scene of the film, &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, where the two main characters are shown in freeze frame, which then is colourised to sepia tone. The lyrics also appear to reflect some of Nicky Wire&#x27;s raw emotion following the disappearance of his close friend and bandmate.

The Butch Cassidy connection is also referenced in their song &quot;Australia&quot; (which is where the characters from the film say they will go next, directly before the &#x27;Sepia&#x27; sequence), and the decision to record &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot; for the War Child charity compilation &quot;The Help Album&quot;. This track was replaced by a single release of the track &quot;Further Away&quot; in Japan.

<text>In mathematics, Frobenius&#x27; theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for finding a maximal set of independent solutions of an overdetermined system of first-order homogeneous linear partial differential equations. In modern geometric terms, given a family of vector fields, the theorem gives necessary and sufficient integrability conditions for the existence of a foliation by maximal integral manifolds whose tangent bundles are spanned by the given vector fields. The theorem generalizes the existence theorem for ordinary differential equations, which guarantees that a single vector field always gives rise to integral curves; Frobenius gives compatibility conditions under which the integral curves of &quot;r&quot; vector fields mesh into coordinate grids on &quot;r&quot;-dimensional integral manifolds. The theorem is foundational in differential topology and calculus on manifolds.

Contact geometry studies 1-forms that maximally violates the assumptions of Frobenius&#x27; theorem. An example is shown on the right.

==Introduction==
=== One-form version ===
Suppose we are to find the trajectory of a particle in a subset of 3D space, but we do not know its trajectory formula. Instead, we know only that its trajectory satisfies formula_1, where formula_2 are smooth functions of formula_3. Thus, our only certainty is that if at some moment in time the particle is at location formula_4, then its velocity at that moment is restricted within the plane with equation formula_5

In other words, we can draw a &quot;local plane&quot; at each point in 3D space, and we know that the particle&#x27;s trajectory must be tangent to the local plane at all times.

If we have two equationsformula_6then we can draw two local planes at each point, and their intersection is generically a line, allowing us to uniquely solve for the curve starting at any point. In other words, with two 1-forms, we can foliate the domain into curves.

If we have only one equation formula_1, then we might be able to foliate formula_8 into surfaces, in which case, we can be sure that a curve starting at a certain surface must be restricted to wander within that surface. If not, then a curve starting at any point might end up at any other point in formula_8. One can imagine starting with a cloud of little planes, and quilting them together to form a full surface. The main danger is that, if we quilt the little planes two at a time, we might go on a cycle and return to where we began, but shifted by a small amount. If this happens, then we would not get a 2-dimensional surface, but a 3-dimensional blob. An example is shown in the diagram on the right.

If the one-form is integrable, then loops exactly close upon themselves, and each surface would be 2-dimensional. Frobenius&#x27; theorem states that this happens precisely when formula_10 over all of the domain, where formula_11. The notation is defined in the article on one-forms.

During his development of axiomatic thermodynamics, Carathéodory proved that if formula_12 is an integrable one-form on an open subset of formula_13, then formula_14 for some scalar functions formula_15 on the subset. This is usually called Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem in axiomatic thermodynamics. One can prove this intuitively by first constructing the little planes according to formula_12, quilting them together into a foliation, then assigning each surface in the foliation with a scalar label. Now for each point formula_17, define formula_18 to be the scalar label of the surface containing point formula_17. 

Now, formula_20 is a one-form that has exactly the same planes as formula_12. However, it has &quot;even thickness&quot; everywhere, while formula_12 might have &quot;uneven thickness&quot;. This can be fixed by a scalar scaling by formula_23, giving formula_14. This is illustrated on the right.

=== Multiple one-forms ===
In its most elementary form, the theorem addresses the problem of finding a maximal set of independent solutions of a regular system of first-order linear homogeneous partial differential equations. Let

:formula_25

be a collection of functions, with , and such that the matrix has rank &quot;r&quot; when evaluated at any point of . Consider the following system of partial differential equations for a function :

:formula_26

One seeks conditions on the existence of a collection of solutions such that the gradients are linearly independent.

The Frobenius theorem asserts that this problem admits a solution locally if, and only if, the operators satisfy a certain integrability condition known as &quot;involutivity&quot;. Specifically, they must satisfy relations of the form

:formula_27

for , and all functions &quot;u&quot;, and for some coefficients &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;ij&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) that are allowed to depend on &quot;x&quot;. In other words, the commutators must lie in the linear span of the at every point. The involutivity condition is a generalization of the commutativity of partial derivatives. In fact, the strategy of proof of the Frobenius theorem is to form linear combinations among the operators so that the resulting operators do commute, and then to show that there is a coordinate system for which these are precisely the partial derivatives with respect to .

=== From analysis to geometry ===
Even though the system is overdetermined there are typically infinitely many solutions. For example, the system of differential equations

:formula_28

clearly permits multiple solutions. Nevertheless, these solutions still have enough structure that they may be completely described. The first observation is that, even if &quot;f&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2 are two different solutions, the level surfaces of &quot;f&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2 must overlap. In fact, the level surfaces for this system are all planes in of the form , for a constant. The second observation is that, once the level surfaces are known, all solutions can then be given in terms of an arbitrary function. Since the value of a solution &quot;f&quot; on a level surface is constant by definition, define a function &quot;C&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) by:

:formula_29

Conversely, if a function is given, then each function &quot;f&quot; given by this expression is a solution of the original equation. Thus, because of the existence of a family of level surfaces, solutions of the original equation are in a one-to-one correspondence with arbitrary functions of one variable.

Frobenius&#x27; theorem allows one to establish a similar such correspondence for the more general case of solutions of (1). Suppose that are solutions of the problem (1) satisfying the independence condition on the gradients. Consider the level sets of as functions with values in . If is another such collection of solutions, one can show (using some linear algebra and the mean value theorem) that this has the same family of level sets but with a possibly different choice of constants for each set. Thus, even though the independent solutions of (1) are not unique, the equation (1) nonetheless determines a unique family of level sets. Just as in the case of the example, general solutions &quot;u&quot; of (1) are in a one-to-one correspondence with (continuously differentiable) functions on the family of level sets.

The level sets corresponding to the maximal independent solution sets of (1) are called the &quot;integral manifolds&quot; because functions on the collection of all integral manifolds correspond in some sense to constants of integration. Once one of these constants of integration is known, then the corresponding solution is also known.
==Frobenius&#x27; theorem in modern language==
The Frobenius theorem can be restated more economically in modern language. Frobenius&#x27; original version of the theorem was stated in terms of Pfaffian systems, which today can be translated into the language of differential forms. An alternative formulation, which is somewhat more intuitive, uses vector fields.

===Formulation using vector fields===
In the vector field formulation, the theorem states that a subbundle of the tangent bundle of a manifold is integrable (or involutive) if and only if it arises from a regular foliation. In this context, the Frobenius theorem relates integrability to foliation; to state the theorem, both concepts must be clearly defined.

One begins by noting that an arbitrary smooth vector field formula_30 on a manifold formula_31 defines a family of curves, its integral curves formula_32 (for intervals formula_33). These are the solutions of formula_34, which is a system of first-order ordinary differential equations, whose solvability is guaranteed by the Picard–Lindelöf theorem. If the vector field formula_30 is nowhere zero then it defines a one-dimensional subbundle of the tangent bundle of formula_31, and the integral curves form a regular foliation of formula_31. Thus, one-dimensional subbundles are always integrable.

If the subbundle has dimension greater than one, a condition needs to be imposed.
One says that a subbundle formula_38 of the tangent bundle formula_39 is integrable (or involutive), if, for any two vector fields formula_30 and formula_41 taking values in formula_42, the Lie bracket formula_43 takes values in formula_42 as well. This notion of integrability need only be defined locally; that is, the existence of the vector fields formula_30 and formula_41 and their integrability need only be defined on subsets of formula_31.

Several definitions of foliation exist. Here we use the following:

Definition. A &quot;p&quot;-dimensional, class &quot;Cr&quot; foliation of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; is a decomposition of &quot;M&quot; into a union of disjoint connected submanifolds {&quot;L&quot;α}α∈&quot;A&quot;, called the &quot;leaves&quot; of the foliation, with the following property: Every point in &quot;M&quot; has a neighborhood &quot;U&quot; and a system of local, class &quot;Cr&quot; coordinates &quot;x&quot;=(&quot;x&quot;1, ⋅⋅⋅, &quot;xn&quot;) : &quot;U&quot;→R&quot;n&quot; such that for each leaf &quot;L&quot;α, the components of &quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;L&quot;α are described by the equations &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot;+1=constant, ⋅⋅⋅, &quot;xn&quot;=constant. A foliation is denoted by formula_48={&quot;L&quot;α}α∈&quot;A&quot;.

Trivially, any foliation of formula_31 defines an integrable subbundle, since if formula_50 and formula_51 is the leaf of the foliation passing through formula_17 then formula_53 is integrable. Frobenius&#x27; theorem states that the converse is also true:

Given the above definitions, Frobenius&#x27; theorem states that a subbundle formula_42 is integrable if and only if the subbundle formula_42 arises from a regular foliation of formula_31.

===Differential forms formulation===
Let &quot;U&quot; be an open set in a manifold , be the space of smooth, differentiable 1-forms on &quot;U&quot;, and &quot;F&quot; be a submodule of of rank &quot;r&quot;, the rank being constant in value over &quot;U&quot;. The Frobenius theorem states that &quot;F&quot; is integrable if and only if for every in the stalk &quot;Fp&quot; is generated by &quot;r&quot; exact differential forms.

Geometrically, the theorem states that an integrable module of -forms of rank &quot;r&quot; is the same thing as a codimension-r foliation. The correspondence to the definition in terms of vector fields given in the introduction follows from the close relationship between differential forms and Lie derivatives. Frobenius&#x27; theorem is one of the basic tools for the study of vector fields and foliations.

There are thus two forms of the theorem: one which operates with distributions, that is smooth subbundles &quot;D&quot; of the tangent bundle &quot;TM&quot;; and the other which operates with subbundles of the graded ring of all forms on &quot;M&quot;. These two forms are related by duality. If &quot;D&quot; is a smooth tangent distribution on , then the annihilator of &quot;D&quot;, &quot;I&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) consists of all forms formula_57 (for any formula_58) such that

:formula_59

for all formula_60. The set &quot;I&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) forms a subring and, in fact, an ideal in . Furthermore, using the definition of the exterior derivative, it can be shown that &quot;I&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) is closed under exterior differentiation (it is a differential ideal) if and only if &quot;D&quot; is involutive. Consequently, the Frobenius theorem takes on the equivalent form that is closed under exterior differentiation if and only if &quot;D&quot; is integrable.

==Generalizations==
The theorem may be generalized in a variety of ways.

===Infinite dimensions===
One infinite-dimensional generalization is as follows. Let and be Banach spaces, and a pair of open sets. Let

:formula_61

be a continuously differentiable function of the Cartesian product (which inherits a differentiable structure from its inclusion into &quot;X&quot; ×&quot;Y&quot; ) into the space of continuous linear transformations of into &quot;Y&quot;. A differentiable mapping &quot;u&quot; : &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; is a solution of the differential equation

:formula_62

if

:formula_63

The equation (1) is completely integrable if for each formula_64, there is a neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot;0 such that (1) has a unique solution defined on &quot;U&quot; such that &quot;u&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0)=&quot;y&quot;0.

The conditions of the Frobenius theorem depend on whether the underlying field is or . If it is R, then assume &quot;F&quot; is continuously differentiable. If it is , then assume &quot;F&quot; is twice continuously differentiable. Then (1) is completely integrable at each point of if and only if

:formula_65

for all . Here (resp. ) denotes the partial derivative with respect to the first (resp. second) variable; the dot product denotes the action of the linear operator , as well as the actions of the operators and .

==== Banach manifolds ====
The infinite-dimensional version of the Frobenius theorem also holds on Banach manifolds. The statement is essentially the same as the finite-dimensional version.

Let be a Banach manifold of class at least &quot;C&quot;2. Let be a subbundle of the tangent bundle of . The bundle is involutive if, for each point and pair of sections and &quot;Y&quot; of defined in a neighborhood of &quot;p&quot;, the Lie bracket of and &quot;Y&quot; evaluated at &quot;p&quot;, lies in :

:formula_66

On the other hand, is integrable if, for each , there is an immersed submanifold whose image contains &quot;p&quot;, such that the differential of is an isomorphism of &quot;TN&quot; with .

The Frobenius theorem states that a subbundle is integrable if and only if it is involutive.

===Holomorphic forms===
The statement of the theorem remains true for holomorphic 1-forms on complex manifolds — manifolds over with biholomorphic transition functions.

Specifically, if formula_67 are &quot;r&quot; linearly independent holomorphic 1-forms on an open set in such that

:formula_68

for some system of holomorphic 1-forms , then there exist holomorphic functions &quot;f&quot;ij and such that, on a possibly smaller domain,

:formula_69

This result holds locally in the same sense as the other versions of the Frobenius theorem. In particular, the fact that it has been stated for domains in is not restrictive.

===Higher degree forms===
The statement does not generalize to higher degree forms, although there is a number of partial results such as Darboux&#x27;s theorem and the Cartan-Kähler theorem.

==History==
Despite being named for Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, the theorem was first proven by Alfred Clebsch and Feodor Deahna. Deahna was the first to establish the sufficient conditions for the theorem, and Clebsch developed the necessary conditions. Frobenius is responsible for applying the theorem to Pfaffian systems, thus paving the way for its usage in differential topology.

==Applications==
* In classical mechanics, the integrability of a system&#x27;s constraint equations determines whether the system is holonomic or nonholonomic.
* In microeconomic theory, Frobenius&#x27; theorem can be used to prove the existence of a solution to the problem of integrability of demand functions.

=== Carathéodory&#x27;s axiomatic thermodynamics ===
In classical thermodynamics, Frobenius&#x27; theorem can be used to construct entropy and temperature in Carathéodory&#x27;s formalism.

Specifically, Carathéodory considered a thermodynamic system (concretely one can imagine a piston of gas) that can interact with the outside world by either heat conduction (such as setting the piston on fire) or mechanical work (pushing on the piston). He then defined &quot;adiabatic process&quot; as any process that the system may undergo without heat conduction, and defined a relation of &quot;adiabatic accessibility&quot; thus: if the system can go from state A to state B after an adiabatic process, then formula_70 is adiabatically accessible from formula_71. Write it as formula_72.

Now assume that

* For any pair of states formula_73, at least one of formula_72 and formula_75 holds.
* For any state formula_71, and any neighborhood of formula_71, there exists a state formula_70 in the neighborhood, such that formula_70 is adiabatically inaccessible from formula_71.

Then, we can foliate the state space into subsets of states that are mutually adiabatically accessible. With mild assumptions on the smoothness of formula_81, each subset is a manifold of codimension 1. Call these manifolds &quot;adiabatic surfaces&quot;.

By the first law of thermodynamics, there exists a scalar function formula_82 (&quot;internal energy&quot;) on the state space, such thatformula_83where formula_84 are the possible ways to perform mechanical work on the system. For example, if the system is a tank of ideal gas, then formula_85.

Now, define the one-form on the state spaceformula_86Now, since the adiabatic surfaces are tangent to formula_12 at every point in state space, formula_12 is integrable, so by Carathéodory&#x27;s theorem, there exists two scalar functions formula_89 on state space, such that formula_90. These are the temperature and entropy functions, up to a multiplicative constant. 

By plugging in the ideal gas laws, and noting that Joule expansion is an (irreversible) adiabatic process, we can fix the sign of formula_91, and find that formula_72 means formula_93. That is, entropy is preserved in reversible adiabatic processes, and increases during irreversible adiabatic processes.

<text>Abraham Kuenen (16 September 1828 – 10 December 1891) was a Dutch Protestant theologian.

Kuenen was born in Haarlem, the son of an apothecary. On his father&#x27;s death it became necessary for him to leave school and take a humble place in the business. By the generosity of friends he was educated at the gymnasium at Haarlem and afterwards at the University of Leiden. He studied theology, and won his doctor&#x27;s degree by an edition of thirty-four chapters of Genesis from the Arabic version of the Samaritan Pentateuch. In 1853 he became professor extraordinarius of theology at Leiden, and in 1855 full professor. He married a daughter of Willem Muurling, one of the founders of the Groningen school, which made the first pronounced breach with Calvinistic theology in the Reformed Church of the Netherlands.

Kuenen himself soon became one of the main supporters of the modern theology, of which Jan Hendrik Scholten and Karel Willem Opzoomer (b. 1821) were the chief founders, and of which Leiden became the headquarters. His first great work, an historico-critical introduction to the Old Testament, &quot;Historisch-Kritisch Onderzoek naar het onstaan en de verzameling van de Boeken des Ouden Verbonds&quot; (3 vols., 1861-1865; 2nd ed., 1885-1893; German by T Weber and CT Müller, 1885-1894), followed the lines of this dominant school of Heinrich Ewald.

But before long he came under the influence of J.W. Colenso, and learned to regard the prophetic narrative of Genesis, Exodus, and Numbers as older than what was by the Germans denominated &quot;Grundschrift&quot; (&quot;Book of Origins&quot;). In 1869-1870 he published his book on the religion of Israel, &quot;De Godsdienst van Israël tot den ondergang van den Joodschen staat&quot; (3 vols.; Eng. trans., 1874-1875).

This was followed in 1875 by a study of Hebrew prophecy, &quot;De profeten en de profetie onder Israel&quot; (Eng. trans., 1877), largely polemical in its scope, and specially directed against those who rest theological dogmas on the fulfilment of prophecy. In 1882 Kuenen went to England to deliver a course of Hibbert lectures, &quot;National Religions and Universal Religion&quot;; in the following year he presided at the congress of Orientalists held at Leiden. In 1886 his volume on the Hexateuch was published in England. He was also a member of the Teylers First Society (1856–1891). He died at Leiden on December 10, 1891.

Kuenen was also the author of many articles, papers and reviews; a series on the Hexateuch, which appeared in the &quot;Theologisch Tijdschrift&quot;, of which in 1866 he became joint editor, is one of the finest products of modern criticism. His collected works were translated into German and published by Karl Budde in 1894. Several of his works have been translated into English by Philip Wicksteed. See the article in Herzog-Hauck, &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;.

<text>Jan Hendrik Scholten (born Johannes Heinrich Scholten, 17 August 1811, Vleuten – 10 April 1885, Leiden), Dutch Protestant theologian, was born at Vleuten near Utrecht.

==Biography==
After studying at Utrecht University, he was appointed professor of theology in 1840 at Franeker. From Franeker in 1843 he went to Leiden as professor &quot;extraordinarius&quot;, and in 1845 was promoted to the rank of &quot;ordinarius&quot;. Through Scholten, Abraham Kuenen became interested in theology; Scholten was not then the radical theologian he became later. The two scholars in course of time created a movement resembling that of the Tübingen School in Germany. From his theology there &quot;began to rise a different type of spirit, the spirit of absolute antisupernaturalism of the German idealistic kind.&quot;

Pursuing first the study of dogmatic theology and the philosophy of religion, Scholten published a work on the &quot;Principles of the Theology of the Reformed Church&quot; (2 vols, 1848–1850, 4th ed. 1861–1862). He then gave special attention to the New Testament, and wrote &quot;A Critical Study of the Gospel of John&quot; (1864, in German 1867).

Scholten&#x27;s other works include:
*&quot;Historical and Critical Introduction to the New Testament&quot; (1853–1856)
*&quot;The Oldest Witnesses to the Writings of the New Testament&quot; (1866)
*&quot;The Oldest Gospel&quot; (1868)
*&quot;The Pauline Gospel&quot; (1870)
*A Comparative View of Religions

An account of his theological development is given in &quot;Afscheidsrede bij het Neerleggen van het Hoogleeraarsambt&quot; (1881), and in the biography written by A Kuenen, &quot;Levensbericht van J. Henricus Scholten&quot; (1885).

He became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1856.

<text>In mathematics, a sober space is a topological space &quot;X&quot; such that every (nonempty) irreducible closed subset of &quot;X&quot; is the closure of exactly one point of &quot;X&quot;: that is, every nonempty irreducible closed subset has a unique generic point.

==Definitions==
Sober spaces have a variety of cryptomorphic definitions, which are documented in this section. In each case below, replacing &quot;unique&quot; with &quot;at most one&quot; gives an equivalent formulation of the T0 axiom. Replacing it with &quot;at least one&quot; is equivalent to the property that the T0 quotient of the space is sober, which is sometimes referred to as having &quot;enough points&quot; in the literature.

=== With irreducible closed sets ===
A closed set is irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two proper closed subsets. A space is sober if every nonempty irreducible closed subset is the closure of a unique point. 

=== In terms of morphisms of frames and locales ===
A topological space &quot;X&quot; is sober if every map that preserves all joins and all finite meets from its partially ordered set of open subsets to formula_1 is the inverse image of a unique continuous function from the one-point space to &quot;X&quot;.

This may be viewed as a correspondence between the notion of a point in a locale and a point in a topological space, which is the motivating definition.

=== Using completely prime filters ===
A filter &quot;F&quot; of open sets is said to be &quot;completely prime&quot; if for any family formula_2 of open sets such that formula_3, we have that formula_4 for some &quot;i&quot;. A space X is sober if each completely prime filter is the neighbourhood filter of a unique point in X.

=== In terms of nets ===
A net formula_5 is &quot;self-convergent&quot; if it converges to every point formula_6 in formula_5, or equivalently if its eventuality filter is completely prime. A net formula_5 that converges to formula_9 &quot;converges strongly&quot; if it can only converge to points in the closure of formula_9. A space is sober if every self-convergent net formula_5 converges strongly to a unique point formula_9.

In particular, a space is T1 and sober precisely if every self-convergent net is constant.

=== As a property of sheaves on the space ===
A space &quot;X&quot; is sober if every functor from the category of sheaves &quot;Sh(X)&quot; to &quot;Set&quot; that preserves all finite limits and all small colimits must be the stalk functor of a unique point &quot;x&quot;.

==Properties and examples==
Any Hausdorff (T2) space is sober (the only irreducible subsets being points), and all sober spaces are Kolmogorov (T0), and both implications are strict.

Sobriety is not comparable to the T1 condition:
* an example of a T1 space which is not sober is an infinite set with the cofinite topology, the whole space being an irreducible closed subset with no generic point;
* an example of a sober space which is not T1 is the Sierpinski space.

Moreover T2 is stronger than T1 &quot;and&quot; sober, i.e., while every T2 space is at once T1 and sober, there exist spaces that are simultaneously T1 and sober, but not T2. One such example is the following: let X be the set of real numbers, with a new point p adjoined; the open sets being all real open sets, and all cofinite sets containing p.

Sobriety of &quot;X&quot; is precisely a condition that forces the lattice of open subsets of &quot;X&quot; to determine &quot;X&quot; up to homeomorphism, which is relevant to pointless topology.

Sobriety makes the specialization preorder a directed complete partial order.

Every continuous directed complete poset equipped with the Scott topology is sober.

Finite T0 spaces are sober.

The prime spectrum Spec(&quot;R&quot;) of a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; with the Zariski topology is a compact sober space. In fact, every spectral space (i.e. a compact sober space for which the collection of compact open subsets is closed under finite intersections and forms a base for the topology) is homeomorphic to Spec(&quot;R&quot;) for some commutative ring &quot;R&quot;. This is a theorem of Melvin Hochster.
More generally, the underlying topological space of any scheme is a sober space.

The subset of Spec(&quot;R&quot;) consisting only of the maximal ideals, where &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring, is not sober in general.

<doc id="602501" wikidata="Q186445" url="?curid=602501" title="Who's Harry Crumb?">
<text>Who&#x27;s Harry Crumb? is a 1989 American comedy-mystery film featuring John Candy as the title character. Paul Flaherty directed the film, which co-stars Annie Potts, Jeffrey Jones and Shawnee Smith. An uncredited cameo appearance is made by Jim Belushi. The story concerns the often incompetent, sometimes brilliant, private investigator Harry Crumb, who searches for a kidnapping victim.

==Plot==
In Beverly Hills, fashion model Jennifer Downing is kidnapped. Her father, multimillionaire P.J. Downing, turns to family friend Eliot Draisen—president of the Crumb &amp; Crumb private detective agency—to investigate the case, unaware he is the kidnapper. Eliot offers them the aid of Harry Crumb, the last descendant of the agency&#x27;s distinguished founders. A bumbling, clumsy, but dedicated detective with a penchant for disguises, Harry is recalled from the Tulsa, Oklahoma branch where he was assigned ten years earlier to keep him away from the head office. Eliot believes Harry will be completely ineffective in solving the case.

Harry meets with the Downing family, including Jennifer&#x27;s overlooked younger sister Nikki and P.J.&#x27;s greedy new wife Helen, who is having an affair with her tennis coach Vince Barnes. Harry becomes suspicious of Helen after learning Jennifer was kidnapped while using Helen&#x27;s salon appointment. P.J. receives a $10million ransom demand to spare Jennifer&#x27;s life. Meanwhile, Eliot meets with Helen, confessing he has been in love with her since they went to school together. Helen rebuffs him, admitting she only cares about money and would only be with Eliot if he possessed vast wealth.

Convinced that Helen and Vince are the kidnappers, Harry begins working with Nikki to investigate them. Concerned that P.J. will pay the ransom, Helen and Vince decide to implement their own long-planned effort to kill P.J. so she will inherit his money first. They sabotage the brakes on P.J.&#x27;s car but Harry and Nikki borrow it to covertly follow Helen and Vince. When the brakes fail, Harry unintentionally rams their car and they assume that he is chasing them. The pair escape after Harry crashes his car. Harry assumes they sabotaged the car to kill him and stop his investigation.

Harry infiltrates the vent system in Vince&#x27;s apartment complex to spy on him and Helen, unaware that Vince has been lured away by Eliot who uses his knowledge of her affair to blackmail her for sex. Unable to see through the high vent in the apartment, Harry overhears film characters on the TV discussing traveling to Buenos Aires which he believes is Vince and Helen planning to flee the country; the location also inspires Eliot&#x27;s own escape plans. Eliot sends a new ransom demanding the money by Friday, which Helen intercepts and changes to the following Monday, giving herself more time to kill P.J.. Eliot has his accomplice Dwayne force Jennifer to call and re-confirm the ransom for Friday, to be exchanged at the horse racing track. Eliot takes the briefcase containing the cash from Harry, ostensibly under instructions from the kidnapper, and leaves for the airport. Helen and Vince unsuccessfully try to follow him to steal the money.

At the airport, Eliot calls Helen, admits his role in the kidnapping, and asks her to come with him to Buenos Aires now that he is rich, to which she readily agrees. Vince overhears the call and intercepts the pair, taking the money and causing Helen to rejoin him. They bind and gag Eliot, leaving him in a utility room, before boarding the plane. Harry and Nikki arrive, commandeering a stair truck to pursue the plane. Their chaotic chase causes a luggage trolley to crash into the building in which Dwayne is holding Jennifer, inadvertently electrocuting Dwayne to death. Nikki rams the stair car into the plane, allowing Harry to capture Helen and Vince, who are taken into police custody. With Jennifer saved, Harry and Nikki celebrate until he overhears Eliot trying to free himself. Assuming Harry has deduced his part in the kidnapping and exasperated at his success, Eliot confesses and is arrested.

Harry is named the new president of Crumb &amp; Crumb, and P.J. thanks him for reconciling the relationship between himself and Nikki. A new case is brought to Harry&#x27;s attention—a murder at the Bottom&#x27;s Up club in San Francisco.

==Release==
===Box office===

&quot;Who&#x27;s Harry Crumb?&quot; was released in the United States and Canada on February 3, 1989. During its opening weekend it grossed a total of $3.9million from 1,197 theaters—an average of $3,227 per theater—making it the fifth-highest grossing film of the weekend, behind &quot;Beaches&quot; ($4.2million) in its seventh week of release, and ahead of &quot;Twins&quot; ($3.3million) in its ninth. In its second weekend, &quot;Who&#x27;s Harry Crumb?&quot; fell to the number 8 position with a $2.3million gross—a 40.1% drop from the previous week—placing it behind &quot;Twins&quot; ($2.9million) and ahead of the debuting &quot;Tap&quot; ($2.2million). In total, &quot;Who&#x27;s Harry Crumb?&quot; grossed $11million, making it only the 84th-highest-grossing film of 1989.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on July 6, 1989, and failed to reach the Top 15.

===Critical reception===
Janet Maslin praised several of the performances in the film, including Candy&#x27;s, but dismissed the film as a &quot;weak comedy&quot;. Noting that &quot;Who&#x27;s Harry Crumb?&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot; center on detectives who both feign wisdom while being oblivious, not to mention the same fish sight gag, Maslin concludes that Leslie Nielsen comes out the better in the comparison.
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on 11 reviews. On Metacritic it has a score of and 44% based on reviews from 10 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;C&quot; on scale of A to F.

According to motion picture-historian Leonard Maltin, &quot;Candy is ideally cast, but the film itself is uneven...With some very funny moments, but too much outright silliness.&quot;

In March 2018, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; included the film as one of &quot;The Underrated Movies of 1989&quot;, commenting that it &quot;isn&#x27;t necessarily vintage Candy...it&#x27;s still a lot of fun, and gives him a title role that he clearly enjoyed.&quot;

<text>Heinrich Philipp Konrad Henke (3 July 1752 – 2 May 1809), German theologian, best known as a writer on church history, was born at Hehlen, Brunswick-Lüneburg. He was the father of historian Ernst Ludwig Theodor Henke (1804–1872).

He received his education at the gymnasium in Braunschweig and at the University of Helmstedt. Until 1809, he was associated with the University of Helmstedt, named as an associate professor of philosophy in 1777 and of theology the following year. In 1780, he was chosen as a full professor of theology. During his tenure at Helmstedt, he was appointed abbot of Michaelstein Abbey (1786) and vice-president of the Carolinum in Braunschweig (1803).

Henke was a proponent of theological rationalism. His principal work, the multi-volume &quot;Allgemeine Geschichte der christlichen Kirche nach der Zeitfolge&quot; (General history of the Christian Church in chronological order) was praised by Ferdinand Christian Baur &quot;as one of the most exquisite works of literature&quot;. Other noteworthy efforts by Henke include:
* &quot;Lineamenta institutionum fidei Christianae historico-criticarum&quot; (1793).
* &quot;Opuscula academica, theologici potissimum argumenti&quot; (1802).

Also, he was an editor of the &quot;Magazin für die Religionsphilosophie, Exegese und Kirchengeschichte&quot; (1793–1804) and the &quot;Archiv für die neueste Kirchengeschichte&quot; (1794–1799).

<text>&quot;Everything Must Go&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers, released as the second single from their fourth studio album, &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; (1996), on 22 July 1996. The song reached number five on the UK Singles Chart.

==Background==
The song is cited by Wire as a message to the fans, saying the music had changed after the loss of Richey Edwards, but the band is still the same. Ushering in a new era for the band, Wire&#x27;s lyric asks fans to forgive them for changing: &quot;and I just hope that you can forgive us, but everything must go&quot;.

James Dean Bradfield has said Sean Moore had a lot of freedom in the drums for his song. By contrast to several previous Manic Street Preachers singles, the drums are not &quot;compressed&quot;, but are more open and free, giving a sense of disorder in the song. The song features a prominent string section that commentators such as &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s Tom Doyle have compared to the songs of Phil Spector and his Wall of Sound.

==Release==
&quot;Everything Must Go&quot; reached number five on the UK Singles Chart on 3 August 1996, making it the second of five consecutive UK top-ten singles. In Finland the song reached number 18. The CD release included &quot;Black Garden&quot;, &quot;Hanging On&quot; and &quot;No One Knows What It&#x27;s Like to Be Me&quot; whereas the cassette featured a live version of &quot;Raindrops Keep Fallin&#x27; on My Head&quot;. An acoustic version of the song appears on the cassette single of &quot;Kevin Carter&quot;. The Chemical Brothers&#x27; remix of the song appeared in the intro movie to the American and European versions of the PlayStation game &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;. The song also made an appearance on &quot;Forever Delayed&quot;, the band&#x27;s greatest-hits album released in November 2002.

<text>The state of North Carolina has 42 official state emblems, as well as other designated places and events. The majority is determined by acts of the North Carolina General Assembly and record in Chapters 144, 145, and 149 of the North Carolina General Statutes. The state&#x27;s nicknames – &quot;The Old North State&quot; and &quot;The Tar Heel State&quot; – are both traditional, but have never been passed into law by the General Assembly.

The first symbol was the Seal of North Carolina, which was made official in 1871. The original seal also contained the future state motto. It served as the state&#x27;s only emblem for 14 years until the adoption of the state flag in 1885. Enacted by law in 2013, the newest symbols of North Carolina are the state art medium, clay; the state fossil, the megalodon teeth; the state frog, the Pine Barrens tree frog; the state marsupial, the Virginia opossum; and the state salamander, the marbled salamander.

<text>In Greek mythology, Nestor of Gerenia (, &quot;Nestōr Gerēnios&quot;) was a legendary king of Pylos. He is a prominent secondary character in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, where he appears as an elderly warrior who frequently offers advice to the other characters.

The Mycenaean-era palace at Pylos is known as the &quot;Palace of Nestor&quot;, though there is no evidence that he was an actual person.

== Description ==
In the account of Dares the Phrygian, Nestor was illustrated as &quot;... large, broad and fair. His nose was long and hooked. He was a wise adviser.&quot;

== Family ==
Nestor was the son of King Neleus of Pylos and Chloris, daughter of King Amphion of Orchomenus. Otherwise, Nestor&#x27;s mother was called Polymede.

His wife was either Eurydice or Anaxibia; their children included Peisistratus, Thrasymedes, Pisidice, Polycaste, Perseus, Stratichus, Aretus, Echephron, and Antilochus. In late accounts, Nestor had a daughter Epicaste who became the mother of Homer by Telemachus.

==Mythology==

=== Adventures ===
Originally from Gerenia, Nestor was an Argonaut, helped to fight the centaurs, and also participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. He became the King of Pylos after Heracles killed Neleus and all of Nestor&#x27;s brothers. He was said to have lived three generations by favour of Apollo: the years that the god had taken from Chloris and her brothers, he granted to Nestor.

He and his sons, Antilochus and Thrasymedes, fought on the side of the Achaeans in the Trojan War. Though Nestor was already very old when the war began, he was noted for his bravery and speaking abilities. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, he often gives advice to the younger warriors and advises Agamemnon and Achilles to reconcile. He is too old to engage in combat himself, but he leads the Pylian troops, riding his chariot; one of his horses is killed by an arrow shot by Paris. He also had a solid gold shield. Homer frequently calls him by the epithet &quot;the Gerenian horseman.&quot; At the funeral games of Patroclus, Nestor advises Antilochus on how to win the chariot race. Antilochus was later killed in battle by Memnon.

In the &quot;Odyssey,&quot; Nestor and those who were part of his army had safely returned to Pylos, having chosen to leave Troy immediately after plundering the city rather than staying behind with Agamemnon to appease Athena, who was angered by the heinous actions of some of the Greeks (probably Ajax the Lesser). Odysseus&#x27;s son Telemachus travels to Pylos to inquire about the fate of his father. Nestor receives his friend&#x27;s son, Telemachus, kindly and entertains him lavishly but is unable to furnish any information on his father&#x27;s fate. Also appearing in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; are Nestor&#x27;s wife Eurydice and their remaining living sons: Echephron, Stratius, Aretus, Thrasymedes and Peisistratus. Nestor also had two daughters named Pisidice and Polycaste.

===Advice===
Nestor&#x27;s advice in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, while always respected by his listeners due to his age and experience, is always tempered with a subtext of humor at his expense due to his boastfulness, as he is never able to dispense the advice without first spending several paragraphs recounting his own heroic actions in the past when faced with similar circumstances.

In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, too, Homer&#x27;s admiration of Nestor is tempered by some humor at his expense: Telemachus, having returned to Nestor&#x27;s home from a visit to Helen of Troy and Menelaus (where he has sought further information on his father&#x27;s fate), urges Peisistratus to let him board his vessel immediately to return home rather than being subjected to a further dose of Nestor&#x27;s rather overwhelming sense of hospitality. Peisistratus readily agrees, although ruefully stating that his father is bound to be furious when he learns of Telemachus&#x27;s departure.

Nestor&#x27;s advice in the &quot;Iliad&quot; has also been interpreted to have sinister undertones. For example, when Patroclus comes to Nestor for advice in Book 11, Nestor persuades him that it is urgent for him to disguise himself as Achilles. Karl Reinhardt argues that this is contrary to what Patroclus really originally wanted—in fact, he is only there to receive information on behalf of Achilles about the wounded Machaon. Reinhardt notes that an &quot;unimportant errand left behind by an all-important one ... Patroclus&#x27; role as messenger is crucial and an ironic purpose permeates the encounter.&quot;

Homer offers contradictory portrayals of Nestor as a source of advice. On one hand, Homer describes him as a wise man; Nestor repeatedly offers advice to the Achaeans that has been claimed to be anachronistic in Homer&#x27;s time—for example, arranging the armies by tribes and clans or effectively using chariots in battle. Yet at the same time Nestor&#x27;s advice is frequently ineffective. Some examples include Nestor accepting without question the dream Zeus plants in Agamemnon in Book 2 and urging the Achaeans to battle, instructing the Achaeans in Book 4 to use spear techniques that in actuality would be disastrous, and in Book 11 giving advice to Patroclus that ultimately leads to his death. Yet Nestor is never questioned and instead is frequently praised.

Hanna Roisman explains that the characters in the &quot;Iliad&quot; ignore the discrepancy between the quality of Nestor&#x27;s advice and its outcomes because, in the world of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, &quot;outcomes are ultimately in the hands of the ever arbitrary and fickle gods ... heroes are not necessarily viewed as responsible when things go awry&quot;. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, people are judged not necessarily in the modern view of results, but as people. Therefore, Nestor should be viewed as a good counselor because of the qualities he possesses as described in his introduction in Book 1—as a man of &quot;sweet words&quot;, a &quot;clear-voiced orator&quot;, and whose voice &quot;flows sweeter than honey&quot;. These are elements that make up Nestor, and they parallel the elements that Homer describes as part of a good counselor at &quot;Iliad&quot; 3.150–152. Therefore, &quot;the definition tells us that Nestor, as a good advisor, possesses the three features ... that it designates&quot;. Nestor is a good counselor inherently, and the consequences of his advice have no bearing on that, a view that differs from how good counselors are viewed today.

<text>Ernst Ludwig Theodor Henke (22 February 1804 in Helmstedt – 1 December 1872 in Marburg), was a German theologian and historian, and the son of the theologian Heinrich Henke (1752–1809). He was the father of anatomist Wilhelm von Henke (1834–1896).

From 1820, he studied at the Collegium Carolinum in Braunschweig, then continued his education at the Universities of Göttingen and Jena, where he was influenced by his later father-in-law Jakob Friedrich Fries (1773–1843) and Ludwig Baumgarten-Crusius (1788–1843). In 1826 he received his doctorate of philosophy, later returning to Braunschweig, where he taught classes at the Collegium Carolinum. In 1833 he was appointed an associate professor of church history and exegesis at Jena, followed by a full professorship at the University of Marburg (1839).

<doc id="602513" wikidata="Q338386" url="?curid=602513" title="Victor de Broglie (1785–1870)">
<text>Victor de Broglie, 3rd [[Duke of Broglie]] (; 28 November 178525 January 1870), briefly Victor de Broglie, was a French peer, statesman, and diplomat. He was the third duke of Broglie and served as president of the Council during the July Monarchy, from August 1830 to November 1830 and from March 1835 to February 1836. Victor de Broglie was close to the liberal &quot;Doctrinaires&quot; who opposed the ultra-royalists and were absorbed, under Louis-Philippe&#x27;s rule, by the Orléanists.
==Biography==

===Early life===
Victor de Broglie was born in Paris on 28 November 1785, the youngest child and only son of Charles-Louis-Victor, prince de Broglie, and grandson of Victor-François, 2nd duc de Broglie. While his grandfather emigrated, his parents were imprisoned during the Terror. His father was guillotined in 1794, but his mother, the former Countess Sophie de Rosen (Paris 10 Mar 1764Paris 31 Oct 1828) managed to escape to Switzerland, where she remained until the fall of Robespierre. She then returned to Paris with her children – three older daughters and one son– and lived there quietly until 1796, when she married the Marc-René-Voyer de Paulmy, marquis d&#x27;Argenson, grandson of Louis XV&#x27;s minister of war. On his grandfather&#x27;s death in 1804, Victor de Broglie became the third duc de Broglie.

Under the care of his stepfather, the young duke received a careful and liberal education and made his &quot;entrée&quot; into the aristocratic and literary society of Paris under the First French Empire. In 1821, his wife Albertine, the daughter of Erik Magnus Staël von Holstein (Albertine&#x27;s biological father may have been Benjamin Constant) and Madame de Staël, gave birth to Albert, who would become the fourth duke of Broglie. His first-born daughter Louise would publish novels and biographies, and be famously painted by Ingres; another son, Auguste, would have an ecclesiastical and academic career.

===Career===
In 1809, de Broglie was appointed a member of the Council of State, over which the emperor Napoleon Bonaparte presided in person. In addition, he was sent by the Emperor on diplomatic missions, as an attaché, to various countries. Though he had never been in sympathy with the principles of the Empire, the duc de Broglie was not one of those who rejoiced at its downfall. In common with all men of experience and sense, he realized the danger to France of the rise to power of the forces of violent reaction. With Decazes and Richelieu, he saw that the only hope for a calm future lay in the reconciliation of the Restoration with the French Revolution. By the influence of his uncle, Amédée de Broglie, his right to a peerage had been recognized, and to his own great surprise he received, in June 1814, a summons from Louis XVIII to the Chamber of Peers. There, after the Hundred Days, he distinguished himself by his courageous defence of Marshal Ney, for whose acquittal he, alone of all the peers, both spoke and voted.

After this defiant act of opposition it was perhaps fortunate that his impending marriage gave him an excuse for leaving the country. On 15 February 1816, he was married at Leghorn to Albertine, baroness Staël von Holstein, the daughter of Madame de Staël. He returned to Paris at the end of the year, but took no part in politics until the elections of September 1816 broke the power of the ultraroyalists and substituted for the &quot;Chambre introuvable&quot; a moderate assembly composed of liberal &quot;Doctrinaires&quot;. De Broglie&#x27;s political attitude during the years that followed is best summed up in his own words:

===The July Monarchy ===

During the last critical years of Charles X&#x27;s reign, de Broglie identified himself with the liberal party – the Doctrinaires, among whom Royer-Collard and Guizot were the most prominent. The July Revolution of 1830 placed him in a difficult position; he knew nothing of the intrigues which placed Louis Philippe on the throne; the revolution accomplished, however, he was ready to uphold the &quot;fait accompli&quot; with characteristic loyalty, and on 9 August 1830 took office in the new government as President of the Council and Minister of Public Worship and Education. As he had foreseen, the ministry was short-lived, and on 2 November he was once more out of office.

During the critical time that followed, he consistently supported the principles which triumphed with the fall of Laffitte, representative of the center-left &quot;Parti du mouvement&quot;, and the accession to power of Casimir Perier, leader of the center-right &quot;Parti de la résistance&quot;, in March 1831. After the death of the latter and the insurrection of June 1832, De Broglie took office once more as Minister for Foreign Affairs (11 October). 

His tenure of the foreign office was coincident with a very critical period in international relations. But for the sympathy of Britain under Palmerston, the July Monarchy would have been completely isolated in Europe, and this sympathy the aggressive policy of France in Belgium and on the Mediterranean coast of Africa had been in danger of alienating. The Belgian crisis had been settled, so far as the two powers were concerned, before De Broglie took office, but the concerted military and naval action for the coercion of the Dutch, which led to the French occupation of Antwerp, was carried out under his auspices. The good understanding of which this was the symbol characterized also the relations of De Broglie and Palmerston during the crisis of the first war of Muhammad Ali with the Porte, and in the affairs of the Spanish peninsula their common sympathy with constitutional liberty led to an agreement for common action, which took shape in the Quadruple Alliance between Britain, France, Spain and Portugal, signed at London on 22 April 1834. De Broglie had retired from office in the March preceding, and did not return to power until March of the following year, when he became head of the cabinet.

One of De Broglie&#x27;s first act on his return was to have the National Assembly ratify the 4 July 1831 treaty with the United States, which it had rejected during his first term. His cabinet also voted the 1835 laws restricting freedom of press, following Giuseppe Fieschi&#x27;s attempted assassination against Louis-Philippe in July 1835.

In 1836, the government having been defeated on a proposal to reduce the five percents tax, he once more resigned.
He had remained in power long enough to prove what honesty of purpose, experience of affairs, and common sense can accomplish when allied with authority. The debt that France and Europe owed him may be measured by comparing the results of his policy with that of his successors under not dissimilar circumstances. He had found France isolated and Europe full of the rumours of war; he left her strong in the English alliance and the respect of Liberal Europe, and Europe freed from the restless apprehensions which were to be stirred into life again by the attitude of Thiers in the Eastern Question and of Guizot in the affair of the Spanish Marriages.
From 1836 to 1848, De Broglie held almost completely aloof from politics, to which his scholarly temperament little inclined him, a disinclination strengthened by the death of his wife on 22 September 1838. His friendship for Guizot, however, induced him to accept a temporary mission in 1845, and in 1847 to go as French ambassador to London.

===Second Republic and Second Empire===
The revolution of 1848 was a great blow to him, for he realized that it meant the final ruin of the constitutional monarchy, in his view the political system best suited to France. He took his seat, however, in the republican National Assembly and in the Convention of 1848, and, as a member of the section known as the &quot;Burgraves&quot;, fought against both socialism and what he foresaw as a coming autocratic reaction. He shared with his colleagues the indignity of the 2 December 1851 coup, and remained for the remainder of his life one of the bitterest enemies of the Second Empire, though he was heard to remark, with that caustic wit for which he was famous, that the empire was the government which the poorer classes in France desired and the rich deserved.

The last twenty years of his life were devoted chiefly to philosophical and literary pursuits. Having been brought up by his stepfather in the sceptical opinions of the time, he gradually arrived at a sincere belief in the Christian religion. &quot;I shall die,&quot; he said, &quot;a penitent Christian and an impenitent Liberal&quot;.

His literary works, though few of them have been published, were rewarded in 1856 by a seat in the Académie française, replacing Louis de Beaupoil de Saint-Aulaire, and he was also a member of the Académie des sciences morales et politiques. In the labors of those learned bodies he took an active and assiduous part.

== Honours ==
*1833: Grand cordon of the Order of Leopold.

==Works==
Besides his &quot;Souvenirs&quot;, in 4 vols. (Paris, 1885–1888), the duc de Broglie left numerous works, of which only some have been published. Of these may be mentioned:
*&quot;Écrits et discours&quot; (3 vols., Paris, 1863);
*&quot;Le libre échange et l&#x27;impôt&quot; (Paris, 1879);
*&quot;Vues sur le gouvernement de la France&quot; (Paris, 1861).
This last was confiscated by the imperial government before publication.

<text>Eysteinn (Swedish: Östen; died ca 600) was a semi-legendary king of Sweden, the son of Eadgils. He was the father of Ingvar. The Eysteinn tumulus &quot;(Östens hög)&quot; in Västerås near Östanbro has been linked to King Eysteinn by some popular historians. 

Eysteinn ruled Sweden at the time when Hrólf Kraki died in Lejre. It was a troubled time when many sea kings ravaged Swedish shores. One of those kings was named Sölve and he was from Jutland (but according to &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot; he was Geatish, see below). At this time Sölve was pillaging in the Baltic Sea. He arrived in Lofond (probably the island of Lovön or the Lagunda Hundred), where Eysteinn was at a feast. Sölve and his men surrounded the house and set it on fire burning everyone inside to death. Then Sölve arrived at Sigtuna (Old Sigtuna) and ordered the Swedes to accept him as king. The Swedes refused and gathered an army that fought against Sölve and his men, but they lost after eleven days. The Swedes had to accept him as king until they rebelled and killed him. 

== Ynglingatal ==
Stanza from Þjóðólfr of Hvinir&#x27;s &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;:

The &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; presents a Latin summary of &quot;Ynglingatal&quot;, older than Snorri&#x27;s quotation (continuing after Eadgils, called &quot;Adils or Athisl&quot;):
&quot;Thorsteins saga Víkingssonar&quot; makes Eysteinn the father of Anund and grandfather of Ingjald and consequently skips Ingvar&#x27;s generation. It adds a second son to Eysteinn named Olaf, who was the king of Fjordane in Norway.

<doc id="602515" wikidata="Q358764" url="?curid=602515" title="Peter Milligan">
<text>Peter Milligan (born 24 June 1961) is a British comic book writer who has written extensively for both British and American comic book industries. In the UK, Milligan has contributed to numerous anthology titles including &quot;2000 AD&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;A1&quot;, and helped launch the magazine &quot;Deadline&quot;. In the US, he is best known for his frequent contributions to DC Comics&#x27; Vertigo imprint, which include the revamped DC properties &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; and &quot;Human Target&quot;, a four-year run on the imprint&#x27;s premier title &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, and original series &quot;Enigma&quot;, &quot;The Extremist&quot;, &quot;Egypt&quot; and &quot;Greek Street&quot;, as well as the Marvel series &quot;X-Statix&quot;, co-created by Milligan and artist Mike Allred.

==Career==
Milligan started his comic career with &quot;Sounds&quot; music paper&#x27;s comic strip &quot;The Electric Hoax&quot;, with Brendan McCarthy, with whom he went to art school. Milligan later moved to write short stories for &quot;2000 AD&quot; in the early 1980s. By 1986, Milligan had his first ongoing strip in &quot;2000AD&quot; called &quot;Bad Company&quot;, with artists Brett Ewins and Jim McCarthy. &quot;Bad Company&quot; was a popular future war story and helped Milligan become better known.

Concurrently, Milligan, Ewins and Brendan McCarthy had been working on the anthology title, &quot;Strange Days&quot; for Eclipse Comics. &quot;Strange Days&quot; featured three strips, &quot;Paradax&quot;, &quot;Freakwave&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Nemo&quot;. Milligan, McCarthy and Ewins produced three issues of this psychedelic comic, it was not a great seller but it picked up a small, loyal readership. The most conventional strip, &quot;Johnny Nemo&quot;, had its own series, while the more quirky &quot;Paradax&quot; had a two-issue series published by Vortex Comics in 1987.

By 1989 Milligan was swapping between strips such as &quot;Bad Company&quot;, while still writing material in &quot;2000AD&quot;, such as &quot;Hewligan&#x27;s Haircut&quot; with artist Jamie Hewlett. Milligan and artist Jim McCarthy created the Steve Ditko-inspired &quot;Bix Barton&quot;. This was first run as a black and white strip for its first outing, &quot;Barton&#x27;s Beasts&quot;; the second strip was called &quot;Carry On Barton&quot; (originally &quot;Carry On Snuffing&quot;). The strip was very popular and was a precursor of &quot;Devlin Waugh&quot; and others.

In 1989 he had his first work published by DC Comics. &quot;Skreemer&quot; was a six-issue mini-series (May 1989 – October 1989) drawn by Brett Ewins that was somewhat lost in the midst of the so-called &quot;British Invasion&quot; of American comics of the time. A dark post-apocalyptic gangster story, it did receive critical acclaim but did not sell well. Milligan was soon to become a regular writer for DC while still working on his more personal comics in the United Kingdom in comics such as &quot;2000 AD&quot;, and its spin-off titles &quot;Crisis&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;.

The 1990s saw Milligan revamp Steve Ditko&#x27;s character &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot; for DC Comics. This proved his most successful American comic, and came at the end of the first wave of the &quot;British Invasion&quot;. With issue No. 33 (March 1993), it became part of the Vertigo imprint. It was cancelled with issue No. 70 (April 1996). A one-off story marking Vertigo&#x27;s tenth anniversary was published in 2003.

Milligan succeeded Grant Morrison on &quot;Animal Man&quot; for a six-issue run in 1990–1991, and became the regular writer of Batman in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in the same year. During an editorial meeting, Milligan presented the idea that led to the creation of Azrael, who became Batman during the &quot;&quot; crossover.

&quot;Skin&quot; (art by Brendan McCarthy) was the story of a young thalidomide skinhead in 1970s London, and his attempts to deal with his disability and the world in general. The strip was due to feature in &quot;Crisis&quot; in 1990 but the publishers Fleetway were worried by the controversial subject matter, plus they were concerned with the use of explicit language in the story. The printers refused to print it, blaming the graphic language and controversial subject matter as a reason. The story remained in limbo until eventually being published as a graphic novel by Tundra Press to little controversy.

Milligan and artist Duncan Fegredo created &quot;Enigma&quot; for Disney Comics&#x27; planned Touchmark imprint. When the Touchmark line was cancelled, the project moved to DC&#x27;s newly launched Vertigo line in 1993. Milligan quickly followed this up with &quot;The Extremist&quot; with artist Ted McKeever. Both titles dealt with taboo subjects for a mainstream publisher, but were applauded for their handling of these subjects.

Milligan and artist Mike Deodato launched the &quot;Elektra&quot; series for Marvel Comics in November 1996. Milligan spent the remainder of the decade writing one-off specials such as &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;The Eaters&quot;, or miniseries like &quot;Egypt&quot; and &quot;Tank Girl&quot; The Odyssey (with its co-creator Jamie Hewlett providing art), as well as acting as advisory editor to Paul Honeyford&#x27;s &quot;Fighting Figurines&quot;. Milligan and Brendan McCarthy&#x27;s psychedelic comic &quot;Rogan Gosh&quot; was reprinted in a collected edition by Vertigo in 1996, after being first serialised six years earlier in &quot;Revolver&quot;.

Milligan rounded out the decade by writing a &quot;The Human Target&quot; four-issue miniseries (April 1999 – July 1999).

Milligan&#x27;s film work includes the screenplay for &quot;Pilgrim&quot; (2000, also known as &quot;Inferno&quot;), starring Ray Liotta. He scripted the 2002 adaptation of the Melvin Burgess novel &quot;An Angel for May&quot;.

In 2001, Marvel Comics&#x27; new editor-in-chief Joe Quesada began revamping the X-Men family of titles. Milligan and artist Mike Allred took over &quot;X-Force&quot; with issue No. 116 (July 2001), and immediately replaced the book&#x27;s Rob Liefeld-styled team with a more satirical one: the Orphan, the Anarchist, U-Go Girl, Phat, Vivisector, Venus Dee Milo, Dead Girl and Doop. &quot;X-Force&quot; was cancelled with issue No. 129 (August 2002), and replaced by a new title, &quot;X-Statix&quot;, with Milligan and Allred continuing as the creative force. Milligan proposed a character based on a resurrected Princess Diana. News spread to the British tabloid newspaper &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, which strongly objected. Eventually the character was altered, as were the references to the British Royal Family. &quot;X-Statix&quot; was cancelled with issue No. 26 (Oct. 2004).

Milligan wrote issues #166–187 of &quot;X-Men&quot;, teamed with artist Salvador Larroca, in 2005. He returned to &quot;The Human Target&quot; with the graphic novel &quot;Final Cut&quot;, followed by all 21 issues of the subsequent series for Vertigo. In 2006, he wrote the &quot;X-Statix Presents: Dead Girl&quot; five-issue miniseries for Marvel collaborating with artist Nick Dragotta and co-creator Mike Allred. The following year he wrote an &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot; limited series for DC and &quot;The Programme&quot; for Wildstorm, starring a Soviet Cold War superhero. Milligan was involved in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; crossover, &quot;&quot;, by writing the lead-in &quot;Batman Annual&quot; No. 26, as well as the parts of the storyline in the &quot;Robin&quot; monthly title.

Milligan scripted for the BBC interactive animated series &quot;Meta4orce&quot; and the &quot;Sub-Mariner: The Depths&quot; limited series for Marvel&#x27;s Marvel Knights imprint.

In late 2008, Milligan was named writer for the long-running Vertigo series &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, and wrote that imprint&#x27;s &quot;Greek Street&quot;, Additionally, for Marvel, he wrote the 2008 one-shot &quot;Moon Knight: Silent Knight&quot;, with artist Laurence Campbell.

In 2010, Milligan was announced as the writer for &quot;Batman&quot; #703, a prelude to the &quot;Bruce Wayne: The Road Home&quot; crossover storyline, although he later clarified that he was not involved in the production of the issue.

Following DC&#x27;s 2011 relaunch, Milligan became the writer of &quot;Red Lanterns&quot;, an ongoing series which debuted in September 2011. He wrote &quot;Justice League Dark&quot;, a spin-off of the Justice League franchise, starring John Constantine and Shade, the Changing Man. up to issue No. 8 (June 2012), following which he moved to &quot;Stormwatch&quot; from issue No. 9 (July 2012). In 2017 and 2018, he penned the revivals of two classic British properties for Titan Comics, &quot;Dan Dare&quot; and &quot;The Prisoner&quot;.

<text>Jakob Nielsen (15 October 1890 in Mjels, Als – 3 August 1959 in Helsingør) was a Danish mathematician known for his work on automorphisms of surfaces. He was born in the village Mjels on the island of Als in North Schleswig, in modern-day Denmark. His mother died when he was 3, and in 1900 he went to live with his aunt and was enrolled in the Realgymnasium. In 1907 he was expelled for being a member of an illicit student club. Nevertheless, he matriculated at the University of Kiel in 1908.

Nielsen completed his doctoral dissertation in 1913. Soon thereafter, he was drafted into the German Imperial Navy. He was assigned to coastal defense. In 1915 he was sent to Constantinople as a military adviser to the Turkish Government. After the war, in the spring of 1919, Nielsen married Carola von Pieverling, a German medical doctor.

In 1920 Nielsen took a position at the Technical University of Breslau. The next year he published a paper in Mathematisk Tidsskrift in which he proved that any subgroup of a finitely generated free group is free. In 1926 Otto Schreier would generalize this result by removing the condition that the free group be finitely generated; this result is now known as the Nielsen–Schreier theorem. Also in 1921 Nielsen moved to the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Copenhagen, where he would stay until 1925, when he moved to the Technical University in Copenhagen. 
He also proved the Dehn–Nielsen theorem on mapping class groups.

Nielsen was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1936 in Oslo.

During World War II some efforts were made to bring Nielsen to the United States as it was feared that he would be assaulted by the Nazis. Nielsen would, in fact, stay in Denmark during the war without being harassed by the Nazis.

In 1951 Nielsen became professor of mathematics at the University of Copenhagen, taking the position vacated by the death of Harald Bohr. He resigned this position in 1955 because of his international undertakings, in particular with UNESCO, where he served on the executive board from 1952 to 1958.

<text>The Great Falls of the Passaic River is a prominent waterfall, high, on the Passaic River in the city of Paterson in Passaic County, New Jersey. One of the United States&#x27; largest waterfalls, it played a significant role in the early industrial development of New Jersey starting in the earliest days of the nation. The falls and surrounding area are protected as part of the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park, administered by the National Park Service. Congress authorized its establishment in 2009.

In 1967 it was designated a National Natural Landmark together with Garret Mountain Reservation. The falls and the surrounding neighborhood have also been designated as a National Historic Landmark District since 1976. The Great Falls&#x27; raceway and power systems were designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark and a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1977.

==History==
===Formation and early history===
Geologically, the falls were formed at the end of the last ice age approximately 13,000 years ago. Formerly the Passaic had followed a shorter course through the Watchung Mountains near present-day Summit. As the glacier receded, the river&#x27;s previous course was blocked by a newly formed moraine. A large lake, called Glacial Lake Passaic, formed behind the Watchungs. As the ice receded, the river found a new circuitous route around the north end of the Watchungs, carving the spectacular falls through the underlying basalt, which was formed approximately 200 million years ago.

The falls later became the site of a habitation of the historic Lenape Native Americans, who followed earlier indigenous cultures in the region. Later, in the colonial era, Dutch settlers developed a community here beginning in the 1690s.

===Industrial development===

In 1778, Alexander Hamilton visited the falls and was impressed by its potential for industry. Later when Hamilton was the nation&#x27;s Secretary of Treasury, he selected the site of the nation&#x27;s first planned industrial city, which he called a &quot;national manufactory.&quot; In 1791, Hamilton helped found the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.), a state-chartered private corporation to fulfill this vision. The town of Paterson was founded by the society and named after New Jersey Governor William Paterson, in appreciation of his efforts to promote the society.

Hamilton commissioned civil engineer Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant, responsible for the layout of the new capital at Washington, D.C., to design the system of canals known as raceways to supply the power for the watermills in the new town. As a result, Paterson became the nucleus for a burgeoning mill industry. In 1792, David Godwin was commissioned to build the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in New Jersey. He subsequently built the first dam on the falls; it was a structure made of wood.

In 1812, this was the site of the state&#x27;s first continuous roll paper mill. Other 19th-century industries that produced goods using the falls as a power source include the Rogers Locomotive Works (1832), Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company, for the Colt revolver (1837), and the construction of the USS &quot;Holland&quot; (SS-1) (1898). The oldest extant structure in the historic district is the Phoenix Mill, built in 1813.

Workers were exploited, especially new immigrants from Europe, who often did not speak English. They began to seek better working conditions. The industrial area became the site of labor unrest, and it was a center for the 1913 Paterson silk strike. Facing harsh conditions in factories, immigrant workers staged numerous strikes during and after the Great War, adding to social tensions of the time. They organized the first labor movements in the United States.

The SUM society continued operation until 1945, when its charter and property were sold to the city of Paterson. The area fell into disuse during a period of restructuring that resulted in a steep decline of industry in the region during the mid to late 20th century. In 1971, concerned residents established the Great Falls Preservation and Development Corporation to restore and redevelop the historic mill buildings and raceways as artifacts of industrial history.

===Great Falls State Park===

The State of New Jersey announced plans for a new urban state park in Paterson surrounding the Great Falls, called Great Falls State Park, in 2007. The master plan for the park called for utilizing surrounding industrial areas for parklands that include a trail network and recreation areas, and creating new areas to view the falls. These plans were superseded by the establishment of Great Falls National Historical Park.

=== National Historical Park ===
On March 30, 2009, President Obama signed the Omnibus Public Land Management Act authorizing the falls as a national historical park, which would provide additional federal protections for the 77-foot waterfall. By 2011, Great Falls State Park and other land along the Passaic River were transferred to the federal government for the creation of the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park. Formal establishment as a unit of the National Park System required action by the Secretary of the Interior, which took place November 7, 2011, when Secretary Salazar formally accepted lands on behalf of the United States, and dedicated the park as the nation&#x27;s 397th park system unit.

== Viewing the falls ==
The Falls are viewable from Haines Overlook Park on the south and Mary Ellen Kramer Park on the north. Drive-by viewing is available from McBride Avenue where it crosses the river just above the Falls. A footbridge over the Falls gorge (historically, the eighth such bridge to span this chasm) also serves as an outlook point. A visitor&#x27;s center at the corner of Spruce and McBride avenues, in the Great Falls Historic District, provides a historical overview of the falls and the industrial and cultural history of Paterson. A record 177,000 visitors went to the Great Falls in 2016.

== National Natural Landmark ==
The Great Falls of Paterson – Garret Mountain is a National Natural Landmark designated in January 1967 and expanded in April 1967 to include nearby Garret Mountain. Together they help demonstrate how jointed basaltic lava flow shaped the geology of the area during the Early Mesozoic period through both extrusion and intrusion.
The designation protects the site from federal development, but not from local and state development. Redevelopment of the decayed adjacent industrial areas has been an ongoing controversial topic. An attempt in the 1990s to redevelop the adjacent Allied Textile Printing Co. (ATP) facility, destroyed by fire in the 1980s, into prefabricated townhouses was initially approved by the city but later repelled by a coalition of local citizens seeking to preserve the historic character of the district.

== Hydroelectric facility ==

The hydroelectric plant at the falls is operated by Eagle Creek Renewable Energy, which is considering commissioning another facility downstream at the Dundee Dam.

The Great Falls hydroelectric plant has three Kaplan type turbines with a total capacity of 10.95 Mwe. Flow through each turbine is 710 cfs, with a total flow of 2,130 cfs, 1,377 MGD. Three 8.5&#x27; diameter penstocks feed the turbines, with a velocity 12.5 ft/sec and 8.5 mph.

== In popular culture ==

The unique history of the Great Falls and the city were described in the five-volume philosophical poem &quot;Paterson&quot; by William Carlos Williams. Among the episodes described in Williams&#x27; poem is the 1827 leap over the falls by Sam Patch, who later became the first known person to perform a stunt at Niagara Falls. The 2016 film &quot;Paterson&quot;, directed by Jim Jarmusch, is partly inspired by the works of Williams and features the falls as a primary location.

The Great Falls were also featured in the pilot of the HBO crime drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, as well as in the series&#x27; sixth episode, in which Mikey Palmice and another associate throw a drug dealer off the bridge and into the falls to his death.

<doc id="602532" wikidata="Q2239765" url="?curid=602532" title="A Design for Life">
<text>&quot;A Design for Life&quot; is a single by Welsh band Manic Street Preachers from their fourth studio album, &quot;Everything Must Go&quot; (1996). It was written by James Dean Bradfield, Sean Moore and Nicky Wire, and produced by Dave Eringa and Mike Hedges. Released on 15 April 1996 by Epic Records, the song debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. The accompanying music video was directed by Pedro Romhanyi.

==Origins==
The title was inspired by the debut Joy Division EP, &quot;An Ideal for Living&quot;. The opening line of the song, &#x27;Libraries gave us power&#x27;, was inspired by the legend &quot;Knowledge is Power&quot; engraved in stone above the top floor central window of the library in Pillgwenlly, Newport, 15 miles from the band&#x27;s home town of Blackwood. The next line, &#x27;then work came and made us free&#x27;, refers to the German slogan that featured above the gates of Nazi concentration camps and which had been used previously by the band in their song &quot;The Intense Humming of Evil&quot; on the album &quot;The Holy Bible&quot;.

The song explores themes of class conflict and working class identity and solidarity, inspired by the band&#x27;s strong socialist convictions. Speaking in 2017, Nicky Wire explained that he &quot;was sick to death with the patronisation of the working class. We’re not just Jeremy Kyle – we did build libraries. My dad was a miner&quot;. Its video exemplifies this theme further. Various slogans promoting compliance and domesticity clash with scenes of fox hunting, Royal Ascot, a polo match and the Last Night of the Proms representing what the band saw as class privilege.

The song was the first to be written and released by the band following the disappearance of figurehead Richey Edwards the previous year. Interviewed in 2014 by &quot;NME&quot; for their &quot;Song Stories&quot; video series, singer and guitarist James Dean Bradfield recalled that the lyrics had come about as a blending of two sets – &quot;Design for Life&quot; and &quot;Pure Motive&quot; – sent to him by bassist Nicky Wire. The music was written &quot;in about ten minutes&quot; and Bradfield was ecstatic with the result. The song &quot;rescued the band&quot; after the disappearance of Edwards, with Wire describing it as &quot;a bolt of light from a severely dark place&quot;. The band approached Mike Hedges to be involved in producing the song after hearing McAlmont &amp; Butler&#x27;s string-laden single &quot;Yes&quot;, which Hedges had worked on.

==Release==
The single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart on 27 April 1996 and was the first in a run of five consecutive releases to be top-10 hits. It spent a total of 14 weeks on the chart, with seven weeks in the UK top 40, being the best performing single by the band, along with &quot;Your Love Alone Is Not Enough&quot;. It has achieved platinum status in the UK (600,000 copies). With &quot;A Design for Life&quot; the band also began a run of 11 years where all their singles charted within the top 20 in the UK until 2007, when &quot;Indian Summer&quot; from &quot;Send Away the Tigers&quot; broke the run by peaking at number 22. The song peaked at number 48 in New Zealand and at number 50 in Australia. In both countries, it only charted for one week. In Ireland, it charted in the top 20, reaching number 17.

The CD single also included the songs &quot;Mr Carbohydrate&quot;, &quot;Dead Passive&quot; and &quot;Dead Trees and Traffic Islands&quot;, while the cassette included a live version of &quot;Bright Eyes&quot;. As part of Record Store Day 2016, 2000 copies were released on 12&quot; vinyl in a copper sleeve.

==Critical reception==
Taylor Parkes from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; named &quot;A Design for Life&quot; Single of the Week, writing, &quot;A rock ballad of mammoth scale, shadowed by massive and foreboding storm cloud strings, hinged on a recurring, lurching chord change that suggests only endless and unresolved anguish, it has, inevitably, a gravity beyond their intention. born from newsprint and speculation — but also an ominous, desolate momentum of its own.&quot; &quot;Music Week&quot; rated the song five out of five and also named it Single of the Week, adding, &quot;The Manics&#x27; return is a lush but stirring epic and their most commercial single to date. Mike Hedge&#x27;s production has brought a more radio-friendly sound to the band and this looks like being their biggest hit yet.&quot;

===Legacy===
The song is referred to in the song &quot;Slide Show&quot; (alongside Beck&#x27;s &quot;Devils Haircut&quot; and Oasis&#x27; &quot;Wonderwall&quot;) on Travis&#x27; 1999 album, &quot;The Man Who&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Cause there is no design for life, There&#x27;s no devil&#x27;s haircut in my mind, There is not a wonderwall to climb or step around&quot;. In May 2007, &quot;NME&quot; magazine placed &quot;A Design for Life&quot; at number 30 in its list of &quot;50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever&quot;. In October 2011 &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 75 on its list of &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot;. In August 2016, American music publication &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;A Design for Life&quot; at number 31 of the &quot;96 Best Alternative Rock Songs of 1996.

On 18 June 2009, the band were invited to officially open the new £15m Cardiff Central Library, unveiling a plaque inscribed with the words to the opening line of the song. At the event, Wire spoke about how his experience with libraries had partly inspired the song. The Cardiff Arms Park Male Voice Choir performed a version of the song, in front of the band, which Wire described as &quot;spine tingling&quot;. Wire later said in an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that the occasion had been a great honour for the band: &quot;For us, it seemed like a chance to give something back to Wales. Seeing one of our lyrics – &quot;Libraries gave us power&quot;, from A Design for Life – inscribed on the opening plaque was in its own way as affecting as playing the Millennium Stadium.&quot;

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;A Design for Life&quot;, directed by Pedro Romhanyi, reflects the song&#x27;s themes. It shows the band playing on an indoor stage in an apparently cold industrial location. Vintage advertising slogans, extolling capitalist ideals, are shown, along with archive footage from the 1950s.

<doc id="602533" wikidata="Q1467760" url="?curid=602533" title="Orlov (diamond)">
<text>The Orlov (sometimes spelled Orloff), also often considered to be the same diamond known as The Great Mughal Diamond, is a large diamond of Indian origin, currently displayed as a part of the Diamond Fund collection of Moscow&#x27;s Kremlin Armoury. It is described as having the shape and proportions of half a chicken&#x27;s egg. In 1774, it was encrusted into the Imperial Sceptre of Russian Empress Catherine the Great.

==History==

The diamond was found in the 17th century in Golconda, India. According to one legend, a French soldier who had deserted during the Carnatic wars in Srirangam disguised himself as a Hindu convert in order to steal it in 1747, when it served as the eye of a temple deity Sriranganathar.

The as yet unnamed stone passed from merchant to merchant, eventually appearing for sale in Amsterdam. Most modern scholars are now convinced that this stone was actually the Great Mogul Diamond. Shaffrass, an Iranian millionaire who then owned the diamond, found an eager buyer in Hovhannes Lazarian who acted on behalf of Count Grigory Grigorievich Orlov. The Count paid a purported 1.4 million Dutch florins for it.

Count Orlov had been romantically involved with Catherine the Great of Russia for many years, and he led the way in the dethronement of her husband in a coup d&#x27;état and the elevation of Catherine to power. Their relationship carried on for many years and produced an illegitimate child, but Catherine eventually forsook Count Orlov for Grigori Alexandrovich Potemkin. Count Orlov was said to have tried to rekindle their romance by offering her the diamond, as it is said he knew she had wished for it. While he failed to regain her affections, Catherine did bestow many gifts upon Count Orlov; these gifts included the Marble Palace in Saint Petersburg. Catherine named the diamond after the Count, and she had her jeweller design a sceptre incorporating the diamond. Now known as the Imperial Sceptre, it was completed in 1774.

==Description==

A description was given by Eric Burton in 1986:
The Orlov is a rarity among historic diamonds, for it retains its original Indian rose-style cut (see diamond cut). Its colour is widely stated as white with a faint bluish-green tinge. Data released by the Kremlin gives the Orlov&#x27;s measurements as 32 millimetres x 35 millimetres x 21 millimetres, its weight being 189.62 carats (37.924 g). The weight is just an estimate – it has not formally been weighed in many years.Lord Twining&#x27;s book &quot;A History of the Crown Jewels of Europe&quot; mentions how once, during a circa 1913 inspection of the crown jewels by the curator, the stone accidentally fell out of its sceptre. He weighed the stone, but did not write down its exact weight. He later said that it was about , which corresponds to the measurement-based estimate.

<text>Amicus Productions was a British film production company, based at Shepperton Studios, England, active between 1962 and 1977. It was founded by American producers and screenwriters Milton Subotsky and Max Rosenberg.

== Films ==

Prior to establishing Amicus, its two producers collaborated on the successful horror film &quot;The City of the Dead&quot; (1960). Amicus&#x27;s first two films were low-budget musicals for the teenage market, &quot;It&#x27;s Trad, Dad!&quot; (1962) and &quot;Just for Fun&quot; (1963). Amicus is best remembered for making a series of portmanteau horror anthologies, inspired by the Ealing Studios film &quot;Dead of Night&quot; (1945). They also made some straight thriller films, often based on a gimmick.

Amicus&#x27;s horror and thriller films are sometimes mistaken for the output of the better-known Hammer Film Productions, due to the two companies&#x27; similar visual style and use of some of the same actors, including Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Unlike the period gothic Hammer films, Amicus productions were usually set in the present day.

Although not an Amicus Productions film, a film version of Harold Pinter&#x27;s play &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; (1968), directed by William Friedkin, was produced by the team of Subotsky and Rosenberg for Palomar Pictures International.

===Portmanteau horror films ===

Amicus released seven portmanteau films; &quot;Dr. Terror&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; (1965), &quot;Torture Garden&quot; (1967), &quot;The House That Dripped Blood&quot; (1971), &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; (1972), &quot;Asylum&quot; (1972), &quot;Vault of Horror&quot; (1973) and &quot;From Beyond the Grave&quot; (1974). These films typically feature four or sometimes five short horror stories, linked by an overarching plot featuring a narrator and those listening to his story.

The casts of these films are invariably composed of name actors, each of whom play a main part in one of the stories—a small proportion of the film as a whole. Along with genre stars like Cushing, Lee and Herbert Lom, Amicus also drew its actors from the classical British stage (Patrick Magee, Margaret Leighton and Ralph Richardson), rising younger actors (Donald Sutherland, Robert Powell and Tom Baker), or former stars in decline (Richard Greene, Robert Hutton, and Terry-Thomas). Some, such as Joan Collins, were in their mid-career doldrums when they worked with Amicus, while others such as Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker (later the third and fourth incarnations of the Doctor in the science-fiction series, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) were at the height of their careers.

&quot;Torture Garden&quot;, &quot;The House That Dripped Blood&quot; and &quot;Asylum&quot; were written by Robert Bloch, based upon his own stories. An exception was the &quot;Waxworks&quot; segment of &quot;The House That Dripped Blood&quot;, which was scripted (uncredited) by Russ Jones, based on Bloch&#x27;s story. &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; were based on stories from EC horror comics from the 1950s.

===Other horror films===

Amicus also produced some conventional chillers, such as &quot;The Skull&quot; (1965), &quot;The Psychopath&quot; (1966), &quot;Scream and Scream Again&quot; (1970), &quot;I, Monster&quot; (1971), &quot;And Now the Screaming Starts!&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Beast Must Die&quot; (1974). &quot;The Skull&quot; was also based on a Bloch story (though scripted by Milton Subotsky). Bloch was also the screenwriter of &quot;The Psychopath&quot; (1966), and wrote the original adaptation of &quot;The Deadly Bees&quot; (based upon H. F. Heard&#x27;s &quot;A Taste for Honey&quot;).

===Science fiction, espionage, drama===

In the mid-1960s, Amicus also produced two films based on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; which had debuted on television in 1963. The films, &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot; (1965) and &quot;Daleks&#x27; Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.&quot; (1966), are the only theatrical film adaptations of the series. In these films, Peter Cushing played &quot;Dr. Who&quot;, a human scientist rather than an alien, with &quot;Who&quot; as his actual surname, disregarding the backstory of the TV series.

Amicus also funded and produced films of other genres. &quot;Danger Route&quot; (1967) was a film version of Christopher Nicole&#x27;s (writing as Andrew York) 1966 spy novel &quot;The Eliminator&quot;, directed by Seth Holt, the only film of the Jonas Wilde series of novels to have been filmed.

Margaret Drabble&#x27;s adaptation of her novel &quot;The Millstone&quot; (1965) was filmed as &quot;A Touch of Love&quot; (1969), and Laurence Moody&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ruthless Ones&quot; (1969) was filmed as &quot;What Became of Jack and Jill?&quot; (1972)

Amicus Productions produced a few science fiction films, including a 1967 double bill of &quot;The Terrornauts&quot; and &quot;They Came from Beyond Space&quot; that were produced when Joseph E. Levine, who Rosenberg had previously worked with, told Rosenberg that if Amicus could produce two films for £200,000, Embassy Pictures would finance and release both of them.

Amicus later produced a trilogy of adaptations of the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, including &quot;The Land That Time Forgot&quot; (1974), &quot;At the Earth&#x27;s Core&quot; (1976), and &quot;The People That Time Forgot&quot; (1977).

== 2000s ==

In 2003, Anchor Bay Entertainment released a five disc DVD box-set of Amicus films in a coffin-shaped container in the UK. In 2005, Amicus was revived to produce homages to the old titles as well as original horror fare. Their first production was Stuart Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Stuck&quot; (2007).

== Resurrection of Amicus ==

In 2023 it was announced that Amicus would recommence film production, led by Lawrie Brewster, Sarah Daly and Megan Tremethick, with support from the Subotsky family. Amicus would produce the upcoming film &quot;In the Grip of Terror&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; reported &quot;The filmmaker (Brewster) and his team are also starting a crowdfunding campaign to facilitate the initial stages of the project. Their goal is far more ambitious than just one film. &#x27;Our aim is to re-establish Amicus Productions as a beacon of independent British horror&#x27;, Brewster said.&quot;

<doc id="602541" wikidata="Q7552122" url="?curid=602541" title="Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures">
<text>The Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.) or Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures was a private state-sponsored corporation founded in 1791 to promote industrial development along the Passaic River in New Jersey in the United States. The company&#x27;s management of the Great Falls of the Passaic River as a powersource for grist mills resulted in the growth of Paterson as one of the first industrial centers in the United States. Under the society&#x27;s long-term management of the falls, the industrialization of the area passed through three great waves, centered first on cotton, then steel, and finally silk, over the course of over 150 years. The venture is considered by historians to have been a forerunner for many public–private partnerships in later decades in the United States.

==History==

===Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s vision===

The society was the brainchild of United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Tench Coxe, who convinced United States Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to support the creation of a quasi-public manufacturing town. Hamilton, who had visited the Great Falls of the Passaic River in 1778, envisioned it as a planned industrial site, using the waterfall as source of mechanical power. The society was chartered by New Jersey under Hamilton&#x27;s direction to exploit the falls for this planned city, which Hamilton called a &quot;national manufactory&quot;. The enterprise was exempt from property taxes for ten years. The society founded the city of Paterson in the vicinity of the falls, naming it in honor of William Paterson, the governor of New Jersey. Hamilton commissioned civil engineer Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant, responsible for the layout of the new capital at Washington, D.C. to design the system of canals known as raceways supplying the power for the watermills in the new town.

The chartering of the company as a state-favored enterprise, exempt from certain taxes, became the prototype for such public-private enterprises in the 19th century. Contemporaries such as George Logan criticized the SUM for these privileges, as well as for importing what they saw as the stratified class relations and economic dependence of the Old World.

===Shift in strategy===

By 1796, the society&#x27;s efforts to build its own mills had failed, largely because the slow profits it generated were not enough to cover its start-up costs. In 1791 the Society had brought in one Thomas Marshall, who claimed to have been superintendent of the Masson Mill in England, to take charge. However it would seem that he was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, the society successfully promoted real estate development in the area, leasing sites to other private ventures to establish their own mills while maintaining control of the falls as a power source through ownership of the dams and raceways that supplied the mills. The company&#x27;s management of the falls subsequently became a lucrative source of profits as the area became the nucleus for a burgeoning mill industry. By 1815, thirteen water-powered cotton mills were operating beside the falls, operated by over 2,000 workers. As a result of the society&#x27;s success in promoting industry, the population of Paterson grew from 500 in the 1790s to over 5,000 by 1820.

In 1830, the society was involved in a dispute with the recently formed Morris Canal and Banking Company, which had been chartered to build a canal connecting the Passaic River to the Delaware River. The Morris Canal Company had placed a dam on the Rockaway River and diverted water for its own purposes, thus reducing the volume of flow over the falls and threatening the society&#x27;s ventures. The subsequent court decision allowed the Morris Canal to be built without disrupting the water supply to the falls.

The company&#x27;s harnessing of the falls for mill operations was described in 1834 by publisher Thomas Gordon who wrote in the &quot;Gazetteer of the State of New Jersey&quot;:

:A dam of 4 feet high, strongly framed and bolted into the rock in the bed of the river above the falls, turns the stream through a canal excavated in the traprock of the bank, into a basin; whence, through strong guardgates, it supplies in succession three canals on separate planes, each below the other; giving to the mills on each, a head and fall of about 22 feet. By means of the guardgate, the volume of water is regulated at pleasure, and uniform height preserved...The expense of maintaining the dam, canals, and main sluicegates, and of regulating the water, is borne by the company.

===Evolution of local industry===

During the 19th century, the success of mill operations attracted many immigrants experienced in mill operations from England, Scotland, Ireland and other areas of Europe. Some artisans brought with them illegal copies of British mill operations which were subsequently duplicated in Paterson.

By the 1830s, the textile mill industry in the area had been surpassed by larger and better-capitalized steam-powered operations in New England. As a result, the local mill industry shifted toward the manufacture of steel and locomotives. The Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works, which began operating in 1832, was the first such success. By the time of the American Civil War, the milling of steel and the manufacture of locomotives had become the dominant industry. In the 1880s, the area became the center of the nation&#x27;s silk industry.

The society continued operations into the 20th century but fell into decline with the abandonment of the area by industry. In 1945, the society&#x27;s charter and property were acquired by the city of Paterson.

<doc id="602542" wikidata="Q5896336" url="?curid=602542" title="Honk!">
<text>Honk! is a musical adaptation of the 1843 Hans Christian Andersen story &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, incorporating a message of tolerance. The book and lyrics are by Anthony Drewe and music is by George Stiles (of the British songwriting duo Stiles and Drewe). The musical is set in the countryside and features Ugly – a cygnet who is mistaken as an ugly duckling upon falling into his mother&#x27;s nest and is rejected by everyone but Ida (his mother), a sly tomcat who only befriends him out of hunger, and several other barnyard characters.

The musical opened at the Watermill Theatre in England in 1993. The West End production opened in 1999 and won the 2000 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical

The show is frequently produced by schools, as well as regional and community theatre groups in Britain, the U.S. and Canada.

==Production history==
;Newbury, England
A version of &quot;Honk!&quot; opened in 1993 at The Watermill Theatre in Newbury, England, originally titled &quot;The Ugly Duckling or the Aesthetically Challenged Farmyard Fowl&quot;, with Craig Purnell creating the titular character. It returned to the Watermill Theatre in December 2007. Both productions were directed by Steven Dexter.

;Scarborough, England
The original production of &quot;Honk!&quot; officially opened in 1997, directed by Julia McKenzie, at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, England.

;West End
The West End production opened on 11 December 1999 at The Royal National Theatre in London and won the 2000 Olivier Award for Best New Musical. In Ireland the Dublin Premiere of the show received a nomination for Best Show in 2003 from the Association of Irish Musicals and came in second place in the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera for 2004.

;Nyack
&quot;Honk!&quot; made its U.S. premiere at the Helen Hayes Performing Arts Center (since 2006 known as the Riverspace Arts in Nyack) in Nyack, New York in February 2000. Although somewhat well received, the Nyack production had a rough start. Just a week before opening the show was quickly re-imagined and restaged, having replaced a key member of the creative team.

;North Shore Music Theatre

A slightly re-written production with a script more oriented to Americans opened at the North Shore Music Theatre in the same year as the Nyack production and had the same male lead, Gavin Creel, as Ugly. The NSMT production used almost the entire original creative team from Great Britain, with an American lighting designer. In its three-week run, over 30 regional theatres from around the US were inspired to include the show in their next season. Changes included the Turkey having a fear of Thanksgiving instead of Christmas, and the first line of the song, &quot;A Poultry Tale&quot; being changed from &quot;In this backwater of England&quot; to &quot;In our patch behind the farmhouse&quot;. This version is licensed in the United States by Music Theatre International.

;2017 London Revival, Union Theatre
The 20th anniversary revival, directed by Andy Room, featured a cast of only seven, actor-musicians and was the first production to substitute the child cast for puppets. It featured some updated references in the script and was nominated for an Off West End Award for Best Production for Young People 8+.

;UK Tour, National Youth Music Theatre

In 2017, the National Youth Music Theatre toured a production of &quot;Honk the Musical&quot; around the UK to venues such as Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds and The Rose Theatre, Kingston.

;2019 UK Tour
In 2019, an updated version of the 2017 Revival will tour the UK.

== Recordings ==
An original cast album from the Scarborough production was released in 1998. Stiles and Drewe released the original demo recording in 2008. This features Claire Moore, Joanna Riding, Clive Rowe, Jenna Russell and the writers themselves.

==Characters==
*These characters do not appear in &quot;Honk! Jr.&quot; (see below)

**The character can be male or female. Should the role be played by a female, the character will be renamed Maggie Pie. The US version is called Jay Bird rather than Jack Daw, and the TV show is renamed &quot;America&#x27;s Most Feathered&quot;.

==Plot==
;Act I
It is Spring, and Drake thinks about life on the farm. (&quot;A Poultry Tale&quot;). As he attempts to sneak away, Ida scolds him for neglecting their eggs that are about to hatch. Drake believes one huge egg is a turkey&#x27;s egg, but Ida is doubtful. Ida expresses &quot;The Joy of Motherhood&quot; and is joined by her friend Maureen, when all of the &quot;normal&quot; eggs hatch. Drake takes the ducklings to learn to swim, leaving Ida to wait for the fifth egg to hatch (&quot;Different&quot; pre-reprise). It finally hatches to reveal Ugly. Ida is initially shocked but is overjoyed that the new arrival is not a turkey. As she teaches him to swim, she notices his amazing talent (&quot;Hold Your Head Up High&quot;).

When Drake and the ducklings return, they are aghast at Ugly&#x27;s appearance and, along with Maureen, Henrietta, the Turkey, and everyone else, make fun of him, while the Cat admires what a great meal he would be (&quot;Look At Him&quot;). As Ugly tries and fails to &quot;quack,&quot; he realises he isn&#x27;t the same as the others (&quot;Different&quot;). The Cat offers to be Ugly&#x27;s friend and to treat him to lunch, which he happily accepts. Ugly tries to get Ida&#x27;s permission, but she is too busy with the other ducklings. After Ugly leaves with the Cat, Ida realises Ugly is missing. Everyone splits up to look for him.

In his lair, the Cat is preparing to eat Ugly, who is unaware of the danger (&quot;Play with Your Food&quot;). Just as the Cat is about to strike, the children playing outside send a ball flying through the window, hitting the Cat and causing him to fall into the pot. Ugly thinks he is hiding and goes to find a hiding place of his own, but ends up getting &quot;Lost&quot;. Back at the duckyard, no one can find Ugly, and they mourn him (&quot;The Elegy&quot;), but Ida refuses to believe he is dead. Jay Bird (or Maggie Pie), interrupts and begins to interview Ida for &quot;Britain&#x27;s Most Feathered&quot;. Ida laments about what it&#x27;s like to lose one of your children (&quot;Every Tear a Mother Cries&quot;). Ida continues to search for Ugly, leaving her other four ducklings with Drake.

Meanwhile, Ugly comes across two military geese, Greylag and Dot, and begs for their help. They and their &quot;squadron&quot; of geese decide to go on a reconnaissance mission to find Ugly&#x27;s home (&quot;Wild Goose Chase&quot;). However, there is a shoot going on in the marsh, so the Cat sneaks in and offers to help out by telling them when the shoot is over, hoping that they will leave him alone with Ugly. Greylag sees through the Cat&#x27;s plan and takes him along. The Geese and the Cat head off to the shoot, which is still going on, and get shot down. Ugly, who didn&#x27;t go on the mission with them, realises that the Cat is evil and had lied. Ida sets off to find Ugly, and they both vow to find each other and be reunited. (&quot;Hold Your Head Up High&quot; Reprise).

;Act II
Ugly wanders into a house and meets Queenie and Lowbutt, a domesticated cat and chicken. They too make fun of him not only for his looks but also for not being of &quot;their sort&quot; (&quot;It Takes All Sorts&quot;). When they turn on the TV, they see Ida and Jay Bird broadcasting a missing notice for Ugly. Ugly recognises his mother and Queenie goes to call the advertised number. Just then the doorbell rings, and the Cat enters, poorly disguised as Drake. Ugly sees through the disguise, but Lowbutt believes he is actually Ugly&#x27;s father. But when Queenie comes back in, the Cat falls in love. Queenie also thinks he is a duck, but she too falls in love when he removes his disguise (&quot;Together&quot;). Lowbutt is dismayed, so she helps Ugly to escape, leaving the Cat to decide between his meal and Queenie. He chooses to go after Ugly, leaving Lowbutt to console Queenie.

Back at the farmyard, Drake is forced into some responsibility, and, now that the ducklings are almost a year old, they are beginning to give Drake a hard time as teenagers. Ida, still searching for Ugly, comes across everyone that Ugly has met (&quot;The Collage&quot;). Meanwhile, Ugly finds Penny, a swan, caught in some fishing line and untangles her. Penny, knowing Ugly is a swan, invites him to migrate with her, but Ugly insists that he can&#x27;t. As Penny flies away, Ugly realises he is in love with her (&quot;Now I&#x27;ve Seen You&quot;), but is sad because he believes she could never love someone as ugly as himself. Just then, a Bullfrog comes hopping by. Noticing his bad mood, he tells Ugly about how &quot;ugliness&quot; is just a matter of taste and that someone out there will always love you &quot;Warts and All&quot;. The song cheers Ugly up, and the bullfrog leaves. Suddenly, a net drops on Ugly&#x27;s head. A farmer has caught him for his family&#x27;s Sunday roast. When the Farmer goes to get his knife, the Cat sneaks back onstage and offers a deal; he will lead Ugly back to the farm, but Ugly has to promise to be the Cat&#x27;s lunch. Ugly agrees, and both of them head back to the farmyard.

On the way, the two get caught in a blizzard and freeze (&quot;The Blizzard&quot;). Ida unfortunately has gotten caught in it as well. Ida notices them and believes Ugly is dead. Penny and her family come to Ida and tell her to cry, that her tears of hope will save Ugly. Soon Ugly wakes up and realises he is not a duck, but a swan, then reunites with his mother (&quot;Transformation&quot;). Penny recognises that Ugly is the one who saved her earlier and the two confess their love to each other. The swans invite Ugly to come learn their ways. Although Ugly wants to stay with Ida, she insists that he go with the swans. As they fly off, Ida sings of how Ugly was different, but Ugly suddenly reappears with Penny, as they have decided to stay with Ida. Just before they leave, Ugly frees the Cat, who has remained frozen this entire time. As the Cat notices Ugly is not a duck but a swan, he goes insane before running away in defeat (&quot;Melting Moggy&quot;).

Ugly, Penny and Ida return to the lake; everyone loves Ugly now that he is a swan. They ask for his forgiveness for making fun of him (&quot;Look At Him&quot; Reprise). Ugly happily accepts their apology and introduces Penny. Grace decides to relinquish the Red Band, now the Cygnet Ring, to Ugly, dubbing him &quot;the finest bird on the lake&quot;.

==&quot;Honk! Jr.&quot;==
A junior version of &quot;Honk!&quot; has been made for younger audiences. There are slight changes in &quot;Honk! Jr.&quot;, notably the Cat could be played by either a male or female. Because of this, the characters Queenie and Lowbutt do not appear in this version, nor do the songs &quot;It Takes All Sorts&quot; and &quot;Together&quot;. Certain songs are cut (see the song list above), whilst others, such as &quot;Look At Him&quot; are shortened with the lyrics slightly changed. The lyrics in &quot;Warts and All&quot; were also changed slightly to appeal to younger audiences. &quot;The Wild Goose Chase&quot;, a song that normally appears at the end of the first act, opens Act 2 to fill the gap normally filled by Queenie and Lowbutt.

<text>Alpha cells (α-cells) are endocrine cells that are found in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Alpha cells secrete the peptide hormone glucagon in order to increase glucose levels in the blood stream.

== Discovery ==
Islets of Langerhans were first discussed by Paul Langerhans in his medical thesis in 1869. This same year, Édouard Laguesse named them after Langerhans. At first, there was a lot of controversy about what the Islets were made of and what they did. It appeared that all of the cells were the same within the Islet, but were histologically distinct from acini cells. Laguesse discovered that the cells within the Islets of Langerhans contained granules that distinguished them from acini cells. He also determined that these granules were products of the metabolism of the cells in which they were contained. Michael Lane was the one to discover that alpha cells were histologically different than beta cells in 1907.

Before the function of alpha cells was discovered, the function of their metabolic product, glucagon, was discovered. The discovery of the function of glucagon coincides with the discovery of the function of insulin. In 1921, Banting and Best were testing pancreatic extracts in dogs that had had their pancreas removed. They discovered that &quot;insulin-induced hypoglycemia was preceded by a transient, rather mild hyperglycemia...&quot; Murlin is credited with the discovery of glucagon because in 1923 they suggested that the early hyperglycemic effect observed by Banting and Best was due to &quot;a contaminant with glucogenic properties that they also proposed to call &#x27;glucagon,&#x27; or the mobilizer of glucose&quot;. In 1948, Sutherland and de Duve established that alpha cells in the pancreas were the source of glucagon.

== Anatomy ==
Alpha cells are endocrine cells, meaning they secrete a hormone, in this case glucagon. Alpha cells store this glucagon in secretory vesicles that typically have an electron dense core and a grayish outer edge. It is believed that alpha cells make up approximately 20% of endocrine cells within the pancreas. Alpha cells are most commonly found on the dorsal side of the pancreas and are very rarely found on the ventral side of the pancreas. Alpha cells are typically found in compact Islets of Langerhans, which are themselves typically found in the body of the pancreas.

==Function==
Alpha cells function in the maintenance of blood glucose levels. Alpha cells are stimulated to produce glucagon in response to hypoglycemia, epinephrine, amino acids, other hormones, and neurotransmitters.

=== Glucagon Secretion and Control of Gluconeogenesis ===
Glucagon functions to signal the liver to begin gluconeogenesis which increases glucose levels in the blood. Glucagon will bind to the glucagon receptors on the plasma membranes of hepatocytes (liver cells). This ligand binding causes the activation of adenylate cyclase, which causes the creation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). As the intracellular concentration of cAMP rises, protein kinase A (PKA) is activated and phosphorylates the transcription factor cAMP Response Element Binding (CREB) protein. CREB then induces transcription of glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCK). These enzymes increase gluconeogenic activity. PKA also phosphorylates phospho-fructokinase 2 (PFK2)/fructose 2,6-biphsophatase (FBPase2), inhibiting PFK2 and activating FBPase2. This inhibition decreases intracellular levels of fructose 2,6-biphosphate and increases intracellular levels of fructose 6-phosphate which decreases glycolytic activity and increases gluconeogenic activity. PKA also phosphorylates pyruvate kinase which causes an increase in intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-biphosphate and decreases intracellular levels of pyruvate, further decreasing glycolytic activity. The most important action of PKA in regulating gluconeogenesis is the phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase which acts to initiate the glycogenolysis reaction, which is the conversion of glycogen to glucose, by converting glycogen to glucose 1-phosphate.

Alpha cells also generate Glucagon-like peptide-1 and may have protective and regenerative effect on beta cells. They possibly can transdifferentiate into beta cells to replace lost beta cells.

== Regulation of glucagon secretion ==
There are several methods of control of the secretion of glucagon. The most well studied is through the action of extra-pancreatic glucose sensors, including neurons found in the brain and spinal cord, which exert control over the alpha cells in the pancreas. Indirect, non-neuronal control has also been found to influence secretion of glucagon.

=== Neuronal Control ===
The most well studied is through the action of extra-pancreatic glucose sensors, including neurons found in the brain, which exert control over the alpha cells in the pancreas. The pancreas is controlled by both the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system, although the method these two systems use to control the pancreas appears to be different.

Sympathetic control of the pancreas appears to originate from the sympathetic preganglionic fibers in the lower thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. According to Travagli et al. &quot;axons from these neurons exit the spinal cord through the ventral roots and supply either the paravertebral ganglia of the sympathetic chain via communicating rami of the thoracic and lumbar nerves, or the celiac and mesenteric ganglia via the splanchnic nerves. The catecholaminergic neurons of these ganglia innervate the intrapancreatic ganglia, islets and blood vessels...&quot; The exact nature of the effect of sympathetic activation on the pancreas has been difficult to discern. However, a few things are known. It appears that stimulation of the splanchnic nerve lowers plasma insulin levels possibly through the action of α2 adrenoreceptors on beta cells. It has also been shown that stimulation of the splanchnic nerve increases glucagon secretion. Both of these findings together suggest that sympathetic stimulation of the pancreas is meant to maintain blood glucose levels during heightened arousal.

Parasympathetic control of the pancreas appears to originate from the Vagus nerve. Electrical and pharmacological stimulation of the Vagus nerve increases secretion of glucagon and insulin in most mammalian species, including humans. This suggests that the role of parasympathetic control is to maintain normal blood glucose concentration under normal conditions.

=== Non-neuronal Control ===
Non-neuronal control has been found to be indirect paracrine regulation through ions, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Zinc, insulin, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid, and γ-hydroxybutyrate, all of which are released by beta cells in the pancreas, have been found to suppress glucagon production in alpha cells. Delta cells also release somatostatin which has been found to inhibit glucagon secretion.

Zinc is secreted at the same time as insulin by the beta cells in the pancreas. It has been proposed to act as a paracrine signal to inhibit glucagon secretion in alpha cells. Zinc is transported into both alpha and beta cells by the zinc transporter ZnT8. This protein channel allows zinc to cross the plasma membrane into the cell. When ZnT8 is under-expressed, there is a marked increase in glucagon secretion. When ZnT8 is over-expressed, there is a marked decrease in glucagon secretion. The exact mechanism by which zinc inhibits glucagon secretion is not known.

Insulin has been shown to function as a paracrine signal to inhibit glucagon secretion by the alpha cells. However, this is not through a direct interaction. It appears that insulin functions to inhibit glucagon secretion through activation of delta cells to secrete somatostatin. Insulin binds to SGLT2 causing an increased glucose uptake into delta cells. SGLT2 is a sodium and glucose symporter, meaning that it brings glucose and sodium ions across the membrane at the same time in the same direction. This influx of sodium ions, in the right conditions, can cause a depolarization event across the membrane. This opens calcium channels, causing intracellular calcium levels to increase. This increase in the concentration of calcium in the cytosol activates ryanodine receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum which causes the release of more calcium into the cytosol. This increase in calcium causes the secretion of somatostatin by the delta cells.

Somatostatin inhibits glucagon secretion through the activation of SSTR2, a membrane bound protein that when activated causes a hyperpolarization of the membrane. This hyperpolarization causes voltage gated calcium channels to close, leading to a decrease in intracellular calcium levels. This causes a decrease in exocytosis. In the case of alpha cells, this causes a decrease in the secretion of glucagon.

Serotonin inhibits the secretion of glucagon through its receptors on the plasma membrane of alpha cells. Alpha cells have 5-HT1f receptors which are triggered by the binding of serotonin. Once activated, these receptors suppress the action of adenylyl cyclase, which suppresses the production of cAMP. The inhibition of the production of cAMP in turn suppresses the secretion of glucagon. Serotonin is considered a paracrine signal due to the close proximity of beta cells to alpha cells.

Glucose can also have a somewhat direct influence on glucagon secretion as well. This is through the influence of ATP. Cellular concentrations of ATP directly reflects the concentration of glucose in the blood. If the concentration of ATP drops in alpha cells, this causes potassium ion channels in the plasma membrane to close. This causes depolarization across the membrane causing calcium ion channels to open, allowing calcium to flood into the cell. This increase in the cellular concentration of calcium causes secretory vesicles containing glucagon to fuse with the plasma membrane, thus causing the secretion of glucagon from the pancreas.

== Medical significance ==
High levels of glucagon secretion has been implicated in both Type I and Type II diabetes. In fact, high levels of plasma glucagon is considered an early sign of the development of both Type I and Type II diabetes.

=== Type I Diabetes ===
It is thought that high glucagon levels and lack of insulin production are the main triggers for the metabolic issues associated with Type I diabetes, in particular maintaining normal blood glucose levels, formation of ketone bodies, and formation of urea. One finding of note is that the glucagon response to hypoglycemia is completely absent in patients with Type I diabetes. Consistently high glucagon concentrations in the blood can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is when ketones from lipid breakdown build up in the blood, which can lead to dangerously low blood glucose levels, low potassium levels, and in extreme cases cerebral edema. It has been proposed that the reason for the high levels of glucagon found in the plasma of patients with Type I diabetes is the absence of beta cells producing insulin and the reciprocal effect this has on delta cells and the secretion of somatostatin.

=== Type II Diabetes ===
Patients with Type II diabetes will have elevated glucagon levels during a fast and after eating. These elevated glucagon levels over stimulate the liver to undergo gluconeogenesis, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. Consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to organ damage, neuropathy, blindness, cardiovascular issues and bone and joint problems. It is not entirely clear why glucagon levels are so high in patients with Type II diabetes. One theory is that the alpha cells have become resistant to the inhibitory effects of glucose and insulin and do not respond properly to them. Another theory is that nutrient stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract, thus the secretion of gastric inhibitory polypeptide and Glucagon-like peptide-1, is a very important factor in the elevated secretion of glucagon.

== In other species ==
There is much controversy as to the effects of various artemisinin derivatives on α-cell-to-β-cell differentiation in rodents and zebrafish. Li &quot;et al.&quot;, 2017 find artemisinin itself forces α⇨β conversion in rodents (via gephyrin) and zebrafish while Ackermann &quot;et al.&quot;, 2018 find artesunate does not and van der Meulen &quot;et al.&quot;, 2018 find the same absence of effect for artemether (although artemether does inhibit ARX). (Shin &quot;et al.&quot;, 2019 further finds no such effect for GABA in rhesus macaque, although GABA is not an artemisinin but has a related action.) Both Eizirik &amp; Gurzov 2018 and Yi &quot;et al.&quot;, 2020 consider it possible that these are all legitimately varying results from varying combinations of substance, subject, and environment. On the other hand, a large number of reviewers are uncertain whether these are separate effects, instead questioning the validity of Li on the basis of Ackermann and van der Meulen – perhaps GABA receptor agonists as a whole are &quot;not&quot; β-cell-ergic. Coppieters &quot;et al.&quot;, 2020 goes further, highlighting Ackermann and van der Meulen as publications that catch an unreplicatable scientific result, Li.

<text>Klephts (; Greek , &quot;kléftis&quot;, pl. , &quot;kléftes&quot;, which means &quot;thieves&quot; and perhaps originally meant just &quot;brigand&quot;) were highwaymen turned self-appointed armatoloi, anti-Ottoman insurgents, and warlike mountain-folk who lived in the countryside when Greece was a part of the Ottoman Empire. They were the descendants of Greeks who retreated into the mountains during the 15th century in order to avoid Ottoman rule. Klepht bands also included many ethnic Albanians. They carried on a continuous war against Ottoman rule and remained active as brigands until the 19th century.

The terms kleptomania and kleptocracy are derived from the same Greek root, κλέπτειν (&quot;kléptein&quot;), &quot;to steal&quot;.

==Origins==
After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 and then the fall of Mistra in the Despotate of the Morea, most of the plains of present-day Greece fell entirely into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. The only territories that did not fall under Ottoman rule were the mountain ranges (populated by Greeks and inaccessible to the Ottoman Turks), as well as a handful of islands and coastal possessions under the control of Venice. This situation lasted until 1821. However, the later acquired territories of Greece, such as Macedonia, Thrace and Epirus, were in Turkish hands until the 20th century. This period of time in Greece is known as the Turkocracy.

Ottoman lands were divided up into pashaliks, also called eyalets; in the case of the lands that form present-day Greece, these were Morea and Roumelia. Pashaliks were further sub-divided into sanjaks which were often divided into feudal chifliks (Turkish (farm), Greek ). Any surviving Greek troops, whether regular Byzantine forces, local militia, or mercenaries had either to join the Ottoman army as janissaries, serve in the private army of a local Ottoman notable, or fend for themselves. Many Greeks wishing to preserve their Greek identity, Orthodox Christian religion, and independence chose the difficult but liberated life of a bandit. These bandit groups soon found their ranks swelled with impoverished and/or adventurous peasants, societal outcasts, and escaped criminals.

Klephts under Ottoman rule were generally men who were fleeing vendettas or taxes, debts and reprisals from Ottoman officials. They raided travelers and isolated settlements and lived in the rugged mountains and back country. Most klephtic bands participated in some form in the Greek War of Independence. During the Greek War of Independence, the klephts, along with the armatoloi, formed the nucleus of the Greek fighting forces, and played a prominent part throughout its duration. Despite being ineffective, they were the only viable military force for the provisional governments of the 1821–1827 period. During that time period, three attempts were made at creating a regular army, and one of the reasons for their failure was the resistance of the klepht and armatoles leaders. Yannis Makriyannis referred to the &quot;klephtes and armatoloi&quot; as the &quot;yeast of liberty&quot;. John Koliopoulos studied the klephts in the 19th century, and stated that the principle of kinship and honour seen in Albanian could be seen among the klephts after centuries of contact with Albanian irregulars.

Contrary to conventional Greek history, many of the klephts and armatoles participated at the Greek War of Independence according to their own militaristic patron-client terms. They saw the war as an economic and political opportunity to expand their areas of operation. Balkan bandits such as the klephts and armatoles – glorified in nationalist historiography as national heroes – were actually driven by economic interests, were not aware of national projects, made alliances with the Ottomans and robbed Christians as much as Muslims.

==Songs==

Klephtic songs (), or ballads, were developed in mainland Greece. They are part of the Greek folk music genre, which includes folk poetry, and are thematically oriented on either the achievements and death of a single klepht or the generic life of the klephts as a group. Klephtic songs are especially popular in Epirus and the Peloponnese. The Czech composer Antonín Dvořák wrote a song-cycle named &quot;Three Modern Greek Poems&quot;: the first one is entitled &quot;Koljas – Klepht Song&quot; and tells the story of Koljas, the klepht who killed the famous Ali Pasha.

The most famous klephtic and modern Greek folk song is &quot;The Battle of Mount Olympus and Mount Kisavos&quot;, a ballad based on a musico-poetic motif dating back to classical Greece (specifically to the poetic song composed by Corinna pertaining to a contest between Mount Helicon and Mount Cithaeron).

==Cuisine==
The famous Greek dish &quot;klephtiko&quot; (or kleftiko), a dish entailing slow-cooked lamb (or other meat), can be translated &quot;in the style of the klephts&quot;. The klephts, not having flocks of their own, would steal lambs or goats and cook the meat in a sealed pit to avoid the smoke being seen.

<text>Israel Railways Ltd. (, &quot;Rakevet Yisra&#x27;el&quot;) is the state-owned principal railway company responsible for all inter-city, commuter, and freight rail transport in Israel. Israel Railways network consists of of track. All its lines are standard gauge but some were originally built to other gauges and later regauged. Electrification began in 2018 with the new line to Jerusalem and there are ambitious plans to electrify the entire network at 25 kV 50 Hz supplied via overhead line. The network is centered in Israel&#x27;s densely populated coastal plain, from which lines radiate out in many directions. In 2018, Israel Railways carried 68 million passengers.

Unlike road vehicles and city trams, Israeli heavy rail trains run on the left hand tracks, matching neighboring Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries, whose formerly connected rail networks were constructed by British engineers. Those lines that formerly crossed Israel&#x27;s borders were severed during the 1948 Palestine war and there are no international train lines or services to or from Israel. 

Until 1980, the company&#x27;s head office was located at Haifa Center HaShmona railway station. Tzvi Tzafriri, the general manager of Israel Railways, decided to move the head office to Tel Aviv–Savidor Center railway station. In 2017, the company&#x27;s head office was moved to a new campus built on the grounds of the Lod railway station.

==Stations==
There are 66 stations on the Israel Railways network, with almost all of the stations being accessible to disabled persons, with public announcement and passenger information systems, vending machines and parking.

===Bicycle policy===
Bicycles are permitted on trains in designated coaches.

Israel Railways encourages people to use bicycles by building a double-deck parking for bicycles in every railway station and by allowing people to take bicycles with them on trains to minimise the need for private cars.

===Smoking===
In Israel, smoking is prohibited in public enclosed places and in commercial areas. Although smoking in railway stations is allowed in designated areas, the sale of tobacco from automated vending machines is prohibited.

=== List of stations ===

== Lines ==
Israel Railways currently operates 15 passenger service lines. These can be broadly subdivided into inter-city lines, which connect two or more of Israel&#x27;s major metropolitan centres (Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, and Beersheba), usually skipping some of the intermediate stations, and commuter lines, centered on one metropolitan area and serving all stations on the line. However, Israel Railways no longer officially uses this classification.

Some services were partially or fully suspended as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and electrification works.

===Inter-city lines===
===Commuter lines===
† Fully electrified line
‡ Line electrification in progress

== Future ==

=== Electrification ===
Since the opening of the fully-electrified Tel Aviv–Ben Gurion Airport–Jerusalem railway line in 2018, work has been underway to electrify the passenger rail network with overhead 25 kV 50 Hz AC electrification. In 2024, Israel Railways estimated that work was 70% complete, with full electrification officially scheduled for 2027.

=== Network expansion ===
Due to increasing demand, Israel Railways is pursuing expansion to its infrastructure network.

The long Eastern Railway, which will connect Hadera to Kfar Saba in parallel to the Coastal Railway, began construction in 2019 and is scheduled to open in 2027. This line follows the disused route of the Ottoman-period Tulkarm–Lydda railroad, which was abandoned in 1968, and will allow freight and passenger trains to bypass the congested Hadera–Herzliya corridor.

The Rishon LeZion–Modi&#x27;in Railway also began construction in 2019, with opening planned in 2026. This line will create an east-west link south of Tel Aviv, crossing the Tel Aviv–Ashkelon, Tel Aviv–Beersheba and Tel Aviv–Jerusalem rail corridors.

Since 2019, work is underway to quadruple the section of the Ayalon Railway from Tel Aviv Center to Tel Aviv HaHagana, which forms a critical bottleneck for the entire rail network. Upon completion, this project will nearly double the capacity of the corridor, allowing a significant increase in train frequency across the network. Completion is scheduled for 2028.

=== Plans and proposals ===

A line from the city of Acre, on the Mediterranean coast, to Karmiel was completed in March 2017. However, this tract bypasses Acre and does not make a stop there; it is planned to be extended north to the north-eastern town of Qiryat Shemona, with future stations also planned for Jadeidi-Makr and Majd al-Krum, though there is no timetable for construction. This line will be fully electrified.

There were plans to build a high-speed railway to Eilat but in 2019 the project was frozen indefinitely.

In 2011 the reconstruction and expansion of the long, formerly abandoned Jezreel Valley railway line connecting Haifa and Beit Shean (near the Jordanian border) started. This was completed in 2016. There has been talk of further extending the line to Irbid, in Jordan (to allow a direct freight connection from Jordan to the Mediterranean Sea); however, no decision has yet been made on this matter. Another proposed extension under discussion would connect the reconstructed Jezreel Valley railway at Afula to Tiberias.

In May 2017, an extension of the railway from Arad via Kuseife was approved. The line would connect to the existing Beersheba–Dimona rail line at the proposed new station at Nevatim.

== Rolling stock ==

Israel Railways currently owns a total of 193 locomotives, 717 passenger cars, and 110 MU trainsets.

== Organizational structure ==
The company is headed by a chief executive officer. It has two subsidiaries: a real estate development company, and a freight rail company. The main organization has five operational departments: freight, infrastructure, rolling stock, passengers and development.

In 2017, Israel Railways founded a Tunnels Unit that is responsible for the daily operation of railway tunnels, including lighting, air circulation, etc. and managing emergencies.

 In contemporary shekels – not adjusted for inflation

== Notable accidents ==
*On 26 December 1963 two passenger trains on the then single-track main line linking Tel Aviv and Haifa collided head-on at Bet Yehoshua just south of Netanya. The northbound train had passed a red signal and its locomotive rode over and crushed the locomotive of the southbound train. None of the coaches was derailed but a coupler broke in the northbound train detaching the rear three coaches. The continuous train brake should have then automatically stopped the detached coaches but it had not been connected properly so they started to roll back southwards. 55 people were injured but only three seriously enough to be detained in hospital. The two head-end crews survived but their locomotives, EMD G12s 105 and 118, were destroyed.
*HaBonim disaster: On 11 June 1985 a train collided with a bus carrying school children, killing 19 children and 3 adults, near moshav HaBonim.
*On 21 June 2005 an IC3 train crashed into a freight truck near kibbutz Revadim, killing 8 and injuring 198.
*8 July 2005, a train collided with a truck between Kiryat Gat and Ahuzam, resulting in the death of the train driver and 38 injuries. In February 2012 a plea bargain had been set for the Revadim crash.
*On 12 June 2006 a train crashed into a truck near Beit Yehoshua, killing 5 and injuring from 77 to over 80.
*On 27 December 2009 a train crashed into a car near Kiryat Gat. The driver proceeded without regard to the train checkpoint on the road. The train struck his car and he was killed.
*On 5 August 2010 a train crashed into a minibus near Kiryat Gat, killing 7 and injuring 6. The minibus was hit at 19:05 GMT+3 on Route 353, apparently as it tried to pass over a level crossing.
*On 28 December 2010 a fire started in a train near kibbutz Yakum, probably because of a short circuit, injuring 116.
*On 7 April 2011 two trains collided frontally near Netanya, injuring 59.
*On 4 October 2013, two men walking along railroad tracks in the Emek Hefer valley industrial zone were killed by a train.
*On 18 December 2013, a Beersheba-bound train collided with a group of camels walking along railroad tracks at the Segev Shalom Junction in the Negev, killing 14 camels. The incident caused massive delays in train traffic.
*On 29 December 2013, an Israel Railways worker was run down and killed by a train near Lod.
*On 15 March 2016, an Israel Railways locomotive crashed into freight wagons, injuring 6.

<doc id="602549" wikidata="Q1968774" url="?curid=602549" title="Pancreatic polypeptide cells">
<text>Pancreatic polypeptide cells (PP cells), or formerly as gamma cells (γ-cells), or F cells, are cells in the pancreatic islets (Islets of Langerhans) of the pancreas. Their main role is to help synthesize and regulate the release of pancreatic polypeptide (PP), after which they have been named. The pancreatic islets, where PP cells reside, was discovered in 1869 by a German pathological anatomist and scientist, Paul Langerhans. PP cells help to make up the pancreas but are smallest in proportion to the other cells previously stated. The proportions can vary based on which animals are being studied, but in humans, PP cells make up less than 2% of the pancreatic islet cell population.
== Structure and role ==
The pancreas serves multiple roles within mammalian organisms. It plays a role in the digestive system and the endocrine system making it an organ and a very important gland. PP cells tend to located in the pancreatic islets, and are one of the rarer pancreatic cell types. Some small clusters may also be found surrounded by exocrine pancreas. They tend to be located in the duodenal part of the pancreas more medially. Given their location in pancreatic islets along with their low population, they are able to respond efficiently to changes in blood sugar, nerve impulses, and chemical signaling through gap junctions or cellular signaling. PP cells show the highest concentration at the head of the pancreas.

PP cells play an important role when it comes to the regulation of plasma glucose as they help to synthesize and release pancreatic polypeptide (PP). As PP cells secrete more pancreatic polypeptide, it has been shown to have a negative effect on insulin secretion giving it anorexic effects on intestinal functionality. These cells have been shown to inhibit functions in the gut and decrease intestinal motor activity as well. In other words, as the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide increases, the secretion of insulin, a peptide hormone, starts to decrease. Pancreatic polypeptide also works to regulate glycogen levels and the amount of secreted substances from gastrointestinal cells and tissue. Within PP cells and its nucleus is the cellular DNA that allows for different proteins to be made that go on to play a role in cellular functions. PP cells are able to produce pancreatic polypeptide through transcription and translation of the PPY gene. Once it is produced, pancreatic polypeptide is shown to be a 36 amino acid long peptide that can be sent out to different areas within the pancreas or organism.

Pancreatic polypeptide cells are most active and secrete more pancreatic polypeptide after a meal with high protein, fasting, physical activity, and acute hypoglycemia. These same cells are inhibited by somatostatin, an inhibitory gastrointestinal hormone, and the presence of glucose.

Through different microscopy techniques, the structural related details of PP cells have been able to be better understood. This is inclusive of how big they are, what their cellular membranes look like, the proteins associated with them, and even their size. PP cells are elongated cells. Another one of these details can be noted in insulins secretory granules, or container like buds, that store insulin within a cell. In PP cells, the size of the insulin granules are smaller and spherical and similar to those in alpha cells. This is noted in human PP cells, but different animals have been shown to have different sized granules compared to humans, like rodents. In cats and dogs, PP cells have large granules. In rats, PP cells have few granules, similar to humans. In dogs, some PP cells are located in the walls of the antrum of the stomach.
== Clinical significance ==
Pancreatic polypeptide cells are one of the most poorly understood cells in the pancreas. This is due to a number of reasons, but most notably due to its small proportion in relation to the other cells located in the pancreatic islets. Another reason that these cells are so poorly understood has to do with the difficulty in researching and analyzing these cells. Different studies conducted by various organizations and labs have all led to conflicting reports when trying to quantify PP cell populations in type 1 and type 2 diabetes due to the fact that these cells proliferate when there is damage to the pancreas.

Given that PP cells reside in the pancreas and serve both the digestive and endocrine systems, the roles it can play within a clinical setting are vast and important to analyze. Many of the applications geared around pancreatic polypeptide cells and the substances they secrete serve to better understand and treat diabetes better than it already is, and they have been heavily studied in rats. Studies are also being pursued to see how PP cells and the substances they release can help individuals who do not have a pancreas anymore due to various circumstances regulate insulin levels and maintain homeostasis. Other studies relating to PP cells have shown that these cells help to play a role in hunger for organisms. Another area of clinical research surrounding the pancreatic islets and PP cells is in regards to cellular communication. Currently, therapeutic strategies are being studied to help improve the communication between different cells in this pancreatic region by diving deeper into the cellular functions of these very cells and the regions they islet regions they reside in. The current studies being done mainly focus on diabetes and preventing the adverse effects it poses on mammalian organisms. The studies being done now focus heavily on the potential for stem-cell therapeutics or the development of different pharmaceuticals to help limit this condition.

<doc id="602553" wikidata="Q38606" url="?curid=602553" title="Tahquamenon Falls">
<text>The Tahquamenon Falls ( ) are a series of waterfalls on the Tahquamenon River, shortly before it empties into Lake Superior, in the northeastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. They are the largest waterfalls in Michigan, and one of the largest in the eastern half of North America. The water is noticeably brown in color from the tannins leached from the cedar swamps which the river drains, leading to the nickname &quot;Root Beer Falls&quot;. The falls are within Tahquamenon Falls State Park, between the towns of Newberry and Paradise, and are a popular tourist destination during all seasons.

== Geography ==
The falls are divided into the Upper and Lower Falls. The Upper Falls consist of a single drop of approximately , where the river is more than across. During the late spring runoff, the river drains as much as of water per second, making the Upper Falls the third most voluminous waterfall east of the Mississippi River, after Niagara Falls and Cohoes Falls. The Lower Falls is located about downstream, and consist of five smaller falls cascading around an island. The island can be reached by rowboat from the basin below the Lower Falls, or by a foot bridge constructed in 2022. The Upper Falls are located at , and the Lower Falls are at .

== History ==
The falls take their name from the river, which appears to come from Tahquamenon Island in Whitefish Bay, near the mouth of the river; the first written record of the name identifies the island as &quot;Outakouaminan&quot; in a 1671 French map. The Tahquamenon River is mentioned by name in Longfellow&#x27;s 1855 epic poem &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;, as the protagonist builds a birch-bark canoe &quot;In the solitary forest, By the rushing Taquamenaw&quot;. A song by Sufjan Stevens on his album &quot;Michigan&quot; is titled after Tahquamenon Falls.

<text>John Daniel Morell (18 June 1816 – 1 April 1891) was a British educationalist and Congregational minister.

==Life==
Morell was born at Little Baddow, Essex, where his father was minister of the Congregational church (1799–1852). He went to Homerton College in 1833, where he studied theology under John Pye Smith. He then entered the University of Glasgow, where he took the M.A. degree in 1841. Subsequently he studied philosophy and theology under Fichte at Bonn, and returned to England to undertake the pastorate of the Congregational church at Gosport in 1842.

In 1845, Morell gave up the ministry in favour of philosophy. In 1848 he made his name by his &quot;Historical and Critical View of the Speculative Philosophy of Europe in the Nineteenth Century&quot;. It brought him to the notice of Lord Lansdowne, who made him an inspector of schools. From 1848 till 1876 he was active in that career.

==Works==
Morell&#x27;s &quot;Historical and Critical View of the Speculative Philosophy of Europe in the Nineteenth Century&quot; was his major work. He showed a partiality for the &quot;eclectic philosophy&quot; of Victor Cousin, and pointed out the Scottish Enlightenment as a precursor. Rudolf Metz argued that Morell&#x27;s thought itself was based on Scottish philosophy.

He published educational works, including:

*&quot;The Philosophy of Religion&quot; (1849)
*&quot;The Analysis of Sentences&quot; (1852)
*&quot;Elements of Psychology&quot; (1853)
*&quot;The Essentials of English Grammar and Analysis&quot; (1855)
*&quot;Handbook of Logic&quot; (1855)
*&quot;Grammar of the English Language&quot; (1857)
*&quot;The Philosophical Tendencies of the Age&quot; (1848), four lectures
*&quot;Fichte&#x27;s Contributions to Moral Philosophy&quot; (1860)
*&quot;Philosophical Fragments&quot; (1878)
*&quot;An Introduction to Mental Philosophy on the Inductive Method&quot; (1862)
*&quot;Manual of History of Philosophy with numerous examination papers in mental science which have been set in the London University&quot; (1884).

ABC Warriors is a feature in the UK comic-book series &quot;2000 AD&quot; written by Pat Mills. It first appeared in program (issue) 119 in 1979 and continues to run as of 2018. Art for the opening episodes was by Kevin O&#x27;Neill, Mike McMahon, Brett Ewins, and Brendan McCarthy, who among them designed the original seven members of the team. Since then, they have been illustrated primarily, though not exclusively, by Bryan Talbot, Simon Bisley, SMS, Kevin Walker, Henry Flint and Clint Langley.
The A.B.C. Warriors are a team of war robots designed to withstand &#x27;Atomic&#x27;, &#x27;Bacterial&#x27; and &#x27;Chemical&#x27; warfare. They were built to take part in the long-running Volgan War, which Mills had described in several previous &quot;2000 AD&quot; strips, including &quot;Invasion!&quot; and &quot;Ro-Busters&quot;. Each robot has a distinctive personality – often one programmed by its human creators – but each is more or less able to act with free will.

==Overview==

One of the main characters, Hammerstein, was already known to &quot;2000 AD&quot; readers through the story &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; (originally started in the magazine &quot;Starlord&quot;). The story of the creation of robotic warriors to be used in the Volgan War had been introduced in the Ro-Busters story &quot;Hammerstein&#x27;s War Memoirs.&quot; Hammerstein is the only ABC Warrior to appear on film, making a cameo appearance in the 1995 Judge Dredd movie.

The initial run of stories from progs 119–128 follows Hammerstein towards the end of the Volgan War as he recruits six robots to join him for a special mission – to tame Mars, which had become a futuristic Wild West. In further adventures set much later in time, the warriors teamed up with Nemesis the Warlock in his fight against the Termight Empire to prevent a destabilized Black Hole bypass at the Earth&#x27;s core from destroying the world.

Many of these early stories pursue the theme of humans using robots to do jobs that they do not wish to do themselves (following the same theme as Ro-Busters) and the cruel treatment of soldier robots by their human officers. The Warriors often find themselves at odds with humans who are exploiting the land and the beings that live on it – typical storylines see the Warriors identifying such evil and delivering poetic justice to the perpetrators. Later stories also explore ideas of &quot;khaos&quot; and the concept of programmed robots being able to discover their true identities.

Artists who illustrated &quot;ABC Warriors&quot; include Kevin O&#x27;Neill, Mike McMahon, Brett Ewins, Brendan McCarthy, Carlos Ezquerra, Dave Gibbons, Simon Bisley, Kev Walker, and Henry Flint.

==Characters==
The members of the Warriors have changed over the course of the stories they have been featured in. Here are the longest-serving members:

===Hammerstein===

Hammerstein has been the leader of the Warriors for most of the comic&#x27;s run, although he has surrendered the position to Deadlock for a number of stories. He was the first successful war robot to be built, and this success was due to his being given both emotions and a conscience, which allowed him to distinguish between combatants and civilians.

In the first run of &quot;ABC Warriors&quot; stories, he was recruited during the Volgan Wars by the mysterious Colonel Lash to lead the ABC Warriors on Lash&#x27;s post war project. Overall humanoid in form, his right &quot;hand&quot; is the combat hammer that gives him his name. Depicted as noble, brave, and patriotic, he has always represented the compassionate &quot;heart&quot; of the team while remaining a formidable warrior.

===Deadlock===
Deadlock is a follower of the Khaos religion, and as such is frequently at odds with the order and duty-obsessed Hammerstein, which eventually led him to betray and attempt to kill Hammerstein in the story The Black Hole. Deadlock&#x27;s powers allow him to astrally project and reform his body if it is damaged or destroyed, and he holds the sword X-Caliber, a weapon that allows him to drain the souls of the living to use as psychic &quot;nourishment&quot;. He is able to call demons and the undead to his aid. For a time, Deadlock led the team in place of Hammerstein, the only other member ever to do so.

When first shown, Deadlock was the Grand Wizard of the Knights Martial, a group of highly intelligent robots who had developed psychic and magical abilities and observed the war from the &quot;Watch Tower&quot; space station. They were given special authority to try and execute Volgan war criminals during the conflict, as well as war criminals from their own side. Deadlock occasionally led his Knights into active combat, such as to take down and reprogram the Volgan robot general Volkhan so he could no longer create robots outside of human control.

The Watch Tower was brought to earth by Volgan artillery during the war, just before Hammerstein recruited Deadlock for the Mars mission. On his eventual return, Deadlock discovered that in his absence the Knights – no longer kept chaste and pure by isolation far above the earth&#x27;s surface – had been tainted and turned to frivolous pursuits, ignoring the old values of meditation, purity, and discipline. A disgusted Deadlock turned his back on the order and went into isolation, meditating and studying ancient manuscripts in an attempt to reach the highest level of the astral plane, and join with his master Khaos. When he was ready, it was Nemesis himself who came for him, and they became one, as shown in &quot;Nemesis the Warlock Book Four: The Gothic Empire&quot;.

Centuries passed with no word of his whereabouts, though at some point he established a Kollege of Khaos on the comet Tiamat. He finally reappeared in the bowels of Terra to assist older versions of his former comrades, sent back from the future Termight by Nemesis the Warlock, to save the planet from destruction – a mission depicted in the story &quot;The Black Hole&quot;. Although his motives were unclear at first, he assisted the Warriors in their battles with the Monad, a creature from the end of time, only to betray them when they finally reached their goal. It turned out he had been sent by his master Khaos to ensure the destruction of Termight so Khaos might spread throughout the galaxy. With the assistance of Blackblood and Mek-Quake, Deadlock launched a fearsome attack on his comrades in a bid to stop them from repairing the damage done to the Time Wastes; he was forced to betray his master and save Termight so the Monad would not use the planet&#x27;s destruction to turn Khaos into an evil force.

Escaping the Time Wastes, Deadlock assumed leadership of The Warriors and led them to Nemesis&#x27; home planet, Gandarva, to settle a score. The repair of the Time Wastes had restored Order to the galaxy and thus Deadlock and Nemesis had both betrayed Khaos. The two of them fought literally to the death, only to be reborn, purged of their guilt. Deadlock then took the Warriors to the planet Hekate, inducting them (both willingly and forcibly) into the ways of Khaos; he led them in collecting the heads of seven symbols of order, which could be used in a ritual to spread Khaos throughout the galaxy. After succeeding, the other Warriors defied his command, demonstrating their status as true Khaos warriors.

Following this, he returned to his Kollege with Ro-Jaws, who understood the twisting tides of Khaos even better than he did. They worked to indoctrinate students into the ways of Khaos – often via the bar – while also hunting down teachers throughout the galaxy and flying back to the Kollege to be endlessly tortured. Ten years after the Hekate mission, he led the Warriors&#x27; reformation to combat the Terran weapon Hellbringer.

Subsequently, they returned to Mars under the command of Hammerstein, where Deadlock was instrumental in bringing about an end to the war between the human colonists and the planetary consciousness, Medusa. Deadlock helped broker a peace and he stayed on to help the Warriors in the resulting Martian civil war. It was Deadlock who discovered that the Confederacy of Martian Industries was assembling the mercenary Shadow Warriors team to destroy the Warriors, who learned the identities of its members and whose khaos rituals turned the tide in the final battle against them.

===Joe Pineapples===
Joe Pineapples is the closest thing Hammerstein has to a friend, being his longest-serving comrade. Joe was built as an assassin, is a former member of the elite X-Terminators (he was fired for an unspecified incident involving a human officer&#x27;s wife), and is a sniper without equal. Joe has rebuilt himself many times to give himself new looks over the years, but one thing that has been consistent is his narcissism – the one thing he truly loves in the universe is himself. With an outward image of ice cold professionalism and a habit of seducing women, he has a secret fetish for wearing women&#x27;s underwear.

The first run of &quot;ABC Warriors&quot; stories showed Joe&#x27;s talents taking him into Volgograd to assassinate Volgan general Volkhan, and afterwards assigning him to the Mars mission; he forcibly recruited General Blackblood by shooting the butcher through the heart, beginning a long-standing feud between the two. After Mars, Pineapples wound up working as a police instructor in London and once had to neutralise a rampaging Hammerstein who thought he was still fighting the Volgan War. Joe&#x27;s career with various police forces continued in some form for centuries, and by the time Earth had become Termight he was on the free robot planet of Mekka working as an undercover officer. At some point he developed a hatred of humans (&quot;meatheads&quot;) and was eventually put on the black list for pursuing human criminals with too much zeal. Pineapples also began taking up transvestism, apparently jaded from rebuilding himself time and time again and wanting to experience something new. Blackblood was able to obtain photo negatives of this.

At the request of Nemesis, the Warlock, Joe left the police to rejoin the ABC Warriors in the battle to defend the Gothic Empire. Following the battle against Termight, the Warriors followed Nemesis into the Time Wastes of Termight to find the Warlock&#x27;s offspring Thoth and repair the damage Thoth was doing to time itself, and save the galaxy. When Deadlock tried to sabotage the mission, Blackblood and Joe fought each other. For Pineapples it was a chance to get the negatives back, and for Blackblood it was a chance to finally discover what Joe had been hiding in his chest locker for the entire journey. As it turned out, the mystery item was a human heart: Joe was carrying it in a desperate bid to feel, so he could enjoy killing again.

After escaping to the planet Hekate, Pineapples helped collect the seven heads needed for the ritual that would spread Khaos through the galaxy, but suffered a breakdown as the &#x27;Night of the Blood Moon&#x27; approached. Deadlock took it upon himself to perform an unnecessary operation on Joe, to give him a much more Khaotic outlook on life – and unlock his repressed desires for more exotic crossdressing. After Hekate, the Warriors went their separate ways, and Pineapples, sick of being on the dole for Khaos, signed up with the Terran Empire as a professional hit droid. As a result of his wealth and status, he was forced to join the Warriors when they banded together to take on the Terran supership Hellbringer.

He joined the Warriors in returning to Mars to help increase the peace between Medusa, the planetary consciousness, and her human settlers. When civil war broke out in the aftermath and the mercenary Shadow Warriors were sent after them, Joe developed a severe rivalry with mercenary and highwayman Dog-Tag, sparked when Joe foiled one of Dog-Tag&#x27;s heists, wiped out his gang and caused severe damage to him. Dog-Tag got revenge when he shot Joe through the head, buried him and removed his trigger finger. Due to techniques learned from Deadlock, Joe survived the attack – having shut down his brain to near-death levels – and was able to kill his rival.

===Blackblood===
Blackblood is a former Volgan war robot who was forcibly recruited into the Warriors. A master tactician and interrogator, his skills also extend to treachery and betrayal, two things at which he is highly adept. He dislikes Hammerstein intensely, but this is nothing compared to his hatred of Joe Pineapples – the robot responsible for his capture. His constant undermining of Hammerstein&#x27;s leadership has led to many confrontations between the two, and a healthy disrespect that has spanned the centuries. He is currently a member of the Church of Judas, a religion for robots who have betrayed their masters and pray to Judas to take away the guilt.

The 2011 &quot;Savage&quot; story &quot;Secret City&quot; would retcon that Blackblood was originally a whole &quot;series&quot; of Volgan robots, a counterpart to the Allied Hammersteins. The Blackblood Mark Ones came online in 2009 and were only crudely sentient; they were programmed to dismember and behead their enemies, to ensure Allied robots would be fully disabled (and without any &quot;re&quot;programming when they were sent against humans), and with no ability to distinguish friend from foe. Bill Savage discovered their field trials in the Midlands&#x27; Zone of Alienation.

Decades later, the Volgan scientist Dr Zakaroff sought to create a robot warrior capable of treachery but initially failed to do so with Blackblood. In desperation, Zakaroff turned to the occult, and used a mixture of black magic and science to harness the betrayal of two lovers, whom he forced to torture each other. Blackblood went on to prove his newly discovered treachery by killing Zakaroff, having one of his eyes shot out in the process. He left the socket empty as a reminder of his greatest act of betrayal.

During the Volgan War he led the Straw Dogs, experts in jungle warfare and terror tactics, and was rumoured to drink the oil of dead ABC Warriors. He was also responsible for trying to stop Joe Pineapples and Zippo after a failed hit on General Volkhan, causing the remote self-destruction of hundreds of foreign robots in the attempt. He would also root out internal enemies, such as robot designers Mikhail and Marina Zhigunov; he viciously tortured one of their subordinates to uncover the truth, shot the Zhigunovs dead, and attempted to kill their daughter Lara before being temporarily deactivated by partisans. Later on, assisting Volklhan, he used Zhigunov&#x27;s virus to infect Steelhorn and cause the Warrior to begin murdering civilians and allies. He also developed an obsession with discovering the secret enemy officer &quot;General Public&quot;, due to a misunderstanding.

Realising his skills in guerrilla warfare would be a valuable asset, Colonel Lash ordered Hammerstein to hunt down Blackblood and forcibly recruit him; Joe Pineapples took him down by shooting him through the heart, and his worst excesses were then removed by brain surgery. He was then sent on the Mars mission.

After Mars, little is known of Blackblood&#x27;s activities. He eventually turned up on the free robot planet of Mekka, where he plied a trade as a &quot;business man&quot; under the name Bunyon Snipe, selling addictive software to robots; he married an exotic dancer, Ruby Yum Yum Gluck, and still drank the oil of other robots. He also came into possession of certain negatives about Joe Pineapples at a party and was using them for blackmail purposes. He would eventually be forcibly recruited by Nemesis the Warlock into the newly reformed ABC Warriors, fighting against the Terminators before heading into the Time Wastes.

He and the other Warriors went on to repair the damage done to the Time Wastes&#x27; Black Hole Control Room and save Terra from destruction. During the mission, Blackblood yet again proved that his treachery knew no bounds as he betrayed the Warriors to the Eternal Soldiers of Agartha, and then assisted Deadlock in a sabotage attempt to stop the Warriors from completing their task. It was during this foray into the Time Wastes that Blackblood lost his leg; he killed a road crew and took their road drill as a substitute. Following this, he and the rest of the Warriors briefly helped Deadlock attempt to spread Khaos throughout the galaxy; Blackblood loved this job due to the bloodshed involved, and the influence of Khaos on the Warriors allowed him to be more murderous and sadistic.

Leaving the Warriors again after tiring of Deadlock&#x27;s command (due to the Khaos influence), Blackblood set up an arms dealership and even took on a pet dog while torturing a trapped Hammerstein for five years (he happily sent photos of it to every other Warrior). When Hammerstein got free and reformed the Warriors again, Blackblood was forced to sign up under threat of death.

He returned to Mars to help keep the peace between the human colonists and the planetary consciousness, Medusa – though he stated he had his own reasons for doing so, which were soon to become apparent. In the battle against the Shadow Warriors (whom he respected for their brutality), Blackblood faced off against the Rev, head of the Church of Judas, and killed him in a vicious battle. Most recently, he permanently alienated Mongrol after it was revealed that he tried to kill his beloved Lara during the war. Even this paled to nothing when he informed an institutionalised Mek-Quake that the ABCs were permanently replacing him, leading to the embittered bulldozer engineering a jailbreak for the Volgan war criminal Volkhan, incarcerated at the same asylum. Blackblood defected from the team at a crucial point in their attempt to rescue Zippo in Marineris City, joining Volkhan&#x27;s rebellion as his right-hand man. Volkhan and Blackblood escaped and went into hiding after their attempt to destroy the ABC Warriors failed, but with his true colours now firmly revealed, it&#x27;s a certainty that they are only biding their time until the next attempt.

===Mongrol===
The immensely strong Mongrol was originally the commander of an ABC paratrooper platoon, and the only survivor (save Zippo) of the disastrous drop into Volgan territory at Vilnius – so disastrous that it was nicknamed Zarnhem after Arnhem. Only his head remained undamaged and remained on the battlefield. A scavenger named Lara, the daughter of executed robot manufacturers, salvaged his head and built him a new body with other robot parts as an act of defiance against the Volgans. She was caught and executed, and Mongrol was tortured by electricity for information – this inadvertently activated his body, and he broke free of his captors.

The torture and Lara&#x27;s death reduced him to near animal-like behaviour (&quot;Mongrol smush!&quot;), and he was regarded as a threat by both sides. He was recruited when Hammerstein earned his respect by beating him in hand-to-hand combat. Mongrol&#x27;s belief that he would go to heaven and meet his beloved Lara once more became the driving force of the metal ape. After being told by Deadlock that only good robots go to heaven, he became determined to live a hero&#x27;s life and see his beloved again.

After the Mars mission, he found work with P.T. Bar-Num&#x27;s &quot;Death Circus&quot; on the free robot planet Mekka. He played the part of The Gawk, a giant metal monster that would be defeated by the heroic Spar-Tekus in every show. He&#x27;d been playing that role for so long that he&#x27;d forgotten who he was. He was found by Nemesis the Warlock and brought back into the ranks of The ABC Warriors to help save the Gothic Empire from a Terminator invasion. He was then dispatched with the other Warriors into the Time Wastes of Termight to repair the damage done to it. During their journey, Blackblood broke the news to Mongrol that robots simply go to the smelter rather than heaven, so he would never see Lara again. As a result, Mongrol turned to his &#x27;father&#x27; – a screwdriver.

After saving Terra from destruction, Mongrol followed the others to the planet Hekate, to collect the seven heads needed for the ritual that would spread Khaos throughout the Terran Empire. Mongrol was stripped of his ability to speak, but he was given the quick reactions and speed of a naturally born beast as compensation. After completing their mission on Hekate, Mongrol left for the Temple of the Night Maras with Morrigun, and became nothing more than her mindless (and overly protective) pet. Both he and his &quot;mistress&quot; joined The ABC Warriors again to take on the Terran superweapon Hellbringer.

On the return to Mars, Mongrol&#x27;s body was destroyed, forcing him to relocate his positronic brain into his new body. This reactivated long-dormant circuits, restoring his original intelligence (as well as a taste for cigars). He is still suffering from deep-seated issues over Lara, and when her memory was mocked by the Shadow Warrior Warmonger, Mongrol ripped him to pieces.

Following Blackblood&#x27;s recounting of his Volgan War experiences and the revelation that he tried to kill Lara, Mongrol went berserk and stated that, at the end of that mission, either Blackblood leaves the Warriors, or he will. However, Blackblood had already set things up so Mek-Quake would free Volkhan from Broadband Asylum, and he would go on to abandon the ABC Warriors mid-battle and rejoin Volkhan&#x27;s army, gleefully slaughtering civilians once more and trying to kill the ABC Warriors. He is currently at large, an enemy of the Warriors once more.

===Steelhorn / The Mess===

An elite droid built from indestructible alloys, Steelhorn was proclaimed a hero to the West and seen as one by Volgan civilians whom he liberated, even possessing a secret underground base. Due to his Vortex Hammer weapon, the Volgans viewed him as a war criminal, and so Volkhan and Blackblood infected him with a computer virus that caused him to start massacring civilians and fellow Warriors. Zippo eventually stopped Steelhorn and the virus was deleted, and the massacres were covered up by the military – but he was left traumatised and disillusioned by what he&#x27;d done.

Steelhorn eventually ended the Volgan War by killing the Volgan Marshall. Following the war, he went to a demobilisation camp to be reprogrammed for civilian life, believing he would become a firefighter and save lives, only to find himself falling into a fusion furnace—which was now being used to kill the ABC Warriors now that victory had been won. With his dying breaths, Steelhorn cursed humans for their treachery.

He survived the furnace, but his body was reduced to a bubbling mess. Consumed with hatred, the Mess slaughtered the human responsible before escaping. Hammerstein, realising it was actually Steelhorn, saved the Mess and had him poured into a vacuum flask that would be carried by Mongrol. The metal ape was the only one who could understand what the Mess was trying to say. The shambles would accompany the Mars mission.

On Mars, the Warriors encountered a giant robot called George, one of the original Garganteks – giant robots who had originally helped terraform Mars for human colonisation. Because of his size, each of George&#x27;s limbs was controlled by a separate brain, with a master brain supposedly in charge. The Mess ended up inside George, using its liquid state to connect George&#x27;s brains and turn him into a fearsome fighting machine. When the Mars mission was complete, George and the Mess remained behind after the Mars mission was completed.

Centuries later, continued terraforming awoke Medusa, the planetary consciousness, and caused her to try to wipe out humanity. She destroyed George for the crime of terraforming her and discovered the Mess as a result; finding it shared her hatred of humans, she rebuilt it into a new incarnation of Steelhorn. He now possessed certain psychic powers allowing him to control Martian wildlife. He became Medusa&#x27;s voice, organising the attacks on the human settlements and personally leading the slaughter at Viking City, which saw almost the entire population massacred by a Martian born virus. The ABC Warriors fought the new Steelhorn and eventually struck a deal with him and Medusa, agreeing to peaceful coexistence if human President Cobb was transformed into a Martian.

Steelhorn re-joined the ranks of The ABC Warriors in place of the deceased Morrigun, in a bid to increase peace on Mars after Cobb&#x27;s transformation sparked a civil war. While travelling with them to New Sidona to fend off Confederacy soldiers, Steelhorn was taken out by the rival Shadow Warriors, melted to a sludge once more. Due to occult activities by Deadlock, he was reborn in a diamond form and brought about the ABC Warriors&#x27; victory.

He has two horns, one of which when played incites wildlife to rebel. He has not said what the other will do, but it is to be played in the event of a Confederate victory and the consequences would presumably be devastating.

===Mek-Quake===
Mek-Quake is a dim-witted and sadistic former demolition droid. Serving mainly as comic relief, he was originally a member of the Ro-Busters, used for internal discipline within the rescue squad (mainly by destroying troublemakers), and did not join the Warriors until their later phase. In the 2010 &quot;Savage Book VI: Crims&quot; story, Mek-Quake makes a cameo appearance destroying compromised Hammersteins in 2009 (which makes him both the oldest warrior and the oldest AI robot).

His original body was that of a very large bulldozer, as seen throughout the run of Ro-Busters. When he reappeared in Book III of &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot;, fighting for the evil Termight empire, his (tiny) brain was now housed in a colossal siege robot with a head vaguely resembling a cat&#x27;s. Despite his enormous destructive power, his stupidity ultimately ended up making the situation even worse for the Terminators. In Book IV of &quot;Nemesis&quot;, he returned to his original body; he later switched between this, and a vaguely humanoid body stolen from a defeated opponent, depending on the requirements of each mission.

Despite initially fighting against them, Mek-Quake was recruited to the Warriors by Nemesis, who realised that his insatiable appetite for mayhem and near-indestructibility made him a useful asset – as well as the fact that his limited intelligence and considerable survival instinct meant he had no loyalties except to whichever side would give him the most opportunity to destroy things.

For &quot;Black Hole&quot;, Mek-Quake&#x27;s bulldozer body was redesigned as a heavily armed &quot;killdozer&quot;, with a prehensile neck and a &quot;face&quot; with a permanent angry scowl. The killdozer body was blown up in &#x27;The Clone Cowboys&#x27;, leaving him in humanoid form. This – the current – version of Mek-Quake has ranged in height from five to fifteen feet, depending on the artist, though he is generally depicted as the largest of the Warriors.

What Mek-Quake lacks in intelligence (which is a lot) he makes up for in cruelty and destructive force. However, he is also something of a coward, preferring softer targets that he can inflict more pain upon while chanting his catchphrase: &quot;Big jobs!&quot; He has no compunctions about massacring humans, as evidenced in &quot;The Third Element&quot; when he is annoyed about having missed most of a battle because of the time it took to remove all the &quot;human gristle&quot; clogging his caterpillar tracks. In his early stories he openly loathed Hammerstein and Ro-Jaws (as a result of their time in Ro-Busters), but later this hatred was toned down to a general dislike of everything and everybody except videos of chainsaw torture. Despite this Mek-Quake is eager to show his intelligence and importance, and in &quot;Kronicles of Khaos&quot; he kept trying to join in at the end of Deadlock&#x27;s statements so he could seem like he was already versed in Khaos.

He continued to be part of the Warriors in their return to Mars as they tried to keep the peace during a civil war, developing an interest in conspiracy theories and rap music, but it was clear that his increasing mental instability was putting the rest of the team in danger. After the defeat of the Shadow Warriors, Mek-Quake was checked into a robot asylum by the others. While Hammerstein seemed sad to see his former enemy depart, the others appeared more than eager to meet his replacement, Zippo. Mek-Quake was assigned to clean the cell of former Volgan General Volkhan – but when Blackblood called up to gleefully tell him he was going to be replaced, an embittered Mek-Quake freed Volkhan and his associates and helped kill the asylum staff. He then joined with Volkhan and Blackblood in an attempt to destroy the rest of the ABC Warriors, as well as Marineris City. When the rebellion failed and he was abandoned to his fate by Volkhan&#x27;s troops, Mek-Quake managed to escape destruction with Steelhorn&#x27;s fusion hammer and unwittingly found himself a celebrity in the Union of Martian Free States for the destruction of the Marinus Red House. After promoting his book tour, Mek-Quake has found employment as Howard Quartz&#x27;s bodyguard, and was most recently responsible for murdering Tubal Caine&#x27;s adopted son.

===Ro-Jaws===

Ro-Jaws was involved in a number of the ABCs adventures, acting largely as comic relief. A working-class sewer droid with filthy habits and a love of refuse, he was originally a law-abiding robot until he was thrown in jail for taking a sick homeless man into a Cabinet minister&#x27;s house (believing the minister to be a friend). The abuses in robot prison, as well as mixing with criminal robots, caused Ro-Jaws to develop a crude, disrespectful and anarchic attitude, gaining him an interest in robot rebellion. (He assisted robot resistance agents but was considered too silly-looking) He was briefly owned by a rich family as a companion for their daughter Annabel; the two became great friends, and it is unknown how that ended. It is known from the first &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; that he hit his master (unknown if this was Annabel&#x27;s father), putting him in the hospital, and that is why he was thrown away.

He first met Hammerstein when they were both &quot;Second Hand Bargains&quot; at a robot shop, and the two were bought by the Ro-Busters disaster agency. The two clashed repeatedly due to their differing personalities but would develop a strong sense of friendship. In one incident, they went undercover to investigate murders on a space station, and Ro-Jaws discovered it was the work of robots who were planning a rebellion; Ro-Jaws found the uprising was being secretly directed by humans, and noted he&#x27;d have &quot;joined&quot; the uprising if it had been run by robots. Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein were eventually forced to go on the run when they were nearly killed for the insurance money, and helped a number of robots escape Earth to the robot free world Saturn Six; they threw away the chance to make it to Saturn Six themselves by staying behind to cover the escape. They then went underground with new identity papers, singing together as they went off, they&#x27;d always be &quot;walking along side by side&quot;.

Many centuries in the future, Ro-Jaws was working in a hotel in the Gothic Empire and ended up as a valet for Nemesis the Warlock. Ro-Jaws swiftly became a trusted aide and was reunited with Hammerstein in the process, encouraging Nemesis to save his old friend from execution. His brief turn as an official ABC warrior occurred when Nemesis despatched the warriors into the Time Wastes to repair the damage done by his son Thoth; when Terri was inducted into the warriors early into the subsequent Black Hole mission, Ro-Jaws cheerfully gave up this position, although he continued to be a hanger-on for some time. He remained for the Hekate mission and quickly got to grips with Khaos. Following the mission, he left the team with Deadlock to work at the Kollege of Khaos; Deadlock considers Ro-Jaws to understand the nature of Khaos even better than he does.

Despite their polar opposite personalities, he regards Hammerstein as a good friend and has saved the soldier&#x27;s life several times. In a flashback to the Ro-Busters days, it was him who ensured a temporarily rampaging Hammerstein was taken down non-lethally before Mek-Quake reached and killed him; he worked to convince Nemesis to prevent his execution in &quot;The Gothic Empire&quot;; and in &quot;Khronicles of Khaos&quot; he asked Deadlock if he could turn Hammerstein into a more Khaotic person, believing it would be beneficial to him. However, in a contradictory moment in &quot;Hellbringer&quot;, Ro-Jaws (like everyone else) was shown to have known Hammerstein was being tortured by Blackblood but had no interest in helping him.

In 2010, he returned in &quot;The Volgan War Book 4&quot;, &quot;where it was&quot; revealed that he had been hiding out on Mars (as a public toilet cleaner) under the alias &quot;U-Fox&quot; and helping Zippo in his resistance activities. As U-Fox, he&#x27;d racked up a reputation as an outlaw graffiti artist. He assisted the Warriors against Volkhan and his armies, distracting Mek-Quake with a series of &quot;your mother&quot; jokes and leading the bulldozer away from the larger battle. Afterwards, he remained in Marineris City.

Ro-Jaws also served as the &quot;host&quot; for a series of short one-off strips, under the title &quot;Ro-Jaws Robot Tales&quot;. In 2006, he was a central figure in a tribute poster to deceased letterer Tom Frame, sharing a drink with the robot representing Frame. Taken together, the names &quot;Ro-Jaws and Hammerstein&quot; serve as a pun on the famous Broadway musical-writing team of Rodgers and Hammerstein.

===Other members===

Up until Blackblood&#x27;s defection in 2010, there had always been a &quot;core five&quot; in the ABC Warriors – Hammerstein, Joe, Deadlock, Blackblood. and Mongrol – that remained unchanged, except for the ten years or so when Nemesis the Warlock took the place of Deadlock. Various other characters have occupied the sixth and seventh positions as they became vacant. The two other original members were Steelhorn and Happy Shrapnel; they are also the only ex-members to return, though both in radically different forms. Except for Ro-Jaws and Mek-Quake, every other former member was killed in action.

====Happy Shrapnel/Tubal Caine====

A crusty and cantankerous veteran with a malfunctioning voicebox that punctuated his sentences with buzzes, Happy was originally a &quot;combat test dummy&quot; made a little unhinged by the numerous battlefield tests he had been put through. He wielded Kolt 45s stolen from a dead Volgan general and wore clothing taken from dead humans – sometimes with parts of the corpses still in them. Killed &quot;off-camera&quot; in a bar brawl soon after the end of the Warrior&#x27;s original mission and buried by the others on Mars, it was his death that prompted the others to first go their separate ways.

Decades later, he was also the reason that the team returned, when they received electronic signals telling them that he was still alive and that the evils they had rid Mars of were returning. The Warriors helped Happy rebuild himself, but he refused to rejoin them. Renaming himself &quot;Tubal Caine&quot;, the former Happy reluctantly agreed to be the Warrior&#x27;s armourer, refitting and repairing them after their many battles on Mars. He remained neutral until Blackblood defected to Volkhan&#x27;s army, whereupon the other Warriors asked him once more to join them. Tubal revealed that in his time as a blacksmith, he adopted a child named Tom, who had fallen out with his Humpy brethren after choosing to ignore their outdated beliefs. Tubal was later approached by Howard Quartz with Mek-Quake in tow, demanding that he terminate Volkhan. Refusing to serve Quartz, Quartz activated the ruined robots in Caine&#x27;s scrapyard, causing them to attack. Despite sustaining severe injuries, Tubal fought off the machines, but was instead attacked by Mek-Quake, who severed his head.

Tom Caine opened fire on Mek-Quake, but his weapon malfunctioned, leaving Mek-Quake open to murder him. The shock of seeing his son murdered and suffering severe damage caused Tubal&#x27;s system to crash, as Quartz had intended. When he re-activated and re-attached his head, Tubal was restored to default status, becoming Happy Shrapnel again, and no longer a pacifist. Hearing his story, the warriors joined Happy and helped him seek vengeance against Quartz.

====Hitaki====

Programmed to act like an ancient samurai by a Japanese secret society, Hitaki was a comrade of Hammerstein and Mad Ronn in the Terminators. After being thwarted in a suicide mission against the Goth Queen by Nemesis, he was inducted into the newly reformed ABC Warriors. He was beheaded by the Monad at the end of the world; Mek-Quake then crushed his body beyond repair before he could be fixed, killing him.

====Mad Ronn====

A bomb-disposal robot during the Volgan Wars, he possessed highly sensitive electronic sensors. He was a Terminator alongside Hammerstein and Hitaki and was sent on the suicide mission against the Gothic Empire, then joined the new ABC Warriors. Ronn died while trying to defuse a Terminator bomb before it killed alien refugees.

====Terri====

One of the organic slaves (a &quot;Terr-1&quot;) of the Mekaniks, the single-minded robot guardians of the Black Hole and the Tomb of Emperor Zallin, she grew up believing herself to be a robot, albeit a low-caste one due to being made of flesh. She has attempted to make her mind &amp; body just like her masters, possessing incredible strength and the ability to absorb pain unflinchingly, and she believes in logic and recycling. When the Mekaniks murdered her infant son, she turned on them, believing this proved them illogical.

She was made the seventh ABC Warrior by Deadlock and developed a strong romantic relationship with Hammerstein, whom she believed was the father of her child. The two of them planned to settle down and retire after the Black Hole mission, but she was killed during the battle against the Monad.

====Morrigun====

Originally a bar waitress on Hekate before she was drafted, she was an expert at the martial art Nekra Chi and wielded both Moon Flails and Pentangs – metal throwing stars powered by Khaos. As a field test, she personally retrieved one of the seven heads for the Khaos ritual. During the mission, she took Mongrol as a pet and left with him afterwards to study with the Khaos priestesses called the Night Maras. She rejoined the Warriors for the Hellbringer mission.

She was killed on Mars while trying to save the native Trimorphs from a pogrom, being crushed beyond repair by a tank.

====Zippo====

Zippo AKA Agent Orange is a flamethrower unit (&quot;a Zippo&quot;) that formerly served in special forces against the Volgans and reported directly to Colonel Lash. His agenda during the war was enigmatic; sometimes it was to assist the ABC Warriors, whereas in the &quot;Zarnhem&quot; massacre (a battle deliberately lost by Western officers for propaganda purposes) it was to ensure there were no survivors. He has a habit of inscribing mottoes and messages on the weapons and cigarette lighters of his comrades. He has history with all of the surviving original ABC Warriors, and has inscribed messages on most of their weapons.

After the war, he eventually ended up in Marineris City (&quot;Mekana&quot;) on Mars. Friends of his were killed in anti-robot riots. He ended up becoming an outlaw, mentored as a graffiti artist by the insane &quot;tagger&quot; Kroll; he left messages and occasionally took out police officers to eventually provoke an uprising. He was eventually captured by the G-Men, a specialist police unit, while his mentor Kroll was killed. The ABC Warriors rescued him from execution and gave him Mek-Quake&#x27;s recently vacated place in the team.

===Members as of 2014===
As of 2014, the current ABC Warriors are Hammerstein, Deadlock, Joe Pineapples, Mongrol, Steelhorn, Zippo and Tubal Caine.

==Stories==
===The Mek-nificent Seven===
The ABC Warriors (story untitled, 1 episode, art by Kevin O&#x27;Neill)

Introduces Joe Pineapples and Happy Shrapnel. Hammerstein first comes to the attention of the mysterious Colonel Lash.

Retreat From Volgow (1 episode, Brendan McCarthy)

Colonel Lash arranges a &#x27;test&#x27; for Hammerstein – withdrawing tank support when the Volgans reactivate a unit of robots so brutal they were deactivated by their own side for fear of the damage they could cause. Hammerstein defeats and kills &#x27;Old Horney&#x27;, the first Volgan war robot and so his counterpart to. Lash then reveals part of his mission: he wants Hammerstein and his unit to recruit a number of other robots for a classified mission, beginning with the fearsome Mongrol.

Mongrol (2 episodes, Mike McMahon)

Hammerstein, Joe and Happy track down the renegade robot Mongrol. Hammerstein realises the only thing Mongrol respects is strength – he has to defeat him in combat. This proves easier said than done, but when Volgan forces attack, Mongrol&#x27;s thirst for revenge against those who killed Lara, his creator, overpowers his urge to fight Hammerstein. The two join forces to defeat the attackers, and the simple-minded behemoth pledges to follow his new master.

The Order of the Knights Martial (2 episodes, Kevin O&#x27;Neill and Brett Ewins)

Hammerstein&#x27;s next recruit is Deadlock, Grand Wizard of the Knights Martial. Deadlock has foreseen why Hammerstein has come – if he can defeat Deadlock in combat, he will join him – but if he fails, Deadlock will claim his life. Despite Deadlock&#x27;s psychic powers and black magic, Hammerstein wins the duel, and Deadlock reluctantly agrees to join the ABC Warriors.

The Bougainville Massacre (2 episodes, Mike McMahon)

The Warriors take on the Straw Dog soldiers of ruthless Volgan war robot General Blackblood, crippling their leader&#x27;s war machine before he can escape. However, Blackblood has taken a child hostage, forcing Joe Pineapples to take the most difficult shot of his career to date: he has to hit Blackblood&#x27;s &#x27;heart&#x27; precisely while not harming the boy. Joe is successful, and Blackblood is captured, a disgusted Hammerstein left wondering what mission could be so important that a butcher like Blackblood has to become part of his team.

Steelhorn (2 episodes, Brendan McCarthy)

The Volgan War is over, the robot Steelhorn – made from almost indestructible materials – having killed the enemy leader, Marshal Volgow. However, when Steelhorn reports for decommissioning, he is betrayed by his own side. With the war over, the robot soldiers are no longer needed, and Steelhorn is dropped into a fusion furnace that even he cannot withstand. Instead of vaporising, he becomes &#x27;The Mess&#x27; – an intelligence made from molten metal that is consumed with the desire for revenge against his betrayers. The Mess is stored in a flask (kept by Mongrol) that lets it stay molten, and the seventh ABC Warrior has been recruited, albeit in an unusual form.

Mars, The Devil Planet (1 episode, Mike McMahon)

Colonel Lash reveals the Warriors&#x27; secret mission – to travel to the colonised and terraformed planet Mars, where rival corporations are at war over resources, the civilians caught in the middle. They are to bring peace to the planet, by any means necessary.

Cyboons (2 episodes, Dave Gibbons)

Soya ranchers are driving the Cyboons – intelligent genetically altered apes used in the early days of terraforming – off their reservation to take over the land. The Warriors try to offer the apes assistance, but their leader Bedlam refuses their help. But when Bedlam&#x27;s son is murdered by the ranchers, he leads his tribe into an attack. Since the ranchers are armed, it seems like a slaughter – but Deadlock and Blackblood had secretly infiltrated the ranchers&#x27; camp, disarming their guns. Without their weapons, the ranchers are helpless against the ferocity of the Cyboon attack, and after suffering heavy losses are quick to surrender and leave the Cyboons in peace.

The Red Death (2 episodes, Mike McMahon)

Called to deal with a ruthless biker gang terrorising Viking City, the Warriors seem to have an easy victory – until the frightened, fleeing bikers die almost instantly from a hideous flesh-rotting disease. The disease is native to Mars, and triggered by fear. Tracking the disease to its source, the Warriors find a young boy near a car containing the rotting corpses of his parents. Hammerstein is afraid that the boy will see their bodies, become frightened and die himself – and the disease begins to affect even his metal body. Deadlock reveals that the &#x27;boy&#x27; actually is a manifestation of the Red Death, Mars itself trying to drive away the human settlers. Hammerstein kills the fake child, and the menace is over – for now.

Golgotha (3 episodes, Carlos Ezquerra)

A popular pastime among the ultra-rich youth of Mars is hunting – but instead of animals, they hunt people, while riding on the backs of genetically recreated Tyrannosaurs. The most feared of the dinosaurs is Golgotha, son of Satanus (the monstrous T-Rex that appeared during the &#x27;Cursed Earth&#x27; storyline of Judge Dredd, who himself was the son of &#x27;Old One Eye&#x27; from another 2000AD series, Flesh), and his sheer bloodlust allows him to overcome the control device meant to keep him in check and escape from the compound, leaving carnage in his wake. The Warriors arrive to hunt down the rogue dinosaur – and also to administer justice on Golgotha&#x27;s owner. For his part in multiple murders, the sentence is death, which is duly carried out. However, the youth&#x27;s father swears revenge on Hammerstein, and pays Blackblood to betray him. Tracking Golgotha to the city, Hammerstein prepares to kill the dinosaur, but his guns fail to fire and he is attacked. The robot is not defenceless, however, and uses his combat hammer to smash the dinosaur&#x27;s skull. Mortally wounded, Golgotha plummets from a flyover and is impaled on a spire below. Hammerstein has no proof that Blackblood sabotaged his guns – but delivers a beating as a warning that if he ever suspects treachery again, he will kill him.

Mad George (3 episodes, Mike McMahon)

Features George, a giant, clumsy robot with five brains which disagree with each other. At the close of the story the liquid-metal Mess becomes the living metal &#x27;blood&#x27; linking George&#x27;s brains to create a more cohesive robot.

Red Planet Blues (2000AD 1985 annual, Steve Dillon and John Higgins (colours))

Written by Alan Moore, his only ABC Warriors story. The Warriors are hired by a farm owner to protect her land and workers from unknown attackers. During their tenure they establish that the attackers are Martian natives, angry at the farmers smallholding and intrusion on their planet. At the end of the story the farmer is missing, presumed killed, and Hammerstein buries a dead native discovered when searching for the farmer.

The ABC Warriors next returned to 2000AD as supporting characters in Nemesis the Warlock Books IV-VI. By the time they returned to starring status in 1988, the line-up comprised Hammerstein, Joe, Blackblood, Mongrol, Mek-Quake and Ro-Jaws.

===The End of Time!===
(21 episodes, Simon Bisley and SMS; also called &quot;The Black Hole&quot; in reprints)

Sent by Nemesis to stabilise the artificial black and white holes that allow interstellar travel (and enabled the Terran Empire to conquer the galaxy) before they collide and destroy Earth, the Warriors pick up a new member – Terri. Although human, she has been raised by the robots and androids guarding the black hole complex – the Mekaniks – and considers herself to be a robot, and Hammerstein to be her true love. Deadlock also returns to rejoin the Warriors, though Hammerstein is suspicious of his motives – the follower of Khaos has more to gain from Earth&#x27;s destruction than its salvation.

As well as the Mekaniks, the Warriors must also face the soldiers of the Empire of this time period, led by the robot-hating Major Savard, as well as the ultimate evil – the Monad (which originally appeared in Nemesis the Warlock), a psychic monster formed from the distillation of all human evil that is able to take on any form.

The Warriors eventually fight their way to the control room, deep inside the tomb of Emperor Zallin, where Deadlock, Blackblood and Mek-Quake come under attack from automated defence systems. Hammerstein realises the truth – the defence systems scan robots to ensure that they are there to protect the tomb, and the three robots have been working to sabotage the mission and ensure Earth is destroyed. Hammerstein, Joe, Mongrol and Terri take on the renegades, but an unwilling truce is forced when Savard&#x27;s troops – and the Monad, disguised in the form of Abaddon, an alien bounty hunter – attack. Deadlock uses his dark powers to reach the control room and stabilise the black and white holes, but not before the destruction wrought by the impending collision causes the death of Terri.

Deadlock then draws upon the centuries of horror and bloodshed the Warriors have experienced to create a psychic warrior powerful enough to defeat – but not destroy – the Monad. The Warriors then escape by stealing Zallin&#x27;s tombship, taking the blame for the devastation and now the most wanted robots in the galaxy.

===Khronicles of Khaos===
(17 episodes, Kevin Walker)

On a mission to infect the Terran Empire with Khaos, Deadlock leads the ABC Warriors to the planet Hekate; here, they will kill seven figures of Order and harvest their heads as part of a ritual. As well as recruiting a new seventh member in Morrigun, the existing Warriors were altered by such close exposure to Khaos magick. Blackblood was able to become more vicious again, Joe was operated on to embrace cross-dressing, Mongrol became a true beast and even Hammerstein was influenced.

The Warriors undertake six assassinations in the run up to the lunar alignment known as the Night of the Blood Moon, as well as encountering the bizarre alien lifeforms on this world – the primal and Khaotic Night Mara, the Froyds who wander around at night acting out their brutal dreams, and the Phookas who vomit on people as a compliment. In the final battle went up against the Terran Imperial Rottweilers battalion and the reanimated Emperor Zalin. They succeeded in the end, bringing Khaos to the world (and a month-long party) and causing it to spread throughout the Empire. Due to its influence, the Warriors refused to follow Deadlock&#x27;s orders – fully embracing Khaos in the process – and Deadlock returned to his Kollege with Ro-Jaws.

===Hellbringer===
(17 episodes, Kevin Walker)

Ten years have passed since the &#x27;Hekate&#x27; mission, and the Terran Empire&#x27;s control has crumbled as a result. The Warriors have gone their separate ways, but assemble once more when the Terrans unveil a new super-weapon designed to undo the Warriors&#x27; tide of Khaos – the Hellbringer.

===The Third Element===

The &#x27;Third Element&#x27; saga was a story arc made up of five three-part stories. Medusa, the ancient planetary consciousness of Mars, has awoken, and by various means is attempting to purge the planet of the human colonists who are terraforming her. The Warriors return to Mars to &#x27;Increase the Peace&#x27; during the so-called Medusa War.

Roadkill (1 episode, Kevin Walker)

A short one-off &#x27;bridge&#x27; story in the special &#x27;Prog 2000&#x27; issue, to re-introduce the Warriors for the new century. Zombie bikers are terrorising the Martian highways, and only the Warriors can defeat them.

The Third Element (3 episodes, Henry Flint)

The Warriors intervene when Terran Biohazard troops attempt to ethnically cleanse the population of a Martian ghetto. Morrigun is destroyed in combat, and Mongrol&#x27;s original personality is rebooted when the Warriors are forced to relocate their brains into new bodies during the battle, turning him from a growling simpleton to a tough-talking, cigar-smoking soldier.

The Clone Cowboys (3 episodes, Liam McCormack-Sharpe)

The Warriors arrive at the Martian town of Redemption to investigate the disappearance of its inhabitants. They are ambushed by cloned copies of the humans, which turn into hideous mutants as they strike. An army of Medusa&#x27;s clones emerge from the town&#x27;s church, using its bell to create massive sonic vibrations that threaten to destroy the Warriors&#x27; brains and literally shake their bodies apart. However, Mek-Quake is immune (thanks to the small size of his brain) and loads up his killdozer body with explosives, ploughing into the church and blowing it – and the clones – to pieces just after he bails out in his secondary body. Victorious, the Warriors depart – but are watched by a mysterious horned figure from a hilltop.

The Tripods (3 episodes, Mike McMahon)

Taking inspiration from H. G. Wells&#x27; The War of the Worlds, Medusa next creates an army of tripods which invade Viking City and begin to massacre the population. The Warriors intervene and battle the tripods, but are stunned when the leader of the army is revealed – their old comrade Steelhorn, left behind on Mars centuries ago. Medusa destroyed Mad George for the crime of terraforming her, and found the Mess in the remains. Decoding his memories from the molten metal, she cast a new body for him from special martian alloys and Steelhorn was reborn, now as a crusader committed to fighting for Martian freedom. The battle reaches an impasse, and the Warriors realise that while the fighting raged the entire population of Viking City has been killed by a specially created Martian virus, just as the Martians were killed by Earth bacteria in The War of the Worlds. The Warriors reluctantly retreat, vowing a reckoning with Steelhorn.

The Zero Option (3 episodes, Boo Cook)

At a remote arctic base, the Warriors battle to stop the release of a bomb that will destroy Medusa utterly. During the battle, Steelhorn attacks again and President Cobb betrays the team in hopes of wiping them out for good.

Assault on the Red House (3 episodes, Henry Flint)

The Warriors take the battle to Mars President Cobb, but the electronic viruses that Medusa has been plaguing robotkind with begin to take their toll. One by one, the Warriors fall, and after escaping with the President the survivors are forced to bargain with Steelhorn. Deadlock suggests a compromise that will satisfy Medusa, Martiankind and Human alike – Cobb can stay in charge, but only after certain modifications have been made – the addition of an extra arm, eye and leg to make him a trinary being like other Martians. Thus appeased, Medusa calls off her attacks and returns to her deep slumber – the fallen Warriors are reactivated, and Steelhorn rejoins the team to help enforce the new peace.

===The Medusa Wars===
&quot;The Medusa Wars&quot; is an original novel written by Pat Mills and Alan Mitchell. Although there are questions about its &quot;canonicity&quot;, it introduces a number of pieces of information by the series comic strip&#x27;s creators, most of which have yet to be contradicted.

The novel tells of the events leading up to the Warriors&#x27; return to Mars and retells the story of &quot;The Third Element&quot; strip. It introduces the troubled marriage of Senator Diaz and Juanita Perez, and we see the latter&#x27;s relationship with Joe Pineapples develop. We are also witness to the disagreements between President Cobb and Senator Diaz, which lead to civil war. These elements are picked up in the following comic strip, &quot;The Shadow Warriors&quot;. By placing &quot;Roadkill&quot; after &quot;The Third Element&quot;, the novel contradicts the strip. In the comic, Morrigun appears in &quot;Roadkill&quot; and is killed in &quot;The Third Element&quot;. In the novel, she dies and then the events of &quot;Roadkill&quot; are said to have happened (without Morrigun&#x27;s appearance).

Mills has said of the novel: &quot;Parts are dramatisations of the comic strip. Notably the Biohazard troopers because they originally had excellent funky black dialogue contributed by my black co-writer on the novel, Alan Mitchell. This was altered at the time by 2000AD editorial without my knowledge and in an inappropriate and uncool way. It made my toes curl it was so wrong. So, I thought it was important to put it back the way it should be. I think the text version is much better. Although having said that, I&#x27;m sure some perverse fan is now going to say he preferred the comic version. In which case, my response would be I&#x27;m sure you enjoy McDonalds burgers, too.&quot;

===The Shadow Warriors===
Book I (6 episodes, Carlos Ezquerra)

Following the conclusion of the &#x27;Return To Mars&#x27; arc, civil war has broken out on the Red Planet. The human population has divided into the Union and the Confederacy. Recognising the threat the ABC Warriors pose to their plans for global domination, the leaders of the Confederacy hire Conflict Management – a company of &#x27;privatised peacekeepers&#x27; – to recruit the Shadow Warriors, a team of robots chosen specifically for their abilities to overcome each member of the Warriors.

The first members of the Shadow Warriors to be revealed are Bootleg, a robotic bounty hunter; Dog-Tag, a charming yet ruthless &#x27;pirate&#x27; of the trans-Martian highways; The Rev, a minister in the sinister robot religion of the Church of Judas, which Blackblood now follows; and Deus Ex Machina, an artificial intelligence – long thought mythical – capable of taking control of other machines and turning them to its will.

The story opens with Joe severely damaging Dog-Tag and wiping out his gang. The ABC Warriors discover a plot against them and engage Confederacy Behemeks alongside Union forces at Getty City. While Deus Ex Machina sabotages Union gun positions, the Rev attempts to assassinate Deadlock. The ABC Warriors head for New Sidona.

Book II (6 episodes, Henry Flint)

The Warriors reach New Sidona, where anarchy is breaking out as people wonder whether the Union or Confederacy will get there first. The robots drive off looting Cyboons before encountering a Talk Cone – a low-level robot agent of the Total Information Awareness agency that enforces the &#x27;no talking&#x27; rule the government requires to monitor the populace for thoughts of terrorism. However, the cone has been booby-trapped with a bomb by Deux Ex, so the Warriors have to act quickly to save a loud group of teenagers from the explosion.

Taking the teenagers and fending off more Cyboons, the Warriors encounter the next Shadow Warrior – Doctor Maniacus, a rogue paramedic droid who feeds off the pain of his human &#x27;patients&#x27; as he tortures and kills them. The psychotic medic unleashes the pain he has absorbed to overload the emotional circuits of the Warriors – however, Deadlock, having witnessed horrors beyond imagination in the service of Khaos, is immune. Doc Maniacus is able to fight off the Grand Wizard in single combat, but Deadlock plants a &quot;nanobat&quot; – a microscopic bug – on him before he escapes. Meanwhile, sixth Shadow Warrior is revealed to be the sadistic and manipulative Mr Lovebomb, attacks New Sidona with his army of mind-shattered military clones (which undergo psychological torments to produce the adrenaline for military drug Neuropeptide-A).

The Warriors reach Terrasand Square, causing Mayor/Sheriff/TIA Chief Terrasand to hurriedly switch his allegiance from the Confederacy to the Union. It turns out the Square is a trap as the Warriors are attacked from all sides by Lovebomb&#x27;s clones and Deus Ex&#x27; cone-bombs. The Warriors try to protect the humans and fight off the clones, while their Shadow counterparts – joined by their final member, the state-of-the-art killing machine Warmonger – prepare their attack...

Book III (10 episodes, Henry Flint)

The Shadows attack with state-of-the-art weaponry that is far superior to anything the ABC Warriors have in their arsenal. Steelhorn is the first to fall, reduced to molten slag by Doc Maniacus&#x27;s &#x27;sledgehammer&#x27; shells and trickling into a drain. Joe Pineapples attempts to snipe the Shadows but is caught unawares, shot in the head and buried by Dog-Tag. Realising they are outmatched, the Warriors and the humans they are protecting take shelter in the police precinct and prepare for a long siege.

Over the course of a long and protracted battle various Shadows and Warriors fall. Mek-Quake, his already unstable mind affected earlier by Mr Lovebomb&#x27;s heartbreaker bullets, seems increasingly unhinged. Deadlock locks himself away performing mysterious and sinister rituals on captured Confederate soldiers, refusing to be disturbed. Eventually the Warriors are forced by the imminent arrival of Confederate tanks into the open to face the remaining Shadows. Hammerstein decapitate Maniacus while Blackblood tackles the Rev. Mongrol tears Warmonger apart in a rage when makes the mistake of disparaging Lara. Dog Tag is hit and fatally wounded by his own bullets as it is revealed Joe Pineapples only faked his electronic death, allowing him to loot the Shadows&#x27; arsenal.

Just as it seems the ABC Warriors have prevailed, Bootleg leads the Confederate Behemeks in demolishing buildings and crushing the ABCs into the ground. However, now the purpose of Deadlock&#x27;s ritual becomes clear – he has bargained with Medusa for Steelhorn&#x27;s return, this time in a new, impervious diamond-bodied form. Steelhorn wipes out the remaining enemy resistance and the other ABCs join in the attack with the aid of newly arrived Union forces. The Confederate troops are destroyed, and the battered ABC Warriors are victorious.

===The Volgan War===
Volume I (9 episodes, Clint Langley)

The Warriors arrive at Broadband Asylum on Mars, a mental hospital for robots, to check in Mek-Quake for treatment. He hopefully asks that his place in the team be kept open for him, but after they leave him, the other Warriors make it clear they have no intention of taking him back. Only Hammerstein is bothered by the betrayal, while Blackblood positively revels in it.

Travelling to Marineris City to recruit a new member, the robots reminisce about their experiences in the Volgan War. Hammerstein tells of a battle against the fearsome Stalins, colossal war robots. Mongrol describes how his existence as a robo-paratrooper was ended by a faulty parachute, and his rebuilding by Lara – before she was murdered by Volgan forces for harbouring him. Joe, meanwhile, recalls an assassination mission where he was sent undercover to Moscow to destroy the &#x27;Ikon&#x27;, leader of the Volgan robotic forces: the fearsome Volkhan.

As the stories progress, it is revealed that all of the Warriors encountered Volkhan in their battles – as well as a Special Forces ABC robot called Zippo, who it becomes clear is going to become the latest member of the Warriors. Back at Broadband Asylum, Mek-Quake makes an unexpected discovery – one of the other inmates is none other than Volkhan himself...

Volume II (10 episodes, Clint Langley)

Volkhan tries to convince Mek-Quake to help him escape, but he refuses. That is, until he receives a call from Blackblood, who gloatingly informs him – &quot;as a friend&quot; – that his position in the ABC Warriors has been taken by Zippo. Dismayed and enraged, Mek-Quake makes a fateful decision...

Still travelling, the other Warriors continue their war memoirs. Blackblood takes glee in describing how he was the one responsible for the murder of Lara&#x27;s parents, which prompts a furious Mongrol to issue an ultimatum – when the mission is completed, either Blackblood leaves the Warriors, or he does. Next, Deadlock relates his encounter with Volkhan, and his destruction of his &#x27;son&#x27; Kalevala. Knowing that killing or imprisoning the Ikon will turn him into a martyr, Deadlock instead &#x27;operates&#x27; on Volkhan to prevent him from creating any more offspring – essentially castrating him.

As the Warriors arrive at Marineris to find and rescue Zippo, at Broadband Asylum Mek-Quake kills the guards and frees Volkhan and his comrades. As a reward, Volkhan promises the former demolition droid the chance to carry out &quot;the biggest job on Mars.&quot;

Volume III (10 episodes, Clint Langley)

Steelhorn recalls his war memoirs, explaining how he was viewed a modern-day knight by the west, and a war criminal by the Volgans. Volgan agents (Non other than Volkhan and Blackblood) plant a virus into Steelhorn while he slept, that caused Steelhorn to believe he was Volkhans slain son Kal, and proceeded to decimate the western frontlines and the civilian population. Hammerstein witnesses the carnage, losing his legs and his comrades to Steelhorns vortex hammer. Zippo arrives and proceeds to fight Steelhorn, eventually being able to plant an anti-virus which restores Steelhorn, who flees in shame. Horrified by his actions in the war, Steelhorn moves to a de-mobilization centre for reassignment, only to be thrown into a fusion furnace, sparking his hatred of humanity and his transformation into the mess.

Zippo now awaiting execution, recalls the events leading to this situation. Prior to his capture, Zippo sprayed anti-government graffiti across the city and dealt with the oppressive police force when required. Zippo meets with his mentor &quot;Kroll&quot;, and discovers that Kroll is being manipulated by Medusa into defacing the city as punishment for creating it. Detective inspector Sturn arrives with a squad of &quot;G men&quot;, killing Kroll and capturing Zippo, bringing him to the police headquarters &quot;Der Kran&quot;. Resisting interrogation, Zippo is sentenced to execution.

Meanwhile, Blackblood leaves the warriors and links up with Volkhan and Mek-quake on the martian highway. Volkhan has now assembled a team of loyal servants each with a personal score to settle with the warriors, and gifts Mek-quake with an industrial mobile excavator. They now proceed towards Marineris city obliterating everything in their path.

Volume IV (12 episodes, Clint Langley)

The Warriors succeed in rescuing Zippo despite Blackblood&#x27;s disappearance, delivering him to his ally &quot;Urban Fox&quot; who turns out to be Ro-jaws. Volkhan&#x27;s approach towards the city leads to a massive uprising of the city&#x27;s droids, forcing the Warriors to attack Der Kran to force a truce onto the G-men so that they can deal with Volkhan. After fighting through Volkhan&#x27;s crazed robot hoards, the Warriors engage Blackblood onboard Mek-Quake&#x27;s excavator. Blackblood gleefully reveals that he has supplied volkhans troops with information on their weaknesses, and has calibrated their weapons to exploit them.

Sustaining severe injuries, Steelhorn retrieves the vortex hammer from the museum of war, while Ro-jaws leads Mek-Quake away from the warriors by insulting his imaginary mother, much to Blackblood&#x27;s annoyance. The Warriors escape while Volkhan leads his forces on the red house. President Diaz, who has been brainwashing Joe Pineapples&#x27; former lover Juanita into sleeping with him, orders Sturn to execute the Warriors once they have defeated Volkhan, but instead chooses to evacuate once he hears of the Warriors impending defeat. Juanita, hearing Joe&#x27;s name, remembers her love for him and undoes Diaz&#x27;s brainwashing. Diaz attempts to kill Juanita, but Joe arrives and kills Diaz, saving Juanita as the red house is overrun by Volkhan&#x27;s forces.

Steelhorn returns with the vortex hammer, destroying Volkhan&#x27;s forces with the hammer. Sensing defeat, Volkhan and Blackblood escape while leaving Mek-quake to perish, vowing vengeance. Mek-Quake escapes the excavator via an ejector seat as it is destroyed by the vortex hammer. Immediately after Volkhan&#x27;s defeat, the G-men attack and prepare to finish off the Warriors. Zippo returns, with upgraded armour and leads a successful counterattack, driving the G-men back to Der Kran.

Months later, the Warriors prepare to leave to recruit a new member to fill Blackbloods vacancy. Mek-Quake is found to be publicising his book tour in union territory, while Juanita leaves Joe, needing time to recover from Diaz&#x27;s brainwashing. As they leave with their newest member (Zippo), Joe reads a thought mail from Blackblood, promising retribution for his defeat.

===Return to Earth===
(12 episodes, Clint Langley)
While attempting to meet with their mysterious armorer Tubal Caine, the Warriors vessel crashes from volcanic ash being sucked into the engine. Initially suspecting Volkhan, they are immediately attacked by tripods upon landing. While certain that this aggression is the work of the planetary consciousness Medusa, her motivations for attacking them remain a mystery. While fixing the engines, Hammerstein reveals his reluctance to return to Earth, revealing what happened prior to him joining Ro-busters.

Hammerstein&#x27;s last journey to earth saw him trying to inform fellow ABC warriors of their future, that they would be recycled instead of being reprogrammed. Despite initial resistance, the warriors eventually believed him and fought their way out of the recycling compound. With the authorities after him, Hammerstein hid at a war memorial, pretending to be part of the memorial via a paint job and an immobiliser. However, the FBI tracked him down and attempted to destroy him, with Hammerstein unable to move. Hammerstein invoked the forces of khaos (Which Deadlock would take credit for) and de-activated the immobiliser and went on the offensive. The other ABC warriors which were part of the memorial also re-activated and aided Hammersteins escape, sacrificing themselves to help him.

Meeting in DC with his UN contact, Hammerstein was briefed on his mission. The UN had made a move to completely remove war altogether and install a new method of dealing with conflict, but the Quartz controlled White House was vetoing the vote. Hammerstein&#x27;s mission was to kill the president, so the vote would swing in the UN&#x27;s favour. Infiltrating the White House, Hammerstein overcame the secret service and the Hammerstein mk IVs and encountered President Dick Quartz in the oval office. In order to kill him, Hammerstein had to get his ethical conductor, the software which gauges hostile targets to identify Quartz as an enemy. Hammerstein succeeded in getting Quartz to admit to various war crimes committed by the US in the Volgan war, his ethical conductor allowing Hammerstein to kill him. Hammerstein is then greeted by Howard Quartz, who displays little emotion for the death of his nephew. Hammerstein attempts to kill Quartz, but Quartz gleefully reveals that all his machines have a prime directive that prevents them from killing him. Hammerstein escapes and is given a new head by his UN contact, and then placed in a robot emporium, where he would meet Ro-Jaws. While in the emporium, Hammerstein learns that the UN vote was carried, with his UN contact revealed to be an African ambassador, successfully beats Great Britain in trade negotiations via the new method. This new method turns out to be one-on-one armed combat.

Hammerstein&#x27;s story then ends with him and Ro-Jaws reporting to Mek-Quake for destruction, but being recruited into Ro-Busters at the last moment, his new head preventing Quartz from identifying him.

With the ship repaired, the warriors depart and meet their mechanic Tubal caine, who Hammerstein reveals is in fact Happy Shrapnel.

===Return To Mars===
(12 episodes, Clint Langley) This story fills in a lot of the missing backstory of the Warriors since their return to Mars – revealing that their armourer Tubal is former teammate Happy Shrapnel, inadvertently resurrected from the grave hundreds of years after his death by Medusa, when she first woke. Seeing first-hand the chaos being wrought by Medusa&#x27;s plagues of zombies and martians, Happy sent a call out into the universe for the other Warriors, who felt compelled to fulfil their primary directive and return to the Red Planet to restore peace. Happy declined to join them on their return, instead renouncing warfare for the simpler life of a mechanic, and rejecting his &#x27;slave name&#x27; in favour of Tubal Caine. After the Warriors&#x27; many subsequent battles, it was he who patched them up.

In the time that followed his life as a mechanic, Tubal adopted a humpy son named Tom, who resembled a human unlike his humpy family. Tom was in the throes of being executed for heresy when tubal saved him, his crime being that Tom had proven that martian food and plant life was not toxic, but in fact increased a humans physical attributes, a belief that conflicted with Humpy traditions. Tubal was later approached by Howard Quartz with his new bodyguard, Mek-Quake. Quartz explained that he wanted Tubal to terminate Volkhan. Refusing to work for Quartz, Quartz activated the scrap robots in his scrapyard which immediately attacked Tubal. Sustaining severe injuries, Tubal fended off the machines but came under attack from Mek-Quake, who eventually succeeded in tearing off Tubal&#x27;s head. In an attempt to save Tubal, Tom opened fire on Mek-Quake, but his weapon jammed, allowing Mek-Quake to murder him. The sustained damage and the shock of seeing his son murdered caused Tubal to suffer a system crash, which Quartz had intended.

Upon re-activation and re-attaching his head, Tubal was restored to default status, becoming Happy Shrapnel again and no longer a pacifist. Seeing the crime Quartz committed, and receiving news that Quartz was supplying both factions in the martian civil war, the warriors agree that there never can truly be peace on mars as long as Quartz lives. With Happy Shrapnel part of the warriors, the team sets out to kill Quartz. in order to overcome their prime directive which prohibits this, Hammerstein suggests they find Ro-Jaws, the only machine to ever show signs of being able to negate the prime directive.

==Chronology==

Although no dates were specified at the time, the 2006–07 series &quot;The Volgan War&quot; explicitly places that conflict in 2082–84, with the invasion of Western Europe in 1999 (from &quot;Invasion!&quot;) as backstory and considered to be World War III in the ABC timeline. This retcons out the Judge Dredd strip &quot;Hammerstein&quot;, which placed the ABC Warriors in Dredd&#x27;s universe and showed Hammerstein involved in 2071&#x27;s Battle of Armageddon &quot;after&quot; the Volgan War and the Mars mission.

After the Volgan War, the Warriors take part in the original Mars mission and subsequently disband. Hammerstein ends up back on Earth and ultimately joins Ro-Busters.

The adventures of the ABC Warriors in &quot;Nemesis&quot; Books 3 to 6 take place &quot;thousands&quot; of years later, with Earth having since become Termight, a quasi-mediaeval future society where the knowledge for making robots belongs to the Lost Age of Science. All robots who have lived thus far have become antiquated relics, forced to salvage spare parts from fallen colleagues to survive. Book 6 sees them travel forward billions of years in time to the end of the earth, where they first encounter the Monad. When the Warriors part company with Nemesis in Book 6, they travel back in time (via the time-tubes) to a period slightly prior to Termight – the Terran Empire, a much more technologically orientated society – for their remaining post-Nemesis adventures.

Several centuries have passed since their original mission on Mars by the time they return to the Red Planet for &quot;The Third Element&quot; arc and all subsequent stories. The Biol corporation is still a major player and Mars&#x27; civilisation is largely the same, though enough time has passed for some Martian races, such as the Humpies and Cyboons, to degenerate to a lower state of being. The ABC warriors&#x27; original Mars mission has passed into near-legendary status, with most believing the warriors to be long since dead prior their return. A character in &quot;Return To Mars&quot; mentions having been taught about their adventures in school.

<doc id="602565" wikidata="Q254907" url="?curid=602565" title="Genrō">
<text>was an unofficial designation given to a generation of elder Japanese statesmen, all born in the 1830s and 1840s, who served as informal extraconstitutional advisors to the emperor during the Meiji, Taishō, and early Shōwa eras of Japanese history.

The institution of &quot;genrō&quot; originated with the traditional council of elders (&quot;Rōjū&quot;) common in the Edo period; however, the term &quot;genrō&quot; appears to have been coined by a newspaper only in 1892. The term is sometimes confused with the &quot;Genrōin&quot; (Chamber of Elders), a legislative body which existed from 1875–1890; however, the &quot;genrō&quot; were not related to the establishment of that body or its dissolution.

Experienced leaders of the Meiji Restoration were singled out by the Emperor as , and asked to act as Imperial advisors. With the exception of Saionji Kinmochi, all the &quot;genrō&quot; were from medium or lower ranking &quot;samurai&quot; families, four each from Satsuma and Chōshū, the two former domains that had been instrumental in the overthrow of the former Tokugawa shogunate in the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration of 1867–1868. The &quot;genrō&quot; had the right to select and nominate Prime Ministers to the Emperor for approval.

The first seven genrō were all formerly members of the &quot;Sangi&quot; (Imperial Council) which was abolished in 1885. They are also sometimes known to historians as the Meiji oligarchy, although not all of the Meiji oligarchs were &quot;genrō&quot;.

The institution expired in 1940, with the death of the last of the &quot;genrō&quot;, Saionji Kinmochi.

<text>The Long Mynd is a heath and moorland plateau that forms part of the Shropshire Hills in Shropshire, England. The high ground, which is common land and designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, lies between the Stiperstones range to the west and the Stretton Hills and Wenlock Edge to the east. Much of it is owned by the National Trust, and is managed by the Longmynd Commoners.

The Long Mynd is approximately long by wide, and is broadly characterised by steep valleys on its eastern flanks, and a long slope to the western side rising in a steep escarpment. In its vicinity are the principal settlements of Church Stretton, Little Stretton and All Stretton, Pulverbatch, Smethcott, Woolstaston, Asterton, Myndtown, Wentnor and Ratlinghope.

The highest point on the Long Mynd is Pole Bank (); this and the adjacent hill of Caer Caradoc () are classed as Marilyns.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Long Mynd&quot; means &quot;long mountain&quot;, the second element being Brittonic in origin. In modern Welsh it is named &quot;Mynydd Hir&quot; , which has the same meaning, or &quot;Cefn Hirfynydd&quot;, meaning &quot;long mountain ridge&quot;.

==Commoning on Long Mynd==
There is pollen evidence to show that trees began to be replaced by grass on the plateau of the Long Mynd from the Bronze Age and written evidence of organised management as a grazed common from the 13th century. The Long Mynd commoners&#x27; ponies and sheep grazed here are hardy animals and are well adapted to the harsh conditions of life on the hill. They graze selectively and very close to the ground, leaving patches of long vegetation which benefits insects and small mammals.

This grazing pattern has resulted in a special ecology and the Long Mynd Common is therefore designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. To enhance the ecology the commoners have, since 1999 been in an environmental stewardship scheme that also supports sustainable farming practices.

Livestock grazing plays an important role in maintaining species-rich habitats by controlling the more aggressive plant species which would otherwise dominate the area.

Other than the boundary fence which is largely maintained by the commoners, there is no other fencing on the hill that restricts the movement of livestock. Therefore, to undertake routine husbandry tasks, commoners use dogs to gather their flocks together before driving them off the hill back to the farm. The sheep from each farm know instinctively where their flock&#x27;s grazing boundary is. This ancient practice, known as hefting, is passed down the generations of sheep through the shepherding by the commoners.

==Geology==

===Precambrian===
The geology dates back to the Precambrian, and during at least part of that long period this area would have been around 60° south of the equator, the same as the current latitude of the Falkland Islands. Shropshire would have been at the very edge of a large continent near the sea, which was being buckled by tectonic activity, causing volcanoes to form. The area had broad rivers; evidence of mudflats has been found. The rivers would have flowed out to sea, creating large estuaries; over time, the mudflats would have built up, and volcanic eruptions deposited ash in layers between the sand and mud. The primary rock of the Long Mynd is sandstone, usually coloured purple or grey. The volcanoes created the nearby Stretton Hills and the Wrekin, and eruptions would have been frequent. There are layers in the rocks of the Long Mynd that were previously described as raindrop marks. Unpublished research, including electron micrographs, by Professor Martin Brasier, showed that these are actually ichnofossils created by an unknown Ediacaran biota. Field observations of the stratigraphy present, and its laminar nature, leave no doubt that they are in a marine environment; the absence of infilled or mineralised syncresis (shrinkage cracks) adds to this. Examples of these fossilised marks can be viewed today in the National Trust tearoom exhibition, in Carding Mill Valley. The layers of rock built up over the millennia to create an approximately thick layer composed of sand, mud, silt and very occasional thin ash bands. The stratigraphy, mineral compositions and surrounding volcanology suggests an infilling island arc basin.

Towards the end of the Precambrian, the volcanoes ceased their eruptions, and the rivers had dried up. Instead the forces that created the volcanoes caused the new rocks to lift and fold, creating mountains and valleys in the area. Much of the rock was melted during this period, underneath the Earth&#x27;s crust, causing the mountains to continually change towards the latter part of the Precambrian. The Church Stretton Fault Zone probably formed during this period. It is still active today. The hill of Caer Caradoc adjacent to the Long Mynd and from the same time is volcanic in origin, and is thought to be a remnant of the great mountain chain.

=== Silurian period ===
The Precambrian rocks forming the Long Mynd massif are unconformably overlain on their southern and eastern margins by a suite of Silurian age sandstones and shales; the Pentamerus Sandstone, Purple Shales and overlying Bromsleymill Shale formations.

=== Quaternary period ===
As elsewhere in the Marches, a succession of ice ages during the last 2.6 million years have glacially modified the landscape of this area. During the last ice age as glacial ice covered much of Shropshire, a tongue of Irish Sea ice reached into the Church Stretton valley from the north filling it to a height of 260m. Like nearby Stiperstones and Long Mountain, the Long Mynd itself is not considered to have been over-ridden by ice during this ice age. The Onny Valley Glacier pushed around the southern margin of the Long Mynd; one of many lowland outlets for the Welsh Ice Sheet. A series of meltwater channels on the eastern side of the Long Mynd is associated with the wasting of the ice mass. After the retreat of the ice, downcutting of the batches and hollows continued during a prolonged period of wetter climate. A series of alluvial cones and fans formed from sand and gravel derived from this erosion, extend into the main valley. Downcutting continues today at a much reduced rate.

Today the steep and narrow valleys are covered in a thin layer of acidic soil, able to support only strong grasses, rushes and heathers. 

From 2006, University of Cambridge scientists monitored seismic activity in the Long Mynd. The broadband seismometer was connected to the internet, and real-time traces viewable online.

==History==


===Bronze Age===

Numerous sites are recorded from the Bronze Age on the Long Mynd including tumuli (also referred to as barrows), chambered tombs, dykes and cross-ridge dykes.

Barristers Plain Cross-Ridge Dyke runs southwest to northeast, almost in a straight line for across the narrowest section of the ridge between Grindle Hill and Round Hill. The heather-covered remains of the dyke are about wide, and high. On its western side it is fronted by a wide ditch. At both ends of the Cross Ridge Dyke, it fades into the steep hillside. A gap in the dyke, from the south-east end, is thought to make room for a trackway along the ridge. Its purpose was to cut off Grindle Hill from the main plateau, and to create a barrier to access from the west.

Devil&#x27;s Mouth Cross-Ridge Dyke lies between Cardingmill Valley and Townbrook Valley. The dyke is long, but is cut though by the Burway road and a small car park, of the dyke is now missing. Both ends of the dyke end on steep slopes. It was built with stone and earth, and is wide, and high, with shallow ditches either side. It is roughly 1,500 years old. It was probably built to control the access along the ancient east to west route, which still crosses the Long Mynd today by means of a modern road.

At High Park Cross-Ridge Dyke is the longest on the Long Mynd. It is approximately wide, but in areas survives only as a crop mark. The highest point of the dyke, on the west side of the bank, stands at high, and reaches its widest point at . A trackway, like that found on Barristers Plain Cross-Ridge Dyke, cuts through the dyke.

Of the Long Mynd Barrows, over twenty scatter the plateau. The best examples are in the northern area of the Long Mynd. Robin Hood&#x27;s Butts barrow, near Duckley Nap, are two well known barrows, and the largest on the Long Mynd, being approximately in diameter and high.

The Shooting Box Barrow is named after a grouse-shooting hut that stood on the site until it was removed in 1992. It is the only known example of a disc barrow in Shropshire. in diameter and high, it is in the centre of a flat circular enclosure in diameter, the edge of which is defined by a wide bank, which has been partially destroyed by a modern path. It had been dated to 1950–1700 BC.

The Portway is an ancient trackway, which runs the length of the Long Mynd massif, and is the largest historical feature on the Long Mynd, at just over long. It is still walked today, and is part of the Shropshire Way, and a road that goes to the Gliding Club. A common misconception is that it goes over Pole Bank, but instead it bypasses the hill, following its contours.

===Iron Age===

Bodbury Ring is an Iron Age hillfort atop Bodbury Hill at , overlooking Carding Mill Valley. Another hillfort sits on the nearby summit of Caer Caradoc. Bodbury Ring is now looked after by the National Trust. There is very little other human activity recorded from this period on the Long Mynd.

===18th century===

During the 18th century, Church Stretton began to grow in the wide valley between the Long Mynd and Caer Caradoc, as a market town, and later a spa. Historically the town was known for its textiles, specifically in Cardingmill Valley. Carding Mill was built in the 18th century, and named after a stage in making cloth, the three stages being carding, spinning and weaving. Carding would have been done by children, and involved using a hand-card that removed and untangled short fibres from the mass of raw material. The cards were wooden blocks with handles and covered in metal spikes, which were angled, (to make it easier to untangle) and set in leather. When untangled, the material would be spun, and then weaved into the final product. The mill was irreparably damaged in a flood around the turn of 20th century. The factory that served the mill is still in the valley today, and after being turned into a hotel for many years has now been converted into luxury apartments.

===20th century===

The Long Mynd Hotel in Church Stretton was built in 1901, originally as the Hydro, at a time when the town was popular as a spa.

A large area of the Long Mynd (almost all its upland area) was bought by the National Trust in 1965, and was designated an AONB as part of the Shropshire Hills in 1958.

==Highest points==

The Long Mynd comprises many hills and moors. From the summit of nearly every hill, there are extensive views of the surrounding area and surrounding counties. North, one can see as far as Cheshire; west commands views over the Stiperstones, and into Wales; the Cambrian Mountains in Powys, notably the Berwyn range and as far as Snowdonia on clear days. The views east are obscured by other areas of the Shropshire Hills, Caer Caradoc, the Wrekin and the Clee Hills. From some locations there are views of the West Midlands. Views south are towards Clun Forest, Craven Arms and Ludlow.

==Tourism and recreation==
Long Mynd is part of the Shropshire Hills National Landscape (or AONB) and is a popular tourist destination, particularly due to the many footpaths, varied terrain and impressive scenery and views. Two promoted recreational trails are the Shropshire Way and the Jack Mytton Way. The Long Mynd&#x27;s open spaces make it a popular place for horse riding and mountain biking on the bridleways.

Carding Mill Valley is the busiest location as it is home to the National Trust&#x27;s centre for the area.

The windward slopes to the west are popular with glider, hang-glider and paraglider pilots.

In 2015 snow gates were installed at various points of access onto the Long Mynd, to deter motorists planning to use the routes in wintry conditions.

The Longmynd Hike is a competitive race that crosses over the Long Mynd twice and must be completed in under 24 hours. It has been running since 1967 and takes place annually, usually on the first weekend in October.

There is a golf course, the Church Stretton Golf Club, located near the Cardingmill Valley, on the slopes of Stanyeld Hill and Bodbury Hill. The is at approximately above sea level and the hilly links course rises up to around 375 m (1,230 ft). It is the oldest 18-hole golf course in Shropshire, opened in 1898, and one of the highest in the country.

Cycle racing&#x27;s British National Hill Climb Championship was held on the Burway, the road ascending the Long Mynd from Church Stretton, in 1989. The title was won by Chris Boardman, the second of his four National Hill Climb titles, who went on to win a gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics and have a successful professional cycling career.

===Gliding===

The Long Mynd has been home to the Midland Gliding Club since 1934, utilising the slope of the ground in a Westerly wind for gliders to continue flight (for many hours if required) in the rising air over and above the ridge, before &quot;catching a thermal&quot; (rising air under a cumulus cloud) and flying elsewhere, before returning to the Mynd at the end of the day so that a &quot;road retrieve&quot; of the glider is not required.

The club owns of land on the south end and flies throughout the year. It runs residential training courses and offers members of the public trial lesson flights, see Midland Gliding Club. Many long glider flights have started from the Long Mynd, for instance one of during the summer of 2007.

The gliding club is one of the few remaining clubs in Europe to regularly launch gliders by bungee. One early distinguished past member was Amy Johnson, from 1937 to 1939.

==Flora and fauna==
Historical grazing rights are held by the Long Mynd commoners who graze sheep and ponies on the land. The grazing livestock slow the invasion of trees by pushing into the scrub and bracken helping to create and maintain the heath. They also graze in the pools, eating the pondweed and consequently there is a healthy population of brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) and otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;). Tree pipit (&quot;Anthus trivialis&quot;) and red grouse (&quot;Lagopus lagopus scotica&quot;) are found here as well as the recent arrival of the grayling butterfly (&quot;Hipparchia semele&quot;).

Carr&#x27;s &quot;A Night in the Snow&quot; describes his experience, in 1865, of surviving a winter&#x27;s night on the Long Mynd when attempting to walk home after conducting a Sunday service and visiting an isolated parishioner. He spent 23 hours struggling to force a route to safety.

The Long Mynd features in literature in the poetry of A. E. Housman, the novels of Mary Webb (in particular &quot;Gone to Earth&quot;), Malcolm Saville&#x27;s &quot;Lone Pine&quot; series for children, and Sheena Porter&#x27;s &quot;The Knockers&quot; (1965).

<text>Marine Atlantic Inc. () is an independent Canadian federal Crown corporation which is mandated to operate ferry services between the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia.

Marine Atlantic&#x27;s corporate headquarters are in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Current operations==
Marine Atlantic operates ferries across the Cabot Strait on two routes:
* North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador
* North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador

The Port aux Basques route is operated year-round. This service was assumed by Canadian National Railway in 1949 from the Newfoundland Railway when the Dominion of Newfoundland entered into Canadian Confederation.

The Argentia, Placentia route is operated seasonally during the summer (June–September). This service was established by CNR in 1967. As a result of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the Argentia, Placentia service was suspended for that year on May 8, 2020.

==History of Newfoundland ferry services==

From 1851, when the Colony of Newfoundland took over the operation of the post office, the government contracted for packet boats. By 1860 subsidized schooners were operating on the northeast coast from Greenspond to New Perlican, and along the south coast from Placentia to Channel-Port aux Basques. The first steam-packet, &quot;Lady LeMarchant&quot;, operated on Conception Bay after 1852.

In 1860 the government decided to subsidize a regularly scheduled steamer service. The first vessel chartered to the service was &quot;Victoria&quot; in 1862. In 1863, &quot;Ariel&quot; took over, alternating a northern run to Twillingate (later extended to Tilt Cove) with a southern run to LaPoile. In 1871 Grieve and Co. replaced &quot;Ariel&quot; with &quot;Leopard&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot;, inaugurating northern and southern runs based at St. John&#x27;s, to Battle Harbour in the north, and to Halifax in the south. After 1877 the two-steamer coastal service continued with Bowring Brothers&#x27; &quot;Curlew&quot; and &quot;Plover&quot;, while &quot;Lady Glover&quot; ran in Conception Bay. In 1888 Harvey &amp; Co. took over the service, with &quot;Conscript&quot; (on the northern service) and &quot;Volunteer&quot;. The packet &quot;Hercules&quot;, later &quot;Alert&quot;, began running in Placentia Bay, while &quot;Favourite&quot; ran in Trinity Bay and &quot;Lady Glover&quot; in Notre Dame Bay. Once the railway reached Harbour Grace there was no need for a steam-packet on Conception Bay. After &quot;Volunteer&quot; was lost in 1891, Harvey&#x27;s commissioned &quot;Grand Lake&quot; and renamed &quot;Conscript&quot; to &quot;Virginia Lake&quot;. Meanwhile, Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;Harlaw&quot; served western Newfoundland, out of Halifax.

With its completion of the Newfoundland Railway in 1898 and following its agreement with the Newfoundland Government, the Reid Newfoundland Company under Robert G. Reid began operating coastal and ferry services for the island and Labrador, to be integrated with the railway. By 1900 they comprised a fleet of eight vessels known as the Alphabet Fleet. Each vessel in the Alphabet Fleet was built in Scotland and given the name of a Scottish location by the Reids, who were from Scotland.

In 1904, in response to complaints about the Reid service, the Newfoundland government subsidized the use of two outside vessels for the coastal service, the Portia and Prospero, and in 1912, set up a similar arrangement for use of the Sagona and Fogota.

In 1923, under the Railway Settlement Act, the government took over the island&#x27;s railway. They purchased the Alphabet Fleet from the Reids and placed it under the railway&#x27;s control. In 1924, &quot;Portia&quot;, &quot;Prospero&quot; and &quot;Sagona&quot; were purchased outright, and another vessel, &quot;Malakoff&quot;, was brought into service. In 1925, began her service on the Gulf run.

The Newfoundland Royal Commission, formed in 1933 by the government of the UK to examine the future of Newfoundland in light of its then financial difficulties, examined the operation of ferries as part of its investigation. It recommended that an expert inquiry be held into the ferry services with a view particularly to the prevention of overlapping, more efficient and economical working and the readjustment of freight rates on a carefully planned and scientific basis.

After Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949, the Newfoundland Railway and its ferry services became part of the Canadian National Railway.

In 1977, CN&#x27;s marine operations in Atlantic Canada were passed to a subsidiary, CN Marine.

==Formation of Marine Atlantic==
Marine Atlantic was established in 1986 to take over the provision of ferry services in Atlantic Canada which had previously been operated by CN Marine, a subsidiary of Canadian National Railway. Its headquarters were in Moncton, New Brunswick.

Extensive budget cuts by the Government of Canada during the latter part of the 1990s led to a drastic downsizing of Marine Atlantic&#x27;s operations, precipitated by the 1997 opening of the Confederation Bridge which replaced Marine Atlantic&#x27;s most heavily used ferry service, the constitutionally-mandated ferry to Prince Edward Island.

Later in 1997, the company transferred the operation of its Bay of Fundy and Gulf of Maine ferry services between Saint John, New Brunswick-Digby, Nova Scotia, and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia-Bar Harbor, Maine, to the private-sector company Bay Ferries Limited, a subsidiary of Northumberland Ferries Limited.

That year also saw Marine Atlantic remove itself from the provision of coastal ferry services in Newfoundland and Labrador with the transfer of operations to the provincial government at the end of the 1997 shipping season. This agreement was reached between the federal and provincial governments in exchange for federal funding to extend regional roads such as the Trans-Labrador Highway to service coastal communities. These coastal ferry services had been initiated by the Newfoundland Railway and were assumed by Canadian National Railways, following the province&#x27;s entry into Confederation in 1949, although they were not constitutionally mandated. Also in 1997 Marine Atlantic sold off its Newfoundland Dockyard, located in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland to a private operator. The dockyard built in the 1880s was at one point in time owned by the Reid Newfoundland Company, then in 1923 was taken over by the Newfoundland Railway company. when Newfoundland joined Canada ownership passed to Canadian National.

In 1998, the company moved its headquarters from Moncton to St. John&#x27;s, after briefly considering North Sydney and Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and Labrador.

In late 2004, the federal government announced the appointment of a three-member committee tasked with examining future operations of Marine Atlantic. One of the options that was reportedly considered included privatization, however the subsequent report called for improved service through fleet renewal, lower fares, increased frequency of crossings, and moving the headquarters to Port aux Basques.

In 2010, Marine Atlantic announced that the Canadian government was planning to invest around $900 million in the ferry operations. Two ferries, the and the , were replaced by newer ships initially chartered from Stena Line. On land, all three terminals at Marine Atlantic&#x27;s ports received extensive renovations, including the construction of a new terminal building at the North Sydney facility.

== Fleet ==

, purchased in 2001, is a significantly smaller and lower-capacity ferry than other vessels in the fleet. &quot;Leif Ericson&quot; is 18,500 registered tons and 157 metres long, carrying 500 passengers, and 250 automobile-equivalent vehicles.

 was originally chartered from the Estonia-based Tallink for five years starting in October 2008; in February 2015, Marine Atlantic announced that the lease on the vessel had been renewed until November 2017 for a cost of Can$40 million. At , &quot;Atlantic Vision&quot; was the largest ship in Marine Atlantic fleet and the largest ferry in North America.

On May 21, 2010, Marine Atlantic announced that the company had agreed to charter two vessels from the Stena Line to replace the aging &quot;Gulfspan&quot; class vessels and . The new vessels, built in 2006 and 2007, boosted capacity and lowered operating costs, as they consumed less fuel. On September 29, 2010, Marine Atlantic announced the names of the new vessels: and . &quot;Blue Puttees&quot; went into service March 2011, with &quot;Highlanders&quot; following in April 2011. In May 2015, Marine Atlantic announced that it had purchased both vessels from Stena for Can$100 million each. In July 2021, Marine Atlantic ordered an E-Flexer on charter from Stena RoRo for five years. It will carry 1000 passengers and contain 2571 lane metres of vehicle space. The MV Ala’suinu entered service in July 2024, and is capable of running on diesel, liquid natural gas or battery electric.

==Historical fleet==

Marine Atlantic inherited numerous vessels from CN Marine in 1986, all of which have since been removed from service. Many of these vessels have gone through numerous ownership changes and, given their advanced age, most have been scrapped.

==Former routes==

From its inception in 1986 until 1997, Marine Atlantic operated the following routes:

*Port aux Basques, NL along Newfoundland&#x27;s remote South Coast serving outports and larger centres such as Burgeo and Ramea to Terrenceville
*Lewisporte, NL, and St. Anthony, NL along the rugged Labrador coast serving outports and larger centres such as Cartwright and Happy Valley-Goose Bay to Nain
*Borden, PE to Cape Tormentine, NB
*Saint John NB to Digby, NS
*Yarmouth, NS to Bar Harbor, Maine

==Newfoundland Dockyard==

Marine Atlantic operated the Newfoundland Dockyard, a dry dock located in St. John&#x27;s from 1986 until its sale in 1997. This facility had been established by the Newfoundland Railway to build and repair its coastal ferries. In 1949 it was transferred to Canadian National Railways after that company assumed ownership of the Newfoundland Railway when the country entered Confederation. Its responsibility was transferred to the railway&#x27;s subsidiary CN Marine in 1977 and then to Marine Atlantic in 1986. Upon its privatization in 1997, it was renamed NewDock-St. John&#x27;s Dockyard Company.

<doc id="602568" wikidata="Q5723301" url="?curid=602568" title="Henry Howard, 12th Earl of Suffolk">
<text>Henry Howard, 12th Earl of Suffolk, 5th Earl of Berkshire, KG, PC (16 May 1739 – 7 March 1779), was a British politician, styled Viscount Andover from 1756 to 1757.

Educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford, he succeeded his grandfather as Earl of Suffolk in 1757. He was awarded a MA degree from Oxford in 1759 and a DCL degree in 1761. He was High Steward of Malmesbury from 1763 to 1767, and Deputy Earl Marshal from 1763 to 1765. On 25 May 1764, he married Hon. Maria Constantia Hampden-Trevor, daughter of Robert Hampden-Trevor, 1st Viscount Hampden, who died on 7 February 1767 giving birth to their only child: 
*Maria Constantia Howard (7 February 1767 – 21 July 1775)

In 1771, he was appointed a Privy Counsellor (PC) and briefly served as Lord Privy Seal before becoming Secretary of State for the Northern Department under Lord North from 1771 to 1779. In this capacity, he secured the use of Hessian and Hanoverian mercenaries to help suppress the American Revolution. In the same capacity he helped to secure the survival of Sweden as an independent nation by counteracting Russia&#x27;s plan to undo the Revolution of Gustavus III in 1772. He was made a Knight of the Garter (KG) in 1778.

On 14 August 1777, Suffolk married Lady Charlotte Finch, daughter of Heneage Finch, 3rd Earl of Aylesford, by whom he had two children:
*George Howard, Viscount Andover (September 1778 – 27 December 1778)
*Henry Howard, 13th Earl of Suffolk (8 August 1779 – 10 August 1779)

He died on 7 March 1779; his posthumous son Henry succeeded him for two days in August.

He is buried in Charlton Church, Wiltshire, together with his first wife.

<doc id="602570" wikidata="Q1968514" url="?curid=602570" title="David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield">
<text>David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield, 7th Viscount of Stormont, (9 October 1727 – 1 September 1796) known as The Viscount of Stormont from 1748 to 1793, was a British diplomat and politician. He succeeded to both the Mansfield and Stormont lines of the Murray family, inheriting two titles and two fortunes.

==Background==
Mansfield was the son of David Murray, 6th Viscount of Stormont, and his wife, Anne Stewart, heiress of John Stewart of Innernytie. The Lord Chief Justice, William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, was his paternal uncle and mentor. Stormont inherited the family&#x27;s estate and title of Viscount Stormont at 21 when his father died in 1748. The ancestral seat of the Viscounts Stormont is Scone Palace.

==Diplomat==

Stormont&#x27;s uncle was determined to advance his nephew and heir, so he carefully planned Stormont&#x27;s education and occupation. He excelled in the study of the classics and languages especially latin, so it was decided that he would become a diplomat.

Stormont became ambassador to Saxony-Poland, Austria and then to France with the help of his uncle, in the early years of the American War of Independence, he played a role in sending news of American actions back to England. He had been elected a Scottish representative peer in 1754. He also made a lifelong friend in William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, when he was sent to study under Stormont for a year in Warsaw, at the request of Stormont&#x27;s uncle and the Duchess of Portland. The Duke was accompanied by Stormont&#x27;s secretary, Benjamin Langlois.

When Frederick II of Prussia invaded Saxony, the Elector of Saxony was forced to retreat from Dresden to Warsaw, capital of his Polish kingdom. Stormont followed, he had previously met a German Imperial Countess (Reichsgrafin) in Dresden, her name was Henrietta Frederica von Bünau, daughter of Imperial Count Heinrich von Bünau. They fell in love and were married in Warsaw, Poland in 1759. Walpole wrote &quot;Lord Stormont is actually married and is the happiest creature in the world, I would have him always so for his is the best.&quot;

His marriage was unexpected, instead of a calculated marriage with a British peerage like his uncle, he opted to marry for love to Countess Henrietta. Before her 2nd marriage, Henrietta was already a young and wealthy noble widow, her 1st husband had died young and bequeathed her all his fortune and three Danish estates. After marrying Stormont, she sold them in 1760. Stormont&#x27;s uncle Lord Chief Justice encouraged him on his courtship, he even sent letters to Henrietta, future Countess of Mansfield and welcoming her to the family.

=== Vienna ===
Then Stormont was appointed British Ambassador to Austria in 1763 to 1772 at the court of Empress Maria Theresa. Stormont&#x27;s wife, who was a German noblewoman by birth helped him be accepted by the high society of Vienna. She was a woman of enormous charm, this made up for the reserved manner of her husband, this made the embassy to Vienna a huge success.

His wife&#x27;s health was always fragile, Horace Walpole described her as such a Semele. In 1766, Henrietta suddenly died in Vienna at the age of only 29. Her death caused Stormont to have a nervous breakdown and was given extended leave of absence, he embalmed her heart in a gold vase and carried it everywhere he went (later taken to Scone). They had one surviving daughter Lady Elizabeth Murray, who was eventually brought up by his uncle and his wife at Kenwood House.

Stormont described his wife as &quot;Flourishing in the prime of life, in talent, in beauty, [and] remarkable for every praise, endowed with every virtue, she met a death happy to herself, [but] deeply bitter to her friends, parent and most wretched husband&quot;.His friend a fellow diplomat, Sir William Hamilton said to his niece Mary Hamilton, that if it wasn&#x27;t for his help to get him out of his depression and recovered in Rome, he believed that Stormont might have gone mad, Hamilton said that the countess had a very elegant mind. Stormont didn&#x27;t return to his post for two years and remained unmarried for a decade, despite the urgent need of providing an heir to keep both his and his uncle&#x27;s titles from extinction.

The great antiquarian Johann Joachim Winckelmann (whom he met in Rome in 1768), had worked as librarian to Stormont&#x27;s father in-law (Count von Bünau). He remarked that Stormont was &quot;the most learned man of his rank whom I have yet known&quot;.

After his return from Rome, the final four years in Vienna were dominated by the Russo-Turkish War which began in 1768, He protested unofficially about the partitioning of Poland, but the partition was finalised in 1772.

Upon leaving Vienna, he was gifted a gold box set with diamonds by Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor.

=== Paris ===
By now Stormont had become a leading British diplomat, this followed by ambassador to Paris from 1772 to March 1778. In France, he met Queen Marie Antoinette, whom he had acquainted back when she was a little archduchess in the court of her mother in Vienna years prior, The Queen of France was very pleased to be greeted by a friendly face and befriended the Viscount, it was said that he taught the young queen how to reels, to commemorate their friendship, she gifted him one of three Jean Henri Riesener writing desks previously commissioned to mark her marriage. Marie Antoinette nicknamed him &quot;le bel Anglais&quot; meaning the beautiful English.In 1774, when his uncle Lord Mansfield stayed at the French Embassy, Lord Stormont presented his uncle to Louis XVI and Marie Antionette at the Palace of Versailles. He was valued amongst French nobility for his intelligent brain, kind heart, and good looks, which he carried into middle age. He remarried after a decade to younger Louisa Cathcart in 1776.

When the French government secretly sent funds to America. The Americans built a frigate at Amsterdam, and another at Nantes. The French also contributed the means for supplying American privateers, that came into their ports. Every thing was done with as much discreet as possible; but Stormont, the British ambassador, had spies in all the principal ports, and was aware of all their proceedings.

Benjamin Franklin wrote to Stormont in April 1777 about exchanging prisoners, for which he didn&#x27;t receive a satisfactory answer, later some prisoners were exchanged but the channel of exchanges wasn&#x27;t always established.

In March 1778, France declared support for the American revolution against Britain. Hence, the ambassadors to both countries were recalled and Stormont returned to England. Madame du Deffand, lamented him as a friend and frequenter of her celebrated parties. ‘‘ I find wit in your Ambassador,” she wrote to Horace Walpole,“ The best of all our diplomatists without comparison. At last war is declared. Your Ambassador has received his recall, and perhaps leaves to-morrow. I wrote him one word. He promises to come and see me to-morrow between five and six. I own that I regret him, and have seen nothing in him that is not honest and reasonable &quot;.

== After diplomatic career ==

Stormont reached the apex of his career when he was appointed as the last Secretary of State for the Northern Department, serving from 1779 to 1782.

In 1783 he was appointed as Lord President of the Council, and again from 1794 to 1796. He served as Lord Justice General between 1778 and 1795. He was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1763 and made a Knight of the Thistle in 1768.

He purchased 56 Portland Place (later renumbered to No.37) in 1778, the largest house in the street, recently developed by his friend Duke of Portland and Robert Adam.

King George III said that he had owed Stormont a great deal, but he never rewarded him, this was noted by his friend Mary Hamilton, who said word of a prince can&#x27;t be held reliable, but a word of a King needed to be.For he had served King George III as envoy extraordinary for more than 20 years (his many letters to the King are held at The National Archives).
The 18th century hostess Elizabeth Montagu praised Stormont in 1779 saying &quot;I was very sorry when he left us, for he used to call on me often, great sense, knowledge, &amp; large acquaintance with the World make him very agreable, &amp; I love him the better for his admirable answer to ye malicious attack on Lord Sandwich.&quot;

=== Gordon Riots ===
During the Gordon riots of 1780, his uncle Lord Mansfield&#x27;s Bloomsbury Square townhouse was burned to the ground. It was reported that Lord Mansfield, Lady Mansfield and his daughter Lady Elizabeth had escaped using the back door. Lady Mansfield&#x27;s clothes were burned alongside Lord Mansfield&#x27;s precious book collection.

But it was rumored that sixty angry mobs also targeted Kenwood House next, given its close proximity to London. Stormont wrote to King George III that he had ordered light cavalry to be dispatched to Kenwood. The rioters approached Kenwood with hostile intentions, but were stalled by free ale from the nearby Spaniard’s Inn, assisted by Lord Mansfield’s steward using wine supply from the house, they successfully stalled the mob until the armed forces arrived to protect the house.

He knew not only that Kenwood House would one day be his, but also his own daughter and sisters were in dire danger, as they still remained at Kenwood. Stormont successfully saved Kenwood, his uncle beloved home from burning and looting.

=== The Great Stormont Breakfast ===
In 1783, Stormont, in compliment to the illustrious French visitors, gave the most elegant entertainment at his estate on Wandsworth Hill, above 600 admission cards were issued, 16 tents were pitched in the park. The guests assembled around 11, then the Prince of Wales arrived at two. The Duke of Chartres came with the prince, alongside the rest of foreign nobilities with the ambassadors. Amongst the guests were Duke of Fitz-James, 3rd Duke of Dorset, 4th Duke of Malborough, 4th Duke of Queensbery, Lord Cathcart, 9th Earl of Winchilsea, 5th Earl of Carlisle.

=== Second Earl of Mansfield ===
In 1793 he succeeded his uncle, William, 1st Earl of Mansfield who had died. Stormont became the 2nd Earl of Mansfield of the 1792 creation, while his wife succeeded as 2nd Countess of Mansfield of the 1776 creation, according to special remainders in the letters patent. He inherited his uncle&#x27;s Kenwood House in the London Borough of Camden and his entire wealth.

In March 1794, King George III visited Kenwood House, Queen Charlotte wrote in her diary that his majesty took his airing walk and was curious about the new architectural addition to Kenwood by his friend, the 2nd Earl of Mansfield.

=== Death ===

Lord Mansfield died in September 1796 at Brighton. In his will he had requested a simple burial wherever he died and his heart removed and taken to Scone Palace to be reunited with that of his first wife, he also requested adding latin inscriptions of &quot;Mutuique amoris perpetuo memor, Nunc demum addit suum&quot; meaning &quot;Remembering each other&#x27;s love forever and now, at last, he adds his own&quot; to their memorial at Scone Palace.

But, instead his body was laid to rest with his uncle, the 1st Earl, at Westminster Abbey with a lot of processions fit for such prominent figure. His heart was interred in Comlongon Castle. He left his eldest daughter, three paintings of her mother Henrietta that still hung in his dressing room and left all his younger children equal inheritances.

He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son David William Murray. His second son, the Honourable George Murray, became a Lieutenant-General in the Army. His fourth son, the Honourable Sir Henry Murray, rose to the rank of General.

His sister, Lady Margery said in her will, &quot;I leave amber snuff box set in gold as a token of my love and esteem for the kindest and best of brothers he will value it as having once belonged to his worthy friend.&quot; From Lord Stormont&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine:&quot; No man ever fulfilled all the relative duties of social life with more scrupulous exactness, either as a father, a husband, a brother, or a friend. His liberality was unbounded, not ostentatious indeed, but secret in the manner, and princely in the measure, as the writer of this, who knew him long and well, can vouch; not only as having been, on a very important occasion of his life, the object of it, but also as one of the channels through which it flowed, to the amount of many thousand pounds.The Countess of Mansfield survived her husband by 47 years. She went on to remarry to her first cousin the Hon. Robert Fulke Greville in 1797. Lady Mansfield died in July 1843, aged 85.

==Family==
Lord Stormont, as he was known at the time, married his wife on 16 August 1759, whilst he was British ambassador to Saxony. She was Countess Henrietta Frederica von Bünau daughter of Count Heinrich von Bünau. They had two daughters:
* Lady Elizabeth Murray (18 May 1760 – 1 June 1825); married George Finch-Hatton of Eastwell in 1785 and had issue, including George William Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea.
* Hon. Henrietta Anne Murray (16 October 1764, Dresden – circa 1765, Vienna)

Henrietta died on 10 March 1766 in Vienna. A decade later, on 5 May 1776, Stormont married secondly The Hon. Louisa Cathcart (1 June 1758 – 11 July 1843), daughter of Charles Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart and Jane Hamilton. Louisa was his junior by 30 years, she was also the niece of Sir William Hamilton, and they had five children:
* David William Murray, 3rd Earl of Mansfield (1777–1840) had issue William Murray, 4th Earl of Mansfield.
* Lieutenant-general The Hon. George Murray (1780–1848)
* Major The Hon. Charles Murray (1781–1859), who married Elizabeth Law and had children
* General Sir Henry Murray (1784–1860), who married Emily, daughter of Gerard de Vismé, and had children.
* Lady Caroline Murray (1789-1867), unmarried.
His second wife once said that she had never seen a good portrait of her husband, &quot;the drawing of me, which had many faults, you shall have a resemblance of me in some shape or the other, but as for Lord Stormont I shall not consent, for I never saw a good likeness of him&quot;.

<text>Tehrangeles () (or Little Persia) is a portmanteau deriving from the combination of &quot;Tehran&quot;, the capital of Iran, and &quot;Los Angeles&quot;. A Persian community developed in Westwood, Los Angeles after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 prompted thousands of Iranians to flee to the United States. It is a shopping, eating and gathering place for the large number (estimates range from 500,000-600,000) of Iranian-Americans and their descendants residing in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the largest such community outside of Iran. 

The intersection of Westwood Boulevard and Wilkins Avenue was recognized by the City of Los Angeles as Persian Square.

==Origin==
A Persian community originally centered in the Westwood neighborhood of the Westside in the 1960s. Immigration to the area increased several-fold due to the events surrounding the 1979 Revolution in Iran. Westwood Boulevard became known for its many Persian shops and restaurants including being a gathering place for men in restaurants and tea shops. The Iranian expatriate community of Los Angeles entered a wide variety of media including magazines, newspapers, radio, and television stations and contributed greatly to production of modern global Iranian culture while in diaspora.

==Distribution==
As the population has grown, Iranians and their American-born children have settled in neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles, including Tarzana, Woodland Hills, Encino, and Beverly Hills, as well as the cities of Irvine, Huntington Beach and elsewhere in Orange County. They have also made their homes in San Diego and the Palm Springs area of the Coachella Valley.

== Economy ==
The economy of Tehrangeles demonstrates key features of ethnic enclave economics, providing a wider range of employment opportunities than the general market by virtue of its cultural (Iranian) specificity, and as such provides a feasible method for Iranian immigrants to find employment and economic integration.

Tehrangeles is home to a sizable community of Iranian immigrant entrepreneurs who own their own businesses. Business signs are commonly in Persian, which is also spoken in the shops. Iranian-owned businesses are particularly prevalent on Westwood Boulevard between Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood to Pico Boulevard.

<text>Obliq is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language designed to make distributed, and locally multithreaded, computing simpler and easier to program, while providing program safety and an implicit type system. The interpreter is written in Modula-3, and provides Obliq with full access to Modula-3&#x27;s network objects abilities. A type inference algorithm for record concatenation, subtyping, and recursive types has been developed for Obliq. Further, it has been proved to be NP-complete
and its lowest complexity to be or if under other modeling up to certain conditions down to and its best known implementation runs in .
Obliq&#x27;s syntax is very similar to Modula-3, the biggest difference being that Obliq has no need of explicit typed variables (i.e., a variable can hold any data type allowed by the type checker and if does not accepts one, i.e., a given expression execution error will display) although explicit type declarations are allowed and ignored by the interpreter. The basic data types in the language include booleans, integers, reals, characters, strings, and arrays. Obliq supports the usual set of sequential control structures (conditional, iteration, and exception handling forms), and special control forms for concurrency (mutexes and guarded statements). Further, Obliq&#x27;s objects can be cloned and safely copied remotely by any machine in a distributed network object and it can be done safely and transparently.

Obliq&#x27;s large standard library provides strong support for mathematical operations, input/output (I/O), persistence, thread control, graphics, and animation. Distributed computing is object-based: objects hold a state, which is local to one process. Scope of objects and other variables is purely lexical. Objects can call methods of other objects, even if those objects are on another machine on the network. Obliq objects are simply collections of named fields (similar to slots in Self and Smalltalk), and support inheritance by delegation (like Self).

The common uses of Obliq involve programming over networks, 3D animation, and distributed computing, as occurs over a local area network (LAN) such as Ethernet. Obliq is included free with the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Modula-3 distribution, but other free versions exist elsewhere including precompiled binaries for several operating systems.

<text>The Avars (), also known as Maharuls&#x27; (), are a Northeast Caucasian ethnic group. The Avars are the largest of several ethnic groups living in the Russian republic of Dagestan. The Avars reside in the North Caucasus between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Alongside other ethnic groups in the North Caucasus region, the Avars live in ancient villages located approximately 2,000 meters above sea level. The Avar language spoken by the Caucasian Avars belongs to the family of Northeast Caucasian languages. Sunni Islam has been the prevailing religion of the Avars since the 14th century.

==Ethnonyms==
According to 19th-century Russian historians, the Avars&#x27; neighbors usually referred to them with the exonym Tavlins (&quot;tavlintsy&quot;). Vasily Potto wrote, &quot;The words in different languages have the same meaning... [of] mountain dwellers [or] highlanders.&quot; Potto claimed that members of Avarian tribe also often referred to themselves by the alternate endonym , also meaning &quot;mountaineer&quot;.

Most of those known as Tavlins trace their lineage to the upper parts of two tributaries of the Sulak River: the Andiyskoe Koisu and Avarskoye Koisu.

== History ==
Between the 5th and 12th centuries, Georgian Orthodox Christianity was introduced to the Avar valleys. During the Islamic conquests, Arabs invaded the Caucasus, conquering Armenia in 639 and Derbent in 643. They also founded the Emirate of Tbilisi in 736. Later, the Christian kingdom of Sarir governed much of modern-day Dagestan. The Kingdom of Georgia was also Christian. However, when Sarir fell in the early 12th century and Mongol invasions led by Subutai and Jebe weakened Georgia, Christian influence in the area ended. The Avar Khanate, a predominantly Muslim polity, succeeded Sarir. The only extant monument of Sarir architecture is the 10th-century Datuna Church in the village of Datuna. The Mongol invasions seem not to have affected the Avar territory, and the alliance with the Golden Horde enabled the Avar khans to increase their prosperity. In the 15th century the Horde declined, and the Shamkhalate of Kazi-Kumukh rose to power. The Shamkhalate absorbed the Avar Khanate.

From the 16th century onwards, the Safavids and Ottomans began expanding their territory in the Caucasus. By the mid-16th century, what is now Dagestan, eastern Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia were under Safavid rule. The area that is now western Georgia fell under Ottoman Turkish control. Although the Ottoman Turks briefly gained Dagestan during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578–1590, Dagestan and many of its Avar inhabitants stayed under Safavid suzerainty for many centuries. Despite Safavid rule, many ethnic groups in Dagestan, including many Avars, retained relatively high amounts of freedom and self-governance.

After the Russo-Persian War of 1722–1723, Russia briefly took Dagestan from the Safavids. The Afsharids reestablished full control over the Caucasus again in the early 18th century under Nader Shah&#x27;s Caucasus campaign and Dagestan campaign. During that same time, the Avars routed one of Nader Shah&#x27;s armies at Andalal during the later stages of his Dagestan campaign. In the wake of this triumph, Umma Khan of the Avars (reigned 1774–1801) managed to extract tribute from most states of the Caucasus, including Shirvan and Georgia.
Umma Khan died in 1801. Two years later, the khanate voluntarily submitted to Russian authority following the Russian annexation of Georgia and the Treaty of Georgievsk. This was only confirmed after considerable Russian successes and the victory in the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813, after which Persia lost southern Dagestan and many of its other Caucasian territories to Russia. The 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay indefinitely consolidated Russian control over Dagestan and other areas where the Avars lived.

The Russians instituted heavy taxes, expropriated estates, and constructed fortresses in the Avar region. The Avar population revolted under the flag of the Muslim Imamate of Dagestan. Ghazi Mohammed (1828–1832), Hamzat Bek (1832–1834), and Shamil (1834–1859) led the revolts.

This Caucasian War raged until 1864, when the Avarian Khanate was abolished and replaced by the Avarian District. Some Avars refused to collaborate with Russians and migrated to Turkey, where their descendants live to this day. Despite war and emigration, the Avars retained their position as the dominant ethnic group in Dagestan during the Soviet period. After World War II, many Avars left the barren highlands for the fertile plains closer to the shores of the Caspian Sea.

== Description ==
The Avarians are a Northeast Caucasian people who speak Avar, a Northeast Caucasian language. According to &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, the Turanian nomads also share the name Avar. The Encyclopedia Britannica describes the Turanian nomads as &quot;a people of undetermined origin and language.&quot;

As of 2002, the Avarians numbered about 1.04 million. 912,020 Avarians lived in Russia during the 2010 census; 850,011 of them lived in Dagestan. Only 32% lived in cities. Avarians inhabit most of the mountainous part of Dagestan as well the plains (Buynaksk, Khasavyurt, Kizilyurt and other regions). Outside of Dagestan, Russian Avars also live in Chechnya and Kalmykia.

As of 1999, 50,900 Avarians lived in the Balakan and Zakatala rayons of Azerbaijan. The Avarian population of Azerbaijan had decreased to 49,800 by 2009. In 2002, 1,996 Kvareli Avars lived in Georgia.

In Turkey, Avarians are considered &quot;ethnic Turks&quot;, and so aren&#x27;t counted as their own ethnic group on the census. This makes it difficult to know exactly how many Avarians live in Turkey. According to Ataev B.M., who referenced A.M. Magomeddadaev&#x27;s research, the Avarian population there should have been around 53,000 in 2005.

== Ethnic groups ==

Avarian is a collective term; among the Avarians there are around 15 sub-ethnic groups, including the Avar, Andi, and Tsez (Dido) peoples.
== Genetics==

According to genetic studies in 2023, the following haplogroups are found to predominate among Avars:

* J1 (60%)

* R1b (15%)

* G2 (12%)

* J2 (6%)

* L (2%)

== Avarians as highlanders and armed people ==
, transliterated as means &quot;inhabitants of the top grounds, mountaineers.&quot; Another group of Avarians is described as belonging to a different category, ( with a soft &quot;χ&quot;). This term means &quot;inhabitants of plains (warm valleys) and gardeners&quot;.

The name &quot;Avarians&quot; has a narrower meaning; it has a national meaning connected with former statehood. &quot;Avar&quot; is a significant part of the word &quot;Avaria,&quot; which refers to the Khunzakh Khanate. The Khanate formed in the 12th century after the disintegration of Sarir. From the middle of the 19th century, this territory was the Avarian District of the Daghestan area. This area is now referred to as Khunzakhsky District of Dagestan. Khunzakhsky District is referred to as in literary Avarian and in a local dialect.

The modern literary language of Avarias (), both in the past and today, is known among Avarians as the language of (). The Avarian word means &quot;army, armed people.&quot; According to reconstructions, this word descends from in the proto-Avarian language (&quot;ʔ&quot; represents a glottal stop).

== Names for the Avars ==

In modern Avarian, three words retain the ancient basis of . They include , meaning &quot;envoy, prophet, messiah&quot;; , meaning &quot;pommel of a saddle&quot;; and , meaning &quot;obstacle, opposition&quot;. means &quot;to make an obstacle, to resist.&quot; There is also an Avarian river called in Avarian and in Russian.

All three listed words are found in ancient lexicons of the Iranian languages. The Parthian word and the Middle Persian word both mean &quot;up, on, over&quot; and &quot;higher, superior.&quot; The Middle Persian word means &quot;acclivity,&quot; or uphill slope. Similar Middle Persian words include , meaning &quot;superior&quot;; , meaning &quot;god, divinity&quot;; , meaning &quot;noble&quot;; , meaning &quot;to surpass&quot;, and , meaning &quot;to attack&quot;.

At the same time, according to the morphology of the Middle Persian language, the word , meaning &quot;superior&quot; can also be translated as &quot;Aβarian&quot;, &quot;Khurasanian&quot;, and &quot;Parthian&quot; as seen, for example, in a Middle Persian word, , meaning &quot;Iranian&quot;.

The first known use of the term &quot;Avar&quot; was in the 10th century. According to Persian author Ibn Rustah, a so-called governor of Sarir, Johannes de Galonifontibus was the first person to write about Avars under the name &quot;Avar.&quot; He wrote in 1404 that &quot;Circassians, Leks, Yasses, Alans, Avars, [and] Kazikumukhs&quot; live in the Caucasus. According to Vladimir Minorsky, one account from 1424 called the Daghestanian Avars the Auhar.

Azerbaijani writer Abbasgulu Bakikhanov wrote that the &quot;inhabitants of vicinities of Agran have been moved here from Khurasan. A residence of this emir also was Agran&quot;. The editor of this book, an academician of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan, Z.M. Buniyatov, confirms that this &quot;Agran&quot; corresponds to the Avar Khanate.

The word &quot;Agran&quot; is unknown to modern Avars. According to the &quot;Altiranisches Wörterbuch,&quot; written by Christian Bartholomae, &quot;agra&quot; means in his language, German. This corresponds to &quot;first, upper, beginning, tip&quot; in English. He also wrote that &quot;agra&#x27;va&quot; meant in German, which translates to &quot;from the top, coming from the upper side.&quot;

Nöldeke, Hübschmann, Frye, Christensen and Enoki identify Aparshahr/Abarshahr/Abharshahr/Abrashahr with Khurasan, a historical region of Iran, or with Nishapur, an Iranian city. The Khurasan () in Iranian studies is known as &quot;rise of Sun.&quot; The Parthian word (Middle Persian , meaning &quot;up, on, over&quot;) and Parthian/Middle Persian are cognate with Old Iranian , which means &quot;empire, power, the sovereign house.&quot;) In summary, Aparšahr/Aβaršahr is very similar to the German word . According to historian H.W. Haussig, Aβaršahr means (&quot;Kingdom of the Abar&quot;) and should be sought in the south-western territory of the Western Turkic Khaganate.

A Dahae tribe, the Aparnak (Parni) moved from the south-eastern shore of the Caspian Sea (part of modern Turkmenistan), into the territory of Khurasan, where they founded a confederation of Dahae tribes that Avestani texts referred to as &quot;barbarians&quot; and &quot;enemies of Aryans,&quot; according to Christian Bartholomae.

On the border of Khurasan, the Sassanid Persians built a strong wall, named the &quot;Great Wall of Gorgan&quot; or &quot;The Red Snake.&quot; The wall was built to protect Iran from invasion by the White Huns (Hepthalites; called Khionites, X&#x27;iiaona and Xyôn in Zoroastrian texts). Later another wave of White Huns conquered Khurasan and occupied it for a long time. According to Richard Helli: &quot;By such reasoning, the Ephthalites are thought to have originated at Hsi-mo-ta-lo (southwest of Badakhshan and near the Hindu Kush), which tantalizingly, stands for Himtala, &#x27;snow plain&#x27;, which may be the Sanskritized form of Hephthal.&quot; In 484, the Hephthalite chief Akhshunwar led his army to attack the Sassanian King Peroz I, who was defeated and killed in Khurasan. After the victory, the Hephthalite empire extended to Merv and Herat. Some of the White Huns drew up a peace treaty with Iran and the two became allies, both fighting against the Byzantine Empire. Thus, Hephthalites lived in the Khurasan/Khorasan area. According to the Chinese classic Liang chih-kung-t&#x27;u, (pinyin: ) was the name the Hephthalites used for themselves, and that is probably a Chinese transfer of a similar-sounding word, war/Uar.

Mehmed Tezcan writes that according to a Chinese record, the Hephthalites descended from a Rouran tribe called Hua in the Qeshi region (near Turpan). This tribe came to Tokharistan and soon settled also in eastern regions of Khorasan at the beginning of the 5th century. About the same time, the name Avars/Awards appears in the sources. Again, in his well-known Atlas of China, A. Herrmann shows the eastern regions of Khorasan, Tokharistan, etc. as the dominions of Afu/Hua/Awards/Hephthalites between ca. 440 and 500 A.D., relying on the identification Hua = Uar = Awar.

The German researcher Karl Heinrich Menges considered Eurasian Avars to be one of the ancient Mongol peoples, who &quot;were the first to use the title ga gan (later qān, ḵān) for their supreme ruler.&quot; He describes the &quot;traces of a Mongol residue in Daghestan&quot;. Supporters of the so-called old Turanian nomad horde &quot;infiltrate&quot; point of view (with various clauses) include the following scientists: Josef Markwart, Omeljan Pritsak, Vladimir Minorsky, Vladimir Baileys, Harald Haarmann, Murad Gadjievich Magomedov, Alikber Alikberov, and Timur Aytberov.

== Language ==

The Avar language belongs to the Avar-Andi-Tsez subgroup of the Northeast Caucasian (or Nakh–Dagestanian) language family. The writing is based on the Cyrillic script, which replaced the Arabic script used before 1927 and the Latin script used between 1927 and 1938. More than 60% of the Avars living in Dagestan speak Russian as their second language.

== Notable Avars ==
* Imam Shamil, resistance leader during the Caucasian War
* Ghazi Muhammad, Islamic scholar
* Hamzat Bek, imam
* Rasul Gamzatov, poet
* Hadji Murad, military leader during the Caucasian War, waged by of the peoples of Dagestan and Chechnya from 1811–1864 against the Russian Empire. He was also a rival to Imam Shamil.

<doc id="602584" wikidata="Q926640" url="?curid=602584" title="Wet and messy fetishism">
<text>Wet and messy fetishism (WAM), also known as sploshing, is a form of sexual fetishism consisting of a person or persons getting messy with a variety of materials, such as food, mud, chemicals, and water. The word &quot;sploshing&quot; originates from a defunct UK fetish magazine named &quot;Splosh!&quot;.

==Overview==
Many people with WAM fetishes are drawn to the tactile sensations of wet or messy substances against their skin. Other individuals simply prefer the visual appeal of others getting wet or messy with products that have different textures, consistencies and colours. A subject will often be pelted with cream pies (sometimes using shaving foam rather than real cream pie filling), have slime dumped on them, or sit on cakes. Another common theme is the pouring of substances inside clothing while it is being worn; clothing chosen for this can vary from swimsuits or underwear to full outfits. Normal street clothes, either casual or office wear, are commonly featured in WAM productions, but many other types of outfits, from wedding attire to industrial overalls or more specialist fetishwear such as PVC, latex, or leather items may be used. White items are particularly popular with some fans of this fetish.

There is a wide variety of messy substances associated with WAM. Popular food items include cakes, pies, whipped cream, raw eggs, milk, pudding, syrups, honey, custard, baked beans, pasta, soups, treacle, condiments, ice cream, peanut butter, cake batter and oatmeal. Non-food items like lotion (see lotion play), paint, oil, mud, shaving foam, hair conditioner, soap, and slime are also widely used.

A fetish for bodily fluids such as feces, urine, vomit, semen, and female ejaculate is not considered part of WAM. The former three are typically considered urophilia, emetophilia, and coprophilia; urophilia is occasionally found in mainstream the other two are less common fetishes.pornography;

WAM fetish videos (made by both fans and commercial producers) may include nudity and sexual acts, while others may only feature fully clothed participants. Videos can frequently be seen on public video hosting sites like YouTube. Some of these videos are flagged but most of them remain available despite the sexual undertones, mainly because a large majority of wet and messy videos posted publicly do not include nudity and are therefore considered suitable for all audiences to view. Indeed, not only is much WAM video content indistinguishable in any easily defined sense from the kind of slapstick featured in mainstream entertainment, but scenes of slimings or pieings from the mainstream media are often compiled and marketed by producers towards a WAM fetishist target audience.

==Crossover with other fetishes==
There is some crossover between the wet and messy fetish and clothing destruction fetishes. Some WAM productions will see models start out fully dressed, usually in quite smart outfits such as formal dresses or suits; they will then be covered in messy substances, after which their messy clothes are cut up, typically with scissors, leaving them naked or nearly so.

WAM may be an add-on for people who already have a fetish for specific types of clothing, where getting the clothes they are already excited by messy, or wet by showering or bathing in them, adds an extra layer to the experience of wearing them.

WAM is sometimes also combined with bondage, where a subject is first restrained or chained up and then has a bucket of green cake batter slime poured over their head and/or a pie smashed in their face. Wet and Messy fetishism lends itself well to domination/submission role-playing.

&quot;Cake sitting&quot; (the act of deliberately sitting on a large cake, either clothed or nude) is often considered a sub-fetish in its own right, but may be linked to the crush fetish. While participants who sit on cakes for pleasure will do so for the tactile sensory experience, or as part of submissive role-playing, those who enjoy watching the act will often focus specifically on the crushing of the dessert as a visual stimulus for a sexual reaction. Cake sitting as a fully clothed WAM activity can also form just part of the overall messing up of a participant, along with other methods of application of messy substances.

==Psychology==
No conclusive research has been conducted into the psychology behind the fetish; however, it is not uncommon for fetishists to have had interest in the sensations of messy play since their formative years (age 3–4) with a sexual element manifesting at the onset of puberty. The &quot;breaking taboos&quot; theory suggests sploshing is an expression of liberation, pushing back against childhood authority figures who emphasized staying clean. In any form, the fetish is about sensual stimulation, whether visual, tactile, or otherwise.

One unproven theory is that individuals drawn to WAM have low tactile sensitivity, which is increased and intensified by wet substances acting as a lubricant under applied pressure or friction. &quot;Messy play&quot; is a common clinical therapy used in treating hypo-tactile patients (mostly pediatric cases) to give them an outlet and appropriate time and place to engage in mess-making.

Another aspect is the link to other fetishes, as some wet and messy play is done in a submissive or dominating way and has possible links to BDSM, the emphasis being on the humiliation of the victim, although this is often mitigated or negated by the victim taking it in good humour. The dominant partner inflicting the mess can also be an object of attraction as an assertive figure of playful mischief.

==In media==
The popular sex column &quot;Savage Love&quot; has mentioned WAM. In one article, there was a reply to a letter from the roommate of someone who masturbates with condiments, possibly for fetishistic purposes. Dan Savage, the writer of &quot;Savage Love,&quot; did not condemn the use of condiments in that incident, but, instead, only chided the fetishist for using condiments that were later used by others.

<doc id="602598" wikidata="Q5339517" url="?curid=602598" title="Edmund Gurney">
<text>Edmund Gurney (23 March 184723 June 1888) was an English psychologist and parapsychologist. At the time the term for research of paranormal activities was &quot;psychical research&quot;.

==Early life==

Gurney was born at Hersham, near Walton-on-Thames. He was educated at Blackheath and at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1866, where he took fourth place in the classical tripos and obtained a fellowship in 1872. His work for the tripos was done, said his friend F. W. H. Myers, in the intervals of his practice on the piano. Dissatisfied with his own executive skill as a musician, he wrote &quot;The Power of Sound&quot; (1880), an essay on the philosophy of music.

He then studied medicine with no intention of practising, devoting himself to physics, chemistry and physiology. In 1880 he passed the second M.B. Cambridge (medical science). In 1881 he began the study of law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

In relation to psychical research, he asked whether there is an unexplored region of human faculty transcending the normal limitations of sensible knowledge. Gurney&#x27;s purpose was to approach the subject by observation and experiment, especially in the hypnotism field. He wanted to investigate the persistence of the conscious human personality after the death of the body. Three of his sisters died when their barge overturned in the Nile River during a tour of Egypt in 1875, profoundly affecting him, and his research was partially fueled by a desire to find some meaning to their deaths.

==Experimental work==

Gurney began at what he later saw was the wrong end by studying, with Myers, the séances of professed spiritualistic mediums (1874–1878). Little but detection of imposture came of this. In 1882 the Society for Psychical Research was founded. Paid mediums were discarded, at least for the time, and experiments were made in thought-transference and hypnotism. Personal evidence as to uninduced hallucinations was also collected.

The first results are embodied in the volumes of &quot;Phantasms of the Living&quot;, a vast collection (Frank Podmore, Myers and Gurney), and in Gurney&#x27;s essay, &quot;Hallucinations&quot;. Evidence for the process called telepathy was supposed to be established by the experiments chronicled in the &quot;Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;, and it was argued that similar experiences occurred spontaneously, as, for example, in the many recorded instances of deathbed wraiths. The dying man was supposed to convey the hallucination of his presence as one living person experimentally conveys his thought to another, by thought-transference.

Gurney&#x27;s hypnotic experiments were undertaken in the years 1885 to 1888. Their tendency was, in Myers&#x27;s view, to prove that there is sometimes, in the induction of hypnotic phenomena, some agency at work which is neither ordinary nervous stimulation nor suggestion conveyed by any ordinary channel to the subject&#x27;s mind. These results, if accepted, would corroborate the idea of telepathy. Experiments by Joseph Gibert, Paul Janet, Charles Richet, Méricourt and others were cited as tending in the same direction.

Other experiments dealt with the relation of the memory in the hypnotic state to the memory in another hypnotic state, and of both to the normal memory. Gurney&#x27;s research into psychic matters was respected by contemporaries. However, it has since then been argued to be deeply flawed: Gurney trusted in the assistance of one George Albert Smith, a theatrical performer and producer. Smith was the one handling the actual experiments into telepathy, hypnotism, and the rest, and Gurney fully accepted his results. According to Trevor Hall in his study &quot;The Strange Case of Edmund Gurney&quot;, in the spring of 1888 Gurney discovered that Smith had used his knowledge of theatrical trickery and stage illusion to fake tests and results; so that the value of the tests (with which Gurney was building up his reputation) were worthless. Douglas Blackburn, Smith&#x27;s principal partner in the mentalist performances and experiments, publicly admitted fraud in 1908 and again in 1911, although Smith denied it.

==Death==
He died at Brighton on 23 June 1888, from the effects of an overdose of chloroform. At the inquest, Arthur Thomas Myers, the brother of F.W.H. Myers, testified to having prescribed chloroform for neuralgia, and a verdict of accidental death was recorded. It was widely thought at the time that Gurney might have committed suicide, and Alice James recorded this in her diary. 

Trevor Hall has argued the case that Gurney&#x27;s death was suicide, resulting from disillusionment after discovering the frauds of Blackburn and Smith. Gordon Epperson argues against this hypothesis and Janet Oppenheim concludes that &quot;the mystery is not likely to be resolved&quot;.

Following the death of Gurney, William James in a letter to George Croom Robertson dated Aug,1888, made a heartfelt tribute to Gurney. 
&quot;Poor Edmund Gurney! How I shall miss that man&#x27;s presence in the world. I think, to compare small things with great, that there was a very unusual sort of affinity between my mind and his. Our problems were the same, and for the most part our solutions. I eagerly devoured every word he wrote, and was always conscious of him as critic and judge. He had both quantity and quality, and I hoped for some big philosophic achievement from him ere he should get through. And now — omnia ademit una dies infesta — The world is grown hollower.&quot; 
==Works==
In addition to his work on music and his psychological writings, he was the author of &quot;Tertium Quid&quot; (1887), a collection of essays, the title a protest against one-sided ideas and methods of discussion.

==Personal life==
In 1877 Gurney married Kate Sara Sibley. They had one daughter, Helen, born in 1881. After Gurney&#x27;s death, Kate married Archibald Grove, a journalist and politician, in 1889.

<text>&#x27; (; singular Maultasche&quot;&quot;&#x27; , ) are a kind of large meat-filled dumpling in Swabian cuisine. They consist of sheets of pasta dough filled with minced meat, smoked meat, spinach, bread crumbs and onions and flavored with various herbs and spices (e.g. pepper, parsley and nutmeg). are typically across. They are square or rectangular in shape.

On 22 October 2009, the European Union recognized (&#x27; or&#x27;) as a &#x27;Protected Geographical Indication (PGI)&#x27; and remarked that the dish is significant to the cultural heritage of Baden-Württemberg. This measure provides protection to the integrity of the dish, mandating that genuine are only produced in Swabia, a historical region that was incorporated into the modern German states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria.

==History==
In Swabia, are the traditional dish associated with the Lenten commemoration of Maundy Thursday and Good Friday. During Lent, Catholics and other Christians are encouraged to refrain from eating meat. However, are humorously associated with these days because the meat in the dish is concealed under the pasta dough and cannot be seen by God. Among the anecdotal stories regarding the origin of the dish, one claims that were created by the Cistercian monks of Maulbronn Abbey for that purpose. A Swabian German nickname for the dish, &quot;&quot;, means &quot;God-cheaters&quot;.

One of the earliest mentions of the name is associated with several recipes in a 1794 cookbook—however, these are recipes for sweet preparations, and not a savory meat-filled entree.

The name is a compound word and could derive from three possible meanings: The first being that &#x27; comes from the combination of the noun &#x27; referring to the mouth of an animal and &#x27;, which means &quot;pocket&quot; or &quot;bag.&quot; Thus, literally would mean &quot;feedbag&quot;—as in a bag used for feeding livestock—and probably derives this name from its appearance. In Swiss dialects &quot;Mul&quot; or &quot;Mu&quot; also just means &quot;mouth&quot; (despite its meaning of &quot;mouth of an animal&quot; in the standard language.) the same could be the case in Swabia, since they also speak an Alemannic dialect, just as the Swiss do. The second meaning could be that from an archaic word — either &#x27; or &#x27;—for a &quot;slap in the face.&quot; If this were its origins, the name could be a comparison between a swollen cheek after being slapped with the shape and appearance of the dish. The third explanation might be just a reference to Maulbronn Abbey and be short for &#x27;.

==Preparation==
 are traditionally prepared in two ways, either:
* &quot; (simmered in broth and served like a soup),
* &quot; (dressed with butter and onions).

Some recipes for use bacon for the meat filling.

Some German descendants in Southwest Wisconsin (USA) make a dessert of the same name, due to its visual similarities to the sliced dinner version. Its ingredients include flour, eggs, apples and cinnamon.

<text>WBRE-TV (channel 28) is a television station licensed to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, United States, serving Northeastern Pennsylvania as an affiliate of NBC. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group, which provides certain services to Scranton-licensed CBS affiliate WYOU (channel 22) under a shared services agreement (SSA) with Mission Broadcasting. The two stations share studios on South Franklin Street in downtown Wilkes-Barre, with a news bureau and sales office next to WYOU&#x27;s former studios on Lackawanna Avenue in downtown Scranton. WBRE-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located at the Penobscot Knob antenna farm near Mountain Top.

WBRE-TV operates a digital replacement translator on UHF channel 28 that is licensed to Waymart with a transmitter in Forest City. It exists because wind turbines run by NextEra Energy Resources at the Waymart Wind Farm interfere with the transmission of full-power television signals.

==History==
WBRE signed on New Year&#x27;s Day 1953 becoming the first television station in the market. It was owned by the Baltimore family along with WBRE radio (1340 AM, now WYCK, and 98.5 FM, now WKRZ). Although it appears that the call letters stand for Wilkes-Barre, they actually refer to Baltimore Radio Exchange, the Baltimore family&#x27;s company. The radio stations were sold off in 1980.

For much of its early history, channel 28 was unable to get a direct feed from NBC because AT&amp;T microwave and wireline operations weren&#x27;t available in northeast Pennsylvania. Station engineers were thus forced to switch to and from the signals of network flagship WNBT in New York City (now WNBC) and WPTZ in Philadelphia (now CBS owned-and-operated station KYW-TV) when NBC programming was airing. WPTZ was used as a backup. In efforts to improve the quality and reliability of the received signals, WBRE built its own relay site on Pimple Hill on the west side of Route 115, just south of Pocono Raceway. Reception of the New York stations is very clear and reliable from that site; indeed, it served as a microwave retransmission site for many of the area&#x27;s cable systems well into the 1990s until fiber optics made microwave transmission obsolete.

In 1972, disaster struck at WBRE when its offices were flooded by Hurricane Agnes. Most of the station&#x27;s equipment was moved above ground and survived but a film archive in the basement was destroyed. The Baltimore family sold the radio stations in 1980, but held onto channel 28 until selling it to New York–based Northeastern Television Investors in 1984, earning a handsome return on their original investment in WBRE radio in 1925. Current owner Nexstar Broadcasting Group acquired the station in 1997. Nexstar already owned WYOU but opted to keep WBRE and sold WYOU to Mission Broadcasting. However, Nexstar continues to control WYOU&#x27;s operations through a joint sales agreement. On January 3, 2007, Nexstar named Louis J. Abitabilo as vice president and general manager for the two stations.

The station&#x27;s news operation made a fictional appearance within the NBC comedy series &quot;The Office&quot;, set in Scranton, in the 6th-season episodes &quot;The Chump&quot; and &quot;Whistleblower&quot;, interviewing Michael Scott about reports of malfunctioning printers.

In September 2011, the station was evacuated once again due to potential flooding by heavy rains from Tropical Storm Lee. For 48 hours, the station operated remotely out of the garage of the local Fox affiliate, WOLF-TV. They provided coverage for the entire duration of the evacuation period, nearly 63 hours. Luckily, the station and the majority of the city of Wilkes-Barre were protected by the levee system.

On January 19, 2012, Nexstar named Robert G. Bee as vice president and general manager of WBRE, with management responsibilities for WYOU. The station went full HD including news and production on April 2, 2012.

In 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire Tribune Media. Tribune had been the operator of ABC affiliate WNEP-TV through a services agreement since 2014. Nexstar elected to retain WBRE, as well as its agreement to operate WYOU, and sold WNEP-TV to Tegna Inc. in 2019.

==News operation==
WBRE led the ratings for most of the 1950s until WNEP-TV jumped ahead in 1959. During the 1950s and 1960s, mirroring the century-long rivalry between Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, WBRE ruled Wilkes-Barre while WDAU-TV (now WYOU) dominated Scranton. Channel 28 jumped back in the lead in the early-1960s and went back and forth for first place with WDAU until 1978 when WNEP took the lead. It fell to third for most of the 1980s, even with NBC&#x27;s powerhouse prime time lineup. In the mid-1990s, the station briefly surpassed long-dominant WNEP, then fell again to second after the sale to Nexstar.

In 2002, WBRE and WYOU dropped their separate weekday morning and noon newscasts in favor of &quot;Pennsylvania Morning&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania Midday&quot; which were jointly-produced and simulcast on both stations. Since the two have both trailed WNEP in the news ratings by a wide margin for most of the last thirty years, a major shakeup in format occurred in fall 2006. While WYOU went with a talk/debate format for its weeknight shows, &quot;WBRE News&quot; became more of the traditional news program. This set a more clear competition against WNEP. At the beginning of 2008, WYOU dropped the weekday shared productions and started airing the first hour of the nationally syndicated morning show &quot;The Daily Buzz&quot; at 6 while debuting its own noon news.

On June 9, 2008, there were several more changes made on the two stations. WBRE re-launched its news operation as &quot;WBRE Eyewitness News&quot;. It had previously used the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; moniker from the mid-1980s until 2001. This coincided with news set, music package, graphics, and weather system upgrades. There were also some on-air personnel changes. Anchor Andy Mehalshick became a weeknight field anchor. Candice Kelly, who had been anchoring on WYOU, moved to the weeknight newscasts on WBRE back in mid-May and was joined by newcomer Drew Speier. In addition, WBRE and WYOU&#x27;s midday shows switched anchors. Mark Hiller moved from WBRE to WYOU while Eva Mastromatteo switched over to this station. Hiller also debuted as anchor of &quot;WYOU News First at 4&quot; on weeknights. That station became the first in the area to broadcast local news at that time. This was followed at 4:30 by &quot;The Insider&quot; which moved from its 7 o&#x27;clock slot. WYOU then dropped its 5 p.m. newscast and aired two episodes of &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. Finally weeknights at 6 o&#x27;clock, Lyndall Stout (who anchored on WBRE) joined Eric Scheiner for the half-hour &quot;WYOU Inter@ctive&quot;. That station also launched a new weeknight newscast, &quot;WYOU News at 7&quot;. WNEP already aired local news at that time on weeknights. All of the preceding changes were an attempt to better compete against WNEP and get more ratings.

On April 4, 2009, WYOU shut down its news operation resulting in the layoff of fourteen personnel while others were integrated with WBRE. Syndicated programming began airing in place of the newscasts. The station saved nearly $1 million a year as a result of closing down its news department.

Fox affiliate WOLF-TV (channel 56) dropped WNEP as their news supplier at the end of 2009. WOLF then went to WBRE to take over starting January 1, 2010. WBRE then took over production of nightly prime time broadcasts on WOLF-TV which expanded to an hour and were re-branded as &quot;Fox 56 News First at 10&quot;.

WBRE launched a new 4 p.m. show called &quot;PA Live!&quot; in the fall of 2011. It focuses on lifestyles news covering the greater Wilkes-Barre and Scranton area. Along with its main studios, WBRE operates four news bureaus: Scranton (on Lackawanna Avenue), Stroudsburg (Main Street), Williamsport (on Pine Street), and Hazleton (East 10th Street).

On April 2, 2012, WBRE began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition, with a new news set, HD cameras and forecasting equipment. With the upgrade, the station began producing half-hour newscasts at noon and 7 p.m. on sister station WYOU, the first such newscasts on that station since WYOU&#x27;s in-house news department folded in 2009; those newscasts are also broadcast in high definition; in addition, simulcasts of WBRE&#x27;s weekday morning, and nightly 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts are also carried on WYOU. This is a similar operation to existing joint news operations formed by Nexstar/Mission stations the year prior, between WUTR and WFXV in Utica, New York, and WTVW and WEHT in Evansville, Indiana.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
On June 15, 2016, Nexstar announced that it has entered into an affiliation agreement with Katz Broadcasting for the Escape, Laff, Grit, and Bounce TV networks (the last one of which is owned by Bounce Media LLC, whose COO Jonathan Katz is president/CEO of Katz Broadcasting), bringing the four networks to 81 stations owned and/or operated by Nexstar, including WBRE-TV and WYOU.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WBRE-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 28, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition VHF channel 11, using virtual channel 28.

Like other stations in the area, WBRE was forced to rely on repeaters to serve its coverage area for most of its history. The market is one of the largest (in land area) east of the Mississippi River and is very mountainous. In addition, Scranton–Wilkes-Barre was a &quot;UHF island&quot; before the digital transition because it is too close to Philadelphia and New York City for VHF analog service. During March 2010, in a cost-cutting move, all owned and operated translators were shut down after Nexstar determined that its VHF signal for WBRE is adequate enough to reach most of the market. VHF signals &quot;bend&quot; over rugged terrain more easily than UHF signals. According to nepahdtv.com, this move was met with some dismay from viewers in areas where reception of signals from Penobscot Knob is difficult if not impossible, leaving many people in rural areas unable to watch the station. Many of these areas are among the few in the country where cable and satellite are not readily available. Despite this, no effort from Nexstar has been made to bring back any of the repeaters.

==Out-of-market cable coverage==
In New York State, WBRE is carried on Charter Spectrum in Monticello in Sullivan County, which is part of the New York City market.

===As fill-in for other NBC affiliates during disputes===
* During a retransmission dispute involving Smith Media station WKTV, WBRE-TV was seen on Time Warner Cable in the Utica area from December 16, 2010, until January 8, 2011.
* At 11:59 a.m. on June 10, 2012, Time Warner Cable began broadcasting WBRE&#x27;s programming in the Upstate NY region during a re-transmission dispute involving WPTZ, a station in Plattsburgh, New York, owned by Hearst Television.
* On July 9, 2012, the dispute between Time Warner Cable and Hearst extended to other TWC systems; on TWC systems in the Piedmont Triad and Bright House Networks systems in Central Florida, WXII-TV and WESH, respectively, was replaced with WBRE; TWC and Bright House opted for such a distant signal like WBRE, as they do not have the rights to carry any NBC affiliate closest to them. However, Nexstar complained that Time Warner Cable has used their signals outside their markets without permission, while Time Warner Cable was within its rights to use their signals as replacements until a deal with Hearst is reached. The substitution of WBRE in place of WPTZ, WESH and WXII lasted until July 19, 2012, when the deal was reached between Hearst and TWC.

<doc id="602616" wikidata="Q1200977" url="?curid=602616" title="Quaternary sector of the economy">
<text>The quaternary sector of the economy is based upon the economic activity that is associated with either the intellectual or knowledge-based economy. This consists of information technology; media; research and development; information-based services such as information-generation and information-sharing; and knowledge-based services such as consultation, entertainment, broadcasting, mass media, telecommunication, education, information technology, financial planning, blogging, and designing.
Other definitions describe the quaternary sector as pure services. This may consist of the entertainment industry, to describe media and culture, and government. This may be classified into an additional quinary sector.

The term reflects the analysis of the three-sector model of the economy, in which the primary sector produces raw materials used by the secondary sector to produce goods, which are then distributed to consumers by the tertiary sector.

Contrary to this implied sequence, however, the quaternary sector does not process the output of the tertiary sector. It has only limited and indirect connections to the industrial economy characterized by the three-sector model. 

In a modern economy, the generation, analysis and dissemination of information is important enough to warrant a separate sector instead of being a part of the tertiary sector. This sector evolves in well-developed countries where the primary and secondary sectors are a minority of the economy, and requires a highly educated workforce.

For example, the tertiary and quaternary sectors form the largest part of the UK economy, employing 76% of the workforce.

<doc id="602618" wikidata="Q24721374" url="?curid=602618" title="Arginase">
<text>Arginase (, &quot;arginine amidinase&quot;, &quot;canavanase&quot;, &quot;L-arginase&quot;, &quot;arginine transamidinase&quot;) is a manganese-containing enzyme. The reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is:
: arginine + H2O → ornithine + urea
It is the final enzyme of the urea cycle. It is ubiquitous to all domains of life.

== Structure and function ==
Arginase belongs to the ureohydrolase family of enzymes.

Arginase catalyzes the fifth and final step in the urea cycle, a series of biochemical reactions in mammals during which the body disposes of harmful ammonia. Specifically, arginase converts L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea. Mammalian arginase is active as a trimer, but some bacterial arginases are hexameric. The enzyme requires a two-molecule metal cluster of manganese in order to maintain proper function. These Mn2+ ions coordinate with water, orienting and stabilizing the molecule and allowing water to act as a nucleophile and attack L-arginine, hydrolyzing it into ornithine and urea.

In most mammals, two isozymes of this enzyme exist; the first, Arginase I, functions in the urea cycle, and is located primarily in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes (liver cells). The second isozyme, Arginase II, has been implicated in the regulation of intracellular arginine/ornithine levels. It is located in mitochondria of several tissues in the body, with most abundance in the kidney and prostate. It may be found at lower levels in macrophages, lactating mammary glands, and brain. The second isozyme may be found in the absence of other urea cycle enzymes.

== Mechanism ==

The active site holds L-arginine in place via hydrogen bonding between the guanidine group with Glu227. This bonding orients L-arginine for nucleophilic attack by the metal-associated hydroxide ion at the guanidine group. This results in a tetrahedral intermediate. The manganese ions act to stabilize both the hydroxyl group in the tetrahedral intermediate, as well as the developing sp3 lone electron pair on the NH2 group as the tetrahedral intermediate is formed.

Arginase&#x27;s active site is extraordinarily specific. Modifying the substrate structure and/or stereochemistry severely lowers the kinetic activity of the enzyme. This specificity occurs due to the high number of hydrogen bonds between substrate and enzyme; direct or water-facilitated hydrogen bonds exist, saturating both the four acceptor positions on the alpha carboxylate group and all three positions on the alpha amino group. N-hydroxy-L-arginine (NOHA), an intermediate of NO biosynthesis, is a moderate inhibitor of arginase. Crystal structure of its complex with the enzyme reveals that it displaces the metal-bridging hydroxide ion and bridges the binuclear manganese cluster.

Additionally, 2(S)-amino-6-boronohexonic acid (ABH) is an L-arginine analogue that also creates a tetrahedral intermediate similar to that formed in the catalysis of the natural substrate, and is a potent inhibitor of human arginase I.

== Role in sexual response ==

Arginase II is coexpressed with nitric oxide (NO) synthase in smooth muscle tissue, such as the muscle in the genitals of both men and women. The contraction and relaxation of these muscles has been attributed to NO synthase, which causes rapid relaxation of smooth muscle tissue and facilitates engorgement of tissue necessary for normal sexual response. However, since NO synthase and arginase compete for the same substrate (L-arginine), over-expressed arginase can affect NO synthase activity and NO-dependent smooth muscle relaxation by depleting the substrate pool of L-arginine that would otherwise be available to NO synthase. In contrast, inhibiting arginase with ABH or other boronic acid inhibitors will maintain normal cellular levels of arginine, thus allowing for normal muscle relaxation and sexual response.

Arginase is a controlling factor in both male erectile function and female sexual arousal, and is therefore a potential target for treatment of sexual dysfunction in both sexes. Additionally, supplementing the diet with additional L-arginine will decrease the amount of competition between arginase and NO synthase by providing extra substrate for each enzyme.

== Pathology ==

Arginase deficiency typically refers to decreased function of arginase I, the liver isoform of arginase. This deficiency is commonly referred to as hyperargininemia or arginemia. The disorder is hereditary and autosomal recessive. It is characterized by lowered activity of arginase in hepatic cells. It is considered to be the rarest of the heritable defects in ureagenesis. Arginase deficiency, unlike other urea cycle disorders, does not entirely prevent ureagenesis. A proposed reason for the continuation of arginase function is suggested by increased activity of arginase II in the kidneys of subjects with arginase I deficiency. Researchers believe that buildup of arginine triggers increased expression of arginase II. The enzymes in the kidney will then catalyze ureagenesis, compensating somewhat for a decrease in arginase I activity in the liver. Due to this alternate method of removing excess arginine and ammonia from the bloodstream, subjects with arginase deficiency tend to have longer lifespans than those who have other urea cycle defects.

Symptoms of the disorder include neurological impairment, dementia, retardation of growth, and hyperammonemia. While some symptoms of the disease can be controlled via dietary restrictions and pharmaceutical developments, no cure or completely effective therapy currently exists.

<doc id="602623" wikidata="Q332487" url="?curid=602623" title="Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield">
<text>Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield (22 September 169424 March 1773) was a British statesman, diplomat, man of letters, and an acclaimed wit of his time.

==Early life==
He was born in London to Philip Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Chesterfield, and Lady Elizabeth Savile, and known by the courtesy title of Lord Stanhope until the death of his father in 1726. Following the death of his mother in 1708, Stanhope was raised mainly by his grandmother, the Marchioness of Halifax. Educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he left just over a year into his studies, after focusing on languages and oration. He subsequently embarked on the Grand Tour, to complete his education as a nobleman, by exposure to the cultural legacies of Classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to become acquainted with his aristocratic counterparts and the polite society of Continental Europe.

In the course of his tour, the death of Queen Anne and accession of King George I in 1714 opened a political career for Stanhope, and he quickly returned to England. A supporter of the Whig party, he entered government service as a courtier to the King, through the mentorship of his relative, James Stanhope (later 1st Earl Stanhope), the King&#x27;s favourite minister, who procured his appointment as Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales.

==Political career==
In 1715, Stanhope entered the House of Commons as Lord Stanhope of Shelford and as member for St Germans. Later, when the impeachment of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde came before the House, he used the occasion (5 August 1715) to try out the result of his rhetorical studies. His maiden speech was fluent and dogmatic, but upon its conclusion, another member, after first complimenting the speech, reminded the young orator that he was still six weeks short of his age of majority and consequently liable to a fine of £500 for speaking in the House. Lord Stanhope left with a low bow, and set out for the Continent.

While in Paris, he sent the government valuable information about the developing Jacobite plot. In 1716, he returned to Britain, resumed his Commons seat and became known as a skilled yet tactful debater. When George I quarrelled with the Prince of Wales the same year, Lord Stanhope remained politically faithful to the Prince but was careful not to break with the King&#x27;s party. However, his continued friendly correspondence with the Prince&#x27;s mistress, Henrietta Howard, earned Chesterfield the personal hatred of the Prince&#x27;s wife, Princess Caroline of Ansbach. In 1723, he was appointed Captain of the Gentlemen Pensioners. In January 1725, on the revival of the Order of the Bath, the red ribbon was offered to him, but Stanhope declined the honour.
Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1726, Stanhope became the 4th Earl of Chesterfield and assumed his seat in the House of Lords. His inclination towards oration, often seen as ineffective in the House of Commons because of its polish and lack of force, was met with appreciation in the House of Lords, and won many to his side. In 1727 the Prince of Wales succeeded his father, becoming King George II. In 1728, in service to the new king, Chesterfield was sent to the Hague as ambassador to The Netherlands, where his gentle tact and linguistic dexterity served him well. As a reward for his diplomatic service, Chesterfield received the Order of the Garter in 1730, the position of Lord Steward, and the friendship of Robert Walpole, the de facto head of the government. While a British envoy in the Hague, he helped negotiate the second Treaty of Vienna (1731), which signalled the collapse of the Anglo-French Alliance, and the beginning of the Anglo-Austrian Alliance. In 1732, Madelina Elizabeth du Bouchet, a French governess, gave birth to his illegitimate son, Philip for whom Chesterfield wrote the &quot;Letters to his Son&quot; giving advice on life. In 1731, while at The Hague, Chesterfield initiated the Grand Duke of Tuscany (later to become Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor) from the House of Habsburg-Lorraine into Freemasonry, which was at the time being used as an intelligence network by the British Whigs. By the end of 1732, ill health and financial troubles caused Chesterfield&#x27;s return to Britain and his resignation as ambassador. 

In 1733, Chesterfield married Melusina von der Schulenberg, the Countess of Walsingham, who was the illegitimate daughter of Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal by George I. After recuperating from his illness, Chesterfield resumed his seat in the House of Lords, where he was now one of the acknowledged leaders. He supported the ministry and leadership of Robert Walpole, but withheld the blind fealty that Walpole preferred of his followers. Lord Chesterfield strongly opposed the Excise Bill, the Whig Party leader&#x27;s measure, in the House of Lords, and his brothers also argued against it in the House of Commons. Even though Walpole eventually succumbed to the political opposition to the bill and abandoned the measure, Chesterfield was summarily dismissed from his stewardship. For the next two years, he led the opposition in the Upper House to effect Walpole&#x27;s downfall. During that time, he resided in Grosvenor Square and became involved in the creation of a new charity called the Foundling Hospital of which he was a founding governor.

In 1741, Chesterfield signed the protest calling for Walpole&#x27;s dismissal and then went abroad on account of his health; after visiting Voltaire in Brussels, he went to Paris where he associated with writers and men of letters, including Crebillon the Younger, Fontenelle and Montesquieu. In 1742, Walpole&#x27;s fall from political power was complete, but although he and his administration had been overthrown in no small part by Chesterfield&#x27;s efforts, the new ministry did not count Chesterfield either in its ranks or among its supporters. He remained in opposition and distinguished himself by the courtly bitterness of his attacks on George II, who began to hate him violently.

In 1743, Chesterfield began writing under the name of &quot;Jeffrey Broadbottom&quot; for pamphlets and a new journal, &quot;Old England; or, the Constitutional Journal&quot;, which appeared (&quot;broad bottom&quot; being a term for a government with cross-party appeal). A number of pamphlets, with which Chesterfield had the help of Edmund Waller, followed. His energetic campaign against the King and his government won the gratitude of the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough, who left him £20,000 as a mark of her appreciation. In 1744, the King was compelled to abandon Lord Carteret, the successor to Walpole, and the coalition for a &quot;Broad Bottom&quot; party, led by Chesterfield and Pitt, came into office in coalition with the Pelhams.

In the troubled state of European politics, the Earl&#x27;s calm conduct and diplomatic experience were more useful abroad than at home, and he was sent to The Hague for a second time as ambassador. The object of his mission this time was to persuade the Dutch to join in the War of the Austrian Succession and to arrange the details of their assistance. Success was quickly achieved, and on his return a few weeks afterwards, he received the Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland, which he had long coveted.
Chesterfield&#x27;s short administration (January 1745 – November 1746) in Ireland was effective, as he repressed the corruption traditional to the office, and established schools and factories. He was the first official to allow Dubliners to roam in Phoenix Park, and installed the central &quot;Phoenix Monument&quot;, a phoenix bird on a Corinthian column (the 2.8 mi main road through the park is still known as Chesterfield Avenue). He worked with, and pacified, both the Protestant Orange Order and Roman Catholic Jacobite factions; as a result, Irish Jacobites did not assist the Jacobite rising of 1745. Anecdotally, upon being roused for a false alarm of an Irish rebellion and being told that &quot;the papists in Ireland are all up!&quot;, he replied: &quot;I am not surprised at it, why, it is ten o&#x27;clock, I should have been up too, had I not overslept myself&quot;.

In 1746, however, he had to exchange the Lord-Lieutenancy for the post of Secretary of State. Chesterfield had hoped to retain a hold over the King through the influence of Lady Yarmouth, by then George II&#x27;s mistress, but John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich and Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, combined forces against him, and in 1748, he resigned the ministerial seal and returned to his books and playing cards with the admirable composure that was one of his most striking characteristics. Despite his denials, Chesterfield is speculated to have at least helped to write &quot;Apology for a late Resignation&quot;, in a &quot;Letter from an English Gentleman to his Friend at The Hague&quot;, which ran to four editions in 1748.

==Later years==
 While continuing to attend and participate in the Upper House&#x27;s proceedings, Chesterfield turned down the dukedom offered to him by George II, whose wrath had melted in the face of Chesterfield&#x27;s diplomacy and rhetoric. In 1751, seconded by George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, the president of the Royal Society, and the mathematician James Bradley, Chesterfield greatly distinguished himself in the debates on establishing a definitive calendar for Britain and the Commonwealth. With the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750, he successfully established the Gregorian calendar and a calendar year that began on 1 January for Great Britain, which had lagged behind other European countries in adopting the Gregorian calendar. Informally, the Act was also known as the &quot;Chesterfield&#x27;s Act&quot;. After this, he gradually started to withdraw from politics and society because of his growing deafness.

In 1755, he and Samuel Johnson had a dispute over &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. Eight years previously, Johnson had sent Chesterfield an outline of his &quot;Dictionary&quot;, along with a business offer for promoting the proposed work; Chesterfield agreed and invested £10. Although Chesterfield wrote two anonymous articles for &quot;World&quot; magazine shortly before the dictionary&#x27;s publication praising both Johnson&#x27;s exhaustive editorial work and the dictionary itself, Johnson was disappointed at the lack of interest in the project from Chesterfield during compilation of the dictionary. Upset with what he saw as a lack of support from an avowed man of letters and patron of literature, Johnson wrote the &quot;Letter to Chesterfield&quot;, which dealt with the dynamics of the patron–artist relationship. Chesterfield was not offended by the letter but, rather, was impressed by its language. After receiving it, he displayed it on a table for visitors to read and, according to Robert Dodsley, said &quot;This man has great powers&quot; and then he &quot;pointed out the severest passages, and observed how well they were expressed&quot;. Adams told Johnson what was said, and Johnson responded, &quot;That is not Lord Chesterfield; he is the proudest man this day&quot;. Adams responded, &quot;No, there is one person at least as proud; I think, by your own account, you are the prouder man of the two&quot;. Johnson, finishing, said, &quot;But mine, was &quot;defensive&quot; pride&quot;.

In the 1760s, Chesterfield offered a cogent critique of the Stamp Act 1765 passed through Parliament by George Grenville&#x27;s ministry. In a letter to his friend, the Duke of Newcastle, Chesterfield noted the absurdity of the Stamp Act because it could not be properly enforced, but if made effective, the Act would anyway generate a revenue no greater than £8,000 per year, but the annual cost of reduced trade from the American colonies would be about £1,000,000.

== &quot;Letters to His Son&quot; ==
Eugenia Stanhope, the impoverished widow of Chesterfield&#x27;s illegitimate son, Philip Stanhope, was the first to publish the book &quot;Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman&quot; (1774), which comprises a thirty-year correspondence in more than 400 letters. Begun in 1737 and continued until the death of his son in 1768, Chesterfield wrote mostly instructive communications about geography, history, and classical literature, with later letters focusing on politics and diplomacy. The letters were written in French, English and Latin to refine his son&#x27;s grasp of the languages.

As a handbook for worldly success in the 18th century, the &quot;Letters to His Son&quot; give perceptive and nuanced advice for how a gentleman should interpret the social codes of etiquette and good manners:

... However frivolous a company may be, still, while you are among them, do not show them, by your inattention, that you think them so; but rather take their tone, and conform in some degree to their weakness, instead of manifesting your contempt for them. There is nothing that people bear more impatiently, or forgive less, than contempt; and an injury is much sooner forgotten than an insult. If, therefore, you would rather please than offend, rather be well than ill spoken of, rather be loved than hated; remember to have that constant attention about you which flatters every man&#x27;s little vanity; and the want of which, by mortifying his pride, never fails to excite his resentment, or at least his ill will...

Samuel Johnson said of the letters that &quot;they teach the morals of a whore, and the manners of a dancing-master&quot; as a means for getting on in the world, implying that Chesterfield promoted good manners as a method of advancement rather than because of their inherent moral value.

Despite having been an accomplished essayist and epigrammatist in his time, Lord Chesterfield&#x27;s literary reputation today derives almost entirely from &quot;Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman&quot; (1774) and &quot;Letters to His Godson&quot; (1890), books of private correspondence and paternal and avuncular advice that he never intended for publication.

==Need for legitimate heir==

In 1768 Chesterfield&#x27;s illegitimate son, Philip Stanhope, died in France of dropsy, leaving his widow Eugenia Stanhope and their two illegitimate sons, Charles and Philip. Despite his short life, the privileged education provided by his father had enabled for Philip a career in the diplomatic service, despite being handicapped as a nobleman&#x27;s illegitimate son. The grieving Chesterfield was disappointed to learn of Philip&#x27;s long and mostly secret relationship (they married the year before his death) with Eugenia, a woman of a humble social class, since that was a topic that he had covered at length in the &quot;Letters to his Son&quot;. However, Lord Chesterfield bequeathed an annuity of £100 to each of his grandsons, Charles Stanhope (1761–1845) and Philip Stanhope (1763–1801), and a further £10,000 for them both, but left no pension for Eugenia. It was that lack of funds that led her to sell the &quot;Letters to his Son&quot; to a publisher.

Left without a legitimate heir to his lands and property (he and his wife had no children together) Lord Chesterfield acted to protect his hereditary interests by adopting his distant cousin and godson, Philip Stanhope (1755–1815), a descendant of the 1st Earl of Chesterfield, as his heir and successor to the title of Earl of Chesterfield.

== Death ==
Chesterfield died on 24 March 1773, at Chesterfield House, Westminster, his London townhouse. His godson and adopted heir then became Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield.

==Legacy==
=== In literature ===
Decades after his death, Lord Chesterfield appears as a character in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s novel &quot;The Virginians&quot; (1857). He is also mentioned in Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot; (1841), wherein the foppish Sir John Chester says that Lord Chesterfield is the finest English writer:

:Shakespeare was undoubtedly very fine in his way; Milton good, though prosy; Lord Bacon deep, and decidedly knowing; but the writer who should be his country&#x27;s pride, is my Lord Chesterfield.

=== Places ===
In the UK, Chesterfield gave his name to Chesterfield Street, Mayfair, London, which runs from Curzon Street, site of the former Chesterfield House; in the US, his name has been given to Chesterfield County, Virginia, Chesterfield County, South Carolina and Chesterfield, New Hampshire. There is also a Chesterfield Road in the West Oakland neighbourhood of Pittsburgh filled with rowhouses, formerly known for its punk subculture.

=== Furniture ===
The first leather Chesterfield sofa, with its distinctive deep-buttoned, quilted leather upholstery and lower seat base, is believed to have been commissioned by Lord Chesterfield. Consequently, in the UK, the word &quot;chesterfield&quot; now describes such a sofa, with arms and back of the same height. In Canada, &quot;chesterfield&quot; used to be the predominant term for any type of couch, but has been decreasing in popularity among the younger generations.

=== Other ===

Vincent La Chapelle, a French master cook, wrote &quot;The Modern Cook&quot; while in the employ of Lord Chesterfield, and lived abroad with him in The Hague. After leaving Chesterfield&#x27;s service, La Chapelle went on to cook for – among others – William IV, Prince of Orange, John V of Portugal, and Madame de Pompadour (mistress of Louis XV of France).

Chesterfield coats, popularized by the 6th Earl, are woollen overcoats with velvet on the collar for both men and women.

D. G. Yuengling &amp; Son of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, produces a beer named Lord Chesterfield Ale after the 4th Earl of Chesterfield.

<text>Archway is a London Underground station at the intersection of Holloway Road, Highgate Hill, Junction Road and Archway Road in Archway, north London, directly underneath the Vantage Point building. It is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, between Highgate and Tufnell Park stations, in Zones 2 and 3.

==Location==

When constructed, the area was simply the northern end of Holloway Road and had no specific name but, in the hope of attracting patronage, the terminus was originally named &quot;Highgate&quot; after the village up the hill. At the time of the station&#x27;s construction the first cable tramway in Europe operated non-stop up Highgate Hill to the village from outside the Archway Tavern, and this name was also considered for the station. The main station entrance now lies beneath Archway Tower (now renamed Vantage Point) on Junction Road while the side entrance is on Highgate Hill.

==History==

The Leslie Green designed station opened on 22 June 1907, under the name &quot;Highgate&quot; faced in Green&#x27;s standard ox-blood glazed brick. It was opened as one of the northern terminals of what was then the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR).

The station was renamed &quot;Archway (Highgate)&quot; on 11 June 1939 (after the nearby road bridge over the deep cutting containing Archway Road). On 3 July 1939, the line was extended to the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s station at Highgate and East Finchley station as part of the New Works Programme. The station was renamed &quot;Highgate (Archway)&quot; on 19 January 1941, before becoming just &quot;Archway&quot; in December 1947 with the Highgate name being reassigned to the new station constructed beneath the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) high-level station of the same name.

On 2 June 2006, a train derailed while entering the reversing siding at the station.

In 2007 plans to add step-free access to the station were consulted on and a Transport and Works Act Order was granted. These plans were subsequently shelved by incoming mayor Boris Johnson.

==Design==
In 1930 the station was upgraded with escalators to replace the original lifts and the secondary entrance was replaced with a modern design by Charles Holden, virtually identical to the one he built at the same time at Hammersmith. Holden&#x27;s station was replaced in the 1970s.

The platform walls once featured the distinctive and elegantly simple tiling schemes used by Holden on the underground stations constructed at this time. Cream tiles were used throughout with the station name band formed of letter shaped tiles inset into a background of cream tiles incised to accept the lettering. Similar tiling schemes can be seen at the neighbouring Highgate station, as well as at Bethnal Green and the stations on the tunnelled section of the Hainault branch of the Central line (for example Gants Hill). All were built in the late 1930s/early 1940s. The tiles at Archway were replaced several years ago during retiling works.

, the station has escalators descending to the platforms. Alternatively, passengers can use the 113 steps to get down to the platforms.

An unusual feature for a Northern line station is that both platforms are long enough to accommodate nine car trains instead of the usual seven. This was an early attempt to solve overcrowding on the line. For many years after Archway opened the last two cars of each train were reserved exclusively for passengers travelling between Archway and Tottenham Court Road. At all other stations the last two cars remained in the running tunnel at each stop so that passengers using them had an uninterrupted journey. At Tottenham Court Road, the train stopped beyond the station such that the first two cars entered the running tunnel beyond the station allowing the passengers in the rear seven cars to embark or disembark. A consequence of this arrangement was: that the front two cars could not be used by passengers intending to disembark at Tottenham Court Road from either direction. The rear two cars ran empty south of Tottenham Court Road (Archway being the northern terminus at the time).

Following the success of this nine car arrangement, nine car operation was implemented between Kennington and Edgware, but with only a limited number of stations being accessible from the rear two cars. These were Kennington to Leicester Square inclusive and Golders Green to Colindale inclusive. Nine car trains did not stop at Mornington Crescent but this was because, at this time, all Edgeware trains did not stop there. Stations south of Tottenham Court Road operated with two cars in running tunnel. However, north of Hampstead, the stations were converted for nine car platforms as the stations are not in tunnel. The service was eventually extended to Edgware, but site constraints meant that only seven and a half cars could be accommodated on platform 1 only so either Edgware was a non nine car station or passengers were allowed to disembark via the communicating doors.

All nine car operation was suspended on 6th September 1939 when the line was split into wo sections for the installation of flood gates just after World War II was declared. It was never reinstated.

==Crossover and siding==

When the original section of the Northern Line from Charing Cross to Golders Green and Archway (then Highgate) was opened in 1907, the terminus at Archway was provided with a scissors crossover just south of the station and the running lines beyond the north end of the platforms continued as separate dead-end sidings. When the line was extended to Highgate and East Finchley in 1939, the &#x27;northbound&#x27; siding was extended as the northbound road while the &#x27;southbound&#x27; siding was retained as a dead-end siding, extended at the north end with the new southbound line from Highgate joining it just before the southbound platform and a new connection from the northbound line to the siding, thus turning the old &#x27;southbound&#x27; siding into a central reversing siding. The crossover south of the station was subsequently converted to a single trailing crossover but was decommissioned on 15 October 1967, when Archway was converted to programme-machine control from Cobourg Street. The signal box closed on 25 June 1961 when Archway became remote-controlled.

The enlarged crossover tunnel remains although cable runs extend down its centre between the two tracks for most of its length. The layout of the platforms and the underground passenger areas still reflect the station&#x27;s former role as a terminus.

==Services==
Northern line trains generally operate between Morden or Battersea Power Station to High Barnet or Mill Hill East via the Charing Cross or the Bank branch. Occasionally and during disruptions or engineering works, trains can terminate at Archway. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3–7 minutes between 05:58 and 00:19 in both directions.

==Connections==
*London Buses routes 4, 17, 41, 43, 134, 143, 210, 234, 263, 390, C11, W5 and night routes N20, N41 and N271 serve the station.
*London Underground maps and maps in London Overground trains show the station as 450m from Upper Holloway station on the Gospel Oak to Barking line. Interchange within twenty minutes is allowed between the two stations.

<doc id="602626" wikidata="Q2973133" url="?curid=602626" title="Cinema of Quebec">
<text>The history of [[film|cinema]] in [[Quebec]] started on June 27, 1896 when the Frenchman Louis Minier inaugurated the first movie projection in North America in a Montreal theatre room. However, it would have to wait until the 1960s before a genuine Quebec cinema industry would emerge. Approximately 620 feature-length films have been produced, or partially produced by the Quebec film industry since 1943.

Due to language and cultural differences between the predominantly francophone population of Quebec and the predominantly anglophone population of the rest of Canada, Quebec&#x27;s film industry is commonly regarded as a distinct entity from its English Canadian counterpart. In addition to participating in Canada&#x27;s national Genie Awards, the Quebec film industry also maintains its own awards ceremony, the Prix Iris (formerly known as Jutra). In addition, the popularity of homegrown French language films among Quebec audiences, as opposed to English Canadians&#x27; preference for Hollywood films, means that Quebec films are often more successful at the box office than English Canadian films — in fact, the top-grossing Canadian film of the year is often a French language film from Quebec.

==Before the &quot;Office national du film&quot;==

From 1896 to the 1960s, the Catholic clergy tried to control what movies Quebecers could see. Two methods were employed: censorship and prohibition of attendance by children under 16. In 1913, the &quot;Bureau de censure de vues animées&quot; (Office of censorship for motion pictures) began regulating the projection of movies in Quebec. In 1927, the Laurier-Palace Theatre burned down, killing 78 children. The church then almost succeeded at closing down all projection rooms in the province. However, the Parliament of Quebec passed a law preventing only children under 16 from attending movie projections. This law would be repealed only in 1961.

Nevertheless, some films were produced in Quebec during this period. Those were mostly documentaries, some of which were made by priests (Albert Tessier) and civil servants (Herménégilde Lavoie). Joseph-Arthur Homier is considered the first director of feature-length films in Quebec, and his 1922 production, &quot;Madeleine de Verchères&quot;, was based on the life of the 17th-century Quebec heroine, Madeleine de Verchères. In the 1940s and 1950s, the first commercial attempts at cinema happened. Two production houses were at the origins of all the movies of this period: Renaissance Films and Québec Productions. Most of the commercial feature films came primarily from four directors: Fyodor Otsep, Paul Gury, Jean-Yves Bigras, and René Delacroix. Notable films of this period include &quot;The Music Master&quot; (&quot;Le Père Chopin&quot;, 1945), &quot;A Man and His Sin&quot; (&quot;Un homme et son péché&quot;, 1949), &quot;The Nightingale and the Bells&quot; (&quot;Le Rossignol et les cloches&quot;, 1952), &quot;Little Aurore&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (&quot;La petite Aurore l&#x27;enfant martyre&quot;, 1952), &quot;Tit-Coq&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Promised Land&quot; (&quot;Les brûlés&quot;, 1959).

==After the &quot;Office national du film&quot;==

The National Film Board of Canada was established by the Parliament of Canada in 1939. Its office moved from Ottawa to Montreal in 1956. In 1957, the new commissioner, Albert Trueman, recommended the creation of a separately funded French production wing. Minister J. W. Pickersgill rejected Trueman&#x27;s recommendation as Ottawa feared that two separate organizations would develop under the same roof. This decision intensified the campaign of the Quebec French language press for an autonomous French language branch. Guy Roberge was appointed as the NFB&#x27;s first francophone Commissioner in April 1957. The French branch of the National Film Board of Canada was established and the NFB became autonomous in 1959.

Direct Cinema filmmakers Michel Brault, Pierre Perrault and Gilles Groulx all made their debut at the NFB. That decade also saw the beginnings of directors Claude Jutra, Gilles Carle and Denys Arcand.

==The 1960s and 1970s==
Two key changes in the late 1960s paved the way for a new era in Québécois cinema. First, in 1967, Quebec&#x27;s (religious) censorship bureau was replaced by a film ratings system administered by the province. The other phenomenon was the introduction, in 1967, by the federal government, of its Canadian Film Development Corporation (CFDC, to become Telefilm Canada). This allowed a greater number of films to reach the screen through government subsidy.

Commercial directors such as Denis Héroux became known for his films &quot;Valérie&quot; and &quot;&quot;, two comedies with erotic overtones showing popular success not seen in Quebec since Jean-Yves Bigras&#x27; &quot;La Petite Aurore l&#x27;enfant martyre&quot; (1952).

The seventies also marked a high in national filmmaking seen from an artistic perspective, an assessment supported by opinion polls such as the TIFF List of Canada&#x27;s Top 10 Films of All Time, which has included several films from that decade every year that the poll was taken. Arcand and Carle had critical (especially at Cannes) and some commercial success with films such as &quot;Gina&quot; (Arcand) and &quot;La vraie nature de Bernadette&quot; (Carle). In 1971, director Claude Jutra released one of the most critically praised Quebec film to date, &quot;Mon oncle Antoine&quot;. However, his next movie, an adaptation of Anne Hébert&#x27;s &quot;Kamouraska&quot;, was a commercial and critical failure. It should be mentioned that this film suffered re-editing done to accommodate theater owners. A two-hour-long restored version, seen in 2003, shows more artistic coherence. In 1977, Jean Beaudin&#x27;s &quot;J.A. Martin Photographe&quot; was selected at Cannes where Monique Mercure, the female star of the film, won Best Actress (tying with Shelley Duvall for &quot;3 Women&quot;).

In 1971, a group of filmmakers in Montreal established the Association coopérative de productions audio-visuelles (ACPAV), which would play an important role in Quebec cinema over the next decades by funding and releasing the earliest films by many emerging Quebec directors.

==The 1980s==

The victory of the &quot;no&quot; camp in the referendum on sovereignty association was a turning point in Québécois history and culture. Denys Arcand made one of his most acclaimed picture with the NFB, &quot;Le confort et l&#x27;indifférence&quot;, about the result of the referendum. He then proceeded to direct two movies that were nominated for best foreign picture at the Academy Awards: 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the American Empire (Le Déclin de l&#x27;empire américain)&quot; and 1989&#x27;s &quot;Jesus of Montreal (Jésus de Montréal)&quot;.

After 1980, a lot of artists felt that the struggle to build a nation that had animated early Quebec cinema was lost. Québécois filmmakers began to make movies that were no longer centred on the Québécois identity. The 1986 success, at home and abroad, of &quot;Le déclin...&quot; marked another turning point in the movie history of the province. The government-funded movie industry tried to repeat Arcand&#x27;s success with international co-productions, big budget movies and so-called &quot;mass audience movies&quot;.

Meanwhile, director Robert Morin made himself known with personal movies like &quot;Requiem for a Handsome Bastard (Requiem pour un beau sans-coeur)&quot;. Claude Jutra committed suicide in the 1980s after a struggle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and Gilles Carle became too sick to direct.

==The 1990s and 2000s==

1990-2002 saw the solidification of Quebec&#x27;s movie industry. Independent films such as Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Maelström&quot;, Denis Chouinard&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ange de goudron&quot;, and &quot;Un crabe dans la tête&quot; caught the media&#x27;s attention. In 1994, Pierre Falardeau&#x27;s &quot;Octobre&quot; told a fictionalized version of the October Crisis from the point of view of the Chenier Cell, the FLQ terrorist cell who in 1970 kidnapped and executed Quebec minister and Deputy Premier Pierre Laporte.

Home-made blockbusters came in 2000s and begin to dominate their home market, putting American blockbusters in second place. &quot;Séraphin: un homme et son péché&quot;, directed by Charles Binamé, was a major success at the box office in 2002. The next year, 2003, was called &quot;the year of Quebec cinema&#x27;s rebirth&quot; with Denys Arcand winning the foreign film Oscar for &quot;The Barbarian Invasions (Les Invasions barbares)&quot;, the sequel of &quot;The Decline of the American Empire (Le Déclin de l&#x27;empire américain)&quot;, and with &quot;Gaz Bar Blues&quot; and &quot;Seducing Doctor Lewis&quot; gaining both critical and public acclaim. In 2005, &quot;C.R.A.Z.Y.&quot; was released, grossing a considerable amount in such a small market, and garnering widespread praise from critics. In 2006, the Quebec-made action-comedy &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot;, a film with dialogue in both French and English, took over the title of most popular Canadian film at the Canadian box office. Sales for &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot; have totalled $13 million across the country. The previous Quebec film to hold this honour was &quot;Les Boys&quot;. In 2007, Arcand&#x27;s &quot;Days of Darkness (L&#x27;Âge des ténèbres)&quot; was selected as the closing film for the Cannes Film Festival.

In 2009, &quot;De père en flic&quot; (English: &quot;Father and Guns&quot;) matched the movie &quot;Bon Cop Bad Cop&quot; to become the highest-grossing French language film in Canadian history.

==The 2010s==
The 2010s were marked by three consecutive Academy Award nominations for Quebecois films in the Foreign Language category, namely for &quot;Incendies&quot; (2010), &quot;Monsieur Lazhar&quot; (2011) and &quot;War Witch&quot; (2012). &quot;War Witch&quot; director Kim Nguyen proclaimed &quot;People around the world are looking at Quebec cinema now and waiting for the next director to come out of here. This has a tremendous impact on a country&#x27;s recognition outside of its borders&quot;. University of Berlin film scholar Claudia Kotte wrote &quot;Incendies&quot;, &quot;Monsieur Lazhar&quot;, &quot;Inch&#x27;Allah&quot; (2012) and &quot;War Witch&quot;, represent a break from focus on local history to more global concerns.

In May 2016, Xavier Dolan became the first Quebec filmmaker to win the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, for &quot;It&#x27;s Only the End of the World.&quot; It also later won Best Film at the inaugural Prix Iris, which replaced the Jutra Awards for Quebec films, with new categories for Casting, Visual Effects, Revelation of the Year and Documentary Editing and Cinematography, and a Public Prix, chosen by viewers&#x27; votes.

<doc id="602632" wikidata="Q2365517" url="?curid=602632" title="List of rivers of India">
<text>With a land area of consisting of diverse ecosystems, India has many rivers systems and perennial streams. The rivers of India can be classified into four groups – Himalayan, Deccan, Coastal, and Inland drainage. The Himalayan rivers, mainly fed by glaciers and snow melt, arise from the Himalayas. The Deccan rivers system consists of rivers in Peninsular India, that drain into the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. There are numerous short coastal rivers, predominantly on the West coast. There are few inland rivers, which do not drain into sea.

Most of the rivers in India originate from the four major watersheds in India. The Himalayan watershed is the source of majority of the major river systems in India including the three longest rivers–the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Indus. These three river systems are fed by more than 5000 glaciers. The Aravalli range in the north-west serves the origin of few of the rivers such as the Chambal, the Banas and the Luni rivers.

The Narmada and Tapti rivers originate from the Vindhya and Satpura ranges in Central India. In the peninsular India, majority of the rivers originate from the Western Ghats and flow towards the Bay of Bengal, while only a few rivers flow from east to west from the Eastern Ghats to the Arabian sea. This is because of the difference in elevation of the Deccan plateau, which slopes gently from the west to the east. The largest of the peninsular rivers include the Godavari, the Krishna, the Mahanadi and the Kaveri.

== River systems ==
As per the classification of Food and Agriculture Organization, the rivers systems are combined into 20 river units, which includes 14 major rivers systems and 99 smaller river basins grouped into six river units. The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin is the largest, which covers 34% of the land area and contributes to nearly 59% of the available water resources.

<text>William F. Shortz (born August 26, 1952) is an American puzzle creator and editor who is the crossword editor for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He graduated from Indiana University with a degree in the invented field of enigmatology. After starting his career at Penny Press and &quot;Games&quot; magazine, he was hired by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1993. Shortz&#x27;s American Crossword Puzzle Tournament is the country&#x27;s oldest and largest crossword tournament.

==Early life and education==
Shortz was born on August 26, 1952, and raised on an Arabian horse farm in Crawfordsville, Indiana. He was drawn to puzzles at an early age; in eighth grade he wrote a paper titled &quot;Puzzles as a Profession&quot;. (The paper earned him a B+.) At age 13, Shortz wrote to &quot;Language on Vacation&quot; author Dmitri Borgmann for advice on how to pursue a career in puzzles. At age 16, Shortz began regularly contributing crossword puzzles to Dell Publishing. He eventually graduated from Indiana University in 1974, and is the only person known to hold a college degree in enigmatology, the study of puzzles. Shortz wrote his thesis about the history of American word puzzles. Shortz achieved this by designing his own curriculum through Indiana University&#x27;s Individualized Major Program. He also earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law (1977), but did not sit for the bar exam and began a career in puzzles instead. Shortz is the author or editor of more than 100 books and owns over 20,000 puzzle books and magazines dating back to 1545, reportedly the world&#x27;s largest private library on the subject. He is a member and historian of the National Puzzlers&#x27; League.

==Career==
Shortz began his career at Penny Press Magazines, then moved to &quot;Games&quot; magazine for 15 years, and was its editor from 1989 to 1990, when the magazine temporarily folded. He was rehired in late 1991, then let go in August 1993. A few months later he became the crossword puzzle editor for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the fourth in the paper&#x27;s history, following Eugene Thomas Maleska.

Shortz has been the puzzle master on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Sunday&quot; since the program was started in 1987. He is the founder of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (1978), and has been its director since that time. He founded the World Puzzle Championship in 1992 and is a director of the U.S. Puzzle Team. Shortz is also a weekly guest on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition Sunday&quot; where he hosts the Sunday Puzzle, a cooperative game between the show&#x27;s host and one of the show&#x27;s listeners. The lucky player is picked randomly from a group of submissions containing the correct answer to a qualifier puzzle issued the week before.

In February 2009, Shortz helped introduce the KenKen puzzle into &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2013, Shortz lent his name and talents in puzzle writing and editing to a new bimonthly publication entitled &quot;Will Shortz&#x27; WordPlay&quot;, published by Penny Press. He has said that his favorite crossword of all time is the Election Day crossword of November 5, 1996, designed by Jeremiah Farrell. It had two correct solutions with the same set of clues, one saying that the &quot;Lead story in tomorrow&#x27;s newspaper (!)&quot; would be &quot;BOB DOLE ELECTED&quot;, and the other correct solution saying &quot;CLINTON ELECTED&quot;. His favorite individual clue is &quot;It might turn into a different story&quot; (whose solution is ).

In addition to work as a crossword editor, Shortz is a skilled table tennis player. He has co-owned the Westchester Table Tennis Center in Pleasantville, New York since 2009, and has been playing table tennis daily for the past 11 years. This dedication to the sport reflects his dedication to puzzles, with mementos and awards from his childhood displayed in the center.

=== Controversies ===
In 2017, Shortz published a &quot;Times&quot; crossword by a prisoner named Lonnie Burton who was convicted of raping a 15-year-old boy, in addition to having burglary and robbery charges, prompting backlash from some solvers. Shortz did not include the reason for Burton&#x27;s imprisonment in his accompanying blog post. Burton had previously had crosswords published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; public editor Liz Spayd wrote in an article on the decision, &quot;What I question is the decision not to tell readers what Burton did. [...] I understand Shortz’ reflex to hold back such dark information given the levity of a puzzle, but not doing so may have made matters worse. It left some readers with the feeling of being tricked.&quot;

At various times in his career Shortz has apologized for cluing decisions that sparked public backlash for being racist, sexist or offensive.

In 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot; issued an apology after Shortz chose to publish the racial slur &quot;BEANER&quot; in the crossword, cluing it as &quot;Pitch to the head, informally&quot;. Shortz admitted that he saw the derogatory definition when he researched the word, but claimed he had never personally heard it, and explained that as long as a word also has a &quot;benign&quot; meaning, it meets his editorial standards for publication. Shortz defended his use of &quot;BEANER&quot; and noted he has published and stands by the benign meanings of the terms &quot;CHINK&quot; and &quot;GO OK&quot; (or &quot;GOOK&quot;), both slurs for people of Asian descent.

In 2020, more than 600 crossword constructors and solvers signed an open letter to the executive director of &quot;Times&quot; puzzles asking for changes and expressing concerns regarding the diversity within the puzzle department at the &quot;Times&quot; and the puzzle itself. The letter also described the resignation of Claire Muscat, a woman who was hired as a test-solver, who resigned because of what she described as being hired to provide a perfunctory token female perspective.

As an introduction to his speech, Shortz quizzed the audience on well-known IU graduates and their unconventional majors.

In May 2011, with Barbadian champion (and his long-time friend) Robert Roberts, he opened one of the largest table tennis clubs in the Northeast in Pleasantville. In 2012, Shortz set a goal for himself to play table tennis every day for a year, but surpassed his goal, playing for 1000 consecutive days, and then eventually reaching a streak of 10 years in 2022.

In his free time, Shortz also enjoys biking, reading, traveling, and collecting antique puzzle books.

<text>Northeast India, officially the North Eastern Region (NER), is the easternmost region of India representing both a geographic and political administrative division of the country. It comprises eight states—Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura (commonly known as the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;), and the &quot;brother&quot; state of Sikkim.

The region shares an international border of (about 99 per cent of its total geographical boundary) with several neighbouring countries – with China in the north, with Myanmar in the east, with Bangladesh in the south-west, with Nepal in the west, and with Bhutan in the north-west. It comprises an area of , almost 8 per cent of that of India. The Siliguri Corridor connects the region to the rest of mainland India.

The states of North Eastern Region are officially recognised under the North Eastern Council (NEC), constituted in 1971 as the acting agency for the development of the north eastern states. Long after induction of NEC, Sikkim formed part of the North Eastern Region as the eighth state in 2002. India&#x27;s Look-East connectivity projects connect Northeast India to East Asia and ASEAN. The city of Guwahati in Assam is referred to as the &quot;Gateway to the Northeast&quot; and is the largest metropolis in Northeast India.

==History==


The earliest settlers may have been Austroasiatic speakers from Southeast Asia, followed by Tibeto-Burman speakers from China, and by 500 BCE Indo-Aryan speakers from the Gangetic Plains as well as Kra–Dai speakers from southern Yunnan and Shan State. Due to the biodiversity and crop diversity of the region, archaeological researchers believe that early settlers of Northeast India had domesticated several important plants. Historians believe that the 100 BCE writings of Chinese explorer Zhang Qian indicate an early trade route via Northeast India. The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; mentions a people called Sêsatai in the region, who produced malabathron (cinnamon-like aromatic leaves, dried and used as a flavouring agent), so prized in the old world. Ptolemy&#x27;s Geographia (2nd century CE) calls the region &quot;Kirrhadia&quot;, apparently after the Kirata population.

In the early historical period (most of the first millennium CE), Kamarupa straddled most of present-day Northeast India. Xuanzang, a travelling Chinese Buddhist monk, visited Kamarupa in the 7th century CE. He described the people as &quot;short in stature and black-looking&quot;, whose speech differed a little from mid-India and who were of simple but violent disposition. He wrote that the people in Kamarupa knew of Sichuan, which lay to the kingdom&#x27;s east beyond a treacherous mountain.

The northeastern states were established during the British Raj of the 19th and early 20th centuries, when they became relatively isolated from traditional trading partners such as Bhutan and Myanmar. Many of the peoples in present-day Mizoram, Meghalaya and Nagaland converted to Christianity under the influence of British (Welsh) missionaries.

===Formation of North Eastern states===

Since the Moamoria disturbances, the Ahom dynasty was on the decline. The British appeared on the scene in the guise of saviours. In the early 19th century, both the Ahom and the Manipur kingdoms fell to a Burmese invasion. The ensuing First Anglo-Burmese War resulted in the entire region coming under British control. In the colonial period (1826–1947), North East India was made a part of Bengal Province from 1839 to 1873, after which Colonial Assam became its own province, but which included Sylhet.

After Indian Independence from British Rule in 1947, the Northeastern region of British India consisted of Assam and the princely states of Tripura Kingdom and Manipur Kingdom. Subsequently, Manipur and Tripura were made Union Territories of India in 1956 and in 1972 attained fully-fledged statehood. Later, Nagaland attained statehood in 1963, Meghalaya in 1972. Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram became full-fledged states on 20 February 1987, being carved out of the large territory of Assam. Sikkim was integrated as the eighth North Eastern Council state in 2002.

The city of Shillong served as the capital of the Assam province created during British Rule. It remained the capital of undivided Assam until the formation of the state of Meghalaya in 1972. The capital of Assam was shifted to Dispur, a part of Guwahati, and Shillong was designated as the capital of Meghalaya.

===World War II===

Initially, the Japanese had invaded British territories in Southeast Asia, including Burma (now Myanmar), with the intention of creating a fortified perimeter around Japan. The British had neglected the defence of Burma, and by early 1942, the Japanese had captured Rangoon and pushed Allied forces back towards India through a gruelling retreat.

In response to the Japanese advance, the British formed the South East Asia Command (SEAC) under Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten in November 1943. This command brought new energy to the war effort in the region and emphasised the importance of standing firm and fighting on despite logistical challenges, such as during the monsoon season.

The Japanese launched an offensive in March 1944 aimed at capturing Imphal and Kohima, key locations in northeast India. Capturing these areas would have allowed the Japanese to disrupt Allied supply lines to China and launch air attacks against India.

However, the Allied forces, under the leadership of Field Marshal William Slim, held firm. They adopted aggressive tactics, including the creation of defensive &quot;boxes&quot; and the use of jungle warfare techniques. Despite being surrounded, the defenders at Kohima held out against intense Japanese attacks until reinforcements arrived.

The battles of Imphal and Kohima resulted in a decisive defeat for the Japanese. They suffered heavy casualties and were forced to retreat, marking a turning point in the Burma Campaign. The Allied victory paved the way for subsequent offensives to clear Japanese forces from Burma and ultimately led to the re-conquest of the region.

===Sino-Indian War (1962)===
Arunachal Pradesh, a state in the Northeastern tip of India, is claimed by China as South Tibet. Sino-Indian relations degraded, resulting in the Sino-Indian War of 1962. The cause of the escalation into war is still disputed by both Chinese and Indian sources. During the war in 1962, the PRC (China) captured much of the NEFA (North-East Frontier Agency) created by India in 1954. But on 21 November 1962, China declared a unilateral ceasefire, and withdrew its troops behind the McMahon Line. China returned Indian prisoners of war in 1963.

===Seven Sister States===

The &quot;Seven Sister States&quot; is a popular term for the contiguous states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura prior to inclusion of the state of Sikkim into the North Eastern Region of India. The sobriquet &#x27;Land of the Seven Sisters&#x27; was coined to coincide with the inauguration of the new states in January 1972 by Jyoti Prasad Saikia, a journalist in Tripura, in the course of a radio talk show. He later compiled a book on the interdependence and commonness of the Seven Sister States. It has been primarily because of this publication that the nickname has caught on.

==Geography==

The Northeast region can be physiographically categorised into the Eastern Himalaya, the Patkai and the Brahmaputra and the Barak valley plains. Northeast India (at the confluence of Indo-Malayan, Indo-Chinese, and Indian biogeographical realms) has a predominantly humid sub-tropical climate with hot, humid summers, severe monsoons, and mild winters. Along with the west coast of India, this region has some of the Indian subcontinent&#x27;s last remaining rainforests, which support diverse flora and fauna and several crop species. Reserves of petroleum and natural gas in the region are estimated to constitute a fifth of India&#x27;s total potential.

The region is covered by the mighty Brahmaputra-Barak river systems and their tributaries. Geographically, apart from the Brahmaputra, Barak and Imphal valleys and some flatlands in between the hills of Meghalaya and Tripura, the remaining two-thirds of the area is hilly terrain interspersed with valleys and plains; the altitude varies from almost sea-level to over above MSL. The region&#x27;s high rainfall, averaging around and above creates problems of the ecosystem, high seismic activity, and floods. The states of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim have a montane climate with cold, snowy winters and mild summers.

===Climate===

Northeast India has a subtropical climate that is influenced by its relief and influences from the southwest and northeast monsoons. The Himalayas to the north, the Meghalaya plateau to the south and the hills of Nagaland, Mizoram and Manipur to the east influences the climate. Since monsoon winds originating from the Bay of Bengal move northeast, these mountains force the moist winds upwards, causing them to cool adiabatically and condense into clouds, releasing heavy precipitation on these slopes. It is the rainiest region in the country, with many places receiving an average annual precipitation of , which is mostly concentrated in summer during the monsoon season. Cherrapunji, located on the Meghalaya plateau is one of the rainiest place in the world with an annual precipitation of . Temperatures are moderate in the Brahmaputra and Barak valley river plains which decreases with altitude in the hilly areas. At the highest altitudes, there is permanent snow cover. In general, the region has 3 seasons: Winter, Summer, and rainy season in which the rainy season coincides with the summer months much like the rest of India. Winter is from early November until mid March while summer is from mid-April to mid-October.

Under the Köppen climate classification, the region is divided into 3 broad types: A (tropical climates), C (warm temperate mesothermal climates), and D (snow microthermal climates). The tropical climates are located in parts of Manipur, Tripura, Mizoram, and the Cachar plains south of 25N and are classified as tropical wet and dry (&quot;Aw&quot;). Much of Assam, Nagaland, northern parts of Meghalaya and Manipur and parts of Arunachal Pradesh fall within the warm temperature mesothermal climates (type C) where the mean temperatures in coldest months range from . The entire Brahmaputra valley has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa/Cwa&quot;) with hot summers. At altitudes between located in the eastern hills of Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, a (&quot;Cfb/CWb&quot;) climate prevails with warm summers. Locations above in Meghalaya, parts of Nagaland, and northern Arunachal Pradesh have a (&quot;Cfc/Cwc&quot;) climate with short and cool summers. Finally, the extreme northern parts of Arunachal Pradesh are classified as humid continental climates with mean winter temperatures below .

;Temperature
Temperatures vary by altitude with the warmest places being in the Brahmaputra and Barak River plains and the coldest at the highest altitudes. It is also influenced by proximity to the sea with the valleys and western areas being close to the sea, which moderates temperatures. Generally, temperatures in the hilly and mountainous areas are lower than the plains which lie at a lower altitude. Summer temperatures tend to be more uniform than winter temperatures due to high cloud cover and humidity.

In the Brahmaputra and Barak valley river plains, mean winter temperatures vary between while mean summer temperatures are around . The highest summer temperatures occur in the West Tripura plain with Agartala, the capital of Tripura having mean maximum summer temperatures ranging between in April. The highest temperatures in summer occur before the arrival of monsoons and thus eastern areas have the highest temperatures in June and July where the monsoon arrives later than western areas. In the Cachar Plain, located south of the Brahmaputra plain, temperatures are higher than the Brahmaputra plain although the temperature range is smaller owing to higher cloud cover and the monsoons that moderate night temperatures year round.

In the mountainous areas of Arunachal Pradesh, the Himalayan ranges in the northern border with India and China experience the lowest temperatures with heavy snow during winter and temperatures that drop below freezing. Areas with altitudes exceeding receive snowfall during winters and have cool summers. Below above sea level, winter temperatures reach up to during the day with nights dropping to zero while summers are cool, with a mean maximum of and a mean minimum of . In the hilly areas of Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram, winters are cold while summers are cool.

The plains in Manipur has colder winter minimums than what is warranted by its elevation owing to being surrounded by hills on all sides. This is due to temperature inversions during winter nights when cold air descends from the hills
into the valleys below and its geographic location which prevents winds that bring hot temperatures and humidity from coming into the Manipur plain. For example, in Imphal, winter daytime temperatures hover around but nighttime temperatures drop to .

;Rainfall
No part of Northeast India receives less than of rainfall a year. Areas in the Brahmputra valley receive of rainfall a year while mountainous areas receive a year. The southwest monsoon is responsible for bringing 90% of the annual rainfall to the region. April to late October are the months where most of the rainfall in Northeast India occurs with June and July being the rainiest months. In most parts of the region, the average date of onset of the monsoons is 1 June. Southern areas are the first to receive the monsoon (May or June) with the Brahmaputra valley and the mountainous north receiving later (later May or June). In the hilly parts of Mizoram, the closer proximity to the Bay of Bengal causes it to experience early monsoons with June being the wettest season.

===High-risk seismic zone===
The North Eastern Region of India is a mega-earthquake prone zone caused by active fault planes beneath formed by the convergence of three tectonic plates viz. India Plate, Eurasian Plate and Burma Plate. Historically the region has suffered from two great earthquakes (M &gt; 8.0) – 1897 Assam earthquake and 1950 Assam-Tibet earthquake – and about 20 large earthquakes (8.0 &gt; M &gt; 7.0) since 1897. The 1950 Assam-Tibet earthquake is still the largest earthquake in India.

WWF has identified the entire Eastern Himalayas as a priority Global 200 ecoregion. Conservation International has upscaled the Eastern Himalaya hotspot to include all the eight states of Northeast India, along with the neighbouring countries of Bhutan, southern China and Myanmar.

The region has been identified by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research as a center of rice germplasm. The National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), India, has highlighted the region as being rich in wild relatives of crop plants. It is the center of origin of citrus fruits. Two primitive variety of maize, Sikkim Primitive 1 and 2, have been reported from Sikkim (Dhawan, 1964). Although jhum cultivation, a traditional system of agriculture, is often cited as a reason for the loss of forest cover of the region, this primary agricultural economic activity practised by local tribes supported the cultivation of 35 varieties of crops. The region is rich in medicinal plants and many other rare and endangered taxa. Its high endemism in both higher plants, vertebrates, and avian diversity has qualified it as a biodiversity hotspot.

The following figures highlight the biodiversity significance of the region:
* 51 forest types are found in the region, broadly classified into six major types – tropical moist deciduous forests, tropical semi-evergreen forests, tropical wet evergreen forests, subtropical forests, temperate forests, and alpine forests.
* Out of the nine important vegetation types of India, six are found in the North Eastern Region.
* These forests harbour 8,000 out of 15,000 species of flowering plants. In floral species richness, the highest diversity is reported from the states of Arunachal Pradesh (5000 species) and Sikkim (4500 species) among the North Eastern states.
* According to the &quot;Indian Red Data Book,&quot; published by the Botanical Survey of India, 10 per cent of the flowering plants in the country are endangered. Of the 1500 endangered floral species, 800 are reported from Northeast India.
* Most of the North Eastern states have more than 60% of their area under forest cover, a minimum suggested coverage for the hill states in the country in order to protect from erosion.
* Northeast India is a part of Indo-Burma hotspot. This hotspot is the second largest in the world, next only to the Mediterranean Basin, with an area among the 25 identified.

===Fauna===


The International Council for Bird Preservation, UK identified the Assam plains and the Eastern Himalaya as an Endemic Bird Area (EBA). The EBA has an area of 220,000 km2 following the Himalayan range in the countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Nepal, Myanmar and the Indian states of Sikkim, North Bengal, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Mizoram. Because of a southward occurrence of this mountain range in comparison to other Himalayan ranges, this region has a distinctly different climate, with warmer mean temperatures and fewer days with frost, and much higher rainfall. This has resulted in the occurrence of a rich array of restricted-range bird species. More than two critically endangered species, three endangered species, and 14 vulnerable species of birds are in this EBA. Stattersfield et al. (1998) identified 22 restricted range species, out of which 19 are confined to this region and the remaining three are present in other endemic and secondary areas. Eleven of the 22 restricted-range species found in this region are considered as threatened (Birdlife International 2001), a number greater than in any other EBA of India.

Northeast India is very rich in faunal diversity. There are as many as 15 species of non-human primates and most important of them are hoolock gibbon, stumptied macaque, pigtailed macaque, golden langur, hanuman langur and rhesus monkey. The most important and endangered species is one-horned rhinoceros. The forests of the region are also the habitats of elephant, royal Bengal tiger, leopard, golden cat, fishing cat, marbled cat, Bengal fox etc. the Gangetic dolphin in the Brahmaputra is also an endangered species. The other endangered species are otter, mugger crocodile, tortoise and some fishes.

WWF has identified the following priority ecoregions in North-East India:
: Brahmaputra Valley semi-evergreen forests
: Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests
: Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests
: Northeast India–Myanmar pine forests

==Demographics==


The total population of Northeast India is 46 million with 68 per cent of that living in Assam alone. Assam also has a higher population density of 397 persons per km2 than the national average of 382 persons per km2. The literacy rates in the states of the Northeastern region, except those in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, are higher than the national average of 74 per cent. As per 2011 census, Meghalaya recorded the highest population growth of 27.8 per cent among all the states of the region, higher than the national average at 17.64 per cent; while Nagaland recorded the lowest in the entire country with a negative 0.5 per cent.
===Largest cities by population===

According to 2011 Census of India, the largest cities in Northeast India are 
===Languages===

Northeast India constitutes a single linguistic region within the Indian national context, with about 220 languages in multiple language families (Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Kra–Dai, Austroasiatic, as well as some creole languages) that share a number of features that set them apart from most other areas of the Indian subcontinent (such as alveolar consonants rather than the more typical dental/retroflex distinction). Assamese, an Indo-Aryan language spoken mostly in the Brahmaputra Valley, developed as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for many speech communities. Assamese-based pidgin/creoles have developed in Nagaland (Nagamese) and Arunachal (Nefamese), though Nefamese has been replaced by Hindi in recent times.

===Religions===

Hinduism is the majority religion in the North Eastern states of Assam, Tripura, Manipur, Sikkim and the faith of a sizable minority in Arunachal Pradesh, while Christianity is the majority religion in Meghalaya, Nagaland and Mizoram and the plurality faith of Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. A significant community of the state of Arunachal Pradesh follows the indigenous religion of Donyi-Polo. Islam has a significant presence in Assam and about 93% of all North East Muslims are concentrated in that state alone. Meanwhile, about 30% of India&#x27;s Christian population is concentrated in the North Eastern region. There is a significant presence of Buddhism in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram.

===Ethnic groups===
Northeast India has over 220 ethnic groups and an equal number of dialects in which Bodo form the largest indigenous ethnic group. The hills states in the region like Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland are predominantly inhabited by tribal people with a degree of diversity even within the tribal groups. The region&#x27;s population results from ancient and continuous flows of migrations from Tibet, Indo-Gangetic India, the Himalayas, present Bangladesh, and Myanmar.

====Majority communities====
These ethnic groups form significant majorities in the states/regions of Northeast India:

* Assamese people - (48.38%), largest ethnicity in Assam
* Tani People - (40.32%), largest ethnicity in Arunachal Pradesh 
* Bodo people - (30.47%), largest ethnicity in Bodoland region of Assam
* Bengali people - (63.48% and 80.84%), largest ethnicity in Tripura state and Barak Valley region of Assam

* Sikkimese people - native ethnicity of Sikkim

====Minority communities====
These ethnic groups form minorities in the states of Northeast India:


==Culture==
===Cuisines===

=== Arts ===
The Manipuri Raas Leela dance (from Manipur) and the Sattriya (from Assam) have been included in the elite category of the &quot;Classical Dances of India&quot;, as officially recognised by both the Sangeet Natak Akademi and the Ministry of Culture (India). Besides these, all tribes in Northeast India have their own folk dances associated with their religion and festivals. The tribal heritage in the region is rich with the practice of hunting, land cultivation and indigenous crafts. The rich culture is vibrant and visible with the traditional attires of each community.

All states in Northeast India share the handicrafts of bamboo and cane, wood carving, making traditional weapons and musical instruments, pottery and handloom weaving. Traditional tribal attires are made of thick fabrics primarily with cotton. Assam silk is a famous industry in the region.


===Music===

Northeast is a hub of different genres of music. Each community has its own rich heritage of folk music. Talented musicians and singers are plentifully found in this part of the country. The Assamese singer-composer Bhupen Hazarika achieved national and international fame with his remarkable creations. Another famous singer from Assam, Pratima Barua Pandey is a well-known folk singer. Zubeen Garg, Papon, Anurag Saikia are some other notable singers, musicians from the state of Assam. Tangkhul Naga folk blue singer like Rewben Mashangva, who comes from Ukhrul, is an acclaimed Folk singer whose music is inspired by the like of Bob Dylan and Bob Marley. Another famous folk singing band from Nagaland popularly known as Tetseo Sisters is one to be noted for their original music genre. However, younger generation has started pursuing western music more and more nowadays. The northeast region has seen a significant increase in musical innovation in the 21st century.

===Literature===

Many of the Northeast Indian indigenous communities have an ancient heritage of folktales which tell the tale of their origin, rituals, beliefs and so on. These tales are transmitted from one generation to another in oral form. They are remarkable instances of tribal wisdom and imagination. However, Assam, Tripura and Manipur have some ancient written texts. These states were mentioned in the great Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Saptakanda Ramayana in Assamese by Madhava Kandali is considered the first translation of the Sanskrit Ramayana into a modern Indo-Aryan Language. &quot;Karbi Ramayana&quot; bears witness to the old heritage of written literature in Assam. Two writers from the Northeast, viz., Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya and Mamoni Raisom Goswami, have been awarded Jnanpith, the highest literary award in India. Hence, Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya was the first Assamese writer and from the Northeast India to receive Jnanpith Award for his Assamese novel &quot;Mrityunjay&quot; (1979). Mamoni Raisom Goswami was awarded the Jnanpith Award in the year 2000. Nagen Saikia is the first writer from Assam and the Northeast India, to have been conferred the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship by the Sahitya Akademi. Some of the notable writers of Northeast Literature are--(from Assam) Lakshminath Bezbaroa, Homen Borgohain, Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya, Harekrishna Deka, Rongbong Terang, Nilmani Phukan, Indira Goswami, Hiren Bhattacharyya, Mitra Phukan, Jahnavi Barua, Dhruba Hazarika, Rita Chowdhury; (from Arunachal Pradesh) Mamang Dai; (from Manipur) Robin S Ngangom, Ratan Thiyam; (from Meghalaya) Paul Lyngdoh; (from Nagaland) Temsula Ao, Easterine Kire; (from Sikkim) Rajendra Bhandari.

===States and sub-divisions===



===Government===
The northeastern states, having 3.8% of India&#x27;s total population, are allotted 25 out of a total of 543 seats in the Lok Sabha. This is 4.6% of the total number of seats.
===20th century separatist unrest===

In 1947 Indian independence and partition resulted in the North East becoming a landlocked region. This exacerbated the isolation that has been recognised, but not studied. East Pakistan controlled access to the Indian Ocean. The mountainous terrain has hampered the construction of road and railways connections in the region.

Several militant groups have formed an alliance to fight against the governments of India, Bhutan, and Myanmar, and now use the term &quot;Western Southeast Asia&quot; (WESEA) to refer to the region. The separatist groups include the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL), People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK), People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak-Pro (PREPAK-Pro), Revolutionary People&#x27;s Front (RPF) and United National Liberation Front (UNLF) of Manipur, Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) of Meghalaya, Kamatapur Liberation Organization (KLO), which operates in Assam and North Bengal, National Democratic Front of Bodoland and ULFA of Assam, and the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT).

==Economy==

The Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MDoNER) is the deciding body under Government of India for socio-economic development in the region. The North Eastern Council under MDoNER serves as the regional governing body for Northeast India. The North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd. (NEDFi) is a public limited company providing assistance to micro, small, medium and large enterprises within the northeastern region (NER). Other organisations under MDoNER include North Eastern Regional Agricultural Marketing Corporation Limited (NERAMAC), Sikkim Mining Corporation Limited (SMC) and North Eastern Handlooms and Handicrafts Development Corporation (NEHHDC).

===Industries===
====Agriculture====

The economy is agrarian. Little land is available for settled agriculture. Along with settled agriculture, &quot;jhum&quot; (slash-and-burn) cultivation is still practised by a few indigenous groups of people.
The inaccessible terrain and internal disturbances have made rapid industrialisation difficult in the region.
====Tourism====
Living Root Bridges

Northeast India is also the home of many living root bridges. In Meghalaya, these can be found in the southern Khasi and Jaintia Hills. They are still widespread in the region, though as a practice they are fading out, with many examples having been destroyed in floods or replaced by more standard structures in recent years. Living root bridges have also been observed in the state of Nagaland, near the Indo-Myanmar border.

====Newspapers and Magazines====

Northeast India has several newspapers in both English and regional languages. The largest circulated English daily in Assam is &quot;The Assam Tribune&quot;. In Meghalaya, &quot;The Shillong Times&quot; is the highest circulated newspaper. In Nagaland, &quot;Nagaland Post&quot; has the highest number of readers. &quot;G Plus&quot; is the only print and digital English weekly tabloid published from Guwahati. In Manipur, &quot;Imphal Free Press&quot; is a highly respected newspaper. In Arunachal Pradesh, &quot;The Arunachal Times&quot; is the highest circulated newspaper in Arunachal Pradesh.

===Transportation===
====Air====


States in the North Eastern Region are well connected by air-transport conducting regular flights to all major cities in the country. The states also own several small airstrips for military and private purposes which may be accessed using Pawan Hans helicopter services. The region currently has two international airports viz. Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport, Bir Tikendrajit International Airport Maharaja Bir Bikram Airport conducting flights to Thailand, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan. While the airport in Sikkim is under-construction, Bagdogra Airport remains the closest domestic airport to the state.

====Railway====
Railway in Northeast India is delineated as Northeast Frontier Railway zone of Indian Railways. The regional network is underdeveloped. States of Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Sikkim will remain almost disconnected till March 2023 when the capital cities of Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland are expected to get the rail links once the under construction rail projects are completed.

===Look East Policy===

In the 21st century, there has been recognition among policymakers and economists of the region that the main stumbling block for economic development of the Northeastern region is the disadvantageous geographical location. It was argued that globalisation propagates deterritorialisation and a borderless world which is often associated with economic integration. With 98 per cent of its borders with China, Myanmar, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal, Northeast India appears to have a better scope for development in the era of globalisation. As a result, a new policy developed among intellectuals and politicians that one direction the Northeastern region must be looking to as a new way of development lies with political integration with the rest of India and economic integration with the rest of Asia and Oceania, with North, East and Southeast Asia, Micronesia and Polynesia in particular, as the policy of economic integration with the rest of India did not yield much dividends. With the development of this new policy, the Government of India directed its Look East policy towards developing the Northeastern region. This policy is reflected in the Year End Review 2004 of the Ministry of External Affairs, which stated that: &quot;India’s Look East Policy has now been given a new dimension by the UPA Government. India is now looking towards a partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN countries, both within BIMSTEC and the India-ASEAN Summit dialogue as integrally linked to economic and security interests, particularly for India’s East and North East region.&quot;

===Development and connectivity projects===
The north-east (NE) region of India lags behind the rest of the country in several development indicators. Although infrastructure has developed over the years, the region has to go a long way to level up the national standard. The total road network of about 377 thousand km of NE contributes about 9.94 per cent of the total roads in the country. Road density in terms of road length per thousand square kilometres. area is very poor in hilly state of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Sikkim, while it is significantly high in Tripura and Assam. The road length per 100 km2 area in NE districts varies from as less as below 10 km (in Arunachal Pradesh) to more than 200 km (in Tripura). Other means of transport such as rail, air and water is insignificant in NE (except Assam); however, a few cities of these states having direct air connectivity in the region. The total railway network in the NE is 2,602 km (as on 2011), which is only about 4 per cent of the total rail network of the country. Constructions of roads build the road map for development and road is the only means of mass transport for the entire NE of India. Due to hilly terrain and varied altitudes, rail transport is mainly confined to Assam and water transport is almost non-existent.

India&#x27;s road network has benefited greatly from the articulation of the National Highways Development Project (NHDP). The Ministry has formulated the Special Accelerated Road Development Programme for North East (SARDP-NE) for the development/improvement of more than 10,000 km roads in the NE states. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has been paying special attention to the development of national highways in the region and has assigned 10 per cent of the total allocation of fund for the NE region.

Another major constraint of surface infrastructure projects in the NE states has to be linked up with parallel developments in the neighbouring countries, particularly with Bangladesh. The restoration and extension of pre-partition land and river transit routes through Bangladesh is vital for transport infrastructure in NE states. Other international cooperation, such as, revival of Ledo road (Stilwell road) connecting Ledo in Assam to northern Myanmar and extended up to Kunming in south-eastern China, Kaladan Multimodal Transit Project and Trans-Asian Railways, could open up an eastern window for the land-locked NE states of India. Various regional initiatives, such as, the Bangladesh–China–India–Myanmar (BCIM) and Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), India–Myanmar–Thailand Trilateral Highway (IMTTH) project to link the markets of South and Southeast Asia, are in very initial stages.

<text>The term &quot;new world order&quot; refers to a new period of history evidencing dramatic change in world political thought and the balance of power in international relations. Despite varied interpretations of this term, it is commonly associated with the notion of world governance.

The phrase &quot;new world order&quot; or similar language was used in the period toward the end of the First World War in relation to Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s vision for international peace; Wilson called for a League of Nations to prevent aggression and conflict. In some instances when Franklin D. Roosevelt used the phrase &quot;new world order&quot;, or &quot;new order in the world&quot; it was to refer to Axis powers plans for world domination. Although Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman may have been hesitant to use the phrase, commentators have applied the term retroactively to the order put in place by the World War II victors including the United Nations and the Bretton Woods system as a &quot;new world order.&quot;

The most widely discussed application of the phrase of recent times came at the end of the Cold War. Presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush used the term to try to define the nature of the post-Cold War era and the spirit of great power cooperation that they hoped might materialize. Gorbachev&#x27;s initial formulation was wide-ranging and idealistic, but his ability to press for it was severely limited by the internal crisis of the Soviet system. In comparison, Bush&#x27;s vision was not less circumscribed: &quot;A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we&#x27;ve known&quot;. However, given the new unipolar status of the United States, Bush&#x27;s vision was realistic in saying that &quot;there is no substitute for American leadership&quot;. The Gulf War of 1991 was regarded as the first test of the new world order: &quot;Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order. ... The Gulf War put this new world to its first test&quot;.

== Historical usage ==

The phrase &quot;new world order&quot; was explicitly used in connection with Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s global zeitgeist during the period just after World War I during the formation of the League of Nations. &quot;The war to end all wars&quot; had been a powerful catalyst in international politics, and many felt the world could simply no longer operate as it once had. World War I had been justified not only in terms of U.S. national interest, but in moral terms—to &quot;make the world safe for democracy&quot;. After the war, Wilson argued for a new world order which transcended traditional great power politics, instead emphasizing collective security, democracy and self-determination. However, the United States Senate rejected membership of the League of Nations, which Wilson believed to be the key to a new world order. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge argued that American policy should be based on human nature &quot;as it is, not as it ought to be&quot;. Nazi activist and future German leader Adolf Hitler also used the term in 1928.
The term fell from use when it became clear the League was not living up to expectations and as a consequence was used very little during the formation of the United Nations. Former United Nations Secretary General Kurt Waldheim felt that this new world order was a projection of the American dream into Europe and that in its naïveté the idea of a new order had been used to further the parochial interests of Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau, thus ensuring the League&#x27;s eventual failure. Although some have claimed the phrase was not used at all, Virginia Gildersleeve, the sole female delegate to the San Francisco Conference in April 1945, did use it in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

The phrase was used by some in retrospect when assessing the creation of the post-World War II set of international institutions, including the United Nations; the U.S. security alliances such as NATO; the Bretton Woods system of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and even the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan were seen as characterizing or comprising this new order.

H. G. Wells wrote a book published in 1940 entitled &quot;The New World Order&quot;. It addressed the ideal of a world without war in which law and order emanated from a world governing body and examined various proposals and ideas.

Franklin D. Roosevelt in his &quot;Armistice Day Address Before the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier&quot; on November 11, 1940, referred to &quot;Novus ordo seclorum&quot;, inscribed on the Great Seal of the United States and traced to antiquity. By this phrase, Virgil announced the Augustan Golden Age. That Age was the dawn of the divine universal monarchy, but Roosevelt on that occasion promised to take the world order into the opposite democratic direction led by the United States and Britain.

On June 6, 1966, New York Senator Robert F. Kennedy used the phrase &quot;new world society&quot; in his Day of Affirmation Address in South Africa.

== Post-Cold War usage ==

The phrase &quot;new world order&quot; as used to herald in the post-Cold War era had no developed or substantive definition. There appear to have been three distinct periods in which it was progressively redefined, first by the Soviets and later by the United States before the Malta Conference and again after George H. W. Bush&#x27;s speech of September 11, 1990.
# At first, the new world order dealt almost exclusively with nuclear disarmament and security arrangements. Mikhail Gorbachev would then expand the phrase to include United Nations strengthening and great power cooperation on a range of North–South economic, and security problems. Implications for NATO, the Warsaw Pact, and European integration were subsequently included.
# The Malta Conference collected these various expectations and they were fleshed out in more detail by the press. German reunification, human rights and the polarity of the international system were then included.
# The Gulf War crisis refocused the term on superpower cooperation and regional crises. Economic North–South problems, the integration of the Soviets into the international system and the changes in economic and military polarity received greater attention.

=== Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s formulation ===
The first press reference to the phrase came from Russo-Indian talks on November 21, 1988. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi used the term in reference to the commitments made by the Soviet Union through the Declaration of Delhi of two years previous. The new world order which he describes is characterized by &quot;non-violence and the principles of peaceful coexistence&quot;. He also includes the possibility of a sustained peace, an alternative to the nuclear balance of terror, dismantling of nuclear weapons systems, significant cuts in strategic arms and eventually a general and complete disarmament.

Three days later, a &quot;Guardian&quot; article quotes NATO Secretary General Manfred Wörner as saying that the Soviets have come close to accepting NATO&#x27;s doctrine of military stability based on a mix of nuclear as well as conventional arms. In his opinion, this would spur the creation of &quot;a new security framework&quot; and a move towards &quot;a new world order&quot;.

However, the principal statement creating the new world order concept came from Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s December 7, 1988 speech to the United Nations General Assembly. His formulation included an extensive list of ideas in creating a new order. He advocated strengthening the central role of the United Nations and the active involvement of all members—the Cold War had prevented the United Nations and its Security Council from performing their roles as initially envisioned. The de-ideologizing of relations among states was the mechanism through which this new level of cooperation could be achieved. Concurrently, Gorbachev recognized only one world economy—essentially an end to economic blocs. Furthermore, he advocated Soviet entry into several important international organizations, such as the CSCE and International Court of Justice. Reinvigoration of the United Nations peacekeeping role and recognition that superpower cooperation can and will lead to the resolution of regional conflicts was especially key in his conception of cooperation. He argued that the use of force or the threat of the use of force was no longer legitimate and that the strong must demonstrate restraint toward the weak. As the major powers of the world, he foresaw the United States, the Soviet Union, Europe, India, China, Japan and Brazil. He asked for cooperation on environmental protection, on debt relief for developing countries, on disarmament of nuclear weapons, on preservation of the ABM treaty and on a convention for the elimination of chemical weapons. At the same time, he promised the significant withdrawal of Soviet forces from Eastern Europe and Asia as well as an end to the jamming of Radio Liberty.

Gorbachev described a phenomenon that could be described as a global political awakening:
In the press, Gorbachev was compared to Woodrow Wilson giving the Fourteen Points, to Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill promulgating the Atlantic Charter and to George Marshall and Harry S. Truman building the Western Alliance. While visionary, his speech was to be approached with caution as he was seen as attempting a fundamental redefinition of international relationships, on economic and environmental levels. His support &quot;for independence, democracy and social justice&quot; was highlighted, but the principle message taken from his speech was that of a new world order based on pluralism, tolerance and cooperation.
A month later, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; ran a longer analysis of the speech and its possible implications. The promises of a new world order based on the forswearing of military use of force was viewed partially as a threat, which might &quot;lure the West toward complacency&quot; and &quot;woo Western Europe into neutered neutralism&quot;. However, the more overriding threat was that the West did not yet have any imaginative response to Gorbachev—leaving the Soviets with the moral initiative and solidifying Gorbachev&#x27;s place as &quot;the most popular world leader in much of Western Europe&quot;. The article noted as important his de-ideologized stance, willingness to give up use of force, commitment to troop cuts in Eastern Europe (accelerating political change there) and compliance with the ABM treaty. According to the article, the new world order seemed to imply shifting of resources from military to domestic needs; a world community of states based on the rule of law; a dwindling of security alliances like NATO and the Warsaw Pact; and an inevitable move toward European integration. The author of the &quot;Time&quot; article felt that George H. W. Bush should counter Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;common home&quot; rhetoric toward the Europeans with the idea of &quot;common ideals&quot;, turning an alliance of necessity into one of shared values. Gorbachev&#x27;s repudiation of expansionism leaves the United States in a good position, no longer having to support anti-communist dictators and able to pursue better goals such as the environment; nonproliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; reducing famine and poverty; and resolving regional conflicts. In &quot;A World Transformed&quot;, Bush and Brent Scowcroft&#x27;s similarly concern about losing leadership to Gorbachev is noted and they worry that the Europeans might stop following the U.S. if it appears to drag its feet.

As Europe passed into the new year, the implications of the new world order for the European Community surfaced. The European Community was seen as the vehicle for integrating East and West in such a manner that they could &quot;pool their resources and defend their specific interests in dealings with those superpowers on something more like equal terms&quot;. It would be less exclusively tied to the U.S. and stretch &quot;from Brest to Brest-Litovsk, or at least from Dublin to Lublin&quot;. By July 1989, newspapers were still criticizing Bush for his lack of response to Gorbachev&#x27;s proposals. Bush visited Europe, but &quot;left undefined for those on both sides of the Iron Curtain his vision for the new world order&quot;, leading commentators to view the U.S. as over-cautious and reactive, rather than pursuing long-range strategic goals.

=== Malta Conference ===

In &quot;A World Transformed&quot;, Bush and Scowcroft detail their crafting of a strategy aimed at flooding Gorbachev with proposals at the Malta Conference to catch him off guard, preventing the U.S. from coming out of the summit on the defensive.

The Malta Conference on December 2–3, 1989 reinvigorated discussion of the new world order. Various new concepts arose in the press as elements on the new order. Commentators expected the replacement of containment with superpower cooperation. This cooperation might then tackle problems such as reducing armaments and troop deployments, settling regional disputes, stimulating economic growth, lessening East–West trade restrictions, the inclusion of the Soviets in international economic institutions and protecting the environment. Pursuant to superpower cooperation, a new role for NATO was forecast, with the organization perhaps changing into a forum for negotiation and treaty verification, or even a wholesale dissolution of NATO and the Warsaw Pact following the resurrection of the four-power framework from World War II (i.e. the United States, United Kingdom, France and Russia). However, continued U.S. military presence in Europe was expected to help contain &quot;historic antagonisms&quot;, thus making possible a new European order.

In Europe, German reunification was seen as part of the new order. However, Strobe Talbott saw it as more of a brake on the new era and believed Malta to be a holding action on part of the superpowers designed to forestall the &quot;new world order&quot; because of the German question. Political change in Eastern Europe also arose on the agenda. The Eastern Europeans believed that the new world order did not signify superpower leadership, but that superpower dominance was coming to an end.

In general, the new security structure arising from superpower cooperation seemed to indicate to observers that the new world order would be based on the principles of political liberty, self-determination and non-intervention. This would mean an end to the sponsoring of military conflicts in third countries, restrictions on global arms sales, and greater engagement in the Middle East (especially regarding Syria, Palestine and Israel). The U.S. might use this opportunity to more emphatically promote human rights in China and South Africa.

Economically, debt relief was expected to be a significant issue as East–West competition would give way to North–South cooperation. Economic tripolarity would arise with the U.S., Germany and Japan as the three motors of world growth. Meanwhile, the Soviet social and economic crisis was manifestly going to limit its ability to project power abroad, thus necessitating continued U.S. leadership.

Commentators assessing the results of the Conference and how the pronouncements measured up to expectations, were underwhelmed. Bush was criticized for taking refuge behind notions of &quot;status quo-plus&quot; rather than a full commitment to new world order. Others noted that Bush thus far failed to satisfy the out-of-control &quot;soaring expectations&quot; that Gorbachev&#x27;s speech unleashed.

=== Gulf War and Bush&#x27;s formulation ===

Bush started to take the initiative from Gorbachev during the run-up to the Persian Gulf War, when he began to define the elements of the new world order as he saw it and link the new order&#x27;s success to the international community&#x27;s response in Kuwait.

Initial agreement by the Soviets to allow action against Saddam Hussein highlighted this linkage in the press. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared that this superpower cooperation demonstrates that the Soviet Union has joined the international community and that in the new world order Saddam faces not just the U.S., but the international community itself. A &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial was the first to assert that at stake in the collective response to Saddam was &quot;nothing less than the new world order which Bush and other leaders struggle to shape&quot;.

In &quot;A World Transformed&quot;, Scowcroft notes that Bush even offered to have Soviet troops amongst the coalition forces liberating Kuwait. Bush places the fate of the new world order on the ability of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to respond to Hussein&#x27;s aggression. The idea that the Persian Gulf War would usher in the new world order began to take shape. Bush notes that the &quot;premise [was] that the United States henceforth would be obligated to lead the world community to an unprecedented degree, as demonstrated by the Iraqi crisis, and that we should attempt to pursue our national interests, wherever possible, within a framework of concert with our friends and the international community&quot;.

On March 6, 1991, President Bush addressed Congress in a speech often cited as the Bush administration&#x27;s principal policy statement on the new world order in the Middle East following the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Michael Oren summarizes the speech, saying: &quot;The president proceeded to outline his plan for maintaining a permanent U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf, for providing funds for Middle East development, and for instituting safeguards against the spread of unconventional weapons. The centerpiece of his program, however, was the achievement of an Arab-Israeli treaty based on the territory-for-peace principle and the fulfillment of Palestinian rights&quot;. As a first step, Bush announced his intention to reconvene the international peace conference in Madrid.

A pivotal point came with Bush&#x27;s September 11, 1990 &quot;Toward a New World Order&quot; speech () to a joint session of Congress. This time it was Bush, not Gorbachev, whose idealism was compared to Woodrow Wilson and to Franklin D. Roosevelt at the creation of the United Nations. Key points picked up in the press were:
* Commitment to U.S. strength, such that it can lead the world toward rule of law, rather than use of force. The Gulf crisis was seen as a reminder that the U.S. must continue to lead and that military strength does matter, but that the resulting new world order should make military force less important in the future.
* Soviet–American partnership in cooperation toward making the world safe for democracy, making possible the goals of the United Nations for the first time since its inception. Some countered that this was unlikely and that ideological tensions would remain, such that the two superpowers could be partners of convenience for specific and limited goals only. The inability of the Soviet Union to project force abroad was another factor in skepticism toward such a partnership.
* Another caveat raised was that the new world order was based not on U.S.-Soviet cooperation, but really on Bush-Gorbachev cooperation and that the personal diplomacy made the entire concept exceedingly fragile.
* Future cleavages were to be economic, not ideological, with the First and Second World cooperating to contain regional instability in the Third World. Russia could become an ally against economic assaults from Asia, Islamic terrorism and drugs from Latin America.
* Soviet integration into world economic institutions such as the G7 and establishment of ties with the European Community.
* Restoration of German sovereignty and Cambodia&#x27;s acceptance of the United Nations Security Council&#x27;s peace plan on the day previous to the speech were seen as signs of what to expect in the new world order.
* The reemergence of Germany and Japan as members of the great powers and concomitant reform of the United Nations Security Council was seen as necessary for great power cooperation and reinvigorated United Nations leadership
* Europe was seen as taking the lead on building their own world order while the U.S. was relegated to the sidelines. The rationale for U.S. presence on the continent was vanishing and the Persian Gulf crisis was seen as incapable of rallying Europe. Instead, Europe was discussing the European Community, the CSCE and relations with the Soviet Union. Gorbachev even proposed an all-European security council to replace the CSCE, in effect superseding the increasingly irrelevant NATO.
* A very few postulated a bi-polar new order of U.S. power and United Nations moral authority, the first as global policeman, the second as global judge and jury. The order would be collectivist in which decisions and responsibility would be shared.
These were the common themes which emerged from reporting about Bush&#x27;s speech and its implications.

Critics held that Bush and Baker remained too vague about what exactly the order entailed:
&quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that the American left was calling the new world order a &quot;rationalization for imperial ambitions&quot; in the Middle East while the right rejected new security arrangements altogether and fulminated about any possibility of United Nations revival. Pat Buchanan predicted that the Persian Gulf War would in fact be the demise of the new world order, the concept of United Nations peacekeeping and the U.S.&#x27;s role as global policeman.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the speech signified more than just the rhetoric about superpower cooperation. In fact, the deeper reality of the new world order was the U.S.&#x27; emergence &quot;as the single greatest power in a multipolar world&quot;. Moscow was crippled by internal problems and thus unable to project power abroad. While hampered by economic malaise, the U.S. was militarily unconstrained for the first time since the end of World War II. Militarily, it was now a unipolar world as illustrated by the Persian Gulf crisis. While diplomatic rhetoric stressed a U.S.-Soviet partnership, the U.S. was deploying troops to Saudi Arabia (a mere 700 miles from the Soviet frontier) and was preparing for war against a former Soviet client state. Further, U.S. authority over the Soviets was displayed in 1. The unification of Germany, withdrawal of Soviet forces, and almost open appeal to Washington for aid in managing the Soviet transition to democracy; 2. Withdrawal of Soviet support for Third World clients; and 3) Soviets seeking economic aid through membership in Western international economic and trade communities.

The speech was indeed pivotal but the meaning hidden. A pivotal interpretation of the speech came the same month a week later on September 18, 1990. Charles Krauthammer then delivered a lecture in Washington in which he introduced the idea of American unipolarity. By the fall 1990, his essay was published in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; titled &quot;The Unipolar Moment&quot;. It had little to do with Kuwait. The main point was the following:
In fact, as Lawrence Freedman commented in 1991, a &quot;unipolar&quot; world is now taken seriously. He details:
Washington&#x27;s capacity to exert overwhelming military power and leadership over a multinational coalition provides the &quot;basis for a &quot;Pax Americana&quot;&quot;. Indeed, one of the problems with Bush&#x27;s phrase was that &quot;a call for &#x27;order&#x27; from Washington chills practically everyone else, because it sounds suspiciously like a &quot;Pax Americana&quot;&quot;. The unipolarity, Krauthammer noted, is the &quot;most striking feature of the post-Cold War world&quot;. The article proved to be epochal. Twelve years later, Krauthammer in &quot;The Unipolar Moment Revisited&quot; stated that the &quot;moment&quot; is lasting and lasting with &quot;acceleration&quot;. He replied to those who still refused to acknowledge the fact of unipolarity: &quot;If today&#x27;s American primacy does not constitute unipolarity, then nothing ever will&quot;. In 1990, Krauthammer had estimated that the &quot;moment&quot; will last forty years at best, but he adjusted the estimation in 2002: &quot;Today, it seems rather modest. The unipolar moment has become the unipolar era&quot;. On the latter occasion, Krauthammer added perhaps his most significant comment—the new unipolar world order represents a &quot;unique to modern history&quot; structure.

==== Presaging the Iraq War of 2003 ====

&quot;The Economist&quot; published an article explaining the drive toward the Persian Gulf War in terms presaging the run-up to the Iraq War of 2003. The author notes directly that despite the coalition, in the minds of most governments this is the U.S.&#x27; war and George W. Bush that &quot;chose to stake his political life on defeating Mr Hussein&quot;. An attack on Iraq would certainly shatter Bush&#x27;s alliance, they assert, predicting calls from United Nations Security Council members saying that diplomacy should have been given more time and that they will not wish to allow a course of action &quot;that leaves America sitting too prettily as sole remaining superpower&quot;. When the unanimity of the Security Council ends, &quot;all that lovely talk about the new world order&quot; will too. When casualties mount, &quot;Bush will be called a warmonger, an imperialist and a bully&quot;. The article goes on to say that Bush and James Baker&#x27;s speechifying cannot save the new world order once they launch a controversial war. It closes noting that a wide consensus is not necessary for U.S. action—only a hardcore of supporters, namely Gulf Cooperation Council states (including Saudi Arabia), Egypt and Britain. The rest need only not interfere.

In a passage with similar echoes of the future, Bush and Scowcroft explain in &quot;A World Transformed&quot; the role of the United Nations Secretary-General in attempting to avert the Persian Gulf War. Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar arrived at Camp David to ask what he could do to head off the war. Bush told him that it was important that we get full implementation on every United Nations resolution: &quot;If we compromise, we weaken the UN and our own credibility in building this new world order,&quot; I said. &quot;I think Saddam Hussein doesn&#x27;t believe force will be used—or if it is, he can produce a stalemate&quot;. Additional meetings between Baker or Pérez and the Iraqis are rejected for fear that they will simply come back empty-handed once again. Bush feared that Javier will be cover for Hussein&#x27;s manipulations. Pérez suggested another Security Council meeting, but Bush saw no reason for one.

=== Following the Persian Gulf War ===
Following the Persian Gulf War which was seen as the crucible in which great power cooperation and collective security would emerge the new norms of the era—several academic assessments of the &quot;new world order&quot; idea were published.

John Lewis Gaddis, a Cold War historian, wrote in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; about what he saw as the key characteristics of the potential new order, namely unchallenged American primacy, increasing integration, resurgent nationalism and religiosity, a diffusion of security threats and collective security. He casts the fundamental challenge as one of integration versus fragmentation and the concomitant benefits and dangers associated with each. Changes in communications, the international economic system, the nature of security threats and the rapid spread of new ideas would prevent nations from retreating into isolation. In light of this, Gaddis sees a chance for the democratic peace predicted by liberal international relations theorists to come closer to reality. However, he illustrates that not only is the fragmentary pressure of nationalism manifest in the former Communist bloc countries and the Third World, but it is also a considerable factor in the West. Further, a revitalized Islam could play both integrating and fragmenting roles—emphasizing common identity, but also contributing to new conflicts that could resemble the Lebanese Civil War. The integration coming from the new order could also aggravate ecological, demographic and epidemic threats. National self-determination, leading to the breakup and reunification of states (such as Yugoslavia on one hand and Germany on the other) could signal abrupt shifts in the balance of power with a destabilizing effect. Integrated markets, especially energy markets, are now a security liability for the world economic system as events affecting energy security in one part of the globe could threaten countries far removed from potential conflicts. Finally, diffusion of security threats required a new security paradigm involving low-intensity, but more frequent deployment of peacekeeping troops—a type of mission that is hard to sustain under budgetary or public opinion pressure. Gaddis called for aid to Eastern European countries, updated security and economic regimes for Europe, United Nations-based regional conflict resolution, a slower pace of international economic integration and paying off the U.S. debt.

However, statesman Strobe Talbott wrote of the new world order that it was only in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War that the United Nations took a step toward redefining its role to take account of both interstate relations and intrastate events. Furthermore, he asserted that it was only as an unintended postscript to Desert Storm that Bush gave meaning to the &quot;new world order&quot; slogan. By the end of the year, Bush stopped talking about a new world order and his advisers explained that he had dropped the phrase because he felt it suggested more enthusiasm for the changes sweeping the planet than he actually felt. As an antidote to the uncertainties of the world, he wanted to stress the old verities of territorial integrity, national sovereignty and international stability. David Gergen suggested at the time that it was the recession of 1991–1992 which finally killed the new world order idea within the White House. The economic downturn took a deeper psychological toll than expected while domestic politics were increasingly frustrated by paralysis, with the result that the United States toward the end of 1991 turned increasingly pessimistic, inward and nationalistic.

In 1992, Hans Köchler published a critical assessment of the notion of the &quot;new world order&quot;, describing it as an ideological tool of legitimation of the global exercise of power by the U.S. in a unipolar environment. In Joseph Nye&#x27;s analysis (1992), the collapse of the Soviet Union did not issue in a new world order per se, but rather simply allowed for the reappearance of the liberal institutional order that was supposed to have come into effect in 1945. However, this success of this order was not a fait accomplis. Three years later, John Ikenberry would reaffirm Nye&#x27;s idea of a reclamation of the ideal post-World War II order, but would dispute the nay-sayers who had predicted post-Cold War chaos. By 1997, Anne-Marie Slaughter produced an analysis calling the restoration of the post-World War II order a &quot;chimera ... infeasible at best and dangerous at worst&quot;. In her view, the new order was not a liberal institutionalist one, but one in which state authority disaggregated and decentralized in the face of globalization.

Samuel Huntington wrote critically of the &quot;new world order&quot; and of Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s &quot;End of History&quot; theory in &quot;The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order&quot;:
:The expectation of harmony was widely shared. Political and intellectual leaders elaborated similar views. The Berlin wall had come down, communist regimes had collapsed, the United Nations was to assume a new importance, the former Cold War rivals would engage in &quot;partnership&quot; and a &quot;grand bargain,&quot; peacekeeping and peacemaking would be the order of the day. The President of the world&#x27;s leading country proclaimed the &quot;new world order&quot;...
:The moment of euphoria at the end of the Cold War generated an illusion of harmony, which was soon revealed to be exactly that. The world became different in the early 1990s, but not necessarily more peaceful. Change was inevitable; progress was not... The illusion of harmony at the end of that Cold War was soon dissipated by the multiplication of ethnic conflicts and &quot;ethnic cleansing,&quot; the breakdown of law and order, the emergence of new patterns of alliance and conflict among states, the resurgence of neo-communist and neo-fascist movements, intensification of religious fundamentalism, the end of the &quot;diplomacy of smiles&quot; and &quot;policy of yes&quot; in Russia&#x27;s relations with the West, the inability of the United Nations and the United States to suppress bloody local conflicts, and the increasing assertiveness of a rising China. In the five years after the Berlin wall came down, the word &quot;genocide&quot; was heard far more often than in any five years of the Cold War.
:The one harmonious world paradigm is clearly far too divorced from reality to be a useful guide to the post–Cold War world. Two Worlds: Us and Them. While one-world expectations appear at the end of major conflicts, the tendency to think in terms of two worlds recurs throughout human history. People are always tempted to divide people into us and them, the in-group and the other, our civilization and those barbarians.

Despite the criticisms of the new world order concept, ranging from its practical unworkability to its theoretical incoherence, Bill Clinton not only signed on to the idea of the &quot;new world order&quot;, but dramatically expanded the concept beyond Bush&#x27;s formulation. The essence of Clinton&#x27;s election year critique was that Bush had done too little, not too much.

American intellectual Noam Chomsky, author of the 1994 book &quot;World Orders Old and New&quot;, often describes the &quot;new world order&quot; as a post-Cold-War era in which &quot;the New World gives the orders&quot;. Commenting on the 1999 U.S.-NATO bombing of Serbia, he writes:
Following the rise of Boris Yeltsin eclipsing Gorbachev and the election victory of Clinton over Bush, the term &quot;new world order&quot; fell from common usage. It was replaced by competing similar concepts about how the post-Cold War order would develop. Prominent among these were the ideas of the &quot;era of globalization&quot;, the &quot;unipolar moment&quot;, the &quot;end of history&quot; and the &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot;.

=== Viewed in retrospect ===
A 2001 paper in &quot;Presidential Studies Quarterly&quot; examined the idea of the &quot;new world order&quot; as it was presented by the Bush administration (mostly ignoring previous uses by Gorbachev). Their conclusion was that Bush really only ever had three firm aspects to the new world order:
# Checking the offensive use of force.
# Promoting collective security.
# Using great power cooperation.

These were not developed into a policy architecture, but came about incrementally as a function of domestic, personal and global factors. Because of the somewhat overblown expectations for the new world order in the media, Bush was widely criticized for lacking vision.

The Gulf crisis is seen as the catalyst for Bush&#x27;s development and implementation of the new world order concept. The authors note that before the crisis the concept remained &quot;ambiguous, nascent, and unproven&quot; and that the U.S. had not assumed a leadership role with respect to the new order. Essentially, the Cold War&#x27;s end was the permissive cause for the new world order, but the Persian Gulf crisis was the active cause.
They reveal that in August 1990 U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Charles W. Freeman Jr. sent a diplomatic cable to Washington from Saudi Arabia in which he argued that U.S. conduct in the Persian Gulf crisis would determine the nature of the world. Bush would then refer to the &quot;new world order&quot; at least 42 times from the summer of 1990 to the end of March 1991. They also note that Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney gave three priorities to the Senate on fighting the Persian Gulf War, namely prevent further aggression, protect oil supplies and further a new world order. The authors note that the new world order did not emerge in policy speeches until after Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, maintaining that the concept was clearly not critical in the U.S. decision to deploy. John H. Sununu later indicated that the administration wanted to refrain from talking about the concept until Soviet collapse was more clear. A reversal of Soviet collapse would have been the death knell for the new order.

Bush and Scowcroft were frustrated by the exaggerated and distorted ideas surrounding the new world order. They did not intend to suggest that the U.S. would yield significant influence to the United Nations, or that they expected the world to enter an era of peace and tranquility. They preferred multilateralism, but did not reject unilateralism. The new world order did not signal peace, but a &quot;challenge to keep the dangers of disorder at bay&quot;.

Bush&#x27;s drive toward the Persian Gulf War was based on the world making a clear choice. Baker recalls that UNSCR 660&#x27;s &quot;language was simply and crystal clear, purposely designed by us to frame the vote as being for or against aggression&quot;. Bush&#x27;s motivation centered around 1. The dangers of appeasement; and 2. Failure to check aggression could spark further aggression. Bush repeatedly invoked images of World War II in this connection and became very emotional over Iraqi atrocities being committed in Kuwait. He also believed that failure to check Iraqi aggression would lead to more challenges to the U.S.-favored status quo and global stability. While the end of the Cold War increased U.S. security globally, it remained vulnerable to regional threats. Furthermore, Washington believed that addressing the Iraqi threat would help reassert U.S. predominance in light of growing concerns about relative decline, following the resurgence of Germany and Japan.
The Gulf War was also framed as a test case for United Nations credibility. As a model for dealing with aggressors, Scowcroft believed that the United States ought to act in a way that others can trust and thus get United Nations support. It was critical that the U.S. not look like it was throwing its weight around. Great power cooperation and United Nations support would collapse if the U.S. marched on the Baghdad to try to remake Iraq. However, practically, superpower cooperation was limited. For example, when the U.S. deployed troops to Saudi Arabia, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze became furious at not being consulted.

By 1992, the authors note that the U.S. was already abandoning the idea of collective action. The leaked draft of the Wolfowitz-Libby 1992 Defense Guidance Report effectively confirmed this shift as it called for a unilateral role for the U.S. in world affairs, focusing on preserving American dominance.

In closing &quot;A World Transformed&quot;, Scowcroft sums up what his expectations were for the new world order. He states that the U.S. has the strength and the resources to pursue its own interests, but has a disproportionate responsibility to use its power in pursuit of the common good as well as an obligation to lead and to be involved. The U.S. is perceived as uncomfortable in exercising its power and ought to work to create predictability and stability in international relations. The U.S. needs not be embroiled in every conflict, but ought to aid in developing multilateral responses to them. The U.S. can unilaterally broker disputes, but ought to act whenever possible in concert with equally committed partners to deter major aggression.

As a global hegemonic power, the American international order or the ‘liberal international order’, has defined America’s place in the world for 70 years. However, “Today it is being called into question by the rise of new forces such as China on the international scene and a new wave of populist politics within democracies.” (G. John Ikenberry, ‘The end of the liberal international order?’
Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger stated in 1994: &quot;The New World Order cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the most significant single component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions&quot;. Then on January 5, 2009, when asked on television by CNBC anchors about what he suggests U.S. President Barack Obama focus on during the current Israeli crises he replied that it is a time to reevaluate American foreign policy and that &quot;he can give new impetus to American foreign policy. ... I think that his task will be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period, when really a &#x27;new world order&#x27; can be created. It&#x27;s a great opportunity. It isn&#x27;t such a crisis.&quot;

However, this did not come to fruition, in 2009, Obama increased the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan to 68,000 troups, showing the US still acting as the global hegemon and becoming increasingly involved in the war. 

Former United Kingdom Prime Minister and British Middle East envoy Tony Blair stated on November 13, 2000, in his Mansion House speech: &quot;There is a new world order like it or not.&quot; He used the term in 2001, November 12, 2001 and 2002. On January 7, 2003, he stated that &quot;the call was for a new world order. But a new order presumes a new consensus. It presumes a shared agenda and a global partnership to do it.&quot;

Former United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) stated on December 17, 2001: &quot;This is not the first time the world has faced this question—so fundamental and far-reaching. In the 1940s, after the greatest of wars, visionaries in America and elsewhere looked ahead to a new world and—in their day and for their times—built a new world order.&quot;

The modern changes to the global order were made particularly apparent in the UK during the 2016 Brexit vote. “The European Union has the ambition to be an important factor in the global order, promoting an international system based on stronger multilateral cooperation and good global governance, and so removing the UK from the system has left the Union a diminished international actor. 

Brown also called for a &quot;new world order&quot; in a 2008 speech in New Delhi to reflect the rise of Asia and growing concerns over global warming and finance. Brown said the new world order should incorporate a better representation of &quot;the biggest shift in the balance of economic power in the world in two centuries.&quot; He went on to say: &quot;To succeed now, the post-war rules of the game and the post-war international institutions—fit for the Cold War and a world of just 50 states—must be radically reformed to fit our world of globalisation.&quot; He also called for the revamping of post-war global institutions including the World Bank, G8 and International Monetary Fund. Other elements of Brown&#x27;s formulation include spending £100 million a year on setting up a rapid reaction force to intervene in failed states.Increasing concerns over global warming have also been argued to change the international order. Sandeep Sengupta argues that the “sharp disconnect that exists between those responsible for causing the problem and those bearing its worst impacts, and the unwillingness of the former to take remedial action to the extent required.” This means the international order forms resentment, in the causation and blame for global climate change, due to the vast development gap between the developed and undeveloped countries. The 2015 Paris Agreement in particular largely witnessed pragmatism, aligned with the interests of the rich and powerful, prevail over considerations of fairness and justice, even as the inequities stemming from climate change—interstate, intrastate and intergenerational—have continued to manifest themselves and grow. Notwithstanding whatever other actions have taken place to combat climate change over this period, the core question remains: can international order be sustained without meeting basic claims of justice in global efforts to protect the planet?

He also used the term on January 14, 2007, March 12, 2007, May 15, 2007, June 20, 2007, April 15, 2008 and on April 18, 2008. Brown also used the term in his speech at the G20 Summit in London on April 2, 2009.

This poses questions about the extent to which multi-lateral agreements enforce multipolarity in the global order. Global summits such as the G series summits are essential in discussing economic and financial matters and coordinating policy on mutual interest issues. 
Agreements such as the Paris Agreement facilitate countries working together to achieve one specific aim and therefore have the potential to diminish the power of hegemons by levelling every country in terms of ensuring equality in deciding the correct course of action.
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has called for a &quot;new world order&quot; based on new ideas, saying the era of tyranny has come to a dead-end. In an exclusive interview with Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Ahmadinejad noted that it is time to propose new ideologies for running the world.

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said, &quot;It&#x27;s time to move from words to action because this is not going to go away. This nation is fighting for its survival, but we are also fighting for world peace and we are also fighting for a Future World Order.&quot;

Turkish President Abdullah Gül said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think you can control all the world from one centre. There are big nations. There are huge populations. There is unbelievable economic development in some parts of the world. So what we have to do is, instead of unilateral actions, act all together, make common decisions and have consultations with the world. A new world order, if I can say it, should emerge.&quot;

On the &quot;Colbert Report&quot;, guest John King (of CNN) mentioned Obama&#x27;s &quot;New World Order&quot; after Stephen Colbert joked about the media&#x27;s role in getting Obama elected.

Some scholars of international relations have advanced the thesis that the declining global influence of the U.S. and the rise of largely illiberal powers such as China threaten the established norms and beliefs of the liberal rule-based world order. They describe three pillars of the prevailing order that are upheld and promoted by the West, namely, peaceful international relations (the Westphalian norm), democratic ideals and free-market capitalism. Stewart Patrick suggests that emerging powers, China included, &quot;often oppose the political and economic ground rules of the inherited Western liberal order&quot; and Elizabeth Economy argues that China is becoming a &quot;revolutionary power&quot; that is seeking &quot;to remake global norms and institutions.&quot;

Russian political analyst Leonid Grinin believes that despite all the problems, the U.S. will preserve the leading position within a new world order since no other country is able to concentrate so many leader&#x27;s functions. Yet, he insists that the formation of a new world order will start from an epoch of new coalitions.

Xi Jinping, China&#x27;s paramount leader, has called for a new world order, in his speech to the Boao Forum for Asia, in April 2021. He criticized US global leadership and its interference on other countries&#x27; internal affairs. &quot;The rules set by one or several countries should not be imposed on others, and the unilateralism of individual countries should not give the whole world a rhythm,&quot; he said.

U.S. President Joe Biden said during a gathering of business leaders at the White House in March 2022 that the recent changes in global affairs caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine provided an opportunity for a new world order with U.S. leadership, stating that this project would have to be carried out in partnership with &quot;the rest of the free world.&quot;

According to Tony Blair&#x27;s the annual Ditchley lecture in July 2022, China, not Russia, will bring about the largest geopolitical change of this century. The era of western political and economic domination is coming to an end. The future of the world will be at the very least bipolar and possibly multipolar. The east and west can now coexist on equal level for the first time in contemporary history.

The role of soft power must not be overlooked by the west, according to Blair, as China and other nations like Russia, Turkey, and Iran invest money in the developing world while forging close political and military ties.
