<text>The Liiga, colloquially called the Finnish Elite League in English or FM-ligan in Swedish, is the top professional ice hockey league in Finland. The league comprises 16 teams from all around Finland with relegation and promotion between the Mestis. The winner of the Liiga playoffs is awarded the Kanada-malja at the end of each season.

Teams from the Liiga participate in the IIHF&#x27;s annual Champions Hockey League (CHL), competing for the European Trophy. Participation is based on the strength of the various leagues in Europe (excluding the European/Asian Kontinental Hockey League).

The Liiga was established in 1975 to replace the former SM-sarja, which was fundamentally an amateur competition. The Liiga is not directly overseen by the Finnish Ice Hockey Association, but the league and association have an agreement of cooperation. SM is a common abbreviation for &quot;Suomen mestaruus&quot;, &quot;Finnish Champion&quot;.

==History==
The SM-liiga was established in 1975 to replace the amateur competition SM-sarja. Kalervo Kummola was elected to become the first chief executive officer of the SM-liiga, who served until 1987. The SM-liiga wasn&#x27;t established unter the Finnish ice Hockey Association that oversees all the other leagues and cups in the country. The playoffs are introduced in Finnish ice hockey for the first time during the inaugural SM-liiga season. 

At first there were 10 clubs in the SM-liiga. The league expanded to 12 teams in the 1988–89 season. In 2000, the SM-liiga was expanded by one team, after which the league was closed so that teams could not drop out of the league or move up from a lower league. For the 2005–2006 season, the Mestis winner KalPa was promoted to the series, which met the criteria required for a place in the league. The league qualifiers were brought back for the 2008–09 season. However, as a condition for promotion, the Mestis team that cleared the qualifiers should have bought the shares of the losing Liiga team at the price determined by the league. Otherwise, the losing Liiga team would have continued playing in the league. Starting from the 2013–2014 season, the Liiga qualifiers were replaced by a license system where the winner of Mestis can apply for a Liiga license. If granted, the club will be promoted to the league after a transition period of one season.The league changed its marketing name to just Liiga for the 2013–14 season, and introduced a new logo to match. The 2019–20 Liiga season was terminated on March 13, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the decision, the final round of the regular season and the playoffs were not played, and the 2020 Finnish hockey championship was not awarded.

For the 2024–25 season, Kiekko-Espoo were promoted to the Liiga as the league expanded to 16 teams. The league was opened for relegation and promotion between the Mestis for the first time since 2013.

According to a 2023 article by &quot;The Hockey Writers&quot;, the SM-liiga is considered one of the best leagues in Europe and the world along with the Swedish Hockey League and behind the Kontinental Hockey League. Going into the 2024–25 CHL season, the Liiga was ranked the No. 3 league in Europe, allowing them to send their top four teams to compete in the CHL.

=== List of clubs ===
The team names are usually the traditional name of the club. All clubs are commonly known by the name of their team. &quot;Oy&quot; and &quot;Ab&quot; are the abbreviations for limited company in Finnish and Swedish respectively.
=== SM-liiga timeline ===
==Format==
Regular season: All teams play 60 matches. Each match consists of 60 minutes regulation time, and in the event of a tie, the winner is decided by a three-on-three sudden death, 5-minute overtime. Ties after overtime are decided by a shootout, where each team has three shooters in the beginning. If the game is tied after three shooters, the shootout will be decided by individual shooters against one another until one scores and the other does not.

&quot;Scoring:&quot; A win in regulation time is worth three points, a win by sudden death overtime two points, a loss by sudden death overtime one point and a loss in regulation time zero points. Teams will be ranked by points, and teams tied by points are ranked by the greater number of wins in regulation.

Playoffs: The four best teams at the conclusion of regular season proceed directly to quarter-finals. Teams placing between fifth and twelfth (inclusive) will play preliminary play-offs best-out-of-five – the four winners take the last four slots to quarter-finals. All series since then are best-of-seven. Losers of the semi-finals play a bronze medal match. Teams are paired up for each round according to regular season results so that the highest-ranking team will play against the lowest-ranking, second highest against the second lowest, and so on. Higher-ranking teams get home advantage. Each playoff match consists of a 60-minute regulation time which in the event of a tie is followed by extra 20-minute periods of 5-on-5 sudden death overtime, in which the first team to score wins.

Relegation: The 16th and 15th placed teams will play in the playout series to decide which team plays against the Mestis champion.

&quot;Scheduling:&quot; The regular season begins around mid-September. It takes a one-and-half-week break around the end of October to the beginning of November, when Team Finland competes in Karjala Tournament. There is a one-week Christmas break. During Winter Olympic years, a break is reserved for the Winter Olympic Games. The regular season is completed around mid-March and preliminary playoffs ensue almost immediately. The playoffs are completed by mid-April, so that all players are available for the World Championships.

==Winner==
 
The winners of the playoffs receive gold medals and the &quot;Kanada-malja&quot;, the championship trophy of the Liiga. The winners of the regular season receive a trophy (&quot;Harry Lindbladin muistopalkinto&quot;) as well, though it is considered less prestigious than the bronze medals of the playoffs.

<doc id="599391" wikidata="Q22201" url="?curid=599391" title="Jim DeMint">
<text>James Warren DeMint (born September 2, 1951) is an American businessman, author, and retired politician who served as a United States Senator from South Carolina and as president of The Heritage Foundation. A leading figure in the Tea Party movement, DeMint is a member of the Republican Party and is the founder of the Senate Conservatives Fund.

DeMint served as the United States representative for from 1999 to 2005. He was elected to the U.S. Senate from South Carolina in 2004 and reelected in 2010. DeMint served in the Senate until January 2, 2013, when he stepped down to become president of The Heritage Foundation. On May 2, 2017, DeMint resigned his position at Heritage at the request of its board. He later became a senior advisor to Citizens for Self-Governance and the founding chairman of the Conservative Partnership Institute.

==Early life and education==
DeMint was born in Greenville, South Carolina, one of four children. His parents, Betty W. (née Rawlings) and Thomas Eugene DeMint, divorced when he was five years old. Following the divorce, Betty DeMint operated a dance studio out of the family&#x27;s home.

DeMint attended Christ Church Episcopal School and Wade Hampton High School. He played drums for a cover band called Salt &amp; Pepper. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1973 from the University of Tennessee, where he was a part of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and received an MBA in 1981 from Clemson University.

== Early career ==
DeMint joined his father-in-law&#x27;s advertising firm in Greenville in 1981, working in the field of market research. In 1983, he founded The DeMint Group, a research firm with businesses, schools, colleges, and hospitals as clients.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
DeMint&#x27;s first involvement in politics began in 1992, when he was hired by Republican Representative Bob Inglis to work on his campaign for South Carolina&#x27;s Fourth Congressional District. Inglis defeated three-term incumbent Democrat Liz J. Patterson, and DeMint performed message-testing and marketing for Inglis through two more successful elections.

In 1998, Inglis ran for the U.S. Senate instead of seeking re-election to the House of Representatives. DeMint left his firm to run for Inglis&#x27; House seat. The district was considered the most Republican in the state, and it was understood that whoever won the primary would be heavily favored to be the district&#x27;s next congressman. DeMint finished second in the Republican primary behind State Senator and fellow Greenville resident Michael Fair. In the runoff, DeMint narrowly defeated Fair by 2,030 votes. He then defeated Democratic State Senator Glenn Reese with 57 percent of the vote to Reese&#x27;s 40 percent. DeMint faced no major-party opposition in 2000, and defeated an underfunded Democrat in 2002.

===Tenure===
DeMint was elected president of the freshman class of House Republicans. DeMint pledged to serve only three terms in the House.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Christian Post&quot; have described DeMint as a &quot;staunch conservative&quot;, based on his actions during his time in the House. He broke rank with his party and powerful state interests several times: DeMint was one of 34 Republicans to oppose President Bush&#x27;s No Child Left Behind program and one of 25 to oppose Medicare Part D. He sought to replace No Child Left Behind with a state-based block-grant program for schools. DeMint also worked to privatize Social Security by allowing the creation of individual investment accounts in the federal program. In 2003, DeMint sponsored legislation to allow people under the age of 55 to set aside 3 percent to 8 percent of their Social Security withholding income in personal investment accounts. DeMint was also the only South Carolina House member to vote for normalizing trade relations with China, arguing in favor of free trade between the countries. He also provided a crucial swing vote on a free trade bill regarding Caribbean countries. His votes led South Carolina&#x27;s influential textile industry to heavily oppose him in his subsequent House and Senate races.

==U.S. Senate==
===2004 election===

DeMint declared his candidacy for the Senate on December 12, 2002, after Sen. Ernest Hollings announced that he would retire after the 2004 elections. DeMint was the White House&#x27;s preferred candidate in the Republican primary.

In the Republican primary on June 8, 2004, DeMint placed a distant second, 10.3% behind former governor David Beasley and just barely ahead of Thomas Ravenel. Ravenel endorsed DeMint in the following runoff. DeMint won the runoff handily, however.

DeMint then faced Democratic state education superintendent Inez Tenenbaum in the November general election. DeMint led Tenenbaum through much of the campaign and ultimately defeated her by 9.6 percentage points. DeMint&#x27;s win meant that South Carolina was represented by two Republican senators for the first time since Reconstruction, when Thomas J. Robertson and John J. Patterson served together as senators.

DeMint stirred controversy during debates with Tenenbaum when he stated his belief that openly gay people should not be allowed to teach in public schools. When questioned by reporters, DeMint also stated that single mothers who live with their boyfriends should similarly be excluded from being educators. He later apologized for making the remarks, saying they were &quot;distracting from the main issues of the debate.&quot; He also noted that these were opinions based on his personal values, not issues he would or could deal with as a member of Congress.

===2010 election===
DeMint easily won re-nomination in the Republican Party primary. Democratic Party opponent Alvin Greene won an upset primary victory over Vic Rawl. Greene received scrutiny from Democratic Party officials, with some calling for Greene to withdraw his candidacy or be replaced on the ballot. On November 2, 2010, DeMint defeated Greene by a margin of 63% to 28%, with Green Party candidate Tom Clements receiving 9% of the vote.

===Tenure===
In his first term, DeMint was appointed to the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Joint Economic Committee, and the Special Committee on Aging. In 2006, DeMint began leading the Senate Steering Committee. DeMint also served as a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.

As a member of the 111th United States Congress, DeMint joined the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. In 2009, DeMint was one of two senators who voted against Hillary Clinton&#x27;s appointment to Secretary of State, and the next year he introduced legislation to completely repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. Later in 2010, he introduced another piece of legislation titled the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny, which aimed to require congressional approval of any major regulation change made by a federal agency. At the end of his first term, DeMint was appointed to the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee for the impeachment of federal judge Thomas Porteous.

After being re-elected in 2010, DeMint became the highest-ranking elected official associated with the Tea Party. During the first year of his second term, DeMint released a letter signed by over 30 other Senate Republicans asking the supercommittee tasked with balancing the federal budget to do so within the next 10 years, and without creating any net tax increases.

In 2012, DeMint announced his resignation from the Senate effective January 2, 2013, to take a job as president of The Heritage Foundation. On December 17, 2012, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley announced that she would name Congressman Tim Scott to fill DeMint&#x27;s vacated seat.

==Political positions==

DeMint is a member of the Republican Party and is aligned with the Tea Party movement. In 2011, DeMint was identified by &quot;Salon&quot; as one of the most conservative members of the Senate.

===Economy and budget===
Throughout his political career, DeMint has favored a type of tax reform that would replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax and, in addition, abolish the Internal Revenue Service. He has supported many changes to federal spending, such as prioritizing a balanced budget amendment instead of increasing the national debt limit. As a senator, DeMint proposed a two-year earmark ban to prevent members of Congress from spending federal money on projects in their home states. In 2008, presidential candidates John McCain, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama co-sponsored DeMint&#x27;s earmark reform proposal, although it ultimately failed to pass in the Senate. In March 2010, DeMint&#x27;s earmark reform plans were again defeated. In November of the same year, DeMint, along with nine other senators including Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, proposed another moratorium on earmarks which was adopted by Senate Republicans.

DeMint has also been a proponent of free trade agreements, advocated for the privatization of Social Security benefits, and in 2009 authored the &quot;Health Care Freedom Plan&quot;, which proposed giving tax credits to those who are unable to afford health insurance. DeMint opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health care reform efforts, saying of the Affordable Care Act, &quot;If we&#x27;re able to stop Obama on this it will be his Waterloo. It will break him.&quot;

DeMint was the sole &#x27;Nay&#x27; vote for the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008.

DeMint was opposed to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the bailouts during the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010. He also led a group of senators in opposing government loans to corporations. He supports a high level of government accountability through the auditing of federal agencies.

===Foreign policy===
In 1999, DeMint voted against the NATO intervention during the Kosovo war. DeMint voted to authorize military force in Iraq in 2002. In 2011, DeMint voted in favor of Rand Paul&#x27;s resolution opposing military involvement in Libya. He favored preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons over a policy of containment after their development.

DeMint has also expressed concern about various United Nations treaties, such as the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Law of the Sea Treaty. DeMint favors legal immigration and opposes granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. He has expressed opposition to the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 on the basis that granting amnesty to illegal immigrants may cost American taxpayers trillions of dollars.

In a May 15, 2020, editorial in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, DeMint stated that while he continued to support free trade, he was wrong about liberalizing trade with China.

===Obama administration===
In October 2009, after the Honduran Army, on orders from the Honduran Supreme Court, removed Manuel Zelaya as president, DeMint visited the country to gather information. The trip was approved by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell but opposed by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry. DeMint supported the new government, while the Obama administration favored Zelaya&#x27;s return to the presidency.

In late 2009, DeMint criticized Barack Obama for waiting eight months into his first term as president before nominating a new head of the Transportation Security Administration. After the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253 in December 2009, DeMint stated that President Obama had not put enough focus on terrorism while in office.

DeMint blamed Obama for racism in the United States. He said that Obama &quot;took race back to the &#x27;60s, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. He made everything a race issue, or at least saw it through a racial lens. The country had moved toward bending over backward to create equality. But then suddenly, with Obama, he just lit the fires. I thought when he was elected that was the big victory, that we had put racism behind us.&quot;

===Social issues===
DeMint opposes abortion except when the woman&#x27;s life is in danger and opposing research from stem cells derived from human embryos.

DeMint voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

He voted in favor of declaring English the official language of the US government. 

DeMint is firmly opposed to same-sex marriage. In his book &quot;Now or Never: Saving America from Economic Collapse&quot;, DeMint states:

DeMint also argues that same-sex marriage infringes upon religious liberty:

DeMint has repeatedly voted for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. He has also voted to ban same-sex adoption in Washington, D.C. DeMint drew considerable criticism by saying that openly gay teachers should be banned from teaching in public schools.

In a 2008 interview, DeMint said that while government does not have the right to restrict homosexuality, it also should not encourage it through legalizing same-sex marriage, due to the &quot;costly secondhand consequences&quot; to society from the prevalence of certain diseases among homosexuals. On October 1, 2010, DeMint, in comments that echoed what he had said in 2004, told a rally of his supporters that openly homosexual and unmarried sexually active people should not be teachers. In response, the National Organization for Women, the National Education Association, the gay rights group Human Rights Campaign, GOProud (a GOP group), and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force asked for DeMint&#x27;s apology.

== Later career ==
=== Senate Conservatives Fund ===

In 2008, DeMint formed the Senate Conservatives Fund (SCF), a political action committee with the intention of supporting conservative candidates that may have otherwise been overlooked by the national party. The SCF is associated with the Tea Party movement. It supports conservative Republican politicians in primary challenges and general elections. SCF states that it raised $9.1 million toward the 2010 U.S. Senate elections and which endorsed successful first-time Senate candidates Pat Toomey, Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, Marco Rubio. DeMint left SCF in 2012.

===The Heritage Foundation===

On April 4, 2013, DeMint started his first full day as president of The Heritage Foundation. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that DeMint&#x27;s predecessor at the Heritage Foundation, Edwin Feulner, was paid a base salary of $477,097 in 2010 compared to a U.S. Senator&#x27;s salary of $174,000 and that year DeMint was one of the poorest members of the Senate, with an estimated wealth of $40,501.

On May 2, 2017, DeMint was fired from The Heritage Foundation following a unanimous vote of the foundation&#x27;s board of trustees, which had lost confidence in his ability to maintain the organization&#x27;s role as a fount of conservative thinking. A public statement by the board said a thorough investigation of the foundation&#x27;s operations under DeMint found &quot;significant and worsening management issues that led to a breakdown of internal communications and cooperation.&quot; &quot;While the organization has seen many successes,&quot; the board statement said, &quot;Jim DeMint and a handful of his closest advisers failed to resolve these problems.&quot;

===Citizens for Self-Governance===
In June 2017, DeMint became a senior advisor to Citizens for Self-Governance, a group which is seeking to call a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution in order to reduce federal government spending and power. According to DeMint, &quot;The Tea Party needs a new mission. They realize that all the work they did in 2010 has not resulted in all the things they hoped for. Many of them are turning to Article V.&quot; The proposed constitutional convention would impose fiscal restraint on Washington D.C., reduce the federal government&#x27;s authority over states, and impose term limits on federal officials.

===Conservative Partnership Institute===

In 2017, DeMint founded the Conservative Partnership Institute, of which he serves as chairman. The stated purpose of the CPI is the professional development of conservative staffers and elected officials. Mark Meadows joined as senior partner in January 2021. The Save America PAC donated $1 million to the CPI.
A 2022 NPR investigation found CPI might be violating prohibitions on 501(c)(3) charities providing benefits to political parties (in this case, the Republican Party).

===2020 election results===
As part of the attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, DeMint signed a December 10, 2020, letter from the Conservative Action Project asking state legislatures in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Michigan to disregard the popular vote outcomes in each of those states and appoint slates of electors to the Electoral College in support of President Donald Trump.

== Personal life ==
DeMint&#x27;s wife, Debbie, is one of three children of the late Greenville advertising entrepreneur and South Carolina Republican figure James Marvin Henderson Sr.

<text>The Faculty of Information (or the [[Information school|iSchool]] at the [[University of Toronto]]) is an undergraduate and graduate school that offers the following programs: a Bachelor of Information (BI), a Master of Information (MI), a Master of Museum Studies (MMSt), and a PhD in information studies, as well as diploma courses. As a member of the iSchool movement, the Faculty of Information takes an interdisciplinary approach to information studies, building on its traditional strengths in library and information science, complemented by research and teaching in archives, museum studies, user experience, information systems and design, critical information studies, culture and technology, knowledge management, digital humanities, book history, data science, and other related fields. It is located on the St. George Campus, in the Claude Bissell building at 140 St. George Street, which is attached to Robarts Library and the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library.

== History ==
The Faculty of Information was founded as the University of Toronto Library School within the Ontario College of Education in 1928 and was housed at 315 Bloor Street. In 1965, the school was designated as an independent unit within the university and became known as the School of Library Science and thus moved it quarters to 167 College Street and 256 McCaul Street. In 1971, SLS moved again to its present location at 140 St. George Street. In 1972, the name changed to the Faculty of Library Science (FLS), as the school attained faculty status. The name changed again to the Faculty of Library and Information Science (FLIS) in 1982 and then the Faculty of Information Studies (FIS) in 1994. In 2005, FIS joined the iSchool movement and accordingly in 2006, it was renamed the Faculty of Information (FI).
The faculty has offered a variety of degrees since its inception, which reflect the changing requirements of entry into librarianship and more recently, into other information professions. Between 1928 and 1936, it offered one-year Diploma in Librarianship, and from 1936 to 1970, a one-year Bachelor of Library Science degree, which was accredited by the American Library Association in 1937. The late 1960s saw the emergence of the Master of Library Science (MLS) degree as the first professional degree in librarianship, which was introduced in the school in 1970 and required four semesters to complete. The doctoral program was established in 1971, with Claire England holding the first Ph.D. in library science that was awarded in Canada in 1974. In 1988, the faculty began to offer a Master of Information Science (MIS) degree. In 1995, the MLS and MIS degrees were both replaced with the Master of Information Studies (MISt) degree, which had three areas of specialization: archival studies, information systems, and library and information science. The name of the degree was changed to Master of Information (MI) in 2009. In 2019, the school welcomed the first cohort of its Bachelor of Information program.

Since 2006, when the Department of Museum Studies became part of the FIS, the faculty began to offer a Master of Museum Studies degree.

== Programs ==

The Faculty of Information currently offers one bachelor&#x27;s degree, Bachelor of Information (BI), and two master&#x27;s degrees, Master of Information (MI) and Master of Museum Studies (MMSt), which are also offered together as a combined degree program (CDP). In addition, students can also enroll in a Ph.D. program.

*Bachelor of Information (BI)
*Master of Information (MI)
**Archives and Records Management (ARM)
**Critical Information Policy Studies (CIPS)

=== Combined Degree Program (CDP) ===
This program permits graduate students to complete a Masters of Information (MI) and a Masters of Museum Studies (MMSt) concurrently within the span of three years. This option was changed from Concurrent Registration Option (CRO) to Combined Degree Program (CDP) beginning in September 2018.

=== PhD Program ===
The Faculty of Information also offers a PhD program in information studies, with seven available specializations: Critical Information Studies, Library &amp; Information Science, Archives &amp; Records Management, Information Systems, Media &amp; Design, Cultural Heritage, Knowledge Management &amp; Information Management, and Philosophy of Information.

=== Collaborative Programs ===
Collaborative programs are open to all students enrolled in the MI and Ph.D. programs. They are designed to allow students to focus on specialized subject interests and since they are a result of cooperation between different graduate units at the university, separate admission process is required of those who wish enter them. Currently, there are eight collaborative programs available: Book History and Print Culture, based at Massey College, Knowledge Media Design, Addiction Studies, Aging, Palliative and Supportive Care Across the Life Course, Centre for Environment, Knowledge Media Design, Sexual Diversity Studies, Women&#x27;s Health, and Women and Gender Studies.

MMSt students are allowed to enroll in Book History and Print Culture, Jewish Studies, and Sexual Diversity Studies programs.

=== Graduate Diploma ===
The iSchool offers a Graduate Diploma in Advanced Study in Information Studies (DAIS), which is for information professionals who want to add to their knowledge without taking a full PhD program. The diploma is only open to those who have a related master&#x27;s degree.

=== Undergraduate Program ===
The Bachelor of Information, first offered in 2019, is one of the first of its kind offering undergraduate students an interdisciplinary space to collaborate on work, engage with concepts from a variety of fields, explore professional experiences, and engage in design work.

== Facilities ==
The iSchool occupies all seven floors of the Claude Bissell building, which is attached to the John P. Robarts Research Library and the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. The building houses classrooms, administration, faculty offices, as well as the Inforum.
=== Inforum ===
The Inforum was the former library and &quot;academic and community hub&quot; at the FI. It contained a specialized collection devoted to the studies at the FI, including library and information science, archival studies, knowledge management, information systems and design, museum studies, and other related areas. It also included a special collection on subject analysis system. The library collection was removed in August 2019, despite advocacy efforts by the community to save the collection. In 2020, the Inforum became a Student Services space. Since 2021, it has been styled as &quot;the learning hub&quot;.

=== Semaphore Lab ===
Semaphore Lab is a research cluster dedicated to inclusive design in the area of mobile and pervasive computing. Launched in 2012, it shares space with the Critical Making Lab in Robarts Library.

=== ThingTank Lab ===
The ThingTank lab originated in 2009 as the Designing Digital Media for the Internet of Things (DDiMIT). In 2010, the lab was funded and renamed to ThingTank. The lab is located off-campus, on Bathurst Street in Toronto. The lab offers workshops, idea jams and roundtable events aimed at supporting activity in exploration and development of internet enabled “things.” The lab use is not restricted to University of Toronto faculty and students, but open to other universities, and those in the public and private sectors.

== Institutes ==

=== Knowledge Media Design Institute===
The Knowledge Media Design Institute (KMDI) was founded in 1996 as the University of Toronto&#x27;s first virtual institute. KMDI offers one of the collaborative programs available to graduate students at the University of Toronto. The current Director of KMDI is Dr. Mary Elizabeth Luka.

=== The McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology ===

Located in the historic McLuhan Coach House, the centre was first launched in 1963 as the Centre for Culture and Technology. The Centre joined the Faculty of Information as a distinct research and teaching unit in 1994, and was renamed as The McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology in June 2016. The McLuhan Centre is the home of the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology, which aims to encourage understanding of the impact of technology on our culture and society. The Interim Director of The McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology is Seamus Ross and the Director of the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology is Sarah Sharma.

==Journals==
=== &quot;Faculty of Information Quarterly&quot; ===

The &quot;Faculty of Information Quarterly&quot; (&quot;F/IQ&quot;), is a scholarly, peer-reviewed, open-access e-journal founded and operated entirely by students at the FI. The mission of &quot;F/IQ&quot; is to create an intellectual space for the information community to analyse and critically assess the divergent topics that comprise the field&#x27;s study and practice, and to define and direct the iSchool movement through scholarly and professional communications as a means to fostering collective identity among students, faculty and practitioners of the field. &quot;F/IQ&quot; was first published in October, 2008.

The journal accepts submissions from both established and emerging scholars and practitioners in information-related fields, such as archival science, information systems, library science, museum studies and others.

Published four times a year, &quot;F/IQ&quot; includes original research, guest editorials, interviews with senior scholars and professionals in the field, and book reviews. It uses Open Journal Systems (OJS) for publishing.

===&quot;The iJournal&quot;===
The &quot;iJournal&quot; is the University of Toronto (U of T) Faculty of Information&#x27;s (iSchool) open access academic journal. Founded in 2016, it is written, edited, directed, designed and produced by (mostly graduate) students at the Faculty of Information. The topics of the &quot;iJournal&quot; reflects the multiple disciplines that make up the information sciences taught at the Faculty. As of March 2022, the &quot;iJournal&quot; has published seventeen issues, including one special edition (summer 2017) and three (2016, 2018, 2019) iSchool Student Conference proceedings.

== Alumni Association ==
The &quot;Faculty of Information Alumni Association&quot; (FIAA) was first founded in 1929 and represents over 6,700 graduates of the FI. It sponsors a number of events and programs, including &quot;Job Shadowing&quot; and publishes an online magazine, &quot;Informed&quot;, dedicated to news about the FI, faculty and alumni.

<doc id="599416" wikidata="Q303486" url="?curid=599416" title="Boatswain">
<text>A boatswain ( , ), bo&#x27;s&#x27;n, bos&#x27;n, or bosun, also known as a deck boss, or a qualified member of the deck department, is the most senior rate of the deck department and is responsible for the components of a ship&#x27;s hull. The boatswain supervises the other members of the ship&#x27;s deck department, and typically is not a watchstander, except on vessels with small crews. Additional duties vary depending upon ship, crew, and circumstances.

==History==

The word &quot;boatswain&quot; has been in the English language since approximately 1450. It is derived from late Old English &quot;batswegen&quot;, from &quot;bat&quot; (&quot;boat&quot;) concatenated with Old Norse &quot;sveinn&quot; (&quot;&quot;), meaning a young man, apprentice, a follower, retainer or servant. Directly translated to modern Norwegian it would be &quot;båtsvenn&quot;, while the actual crew title in Norwegian is &quot;båtsmann&quot; (&quot;boats-man&quot;). While the phonetic spelling &quot;bosun&quot; is reported as having been observed since 1868, this latter spelling was used in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; written in 1611, and as &quot;bos&#x27;n&quot; in later editions.

===Royal Navy===
The rank of boatswain is the oldest rank in the Royal Navy, and its origins can be traced back to the year 1040. In that year, when five English ports began furnishing warships to King Edward the Confessor in exchange for certain privileges, they also furnished crews whose officers were the master, boatswain, carpenter, and cook. Later these officers were warranted by the British Admiralty. They maintained and sailed the ships and were the standing officers of the navy. The boatswain was the officer responsible for the care of the rigging, cordage, anchors, sails, boats, flags and other stores.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s last official boatswain, Commander E.W. Andrew OBE, retired in 1990. However, most RN vessels still have a Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate (or &quot;Buffer&quot;), who is the most senior rating in the Seaman Specialist department.

==Naval cadets==
The rank of cadet boatswain, in some schools, is the second highest rank in the combined cadet force naval section that a cadet can attain, below the rank of coxswain and above the rank of leading hand. It is equivalent to the rank of colour sergeant in the army and the royal marines cadets; it is sometimes an appointment for a senior petty officer to assist a coxswain.

==Job description==

The boatswain works in a ship&#x27;s deck department as the foreman of the unlicensed (crew members without a mate&#x27;s licence) deck crew. Sometimes, the boatswain is also a third or fourth mate. A boatswain must be highly skilled in all matters of marlinespike seamanship required for working on deck of a seagoing vessel. The boatswain is distinguished from other able seamen by the supervisory roles: planning, scheduling, and assigning work.

As deck crew foreman, the boatswain plans the day&#x27;s work and assigns tasks to the deck crew. As work is completed, the boatswain checks on completed work for compliance with approved operating procedures.

Outside the supervisory role, the boatswain regularly inspects the vessel and performs a variety of routine, skilled, and semi-skilled duties to maintain all areas of the ship not maintained by the engine department. These duties can include cleaning, painting, and maintaining the vessel&#x27;s hull, superstructure and deck equipment as well as executing a formal preventive maintenance program.

A boatswain&#x27;s skills may include cargo rigging, winch operations, deck maintenance, working aloft, and other duties required during deck operations. The boatswain is well versed in the care and handling of lines, and has knowledge of knots, hitches, bends, whipping, and splices as needed to perform tasks such as mooring a vessel. The boatswain typically operates the ship&#x27;s windlasses when letting go and heaving up anchors. Moreover, a boatswain may be called upon to lead firefighting efforts or other emergency procedures encountered on board. Effective boatswains are able to integrate their seafarer skills into supervising and communicating with members of deck crew with often diverse backgrounds.

Originally, on board sailing ships, the boatswain was in charge of a ship&#x27;s anchors, cordage, colours, deck crew and the ship&#x27;s boats. The boatswain would also be in charge of the rigging while the ship was in dock. The boatswain&#x27;s technical tasks were modernised with the advent of steam engines and subsequent mechanisation.

A boatswain also is responsible for doing routine pipes using what is called a boatswain&#x27;s call. There are different calls for various events, such as emergency situations or meal times.

==Notable boatswains==

A number of boatswains and naval boatswains mates have achieved fame. Reuben James and William Wiley are famous for their heroism in the Barbary Wars and are namesakes of the ships USS &quot;Reuben James&quot; and USS &quot;Wiley&quot;. Medal of Honor recipients Francis P. Hammerberg and George Robert Cholister were U.S. Navy boatswain&#x27;s mates, as was Navy Cross recipient Stephen Bass. Victoria Cross recipients John Sheppard, John Sullivan, Henry Curtis, and John Harrison were Royal Navy boatswain&#x27;s mates.

During World War II Bosun John Crisp RN is credited in &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; by escapee Pat Reid as providing, whilst a prisoner of war at Oflag IV-C, Colditz Castle, the expertise and enthusiasm to manufacture torn and then woven &quot;bedsheet ropes&quot;, tested for appropriate strength, using his extensive maritime experience.

There are also a handful of boatswains and boatswain&#x27;s mates in literature. The boatswain in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; is a central character in the opening scene, which takes place aboard a ship at sea, and appears again briefly in the final scene. &quot;Typhoon&quot; by Joseph Conrad has a nameless boatswain who tells Captain MacWhirr of a &quot;lump&quot; of men going overboard during the peak of the storm. Also, the character Bill Bobstay in Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; is alternatively referred to as a &quot;bos&#x27;un&quot; and a &quot;boatswain&#x27;s mate&quot;. Another boatswain from literature is Smee from &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. Lord Byron had a Newfoundland dog named Boatswain. Byron wrote the famous poem &quot;Epitaph to a Dog&quot; and had a monument made for him at Newstead Abbey. The 1907 naval gothic novel &quot;The Boats of the &quot;Glen Carrig&quot;&quot; by William Hope Hodgson features the character of the ship&#x27;s “bo&#x27;sun” as an important member of the crew and a personal friend to the narrator.

Billy Bones was a boatswain in the fictional Starz TV show &quot;Black Sails&quot;.

==Scouting==
Quartermaster is the highest rank in the Sea Scouts, BSA, an older youth (13–21) co-ed programme. The youth can also elect a youth leader, giving that youth the title &quot;boatswain&quot;. In the Netherlands, a boatswain (Bootsman) is the patrol leader of a Sea Scout patrol (Bak); in Flanders, it is the assistant patrol leader of a Sea Scout patrol (Kwartier).

<text>Alexandra Christina, Countess of Frederiksborg, , formerly Princess Alexandra of Denmark (&quot;née&quot; Manley; born 30 June 1964), is the former wife of Prince Joachim of Denmark, the younger brother of King Frederik X of Denmark.

She was born in Hong Kong, and is of mixed Asian and European ancestry. She was introduced to Prince Joachim in 1994. They married in 1995, and had two sons together, then divorced in 2005.

==Early life and family==
Of English, Chinese, and Austrian ancestry, Alexandra Manley was born in Hong Kong, as the eldest of three daughters of Richard Nigel Manley (11 August 1924 – 12 January 2010) and Christa Maria Manley (née Nowotny; 1933 – 5 January 2023). Her father was an insurance company executive and her mother was the manager of a communications company. She was baptized at the Cathedral of Saint John, Hong Kong. She attended Quarry Bay Junior School (1969–1971), Glenealy School (1971–1974) and Island School (1974–1982), all in Hong Kong.

Manley studied international business at Vienna University of Economics and Business in Austria. She also went to Japan and England for studies. It is not known whether she obtained a university degree. From 1990 to 1995, she was employed by GT Management (Asia) Ltd., Hong Kong, where from 1990 to 1993 she worked in Sales and Marketing and from 1993 as a deputy chief executive of that department.

==First marriage and children==
Alexandra met Prince Joachim at a private dinner in Hong Kong in January 1994, where he was working for a Danish shipping company. After a whirlwind courtship, thought to have begun in late 1994, Prince Joachim presented Alexandra with a diamond and ruby engagement ring while on vacation in the Philippines. Their engagement was officially announced in May 1995.

They were married on 18 November 1995, by Queen Margrethe&#x27;s Chaplain-in-Ordinary, in Frederiksborg Castle Church, the Chapel of the Order of the Elephant, in Hillerød. The wedding festivities were held at Fredensborg Palace. The bride&#x27;s gown was designed by Jørgen Bender and she wore the Alexandrine Drop Tiara, originally the property of Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which was a wedding gift from Queen Margrethe.

When Alexandra married Joachim, she gave up her career in marketing. It is believed that she had renounced her British citizenship prior to become a Danish citizen upon her marriage.

During their 9-year marriage, Joachim and Alexandra welcomed two sons. On 28 August 1999, Count Nikolai, the first grandchild of the Queen and Prince Consort, was born. His younger brother, Count Felix, followed three years later on 22 July 2002.

==Life as a princess==
Alexandra became popular with the Danish people. Known for her fashion sense and charity work, she was dubbed the Diana of the North. She is a native English and German speaker (through her father and mother, respectively), and her fluency in German helped her pick up the Danish language quickly. Within a few months, she spoke it nearly without an accent, which further endeared her to the Danes. As she said in an interview, &quot;I don&#x27;t find the grammar especially difficult, but the pronunciation can be hard, since we swallow some of our words. It reminds me a little of Chinese, with the glottal stop … Saying something with an upswing or a downswing can give a word an entirely different meaning,&quot; she explained. &quot;It was my decision to learn the language immediately. It would have been terrible to have to stand up and speak English at an engagement, or thank someone for something. It would have been utterly wrong. This is my home, and so there was no other option&quot;.

Both during and after her marriage, she was involved in numerous philanthropic pursuits, including the Youth Red Cross, the Danish Society for the Blind, UNICEF, and single mothers&#x27; advocacy group, Mother Help. She also served as a UNICEF ambassador when she travelled to Thailand to visit HIV/AIDS patients.

==End of marriage==
On 16 September 2004, Alexandra and Joachim announced their separation and eventual intention to divorce. It would be the first in the Royal Family since 1846. The Folketing decided to put Alexandra on the civil list for life, independent of her possible future remarriage. Alexandra&#x27;s payments of her new yearly allowance of 2.1m kroner (US$330,000) started retroactively from 1 October 2004. The couple divorced on 8 April 2005.

On 23 June 2017, she announced that she would renounce her entitlement to the Danish civil list in July 2020, coinciding with the 18th birthday of Prince Felix.

==Second marriage and current life==
As early as mid-2005, there were reports and pictures of Alexandra with Martin Jørgensen, the son of Jacob Jørgensen, a well-known film producer whose company, JJ Film, has produced – and continues to produce – numerous documentaries in which the Danish royal family has participated.

Alexandra married Martin Jørgensen on 3 March 2007 in a private ceremony at Øster Egede Church near Fakse. She was walked down the aisle by her sons, Nikolai (aged nearly 7) and Felix (aged nearly 5). Aside from the young princes, no one from the Danish royal family attended the ceremony. As a result of her remarriage Alexandra lost her title as a Princess of Denmark and ceased to be a member of the Danish Royal Family. In September 2015, it was announced that Jørgensen and the Countess were divorcing after eight and a half years of marriage. The Countess had cited differences in values as the reason for the divorce. The divorce was finalised in 2015.

In 2007, the Countess of Frederiksborg joined the Danish board of directors of Ferring Pharmaceuticals. In 2017, it was announced that she would take up the position of Poling Chair of Business and Government at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business.

Alexandra still occasionally attends events with her former husband and the rest of the Danish royal family. Among other events, in 2012, she attended a gala performance at Koncerthuset in honour of Queen Margrethe II&#x27;s 40th jubilee, and in 2018, she attended the gala dinner for her former brother-in-law Crown Prince Frederik&#x27;s 50th birthday at Christiansborg Palace.

<doc id="599432" wikidata="Q1543519" url="?curid=599432" title="Halligan bar">
<text>A Halligan bar (also known as a Halligan tool or Hooligan tool) is a forcible entry tool used by firefighters.

==History==
The Halligan bar was designed by New York City Fire Department (FDNY) First Deputy Chief Hugh Halligan in 1948 and was named after him. 

&quot;Created by Hugh Halligan, allegedly modeled on a burglar&#x27;s tool found in the rubble of a bank fire during overhaul operations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nycfiremuseum/6496&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; — New York City Fire Museum

That same year, blacksmith Peter Clarke made the first prototype of the tool. 

&quot;Due to a dispute between the Department and Halligan, the tool was not purchased by the FDNY until the patent expired and the Department was able to buy comparable tools from other vendors. Nonetheless it was widely used; firefighters purchased their own &quot;Halligans&quot; out-of-pocket, a tribute to its effectiveness and dependability. The FDNY now issues a modified Halligan Tool called the &quot;PRO-BAR,&quot; manufactured by Fire Hooks Unlimited, for use as the primary forcible entry tool.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nycfiremuseum/6495&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; — New York City Fire Museum

Despite its popularity among FDNY ladder companies, the department initially refrained from purchasing the tool to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. However, the Boston Fire Department was the first major customer of the Halligan bar, purchasing one for every fire company in the city. This led to widespread adoption of the tool, first in North America and eventually worldwide. The Halligan bar has become the most versatile hand tool for fireground tasks over the past seven decades.

==Design==
Based on the earlier Kelly tool, the Halligan is a multipurpose tool for prying, twisting, punching, or striking. It consists of a claw (or fork), a blade (wedge or adze), and a tapered pick, which is especially useful in quickly breaching many types of locked doors.

One variant of the Halligan has a heavy sliding collar on the shaft. Once the prying end of the tool is wedged into position, the sliding &quot;hammer&quot; is used to force the wedge, allowing for proper seating before prying. The adze end is also assisted by using the sliding hammer to generate forced traction on a hooked cylinder. Another variant has an end that resembles a lever-type can opener, used for making large holes for access or ventilation in sheet metal.

The Halligan is available in a number of lengths – typically  – and of various materials, including titanium, beryllium copper or stainless steel. Carrying straps or rings can be found. The 18-inch Halligan is often referred to as an officer&#x27;s tool.
A Halligan bar and a flathead axe can be joined (and partially interlocked, head-to-toe) to form what is known as a &quot;married set&quot;, &quot;set of irons&quot; or simply &quot;the irons&quot;. This combination of tools is most common within the fire service. However, the Halligan may also be combined with a Halligan hook or sledgehammer as an alternative.

== Uses ==
* Doors and locks
** Either the adze end or fork end of the tool can be used to break through the latch of a swinging door by forcing the tool between the door and door jamb and prying the two apart, striking it with a sledgehammer or a flat-head axe.
** The firefighter holding the Halligan can use a &quot;baseball bat swing&quot; to sink the pick into the door frame near the door handle and then force the door by applying pressure to the adze.
** Another option is to use the Halligan to pry the door off the top hinges. The pick and adze (only when properly used) provide protection to the arms, hands, and body of the holder during forcible entry operation.
** The pick can be placed into the shackle (or eye) of a padlock or hasp and twisted or pried to break it free.
** Using a K-tool and the adze end, a lock cylinder can easily be pulled.
* Vehicles
** The Halligan can be used to make a purchase point on a car hood to cut the battery.
** The Halligan can also be used for vehicle extrication, among other things.
** The tool can be used to pry open the hood of a car when it is jammed from an accident.
* The Halligan can be used to knock down a wall in a house to get to another area.
* The point can be used to break glass on a car or building for access or ventilation.
* It can also be driven into a roof to provide a foothold for firefighters engaged in vertical ventilation.
* The fork end is routinely used to shut off gas meter valves.
* The Halligan can be used as a step to get up on a window that is at head level.
* The Halligan can be tied to a rope and act as an anchor in the window frame, for improvised bailout.

<doc id="599435" wikidata="Q815102" url="?curid=599435" title="Siege of Sidney Street">
<text>The siege of Sidney Street of January 1911, also known as the Battle of Stepney, was a gunfight in the East End of London between a combined police and army force and two Latvian revolutionaries. The siege was the culmination of a series of events that began in December 1910, with an attempted jewellery robbery at Houndsditch in the City of London by a gang of Latvian immigrants which resulted in the murder of three policemen, the wounding of two others, and the death of George Gardstein, a key member of the Latvian gang.

An investigation by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein&#x27;s accomplices, most of whom were arrested within two weeks. The police were informed that the last two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney. The police evacuated local residents, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted for about six hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire spread. While the London Fire Brigade were damping down the ruins—in which they found the two bodies—the building collapsed, killing a fireman.

The siege marked the first time the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed stand-off. It was also the first siege in Britain to be caught on camera, as the events were filmed by Pathé News. Some of the footage included images of the Home Secretary, Winston Churchill. His presence caused a political row over the level of his operational involvement. At the trial in May 1911 of those arrested for the Houndsditch jewellery robbery, all but one of the accused were acquitted; the conviction was overturned on appeal. The events were fictionalised in film—in &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Siege of Sidney Street&quot; (1960)—and novels. On the centenary of the events two tower blocks in Sidney Street were named after Peter the Painter, one of the minor members of the gang who was probably not present at either Houndsditch or Sidney Street. The murdered policemen and the fireman who died are commemorated with memorial plaques.

==Background==

===Immigration and demographics in London===
In the 19th century, the Russian Empire was home to about five million Jews, the largest Jewish community at the time. Subjected to religious persecution and violent pogroms, many emigrated and between 1875 and 1914 around 120,000 arrived in the United Kingdom, mostly in England. The influx reached its peak in the late 1890s when large numbers of Jewish immigrants—mostly poor and semi-skilled or unskilled—settled in the East End of London. The concentration of Jewish immigrants into some areas was almost 100 per cent of the population, and a study undertaken in 1900 showed that Houndsditch and Whitechapel were both identified as a &quot;well-defined intensely Jewish district&quot;.

Some of the expatriates were revolutionaries, many of whom were unable to adapt to life in the politically less oppressive London. The social historian William J. Fishman writes that &quot;the &quot;&quot; (crazy) Anarchists were almost accepted as part of the East End landscape&quot;; the terms &quot;socialist&quot; and &quot;anarchist&quot; had been conflated in the British press, who used the terms interchangeably to refer to those with revolutionary beliefs. A leading article in &quot;The Times&quot; described the Whitechapel area as one that &quot;harbours some of the worst alien anarchists and criminals who seek our too hospitable shore. And these are the men who use the pistol and the knife.&quot;

From the turn of the century, gang warfare persisted in the Whitechapel and Aldgate areas of London between groups of Bessarabians and refugees from Odessa; various revolutionary factions were active in the area. The Tottenham Outrage of January 1909, by two revolutionary Russians in London—Paul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus—was an attempt to rob a payroll van, which left two dead and twenty injured. The event used a tactic often employed by revolutionary groups in Russia: the expropriation or theft of private property to fund radical activities.

The influx of émigrés and the increase of violent crime associated with it, led to popular concerns and comments in the press. The government passed the Aliens Act 1905 in an attempt to reduce immigration. The popular press reflected the opinions of many at the time; a leading article in &quot;The Manchester Evening Chronicle&quot; supported the bill to bar &quot;the dirty, destitute, diseased, verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil&quot;. The journalist Robert Winder, in his examination of migration into Britain, opines that the Act &quot;gave official sanction to xenophobic reflexes which might ... have remained dormant&quot;.

===Latvian émigré gang===
By 1910 Russian émigrés met regularly at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many of its members were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora, most of whom were Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Most members of the group were revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their involvement in the unsuccessful 1905 revolution in Latvia and its violent suppression. All had left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.

A leading figure in the group was George Gardstein, whose real name was probably Hartmanis; he also used the aliases Garstin, Poloski, Poolka, Morountzeff, Mourimitz, Maurivitz, Milowitz, Morintz, Morin and Levi. Gardstein, who probably was an anarchist, had been accused of murder and acts of terrorism in Warsaw in 1905 before his arrival in London. Another member of the group, Jacob (or Yakov) Peters, had been an agitator in Russia while in the army and later as a dockyard worker. He had served a term in prison for his activities and had been tortured by the removal of his fingernails. Yourka Dubof was another Russian agitator who had fled to England after being flogged by Cossacks. Fritz Svaars () was a Latvian who had been arrested by the Russian authorities three times for terrorist offences, but escaped each time. He had travelled through the United States, where he undertook a series of robberies, before arriving in London in June 1910.

Another member was &quot;Peter the Painter&quot;, a nickname for a man also known as Peter Piaktow (or Piatkov, Pjatkov or Piaktoff); his real name was Janis Zaklis. The police suggested he was the ringleader of the gang, although there is no evidence that he was present at Houndsditch or Sidney Street. William (or Joseph) Sokoloff (or Sokolow) was a Latvian who had lived in Latvia and had been arrested in Riga in 1905 for murder and robbery before travelling to London. Another of the group&#x27;s members was Karl Hoffman—whose real name was Alfred Dzircol—who had been involved in revolutionary and criminal activities for several years, including gun-running. In London he had worked as a decorator. John Rosen—real name John Zelin or Tzelin—came to London in 1909 from Riga and worked as a barber, while another member of the gang was Max Smoller, also known as Joe Levi and &quot;Josepf the Jew&quot;. He was wanted in his native Crimea for several jewel robberies. Three women members of the gang, or associates of members of the gang, were among those who faced charges arising from the Houndsditch robbery attempt: Nina Vassileva—who was convicted of a minor offence but was cleared on appeal—Luba Milstein and Rosa Trassjonsky.

===Policing in the capital===
Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, the capital was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway over most of the capital, and the City of London Police, who were responsible for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the purview of the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill.

While on the beat, or in the course of their normal duties, the officers of the City of London and Metropolitan forces were provided with a short wooden truncheon for protection. When they faced armed opponents—as was the case in Sidney Street—the police were issued with Webley and Bull Dog revolvers, shotguns and small-bore rifles fitted with .22 Morris-tube barrels, the last of which were more commonly used on small indoor shooting galleries.

==Houndsditch murders, December 1910==

At the beginning of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller&#x27;s shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller&#x27;s was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris&#x27;s son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills. Some of this equipment had been obtained from the Italian anarchist exile Errico Malatesta, who had a workshop in Islington; he was not aware it was for use in a robbery.

With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. It is likely that as well as Gardstein, Fritz Svaars and William Sokoloff—the two gunmen who died in the Sidney Street siege—were present, along with Max Smoller and Nina Vassileva. Bernard Porter, writing in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, considers that Peter the Painter was not at the property that night. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, takes a different view. He considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman&#x27;s lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events—either as lookouts or in unknown capacities—were Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva.

On 16 December, working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began to break through the back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, returning to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour&#x27;s property. Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises. Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch, where he could hear the noise, which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further. At 11:00 he knocked at the door of 11 Exchange Buildings—the only property with a light on in the back. The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately. So as not to rouse the man&#x27;s concerns, Piper asked him &quot;is the missus in?&quot; The man answered in broken English that she was out, and the policeman said he would return later.
Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Walter Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Robert Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.

As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein&#x27;s assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape who was able to provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group went to Svaars&#x27; and Peter the Painter&#x27;s lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Golding Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang&#x27;s associates, Milstein and Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man was the one who had killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.

Other policemen arrived in Houndsditch, and began to attend to the wounded. Tucker&#x27;s body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the London Hospital (now the Royal London Hospital) in Whitechapel Road. Choate was also taken there, where he was operated on, but he died at 5:30am on 17 December. Bentley was taken to St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital. He was half-conscious on arrival, but recovered enough to be able to have a conversation with his pregnant wife and answer questions about the events. At 6:45pm on 17 December his condition worsened, and he died at 7:30. The killings of Tucker, Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders of police officers carried out in Britain in peacetime.

==Investigation, 17 December 1910 – 2 January 1911==
The City of London police informed the Metropolitan force, as their protocol demanded, and both services issued revolvers to the detectives involved in the search. The subsequent investigation was challenging for the police because of the cultural differences between the British police and the largely foreign residents of the area covered by the search. The police did not have any Russian, Latvian or Yiddish speakers on the force.

In the early hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became increasingly concerned as Gardstein&#x27;s condition worsened, and they sent for a local doctor, explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend. The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest—it was later found to be touching the right ventricle of the heart. The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital, but he refused; with no other course open to him, the doctor sold them pain medication and left. The Russian was dead by 9:00 that morning. The doctor returned at 11:00am and found the body. He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the night before, and so reported the death to the coroner, not the police. At midday the coroner reported the death to the local police who, led by Divisional Detective Inspector Frederick Wensley, went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse. Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered, and she was soon found by the police, hastily burning papers; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at Old Jewry. Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End, particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area. Wensley, who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area, subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation.

Gardstein&#x27;s body was removed to a local mortuary where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions of those who had helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassileva, after she had told him she had been one of the people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group&#x27;s associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.
On 22 December a public memorial service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. King George V was represented by Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul&#x27;s environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for half an hour to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13 km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.

Identity parades were held at Bishopsgate police station on 23 December. Isaac Levy, who had seen the group leaving Exchange Buildings, identified Peters and Dubof as the two he had seen carrying Gardstein. It was also ascertained that Federoff had been witnessed at the events. The following day Federoff, Peters and Dubof all appeared at the Guildhall police court where they were charged with being connected to the murder of the three policemen, and with conspiracy to burgle the jewellery shop. All three pleaded not guilty.

On 27 December the poster bearing Gardstein&#x27;s picture was seen by his landlord, who alerted police. Wensley and his colleagues visited the lodgings on Gold Street, Stepney and found knives, a gun, ammunition, false passports and revolutionary publications. Two days later there was another hearing at the Guildhall police court. In addition to Federoff, Peters and Dubof, present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky. With some of the defendants having a low standard of English, interpreters were used throughout the proceedings. At the end of the day the case was adjourned until 6 January 1911.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 1911 the body of Léon Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches long, were on his cheeks. The case became connected in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at the time for the link was scant. The historian F G Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because he was one of the informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists. The police believed that the Clapham Common murder was not connected to the Houndsditch police murders.

The posters of Gardstein proved effective, and late on New Year&#x27;s Day a member of the public came forward to provide information about Svaars and Sokoloff. The informant told police that the men were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, along with a lodger, Betty Gershon, who was Sokoloff&#x27;s mistress. The informant was persuaded to visit the property the following day to confirm the two men were still present. A meeting took place on the afternoon of 2 January to decide the next steps. Wensley, high-ranking members of the Metropolitan force and Sir William Nott-Bower, the Commissioner of the City Police, were present.

==Events of 3 January==

Just after midnight on 3 January, 200 police officers from the City of London and Metropolitan forces cordoned off the area around 100 Sidney Street. Armed officers were placed at number 111, directly opposite number 100, and throughout the night the residents of the houses on the block were roused and evacuated. Wensley woke the ground floor tenants at number 100 and asked them to fetch Gershon, claiming that she was needed by her sick husband. When Gershon appeared she was grabbed by the police and taken to the City of London police headquarters; the ground floor lodgers also evacuated. Number 100 was now empty of all residents, apart from Svaars and Sokoloff, neither of whom seemed to be aware of the evacuation.

The police&#x27;s operating procedure—and the law which governed their actions—meant they were unable to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest; he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff.

By 9:00am it was apparent that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It was the first time that the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.
Churchill arrived on the scene at 11:50am to observe the incident at first hand; he later reported that he thought the crowd were unwelcoming to him, as he heard people asking &quot;Oo let &#x27;em in?&quot;, in reference to the Liberal Party&#x27;s immigration policy that had allowed the influx from Russia. Churchill&#x27;s role during the siege is unclear. His biographers, Paul Addison and Roy Jenkins, both consider that he gave no operational commands to the police, but a Metropolitan police history of the event states that the events of Sidney Street were &quot;a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions&quot;. In a subsequent letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, Churchill clarified his role while he was present:

I did not interfere in any way with the dispositions made by the police authorities on the spot. I never overruled those authorities nor overrode them. From beginning to end the police had an absolutely free hand. ... I did not send for the Artillery or the Engineers. I was not consulted as to whether they should be sent for.

Shooting between the two sides reached a peak between 12:00 and 12:30pm, but at 12:50 smoke was seen coming from the building&#x27;s chimneys and from the second floor windows; it has not been established how the fire was started, whether by accident or design. The fire slowly spread, and by 1:30 it had taken a firm hold and had spread to the other floors. A second detachment of Scots Guards arrived, bringing with them a Maxim machine gun, which was never used. Horse-drawn artillery field guns were also brought from St John&#x27;s Wood barracks, but again not used. Shortly afterwards Sokoloff put his head out of the window; he was shot by one of the soldiers and he fell back inside. The senior officer of the London Fire Brigade present on the scene sought permission to extinguish the blaze, but was refused. He approached Churchill in order to have the decision overturned, but the Home Secretary approved the police decision. Churchill later wrote:
I now intervened to settle this dispute, at one moment quite heated. I told the fire-brigade officer on my authority as Home Secretary that the house was to be allowed to burn down and that he was to stand by in readiness to prevent the conflagration from spreading.

By 2:30pm the shooting from the house had ceased. One of the detectives present walked close to the wall and pushed the door open, before retreating. Other police officers, and some of the soldiers, came out and waited for the men to exit. None did, and as part of the roof collapsed, it was clear to onlookers that the men were both dead; the fire brigade was allowed to start extinguishing the fire. At 2:40 Churchill left the scene, at about the time the Royal Horse Artillery arrived with two 13-pounder field artillery pieces. Sokoloff&#x27;s body was found soon after the firemen entered. A wall collapsed on a group of five firemen, who were all taken to the London Hospital. One of the men, Superintendent Charles Pearson, had a fractured spine; he died six months later. After shoring up the building, the firemen resumed their search; at around 6:30pm the second body—that of Svaars—was found.

==Aftermath==

The siege was captured by Pathé News cameras—one of their earliest stories and the first siege to be captured on film—and it included footage of Churchill. When the newsreels were screened in cinemas, Churchill was booed with shouts of &quot;shoot him&quot; from audiences. His presence was controversial to many and the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Balfour, remarked, &quot;He [Churchill] was, I understand, in military phrase, in what is known as the zone of fire—he and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing, but what was the right hon. Gentleman doing? That I neither understood at the time, nor do I understand now.&quot; Jenkins suggests that he went simply because &quot;he could not resist going to see the fun himself&quot;.

An inquest was held in January into the deaths at Houndsditch and Sidney Street. The jury took fifteen minutes to reach the conclusion that the two bodies located were those of Svaars and Sokoloff, that Tucker, Bentley and Choate had been murdered by Gardstein and others during the burglary attempt. Rosen was arrested on 2 February at work in Well Street, Hackney, and Hoffman was taken into custody on 15 February. The committal proceedings spread from December 1910—with Milstein and Trassjonsky appearing—to March 1911, and included Hoffman from 15 February. The proceedings consisted of 24 individual hearings. In February Milstein was discharged on the basis that there was insufficient evidence against her; Hoffman, Trassjonsky and Federoff were released in March on the same basis.

The case against the four remaining arrested gang members was heard at the Old Bailey by Mr Justice Grantham in May. Dubof and Peters were accused of Tucker&#x27;s murder, Dubof, Peters, Rosen and Vassilleva were charged with &quot;feloniously harbouring a felon guilty of murder&quot; and for &quot;conspiring and agreeing together and with others unknown to break and enter the shop of Henry Samuel Harris with intent to steal his goods&quot;. The case lasted for eleven days; there were problems with the proceedings because of the language difficulties and the chaotic personal lives of the accused. The case resulted in acquittals for all except Vassileva, who was convicted of conspiracy in the burglary and sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment; her conviction was overturned on appeal.

After the high levels of criticism aimed at the Aliens Act, Churchill decided to strengthen the legislation, and proposed the Aliens (Prevention of Crime) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule. The MP Josiah C Wedgwood objected, and wrote to Churchill to ask him not to introduce the hard-line measures &quot;You know as well as I do that human life does not matter a rap in comparison with the death of ideas and the betrayal of English traditions.&quot; The bill did not become law.

==Legacy==

Bryant and Woodhams were presented with the King&#x27;s Police Medal for their bravery; Woodhams was still badly injured and had to be carried to the king on a stretcher for the presentation. Both Bryant and Woodhams were also promoted; as they were being invalided out of the force, the promotions ensured they were paid a higher pension. The Lord Mayor of London presented the King&#x27;s Police Medal to the families of the three murdered policemen. For each child of the murdered policemen, the City of London Corporation gave five shillings a week until they reached the age of fifteen.

The inadequacy of the police&#x27;s firepower led to criticism in the press, and on 12 January 1911 several alternative weapons were tested. The trials resulted in the Metropolitan Police replacing the Webley revolver with the Webley &amp; Scott .32 calibre MP semi-automatic pistol later that year; the City of London Police adopted the weapon in 1912.

The members of the group dispersed after the events. Peter the Painter was never seen or heard from again. It was assumed he left the country, and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards; none were confirmed. Jacob Peters returned to Russia, rose to be deputy head of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, and was executed in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s 1938 purge. Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum, where she died in 1971. Dubof and Federoff disappeared from the records; Vassilleva remained in the East End for the remainder of her life and died at Brick Lane in 1963. Hoffman moved to New York where he lived for many years with Luba Milstein, who had given birth to Fritz Svaars child. Smoller left the country in 1911 and travelled to Paris, after which he disappeared; Milstein later emigrated to the United States.

The siege was the inspiration for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s original 1934 version of &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;; the story was heavily fictionalised in the 1960 film &quot;The Siege of Sidney Street&quot;. The novelist Georges Simenon drew on the story for his 1930 Maigret detective novel &quot;Pietr-le-Letton&quot; (&quot;Pietr the Latvian&quot;). The siege was also the inspiration for two other novels, &quot;The Siege of Sidney Street&quot; (1960) by F Oughton and &quot;A Death Out of Season&quot; (1973) by Emanuel Litvinoff.

In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two tower blocks in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House; Peter the Painter was only involved in a minor capacity in the events and was not present at the siege. The name plaques on the buildings call Peter the Painter an &quot;anti-hero&quot;; the decision angered the Metropolitan Police Federation. A council spokesman said that &quot;There is no evidence that Peter the Painter killed the three policemen, so we knew we were not naming the block after a murderer. ... but he is the name that East Enders associate with the siege and Sidney Street.&quot; In December 2010, on the centenary of the events at Houndsditch, a memorial plaque for the three murdered policemen was unveiled near the location. Three weeks later, on the anniversary of the siege, a plaque was unveiled in honour of Pearson, the fireman who died because the building collapsed on him.

<text>John Heminges (bapt. 25 November 1566 – 10 October 1630) was an actor in the King&#x27;s Men, the playing company for which William Shakespeare wrote. Along with Henry Condell, he was an editor of the First Folio, the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623. He was also the financial manager for the King&#x27;s Men.

==Life==
Heminges was baptised at St Peter de Witton Church, Droitwich, Worcestershire, on 25 November 1566. Sent to London at the age of twelve, he was apprenticed for nine years to the City Grocer John Collins, becoming a freeman of the Grocers&#x27; Company on 24 April 1587. On 10 March 1588 he received a licence to marry Rebecca Knell (née Edwards), the widow of William Knell, an actor with the Queen&#x27;s Men who had been killed at Thame, Oxfordshire, in 1587 by John Towne, a fellow actor. Heminges and his sixteen-year-old wife settled in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, and had at least thirteen children there between the years 1590 and 1613.

Heminges&#x27;s association with the theatre had begun by 1593, when he and Augustine Phillips were with Lord Strange&#x27;s Men. By the next year he and Phillips had joined the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men, later the King&#x27;s Men. Heminges remained with the Company until his death. Privy Council records from 1630 state that he received £100 to relieve the Company during a period of plague.

In August 1604, Augustine Phillips and Heminges and their King&#x27;s Men fellows served at Somerset House as grooms in the household of the Spanish ambassador Juan Fernández de Velasco y Tovar, 5th Duke of Frías. The actors, possibly including William Shakespeare, may have employed simply as extra hired help in magnificent households appointed for the ambassadors, and were not necessarily the recipients of special royal favour.

Heminges remained active in the Grocers&#x27; Company alongside his theatrical activities; indeed, the two sometimes intertwined. On 13 December 1608 he was admitted as one of the ten seacoal-meters for the city of London, citizens appointed to measure the coal imported into the city by sea. Shortly afterwards he took on John Jackson as his deputy. Both Heminges and Jackson later acted as trustees for William Shakespeare when he purchased the Blackfriars Gatehouse in 1613. Between 1595 and 1628 Heminges took on ten apprentices with the Grocers&#x27; Company. Of these ten, eight appear to have performed for Heminges&#x27;s company, in both boys&#x27; and adult roles. Alexander Cooke was one of his apprentices. Heminges also built and operated a taphouse at the Globe.

Heminges was mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s will, along with Richard Burbage and Henry Condell, each being bequeathed 26 shillings and eightpence to buy mourning rings. Burbage died before the publication of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;First Folio&quot;, but Heminges and Condell became credited contributors of the book. They mentioned in their preface, &quot;To the great Variety of Readers&quot;, that they wished &quot;the Author himselfe had liv&#x27;d to have set forth, and overseen his owne writings&quot;, they also mention their own care and pain &quot;to haue collected &amp; publish’d&quot; the works. Their editorial efforts were vital to preserving a number of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, some of which might have been lost otherwise.

As a sharer in the Globe Theatre, Heminges’ name, along with the other sharers, is mentioned several times in various legal documents that were discovered by American researcher Charles William Wallace. The Globe was plagued by lawsuits as the shares were left to beneficiaries who did not have the continued welfare of the company at heart. In one such lawsuit, &quot;Heminges v Ostler&quot;, Heminges was sued by his daughter, Thomasina Ostler over a share of the company. The surviving records do not specify the final outcome of the suit. At his death, Heminges’ shares in the Globe and Blackfriars theatres passed to his son, William Heminges. The lawsuit records are valuable to historians for the detailed information they contain regarding the company business.

Heminges died in October 1630 in Southwark, and was buried 12 October 1630 at the parish church of St Mary Aldermanbury. In his will he had asked to be buried as close to his wife as possible.

==Work==
The extent and nature of Heminges&#x27; acting is not entirely clear. He is known to have performed in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Sejanus&quot; and &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; (in both cases, alongside Shakespeare). A Jacobean inscription in the 1616 Jonson folio lists him playing the role of Corbaccio in &quot;Volpone&quot;; since the same list includes Nathan Field, who did not join the King&#x27;s Men until 1616, it seems that Heminges continued to act, at least intermittently, into his fifties. Edmond Malone reported seeing Heminges&#x27; name associated with the role of Falstaff; there is, however, no other evidence of this connection. There is little more evidence to substantiate the claim later made by an actor to Alexander Pope that Heminges was a tragedian. Of his activities as manager more is known. Court documents relating to the King&#x27;s Men generally list Heminges as the recipient of money due the company; the records of Henry Herbert indicate that Heminges at least sometimes served as the point of contact between the company and the Master of the Revels. He appears to have owned a structure abutting the Globe Theatre, which may have been used as an alehouse. He served as trustee for Shakespeare when the latter purchased a house in Blackfriars in 1613.

<text>Henry Condell (bapt. 5 September 1576 – December 1627) was a British actor in the King&#x27;s Men, the playing company for which William Shakespeare wrote. With John Heminges, he was instrumental in preparing and editing the First Folio, the collected plays of Shakespeare, published in 1623.

==Life and career==
Condell&#x27;s early life is obscure. It appears that he may have been from East Anglia, as his will mentions &#x27;my Cosen Gilder late of newe Buckenham’. According to Edmond:

The only Henry Condell so far discovered at a suitable date in that part of England was the son of a Robert Condell of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, a fishmonger, and his wife, Joan, née Yeomans, of New Buckenham, a market town not far from Norwich. Henry Condell, presumably their son, was baptized at St Peter on 5 September 1576.

Traditionally, he is associated with the &quot;Harry&quot; who appears in the cast list for Richard Tarlton&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, but this identification is little more than conjecture. If the connection is true, then Condell was an actor as early as 1590, acting in Lord Strange&#x27;s Men alongside John Heminges and Augustine Phillips. Condell was definitely in London by 24 October 1596, when he married, at St Laurence Pountney, Elizabeth Smart (d.1635), the only child of John Smart of the Strand, gentleman. They settled in St Mary Aldermanbury, the parish in which Heminges lived. Condell, like Heminges, served as churchwarden in that church. Nine children were baptized there, born between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (baptized 26 October 1606), who married Herbert Finch; Henry (baptized 6 May 1610, died 1630); and William (baptized 26 May 1611).

Details of Condell&#x27;s mature life, as is usual for Renaissance actors, are few. His status within the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s and King&#x27;s companies appears to have been high; in official communications he is generally listed shortly after Burbage and Heminges. Actors&#x27; wills indicate that he was close to at least some of his colleagues in the company. Shakespeare and Phillips bequeathed him money for mourning rings; Nicholas Tooley and Alexander Cooke named him as trustee for their estates. Condell prospered enough in his profession to purchase a country home at Fulham in Middlesex and other property, including an estate called Brockhampton in Snowshill, Gloucestershire. The indentures recording the latter purchase contain the only known example of Condell&#x27;s signature or handwriting apart from his last will.

In addition to &quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot; (1598) and &quot;Every Man Out of His Humour&quot; (1599), Condell is known to have performed in four more of Jonson&#x27;s plays: &quot;Sejanus&quot; (1603), &quot;Volpone&quot; (1605), &quot;The Alchemist&quot; (1610), and &quot;&quot; (1611). He was the original Cardinal in John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; (c. 1613). And he was listed in eight of the cast lists that were added to the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679:

* &quot;Bonduca&quot;
* &quot;The Captain&quot;
* &quot;The Humorous Lieutenant&quot;
* &quot;The Knight of Malta&quot;

* &quot;The Loyal Subject&quot;
* &quot;The Mad Lover&quot;
* &quot;The Queen of Corinth&quot;
* &quot;Valentinian&quot;

Condell appears to have ended his stage career around 1619. He signed each of the nine sheets of his last will and testament on 13 December 1627. He died at Fulham aged 51, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 29 December 1627. His widow, Elizabeth, was buried there on 3 October 1635.

Condell left an extensive estate, including shares in the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres.

==Fictional portrayals==
In the 2016 sitcom &quot;Upstart Crow&quot;, Henry Condell is played by Dominic Coleman. In the 2011 film &quot;Anonymous&quot; he is played by Mark Rylance.

<text>Peter the Painter (), also known as Peter Piaktow (or Piatkov, Pjatkov, Piaktoff; ), was a member of a gang of immigrant Latvian anarchists in London in the early 20th century. After supposedly fighting in and escaping the Sidney Street Siege in 1911, he became an anti-hero in London&#x27;s East End. He was never caught, and there is some question as to whether he had participated in the Sidney Street incident, or even whether he existed at all.

==Biography==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries London became a destination for many eastern European immigrants, who settled mostly in the East End. Ethnic groups joined together in gangs, and numerous immigrants continued radical political activities. They often stole in order to fund their politics. In the wake of the Houndsditch Murders in London on 16 December 1910, a member of the gang involved was found dead at a flat at which Peter Piatkow had lived with Fritz Svaars. Both of the latter men were believed to be members of a Latvian radical group. Svaars was the cousin of Jacob Peters, another Latvian far-leftist. In January 1911 the police were informed that Svaars and an accomplice were hiding out at 100 Sidney Street. They surrounded the area and laid siege to the building in order to flush out the radicals.

Another member was &quot;Peter the Painter&quot;, a nickname for an unknown figure, possibly named Peter Piaktow (or Piatkov, Pjatkov or Piaktoff), He used several aliases, including Schtern, Straume, Makharov and Dudkin or Janis Zhaklis. Bernard Porter, writing in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, states that no firm details are known of the anarchist&#x27;s background and that &quot;None of the ... biographical &#x27;facts&#x27; about him ... is altogether reliable.&quot;

In 1988, based on research in the KGB archives, Philip Ruff, a historian of anarchism, suggested Peter the Painter might be Ģederts Eliass. He was a Latvian artist involved in the 1905 Revolution in Russia and was living in exile in England during the time of the Sidney Street Siege. He returned to Riga after the Bolshevik 1917 Revolution. More recently, Ruff has identified Peter the Painter as Jānis Žāklis (also spelled Janis Zhaklis or Zhakles), another Latvian far-leftist. Like Peters, Zhaklis was a member of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party in 1905; among his exploits was effecting the escape of Fritz Svaars from prison in Riga. Zhaklis associated with Eliass in exile in Finland, where they were involved together in the robbery of the Russian State Bank branch in Helsinki. Zhaklis broke with the Social Democrats and became an anarchist. It is unclear what happened to him after 1911. In August 2012 Ruff published a book on the life of Janis Zhaklis; it was released by Dienas Grāmata (in Latvian) as &quot;Pa stāvu liesmu debesīs: Nenotveramā latviešu anarhista Pētera Māldera laiks un dzīve&quot; (&quot;A Towering Flame: The Life &amp; Times of Peter the Painter&quot;). This has been succeeded by an English-language edition, published by Breviary Stuff in 2019.

==Legacy and honours==
*The type of gun which Peter the Painter allegedly used at Sidney Street, a German Mauser C96 pistol, was sometimes called a &quot;Peter the Painter&quot; after him, particularly in Ireland during the War of Independence and later. There is currently a &#x27;Peter the Painter&#x27; Mauser C96 on display in the James Connolly Museum in Belfast, which was used by the IRA in 1919-1921 and named after Peters.
*In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two tower blocks in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House, even though Peter the Painter was only involved in a minor capacity in the events, and was not present at the siege. A local councillor and the Metropolitan Police Federation protested against this, saying that the killer should not be recognised.
*&quot;Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries&quot;, a series about a female detective from the past in Australia, has an episode (s1 e4) which includes Peter the Painter as a major figure.

<doc id="599449" wikidata="Q23925148" url="?curid=599449" title="Serbian diaspora">
<text>Serbian diaspora refers to Serbian emigrant communities in the diaspora. The existence of a numerous diaspora of Serbian nationals is mainly a consequence of either economic or political (coercion or expulsion) reasons.

There were different waves of Serb migration, characterized by:
#Economic emigration (end of 19th–beginning of 20th c.)
#Political emigration (from 1945 up to 1967) of anti-Communist regime members, better known as the Chetnik Immigration
#Economic emigration (1967 up to the 1980s) of mostly laborers with mid-level education or professionals of higher education
#Political emigration (1990s) refugees of the Yugoslav Wars.

The main countries of destination were Germany, Austria, the United States, Sweden, Canada, and Australia. Based on a 2007 estimate, there were 4.2 to 5.8 million Serbs or people of Serbian origin in the diaspora. The Ministry of Diaspora (MoD) estimated in 2008 that the Serb diaspora numbered 3,908,000 to 4,170,000, the numbers including not only Serbian citizens but people who view Serbia as their nation-state regardless of the citizenship they hold; these could include second- and third-generation Serbian emigrants or descendants of emigrants from other former Yugoslav republics who never obtained Serbian citizenship but are ethnic Serbs. By continent or region, it was estimated that 2,705,000–2,765,000 lived in Europe (excluding former Yugoslavia), 1–1,2 million in North America, 130,000 in Australia, 26,000 in Africa, 20,000 in Central and South America, 8,000 in Asia, 5,000–7,000 in New Zealand, 5,000 in the Middle East. There were 1,000 diaspora associations, registered in 191 countries.

In 2014 it was estimated based on diplomatic-consular posts that the Serbian diaspora numbered 5.1 million in about 100 states. The term &quot;Serbs in the region&quot; is used for ethnic Serbs of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Albania, Kosovo and Hungary, estimated to number 2,120,000. The latter group may or may not be included in estimates.

==Serbian diaspora by countries==
===Europe===
====Germany====

The first Serbs who settled in Germany were Serbian craftsmen and seasonal workers, who started arriving at the beginning of the 20th century . At the end of the Second World War, the German population, as well as a part of the Serbian monarchists and Croatian nationalists, fled from Yugoslavia to Germany due to the retaliation of the communist government. More mass immigration of labor migrants, the so-called guest workers ( German: Gastarbeiter ) took place after 1968 and the signing of the employment agreement between the SFRY and FR Germany. After that, a new wave of immigration occurred due to the disintegration and wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia in the 90s of the 20th century.

Most Serbs living in Germany came here in the 1960s and 1970s as job-seeking immigrants or guest workers from Yugoslavia. Other Serbs – or Serbian citizens – came to Germany as refugees during the Yugoslavian wars (from 1991 to 2001) or as asylum seekers from the Roma community .

====Austria====

Serbs have very long historical presence on the territory of modern Austria. By the end of the Middle Ages, migration of ethnic Serbs towards Austrian lands was caused by expansion of the Ottoman Empire. Exiled members of Serbian noble families were welcomed by Habsburg rulers, who granted them new possessions. In 1479, emperor Friedrich III granted castle Weitensfeld in Carinthia to exiled members of Branković dynasty of Serbia.

During the period of Ottoman–Habsburg wars (from 16th to 18th century), Austrian policy towards Serbs was marked by special interests, related to complex political situation in various regions of the expanding Habsburg monarchy. Emperor Leopold I issued several charters (1690, 1691, 1695) to Eastern Orthodox Serbs, who sided with Habsburgs during the Vienna War (1683-1699), granting them religious freedom in the Monarchy. Serbian Orthodox patriarch Arsenije III visited Austrian capital (Vienna) on several occasions, and died there in 1706.

Serbian Orthodox metropolitan Isaija Đaković, who visited Austrian capital on several occasions since 1690, also died in Vienna, in 1708. During the 18th and 19th century, new communities of ethnic Serbs were developing in major Austrian cities, consisted mainly of merchants, officers and students, who were under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Metropolitanate of Karlovci.

The Österreichisch Serbische Gesellschaft (Austrian Serbian Society) was founded in 1936 as &quot;Österreichisch-Jugoslawischen Gesellschaft&quot;.

In 2011, the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Austria and Switzerland was created, centered in Vienna.

They are the second largest ethnic minority group in Austria, after Germans. The first wave of Serbs to Austria began in the early 19th century, while the largest wave was during the migrant worker program of the 1960s and 1970s. Serb immigration to Austria is still active today due to economic and familial factors. Like in most Western European countries, the Serb community in Austria consists mainly of Serbs from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

====Switzerland====

Swiss Serbs refers to ethnic Serbs or people of Serbian ancestry that are citizens of Switzerland. There are 185 303 people of Serbian origin living in Switzerland, making the 4th largest ethnic group. They are located mostly in the regions of Geneva, Lausanne, Basel and Zurich. 
Most Serbs moved to Switzerland during the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s, some also came as refugees during the Yugoslav wars of the 1990&#x27;s. 
The first migration of Serbs to Switzerland began in the middle of the 19th century. Before and during the First World War, some Serbs studied at the University of Zurich, including some who later held important offices in their homeland. Zurich was considered an important educational center for young Serbs. From 1863 to 1914, a total of 160 Serbian students studied in Zurich, including numerous women. This was a result of the good economic, cultural, diplomatic and political relations between Switzerland and Serbia at the time.

The second wave of Serb migration occurred after the coup d&#x27;état by Alexander I. On 6 January 1929, he suspended the 1921 constitution, dissolved parliament and proclaimed the royal dictatorship . In the interwar period, many Serbs, as well as Croats and Slovenes who were oppressed or in an economically hopeless situation, fled to the West.

In the second half of the 20th century, large numbers of Serbs went to Western Europe (especially Austria, Germany and Switzerland ), North America or Australia as guest workers, largely due to difficult economic conditions . The Serbs played a disproportionately strong role in Yugoslav guest worker migration to Switzerland. Following recruitment agreements, Switzerland concluded a corresponding agreement with Yugoslavia in 1961. In addition, there were some emigrants who left Yugoslavia for political reasons. This migration enabled the then communist Yugoslavia to reduce unemployment and at the same time generated enormous foreign currency earnings through the money the emigrants sent to their families . Initially, it was not intended that the workers would stay in Switzerland permanently. Women and children have since followed suit, and some Serbs are already in the third or fourth generation living here.

The last wave of emigration came with the collapse of Yugoslavia (1991–1995), when Serbs left the country because of the renewed ethnic conflicts, the civil war, but also because of the catastrophic economic situation.

====France====

There are about 120,000 Serbs in France today. They are located mainly in the regions of Paris, Lyon, Grenoble, Belfort, Mulhouse, Montbéliard and Strasbourg .
The first wave of Serbs in France came together with other southern Europeans ( Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Greeks ). The majority of Serbs, however, came during the 1960s and 1970s, some also came later as refugees from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s . A smaller part of Serbs in France are descendants of immigrants from the period after the First World War .

There were Serbs in Paris in the 19th century who were educated at the universities there. There were so many of them in 1886 that they founded the &quot;Serbian Reading Room&quot; in Paris. The reading room was arranged at the address: Paris, 128. Rue St. Germain, and its Board consisted of: prof. David Savić, Tihomilj Jovanović lawyer and Spiro B. Poznanović is a journalist. [2] That reading room made good progress, and it received several Serbian newspapers and magazines for free. It moved its headquarters to a new address: Paris, Rue Dolomien 3. The Serbian reading room is written about (but as a newly founded one!?) in February 1899, at the address: Salle de lecture Serbe s Rue Jean de Beauvais, Paris. [3]

Lawyer Janićije Drobnjak, professor at the Faculty of Law in Paris, died there in 1899. He is remembered for the drama in five acts &quot;The Last Despot&quot;, which was once played in the Belgrade National Theater. He also published in newspapers, such as &quot;Gimnazialac&quot; – the first work called &quot;Pustinjak&quot;. [4]

Among the Serbs in Paris is Živko Vlahović, who is engaged in translating literary works from Serbian to French and in Slavic studies. [5]

According to Delfa Ivanić, at the time of the First World War, there were 7 small Serbian taverns in Nice, where mostly Serbian people ate. Then a Serbian women&#x27;s association &quot;L komite de dam Serb&quot; was founded, whose president was Mrs. Stana Lozanić (wife of Sima Lozanić ), and Mar Marko Trifković (wife of Marko Trifković ) and Delfa Ivanić as vice presidents. The goal of the association was to help poor Serbian refugees who found themselves abroad without enough money. They sold dolls dressed in Serbian folk costumes in Nice and Lyon, and sent some to Paris and America. They also organized an exhibition of paintings by Paško Vučetić and others. Their office was in one room of the consulate. At the time, there was also a boarding school for Serbian girls in Nice. [6]

Delfa Ivanić and Stana Lozanić are in the house of Svetolik Radovanović in Paris in 1916 . founded a society with the name &quot;Committee of Serbian Women in Paris&quot;. The goal was to help Serbian refugees and send packages to prisoners. There were two presidents: Đurđina Pašić and Blanša Vesnić . Then there was also the society &quot;La Nation Serbe eu France&quot;. Some prominent Frenchmen were also members of the society: Victor Bérard, Emil Oman, Stéphane Jean-Marie Pichon ... La Patrie Serbe was a magazine of Serbs in Paris that was published from October 1916 to December 1918 in French. The editor was Dragomir Ikonić .
In the period between 1915 and in 1918 . In France, there were between five and six thousand Serbian students in more than 150 schools.

Already in May 1916, the Serbian University Battalion was formed in Josier, which included 300 high school students and students, 150 of whom had just passed the matriculation exam with excellent results.

====Sweden====

Serbs constituted a low percentage of the Swedish population prior to the 1960s. Some came after World War II, mostly seeking political asylum. The greatest proportion of Serbs came together with Greeks, Italians and Turks under the visa agreements in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within Sweden, as migrant workers (called &quot;arbetskraftsinvandring&quot;, see &quot;gastarbeiter&quot;). During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the government of Yugoslavia to help Sweden overcome its severe labour shortage.

Bosnian and Croatian Serbs migrated in another wave during and after the Yugoslav wars. A third wave, of Kosovo Serbs, came during the Kosovo war in 1999.

====Poland====
Serbs did not constitute a large community in Poland, however, their presence is attested in early modern times, when they lived in the then border town of Mohylów Podolski. According to the 1897 census, the largest Serbian populations in the Russian Partition of Poland lived in Warsaw (72), Nasielsk (46) and Będzin County (20), with very few in other locations.

According to the 1921 Polish census, main concentrations of Serbs included Lublin (29) and Warsaw (16).

In the 2011 Polish census, 844 people declared Serbian nationality.

<doc id="599451" wikidata="Q35993" url="?curid=599451" title="Lepontic language">
<text>Lepontic is an ancient Alpine Celtic language that was spoken in parts of Rhaetia and Cisalpine Gaul (now Northern Italy) between 550 and 100 BC. Lepontic is attested in inscriptions found in an area centered on Lugano, Switzerland, and including the Lake Como and Lake Maggiore areas of Italy. Being a Celtic language, its name could derive from Proto-Celtic *&quot;leikʷontio-&quot; (which also was the basis of &quot;Lepontina&quot;, which became the modern &quot;(Val) Leventina&quot;).

While some recent scholarship (e.g. Eska 1998) has tended to consider Lepontic simply as an early outlying form of Gaulish and closely akin to other, later attestations of Gaulish in Italy (Cisalpine Gaulish), some scholars (notably Lejeune 1971) continue to view it as a distinct Continental Celtic language. In this latter view, the earlier inscriptions found within a 50 km radius of Lugano are considered Lepontic, while the later ones, to the immediate south of this area, are considered Cisalpine Gaulish.

Lepontic was assimilated first by Gaulish, with the settlement of Gallic tribes north of the River Po, and then by Latin, after the Roman Republic gained control over Gallia Cisalpina during the late 2nd and 1st century BC.

==Classification==
Some scholars view (e.g. Lejeune 1971, Koch 2008) Lepontic as a distinct Continental Celtic language. Other scholars (e.g. Evans 1992, Solinas 1995, Eska 1996, McCone 1996, Matasovic 2009) consider it as an early form of Cisalpine Gaulish (or Cisalpine Celtic) and thus a dialect of Gaulish. An earlier view, prevalent for most of the 20th century and until about 1970, regarded Lepontic as a &quot;para-Celtic&quot; western Indo-European language, akin to but not part of Celtic, possibly related to Ligurian (Whatmough 1933 and Pisani 1964). However, Ligurian itself has been considered akin to, but not descended from, Common Celtic, see Kruta 1991 and Stifter 2008.

Referring to linguistic arguments as well as archaeological evidence, Schumacher even considers Lepontic a primary branch of Celtic, perhaps even the first language to diverge from Proto-Celtic. In any case, the Lepontic inscriptions are the earliest attestation of any form of Celtic, and given its very scanty attestation, it is unlikely that debates over how exactly it is to be classified within Celtic will be resolved any time soon to everyone&#x27;s satisfaction unless further significant finds come to light.

==Language==
===The alphabet===

The alphabet of Lugano, based on inscriptions found in northern Italy and Canton Ticino, was used to record Lepontic inscriptions, among the oldest testimonies of any Celtic language, in use from the 7th to the 5th centuries BC. The alphabet has 18 letters, derived from the archaic Etruscan alphabet.

The alphabet does not distinguish voiced and unvoiced occlusives, i.e. P represents /b/ or /p/, T is for /t/ or /d/, and K for /g/ or /k/. Z is probably for /ts/. U /u/ and V /w/ are distinguished. Θ is probably for /t/ and X for /g/. There are claims of a related script discovered in Glozel.

==Corpus==
Lepontic is known from around 140 inscriptions written in the alphabet of Lugano, one of five main Northern Italic alphabets derived from the Etruscan alphabet. Similar scripts were used for writing the Rhaetic and Venetic languages and the Germanic runic alphabets probably derive from a script belonging to this group.

The grouping of all inscriptions written in the alphabet of Lugano into a single language is disputed. Indeed, it was not uncommon in antiquity for a given alphabet to be used to write multiple languages. And, in fact, the alphabet of Lugano was used in the coinage of other Alpine tribes, such as the Salassi, Salluvii, and Cavares (Whatmough 1933, Lejeune 1971).

While many of the later inscriptions clearly appear to be written in Cisalpine Gaulish, some, including all of the older ones, are said to be in an indigenous language distinct from Gaulish and known as Lepontic. Until the publication of Lejeune 1971, this Lepontic language was regarded as a pre-Celtic language, possibly related to Ligurian (Whatmough 1933, Pisani 1964). Following Lejeune 1971, the consensus view became that Lepontic should be classified as a Celtic language, albeit possibly as divergent as Celtiberian, and in any case quite distinct from Cisalpine Gaulish (Lejeune 1971, Kruta 1991, Stifter 2008). Some have gone further, considering Lepontic and Cisalpine Gaulish essentially one and the same (Eska 1998). However, an analysis of the geographic distribution of the inscriptions shows that the Cisalpine Gaulish inscriptions are later and from an area to the south of the earlier (Lepontic) inscriptions, with which they display significant differences as well as similarities.

While the language is named after the tribe of the Lepontii, which occupied portions of ancient Rhaetia, specifically an Alpine area straddling modern Switzerland and Italy and bordering Cisalpine Gaul, the term is currently used by some Celticists (e.g. Eska 1998) to apply to all Celtic dialects of ancient Italy. This usage is disputed by those who continue to view the Lepontii as one of several indigenous pre-Roman tribes of the Alps, quite distinct from the Gauls who invaded the plains of Northern Italy in historical times.

The older Lepontic inscriptions date back to before the 5th century BC, the item from Castelletto Ticino being dated at the 6th century BC and that from Sesto Calende possibly being from the 7th century BC (Prosdocimi, 1991). The people who made these inscriptions are nowadays identified with the Golasecca culture, a Celtic culture in northern Italy (De Marinis 1991, Kruta 1991 and Stifter 2008). The extinction date for Lepontic is only inferred by the absence of later inscriptions.

===Funerary inscriptions===
These are the most common inscriptions in Lepontic, often including merely the name of the deceased, with or without the word &quot;pala&quot; &quot;(tomb) stone.&quot; Two of the slightly longer ones are included below.

====Carcegna vase====

::&quot;metelui maeśelalui uenia metelikna aśmina krasanikna&quot;

Probably: &quot;Uenia Metel-ikna [and] Aśmina Krasan-ikna [dedicate this vase] to Metelos Maeśelalos&quot;

====Vergiate funeral stone====

::&quot;pelkui pruiam teu karite iśos kalite palam&quot;

Probably: &quot;Iśos dedicated (? or sealed?) [this] sacred (? if &quot;teu&quot; is from *&quot;deywo-&quot;) &quot;pruiam&quot; (tomb?) [and] erected (?) [this] stone to/for &quot;Pelkos&quot;.&quot;

The apparent verbal forms &quot;karite&quot; and &quot;kalite&quot; seem to show a -t- preterite, a development also seen in Gaulish. The forms may be two distinct verbs both meaning &#x27;call (for); command, order&#x27; (Proto-Celtic *&quot;kalyo-&quot; and *&quot;galwo-&quot;) in which case the meaning is more like, &quot;Isos called for the sacred pruiam [to be dedicated] and ordered the stone [be erected].&quot; On the other hand, &quot;karite&quot; may well be cognate with Gaulish &quot;karnite&quot; &quot;erected, constructed&quot; (further cognates in Celtic include Old Irish &quot;carn&quot; &quot;tomb, heap of stones&quot; whence through Scottish Gaelic the English word &quot;cairn&quot;, and the Gaulish place name &quot;Carnuntum&quot;).

===Dedicatory inscriptions===

====Ornavasso vase====

::&quot;latumarui sapsutai-pe uinom naśom&quot;

Probably: &quot;[This] Naxian wine [is dedicated] to Latumaros and Sapsuta&quot;

This inscription is notable for containing the &quot;P-Celtic&quot; form of the Proto-Indo-European conjuctive clitic *&quot;-kwe&quot; here -&quot;pe&quot;.

====Prestino stone====
On epigraphic and archaeological grounds, this inscription is datable to about 480–450 BC.
(See image above.)

::&quot;uvamakozis plialeθu uvltiauiopos ariuonepos sitis tetu&quot;

Probably: &quot;Uvamakozis dedicated (literally &#x27;gave&#x27;) to Plialethos [these] &quot;uvltiaviop-s&quot;, &quot;arivonep-s&quot; [and] &quot;sits&quot; (&quot;sacred mounds&quot;? see note below).&quot;

Notes:
The name &quot;Uvamokozis&quot; probably is from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;up-mmo-ghostis&quot; &quot;having most esteemed guests&quot;, the last element developing through Proto-Celtic &quot;*gostis&quot; with further cognates in Old Church Slavonic &quot;gostъ&quot; and Gothic &quot;gasts&quot;. The apparent development of PIE *&quot;p&quot; to -v- here is of particular interest for understanding the development of this sound in Celtic (lost in most other branches). 

The form &quot;sitis&quot; is probably from PIE *&quot;sēdns&quot; &quot;seats&quot; an accusative plural; compare Old Irish &quot;sid&quot; &quot;sacred mound&quot; from &quot;seat (of the gods), and Latin &quot;sēdēs&quot;).

The final form &quot;tetu&quot; probably from PIE *&quot;deh3-&quot; &quot;give&quot;, seen also in Old Irish &quot;dorat&quot; &quot;has given&quot;, Gaulish &quot;dede&quot; and Celt-Iberian &quot;tatuz&quot; on the first Botorrita plaque.

<text>Mr. William Shakespeare&#x27;s Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies is a collection of plays by William Shakespeare, commonly referred to by modern scholars as the First Folio, published in 1623, about seven years after Shakespeare&#x27;s death. It is considered one of the most influential books ever published.

Printed in folio format and containing 36 of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, it was prepared by Shakespeare&#x27;s colleagues John Heminges and Henry Condell. It was dedicated to the &quot;incomparable pair of brethren&quot; William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, and his brother Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery (later 4th Earl of Pembroke).

Although 19 of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays had been published in quarto before 1623, the First Folio is arguably the only reliable text for about 20 of the plays, and a valuable source text for many of those previously published. Eighteen of the plays in the First Folio, including &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; among others, are not known to have been previously printed. The Folio includes all of the plays generally accepted to be Shakespeare&#x27;s, except the following plays which are believed likely to have been written, at least partly, by Shakespeare; &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;, &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;, &quot;Edward III&quot;, and the two lost plays, &quot;Cardenio&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Won&quot;. Some believe the last of these is an alternative title for a known published Shakespeare play.

Of perhaps 750 copies printed, 235 are known to remain, most of which are kept in either public archives or private collections. More than one third of the extant copies are housed at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., which is home to a total of 82 First Folios.

==Background==
After a long career as an actor, dramatist, and sharer in the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men (later the King&#x27;s Men) from until , William Shakespeare died in Stratford-upon-Avon, on 23 April 1616, and was buried in the chancel of the Church of the Holy Trinity two days later. 

Shakespeare&#x27;s works—both poetic and dramatic—had a rich history in print before the publication of the First Folio: from the first publications of &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; (1593) and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; (1594), 78 individual printed editions of his works are known. Of these, 23 are his poetry and the remaining 55 his plays. Counting by number of editions published before 1623, the best-selling works were &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; (12 editions), &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; (6 editions), and &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; (6 editions). Of the 23 editions of the poems, 16 were published in octavo; the rest, and almost all of the editions of the plays, were printed in quarto. The quarto format was made by folding a large sheet of printing paper twice, forming 4 leaves with 8 pages. The average quarto measured and was typically made up of 9 sheets, giving 72 total pages. Octavos—made by folding a sheet of the same size three times, forming 8 leaves with 16 pages—were about half as large as a quarto. Since the cost of paper represented about 50-75% of a book&#x27;s total production costs, octavos were generally cheaper to manufacture than quartos, and a common way to reduce publishing costs was to reduce the number of pages needed by compressing (using two columns or a smaller typeface) or abbreviating the text.
Editions of individual plays were typically published in quarto and could be bought for 6d () without a binding. These editions were primarily intended to be cheap and convenient, and read until worn out or repurposed as wrapping paper (or worse), rather than high quality objects kept in a library. Customers who wanted to keep a particular play would have to have it bound, and would typically bind several related or miscellany plays into one volume. Octavos, though nominally cheaper to produce, were somewhat different. From (&quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;) and 1598 (&quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;), Shakespeare&#x27;s narrative poems were published in octavo. In &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio&quot;, Tara L. Lyons argues that this was partly due to the publisher, John Harrison&#x27;s, desire to capitalize on the poems&#x27; association with Ovid: the Greek classics were sold in octavo, so printing Shakespeare&#x27;s poetry in the same format would strengthen the association. The octavo generally carried greater prestige, so the format itself would help to elevate their standing. Ultimately, however, the choice was a financial one: &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; in octavo needed four sheets of paper, versus seven in quarto, and the octavo &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot; needed five sheets, versus 12 in quarto. Whatever the motivation, the move seems to have had the intended effect: Francis Meres, the first known literary critic to comment on Shakespeare, in his &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot; (1598), puts it thus: &quot;the sweete wittie soule of &quot;Ouid&quot; liues in mellifluous &amp; hony-tongued &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, witnes his &quot;Venus&quot; an&quot;d&quot; &quot;Adonis&quot;, his &quot;Lucrece&quot;, his sugred Sonnets among his priuate friends&quot;.
Publishing literary works in folio was not unprecedented. Starting with the publication of Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;The Countess of Pembroke&#x27;s Arcadia&quot; (1593) and &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot; (1598), both published by William Ponsonby, there was a significant number of folios published, and a significant number of them were published by the men who would later be involved in publishing the First Folio. But quarto was the typical format for plays printed in the period: folio was a prestige format, typically used, according to Fredson Bowers, for books of &quot;superior merit or some permanent value&quot;. 

==Printing==
The contents of the First Folio were compiled by John Heminges and Henry Condell; the members of the Stationers Company who published the book were the booksellers Edward Blount and the father/son team of William and Isaac Jaggard. William Jaggard has seemed an odd choice by the King&#x27;s Men because he had published the questionable collection &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; as Shakespeare&#x27;s, and in 1619 had printed new editions of 10 Shakespearean quartos to which he did not have clear rights, some with false dates and title pages (the False Folio affair). Indeed, his contemporary Thomas Heywood, whose poetry Jaggard had pirated and misattributed to Shakespeare, specifically reports that Shakespeare was &quot;much offended with M. &quot;Jaggard&quot; (that altogether unknown to him) presumed to make so bold with his name.&quot;

Heminges and Condell emphasised that the Folio was replacing the earlier publications, which they characterised as &quot;stol&#x27;n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors&quot;, asserting that Shakespeare&#x27;s true words &quot;are now offer&#x27;d to your view cured, and perfect of their limbes; and all the rest, absolute in their numbers as he conceived them.&quot;

The paper industry in England was then in its infancy and the quantity of quality rag paper for the book was imported from France. It is thought that the typesetting and printing of the First Folio was such a large job that the King&#x27;s Men simply needed the capacities of the Jaggards&#x27; shop. William Jaggard was old, infirm and blind by 1623, and died a month before the book went on sale; most of the work in the project must have been done by his son Isaac.

The First Folio&#x27;s publishing syndicate also included two stationers who owned the rights to some of the individual plays that had been previously printed: William Aspley (&quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;) and John Smethwick (&quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost,&quot; &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;). Smethwick had been a business partner of another Jaggard, William&#x27;s brother John.

The printing of the Folio was probably done between February 1622 and early November 1623, and the book was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 8 November 1623 (Julian calendar). It is possible that the printer originally expected to have the book ready early, since it was listed in the Frankfurt Book Fair catalogue as a book to appear between April and October 1622, but the catalogue contained many books not yet printed by 1622, and the modern consensus is that the entry was simply intended as advance publicity. The first impression had a publication date of 1623, and the earliest record of a retail purchase is an account book entry for 5 December 1623 of Edward Dering (who purchased two); the Bodleian Library, in Oxford, received its copy in early 1624 (which it subsequently sold for £24 as a superseded edition when the Third Folio became available in 1663-1664).

==Contents==
The 36 plays of the First Folio occur in the order given below; plays that had never been published before 1623 are marked with an asterisk. Each play is followed by the type of source used, as determined by bibliographical research.

The term &quot;foul papers&quot; refers to Shakespeare&#x27;s working drafts of a play. When completed, a transcript or &quot;fair copy&quot; of the foul papers would be prepared, by the author or by a scribe. Such a manuscript would have to be heavily annotated with accurate and detailed stage directions and all the other data needed for performance, and then could serve as a &quot;prompt book&quot;, to be used by the prompter to guide a performance of the play. Any of these manuscripts, in any combination, could be used as a source for a printed text. The label Q&quot;n&quot; denotes the &quot;n&quot;th quarto edition of a play.

;Comedies
* 1 &quot;The Tempest&quot; * – The play was set into type from a manuscript prepared by Ralph Crane, a professional scrivener employed by the King&#x27;s Men. Crane produced a high-quality result, with formal act/scene divisions, frequent use of parentheses and hyphenated forms, and other identifiable features.
* 2 &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot; * – another transcript by Ralph Crane
* 3 &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; – another transcript by Ralph Crane
* 4 &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; * – probably another Ralph Crane transcript
* 5 &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; * – probably typeset from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;foul papers,&quot; lightly annotated
* 6 &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; – typeset from a copy of the quarto, lightly annotated
* 7 &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; – typeset from a corrected copy of Q1
* 8 &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; – typeset from a copy of Q2, well-annotated, possibly used as a prompt-book
* 9 &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; – typeset from a lightly edited and corrected copy of Q1
* 10 &quot;As You Like It&quot; * – from a quality manuscript, lightly annotated by a prompter
* 11 &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; * – typeset from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;foul papers,&quot; somewhat annotated, perhaps as preparation for use as a prompt-book
* 12 &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; * – probably from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;foul papers&quot; or a manuscript of them
* 13 &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; * – typeset either from a prompt-book or a transcript of one
* 14 &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; * – another transcript by Ralph Crane
;Histories
* 15 &quot;King John&quot; * – uncertain: a prompt-book, or &quot;foul papers.&quot;
* 16 &quot;Richard II&quot; – typeset from Q3 and Q5, corrected against a prompt-book
* 17 &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; – typeset from an edited copy of Q5
* 18 &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot; – uncertain: some combination of manuscript and quarto text
* 19 &quot;Henry V&quot; – typeset from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;foul papers.&quot;
* 20 &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot; * – likely from an annotated transcript of the author&#x27;s manuscript
* 21 &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot; – probably a Shakespearean manuscript used as a prompt-book
* 22 &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot; – like &quot;2H6&quot;, probably a Shakespearean prompt-book
* 23 &quot;Richard III&quot; – a difficult case: probably typeset partially from Q3, and partially from Q6 corrected against a manuscript (maybe &quot;foul papers&quot;)
* 24 &quot;Henry VIII&quot; * – typeset from a fair copy of the authors&#x27; manuscript
;Tragedies
* 25 &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; – probably typeset from the quarto, corrected with Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;foul papers,&quot; printed after the rest of the Folio was completed
* 26 &quot;Coriolanus&quot; * – set from a high-quality authorial transcript
* 27 &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; – typeset from a copy of Q3 that might have served as a prompt-book
* 28 &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; – in essence a reprint of Q3
* 29 &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; * – set from Shakespeare&#x27;s foul papers or a transcript of them
* 30 &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; * – set from a prompt-book, or a transcript of a prompt-book
* 31 &quot;Macbeth&quot; * – probably set from a prompt-book, perhaps detailing an adaptation of the play for a short indoor performance
* 32 &quot;Hamlet&quot; – one of the most difficult problems in the First Folio: probably typeset from some combination of Q2 and manuscript sources
* 33 &quot;King Lear&quot; – a difficult problem: probably set mainly from Q1 but with reference to Q2, and corrected against a prompt-book
* 34 &quot;Othello&quot; – another difficult problem: probably typeset from Q1, corrected with a quality manuscript
* 35 &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; * – possibly &quot;foul papers&quot; or a transcript of them
* 36 &quot;Cymbeline&quot; * – possibly another Ralph Crane transcript, or else the official prompt-book

&quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; was originally intended to follow &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, but the typesetting was stopped, probably due to a conflict over the rights to the play; it was later inserted as the first of the tragedies, when the rights question was resolved. It does not appear in the table of contents.

==Introductory poem==
Ben Jonson wrote a preface to the folio with this poem addressed &quot;To the Reader&quot; facing the Droeshout portrait engraving:
==Compositors==
As far as modern scholarship has been able to determine, the First Folio texts were set into type by five compositors, with different spelling habits, peculiarities, and levels of competence. Researchers have labelled them A through E, A being the most accurate, and E an apprentice who had significant difficulties in dealing with manuscript copy. Their shares in typesetting the pages of the Folio break down like this:

Compositor &quot;E&quot; was most likely one John Leason, whose apprenticeship contract dated only from 4 November 1622. One of the other four might have been a John Shakespeare, of Warwickshire, who apprenticed with Jaggard in 1610 to 1617. (&quot;Shakespeare&quot; was a common name in Warwickshire in that era; John was of no known relation to the playwright.)

== The First Folio and variants ==

W. W. Greg has argued that Edward Knight, the &quot;book-keeper&quot; or &quot;book-holder&quot; (prompter) of the King&#x27;s Men, did the actual proofreading of the manuscript sources for the First Folio. Knight is known to have been responsible for maintaining and annotating the company&#x27;s scripts, and making sure that the company complied with cuts and changes ordered by the Master of the Revels.

Some pages of the First Folio—134 out of the total of 900—were proofread and corrected while the job of printing the book was ongoing. As a result, the Folio differs from modern books in that individual copies vary considerably in their typographical errors. There were about 500 corrections made to the Folio in this way. These corrections by the typesetters, however, consisted only of simple typos, clear mistakes in their own work; the evidence suggests that they almost never referred back to their manuscript sources, let alone tried to resolve any problems in those sources. The well-known cruxes in the First Folio texts were beyond the typesetters&#x27; capacity to correct.

The Folio was typeset and bound in &quot;sixes&quot;—3 sheets of paper, taken together, were folded into a booklet-like quire or gathering of 6 leaves, 12 pages. Once printed, the &quot;sixes&quot; were assembled and bound together to make the book. The sheets were printed in 2-page formes, meaning that pages 1 and 12 of the first quire were printed simultaneously on one side of one sheet of paper (which became the &quot;outer&quot; side); then pages 2 and 11 were printed on the other side of the same sheet (the &quot;inner&quot; side). The same was done with pages 3 and 10, and 4 and 9, on the second sheet, and pages 5 and 8, and 6 and 7, on the third. Then the first quire could be assembled with its pages in the correct order. The next quire was printed by the same method: pages 13 and 24 on one side of one sheet, etc. This meant that the text being printed had to be &quot;cast off&quot;—the compositors had to plan beforehand how much text would fit onto each page. If the compositors were setting type from manuscripts (perhaps messy, revised and corrected manuscripts), their calculations would frequently be off by greater or lesser amounts, resulting in the need to expand or compress. A line of verse could be printed as two; or verse could be printed as prose to save space, or lines and passages could even be omitted (a disturbing prospect for those who prize Shakespeare&#x27;s works).

The First Folio was reprinted three times in the 17th century, each time by different groups of stationers; these editions are referred to as the Second Folio, Third Folio, and Fourth Folio.

==Holdings, sales and valuations==

Jean-Christophe Mayer, in &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio&quot; (2016), estimates the original retail price of the First Folio to be about 15s () for an unbound copy, and up to £1 () for one bound in calfskin. In terms of purchasing power, &quot;a bound folio would be about forty times the price of a single play and represented almost two months&#x27; wages for an ordinary skilled worker.&quot;

It is believed that around 750 copies of the First Folio were printed, of which there are 235 known surviving copies. 

=== Holdings ===
The world&#x27;s largest collection is in the possession of the Folger Shakespeare Library (82 copies) in Washington, D.C., followed by Meisei University (12) in Tokyo, the New York Public Library (6) in New York City, and the British Library (5) in London. The Folger collection alone accounts for more than one third of all known surviving copies. Together, the nine largest First Folio collections comprise more than half of all known extant copies. 

Thirty-one American colleges and universities own a total of thirty-eight copies of the First Folio, while seven British universities own fourteen copies. Universities in possession of multiple copies include the University of Cambridge (4), the University of Oxford (4), the University of Texas at Austin (3), Princeton University (3), Brown University (2), Harvard University (2), the University of London (2), Yale University (1) and Carnegie Mellon University (2). Three are also in the possession of the University of California system, with one each at UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC Irvine. In Canada, the University of Toronto&#x27;s Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library owns one copy and the University of British Columbia another. Ireland&#x27;s only copy resides in the Old Library at Trinity College Dublin.

A number of copies are held by public libraries. In the United States, the New York Public Library owns six copies. The Boston Public Library, Free Library of Philadelphia (a copy previously owned by John Milton and containing notes in his handwriting), Dallas Public Library, and Buffalo &amp; Erie County Public Library each hold one copy. In the UK, the Library of Birmingham owns one copy.

Additional copies are owned by the Huntington Library (4), The Shakespeare Centre (3), the Victoria and Albert Museum (3), Sutro Library (2), the Morgan Library and Museum (2), Newberry Library, Fondation Martin Bodmer, the State Library of New South Wales, the Auckland Central City Library, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, and the National Library of Chile, in Santiago.

=== Sales and valuations ===
The First Folio is one of the most valuable printed books in the world: a copy sold at Christie&#x27;s in New York in October 2001 made $6.16 million hammer price (then £3.73m). In October 2020, a copy sold by Mills College at Christie&#x27;s fetched a price of $10 million, making it the most expensive work of literature ever auctioned.

Oriel College, Oxford, raised a conjectured £3.5 million from the sale of its First Folio to Sir Paul Getty in 2003.

To commemorate the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare&#x27;s death in 2016, the Folger Shakespeare Library toured some of its 82 First Folios for display in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.

===Discoveries of previously unknown Folios===
In 2003, Anthony West identified a book previously thought to be a Second Folio in the collection of Craven Museum in Skipton, North Yorkshire, to be a First Folio. It had been donated to the museum in 1936 by a local mill owner. This copy is missing its introductory pages and all the comedies.

On 13 July 2006, a complete copy of the First Folio owned by Dr Williams&#x27;s Library was auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s auction house. The book, which was in its original 17th-century binding, sold for £2,808,000, less than Sotheby&#x27;s top estimate of £3.5 million. This copy is one of only about 40 remaining complete copies (most of the existing copies are incomplete); only one other copy of the book remains in private ownership.

On 11 July 2008, it was reported that a copy stolen from Durham University, England, in 1998 had been recovered after being submitted for valuation at the Folger Shakespeare Library. News reports estimated the folio&#x27;s value at anywhere from £250,000 in total for the First Folio and all the other books and manuscripts stolen (&quot;BBC News&quot;, 1998), up to $30 million (&quot;The New York Times&quot;, 2008). Although the book, once the property of John Cosin the Bishop of Durham, was returned to the library, it had been mutilated and was missing its cover and title page. The folio was returned to public display on 19 June 2010 after its twelve-year absence. Fifty-three-year-old Raymond Scott received an eight-year prison sentence for handling stolen goods, but was acquitted of the theft itself. A July 2010 BBC programme about the affair, &quot;Stealing Shakespeare&quot;, portrayed Scott as a fantasist and petty thief. In 2013, Scott killed himself in his prison cell.

In November 2014, a previously unknown First Folio was found in a public library in Saint-Omer, Pas-de-Calais in France, where it had lain for 200 years. Confirmation of its authenticity came from Eric Rasmussen of the University of Nevada, Reno, one of the world&#x27;s foremost authorities on Shakespeare. The title page and introductory material are missing. The name &quot;Neville&quot;, written on the first surviving page, may indicate that it once belonged to Edward Scarisbrick, who fled England due to anti-Catholic repression, attended the Jesuit Saint-Omer College, and was known to use that alias. 

In March 2016, Christie&#x27;s announced that a previously unrecorded copy once owned by 19th-century collector Sir George Augustus Shuckburgh-Evelyn would be auctioned on 25 May 2016. According to the &quot;Antiques Trade Gazette&quot;, an American collector paid £1,600,000 for it; the buyer also successfully bid on copies of the second, third, and fourth folios.

In April 2016, another new discovery was announced, a First Folio having been found in Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute, Scotland. It was authenticated by Professor Emma Smith of Oxford University. The Folio originally belonged to Isaac Reed.

Indeed, Smith suggests, that is what we continually do, exaggerating its rarity, inflating its price, overlooking its textual and bibliographic weaknesses, fantasizing about its relation to Shakespeare himself, and forgetting or willfully obscuring the million accidents and historical contingencies that have facilitated its rise.&quot; (p. 57.)

<text>Isoniazid, also known as isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH), is an antibiotic used for the treatment of tuberculosis. For active tuberculosis, it is often used together with rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. For latent tuberculosis, it is often used alone. It may also be used for atypical types of mycobacteria, such as &quot;M. avium&quot;, &quot;M. kansasii&quot;, and &quot;M. xenopi&quot;. It is usually taken by mouth, but may be used by injection into muscle.

==History==
After F. Raschig developed a method to synthesize hydrazine, Hans Meyer and his doctoral student at the German University in Prague Josef Mally studied hydrazides of pyridinecarboxylic acids. By reacting ethyl isonicotinate with hydrazine hydrate they obtained a compound which, after a recrystallization, had a melting point of 163°C. Despite their results published in 1912, its pharmaceutical properties weren&#x27;t investigated for decades.

In the 1940s French physicians discovered that nicotinamide had some activity against tubercle bacilli in vitro and in infected guinea pigs. At the same time, German chemists led by G. Domagk investigating sulfo drugs at Bayer developed thioacetazone. After their findings were made public, in 1950 modified it to the less toxic thiosemicarbazone of nicotinaldehyde while H. H. Fox developed similar isonicotinaldehyde thiosemicarbazone. Soon, multiple laboratories discovered anti-TB activity of isoniazid.

It&#x27;s believed that Soviet physicians and Bella Keyfman also discovered this activity in 1949 but neither published their findings in a peer-reviewed article nor applied for an inventor&#x27;s certificate.

Three pharmaceutical companies unsuccessfully attempted to patent the drug at the same time, the most prominent one being Roche in January 1951, which launched its version, Rimifon, in 1952. 

The drug was first tested at Many Farms, a Navajo community in Arizona, due to the Navajo reservation&#x27;s tuberculosis problem and because the population had not previously been treated with streptomycin, the main tuberculosis treatment at the time. The research was led by Walsh McDermott, an infectious disease researcher with an interest in public health, who had previously taken isoniazid to treat his own tuberculosis.

Isoniazid and a related drug, iproniazid, were among the first drugs to be referred to as antidepressants. Psychiatric use stopped in 1961 following reports of hepatotoxicity. Use against tuberculosis continued, as isoniazid&#x27;s effectiveness against the disease outweighs its risks.

It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies isoniazid as critically important for human medicine. Isoniazid is available as a generic medication.

==Medical uses==
===Tuberculosis===
Isoniazid is often used to treat latent and active tuberculosis infections. In persons with isoniazid-sensitive &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid are usually effective when persons adhere to the prescribed treatment. However, in persons with isoniazid-resistant &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid have a high rate of failure.

Isoniazid has been approved as prophylactic therapy for the following populations:
* People with HIV infection and a PPD (purified protein derivative) reaction of at least 5 mm induration
* Contacts of people with tuberculosis and who have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration
* People whose PPD reactions convert from negative to positive in a two-year period – at least 10 mm induration for those up to 35 years of age, and at least 15 mm induration for those at least 35 years old
* People with pulmonary damage on their chest X-ray that is likely to be due to healed tuberculosis and also have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration
* Injection drug users whose HIV status is negative who have a PPD reaction at least 10 mm induration
* People with a PPD of greater than or equal to 10 mm induration who are foreign-born from high prevalence geographical regions, low-income populations, and patients residing in long-term facilities

Isoniazid can be used alone or in combination with Rifampin for treatment of latent tuberculosis, or as part of a four-drug regimen for treatment of active tuberculosis. The drug regimen typically requires daily or weekly oral administration for a period of three to nine months, often under Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) supervision.

===Non-tuberculous mycobacteria===
Isoniazid was widely used in the treatment of &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex as part of a regimen including rifampicin and ethambutol. Evidence suggests that isoniazid prevents mycolic acid synthesis in &quot;M. avium&quot; complex as in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; and although this is not bactericidal to &quot;M. avium&quot; complex, it greatly potentiates the effect of rifampicin. The introduction of macrolides led to this use greatly decreasing. However, since rifampicin is broadly underdosed in &quot;M. avium&quot; complex treatment, this effect may be worth re-investigating.

===Special populations===
It is recommended that women with active tuberculosis who are pregnant or breastfeeding take isoniazid. Preventive therapy should be delayed until after giving birth. Nursing mothers excrete a relatively low and non-toxic concentration of INH in breast milk, and their babies are at low risk for side effects. Both pregnant women and infants being breastfed by mothers taking INH should take vitamin B6 in its pyridoxine form to minimize the risk of peripheral nerve damage.
Vitamin B6 is used to prevent isoniazid-induced B6 deficiency and neuropathy in people with a risk factor, such as pregnancy, lactation, HIV infection, alcoholism, diabetes, kidney failure, or malnutrition.

People with liver dysfunction are at a higher risk for hepatitis caused by INH, and may need a lower dose.

Levels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers, pregnant women, IV drug users, people over 35, and those who have chronic liver disease, severe kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH.

==Side effects==
Up to 20% of people taking isoniazid experience peripheral neuropathy when taking daily doses of 6 mg/kg of body weight or higher. Gastrointestinal reactions include nausea and vomiting. Aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis due to lack of production of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells by the bone marrow respectively, can also occur. Hypersensitivity reactions are also common and can present with a maculopapular rash and fever. Gynecomastia may occur.

Asymptomatic elevation of serum liver enzyme concentrations occurs in 10% to 20% of people taking INH, and liver enzyme concentrations usually return to normal even when treatment is continued. Isoniazid has a boxed warning for severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis, which is age-dependent at a rate of 0.3% in people 21 to 35 years old and over 2% in those over age 50. Symptoms suggestive of liver toxicity include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, and loss of appetite. Black and Hispanic women are at higher risk for isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity. When it happens, isoniazid-induced liver toxicity has been shown to occur in 50% of patients within the first 2 months of therapy.

Some recommend that liver function should be monitored carefully in all people receiving it, but others recommend monitoring only in certain populations.

Headache, poor concentration, weight gain, poor memory, insomnia, and depression have all been associated with isoniazid use. All patients and healthcare workers should be aware of these serious side effects, especially if suicidal ideation or behavior are suspected.

Isoniazid is associated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency because of its similar structure. Isoniazid is also associated with increased excretion of pyridoxine. Pyridoxal phosphate (a derivative of pyridoxine) is required for δ-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in heme synthesis. Therefore, isoniazid-induced pyridoxine deficiency causes insufficient heme formation in early red blood cells, leading to sideroblastic anemia.

Isoniazid was found to significantly elevate the in vivo concentration of GABA and homocarnosine in a single subject via magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

==Drug interactions==
People taking isoniazid and acetaminophen are at risk of acetaminophen toxicity. Isoniazid is thought to induce a liver enzyme which causes a larger amount of acetaminophen to be metabolized to a toxic form.

Isoniazid decreases the metabolism of carbamazepine, thus slowing down its clearance from the body. People taking carbamazepine should have their carbamazepine levels monitored and, if necessary, have their dose adjusted accordingly.

It is possible that isoniazid may decrease the serum levels of ketoconazole after long-term treatment. This is seen with the simultaneous use of rifampin, isoniazid, and ketoconazole.

Isoniazid may increase the amount of phenytoin in the body. The doses of phenytoin may need to be adjusted when given with isoniazid.

Isoniazid may increase the plasma levels of theophylline. There are some cases of theophylline slowing down isoniazid elimination. Both theophylline and isoniazid levels should be monitored.

Valproate levels may increase when taken with isoniazid. Valproate levels should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary.

==Mechanism of action==
Isoniazid is a prodrug that inhibits the formation of the mycobacterial cell wall. Isoniazid must be activated by KatG, a bacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme in &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;. KatG catalyzes the formation of the isonicotinic acyl radical, which spontaneously couples with NADH to form the nicotinoyl-NAD adduct. This complex binds tightly to the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase InhA, thereby blocking the natural enoyl-AcpM substrate and the action of fatty acid synthase. This process inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are required components of the mycobacterial cell wall. A range of radicals are produced by KatG activation of isoniazid, including nitric oxide, which has also been shown to be important in the action of another antimycobacterial prodrug pretomanid.

Isoniazid is bactericidal to rapidly dividing mycobacteria, but is bacteriostatic if the mycobacteria are slow-growing. It inhibits the cytochrome P450 system and hence acts as a source of free radicals.

Isoniazid is a mild non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I). It inhibits diamine oxidase more strongly. These two actions are possible explanations for its antidepressant action as well as its ability to cause mania.

==Metabolism==
Isoniazid reaches therapeutic concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and within caseous granulomas. It is metabolized in the liver via acetylation into acetylhydrazine. Two forms of the enzyme are responsible for acetylation, so some patients metabolize the drug more quickly than others. Hence, the half-life is bimodal, with &quot;slow acetylators&quot; and &quot;fast acetylators&quot;. A graph of number of people versus time shows peaks at one and three hours. The height of the peaks depends on the ethnicities of the people being tested. The metabolites are excreted in the urine. Doses do not usually have to be adjusted in case of renal failure.

==Preparation==
Isoniazid is an isonicotinic acid derivative. It is manufactured using 4-cyanopyridine and hydrazine hydrate. In another method, isoniazid was claimed to have been made from citric acid starting material.

It can in theory be made from methyl isonicotinate, which is labelled a semiochemical.

==Brand names==
Hydra, Hyzyd, Isovit, Laniazid, Nydrazid, Rimifon, and Stanozide.

==Other uses==
===Chromatography===
Isonicotinic acid hydrazide is also used in chromatography to differentiate between various degrees of conjugation in organic compounds barring the ketone functional group. The test works by forming a hydrazone which can be detected by its bathochromic shift.

===Dogs===
Isoniazid may be used for dogs, but there have been concerns it can cause seizures.

<text>Hocking Hills State Park is a state park in the Hocking Hills region of Hocking County, Ohio, United States. In some areas the park adjoins the Hocking State Forest. Within the park are over of hiking trails, rock formations, waterfalls, and recess caves. The trails are open from dawn to dusk, all year round, including holidays.

The park contains seven separate hiking areas: Ash Cave, Cantwell Cliffs, Cedar Falls, Conkle&#x27;s Hollow (nature preserve), Old Man&#x27;s Cave, Rock House and Hemlock Bridge Trail to Whispering Cave.

==History==
The name Hocking Hills

Hocking County was named after the Hockhocking River. Hockhocking, in the Delaware tongue, signifies a bottle. In Shawnee, Wea-tha-Kagh-Qua-sepe, meant bottle river. The Hockhocking River had a waterfall of nearly 20 feet located about 6 or 7 miles northwest of Lancaster. Above the falls, the creek was very narrow and straight, forming the &quot;bottle&quot; neck.

The Hockhocking enters the county from Good Hope Township in the northwest and then flows southwest, touches Marion Township, continues through Falls and Green Townships, and exits the county through northwestern Starr Township. The river is then in Athens County.


History of the Park

More than 330 million years ago, the area was relatively level and covered by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. For millions of years, the ocean&#x27;s currents deposited immense amounts of sand and gravel. After millions of years, the ocean receded, and the sandy layers bonded with silica to form the Black Hand Sandstone that underlies the area. It formed like a sandwich, with a hard top and bottom and a soft middle layer. When the Appalachian Mountains arose, form and feature were cast upon the area and created the Hocking Hills.

Hocking Hills were hemmed in by the ancient north-flowing Teays River to the west, and the then north-flowing Hocking to the east. The landscape remained fairly static for millions of years. Any changes were minuscule, and were slow to develop. When the Wisconsin Glacier began melting back to the north about 10,000 years ago, the landscape would undergo dramatic changes. The glacier stopped in northern Hocking County, so the area suffered indescribable flooding. The ancient Teays River was buried under tons of glacial silt, and the direction of the Hocking River was reversed.

When the glacial torrents found cracks in the hard capstone, the water poured through to flush out the soft middle layer. This left long tunnels where the gorges are today. Eventually, the weight of the tops caused them to come crashing down. The &quot;slump rocks&quot; in the gorges today are what&#x27;s left of the hard top layer. In just a few centuries, the rushing waters of the glacier carved the soft middle layer of sandstone into the myriad dimples and wrinkles that decorate the cliffs and grottos today.

Early settlers in Muskingum County found an ancient black human handprint on a cliff that is part of this same sandstone formation. That is the same &quot;Black Hand Sandstone&quot; that is seen in six areas of the Hocking Hills State Park.

The Adena culture is believed to be one of the first inhabitants of the area of Hocking Hills. In the 18th century, the Native American Tribes of Delaware, Wyandot, and Shawnee travelled through and lived in the area. In 1818, Hocking County was created in Ohio. A powder mill was built in the area in the 1830s and in 1840 Hocking Canal was completed, allowing for more settlers to travel there. After local popular hiking areas were threatened by the accessibility of more traffic, the State Forest Law was passed in 1915 allowing the state to purchase the first parcel of land in Hocking Hills around Old Man&#x27;s Cave.

Hocking Honor Camp Reforestation

Hocking Hills&#x27; iconic and unusual hemlock forest of Hocking Hills was extensively established by the Civilian Conservation Corp and Division of Forestry in the 1930s. Additional planting and reforestry work took place during the 1950s by &quot;prisoners from the Hocking Honor Camp.&quot; Inmates &quot;worked on tree planting, cleaning plantations and pruning more established plantations. The prisoners earned five cents per hour for their labor if they had dependents, otherwise they earned half a cent per hour for their hard work.&quot; This unique model of using inmates to provide social good is striking. According to the Logan Daily News, Hocking Honor inmates &quot;worked closely with the Hocking County area and the community, an idea that seems absurd today&quot;

==Tourist accommodations==
There are about 200 campsites in Hocking Hills State Park Campground, including full hookup and electric camp sites with 20-, 30- or 50-amp service, and camping shelters. The park also offers primitive &quot;hike-in&quot; tent-only sites and a primitive Group Camp in their own areas of the park. The campground is close to all of the hiking trails in the area and has flush toilets, shower houses with hot water, vending machines, a camp store, a pool, and other amenities. Reservations for camping may be made up to 6 months in advance.

A full-service resort lodge, Hocking Hills State Park Lodge and Conference Center, opened in the state park in autumn 2022 and offers 81 guest rooms as well as a full-service restaurant, fitness room, and indoor and outdoor swimming pools. The lodge is also the point of contact for cabin stays inside the state park. Reservations for the Lodge and Cabins are made through the contracted management company, Great Ohio Lodges.

There are also many privately owned cabins and hotels in the area.

In 2017, over 2 million people visited Hocking Hills. To handle the growing tourism, a summer shuttle service from downtown Logan began to lessen the overtaxing on the park&#x27;s parking facilities.

==Attractions==

The area is very popular with tourists and collectively is known as the Hocking Hills Region. It features many private inns, campgrounds, cabins, restaurants, and other related businesses, including a recently developed zipline. Other attractions include:

*Nature Preserves and State Parks: Nearby are also other attractions of the Hocking Hills, including Hocking State Forest, Conkles Hollow State Nature Preserve, Lake Logan State Park, and Rockbridge State Nature Preserve. The deep gorges and high cliffs result from the erosion-resistant Blackhand Sandstone, which extends well to the northeast of the Hocking Hills. Other open-space areas have been established within the range of the Blackhand, including Lake Katharine State Nature Preserve. 
* Lakes: Lake Logan in Hocking Hills State Park covers 400 acres, 320 acres of which is dry land, and is two miles long. The lake was built in 1955 for recreational purposes and offers visitors hiking, boating, picnicking and swimming.
* Canoeing and kayaking are popular activities in the Hocking Hills 
* Boating: Canoeing, kayaking and rafting are all allowed on various places in the state park.
* Rock Climbing and Rappelling: Ninety-nine acres of forest land have been set aside for rock climbing and rappelling in Hocking State Forest.
* Swimming: Lake Logan offers swimming and beaches for visitors. There is also a swimming pool open to the public outside of the Hocking Hills State Park lodge. 
* Hunting and fishing: Hunting and fishing are permitted as regulated by the Division of Wildlife. With permits, visitors are allowed to hunt during hunting season. Fishing is permitted in Lake Logan and Rose Lake, which can include a variety of fish such as bluegill, crappie, bass, saugeye and catfish.

* Bird Watching: Hocking Valley Birding Trail identifies opportunities for bird watchers to enjoy the avian life in Hocking Hills. 
* Archery: The Hocking Hills State Park offers a free archery range. 
* Air Tours: Hocking Hills Scenic Air Tours offers airplane rides with views of the State Park.
* Horseback Riding: Hocking Hills State Park provides horseback riding trails that share space with both hiking trails and hunting areas.
* Train Rides: The trains of the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway provide visitors a glimpse into the transportation and industrial history of the Hocking Hills area.
* Weddings: Some individuals have chosen to use the State Park as their outdoor wedding ceremony location.
* Canopy Tours: Nearby the State Park is Hocking Hills Canopy Tours, an outdoor zipline tour that offers three different rides: a SuperZip, Nightflight and traditional canopy tour. The Hocking Hills region was recently named the Canopy Tour Capital of the Midwest.
* Astronomy: The John Glenn Astronomy Park, named after astronaut and US Senator John Glenn, opened in June 2018. During the day, visitors can study the position of the Sun and orientation throughout the year. At night, visitors can see the planets and stars not being obstructed by light pollution.

Flora

==In popular culture==

Many of the adventures in Jeff Smith&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Bone&quot; take place in Old Man&#x27;s Cave, a place inspired by the Hocking Hills State Park, which Smith enjoyed since he was a child. The waterfalls of the park also influenced Smith&#x27;s frequent use of water as a recurring visual element in &quot;Bone&quot;, calling it &quot;an age-old storytelling symbol&quot;.

==Other public lands==

As noted, Hocking Hills State Park is embedded within the Hocking State Forest. Crane Hollow Nature Preserve, a private preserve, fills in a large part of the non-public area. On the south side, Camp Oti-Okwa, owned by Big Brothers-Big Sisters, is also a sizeable protected area. There are three state nature preserves within the Forest, but only Conkles Hollow State Nature Preserve is open to the public. Also nearby are Clear Creek Metro Park, Lake Logan State Park, and Rockbridge State Nature Preserve.

<doc id="599513" wikidata="Q1856247" url="?curid=599513" title="Pendragon (band)">
<text>Pendragon are an English neo-prog band established in 1978 in Stroud, Gloucestershire as Zeus Pendragon by guitarist and vocalist Nick Barrett. The word &quot;Zeus&quot; was dropped before the band started recording, as the members decided it was too long to look good on a T-shirt. There were a few personnel changes in the early days, but since 1986 the lineup has remained relatively stable (with only the drummer changing several times since then) and the band are still active as of 2024.

==History==
The band were active in the progressive rock revival spearheaded by the likes of Marillion, Pallas, Solstice and Twelfth Night in the early 1980s, and indeed (like their peers IQ) often appeared as support acts to Marillion and other major neo-prog bands, both on tours and at the Marquee venue which hosted many regular prog evenings.

In spring 1984 the band took part in a &#x27;battle of the bands&#x27; contest at Goldiggers club, in Chippenham, televised by the local HTV television station. This was named &#x27;Best Bands West&#x27; and Pendragon performed O Devineo (spelling as credited on TV). A Bristol-based covers duo eventually won the contest. After their debut album &quot;The Jewel&quot;, the band pursued a more commercial direction, documented in the &quot;Kowtow&quot; album and the &quot;Red Shoes&quot; and &quot;Saved By You&quot; EPs, but despite these efforts failed to break through to a mainstream audience. The group appeared at the 1983 Reading Festival and were signed to Elusive Records.

===1991 - Toff Records===
In 1991, the band established their own label, Toff Records, and released the archival release &quot;The Rest of Pendragon&quot;, a collection of EP tracks, and the studio album &quot;The World&quot;, in which they returned to a more progressive style that the band would continue to develop over their next three studio albums, &quot;The Window of Life&quot;, &quot;The Masquerade Overture&quot;, and &quot;Not of This World&quot;.

From this point on their fortunes have improved, and while they are still relatively obscure in their home country they have a significant following in Europe; in particular, they have managed to develop a strong fanbase in Poland, and have both released at least one compilation specifically for the Polish market and recorded several live albums there.

===2002 - Acoustically Challenged===
In 2002, the band released &quot;Acoustically Challenged&quot;, documenting an &quot;unplugged&quot; session with a number of the band&#x27;s songs retooled for acoustic instruments, which was originally broadcast on Radio 3 Warsaw. This was considered an unusual move for a progressive rock band, since progressive rock tends to focus a lot on the use of electronic synthesisers and electric guitars; however, the melodic qualities of the band&#x27;s compositions proved to be well-suited to an acoustic context, and the album was reasonably successful. This heralded a new willingness to experiment on the part of the band, following a run of studio albums all broadly in the same vein as &quot;The World&quot;. On 2005&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot; they took their music in a somewhat darker direction, causing a certain amount of controversy amongst their fans. 2008&#x27;s &quot;Pure&quot;, which featured elements of progressive metal, refined the style of &quot;Believe&quot; and was well received by the progressive rock fandom, being voted Album of the Year 2008 on DPRP.

On 21 April 2009, Pendragon released a live album and DVD, Concerto Maximo, shot in Katowice on 13 October 2008. It was filmed and edited by &quot;Metal Mind&quot;. It was released in several versions – a 2-CD release that features just the audio from the show, a DVD featuring the full show, and a DVD-and-2-CD special edition, which was limited to 1000 copies.

In October 2010, the band recorded the follow-up to &quot;Pure&quot;, the album &quot;Passion&quot; which was released in the spring of 2011. This was followed by &quot;Men Who Climb Mountains&quot; in 2014. Both albums continued the darker, heavier, more progressive metal-influenced direction of the band.

===Since 2014===
In April 2014, the band announced that they had parted ways with drummer Scott Higham for &quot;personal reasons&quot;. He was then replaced by Craig Blundell. In June 2015, Blundell was replaced by Jan-Vincent Velazco.

In September 2019 the band released a 40th Anniversary boxed set containing five compact discs. The first three represent a complete live concert recording made in London during 2018. The remaining two discs are re-mixed and remastered versions of the albums &quot;The World&quot; and &quot;Men Who Climb Mountains&quot;. In February 2020, a new album called &quot;Love Over Fear&quot; was released.

<doc id="599514" wikidata="Q14218323" url="?curid=599514" title="Hocking Hills">
<text>The Hocking Hills is a deeply dissected area of the Allegheny Plateau in Appalachian Ohio, primarily in Hocking County, that features cliffs, gorges, rock shelters, and waterfalls. The relatively extreme topography in this area is due to the Blackhand Sandstone (so named because of Native American graphics on the formation near Newark, Ohio), a particular formation that is thick, hard and weather-resistant, and so forms high cliffs and narrow, deep gorges.

==Component open-space areas==
Most of the more scenic areas of the region are under state ownership, including:
*Hocking Hills State Park (with five use areas: Ash Cave, Cedar Falls, Old Man&#x27;s Cave, Rockhouse, and Cantwell Cliffs) 
*Hocking State Forest
*Conkle&#x27;s Hollow State Nature Preserve
*Sheick Hollow State Nature Preserve (entry by permit only)
*Little Rocky Hollow State Nature Preserve (entry by permit only)
*Kessler Swamp State Nature Preserve
*Lake Logan State Park
*Wayne National Forest
*Rockbridge State Nature Preserve

The core area also includes two privately owned preserves, Crane Hollow and Camp Oty-Okwa (owned by Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Central Ohio).

The geological series that forms the Hocking Hills extends south and west, gradually diminishing but still forming impressive bluffs and gorges in:
*Clear Creek Metro Park, part of the Columbus and Franklin County Metropolitan Park District
*Rising Park in Lancaster
*Wahkeena Memorial State Nature Preserve in Fairfield County
*Christmas Rocks State Nature Preserve in Fairfield County 
*Rhododendron Cove State Nature Preserve in Fairfield County 
*Shallenberger State Nature Preserve in Fairfield County 
*Saltpetre Cave State Nature Preserve in Hocking County
*Boch Hollow State Nature Preserve (exposure is along the westernmost edge only) in Hocking County
*Lake Katharine State Nature Preserve in Jackson County
*Blackhand Gorge State Nature Preserve in Licking County
*Liberty Wildlife Area in Jackson County

The Buckeye Trail, along with the North Country Trail and the American Discovery Trail, passes through the Hocking Hills region.
Also nearby are:
*Lake Hope State Park
*Zaleski State Forest
*Camp Wyandot
*Tar Hollow State Park
*Tar Hollow State Forest
*Camp Akita (UCC church camp)

==Climate==
The region has mild weather with an average rainfall of 40.3 inches per year and an average of about 175 sunny days per year. The average July high is 84.8 degrees Fahrenheit and the average January low is 19.3 degrees Fahrenheit. 
==History==

The region was first settled by Christian Eby and was named from a shortened version of the Hockhocking River by the Shawnee Indian tribe. &quot;Hockhocking&quot;, in the Delaware tongue, signifies a bottle. The Shawnee people thought that a very narrow and straight creek above the waterfall on the Hockhocking River resembled a bottle&#x27;s neck.

Other notable settlers were George Starkey and Moses Dolson. The first election on county matters was held in Eby&#x27;s mill near Queer Creek. The first post office in the area was called the &quot;Rockhouse&quot; and was located in Herschel Badford&#x27;s home.

==Hocking County formation==
Hocking County was formed on March 1, 1818, from Ross, Athens, Fairfield and Logan. The county&#x27;s boundaries and townships have not been altered since 1851. Due to its natural surroundings, it has become a tourist attraction.

<doc id="599527" wikidata="Q606621" url="?curid=599527" title="Siege of Szigetvár">
<text>The siege of Szigetvár or the Battle of Szigeth (pronunciation: [ˈsiɡɛtvaːr]; ; ; ) was an Ottoman siege of the fortress of Szigetvár in the Kingdom of Hungary. The fort had blocked Sultan Suleiman&#x27;s line of advance towards Vienna in 1566. The battle was fought between the defending forces of the Habsburg monarchy under the leadership of Nikola IV Zrinski, the former Ban of Croatia, and the invading Ottoman army under the nominal command of Sultan Suleiman.

In January 1566, Suleiman began his offensive campaign in Hungary. The siege of Szigetvár was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and it resulted in an Ottoman victory. Some historians have viewed the victory as pyrrhic as there were heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the course of the siege Zrinski during the final charge, and Suleiman in his tent from natural causes. The siege lasted for a total of 33 days.

More than 20,000 Ottomans died during the siege, and almost all of Zrinski&#x27;s 2,300-man garrison was killed, with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day. Although the Ottomans were victorious, the siege stopped the planned Ottoman push towards Vienna that year. Vienna was not threatened again until the Battle of Vienna in 1683.

The importance of the battle was considered so great that the French clergyman and statesman Cardinal Richelieu was reported to have described it as &quot;the battle that saved (Western) civilization&quot;. The battle is still famous in Croatia and Hungary and inspired both the Hungarian epic poem &quot;The Siege of Sziget&quot; and the Croatian opera &quot;Nikola Šubić Zrinski&quot;.

==Background==
=== Historical events ===
A peace agreement between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans was in effect until 1552, when Suleiman decided to attack Eger. The Siege of Eger proved futile, and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary. Their retention of Eger gave the Austrians good reason to believe that Hungary was still contested ground and that the Ottoman campaign in Hungary had also ended, until its revival in 1566.

The siege of Tokaj in 1565 by the Imperial Army under the command of Lazarus von Schwendi had angered Suleiman. The latter considered Transylvania to be his realm, and did not consider the peace treaty signed between John Sigismund Zápolya and the Holy Roman Empire to be valid.

A peace treaty between the Ottomans and Habsburgs had been negotiated in 1565 after Ferdinand&#x27;s death in 1564. Ottoman officials had sent multiple letters to Emperor Maximilian on the following issues: the payment of tribute, Habsburg infiltration in Ottoman territories, the return of the Ottoman emissary Hidayet Ağa, and the potential invalidity of the 1565 treaty if the Habsburgs did not withdraw their forces from Transylvania. These have been listed as some of the reasons for the Ottoman campaign in Hungary. 

Szigetvár, , its commander, and bandits in the fort&#x27;s vicinity had also been previously infuriating for Suleiman. The Ottomans had already besieged the fort twice in 1555 and 1556. In a letter he had sent to Ferdinand in 1557, he had written &quot;The fortress of Szigetvár... When the &quot;haydud&quot; and robbers make trouble and commit evil acts, they take refuge in this fortress.&quot; Also, in a remark to the diplomat Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq in the year 1562, Suleiman had said: &quot;&#x27;What&#x27;, said he, &#x27;might make us conclude peace, if those who are in charge of Sigeth will disturb it and continue the war?&#x27;&quot;Suleiman had written to John Sigismund on 7 October 1565 that &quot;he would go to war the following spring, if Maximilian did not send an ambassador with suitable assurances of peace&quot;. After the siege of Nagybanya by Schwendi, Suleiman wrote to John Sigismund that he would personally arrive in Hungary with his army by the following spring.

=== Geography ===
Szigetvár was considered important primarily since forces dispatched from there could cut the enemy lines around the Danube river and thus threaten Buda and Ottoman Hungary. The fort had also obstructed Ottoman conquests in Southern Transdanubia because it controlled movement on the Drava river and had also threatened Virovitica and Požega among other Ottoman border forts in the region of Slavonia. 

The fort was surrounded by the Mecsek range which provided natural defense. The usage of canals ensured that the valley around the fort was always inundated with water. Even if a besieger was to break the canals, the dried waterbed around the fort would be muddy and covered with vegetation, thus preventing infantry charges and the deployment of artillery guns near the walls. The fort did not have defensive outworks or a moat, partly because the marshland surrounding the fort was greater in width than most such constructions. Crossing the marshland was a complex task for any besieging army. The Szigetvár fort complex had a total of four forts.

== Logistics and preparation ==

=== Habsburg ===
On 18 August 1565, Emperor Maximilian wrote to his brothers that the Habsburgs would have to be prepared for a war. However, since they had expected the main focus of the Ottoman campaign to be Vienna, they concentrated on the city and had no plans to lift the siege of Szigetvár. Emperor Maximilian and the Habsburg army were thus encamped near Győr but did not lift the siege. 

=== Ottoman ===
For the siege and campaign, soldiers were mobilized from the Hungarian and Balkan provinces administered by the beylerbey of Timișoara. Royal decrees ordering mobilisation were dispatched to multiple beylerbeys in November 1565. The Ottoman government of the Sublime Porte fed wrong information to Habsburg envoys in order to mislead them about the targets and status of the campaign. Suleiman and his army set out for the campaign on 29 April 1566. The historians Szabolcs Varga and Nicolas Vatin both provide a figure of 50,000 for the size of the Ottoman army. The Ottoman chief military engineer for the siege was Ali Portuk. The Ottomans used at least 17 bacaluşka (basilisk guns), majorly of the 14 and 16 oka caliber, during the siege. The chronicler Mustafa Selaniki noted that 180 &quot;–&quot; 280 large guns had been carried along for the siege.

Şeyh Nureddinzade Muslihiddin, a Sufi of the Khalwati order, along with Sokollu Mehmed Pasha had persuaded Sultan Suleiman to participate in the campaign to discharge his obligation of a last jihad. Many beys and mirzas from the Crimean Khanate, including the Kalga (deputy khan) Mehmed II Giray, participated in the campaign. Because of their absence, the khan Devlet I Giray was unable to pledge an oath on &quot;the whole land&quot; to the Tsardom of Russia.

=== Zrinski ===
To enhance the defenses of the fort of Szigetvár, Zrinski had started colleting taxes from multiple areas in the vicinity after he was made the captain general. His initiative led to the fort becoming very large in size, the construction of small forts overlooking important inner roads and the placement of a swamp around the city. Zrinski&#x27;s strategy was to hold the towns and thus not provide an opening for an Ottoman attack on the fort. 

Scholars agree that Zrinski&#x27;s army must have numbered around 2,300 Croatian and Hungarian soldiers, and 2,000 civilians. These troops consisted of his personal forces, and those of his friends and allies, namely Count and the lieutenants Miklouš Kobak, Petar Patačić and Vuk Papratović. Zrinski had sent a letter to the widow of Tamás Nádasdy on 19 April 1566, four months before the siege began, where he said he was going to defend the fort. Zrinski had also written to Maximilian that he would hold Szigetvár long enough that the defenses of Vienna could be strengthened.

==Siege==

The fort&#x27;s defender, Count Nikola IV Zrinski, was one of the largest landholders in the Kingdom of Croatia, a veteran of border warfare, and a Ban (Croatian royal representative) from 1542 to 1556.

Suleiman&#x27;s forces reached Belgrade on 27 June after 49 days of marching through Edirne, Plovdiv and Sofia. They constructed a bridge over the Sava river and arrived in Zemun. Here he met with John II Sigismund Zápolya, whom he had earlier promised to make the ruler of all of Hungary. The Ottoman army arrived in Osijek on 12 July and began crossing the Drava river. According to the historian Kenneth Setton, Suleiman had decided to postpone his attack on Eger after learning of Zrinski&#x27;s success in an attack on a Ottoman encampment at Siklós, and instead attack Zrinski&#x27;s fortress at Szigetvár in order to neutralise him. The historian argues that it was the falling water level of the Drava river which led to the attack against Szigetvár and the postponement of the attack on Eger.

Szigetvár was divided by water into three sections: the old town, the new town, and the castle—each of which was linked to the next by bridges and to the land by causeways. Although it was not built on particularly high ground, the inner castle, which occupied much of the area of today&#x27;s castle, was not directly accessible to the attackers. This was because two other baileys had to be taken and secured before a final assault on the inner castle could be launched.

The Ottoman vanguard arrived near the fort on 1 August 1566. The Ottoman army had surrounded the fort and town by 5 August. Suleiman arrived on 9 August and his war tent was erected on Semlék hill. The Sultan stayed in his camp where he received verbal battle progress reports from Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, his Grand Vizier and the real operational commander of the Ottoman forces.

On 7 August, the preparations for the siege began. Trenches were built, and from behind these lines cannon fire began. The fort&#x27;s palisades were targeted first instead of the walls in order to make the defenders to come out. At night the artillery batteries were put up, and the next day artillery firing on the New Town&#x27;s walls began. The historian József Kelenik argues that only field guns were used for this effort, and that the long-range siege guns were used only to bombard the fort. On 9 August, a battery of five guns began firing at the tower in the inner fort and destroyed its top level, because the tower had afforded full view of the Ottoman movements.Bombardment of the New Town and the inner castle continued on 9 August. Trenches and batteries were constructed in an arc stretching from the southeast rampart. The Old Town was surrounded to the east by janissaries who were closing in on the walls, and to the west by a battery near the dam, while more batteries were built to bombard it. Preliminary work was initiated to break open the dam while guarded by 600 janissaries. The defenders retreated from New Town in the evening after incurring much damage from the bombardment.

On 10 August, the Ottomans initiated a large artillery offensive against the fort. Ottoman artillery began firing on its two southern parapets, meanwhile, the Old Town was fired upon by four or five batteries. Zrinski and his subordinates disagreed on what course to follow next. Zrinski intended to withdraw from the Old Town, but his subordinates wanted to hold onto it. Zrinski decided to keep holding the town because it would provide more time for the defenders and because evacuating 4,000 people from the town to the fort would be tough.

On 19 August, long sections of the Old Town&#x27;s walls had collapsed. The defenders began retreating but were attacked by the Ottomans at the entrance of the fort&#x27;s bridge, and the former lost many of their officers during the fighting. The bulwarks on the southwest and southeast parts of the fort had been under bombardment continuously for ten days, but had not broken, primarily due to the long distance from and constrained angle of fire of the batteries. An additional two batteries were deployed in the Old Town to the south of the fort, where they targeted the weakest and least defensible portions of the bastions. The cross beams of these structures were more vulnerable to bombardment and crumbled quickly.

Zrinski, advised by his experienced commanders, ordered 200 of his cavalry to prevent the Ottomans form draining the swamp surrounding the fort complex. This initiative failed; other ideas advanced by Zrinski&#x27;s subordinates in the first two weeks of the siege also ended in failure. After the demise of his lieutenants and the Ottomans taking the towns, Zrinski commandeered the resistance himself.

The fort&#x27;s walls were partly breached at the Hegy () Bastion, which was the one nearest to the Ottoman cannons. A bigger portion of the walls collapsed six days after the Old Town was taken by the Ottomans. The Ottoman commanders determined that this was the time to mount their first infantry attack. On 26 August, they launched the attack but failed and suffered high losses. The purpose of this attack probably was to expand the breaches they had made by digging through them into the fort walls. On 29 August, the Ottomans initiated another attack to decisively defeat the defenders; however, the attack failed and 4,000 Ottoman soldiers died.

During the following days, the Ottomans suffered great losses due to the spread of dysentery, which also might have infected Sultan Suleiman. The defenders had sent multiple letters to Emperor Maximilian requesting aid and the lifting of the siege, but the Emperor and his army did not move from their camp. The Emperor, till the end of the siege, was tricked by the Sultan and Grand Vizier into believing that the Ottomans&#x27; actual target was Vienna.

After the infantry attacks, the besiegers&#x27; cannons began firing at the Nádasdy Bastion in the northeastern part of the fort. Also, siege embankments were raised against the southwestern and southeastern ramparts. Portuk died during the final phase of the siege. On 2 September, taking advantage of the nighttime darkness, the Ottomans fully breached the walls facing the Hegy Bastion, which had the best cannons in the fort. The janissaries placed inflammable substances in an opening they had mined into the Hegy Bastion. On 5 September, they lit the opening on fire using gunpowder. The fire expanded to the other buildings in the fort, and it could not be put out due to strong winds and the constant bombardment of the bastion&#x27;s vicinity.

Zrinski was at the Nádasdy Bastion and had held out against two attacks there. He retreated to the inner fort, but much of the other troops on the outer fort could not, and the latter was taken by the Ottomans on 5 September. Suleiman had offered Zrinski the opportunity to rule all of Croatia if he surrendered, but Zrinski refused. The fall of the castle appeared inevitable but the Ottoman high command hesitated. On 6 September, Suleiman died in his tent. His death was kept secret with great effort, with only the Sultan&#x27;s innermost circle knowing of his demise. This was because the Ottomans feared that their soldiers would give up the battle if they knew that their leader had died, so his death was kept secret for 48 days. A courier was dispatched from the camp with a message for Suleiman&#x27;s successor, Selim II.

===Final battle===

The final battle began on 7 September, the day after Suleiman&#x27;s demise. The Ottoman army swarmed through the city, drumming and yelling. Zrinski then ordered a charge and led his remaining 600 troops out of the castle. At the bridge of the inner castle, he died from bullets fired by the janissaries.

Before leading the final sortie out of the castle garrison, Zrinski had ordered that the fuse of the powder magazine was to be lit. After cutting down the last of the defenders, the besiegers entered the third fort of the fort complex and fell into the booby trap. The Vizier and his mounted officers had just enough time to escape but 3,000 Ottoman soldiers died due to the explosion.

Almost all of Zrinski&#x27;s garrison died during the siege, while total Ottoman casualties have been estimated at around 20,000–30,000. Zrinski&#x27;s corpse was beheaded, and it was believed that his head was sent by Mehmed Pasha to either Sokullu Mustafa, the Pasha of Budin, or to the new Sultan Selim II. However, Zrinski&#x27;s head had actually been sent by Sokollu Mehmed Pasha to a camp in Győr. There, his son-in-law took it so it could be buried by Zrinski&#x27;s son Juraj IV Zrinski and the noble Ferenc Tahy in September 1566 at the Pauline monastery in Sveta Jelena near Šenkovec, Croatia.

==Aftermath==
The historian argues that cross border raids in Croatia had continued after the siege, and these had led to the Croatian–Slovene Peasant Revolt. Idris Karačović, a servant of Nikola Zrinski, was taken prisoner after the siege and went on to serve as an Ottoman beylerbey, sanjakbey and pasha.

After the battle, the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan&#x27;s name, proclaiming victory. His death meant that any advances in Europe were postponed, as the Grand Vizier had to return to Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan, Selim II. Even if Suleiman had lived, his army could not have achieved much in the short period between the fall of Szigetvár and the onset of winter. The prolonged resistance at Szigetvár delayed the Ottoman push towards Vienna.

Two ambassadors were sent by Emperor Maximilian: the Croatian Antun Vrančić and the Styrian . They arrived in Istanbul on 26 August 1567 and were well received by Sultan Selim II. An agreement ending the war between the Austrian and Ottoman empires was reached on 17 February 1568, after five months of negotiations with Sokollu Mehmed Pasha. The Treaty of Adrianople was signed on 21 February 1568. Sultan Selim II agreed to an eight-year truce, and the agreement brought 25 years of (relative) peace between the Empires until the Long War began between them. The truce was conditional and Maximilian agreed to pay an annual tribute of 30,000 ducats.

==Legacy and accounts==
=== In Europe ===
The siege has been noted as being formative for Hungarian and Croatian national identities. 

A first-hand report by , Zrinski&#x27;s chamberlain and a survivor of the siege, was translated into Latin in 1568, being influential for inspiring epic literature about the siege. The first such work was the &quot;De capto Zygetho historia&quot; (&quot;History of the capture of Sziget&quot;) written by Christian Schesaeus in 1571. Another such work was written by the Croatian Renaissance poet and writer Brne Karnarutić, who wrote &quot;The Conquest of the City of Sziget&quot; (&quot;Vazetje Sigeta grada&quot;) sometime before 1573. The long poem &quot;Pjesma o Sigetu&quot; (&quot;Song on Siget&quot;) from the &quot;Cerkvena pesmarica&quot; (&quot;Church songbook&quot;), written in the Kajkavian dialect of Croatian, is dated to the late 16th or early 17th century.

The battle was also chronicled in the Hungarian epic poem &quot;Szigeti Veszedelem&quot; (&quot;Peril of Sziget&quot;, 1651), written in fifteen parts by Zrinski&#x27;s great-grandson Nicholas VII of Zrin. Petar Zrinski, the brother of Nicholas VII of Zrin, published the &quot;Opsida Sigecka&quot; (&quot;Siege of Siget&quot;) in 1660 in Croatian. Another Croatian poet, Pavao Ritter Vitezović, wrote about the battle in his poem &quot;Odiljenje sigetsko&quot; (&quot;The Sziget Farewell&quot;), first published in 1684. Karl Theodor Körner, a German poet, wrote in 1812 a drama titled &quot;Zriny&quot; about the battle. Ivan Zajc&#x27;s 1876 opera &quot;Nikola Šubić Zrinski&quot; is his most famous and popular work in Croatia.

=== In Turkey ===
Szigetvár is intertwined with Sultan Suleiman in both Ottoman and Turkish memory. The first account of the siege was the &quot;Nüzhet-i Esrarü’l-Ahyar der Ahbar-ı Sefer-i Sigetvar&quot; (&quot;The Pleasant Secrets from the Trip to Sigetvar&quot;)&quot;,&quot; published in 1568 by Feridun Ahmed Bey, who had been present in the Ottoman camp at Szigetvár. Agehi Mansur Çelebi, who had also been a participant in the siege, wrote the &quot;Fetihname-i Kala-i Sigetvar&quot; (&quot;The Conquest of the Castle of Sigetva&quot;r). The &quot;Sigetvar Fetihnamesi&quot; (&quot;Conquest of Sigetvar&quot;), written by Seyfi of Istanbul, is not extant now. Merahi also wrote the &quot;Fetihname-i Sigetvar&quot; (&quot;Conquest of Sigetvar&quot;) about the siege in verse. The poet Aşık Çelebi&#x27;s &quot;Sigetvarname&quot; (&quot;Story of Sigetvar&quot;), Mustafa Selaniki&#x27;s &quot;Tarih-i Selâniki&quot; (&quot;Annals of Selaniki&quot;) and multiple other illustrated &quot;Sigetvarname&quot;s are a few other accounts of the siege.

<text>Karl Derrick &quot;Tuffy&quot; Rhodes (born August 21, 1968) is a retired American professional baseball player. He played six years in Major League Baseball in the US, and thirteen years in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in Japan. Rhodes is the all-time NPB home run leader among foreign-born players, and he is 13th overall with 464 home runs in Japan. He hit 55 home runs in 2001, tying the NPB single-season mark set by Sadaharu Oh in 1964.

==Early life==
Rhodes was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He acquired the nickname &quot;Tuffy&quot; as a child due to his serious approach to baseball. Rhodes attended Western Hills High School in Cincinnati.

==Career==
Prior to Japan, he was a center fielder playing for the Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox from 1990-1995.

In his major league career, Rhodes batted .224, with 13 home runs and 44 runs batted in, 74 runs scored and 14 stolen bases in 225 games played.

In , he hit an extra-inning home run to win the American Association championship for the Iowa Cubs. His only season of more than 250 at bats came with the 1994 Cubs. In that season, Rhodes became the first National League player to hit three home runs on opening day when he connected off Dwight Gooden at Wrigley Field. In this game, Rhodes also became the first major leaguer ever to hit home runs in his first three at-bats of a season.

Granted free agency after the season, Rhodes signed with the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the Pacific League of NPB.

In the season, he hit his 55th homer to tie Sadaharu Oh&#x27;s Japanese League single season home run record, set in . For the rest of the season, opposing pitchers intentionally walked Rhodes to prevent him from breaking Oh&#x27;s record. (The current record is 60, set by Wladimir Balentien in 2013.) The following year, Alex Cabrera tied the record. Over 8 seasons with the Buffaloes, Rhodes hit 288 home runs for the team.

After eight one-year contracts with the Buffaloes, Rhodes wanted a multi-year contract with the team, but they refused to give him his contract. He was planning to sign with the Giants, and he only wanted Kintetsu to match the years, not the contract. He later found out that due to Kintetsu selling the club, they couldn&#x27;t give him his multi year contract.

After Kintetsu refused to sign him to a multi-year contract, Rhodes signed a two-year deal with the Yomiuri Giants of the Japanese Central League in 2004. A successful first year was followed by a difficult second year. He left the team halfway through the 2005 season due to injury, and was released in the off-season.

In 2006, he tried to return to the major leagues with the Cincinnati Reds but was released by the team in spring training. He did not play again that season.

After spending the rest of 2006 with his family, however, he returned to Japan in 2007, signing a one-year contract with the Orix Buffaloes. After 10 seasons in NPB, Rhodes became just the second foreign player to accrue the required service time to no longer be counted as a foreign player for roster purposes, joining Tai-Yuan Kuo. In the past decade, Alex Ramírez and Alex Cabrera have also achieved the same classification.

Rhodes began the 2007 season with a bang by hitting a home run in his first game, and connecting for two more in the next game on two consecutive at bats. According to manager Terry Collins, Rhodes still had an &#x27;explosive&#x27; bat. While the Buffaloes struggled to a last-place finish in 2007, and also not having any protection to speak of in the lineup, Rhodes&#x27; comeback was a spectacular one, batting .291 and hitting 42 home runs to go with 96 runs batted in.

The next season, teamed with fellow foreign-born slugger Alex Cabrera, Rhodes hit 40 home runs and drove in 118 runs. Combined, Cabrera and Rhodes, who earned the nickname &quot;Caburo&quot; late in the season, slammed 76 home runs and drove in 222 runs. Rhodes&#x27; 118 RBI also led the league as the Buffaloes made an improbable run to the playoffs, finishing second in the Pacific League and making their first playoff appearance since their 1996 Japan Series victory. However, the success did not last as the Buffaloes were swept in the short first-round of the Pacific League Climax Series by Yu Darvish and the more experienced Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. Rhodes played for one more season with Orix before retiring for good at the end of the 2009 season.

<doc id="599534" wikidata="Q2631087" url="?curid=599534" title="List of Virtual Boy games">
<text>The Virtual Boy is a 32-bit tabletop video game console developed and designed by Nintendo, first released in Japan on July 21, 1995 and later in North America on August 14 of the same year. The following lists contains all of the games released for the Virtual Boy.

Originally unveiled at Nintendo&#x27;s Shoshinkai Show in Japan on November 15, 1994 and at Winter CES in North America on January 6, 1995, it was never intended to be released in its final form but Nintendo pushed the Virtual Boy in its unfinished state to market so that it could focus development resources on the then-upcoming Nintendo 64 and arrived later than other 32-bit systems such as the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn but at a lower price, retailing at US$179.95 but in mid-1996, Blockbuster was selling Virtual Boy units at $50 each.

The system was overwhelmingly panned by critics and was deemed a commercial failure, selling only 770,000 units before being discontinued both in Japan and North America on and March 2, 1996 respectively, making it the second lowest-selling hardware by Nintendo after the 64DD and its marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure. Several additional titles were announced to be released for the Virtual Boy at E3 1996, but ultimately they were never released due to the system’s discontinuation by Nintendo themselves, as were several localizations that were only released in one region. 

This lists all games commercially released for the Virtual Boy. For games that were announced or in development but never released, see the list of cancelled Virtual Boy games.

==Games==
Listed here are all officially released Virtual Boy games. Of these, eight titles were exclusive to Japan, three to North America and the other 11 were released in both regions. The Americas saw 14 releases and Japan, Hong Kong, and other Asian territories had 19. A number of games were either announced or already in development before ultimately being cancelled including &quot;Bound High!&quot;, &quot;Dragon Hopper&quot;, &quot;NikoChan Battle&quot;, and &quot;Zero Racers&quot;.

<text>Solovyovo (; ), formerly Taipale, is a rural locality (a settlement) in Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located on the western shore of Lake Ladoga on the Karelian Isthmus about north of Saint Petersburg. The settlement is approximately east-southeast of the post-Winter War border with Finland. Vuoksi River&#x27;s southern armlet Burnaya empties into Lake Ladoga at Solovyovo. As of January 1997, its population was 7.

==History==
Taipale, at the Mannerheim Line then approximately from the Finnish–Soviet border, became known for heavy fighting during the Battle of Taipale in December 1939 during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union. The area was held by the Finnish forces until the end of that war, when all of the Karelian Isthmus was ceded to the Soviet Union and had to be evacuated in haste.

<doc id="599540" wikidata="Q223246" url="?curid=599540" title="Image of Edessa">
<text>According to Christian tradition, the Image of Edessa was a holy relic consisting of a square or rectangle of cloth upon which a miraculous image of the face of Jesus Christ had been imprinted—the first icon (). The image is also known as the Mandylion (, &#x27;cloth&#x27; or &#x27;towel&#x27;), in Eastern Orthodoxy, it is also known as Acheiropoieton (, ).

In the tradition recorded in the early 4th century by Eusebius of Caesarea, King Abgar of Edessa wrote to Jesus, asking him to come cure him of an illness. Abgar received a reply letter from Jesus, declining the invitation, but promising a future visit by one of his disciples. One of the seventy disciples, Thaddeus of Edessa, is said to have come to Edessa, bearing the words of Jesus, by the virtues of which the king was miraculously healed.
Eusebius said that he had transcribed and translated the actual letter in the Syriac chancery documents of the king of Edessa, but who makes no mention of an image. The report of an image, which accrued to the legendarium of Abgar, first appears in the Syriac work the &quot;Doctrine of Addai&quot;: according to it, the messenger, here called Ananias, was also a painter, and he painted the portrait, which was brought back to Edessa and conserved in the royal palace.

The first record of the existence of a physical image in the ancient city of Edessa (now Urfa) was by Evagrius Scholasticus, writing about 593, who reports a portrait of Christ of divine origin (θεότευκτος), which effected the miraculous aid in the defence of Edessa against the Persians in 544. The image was moved to Constantinople in the 10th century. The cloth disappeared when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, and is believed by some to have reappeared as a relic in King Louis IX of France&#x27;s Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. This relic disappeared in the French Revolution.

The provenance of the Edessa letter between the 1st century and its location in his own time are not reported by Eusebius. The materials, according to the scholar Robert Eisenman, &quot;are very widespread in the Syriac sources with so many multiple developments and divergences that it is hard to believe they could all be based on Eusebius&#x27; poor efforts&quot;.

The Eastern Orthodox Church observes a feast for this icon on August 16, which commemorates its translation from Edessa to Constantinople.

==History of the legend==

The story of the Mandylion is likely the product of centuries of development. The first version is found in Eusebius&#x27; &quot;History of the Church&quot; (1.13.5–1.13.22). Eusebius claimed that he had transcribed and translated the actual letter in the Syriac chancery documents of the king of Edessa. This records a letter written by King Abgar of Edessa to Jesus, asking him to come cure him of an illness. Jesus replies by letter, saying that when he had completed his earthly mission and ascended to heaven, he would send a disciple (Thaddeus of Edessa) to heal Abgar (and does so). At this stage, there is no mention of an image of Jesus.

In AD 384, Egeria, a pilgrim from either Gaul or Spain, was given a personal tour by the Bishop of Edessa, who provided her with many marvellous accounts of miracles that had saved Edessa from the Persians and put into her hands transcripts of the correspondence of Abgarus and Jesus, with embellishments. Part of her accounts of her travels, in letters to her sisterhood, survive. &quot;She naïvely supposed that this version was more complete than the shorter letter which she had read in a translation at home, presumably one brought back to the Far West by an earlier pilgrim&quot;. Her escorted tour, accompanied by a translator, was thorough; the bishop is quoted: &quot;Now let us go to the gate where the messenger Ananias came in with the letter of which I have been telling you.&quot; There was however, no mention of any image reported by Egeria, who spent three days inspecting every corner of Edessa and the environs.

The next stage of development appears in the &quot;Doctrine of Addai&quot; [Thaddeus], c. 400, which introduces a court painter among a delegation sent by Abgar to Jesus, who paints a portrait of Jesus to take back to his master:

The later legend of the image recounts that because the successors of Abgar reverted to paganism, the bishop placed the miraculous image inside a wall, and setting a burning lamp before the image, he sealed them up behind a tile; that the image was later found again, after a vision, on the very night of the Persian invasion, and that not only had it miraculously reproduced itself on the tile, but the same lamp was still burning before it; further, that the bishop of Edessa used a fire into which oil flowing from the image was poured to destroy the Persians.

The image itself is said to have resurfaced in 525, during a flood of the Daisan, a tributary stream of the Euphrates that passed by Edessa. This flood is mentioned in the writings of the court historian Procopius of Caesarea. In the course of the reconstruction work, a cloth bearing the facial features of a man was discovered hidden in the wall above one of the gates of Edessa.

Writing soon after the Persian siege of 544, Procopius says that the text of Jesus&#x27; letter, by then including a promise that &quot;no enemy would ever enter the city&quot;, was inscribed over the city gate, but does not mention an image. Procopius is sceptical about the authenticity of the promise, but says that the wish to disprove it was part of the Persian king Khosrau I&#x27;s motivation for the attack, as &quot;it kept irritating his mind&quot;. The Syriac &quot;Chronicle of Edessa&quot; written in 540-550 also claim divine interventions in the siege, but does not mention the Image.

Some fifty years later, Evagrius Scholasticus in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; (593) is the first to mention a role for the image in the relief of the siege, attributing it to a &quot;God-made image&quot;, a miraculous imprint of the face of Jesus upon a cloth. Thus we can trace the development of the legend from a letter, but no image in Eusebius, to an image painted by a court painter in Addai, which becomes a miracle caused by a miraculously-created image supernaturally made when Jesus pressed a cloth to his wet face in Evagrius. It was this last and latest stage of the legend that became accepted in Eastern Orthodoxy, the image of Edessa that was &quot;created by God, and not produced by the hands of man&quot;. This idea of an icon that was &quot;Acheiropoietos&quot; (, ) is a separate enrichment of the original legend: similar legends of supernatural origins have accrued to other Orthodox icons.

The Ancha icon is reputed to be the &quot;Keramidion&quot;, another &quot;acheiropoietos&quot; recorded from an early period, miraculously imprinted with the face of Christ by contact with the Mandylion. To art historians it is a Georgian icon of the 6th-7th century.

According to the &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, which is a collection of hagiographies compiled by Jacobus de Voragine in the thirteenth century, the king Abgarus sent an epistle to Jesus, who answered him writing that he would send him one of his disciples (Thaddeus of Edessa) to heal him. The same work adds:

==Later events==
The &quot;Holy Mandylion&quot; disappeared again after the Sassanians conquered Edessa in 609. A local legend, related to historian Andrew Palmer when he visited Urfa (Edessa) in 1997, relates that the towel or burial cloth ( ) of Jesus was thrown into a well in what is today the city&#x27;s Great Mosque. The Christian tradition exemplified in Georgios Kedrenos&#x27; &quot;Historiarum compendium&quot; is at variance with this, John Scylitzes recounting how in 944, when the city was besieged by John Kourkouas, it was exchanged for a group of Muslim prisoners. At that time the Image of Edessa was taken to Constantinople where it was received amidst great celebration by emperor Romanos I Lekapenos, who deposited it in the Theotokos of the Pharos chapel in the Great Palace of Constantinople. Not inconsequentially, the earliest known Byzantine icon of the Mandylion or Holy Face, preserved at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in Egypt, is dated c. 945.

The Mandylion remained under Imperial protection until the Crusaders sacked the city in 1204 and carried off many of its treasures to Western Europe, though the &quot;Image of Edessa&quot; is not mentioned in this context in any contemporary document. Similarly, it has been claimed that the Shroud of Turin disappeared from Constantinople in 1204, when Crusaders looted the city. The leaders of the Crusader army in this instance were French and Italian (from Venice), and it is believed that somehow because of this, the Shroud made its way to France. A small part of a relic, believed to be the same as this, was one of the large group sold by Baldwin II of Constantinople to Louis IX of France in 1241 and housed in the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris (not to be confused with the Sainte Chapelle at Chambéry, home for a time of the Shroud of Turin) until it disappeared during the French Revolution.

The Portuguese Jesuit Jerónimo Lobo, who visited Rome in 1637, mentions the sacred portrait sent to King Abgar as being in this city: &quot;I saw the famous relics that are preserved in that city as in a sanctuary, a large part of the holy cross, pieces of the crown and several thorns, the sponge, the lance, Saint Thomas&#x27;s finger, one of the thirty coins for which the Saviour was sold, the sacred portrait, the one that Christ Our Lord sent to King Abagaro, the sacred staircase on which Christ went up and down from the Praetorium, the head of the holy Baptist, the Column, the Altar on which Saint Peter said mass, and countless other relics.&quot;

==Surviving images==
Three images survive today which are associated with the Mandylion.

Author Ian Wilson has argued that the object venerated as the Mandylion from the 6th to the 13th centuries was in fact the Shroud of Turin, folded in four, and enclosed in an oblong frame so that only the face was visible. Wilson cites documents in the Vatican Library and the University of Leiden, Netherlands, which seem to suggest the presence of another image at Edessa. A 10th-century codex, &quot;Codex Vossianus Latinus&quot; Q 69, found by Gino Zaninotto in the Vatican Library, contains an 8th-century account saying that an imprint of Christ&#x27;s whole body was left on a canvas kept in a church in Edessa: it quotes a man called Smera in Constantinople: &quot;King Abgar received a cloth on which one can see not only a face but the whole body&quot; ().

===Holy Face of Genoa===
This image is kept in the Church of St Bartholomew of The Armenians in Genoa, Italy. In the 14th century it was donated to the doge of Genoa Leonardo Montaldo by the Byzantine Emperor John V Palaeologus.

It has been the subject of a detailed 1969 study by Colette Dufour Bozzo, who dated the outer frame to the late 14th century, giving a terminus ante quem for the inner frame and the image itself. Bozzo found that the image was imprinted on a cloth that had been pasted onto a wooden board.

The similarity of the image with the Veil of Veronica suggests a link between the two traditions.

===Holy Face of San Silvestro===
This image was kept in Rome&#x27;s church of San Silvestro in Capite, attached to a convent of Poor Clares, up to 1870, and is now kept in the Matilda chapel in the Vatican Palace. It is housed in a Baroque frame added by Sister Dionora Chiarucci, head of the convent, in 1623. The earliest evidence of its existence is 1517, when the nuns were forbidden to exhibit it to avoid competition with the Veronica. Like the Genoa image, it is painted on board and therefore is likely to be a copy. It was exhibited at Germany&#x27;s Expo 2000 in the pavilion of the Holy See.

==Veil of Veronica==

Historian Rebecca Rist says that devotion to Saint Veronica was encouraged by Pope Innocent III in part to compete with Constantinople&#x27;s Mandylion and increase the prestige of Rome and its pope by claiming a similar acheiropoieta, the Veil of Veronica.

In later Western European tradition the main likeness of the face of Jesus not made by human hand (i.e., an acheiropoieton), became the Veil of Veronica, supposedly the cloth offered by Saint Veronica to Jesus so he could wipe his face on the way to his crucifixion. That the name &quot;Veronica&quot; may derive from &quot;true image&quot; (alternatively &quot;pherenike&quot; (&quot;bearer of blessing&quot; in Greek), and the late appearance of this legend, has increased the scepticism of scholars. A cloth believed to exist today in the Vatican is supposed to have been brought back to Italy at the time of the Crusades. The Veil of Veronica (, &#x27;sweat-cloth&#x27;), often called simply &quot;The Veronica&quot; and known in Italian as the Volto Santo or Holy Face (but not to be confused with the carved crucifix the Volto Santo of Lucca), is a Christian relic of a piece of cloth which, according to tradition, bears the image of Jesus&#x27; face. Various existing images have been claimed to be the &quot;original&quot; relic, or early copies of it.

Accounts of the Veil of Veronica and the Image of Edessa are sometimes confused by scholars.

<doc id="599543" wikidata="Q11883242" url="?curid=599543" title="Moro Rebellion">
<text>The Moro Rebellion (1902–1913) was an armed conflict between the Moro people and the United States military during the Philippine–American War. The rebellion occurred after the conclusion of the conflict between the United States and First Philippine Republic, and saw the US move to impose its authority over the Muslim states in Mindanao, Jolo and the neighboring Sulu Archipelago.

==Background==
The Moros have a 400-year history of resisting foreign rule. The violent armed struggle against the Spanish, against the Americans, against the Japanese, and against the Filipinos, is considered by current Moro leaders as part of the four centuries-long &quot;national liberation movement&quot; of the Bangsamoro (Moro Nation). This conflict persisted and developed into their current war for independence against the Philippine state. A &quot;culture of jihad&quot; emerged among the Moros due to the centuries-long war against the Spanish invaders.

The ethnic Moro population of the southern Philippines resisted both Spanish and American colonization. The Moro areas of Western Mindanao have been the most rebellious areas in the Philippines along with Samar and the Bicol Region. The Spaniards were restricted to a handful of coastal garrisons or forts and they made occasional punitive expeditions into the vast interior regions. After a series of unsuccessful attempts during the centuries of Spanish rule in the Philippines, Spanish forces occupied the abandoned city of Jolo, Sulu, the seat of the Sultan of Sulu, in 1876. The Spaniards and the Sultan of Sulu signed the Spanish Treaty of Peace on July 22, 1878. Control of the Sulu archipelago outside of the Spanish garrisons was handed to the Sultan. The treaty had translation errors: According to the Spanish-language version, Spain had complete sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago, while the Tausug version described a protectorate instead of an outright dependency. Despite the very nominal claim to the Moro territories, Spain ceded them to the United States in the Treaty of Paris which signaled the end of the Spanish–American War.

Following the American occupation of the Northern Philippines during 1899, Spanish forces in the Southern Philippines were abolished, and they retreated to the garrisons at Zamboanga and Jolo. American forces took control over the Spanish government in Jolo on May 18, 1899, and at Zamboanga in December 1899.

==Cause of the war==
After the American government informed the Moros that they would continue the old colonial protectorate relationship that they had with Spain, the Moro Sulu Sultan rejected this and demanded that a new treaty be negotiated. The United States signed the Kiram–Bates Treaty with the Moro Sulu Sultanate which guaranteed the Sultanate&#x27;s autonomy in its internal affairs and governance if they stayed out of the Philippine–American War. This allowed Brigadier General John C. Bates to concentrate his forces on repressing the Filipino resistance in Luzon. Once the Americans defeated the northern Filipinos, the treaty with the Moros was canceled by Bates, the sultan was betrayed, and the Americans invaded Moroland.

After the war in 1915, the Americans imposed the Carpenter Treaty on Sulu.

==Philippine–American War events (1899–1902)==
First Republic forces in the southern Philippines were commanded by General Nicolas Capistrano, and American forces conducted an expedition against him in the winter of 1900–1901. On March 27, 1901, Capistrano surrendered. General Emilio Aguinaldo had been captured a few days earlier captured in Luzon. This major victory in the war in the north allowed the Americans to devote more resources to the south, and they began to push into Moroland.

On August 31, 1901, Brigadier General George Whitefield Davis replaced Kobbe as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. Davis adopted a conciliatory policy towards the Moros. American forces under his command had standing orders to buy Moro produce when possible and to have &quot;heralds of amity&quot; precede all scouting expeditions. Peaceful Moros would not be disarmed. Polite reminders of America&#x27;s anti-slavery policy were allowed.

One of Davis&#x27; subordinates, Captain John J. Pershing, assigned to the American garrison at Iligan, set out to better relations with the Moros of the Maranao tribes on the northern shore of Lake Lanao. He successfully established friendly relations with Amai-Manabilang, the retired Sultan of Madaya. Although retired, Manabilang was the single most influential personage among the fragmented inhabitants of the northern shore of the lake. His alliance did much to secure American standing in the area.

Not all of Davis&#x27; subordinates were as diplomatic as Pershing. Many veterans of the American Indian Wars took the &quot;only good Indian is a dead Indian&quot; mentality with them to the Philippines, and &quot;civilize &#x27;em with a Krag&quot; became a similar catchphrase.

==Conflict==

In March of 1902, relations between American troops and the Moros seemed to be good. However, on March 9, an American soldier was killed by unidentified assailants. outside the port of Parang. Three days later, an 18-man cavalry detachment in the same area was ambushed by Moros and one of their number killed. On March 30, another American was hacked to death by Moros outside the nearby port of Malabang.

These ambushes of American troops by Moros, one of which involved juramentados, occurred to the south of Lake Lanao, outside of Manabilang&#x27;s sphere of influence. These events prompted Major General Adna Chaffee, then the military governor of the Philippines, to issue a declaration on April 13, 1902. The declaration began, &quot;Under the Treaty of Paris between Spain and the United States, ... the Philippine Islands, including the island of Mindanao, were ceded by Spain to the United States.&quot;, and demanded that the killers of American troops and stolen government property be handed over to the United States. Chafee&#x27;s declaration was an attempt at a peaceful resolution. However the Moros, had never heard of Paris and considered that Spain, which had never successfully conquered Mindanao, could not cede their land to anyone. They considered Chaffee&#x27;s declaration arrogant and rejected his demands.

The Americans, unaware of a long history of internecine Moro feuding which could have moved one Moro group to attack American troops friendly with another group, sent an intermediary to open talks with a local group. Also unknown to the Americans, the leader of that group had a personal dislike of the intermediary. The intermediary was told that Americans were intent on proselytizing the Moros away from Islam and taking their lands. The Americans viewed this as defiance.

The Moros being not compliant, a punitive expedition under Colonel Frank Baldwin set out to settle matters with the south-shore Moros. Although an excellent officer, Baldwin was &quot;eager&quot;, and a worried Davis joined the expedition as an observer. On May 2, 1902, Baldwin&#x27;s expedition attacked a Moro cotta (fortress) at the Battle of Pandapatan, also known as the Battle of Bayan. Pandapatan&#x27;s defenses were unexpectedly strong, leading to 18 American casualties during the fighting. On the second day, the Americans used ladders and moat-bridging tools to break through the Moro fortifications, and a general slaughter of the Moro defenders followed.

The expeditionary force built in Camp Vickers one mile south of Pandapatan, and Davis assigned Pershing to Baldwin&#x27;s command as an intelligence officer and as director of Moro affairs. As director, &#x27;Black Jack&#x27; Pershing had a veto over Baldwin&#x27;s movements, which was an unstable arrangement. This arrangement was tested when survivors of Pandapatan began building a Cotta at Bacolod. Baldwin wanted to move on the hostile Moros immediately, but Pershing warned that doing so could create an anti-American coalition of the surrounding Datus, while some patient diplomacy could establish friendly relations with most of the Moros, isolating the hostile minority. Baldwin grudgingly agreed. On June 30, Pershing assumed command of Camp Vickers, and Baldwin returned to Malabang. A command the size of Camp Vickers would normally have gone to an officer with the rank of major, and a careful shuffling of personnel would be required to ensure that reinforcements to the Camp did not include officers that were senior to Pershing.

On July 4, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt issued a proclamation declaring an end to the Philippine Insurrection and a cessation of hostilities in the Philippines &quot;except in the country inhabited by the Moro tribes, to which this proclamation does not apply.&quot; Later that month, Davis was promoted and replaced Chaffee as the supreme commander of American forces in the Philippines. Command of the Mindanao-Jolo Department went to Brigadier General Samuel S. Sumner. Meanwhile, Pershing settled down to conduct diplomacy with the surrounding Moros, and a July 4 celebration had 700 guests from neighboring rancherias. In September 1902, he led the Masiu Expedition, which resulted in a victory that did much to establish American dominance in the area. On February 10, 1903, Pershing was declared a Datu by the formerly hostile Pandita Sajiduciaman of the Bayan Moros (who had been defeated at the Battle of Pandapatan)the only American to be so honored. Pershing&#x27;s career at Camp Vickers culminated in the march around Lake Lanao during April and May 1903. Dansalan also known as the Marawi Expedition, it included the Battle of Bacolod and First Battle of Taraka but was otherwise peaceful. This expedition quickly became a symbol of American control of the Lake Lanao region and was regarded with dismay by the Moro Maranao inhabitants of that region.

While Pershing was working to the south of Lake Lanao, Major Robert Lee Bullard was working to the north, building a road from Iligan to Marawi. Although never officially declared one, like Pershing, he was regarded as a Datu by the Moros. Because of the Lake Lanao Moros&#x27; very personalistic style of leadership, they had troubles seeing them as two officers in the same army. Instead, they saw them as two powerful chieftains who might become rivals. During Pershing&#x27;s March Around Lake Lanao, one Moro ran to Bullard, exclaiming that Pershing had gone Juramentado, meaning berserk and that Bullard had better run up the white flag (signaling that they had no quarrel with Pershing&#x27;s troops). Bullard was unable to explain to the Moro why he was not worried about Pershing&#x27;s approach. On another occasion, a powerful datu proposed an alliance with Bullard, for the purposes of defeating Pershing and establishing overlordship over the entire Lake Lanao region. On June 1, 1903, the Moro Province was created, which included &quot;all of the territory of the Philippines lying south of the eight parallel of latitude, excepting the island of Palawan and the eastern portion of the northwest peninsula of Mindanao.&quot; The province had a civil government, but many civil service positions, including the district governors and their deputies, were held by members of the American military. The governor of the province served as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. This system of combined civil and military administration had several motivations behind it. One was the continued Moro hostilities. Another was the Army&#x27;s experience during the Indian Wars when it came into conflict with the civilian Bureau of Indian Affairs. A third was that the Moros, with their feudal, personalistic style of government, would have no respect for a military leader who submitted to the authority of a non-combatant.

In addition to the executive branch, under the governor, the province also had a legislative branch: the Moro Council. This Council &quot;consisted of the governor, a state attorney, a secretary, a treasurer, a superintendent of schools, and an engineer.&quot; Although the governor appointed all of the other members of the council, this body was permanent and provided a more solid foundation for laws than the fiats of the governor, which might be overturned by his successor.

The province was divided into five districts, with American officers serving as district governors and deputy governors. These districts included: Cotabato, Davao, Lanao, Sulu, and Zamboanga. The districts were sub-divided into tribal wards, with major datus serving as ward chiefs and minor datus serving as deputies, judges, and sheriffs. This system took advantage of the existing structure of Moro political society, which was based on personal ties while paving the way for a more individualistic society, where the office, not the person holding it, would be given respect.

On August 6, 1903, Major General Leonard Wood assumed his position as the governor of Moro Province and commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. Wood was somewhat heavy-handed in his dealing with the Moros, being &quot;personally offended by the Moro propensity for blood feuds, polygamy, and human trafficking&quot; and with his &quot;ethnocentrism sometimes [leading] him to impose American concepts too quickly in Moroland.&quot; In addition to his views of the Moros, Wood also faced an uphill Senate battle over his appointment to the rank of major general, which was finally confirmed on March 19, 1904. This drove him to seek military laurels in order to shore up his lack of field experience, sometimes leading the Provincial army on punitive expeditions over minor incidents that would have been better handled diplomatically by the district governors. The period of Wood&#x27;s governorship had the hardest and bloodiest fighting of America&#x27;s occupation of Moroland.

Some of the Moros fighting against the American troops were women who dressed exactly the same as men. This led to the song sung by American troops called &quot;If a Lady&#x27;s Wearin&#x27; Pantaloons&quot;.

===Province under Leonard Wood (1903–1906)===
Wood instituted many changes during his tenure as governor of Moro Province:
* On Wood&#x27;s recommendation, the United States unilaterally abrogated the Kiram–Bates Treaty, citing continuing piracy and attacks on American personnel. The Sultan of Sulu was demoted to a purely religious office, with no more power than any other datu, and was provided with a small salary. The United States assumed direct control over Moroland.
* Slavery was abolished. Slave trading and raiding were repressed, but slaves were left with their owners. Wood announced that slaves were &quot;at liberty to go and build homes for themselves wherever they like[d],&quot; and pledged the military&#x27;s protection for any former slaves that did so. Similar actions had been taken by individual commanders in the past, but Wood&#x27;s edict had the backing of the Moro Council, giving it more permanent weight.
* The Cedula Act of 1903 created an annual registration poll tax. This registration poll tax was highly unpopular with the Moros, since they interpreted it as a form of tribute. According to Hurley, participation in the Cedula was very low as late as 1933.
* The legal code of Moroland was reformed. Disputes between Moros and non-Christians had been left to Moro laws and customs, with Philippine laws only applying to disputes with Christians. This led to a double standard, with a Moro who killed a Christian facing a stiff prison sentence, but with a Moro who killed another Moro facing only a maximum fine of 150 pesos. Wood attempted to codify Moro law, but there was simply too much variance in laws and customs between the different tribes and even between neighboring cottas. Wood placed the Moros underneath the Philippine criminal code, but actual enforcement of this proved difficult.
* Private land ownership was introduced, in order to help the Moros transition to a more individualistic society from their traditional tribal society. Each family was given 40 acres (16 ha) of land, with datus given additional land in accordance with their status. Land sales had to be approved by the district governments in order to prevent fraud.
* An educational system was established. By June 1904, there were 50 schools with an average enrollment of 30 students each. Because of difficulties in getting teachers that spoke native languages, classes were conducted in English after initial training in that language. Many Moros were suspicious of the schools, but some offered buildings for use as schools.
* Trade was encouraged in order to give the Moros an alternative to fighting. Trade had been discouraged by banditry, piracy, and the possibility of intertribal disputes between Moro merchants and local customers. When trading with foreign merchants (usually maritime Chinese), a lack of warehousing made for a buyer&#x27;s market, leading to low prices. Wood handled banditry and piracy by establishing military posts at river mouths in order to protect sea and land routes. Starting with a pilot project in Zamboanga, a system of Moro Exchanges was established. These exchanges provided Moro traders with warehouses and temporary housing in exchange for honoring a ban on fighting within the exchange. Bulletin-boards listed market prices in Hong Kong and Singapore, and the district governments guaranteed fair prices. These Exchanges proved highly successful and profitable, and provided a neutral ground for feuding datus to settle their differences.

====Campaigns====
Major military campaigns during Wood&#x27;s governorship include:
* Wood&#x27;s march around Lake Lanao during the fall of 1903 was an abortive attempt to replicate Pershing&#x27;s earlier March.
* In October and November 1903, Wood personally led the Provincial Army to put down the Hassan uprising, which was led by the most powerful datu on the island of Jolo.
* In the spring of 1904, Wood destroyed or captured 130 cottas during the Battle of Taraca.
* Beginning in the spring of 1904 and continuing into the fall of 1905, American forces conducted a lengthy and massive manhunt for Datu Ali, the overlord of Cottabato Valley. Datu Ali had rebelled over Wood&#x27;s anti-slavery policy. Engagements during this campaign include the Battle of Siranaya, the Simpetan massacre, and the Battle of the Malalag River.
* The First Battle of Bud Dajo was fought from March 5 to 7, 1906. An estimated 600 Muslims were killed, fighting a force of 800 Americans.

The &quot;Incident in the Philippines&quot; written by Mark Twain condemned the American massacre at Bud Dajo.

The American general Leonard Wood responsible for the massacre of 900 Moro children, women and men at Bud Dajo was congratulated for his actions by US President Theodore Roosevelt who said &quot;I congratulate you and the officers and men of your command upon the brilliant feat of arms, wherein you and they so well upheld the honor of the American flag.&quot; After being hit with dozens of rifle and pistol bullets, Moros continued to fight and kill US soldiers with their bladed weapons. The Moros&#x27; tenacity led to the creation of the Colt M1911 pistol, which fires .45 caliber cartridges.

===Governorship of Tasker H. Bliss (1906–1909)===
On February 1, 1906, Brigadier General Tasker H. Bliss replaced General Wood as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo, and replaced him as governor of Moro Province sometime after the First Battle of Bud Dajo. Bliss&#x27; tenure is regarded as a &quot;peace era&quot;, and Bliss launched no punitive expeditions during his term in office. However, this superficial peace came at the price of tolerating a certain amount of lawlessness. Constabulary forces in pursuit of Moro fugitives often found themselves forced to abandon their chase after the fugitives took refuge at their home cottas. The constabulary forces were outnumbered, and a much larger (and disruptive) expedition would have been required to dislodge the fugitives from their hiding place. However, this period also demonstrated the success of new aggressive American tactics. According to Rear Admiral D. P. Mannix, who fought the Moros as a young lieutenant from 1907 to 1908, the Americans exploited Muslim taboos by wrapping dead Moros in pig&#x27;s skin and &quot;stuffing [their] mouth[s] with pork&quot;, thereby deterring the Moros from continuing with their suicide attacks.

===Governorship of John J. Pershing (1909–1913)===
On November 11, 1909, Brigadier General John J. Pershing assumed his duties as the third and final military governor of Moro Province.

====Reforms====
Pershing enacted the following reforms during his tenure as governor:
* In order to extend rule of law into the interior, Pershing stationed the Philippine Scouts in small detachments throughout the interior. This reduced crime and promoted agriculture and trade, at the cost of reduced military efficiency and troop training. The benefits of this reform outweighed the costs.
* The legal system was streamlined. Previously, trials had started with the Court of First Instance, which convened every six months, and appeals to the Supreme Court in Manila often took more than one year. Pershing expanded the jurisdiction of the local ward courts, which were presided over by the district governors and secretaries, to include most civil cases and all criminal cases except for capital offenses. The Court of First Instance became the court of last resort. This reform was popular with the Moros, since it was quick, simple, and resembled their traditional unification of executive and judicial powers.
* Pershing promised to donate government land for purposes of building Muslim houses of worship.
* Pershing recognized the practice of sacopy – indentured servitude in exchange for support and protection – as legitimate, but reaffirmed the government&#x27;s opposition to involuntary slavery.
* Labor contract law was reformed in 1912. Defaults on contracts by workers or employers were no longer punishable unless there was intent to defraud or injure. Moros, unused to Western notions of work, were prone to absenteeism, which could lead to breach of contract suits.
* The economy of Moro Province continued to expand under Pershing. The three most important exports – hemp, copra, and lumber – increased 163% during his first three years, and Moros began to make bank deposits for the first time in their history.
* The Moro Exchange system was retained and was supplemented by Industrial Trading Stations. These stations operated in the interior, where merchants seldom went, and bought any non-perishable goods the Moros wished to sell. The stations also sold goods to the Moros at fair prices, preventing price gouging during famines.

====Tactics====
Pershing wrote the following in his autobiography about the &quot;juramentados&quot;:

[The] juramentado attacks were materially reduced in number by a practice the army had already adopted, one that the Mohammadans held in abhorrence. The bodies were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.

Though this treatment was inflicted on captured &quot;juramentados&quot;, historians do not believe that Pershing was directly involved with such incidents, or that he personally gave such orders to his subordinates. Letters and memoirs from soldiers describing events similar to this do not have credible evidence of Pershing&#x27;s having been personally involved. However, some reports do say that Pershing was engaged in deliberate efforts to offend Muslim Filipinos&#x27; religious sensibilities, including an incident in which Pershing brought a pig&#x27;s head to a ceasefire negotiation with a Muslim leader, though there is no evidence for the claim made by Donald Trump that Pershing executed Muslim insurgents with bullets dipped in pig&#x27;s blood.

===Surrender of arms===
Law enforcement in the Moro Province was difficult. Outlaws would go to ground at their home cottas, requiring an entire troop of police or soldiers to arrest them. There was always the danger of a full-fledged battle breaking out during such an arrest, and this led to many known outlaws going unpunished. In 1911, Pershing resolved to disarm the Moros. Army Chief of Staff Leonard Wood (former Moro Province governor) disagreed with this plan, stating that the move was ill-timed and that the Moros would hide their best arms, turning in only their worst. Pershing waited until roads into the interior had been completed, so that government troops could protect disarmed Moros from holdouts. He conferred with the Datus, who mostly agreed that disarmament would be a good idea – provided that &quot;everybody&quot; disarmed.

Six weeks before putting his disarmament plan into action, Pershing informed Governor-General William Cameron Forbes, who agreed with the plan. Pershing did not consult or inform his commanding officer, Major General J. Franklin Bell. On September 8, 1911, Executive Order No. 24, which ordered the disarmament, was issued. The deadline for disarmament was December 1, 1911.

Resistance to disarmament was particularly fierce in the district of Jolo and led to the Second Battle of Bud Dajo (which, while involving roughly equivalent forces as the first battle, was far less bloody causing only 12 Moro casualties), and the Battle of Bud Bagsak. The latter battle, fought from June 11–15 1913, was the last major battle of the conflict, and is usually considered as marking the end of the rebellion. Smaller skirmishes between Moro bands and US troops were reported to have occurred in the months following the battle, with the last of these clashes occurring in Talipao in October 1913.

===Transition to civil authority===
By 1913, Pershing agreed that the Moro Province needed to transition to civil government. This was prompted by the Moro&#x27;s personalistic approach to government, which was based on personal ties rather than a respect for an abstract office. To the Moros, a change of administration meant not just a change in leadership but a change in regime, and was a traumatic experience. Rotation within the military meant that each military governor could serve only for a limited time, and civil governors were needed in order to provide for a lengthy tenure in office. Until 1911, every district governor and secretary had been a military officer. By 1913, Pershing was the only military officer to hold a civil office.

In October 1913, Francis Burton Harrison was appointed Governor-General of the Philippines, and relieved Pershing of his position as governor of the Moro Province, replacing him with Frank Carpenter, a civilian official. In March 1915, Carpenter came to an agreement with Sultan Jamalul Kiram, in which Kiram agreed to relinquish all claims of political power over territories within the Philippines, resulting in the dissolution of the Sulu Sultanate and the United States now having complete, uncontested control over the Philippine Islands.

==Casualties==
During the Moro Rebellion, the Americans suffered losses amounting to 130 killed and 323 wounded. Another 500 or so died of disease. The Philippine Scouts who augmented American forces during the campaign suffered 116 killed and 189 wounded. The Philippine Constabulary suffered heavily as well with more than 1,500 losses sustained of which half were fatalities.

On the Moro side, casualties were high as surrender was uncommon when Moros were engaged in combat.

Tausug fighters used improvised firearms, bows, spears, and barong or kalis swords against US troops with pistols, bolt-action Krag–Jørgensen and M1903 Springfield rifles, pump-action shotguns, Maxim machine guns, and mountain artillery.

==Juramentados and stopping power==
In the Moro Rebellion, the Tausug Moro Muslim juramentados in suicide attacks continued to charge against American soldiers even after being shot. Panglima Hassan in the Hassan uprising was shot dozens of times before he was killed, however, other accounts suggest that he survived and was cared for by his relative, Panglima Bandahala ibn Sattiya Munoh, a trusted adviser and close family member of the Sultan. As a result, Americans elected to phase out the .38 caliber Colt M1892 revolver in favor of .45 caliber sidearms to continue their fight against the Moros. This led to a re-issuing of old .45 Colt M1873 Peacemaker revolvers and later the issuance of the M1909 revolver, essentially an M1892 rechambered in .45 Colt (which would later again be rechambered in the weaker .45 ACP as the M1917). This contributed to the development and adoption of the .45 ACP M1911 semi-automatic pistol on March 29, 1911, after further weapon testing during the rebellion, beginning over 70 years of service by the pistol and cartridge in the US military. 

Arrows, bayonets, guns, and kalises were used in often suicidal attacks by the Moros during their war with the Americans. Suicide attacks became more popular among Moros due to the overwhelming firepower of the Americans in conventional battles. Moro women took part in the resistance at the Battle of Bud Dajo against Major General Lenard Wood in 1906. Barbed wire proved to be of no impediment since Moro juramentado warriors managed to surge directly through it even as it ripped at their flesh and even as they were shot repeatedly with bullets. The Moros used barongs to inflict injuries upon American soldiers. Moros under Jikiri managed to survive in a cave under machine gun fire and Colt gunfire. Kalises and kampilans were used by Moros in fierce close-quarters combat against the Americans. Muskets were also used by the Moros. The Moros employed bayonets at close range when shooting was not possible according to the American journal &quot;The Field Artillery Journal, Volume 32&quot;. Americans were even charged at by Moros using spears. Moros fought to the death against Americans armed with rifles and artillery while they themselves used only kalises at the crater battle.

Novels have been written describing juramentados deliberately impaling themselves on their bayonets in attempts to reach and kill American soldiers.

==Ottoman Empire&#x27;s role==
John Hay, the American Secretary of State, asked the ambassador to Ottoman Empire, Oscar Straus in 1899 to approach Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to request that the Sultan write a letter to the Moro Sulu Muslims of the Sulu Sultanate in the Philippines telling them to submit to American suzerainty and American military rule. Despite the sultan&#x27;s &quot;pan-Islamic&quot; ideology, he readily aided the American forces because he felt no need to cause hostilities between the West and Muslims.

Abdul Hamid wrote the letter, which was sent to Mecca where two Sulu chiefs brought it home to Sulu. It was successful, and the &quot;Sulu Mohammedans ... refused to join the insurrectionists and had placed themselves under the control of [the American] army, thereby recognizing American sovereignty.&quot; John P. Finley wrote that:After due consideration of these facts, the Sultan, as Caliph caused a message to be sent to the Mohammedans of the Philippine Islands forbidding them to enter into any hostilities against the Americans, inasmuch as no interference with their religion would be allowed under American rule. As the Moros have never asked more than that, it is not surprising, that they refused all overtures made, by Aguinaldo&#x27;s agents, at the time of the Filipino insurrection. President McKinley sent a personal letter of thanks to Mr. Straus for the excellent work he had done, and said, its accomplishment had saved the United States at least twenty thousand troops in the field. If the reader will pause to consider what this means in men and also the millions in money, he will appreciate this wonderful piece of diplomacy, in averting a holy war.President William McKinley did not mention the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s role in the pacification of the Sulu Moros in his address to the first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress in December 1899 since the agreement with the Sultan of Sulu was not submitted to the Senate until December 18.

==In popular culture==
* Vic Hurley&#x27;s history of the Moros, &quot;Swish of the Kris The Story of the Moros&quot; tells the story of Colonel Alexander Rodgers using pigs to subdue the Moros in the Philippines. Hurley wrote that Rodgers was known as &quot;the Pig&quot; to the Moros. And another Hurley book &quot;The Jungle Patrol: The Story of the Philippine Constabulary&quot; also relates the story of pigs being used against them.
* Hurley wrote the screenplay for the Hollywood film &quot;The Real Glory&quot; in 1937; the film was released in 1939. It was based on a 1937 novel of the same name by Charles L. Clifford, a pen name of Hurley&#x27;s. The film served as American military propaganda, portraying the US Army as brave defenders of the local population being terrorised by the Moros, whom the film depicts as bloodthirsty raiders oppressing the local Christian Filipino community. The film showed one Moro &quot;juramentado&quot; causing 60 Filipino soldiers to cower in fear, which was protested by Philippine President Manuel Quezon. In one scene of the movie, Gary Cooper as Dr. Bill Canavan threatens to bury a captive Moro in a pigskin so to prevent the Moro from entering paradise upon death; this scene was censored from the movie during World War II due to the Moros being US allies against the Japanese.

<text>Michael Bernard Bloomfield (July 28, 1943 – February 15, 1981) was an American blues guitarist and composer. Born in Chicago, he became one of the first popular music stars of the 1960s to earn his reputation almost entirely on his instrumental prowess, as he rarely sang before 1969. Respected for his guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago&#x27;s blues musicians before achieving his own fame and was instrumental in popularizing blues music in the mid-1960s. In 1965, he played on Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, including the single &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, and performed with Dylan at that year&#x27;s Newport Folk Festival.

Bloomfield was ranked No. 22 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; in 2003 and No. 42 by the same magazine in 2011. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2012 and, as a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015.

Bloomfield was portrayed by Eli Brown in the 2024 film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;.

==Early years==
Bloomfield was born in Chicago into a wealthy Jewish family. Bloomfield&#x27;s father, Harold, was born there in 1914. Harold&#x27;s father, Samuel Bloomfield, started Bloomfield Industries in the early 1930s. After Samuel passed away, Harold and his brother, Daniel, inherited the company. Bloomfield&#x27;s mother, Dorothy Klein, was born in Chicago in 1918 and married Harold in 1940. She came from an artistic, musical family, and worked as an actress and model before marrying.

Bloomfield&#x27;s family lived in various locations around Chicago before settling at 424 West Melrose Street on the North Side. When he was twelve his family moved to suburban Glencoe, where he attended New Trier High School for two years. During this time, he began playing in local bands, then put together one called the Hurricanes, named after Ohio rock band Johnny and the Hurricanes. New Trier expelled Bloomfield after his band performed a raucous rock and roll song at a 1959 school gathering. He attended Cornwall Academy in Massachusetts for one year and then returned to Chicago, where he spent his last year of education at a local Central YMCA High School.

Bloomfield had attended a 1957 Chicago performance by blues singer Josh White, and began spending time in Chicago&#x27;s South Side blues clubs and playing guitar with such black bluesmen as Sleepy John Estes, Yank Rachell, and Little Brother Montgomery. He first sat in with a black blues band in 1959, when he performed with Luther &quot;Guitar Junior&quot; Johnson at a Chicago club called the Place. He performed with Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Muddy Waters, and many other Chicago blues performers during the early 1960s. In 1962 he married Susan Smith.

Writing in 2001, keyboardist, songwriter and record producer Al Kooper said Bloomfield&#x27;s talent &quot;was instantly obvious to his mentors. They knew this was not just another white boy; this was someone who truly understood what the blues were all about.&quot; Among his early supporters were B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan and Buddy Guy. &quot;Michael used to say, &#x27;It&#x27;s a natural. Black people suffer externally in this country. Jewish people suffer internally. The suffering&#x27;s the mutual fulcrum for the blues.&#x27;&quot;

==The Butterfield Blues Band (1965–1967)==
In the early 1960s he met harmonica player and singer Paul Butterfield and guitarist Elvin Bishop, with whom he would later play in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. He also began friendships and professional associations with fellow Chicagoan Nick Gravenites and Bronx-born record producer Norman Dayron, who was attending the University of Chicago. He developed a friendship with blues singer Big Joe Williams. In 1963 Bloomfield and his two friends George Mitchell and Pete Welding ran a weekly blues showcase at the Fickle Pickle. He subsequently built up his reputation in two Chicago clubs, Big John&#x27;s and Magoo&#x27;s. With help from his friend Joel Harlib, a Chicago photographer who became Bloomfield&#x27;s de facto manager, he became a Columbia Records recording artist. In early 1964 Harlib took an audition tape by Bloomfield to Columbia producer and talent scout John Hammond, who signed him to Columbia&#x27;s Epic Records label.

Bloomfield recorded a few sessions for Columbia in 1964 that remained unreleased until after his death. In early 1965 he joined the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, which included Elvin Bishop and keyboardist Mark Naftalin, along with drummer Sam Lay and bassist Jerome Arnold, who had previously worked in Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s band. Elektra Records producer Paul Rothchild recorded the band in spring 1965, but the majority of the tracks were not released until the 1990s. However, one of the tracks Rothchild recorded during his first pass at producing the group, a Nick Gravenites song titled &quot;Born in Chicago&quot;, was included on the Elektra album &quot;Folksong &#x27;65&quot;, which sold two hundred thousand copies when it was released in September 1965. &quot;Born in Chicago&quot; became an underground hit for the Butterfield Band. Their debut album, &quot;The Paul Butterfield Blues Band&quot;, was recorded in September and released the following month.

In June 1965, Bloomfield had recorded with Bob Dylan, whom he had met in 1963 at a Chicago club called the Bear. The club was bankrolled by future Dylan and Butterfield manager Albert Grossman, who would play a major part in Bloomfield&#x27;s career. Bloomfield&#x27;s Telecaster guitar licks were featured on Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, a single produced by Columbia Record&#x27;s Tom Wilson. Bloomfield would play on most of the tracks on Dylan&#x27;s 1965 &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; album, and he appeared onstage with Dylan in July at the Newport Folk Festival, where Dylan used Bloomfield and the Butterfield Band—minus Paul Butterfield—along with keyboardists Al Kooper and Barry Goldberg. The show marked Dylan&#x27;s first use of an electric band in a live performance, and Bloomfield&#x27;s playing on the songwriter&#x27;s &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot; is considered a landmark electric-guitar performance. After the Newport Folk Festival ended, Bloomfield helped Dylan complete the sessions for &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, and Dylan asked Bloomfield to join his touring band. Bloomfield demurred, preferring to continue playing with the Butterfield Band.

When Sam Lay fell ill after a series of dates in November 1965, the Butterfield Band brought Chicago-born drummer Billy Davenport into the group. During the first part of 1966, the band played in California, and they recorded their second album, &quot;East-West&quot;, that summer. The record&#x27;s title track found the band exploring modal music, and it was based upon a song Gravenites and Bloomfield had been playing since 1965, &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;.

Bloomfield played on recording sessions between 1965 and 1967. His guitar playing had a huge impact on San Francisco Bay Area musicians after playing with the Butterfield band at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore in March 1966, San Francisco&#x27;s Avalon Ballroom and also in the Los Angeles area due to the storied two-week run at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach. He became a mentor and inspiration for many guitarists, especially in the SF Bay Area. He did a 1965 date with Peter, Paul and Mary that resulted in a song called &quot;The King of Names&quot;, and he recorded in 1966 with pop group Chicago Loop, whose &quot;When She Wants Good Lovin&#x27; (My Baby Comes to Me)&quot; made &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot;&#x27;s chart that year. He also played guitar on recordings by Chuck Berry, Mitch Ryder and James Cotton.

==The Electric Flag (1967–1968)==
Bloomfield tired of the Butterfield Band&#x27;s rigorous touring schedule, relocated to San Francisco, and sought to create his own group. He formed the short-lived Electric Flag in 1967, with two longtime Chicago collaborators, Barry Goldberg and vocalist Nick Gravenites. The band featured a horn section. The band&#x27;s rhythm section was composed of bassist Harvey Brooks and drummer Buddy Miles. Miles had previously played in Wilson Pickett&#x27;s touring band, while Brooks had performed with Al Kooper in bands in New York City, and had played with both Kooper and Bloomfield on Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;. The group&#x27;s first effort was the soundtrack for director-producer Roger Corman&#x27;s 1967 movie &quot;The Trip&quot;, which was recorded in the spring of that year.

The Electric Flag debuted at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and issued an album, &quot;A Long Time Comin&#x27;&quot;, in April 1968 on Columbia Records. Critics complimented the group&#x27;s distinctive, intriguing sound but found the record itself somewhat uneven. By that time, however, the band was already disintegrating, with rivalries between members, shortsighted management, and heroin abuse all taking their toll. Shortly after the release of that album, Bloomfield left the band, with Gravenites, Goldberg, and bassist Harvey Brooks following.

== Work with Al Kooper ==
Bloomfield also made an impact through his work with Al Kooper, who had played with Bloomfield on Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. Kooper had become an A&amp;R man for Columbia Records, and Bloomfield and Kooper had played piano on Moby Grape&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Grape Jam&quot;, an instrumental album that had been packaged with the group&#x27;s &quot;Wow&quot; collection.

&quot;Why not do an entire jam album together?&quot; Kooper remembered in 1998, writing the booklet notes for the Bloomfield anthology &quot;Don&#x27;t Say That I Ain&#x27;t Your Man: Essential Blues, 1964–1969&quot;. &quot;At the time, most jazz albums were made using this modus operandi: pick a leader or two co-leaders, hire appropriate sidemen, pick some tunes, make some up and record an entire album on the fly in one or two days. Why not try and legitimize rock by adhering to these standards? In addition, as a fan, I was dissatisfied with Bloomfield&#x27;s recorded studio output up until then. It seemed that his studio work was inhibited and reined in, compared to his incendiary live performances. Could I put him in a studio setting where he could feel free to just burn like he did in live performances?&quot;

The result was &quot;Super Session&quot;, a jam album that spotlighted Bloomfield&#x27;s guitar skills on one side. Bloomfield, who suffered from insomnia, left the sessions after the first day. Guitarist Stephen Stills completed the album with Kooper. It received excellent reviews and became the best-selling album of Bloomfield&#x27;s career. Its success led to a live sequel, &quot;The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper&quot;, recorded over three nights at Fillmore West in September 1968.

== Solo work ==

Bloomfield continued with solo, session and back-up work from 1968 to 1980. He played guitar on Mother Earth&#x27;s cover of Memphis Slim&#x27;s &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, a track from their 1968 &quot;Living with the Animals&quot; album, and on two albums by Texas-born soul singer Wayne Talbert. With Mark Naftalin, he produced the 1968 sessions for James Cotton&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Cotton in Your Ears&quot;. He released his first solo album, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Killing Me&quot;, in 1969. Bloomfield also helped Janis Joplin assemble her Kozmic Blues Band (for the album &quot;I Got Dem Ol&#x27; Kozmic Blues, Again Mama!&quot;) in 1969, co-wrote &quot;Work Me, Lord&quot; for the album, and played the guitar solo on Joplin&#x27;s blues composition &quot;One Good Man&quot;. Columbia released another 1969 album, a live concert jam, &quot;Live at Bill Graham&#x27;s Fillmore West&quot;, including Mark Naftalin, former Electric Flag bandmates Marcus Doubleday and Snooky Flowers, and a guest appearance by Taj Mahal. In the same year he reunited with Paul Butterfield and Sam Lay for the Chess Records album &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;, featuring Muddy Waters and pianist Otis Spann. Bloomfield composed and recorded the soundtrack for the film &quot;Medium Cool&quot;, directed by his second cousin, Haskell Wexler. The film includes footage shot in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. With Nick Gravenites, he produced blues guitarist Otis Rush&#x27;s 1969 album &quot;Mourning in the Morning&quot;, recorded at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama with a band that included keyboardists Mark Naftalin and Barry Beckett, along with guitarist Duane Allman.

During 1970 Bloomfield gave up playing because of his heroin addiction:

He recorded his second solo album, &quot;Try It Before You Buy It&quot;, in 1973. Columbia rejected it; the complete version of the record would not appear until 1990. Also in 1973, he cut &quot;Triumvirate&quot; with Dr. John and guitarist and singer John Hammond Jr. In 1973 he teamed up with Mark Naftalin, at a studio in Sausalito, to produce a one-off live album, &quot;Live at the Record Plant 1973&quot;. In 1974, he rejoined the Electric Flag for an album titled &quot;The Band Kept Playing&quot;. In 1975 he recorded an album with the group KGB. The group&#x27;s name is an acronym of the initials of singer and songwriter Ray Kennedy, Barry Goldberg and Bloomfield. The band also included Ric Grech and drummer Carmine Appice. Grech and Bloomfield quit shortly after its release. As the record hit stores in 1976, Bloomfield told journalists that the group had been an ill-conceived moneymaking project. The album was not well received by critics, but it did contain the standout track &quot;Sail On, Sailor&quot;. Its authorship was credited to &quot;Wilson-Kennedy&quot;, and had a bluesy, darker feel, along with Ray Kennedy&#x27;s original cocaine-related lyrics. In the same year, he performed with John Cale on Cale&#x27;s soundtrack for the film &quot;Caged Heat&quot;. In 1976 he recorded an instructional album for guitarists, &quot;If You Love These Blues, Play &#x27;Em as You Please&quot;, which was financed through &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine.

In the 1970s Bloomfield played in local San Francisco Bay area clubs, including the Keystone Korner, and sat in with other bands. In 1977, Bloomfield was selected by Andy Warhol to do the soundtrack for the pop artist&#x27;s last film, &quot;Andy Warhol&#x27;s Bad&quot; (also known as BAD). An unreleased single, &quot;Andy&#x27;s Bad&quot;, was also produced for the project. During 1979–1981 he performed often with the King Perkoff Band, sometimes introducing them as the &quot;Michael Bloomfield and Friends&quot; outfit. Bloomfield recorded &quot;Hustlin&#x27; Queen&quot;, written by John Isabeau and Perkoff in 1979. He toured Italy and Sweden with guitarist Woody Harris and cellist Maggie Edmondson in the summer of 1980. He sat in with Bob Dylan at San Francisco&#x27;s Warfield Theatre on November 15, 1980. Bloomfield played on Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;The Groom&#x27;s Still Waiting at the Altar&quot;. He continued to play live dates, with his performance at San Francisco State College on February 7, 1981, being his penultimate appearance. His final performance was at Mission Ranch, Carmel, CA, approximately 48 hours before his death. 

Bloomfield came from a wealthy family, and received annual income from a trust created by his paternal grandfather, which gave him $50,000 each year.

==Death==
Bloomfield died in San Francisco on February 15, 1981. He was found seated behind the wheel of his car, with all four doors locked. According to police, an empty Valium bottle was found on the car seat, but no suicide note was found. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy ruled the death accidental overdose, due to cocaine and methamphetamine poisoning. Bloomfield&#x27;s last album, &quot;Cruisin&#x27; for a Bruisin&quot;&#x27;, was released the day his death was announced. His remains are interred in a crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery, in Culver City, near Los Angeles.

==Style==

Bloomfield&#x27;s musical influences include Scotty Moore, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, B.B. King, Big Joe Williams, Otis Rush, Albert King, Freddie King and Ray Charles.

Bloomfield originally used a Fender Telecaster, though he had also used a Fender Duo-Sonic while recording for Columbia following his 1964 signing to the label. During his tenure with the Butterfield Blues Band, he used that Telecaster on the first Butterfield album and on their earliest tours in the fall of 1965. By November he had swapped that guitar for International Submarine Band guitarist John Nuese’s 1954 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop, acquired in Boston and used for some of the &quot;East-West&quot; sessions.

In 1967, Bloomfield swapped the Goldtop for guitar repairman/musician Dan Erlewine&#x27;s 1959 Les Paul Standard and $100. The Standard had proven unpopular in the late 1950s because it was deemed too heavy and expensive by rock and roll guitarists. Gibson discontinued manufacturing the model in 1960. Bloomfield used the Standard in the Electric Flag and on the &quot;Super Session&quot; album and concerts. He later switched between the it and the Telecaster, but his use of the Les Paul inspired other guitarists to use the model and spurred Gibson to reintroduce the Standard in 1968.

Bloomfield eventually lost the guitar in Canada when a club owner kept two he had left behind as partial compensation after Bloomfield cut short a round of appearances. He had been booked at the Cave in Vancouver, from Tue. Nov. 12th, 1974, for five days, until Sat. the 16th. The band played the first night but the next day Bloomfield boarded a plane and flew home to San Francisco with virtually no notice to the club, hotel, or band members; his friend Mark Naftalin found a note on a torn piece of paper in the hotel room that read, &quot;bye bye, sorry&quot;.

Unlike contemporaries such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, Bloomfield rarely experimented with feedback and distortion, preferring a loud yet clean, almost chiming sound, with a healthy amount of reverb and vibrato; this approach would strongly influence Jerry Garcia, who segued from a career in acoustic-based music to electric rock at the height of the Butterfield Band&#x27;s influence in 1965. One of his amplifiers of choice was a 1965 Fender Twin Reverb. His solos, like those of most blues guitarists, were based in the minor pentatonic scale and the blues scale. However, he liberally used chromatic notes within the pentatonic framework, and integrated Indian and Eastern influences in his solos.

Gibson has since released a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul, replicating his 1959 Standard—in recognition of his impact on the electric blues, his role in the revived production of the guitar, and his influence on many other guitarists. Because the actual guitar had been unaccounted for so many years, Gibson relied on hundreds of photographs provided by Bloomfield&#x27;s family to reproduce it. The model comes in two configurations—a Vintage Original Specifications (VOS), modified by Bloomfield&#x27;s mismatched volume and tone control knobs, missing toggle switch cover, and kidney-shaped tuners replacing the Gibson original, and a faithful process-aged reproduction of the guitar as it was when Bloomfield last played it, complete with the finish smudge below the bridge and various nicks and smudges elsewhere on the body.

<text>The Mahāsāṃghika (Brahmi: 𑀫𑀳𑀸𑀲𑀸𑀁𑀖𑀺𑀓, &quot;of the Great Sangha&quot;, ) was a major division (nikāya) of the early Buddhist schools in India. They were one of the two original communities that emerged from the first schism of the original pre-sectarian Buddhist tradition (the other being the Sthavira nikaya). This schism is traditionally held to have occurred after the Second Buddhist council, which occurred at some point during or after the reign of Kalashoka. The Mahāsāṃghika nikāya developed into numerous sects which spread throughout ancient India.

Some scholars think that the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya (monastic rule) represents the oldest Buddhist monastic source. While the Mahāsāṃghika tradition is no longer in existence, many scholars look to the Mahāsāṃghika tradition as an early source for some ideas that were later adopted by Mahāyāna Buddhism. Some of these ideas include the view that the Buddha was a fully transcendent being (term &quot;lokottaravada&quot;, &quot;transcendentalism&quot;), the idea that there are many contemporaneous Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the universe, the doctrine of the inherent purity and luminosity of the mind (Skt: &quot;prakṛtiś cittasya prabhāsvarā&quot;), the doctrine of reflexive awareness (&quot;svasamvedana&quot;) and the doctrine of &quot;prajñapti-matra&quot; (absolute nominalism or pure conceptualism).

== History ==

Most sources place the origin of the Mahāsāṃghikas to the Second Buddhist council. Traditions regarding the Second Council are confusing and ambiguous, but it is agreed that the overall result was the first schism in the Sangha between the Sthavira nikāya and the Mahāsāṃghika nikāya, although it is not agreed upon by all what the cause of this split was.

According to Jan Nattier and Charles S. Prebish, the best date for the first schism and the creation of the Mahāsāṃghika as a separate community is 116 years after the Buddha&#x27;s nirvana.

Some Buddhist historical sources mention that the cause for schism was a dispute over vinaya (monastic rule), mainly the desire of certain Sthaviras (elders) to add extra rules to make the vinaya more rigorous. Other sources, especially Sthavira sources like those of the Sarvastivada school, argue that the main cause was a doctrinal issue. They blame a figure named Mahadeva with arguing for five divisive points, four of which see arhatship as a lesser kind of spiritual attainment (which still has ignorance and desire).

Andrew Skilton has suggested that the problems of contradictory accounts about the first schism are solved by the Mahāsāṃghika &quot;Śāriputraparipṛcchā&quot;, which is the earliest surviving account of the schism. In this account, the council was convened at Pāṭaliputra over matters of vinaya, and it is explained that the schism resulted from the majority (Mahāsaṃgha) refusing to accept the addition of rules to the Vinaya by a smaller group of elders (Sthaviras). The Mahāsāṃghikas therefore saw the Sthaviras as being a breakaway group which was attempting to modify the original Vinaya and to make it more strict.

Scholars have generally agreed that the matter of dispute was indeed a matter of vinaya, and have noted that the account of the Mahāsāṃghikas is bolstered by the vinaya texts themselves, as vinayas associated with the Sthaviras do contain more rules than those of the Mahāsāṃghika vinaya.

Modern scholarship therefore generally agrees that the Mahāsāṃghika vinaya is the oldest. According to Skilton, future historians may determine that a study of the Mahāsāṃghika school will contribute to a better understanding of the early Dhamma-Vinaya than the Theravāda school.

Regarding the issue with Mahadeva&#x27;s doctrine, this seems to have been a later doctrinal dispute within the Mahāsāṃghika community (which happened after the schism). The followers of Mahadeva seem to have been the precursors of the southern Mahāsāṃghika sects, like the Caitikas.

=== Geography ===
The original center of the Mahāsāṃghika sects was Magadha, but they also maintained important centers such as in Mathura and Karli. The Kukkuṭikas were situated in eastern India around Vārāṇasī and Pāṭaliputra and the Bahuśrutīya in Kośala, Andhra, and Gandhara.

The Lokottaravāda subschool itself claimed to be of the &#x27;Middle Country&#x27;, i.e. Ganges Basin region in the north of India. The Mahāsāṃghikas and the Lokottaravāda subschool also had centres in the Gandhara region. The Ekavyāvahārika are not known from later times.

The Caitika branch was based in the Coastal Andhra region and especially at Amarāvati and Nāgārjunakoṇḍā. This Caitika branch included the Pūrvaśailas, Aparaśailas, Rājagirikas, and the Siddhārthikas.

Finally, Madhyadesa was home to the Prajñaptivādins. The ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Krishna Valley, including Amarāvati, Nāgārjunakoṇḍā and Jaggayyapeṭa, &quot;can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier.&quot;

The cave temples at the Ajaṇṭā Caves, the Ellora Caves, and the Karla Caves are associated with the Mahāsāṃghikas.

==Appearance and language==

===Appearance===
Between 148 and 170 CE, the Parthian monk An Shigao came to China and translated a work which describes the color of monastic robes (Skt. &quot;kāṣāya&quot;) utilized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called &quot;Da Biqiu Sanqian Weiyi&quot; (Ch. 大比丘三千威儀). Another text translated at a later date, the &quot;Śāriputraparipṛcchā&quot;, contains a very similar passage corroborating this information. In both sources, the Mahāsāṃghikas are described as wearing yellow robes. The relevant portion of the &quot;Śāriputraparipṛcchā&quot; reads:

The lower part of the yellow robe was pulled tightly to the left.

According to Dudjom Rinpoche from the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the robes of fully ordained Mahāsāṃghika monastics were to be sewn out of more than seven sections, but no more than twenty-three sections. The symbols sewn on the robes were the endless knot (Skt. &quot;śrīvatsa&quot;) and the conch shell (Skt. &quot;śaṅkha&quot;), two of the Eight Auspicious Signs in Buddhism.

===Language===
The Tibetan historian Buton Rinchen Drub (1290–1364) wrote that the Mahāsāṃghikas used Prākrit, the Sarvāstivādins Sanskrit, the Sthaviravādins used Paiśācī and the Saṃmitīya used Apabhraṃśa.

==Doctrines and teachings==

=== List of doctrinal tenets ===
An important source for the doctrines of the Mahāsāṃghika is the &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot; (&quot;The Cycle of the Formation of the Schismatic Doctrines&quot;, Ch: 異部宗輪論) of Vasumitra (a Sarvāstivāda scholar, c. 2nd century CE), which was translated by Xuanzang.

According to this source, some of the key doctrines defended by Indian Mahāsāṃghikas include: 
# The Buddhas are supramundane (&quot;lokottara&quot;), devoid of asravas and the mundane natures.
# All words spoken by Tathagatas turn the wheel of Dharma and none of their words are false.
# Buddhas teach all dharmas with a single sound.
# The material body (&quot;rupakaya&quot;), supernatural power (&quot;prabhava&quot;) and lifespan (ayus) of a Buddha is unlimited (&quot;ananta&quot;).
# The Buddha’s heart never tires of converting living beings by awakening faith (sraddha) in them.
# The Buddha does not sleep or dream.
# The Tathagata answers questions without thinking (or reflecting on things).
# Buddhas never say a single word because they are always in samadhi, but beings rejoice, thinking that they utter words.
# In a single moment of thought (&quot;ekaksanikacitta&quot;), Buddhas comprehend all dharmas.
# The Buddhas remain in all directions. There are Buddhas everywhere in the four directions.
# When the Bodhisattvas enter into a womb (&quot;garbha&quot;), they possess nothing impure and are entirely provided with organs and members, rather than developing gradually. When they enter a womb, Bodhisattvas also take on the appearance of a white elephant.
# Bodhisattvas, because they want to help beings become perfect, make vows to be reborn in bad destinations (durgati).
# The different aspects of the four noble truths are known in a single moment (&quot;ekaksanika&quot;).
# The five sensory (&quot;indriya&quot;) faculties consist of balls of flesh, therefore only consciousness (&quot;vijñana&quot;) sees forms, hears sounds, etc.
# There are no indeterminate (avyakrta) things (dharma), that is, there are no dharmas that are neither good nor bad.
# When one enters certainty [to become a Buddha] (&quot;samyaktvaniyama&quot;) one has abandoned all the fetters (&quot;samyojana&quot;).
# &quot;Stream enterers&quot; (&quot;srotapanna&quot;) can commit all misdeeds, except for the irremediable crimes (&quot;anantarya&quot;).
# All sutras uttered by Buddha are &quot;nītārtha&quot; (&quot;of plain or clear meaning&quot;).
# Since they do not know everything (&quot;sabba&quot;), there are Arhats who lack knowledge (&quot;ajñana&quot;), who have doubts (&quot;kariksa&quot;), who are saved by others.
# The self-presence of mind is bright. It is soiled (i.e. darkened) by adventitious secondary defilement.
# The tendencies (&quot;anusaya&quot;) are neither consciousnesses (&quot;citta&quot;) nor mental factors (&quot;caitta&quot;), and are devoid of object (&quot;analambana&quot;).
# The past and the future have no substantial existence (dravya).
# There is no intermediate state (&quot;antarabhava&quot;).
# Virtue (&quot;sila&quot;) is not mental (&quot;acetasika&quot;) and it is not consecutive to thought (&quot;cittanuparivatti&quot;).
# Tendencies (&quot;anusaya&quot;) are indeterminate (&quot;abyakata&quot;), not-caused (&quot;ahetuka&quot;) and disjointed from thought (&quot;cittavippayutta&quot;).
# There is a root-consciousness (&quot;mūlavijñāna&quot;) which serves as the support (dsraya) for eye-perception and the other sensory perceptions, like the root of the tree is the principle of the leaves, etc.
# The current consciousnesses (&quot;pavattiviññāna&quot;) can be simultaneous (&quot;sahabhu&quot;) and do not carry karmic seeds (&quot;bija&quot;).
# The path (&quot;marga&quot;) and the defilements (&quot;kleśa&quot;) appear together.
# The act (&quot;karman&quot;) and its maturation (&quot;vipaka&quot;) evolve at the same time.
# Material things last a long time and so go through transformation (as milk turns into curds), but mental factors and consciousnesses do not because they have a swift production and cessation.
# Thought (&quot;citta&quot;) penetrates the whole body (&quot;kaya&quot;) and, depending on the object (&quot;visaya&quot;) and the support (&quot;asraya&quot;), it can contract or expand.

=== Buddhas and bodhisattvas ===
The Mahāsāṃghikas advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats. Xing also notes that the &quot;Acchariyābbhūtasutta&quot; of the Majjhimanikāya along with its Chinese Madhyamāgama parallel version is the most prominent evidence for the ancient source of the Mahāsāṃghika view of the Buddha. The sutra mentions various miracles performed by the Buddha before his birth and after. While the Pāli sutta uses the term bodhisattva for the Buddha before his birth, the Chinese version calls him Bhagavan. This points to the idea that the Buddha was already awakened before descending down to earth.

Similarly, the idea that the lifespan of a Buddha is limitless is also based on very ancient ideas. The Mahāparinirvānasūtra states that the Buddha&#x27;s lifespan is as long as an eon (kalpa) and that he voluntarily chose to give up his life. Another early source for the Mahāsāṃghika view that a Buddha was a transcendent being is the idea of the thirty-two major marks of a Buddha&#x27;s body. Furthermore, the &quot;Simpsapa sutta&quot; states that the Buddha had way more knowledge than what he taught to his disciples. The Mahāsāṃghikas took this further and argued that the Buddha knew the dharmas of innumerable other Buddhas of the ten directions. 
Of the 48 special theses attributed by the &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot; to the Mahāsāṃghikas (Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, and Kukkuṭika), twenty concern the supramundane nature of buddhas and bodhisattvas. According to the &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot;, these four groups held that the Buddha is able to know all &quot;dharmas&quot; in a single moment of the mind. Yao Zhihua writes:

A doctrine ascribed to the Mahāsāṃghikas is, &quot;The power of the tathāgatas is unlimited, and the life of the buddhas is unlimited.&quot; According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in Mahāsāṃghika teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through his skillful means (Skt. &quot;upāya&quot;). For the Mahāsāṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was merely one of these transformation bodies (Skt. &quot;nirmāṇakāya&quot;), while the essential real Buddha was equated with the Dharmakāya.

The Mahāsāṃghika Lokānuvartanā sūtra makes numerous supramundane claims about the Buddha, including that:

* He was not produced through union of father and mother, but magically produced.
* His feet never touch the ground or get dirty, his footprints are only a show.
* His body and mouth does not get dirty, he only makes a show of cleaning himself. 
* He did not really suffer and struggle to attain enlightenment for six years, this was just a show. 
* He never gets hungry, he only manifests this in order to allow others to gain merit by giving. 
* He does not really produce human waste, this is only a show. 
* His body does not grow tired, ill or old, and is not affected by cold or heat, it only appears to have these qualities.

Like the Mahāyāna traditions, the Mahāsāṃghikas held the doctrine of the existence of many contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions. In the Mahāsāṃghika &quot;Lokānuvartana Sūtra&quot;, it is stated, &quot;The Buddha knows all the dharmas of the countless buddhas of the ten directions.&quot; It is also stated, &quot;All buddhas have one body, the body of the Dharma.&quot;

In the view of Mahāsāṃghikas, advanced bodhisattvas have severed the bonds of karma, and are born out of their own free will into lower states of existence (Skt. &quot;durgati&quot;) in order to help liberate other sentient beings. As described by Akira Hirakawa:

The concept of many bodhisattvas simultaneously working toward buddhahood is also found among the Mahāsāṃghika tradition, and further evidence of this is given in the &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot;, which describes the doctrines of the Mahāsāṃghikas. These two concepts of contemporaneous bodhisattvas and contemporaneous buddhas were linked in some traditions, and texts such as the &quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa&quot; use the principle of contemporaneous bodhisattvas to demonstrate the necessity of contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions. It is thought that the doctrine of contemporaneous buddhas was already old and well established by the time of early Mahāyāna texts such as the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;, due to the clear presumptions of this doctrine.

===Mundane and supramundane===
The Mahāsāṃghikas held that the teachings of the Buddha were to be understood as having two principal levels of truth: a relative or conventional (Skt. &quot;saṃvṛti&quot;) truth, and the absolute or ultimate (Skt. &quot;paramārtha&quot;) truth. For the Mahāsāṃghika branch of Buddhism, the final and ultimate meaning of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings was &quot;beyond words,&quot; and words were merely the conventional exposition of the Dharma. K. Venkata Ramanan writes:

=== Self-awareness and the mind ===
Some Mahāsāṃghikas held a theory of self-awareness or self-cognition (&quot;svasaṃvedana&quot;) which held that a moment of consciousness (citta) can be aware of itself as well as its intentional object. This doctrine arose out of their understanding of the Buddha&#x27;s enlightenment which held that in a single moment of mind the Buddha knew all things.

The &quot;Mahāvibhāṣa Śāstra&quot; explains the doctrine of self-reflexive awareness as follows: Some allege that the mind (&quot;citta&quot;) and mental activities (&quot;caitta&quot;) can apprehend themselves (&quot;svabhāva&quot;). Schools like Mahāsāṃghika hold the following view: It is the nature of awareness (&quot;jñāna&quot;) and so forth to apprehend, thus awareness can apprehend itself as well as others. This is like a lamp that can illuminate itself and others owing to its nature (&quot;svabhāva&quot;) of luminosity.Some Mahāsāṃghikas also held that the mind&#x27;s nature (&quot;cittasvabhāva&quot;) is fundamentally pure (&quot;mulavisuddha&quot;), but it can be contaminated by adventitious defilements. Vasumitra&#x27;s &quot;Nikayabheda-dharmamati-chakra-sastra&quot; also discusses this theory, and cites the sutra passage which the Mahāsāṃghikas drew on to defend it. The passage is quoted by Vasumitra as: The self-nature of the mind (&quot;cittasvabhāva&quot;) is luminous (&quot;prabhāsvara&quot;). It is the adventitious impurities (&quot;āgantukopakleśa&quot;) that defile it. The self substance of the mind is eternally pure.The commentary to Vasumitra by Kuiji adds the following: &quot;It is because afflictions (&quot;kleśa)&quot; are produced which soil it that it is said to be defiled. But these defilements, not being of the original nature of the mind, are called adventitious.&quot; The &quot;Kathāvatthu&quot; (III, 3) also cites this idea as a thesis of the Andhakas.

=== Unconditioned realities ===
According to Vasumitra, the Mahāsāṃghikas held that there were nine dharmas (phenomena, realities) which were unconditioned or unconstructed (asaṃskṛta):

# Cessation obtained through discriminative cognition (pratisaṃkhyānirodha)
# Cesation due to absence of a productive cause (apratisaṃkhyānirodha)
# Space (ākāśā)
# The sphere of unlimited space (ākāśānantyāyatana)
# The sphere of unlimited consciousness (vijñānānantyāyatana)
# The sphere of emptiness (ākiñcanyāyatana)
# The sphere of neither identification nor nonidentification (naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana)
# The own-nature of the members of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpādāṅgasvabhāva)
# The own-nature of the members of the holy path (ārya-mārgāṅgasvabhāva)

==Texts==
According to Bart Dessein, the &quot;Mohe sengzhi lu&quot; (Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya) provides some insight into the format of this school&#x27;s textual canon. They appear to have had a Vinaya in five parts, an Abhidharmapiṭaka, and a Sutrapiṭaka:Of these texts, their Vinaya was translated into Chinese by Buddhabhadra and Faxian between 416 and 418 CE in the Daochang Monastery in Nanjing, capital of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. In this text, their Abhidharma is defined as &quot;the &quot;sūtrānta&quot; in nine parts&quot; (&quot;navāṅga&quot;). This suggests that the early Mahāsāṃghikas rejected the abhidharmic developments that occurred within Sarvāstivāda circles. As is the case with their Vinayapiṭaka, also their Sutrapiṭaka seems to have consisted of five parts (&quot;āgama&quot;): *&quot;Dīrghāgama&quot;,*&quot;Madhyamāgama&quot;,*&quot;Saṃyuktāgama&quot;, *&quot;Ekottarāgama&quot; and *&quot;Kṣudrakāgama&quot;. Dessein also mentions that the school probably also had a Bodhisattvapiṭaka, which included material that &quot;in all likelihood consisted of texts that formed part of the early development of the bodhisattva path as an alternative career to that of the arhant, perhaps serving as a foundation for the later developments of the bodhisattva doctrine&quot;.

=== Vinaya texts ===
According to Zhihua Yao, the following Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya texts are extant in Chinese: &quot;Mahāsāṃghika bhiksuni-vinaya&quot;, &quot;Pratimoksa-sutra&quot;, &quot;Sphutartha Srighanacarasamgrahatika, Abhisamacarika-Dharma&quot; and the &quot;Mahavastu&quot;.

Zhan Ru also notes that the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya (Chinese: Mohe Sengqi Lü) translated by Faxian (337–422 CE) contains proto-Mahayana elements and &quot;reflects the nascent formation of the Mahāyāna Dharma teachings.&quot;

The &quot;Mahāvastu&quot; (Sanskrit for &quot;Great Event&quot; or &quot;Great Story&quot;) is the most well known of the Lokottaravāda branch of the Mahāsāṃghika school. It is a preface to their Vinaya Pitaka and contains numerous Jātaka and Avadāna tales, stories of past lives of the Buddha and other bodhisattvas. It is considered a primary source for the notion of a transcendent (&quot;&quot;lokottara&quot;&quot;) Buddha, who across his countless past lives developed various abilities such as omniscience (sarvajñana), the lack of any need for sleep or food and being born painlessly without the need for intercourse. The text shows strong parallels with the Pali &quot;Mahakhandhaka.&quot;

The &quot;Śariputraparipṛcchā&quot; (&quot;Shelifu Wen Jing&quot;, 舍利弗問經, Taisho 1465, p. 900b), translated into Chinese between 317 and 420, is a Mahasamghika Vinaya work which also provides a history of early Buddhism and its schisms.

=== Sutras ===
Some scholars such as Yao and Tse Fu Kuan consider the &quot;Ekottara Āgama&quot; (Taishō Tripiṭaka 125) to belong to the Mahāsāṃghika school, though this is still up for debate.

The &quot;Lokānuvartanā sūtra&quot; (Chinese: 佛説内藏百寶經, pinyin: &quot;fóshuō nèi zàng bǎi bǎo jīng,&quot; Taishō Tripiṭaka, Volume 17, text No. 807) is a text preserved in some Sanskrit fragments as well as in Tibetan and Chinese translation.

Furthemore, another sutra in the Chinese canon which has similar Mahāsāṃghika themes to the &quot;Lokānuvartanā&quot; is the &quot;Pusaxingwushiyuanshengjing&quot; (Sutra Spoken by the Buddha on (the characteristic marks of) His Appearance as (the result of) Fifty Causes of the Practice of Bodhisattva).

===Abhidharma treatises and commentaries===
According to some sources, abhidharma was not accepted as canonical by the Mahāsāṃghika school. The Theravādin &quot;Dīpavaṃsa&quot;, for example, records that the Mahāsāṃghikas had no abhidharma.

However, other sources indicate that there were such collections of abhidharma. During the early 5th century, the Chinese pilgrim Faxian is said to have found a Mahāsāṃghika abhidharma at a monastery in Pāṭaliputra. Furthermore, when Xuanzang visited Dhānyakaṭaka, he met two Mahāsāṃghika bhikṣus and studied Mahāsāṃghika abhidharma with them for several months. On the basis of textual evidence as well as inscriptions at Nāgārjunakoṇḍā, Joseph Walser concludes that at least some Mahāsāṃghika sects probably had an abhidharma collection, and that it likely contained five or six books.

The &quot;Tattvasiddhi-Śāstra&quot; (&quot;the treatise that accomplishes reality&quot;; C: 成實論, &quot;Chengshilun&quot;), is an Abhidharma work by a figure known as Harivarman (250–350). Some scholars including A.K. Warder, attribute the work to the Mahāsāṃghika-Bahusrutiyas, however others disagree and see it as a Sautrantika work. Chinese sources mention that he was initially a Sautrantika teacher who later lived with the Mahāsāṃghikas.

The Chinese canon also includes a sutra commentary called the &quot;Fen&quot;-&quot;bie&quot;-&quot;gong&quot;-&quot;de&quot;-&quot;lun&quot;. (分別功徳論) in the 25th volume of the Taisho Tripitaka Series (No. 1507, pp. 30–52).

=== Manuscript collections ===
The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda monastery in the 7th century at Bamyan, Afghanistan, and this monastery site has since been rediscovered by archaeologists. Birch bark manuscripts and palm-leaf manuscripts of texts in this monastery&#x27;s collection, including Mahayana sutras, have been discovered at the site, and these are now located in the Schøyen Collection. Some manuscripts are in the Gāndhārī language and Kharoṣṭhī script, while others are in Sanskrit and written in forms of the Gupta script.

Manuscripts and fragments that have survived from this monastery&#x27;s collection include the following source texts:

* &quot;Prātimokṣa Vibhaṅga&quot; of the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda (MS 2382/269)
* &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, a sutra from the Āgamas (MS 2179/44)
* &quot;Caṃgī Sūtra&quot;, a sūtra from the Āgamas (MS 2376)
* &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot;, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2385)

* &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot;, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378)
* &quot;Pravāraṇa Sūtra&quot;, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378)
* &quot;Sarvadharmapravṛttinirdeśa Sūtra&quot;, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378)

* &quot;Śāriputrābhidharma&quot; (MS 2375/08)

=== Bodhisattva collection ===
Within the Mahāsāṃghika branch, the Bahuśrutīyas are said to have included a Bodhisattva Piṭaka in their canon, and Paramārtha wrote that the Bahuśrutīyas accepted both the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings. In the 6th century CE, Bhāvaviveka speaks of the Siddhārthikas using a Vidyādhāra Piṭaka, and the Pūrvaśailas and Aparaśailas both using a Bodhisattva Piṭaka, all implying collections of Mahāyāna texts within the Mahāsāṃghika schools. During the same period, Avalokitavrata speaks of the Mahāsāṃghikas using a &quot;Great Āgama Piṭaka,&quot; which is then associated with Mahāyāna sūtras such as the &quot;Prajñāparamitā&quot; and the &quot;Daśabhūmika Sūtra&quot;.

==Relationship to Mahāyāna==
===Acceptance of Mahāyāna===
In the 6th century CE, Paramārtha, a Buddhist monk from Ujjain in central India, wrote about a special affiliation of the Mahāsāṃghika school with the Mahāyāna tradition. He associates the initial composition and acceptance of Mahāyāna sūtras with the Mahāsāṃghika branch of Buddhism. He states that 200 years after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha, much of the Mahāsāṃghika school moved north of Rājagṛha, and were divided over whether the Mahāyāna teachings should be incorporated formally into their Tripiṭaka. According to this account, they split into three groups based upon the relative manner and degree to which they accepted the authority of these Mahāyāna texts.

Paramārtha states that the Kukkuṭika sect did not accept the Mahāyāna sūtras as &quot;buddhavacana&quot; (&quot;word of the Buddha&quot;), while the Lokottaravāda sect and the Ekavyāvahārika sect did accept the Mahāyāna sūtras as &quot;buddhavacana&quot;. Paramartha&#x27;s report states:In this school, there were some who believed these sutras and some who did not. Those who did not believe them ... said that such sutras are made by man and are not proclaimed by the Buddha, ... that the disciples of the Lesser Vehicle only believe in the Tripitaka, because they did not personally hear the Buddha proclaim the Greater Vehicle. Among those who believed these sutras, there were some who did so because they had personally heard the Buddha proclaim the Greater Vehicle and therefore believed these sutras; others believed them, because it can be known through logical analysis that there is this principle [of the Greater Vehicle]; and some believed them because they believed their masters. Those who did not believe [them] did so because these sutras were self-made and because they were not included in the five Agamas.Paramārtha also wrote about the origins of the Bahuśrutīya sect in connection with acceptance of Mahāyāna teachings. According to his account, the founder of the Bahuśrutīya sect was named Yājñavalkya. In Paramārtha&#x27;s account, Yājñavalkya is said to have lived during the time of the Buddha, and to have heard his discourses, but was in a profound state of samādhi during the time of the Buddha&#x27;s parinirvāṇa. After Yājñavalkya emerged from this samādhi 200 years later, he discovered that the Mahāsāṃghikas were teaching only the superficial meaning of the sūtras, and therefore founded the Bahuśrutīya sect in order to expound the full meaning.

According to Paramārtha, the Bahuśrutīya school was formed in order to fully embrace both &quot;conventional truth&quot; and &quot;ultimate truth.&quot; Bart Dessein links the Bahuśrutīya understanding of this full exposition to the Mahāyāna teachings. In his writings, Paramārtha also indicated as much:

===Royal patronage===
Some early Mahāyāna sūtras reference wealthy female donors and provide evidence that they were developed in the Āndhra region, where the Mahāsāṃghika Caitika groups were predominant. The Mahāyāna &quot;Mahāmegha Sūtra&quot;, for example, gives a prophecy about a royal princess of the Śatavāhana dynasty who will live in Āndhra, along the Kṛṣṇa River, in Dhānyakaṭaka, seven hundred years after the &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; of the Buddha.

Several scholars such as Étienne Lamotte, and Alex and Hideko Wayman, associate the Āndra Ikṣvāku dynasty with patronage of Mahāyāna sūtras. Epigraphic evidence at Nāgārjunikoṇḍa also provides abundant evidence of royal and wealthy female donors.

===Prajñāpāramitā===
A number of scholars have proposed that the Mahāyāna Prajñāpāramitā teachings were first developed by the Caitika subsect of the Mahāsāṃghikas. They believe that the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; originated amongst the southern Mahāsāṃghika schools of the Āndhra region, along the Kṛṣṇa River. Guang Xing states, &quot;several scholars have suggested that the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahāsāṃghikas in southern India, in the Āndhra country, on the Kṛṣṇa River.&quot; These Mahāsāṃghikas had two famous monasteries near Amarāvati and the Dhānyakaṭaka, which gave their names to the schools of the Pūrvaśailas and the Aparaśailas. Each of these schools had a copy of the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; in Prakrit. Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; as being that of the Mahāsāṃghikas. Edward Conze estimates that this sūtra originated around 100 BCE.

===Buddha-nature doctrine===
Brian Edward Brown, a specialist in Tathāgatagarbha doctrines, writes that it has been determined that the composition of the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; occurred during the Īkṣvāku Dynasty in the 3rd century as a product of the Mahāsāṃghikas of the Āndhra region (i.e. the Caitika schools). Wayman has outlined eleven points of complete agreement between the Mahāsāṃghikas and the &quot;Śrīmālā&quot;, along with four major arguments for this association. Anthony Barber also associates the earlier development of the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; with the Mahāsāṃghikas, and concludes that the Mahāsāṃghikas of the Āndhra region were responsible for the inception of the Tathāgatagarbha doctrine.

According to Stephen Hodge, internal textual evidence in the &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra&quot;, &quot;Mahābherihāraka Parivarta Sūtra&quot;, and the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;, indicates that these texts were first circulated in South India and then gradually propagated up to the northwest, with Kashmir being the other major center. The &quot;Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra&quot; gives a more detailed account by mentioning the points of distribution as including South India, the Vindhya Range, Bharuch, and Kashmir.

The language used in the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; and related texts, seems to indicate a region in southern India during the time of the Śātavāhana Dynasty. The Śātavāhana rulers gave rich patronage to Buddhism, and were involved with the development of the cave temples at Karla and Ajaṇṭā, and also with the Great Stūpa at Amarāvati. During this time, the Śātavāhana Dynasty also maintained extensive links with the Kuṣāṇa Empire.

Using textual evidence in the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot; and related texts, Stephen Hodge estimates a compilation period between 100 CE and 220 CE for the &quot;Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra&quot;. Hodge summarizes his findings as follows:

In the 6th century CE, Paramārtha wrote that the Mahāsāṃghikas revere the sūtras which teach the Tathāgatagarbha.

=== Views of scholars ===
Since at least the Meiji period in Japan, some scholars of Buddhism have looked to the Mahāsāṃghika as the originators of Mahāyāna Buddhism. According to Akira Hirakawa, modern scholars often look to the Mahāsāṃghikas as the originators of Mahāyāna Buddhism.

According to A.K. Warder, it is &quot;clearly&quot; the case that the Mahāyāna teachings originally came from the Mahāsāṃghika branch of Buddhism. Warder holds that &quot;the Mahāyāna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the Āndhra country.&quot; Anthony Barber and Sree Padma note that &quot;historians of Buddhist thought have been aware for quite some time that such pivotally important Mahayana Buddhist thinkers as Nāgārjuna, Dignaga, Candrakīrti, Āryadeva, and Bhavaviveka, among many others, formulated their theories while living in Buddhist communities in Āndhra.&quot;

André Bareau has stated that there can be found Mahāyāna ontology prefigured in the Mahāsāṃghika schools, and has offered an array of evidence to support this conclusion. Bareau traces the origin of the Mahāyāna tradition to the older Mahāsāṃghika schools in regions such as Odisha, Kosala, Koñkana, and so on. He then cites the Bahuśrutīyas and Prajñaptivādins as sub-sects of the Mahāsāṃghika that may have played an important role in bridging the flow of Mahāyāna teachings between the northern and southern Mahāsāṃghika traditions.

André Bareau also mentions that according to Xuanzang and Yijing in the 7th century CE, the Mahāsāṃghika schools had essentially disappeared, and instead these travelers found what they described as &quot;Mahāyāna.&quot; The region occupied by the Mahāsāṃghika was then an important center for Mahāyāna Buddhism. Bareau has proposed that Mahāyāna grew out of the Mahāsāṃghika schools, and the members of the Mahāsāṃghika schools also accepted the teachings of the Mahāyāna. Additionally, the extant Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya was originally procured by Faxian in the early 5th century CE at what he describes as a &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; monastery in Pāṭaliputra.

==Vinaya recension==
===Early features===

The Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya recension is essentially very similar to the other recensions, as they all are to each other. The Mahāsāṃghika recension differs most from the other recensions in structure, but the rules are generally identical in meaning, if the Vibhangas (explanations) are compared. The features of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya recension which suggest that it might be an older redaction are, in brief, these:

The &quot;Bhiksu-prakirnaka&quot; and&quot; Bhiksuni-prakirnaka&quot; and the &quot;Bhiksu-abhisamacarika-dharma&quot; sections of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya are generally equivalent to the &quot;Khandhakas&quot;/ &quot;Skandhakas&quot; of the Sthavira derived schools. However, their structure is simpler, and according to recent research by Clarke, the structure follows a &quot;matika&quot; (Matrix) which is also found embedded in the Vinayas of several of the Sthavira schools, suggesting that it is presectarian. The sub-sections of the &quot;Prakirnaka&quot; sections are also titled &quot;pratisamyukta&quot; rather than Skandhaka / Khandhaka. &quot;Pratisamyukta&quot; / &quot;Patisamyutta&quot; means a section or chapter in a collection organised by subject; the &quot;&#x27;samyukta&quot;-principle&#x27;, like the &quot;Samyutta-Nikaya&quot; / &quot;Samyukta-agama&quot;. Scholars such as Master Yin Shun, Choong Moon Keat, and Bhikkhu Sujato have argued that the &quot;Samyutta&quot; / &quot;Samyukta&quot; represents the earliest collection among the Nikayas / Agamas, and this may well imply that it is also the oldest &quot;organising principle&quot; too. (N.B. this does not necessarily say anything about the age of the contents).

There are also fewer stories in general in the Vinaya of the subsidiary school, the Mahāsāṃghika-Lokottaravāda, and many of them give the appearance of badly connected obvious interpolations, whereas in the structure of the Sthavira recensions the stories are integrated into the whole scheme. In the formulations of some of the pratimoksha rules also, the phrasing (though generally identical in meaning to the other recensions) often appears to represent a clearer but less streamlined version, which suggests it might be older. This is particularly noticeable in the &quot;Bhiksuni-Vinaya&quot;, which has not been as well preserved as the &quot;Bhiksu-Vinaya&quot; in general in all the recensions. Yet the formulation of certain rules which seem very confused in the other recensions (e.g. &quot;Bhikkhuni Sanghadisesa&quot; three = six in the Ma-L) seems to better represent what would be expected of a root formulation which could lead to the variety of confused formulations we see (presumably later) in the other recensions. The formulation of this rule (as an example) also reflects a semi-parallel formulation to a closely related rule for Bhiksus which is found in a more similar form in all the Vinayas (Pc64 in Pali).

===Depiction of Devadatta===
According to Reginald Ray, the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya mentions the figure of Devadatta, but in a way that is different from the vinayas of the Sthavira branch. According to this study, the earliest vinaya material common to all sects simply depicts Devadatta as a Buddhist saint who wishes for the monks to live a rigorous lifestyle. This has led Ray to regard the story of Devadatta as a legend produced by the Sthavira group. However, upon examining the same vinaya materials, Bhikkhu Sujato has written that the portrayals of Devadatta are largely consistent between the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya and the other vinayas, and that the supposed discrepancy is simply due to the minimalist literary style of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya. He also points to other parts of the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya that clearly portray Devadatta as a villain, as well as similar portrayals that exist in the Lokottaravādin &quot;Mahāvastu&quot;.

===Chinese translation===
The Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya is extant in the Chinese Buddhist Canon as &quot;Mohesengzhi Lü&quot; (摩訶僧祗律; Taishō Tripiṭaka 1425). The vinaya was originally procured by Faxian in the early 5th century CE at a Mahāyāna monastery in Pāṭaliputra. This vinaya was then translated into Chinese as a joint effort between Faxian and Buddhabhadra in 416 CE, and the completed translation is 40 fascicles in length. According to Faxian, in Northern India, the vinaya teachings were typically only passed down by tradition through word of mouth and memorization. For this reason, it was difficult for him to procure manuscripts of the vinayas that were used in India. The Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya was reputed to be the original vinaya from the lifetime of the Buddha, and &quot;the most correct and complete.&quot;

===Legacy===
Although Faxian procured the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya in India and had this translated into Chinese, the tradition of Chinese Buddhism eventually settled on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya instead. At the time of Faxian, the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya was the most common vinaya tradition in China.

In the 7th century, Yijing wrote that in eastern China, most people followed the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, while the Mahāsāṃghika Vinaya was used in earlier times in Guanzhong (the region around Chang&#x27;an), and that the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya was prominent in the Yangzi region and further south. In the 7th century, the existence of multiple Vinaya lineages throughout China was criticized by prominent Vinaya masters such as Yijing and Dao&#x27;an (654–717). In the early 8th century, Dao&#x27;an gained the support of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, and an imperial edict was issued that the saṃgha in China should use only the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya for ordination.

Atiśa was ordained in the Mahāsāṃghika lineage. However, because the Tibetan Emperor Ralpacan had decreed that only the Mūlasarvāstivāda order would be permitted in Tibet, he did not ordain anyone.

<doc id="599563" wikidata="Q852341" url="?curid=599563" title="Voltage-controlled oscillator">
<text>A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is an electronic oscillator whose oscillation frequency is controlled by a voltage input. The applied input voltage determines the instantaneous oscillation frequency. Consequently, a VCO can be used for frequency modulation (FM) or phase modulation (PM) by applying a modulating signal to the control input. A VCO is also an integral part of a phase-locked loop. VCOs are used in synthesizers to generate a waveform whose pitch can be adjusted by a voltage determined by a musical keyboard or other input.

A voltage-to-frequency converter (VFC) is a special type of VCO designed to be very linear in frequency control over a wide range of input control voltages.

==Types==
VCOs can be generally categorized into two groups based on the type of waveform produced.

* &quot;Linear&quot; or &quot;harmonic oscillators&quot; generate a sinusoidal waveform. Harmonic oscillators in electronics usually consist of a resonator with an amplifier that replaces the resonator losses (to prevent the amplitude from decaying) and isolates the resonator from the output (so the load does not affect the resonator). Some examples of harmonic oscillators are LC oscillators and crystal oscillators.
* &quot;Relaxation oscillators&quot; can generate a sawtooth or triangular waveform. They are commonly used in integrated circuits (ICs). They can provide a wide range of operational frequencies with a minimal number of external components.

==Frequency control==
A voltage-controlled capacitor is one method of making an LC oscillator vary its frequency in response to a control voltage. Any reverse-biased semiconductor diode displays a measure of voltage-dependent capacitance and can be used to change the frequency of an oscillator by varying a control voltage applied to the diode. Special-purpose variable-capacitance varactor diodes are available with well-characterized wide-ranging values of capacitance. A varactor is used to change the capacitance (and hence the frequency) of an LC tank. A varactor can also change loading on a crystal resonator and pull its resonant frequency. 

The same effect occurs with bipolar transistors, as described by Donald E. Thomas at Bell Labs in 1954: with a tank circuit connected to the collector and the modulating audio signal applied between the emitter and the base, a single-transistor FM transmitter is created. Thomas worked with a point-contact transistor, but the effect also works in junction transistors; applications include wireless microphones such as that patented by Raymond A. Litke in 1964.

For low-frequency VCOs, other methods of varying the frequency (such as altering the charging rate of a capacitor by means of a voltage-controlled current source) are used (see function generator).

The frequency of a ring oscillator is controlled by varying either the supply voltage, the current available to each inverter stage, or the capacitive loading on each stage.

===Phase-domain equations===

VCOs are used in analog applications such as frequency modulation and frequency-shift keying. The functional relationship between the control voltage and the output frequency for a VCO (especially those used at radio frequency) may not be linear, but over small ranges, the relationship is approximately linear, and linear control theory can be used. A voltage-to-frequency converter (VFC) is a special type of VCO designed to be very linear over a wide range of input voltages.

Modeling for VCOs is often not concerned with the amplitude or shape (sinewave, triangle wave, sawtooth) but rather its instantaneous phase. In effect, the focus is not on the time-domain signal but rather the argument of the sine function (the phase). Consequently, modeling is often done in the phase domain.

The instantaneous frequency of a VCO is often modeled as a linear relationship with its instantaneous control voltage. The output phase of the oscillator is the integral of the instantaneous frequency.
:formula_1
::* formula_2 is the instantaneous frequency of the oscillator at time (not the waveform amplitude)
::* formula_3 is the quiescent frequency of the oscillator (not the waveform amplitude)
::* formula_4 is called the oscillator sensitivity, or gain. Its units are hertz per volt.
::* formula_5 is the VCO&#x27;s frequency
::* formula_6 is the VCO&#x27;s output phase
::* formula_7 is the time-domain control input or tuning voltage of the VCO

For analyzing a control system, the Laplace transforms of the above signals are useful.
:formula_8

==Design and circuits==
Tuning range, tuning gain and phase noise are the important characteristics of a VCO. Generally, low phase noise is preferred in a VCO. Tuning gain and noise present in the control signal affect the phase noise; high noise or high tuning gain imply more phase noise. Other important elements that determine the phase noise are sources of flicker noise (1/&quot;f&quot; noise) in the circuit, the output power level, and the loaded Q factor of the resonator. (see Leeson&#x27;s equation). The low frequency flicker noise affects the phase noise because the flicker noise is heterodyned to the oscillator output frequency due to the non-linear transfer function of active devices. The effect of flicker noise can be reduced with negative feedback that linearizes the transfer function (for example, emitter degeneration).

VCOs generally have lower Q factor compared to similar fixed-frequency oscillators, and so suffer more jitter. The jitter can be made low enough for many applications (such as driving an ASIC), in which case VCOs enjoy the advantages of having no off-chip components (expensive) or on-chip inductors (low yields on generic CMOS processes).

=== LC oscillators ===
Commonly used VCO circuits are the Clapp and Colpitts oscillators. The more widely used oscillator of the two is Colpitts and these oscillators are very similar in configuration.

=== Crystal oscillators ===
A (VCXO) is used for fine adjustment of the operating frequency. The frequency of a voltage-controlled crystal oscillator can be varied a few tens of parts per million (ppm) over a control voltage range of typically 0 to 3 volts, because the high Q factor of the crystals allows frequency control over only a small range of frequencies.

A (TCVCXO) incorporates components that partially correct the dependence on temperature of the resonant frequency of the crystal. A smaller range of voltage control then suffices to stabilize the oscillator frequency in applications where temperature varies, such as heat buildup inside a transmitter.

Placing the oscillator in a crystal oven at a constant but higher-than-ambient temperature is another way to stabilize oscillator frequency. High stability crystal oscillator references often place the crystal in an oven and use a voltage input for fine control. The temperature is selected to be the &quot;turnover temperature&quot;: the temperature where small changes do not affect the resonance. The control voltage can be used to occasionally adjust the reference frequency to a NIST source. Sophisticated designs may also adjust the control voltage over time to compensate for crystal aging.

===Clock generators===
A clock generator is an oscillator that provides a timing signal to synchronize operations in digital circuits. VCXO clock generators are used in many areas such as digital TV, modems, transmitters and computers. Design parameters for a VCXO clock generator are tuning voltage range, center frequency, frequency tuning range and the timing jitter of the output signal. Jitter is a form of phase noise that must be minimised in applications such as radio receivers, transmitters and measuring equipment.

When a wider selection of clock frequencies is needed the VCXO output can be passed through digital divider circuits to obtain lower frequencies or be fed to a phase-locked loop (PLL). ICs containing both a VCXO (for external crystal) and a PLL are available. A typical application is to provide clock frequencies in a range from 12 kHz to 96 kHz to an audio digital-to-analog converter.

=== Frequency synthesizers===
A frequency synthesizer generates precise and adjustable frequencies based on a stable single-frequency clock. A digitally controlled oscillator based on a frequency synthesizer may serve as a digital alternative to analog voltage controlled oscillator circuits.

== Applications ==

VCOs are used in function generators, phase-locked loops including frequency synthesizers used in communication equipment and the production of electronic music, to generate variable tones in synthesizers.

Function generators are low-frequency oscillators which feature multiple waveforms, typically sine, square, and triangle waves. Monolithic function generators are voltage-controlled.

Analog phase-locked loops typically contain VCOs. High-frequency VCOs are usually used in phase-locked loops for radio receivers. Phase noise is the most important specification in this application.

Audio-frequency VCOs are used in analog music synthesizers. For these, sweep range, linearity, and distortion are often the most important specifications. Audio-frequency VCOs for use in musical contexts were largely superseded in the 1980s by their digital counterparts, digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs), due to their output stability in the face of temperature changes during operation. Since the 1990s, musical software has become the dominant sound-generating method.

Voltage-to-frequency converters are voltage-controlled oscillators with a highly linear relation between applied voltage and frequency. They are used to convert a slow analog signal (such as from a temperature transducer) to a signal suitable for transmission over a long distance, since the frequency will not drift or be affected by noise. Oscillators in this application may have sine or square wave outputs.

Where the oscillator drives equipment that may generate radio-frequency interference, adding a varying voltage to its control input, called , can disperse the interference spectrum to make it less objectionable (see spread spectrum clock).

<text>The Bridge of the Gods was a natural dam created by the Bonneville Slide, a major landslide that dammed the Columbia River near present-day Cascade Locks, Oregon in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The river eventually breached the bridge and washed much of it away, but the event is remembered in local legends of the Native Americans as the &quot;Bridge of the Gods&quot;.


The Bridge of the Gods is also the name of a modern manmade bridge, across the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington.

==Geologic history==
Interpretations of the age of the Bonneville landslide have evolved as more investigators have studied it and as more modern dating techniques have become available. Early work based on dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating suggested the landslide occurred between AD 1060 and 1180 or between 1250 and 1280. The year 1100 has often been cited as the date of the Bonneville landslide. More recent work using radiocarbon dating and lichenometry has suggested dates between 1500 and 1760 or between 1670 and 1760. These younger radiocarbon ages permitted a possible link to the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. However, more recent investigations using radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology show the landslide occurred around 1450, that could be associated with an earlier great earthquake that occurred in the mid-fifteenth century.

The Bonneville landslide sent a large amount of debris south from Table Mountain and Greenleaf Peak, covering more than . The debris slid into the Columbia Gorge close to modern-day Cascade Locks, Oregon, blocking the Columbia River with a natural dam approximately high and long. The impounded river formed a lake and drowned a forest of trees for about . Native Americans might have crossed the river on the dam or, as their oral histories say, a bridge. Although no one knows how long it took, the Columbia River eventually broke through the dam and washed away most of the debris, forming the Cascades Rapids, themselves submerged in 1938 by the construction of the Bonneville Dam. Geologists have determined that debris from several distinct landslides in the same area overlap, forming what is called the Cascades landslide complex. The Bonneville landslide was the most recent, and perhaps the largest landslide of the complex. Studies to understand the nature of the landslide complex and to map the lobes of individual landslide events were undertaken during the 1960s and 1970s. The composite nature of the landslide complex may explain the early discrepancies between date estimates of the Bonneville Landslide.

==Native American legend==
Native American lore contains numerous legends to explain the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. The most famous of these is the Bridge of the Gods legend told by the Klickitats. In their tale, the chief of all the gods, Tyhee Saghalie and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy&#x27;east, traveled down the Columbia River from the Far North in search of a suitable area to settle.

They came upon an area that is now called The Dalles and thought they had never seen a land so beautiful. The sons quarreled over the land and to solve the dispute, their father shot two arrows from his mighty bow; one to the north and the other to the south. Pahto followed the arrow to the north and settled there while Wy&#x27;east did the same for the arrow to the south. Saghalie then built Tanmahawis, the Bridge of the Gods, so his family could meet periodically.

When the two sons of Saghalie both fell in love with a beautiful maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River Gorge.

For punishment, Saghalie struck down each of the lovers and transformed them into great mountains where they fell. Wy&#x27;east, with his head lifted in pride, became the volcano known today as Mount Hood, and Pahto, with his head bent toward his fallen love, was turned into Mount Adams. The fair Loowit became Mount St. Helens, known to the Klickitats as Louwala-Clough which means &quot;smoking or fire mountain&quot; in their language (the Sahaptin called the mountain Loowit).

<text>Leslie Dennis Heseltine (born 12 October 1953) is an English television presenter, actor and comedian. He presented &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; from 1987 to 2002. 

==Early life==
Dennis was born as Leslie Dennis Heseltine on 12 October 1953 in the Liverpool suburb of Garston. His mother worked in a factory while his father, who worked in a betting shop after serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, was listed as a football player on the books of Liverpool FC but did not play for the first team. He lived in the suburb of Speke for a while and attended the Stockton Wood and Joseph Williams primary schools, before going to Morrison Rose Lane Secondary Modern school in Allerton. From 1967 he went to Quarry Bank Comprehensive. Dennis left there in June 1972 with an A-level in Art and failed History and English Literature. He had a weekend job in the men&#x27;s clothing store Burton whilst still at school, and started as a stand-up comedian in working men&#x27;s clubs.

==Career==

===Early work and &quot;Family Fortunes&quot;===
As a comedian, Dennis performed in social clubs all around the northwest of England. He was given the earliest opportunities in his home city of Liverpool; in his autobiography, he later credited husband-and-wife theatrical agents Stuart and Dorene Gillespie (who had themselves been a successful variety act) with discovering him. His debut radio broadcast was in 1971 on Stuart&#x27;s BBC Radio Merseyside series &quot;Variety Time&quot; (the programs were taped in front of a live audience in Merseyside clubs). In 1974, he won the ITV talent show &quot;New Faces&quot; and appeared on numerous light entertainment shows. It&#x27;s a common myth that he almost became the first contestant ever to score the maximum 120 points on &quot;New Faces&quot;, but had to settle for 119 when Tony Hatch gave him 9 out of 10 in his final mark, drawing derision from the rest of a judges&#x27; panel that included fellow Liverpool comedian Arthur Askey. He scored 39 for Presentation, 36 for Content, and 36 for Star Quality, meaning he only scored 111 with the score of 9 out of 10 leaving him one mark short of a maximum in just the Presentation category.

In 1982, Dennis joined as one of the teams on &quot;Russ Abbot&#x27;s Madhouse&quot; and &quot;The Russ Abbot Show&quot; before forming a comedy partnership with fellow impressionist Dustin Gee, which in turn led to a series of their own, &quot;The Laughter Show&quot;. Following Gee&#x27;s sudden and unexpected death in January 1986, Dennis carried on &quot;The Laughter Show&quot; as a solo performer and became the third host of &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; for a 15-year run between 1987 and 2002. It was at a recording of an episode of &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; in 1997 that Dennis was surprised by the BBC programme &quot;&#x27;This Is Your Life&#x27;&quot;.

When a contestant on &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; gave a particularly silly answer to a survey question, Dennis would sometimes say, &quot;If it&#x27;s [the answer] up there, I&#x27;ll give you the money meself!&quot; His Liverpudlian accent famously led him to pronounce &quot;myself&quot; as &quot;meself&quot;, which soon made the sentence his catchphrase. This backfired on an episode where a contestant was asked to &quot;name a way of toasting someone&quot; and the contestant answered &quot;over fire&quot;, which matched with &quot;grill&quot; for £12; according to an anonymous source, Dennis made good on his promise and provided the prize money himself.&quot;

===Theatre===
Dennis&#x27; stage work includes Amos Hart in &quot;Chicago&quot; and Bill Snibson in &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; in the West End. He has starred in &quot;Skylight&quot; at the Water Mill Theatre in Newbury, &quot;Mr Wonderful&quot; at the Gateway Theatre in Chester, and &quot;Misery&quot; at the Coliseum Theatre in Oldham. He also appeared in &quot;Just Between Ourselves&quot; and co-starred alongside Janet Suzman in &quot;Cherished Disappointments in Love&quot; at London&#x27;s Soho Theatre. He co-starred with Christopher Cazenove and John Duttine in a national tour of &quot;&#x27;Art&#x27;&quot; and as Norman Bartholomew in Anthony Shaffer&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Murderer&quot; at London&#x27;s Menier Chocolate Factory. He later starred in a hit season of &quot;Neville&#x27;s Island&quot; at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.

Dennis appeared as Mr. Fulton in &quot;High School Musical 2&quot; on a UK tour from August 2009 to February 2010. He toured in &quot;Hairspray&quot; as Wilbur Turnblad alongside Michael Ball, Brian Conley and Michael Starke – who alternated the role of Edna Turnblad. He starred in the touring production of &quot;Legally Blonde The Musical&quot; in 2012, playing the role of Professor Callahan.

In 2017, Dennis played the role of Uncle Fester on the UK tour of the musical production of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. The production starred Samantha Womack and Carrie Hope Fletcher.

In 2019, Dennis performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Restoration plays &quot;The Provoked Wife&quot; and &quot;Venice Preserved&quot;.

In 2021, Dennis made a return to the theatre when he played the role of Wilbur Turnblad in the 2021 revival of &quot;Hairspray&quot; at the London Coliseum.

In November and December 2021, Dennis performed as Sir Joseph in the English National Opera Performance of &quot;HMS Pinafore&quot; at the London Coliseum.

He had previously made appearances on two episodes of &quot;Bang Bang, It&#x27;s Reeves and Mortimer&quot; in The &quot;Club&quot; sketch, where he played himself. When he took part in a video-only special of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; in 1993, Vic Reeves when introducing him pronounced his name as though it were French, saying &quot;Les Dennis, the French fire engine&quot;.

Dennis has appeared in an episode of &quot;The Bill&quot; in 2006 as Mr. Tom Walker, &quot;Brookside&quot; (as Jeff Evans; 2001) and episodes of &quot;Merseybeat&quot;, &quot;Family Affairs&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, the short-lived revival of &quot;Crossroads&quot;, and &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot;.

===&quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;===
Dennis appeared in the second series of the UK &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; during the period when his marriage to Amanda Holden was breaking down again – he described his time in the BB House as &quot;not one of his wisest moves&quot;, although he went on to finish as runner-up to Mark Owen.

===&quot; Extras&quot;===
On 11 August 2005, Dennis appeared as a guest star in an episode of the first series of BBC sitcom &quot;Extras&quot;, written by and starring Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. In this appearance, Dennis portrayed a fictional version of himself, alongside Gerard Kelly, who played a camp theatre director, the recurring character Bunny. Dennis would go on to say &quot;you could say &quot;Extras&quot; changed my life.&quot;

In early 2006, Dennis presented and performed in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Musicals&quot; and guested in &quot;New Street Law&quot; on BBC One.

In summer 2006, he played scriptwriter Nick Chase in a new comedy play called &quot;Marlon Brando&#x27;s Corset&quot;, which toured the UK from July 2006, including a month-long run at the Edinburgh Fringe.

He appeared as a guest in August 2006 in the ITV drama series &quot;The Bill&quot;, starring as a man suspected of murdering his father. Dennis appeared alongside fellow former &quot;Russ Abbot&quot; performer Lisa Maxwell, who played DI Samantha Nixon in the series.

At the 2006 Edinburgh International Television Festival, it was announced Dennis would make a return to the gameshow genre, presenting a new big-money quiz show titled &quot;In the Grid&quot; for Channel 5. The show debuted on 30 October 2006 and aired for one series. From April 2007, he also hosted UKTV Gold&#x27;s &quot;TV Now and Then&quot; quiz show. The same month he guest-starred on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Holby City&quot;.

In August 2007, he starred in the hit play &quot;Certified Male&quot;—about the highs and lows of modern manhood—at the Edinburgh Festival. He then toured in &quot;The Servant of Two Masters&quot;, directed by Michael Bogdanov and at Christmas he returned to pantomime after a ten-year break, co-starring in &quot;Cinderella&quot; with Hollywood veteran Mickey Rooney at the Empire Theatre, Sunderland, produced by First Family Entertainment.

===2008–2012===

Dennis&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Must The Show Go On?&quot;, was published by Orion in early 2008.

In April 2008, Dennis toured in Eurobeat Almost Eurovision before a West End season in the show. Also in 2008, he narrated &quot;Les Dennis&#x27;s Home Video Heroes&quot;, a home video clip show broadcast on Challenge, and appeared in the ITV documentary &quot;Les Dennis&#x27; Liverpool&quot;, which was, coincidentally, broadcast a week after BBC Two ran &quot;Alexei Sayle&#x27;s Liverpool&quot;, a three-part documentary on the city.

During the Christmas 2008 panto season, Dennis appeared as Buttons in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Empire Theatre, Liverpool. The pantomime also featured Jennifer Ellison as Cinderella, and Cilla Black as the Fairy Godmother.

From August 2012, he performed in the play &quot;Jigsy&quot; at the Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh) as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

===2013–2014===
In 2013 Dennis was reunited with Warwick Davis when the pair joined the cast of the West End production of Monty Python&#x27;s &quot;Spamalot&quot; at London&#x27;s Playhouse Theatre. His next theatrical appearance came in an adaptation of Peter James&#x27; novella &quot;The Perfect Murder&quot;.

In 2013, Dennis was a contestant in &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;. He finished as runner-up to Ade Edmondson. He has since returned to the show as a guest judge.

In December of that year, Dennis appeared in an episode of &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; titled &quot;The Christmas Haunting&quot;.

===2014–2016: &quot;Coronation Street&quot;===

He began filming on 27 January 2014, and made his first appearance on TV on 24 March 2014. The show&#x27;s producer Stuart Blackburn said: &quot;Les is a fantastic performer and a real coup for Corrie. I can&#x27;t wait for him to join the team&quot;.

On 18 November 2016, Dennis&#x27;s character Michael Rodwell was killed off from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, after suffering a heart attack and being left for dead by the show&#x27;s villain, Michael&#x27;s love rival Pat Phelan.

<text>A ushanka (, , from , ), also called a &quot;ushanka-hat&quot; (, ), is a Russian fur hat with ear-covering flaps that can be tied up on the crown of the cap, or fastened at the chin to protect the ears, jaw, and lower chin from the cold. An alternative way to wear is to bend the flaps back and tie them behind the head, which is called &quot;ski-style&quot; — this offers less protection from the elements, but much better visibility, essential for high-speed skiing. The dense fur also offers some protection against blunt impacts to the head. They are also traditionally worn in the Baltic region including Sweden, Finland, Norway and the whole eastern European region.

== Materials ==
Ushanka hats are made from sheepskin (&quot;tsigeyka&quot; or &quot;mouton&quot;), karakul, rabbit, muskrat, mink and many other furs. Artificial fur hats are also manufactured and are referred to as &quot;fish fur&quot; since the material is not from any real animal. The simplest &quot;fish fur&quot; of &quot;ushanka&quot;s was made of wool pile with cloth substrate and cloth top, with the exception of the flaps, which had the pile exposed. Mink fur ushankas are widely used in the Arctic regions of Russia, protecting the ears and chin of the wearer even from &quot;deep frost&quot;, which is around .

== History ==
Hats with fur earflaps have been known for centuries, especially in the Balkan countries Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, as well as in Northeastern Italy, in the Julian March, Trieste, and surrounding areas where there has been a large Slavic population for centuries. Such hats are also seen in Nordic countries Sweden, Norway and Finland, in the Eurasian and European Slavic countries Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Moldova and in Caucasus region in Georgia and Armenia. The design of ushanka with a perfectly round crown was developed in the 17th century when in central and northern Russia a hat with two earflaps and a backflap called (&quot;three-eared&quot;) was worn. The modern ushanka design from 1917 is also inspired by the Norwegian &quot;norvezhka&quot;, a hat which was invented by Norwegian arctic explorers. The main difference from the treukh is that the earflaps of the norvezhka were much longer. In addition, Cossacks of the Kuban have influenced the design of modern Ushanka through interaction with peoples from Central Asia and Caucasus.

In 1917 during the Russian Civil War, the ruler of Siberia, Aleksandr Kolchak, introduced a winter uniform hat, commonly referred to as a &quot;kolchakovka&quot;, c. 1918. It was similar to the ushanka. However, Kolchak and the White Army lost the war, and their headgear was not adopted in the new Soviet Union.

Red Army soldiers instead wore the budenovka, which was made of felt. It was designed to resemble historical bogatyr helmets, and did not provide much protection from the cold.

During the Winter War against Finland, organizational failures and inadequate equipment left many Soviet troops vulnerable to cold, and many died of exposure. The Finnish army had much better equipment including an ushanka-style fur hat, the turkislakki M36 , introduced in 1936. In 1939, shortly before the Winter War, the slightly improved turkislakki M39 was introduced, and is still in use today. After the Winter War, the Red Army received completely redesigned winter uniforms. &quot;Budenovkas&quot; were finally replaced with ushankas based on the Finnish example. Officers were issued fur ushankas; other ranks received ushankas made with plush or &quot;fish fur&quot;. When they experienced the harsh Russian winter, for example during the Battle of Moscow, German soldiers started to wear ushankas and other Soviet-type winter gear, as their uniforms did not provide adequate protection from the extreme cold. 

The ushanka became a symbol and media icon of the Soviet Union and later the Russian Federation. Photographs of U.S. President Gerald Ford wearing the cap during a 1974 visit to the Soviet Union were seen as a possible sign of détente.

== Current use ==

Identified with Soviet rule and issued in all Warsaw Pact armies, the ushanka has since become a part of the winter uniform for military and police forces in Canada and other Western countries with a cold winter. Gray (American civilian police), green (for camouflage), blue (police, United States Coast Guard, and United States Post Office) and black versions are in current usage. In 2013, the Russian army announced that soldiers will get a new ushanka with a rounder crown and small sealable openings in the flaps for wearing headphones. It is also still used by the Polish armed forces. 

The ushanka was used by the East German authorities before German reunification, and remained part of the German police uniform in winter afterwards. In the Finnish Defence Forces, a gray hat is used with M62 uniform and a green one of different design is a part of M91 and M05 winter dress. Armoured troops have a black hat (M92), while generals may wear a white M39 hat. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police use a &quot;regulation hat&quot; (between an ushanka and an aviator hat), made of muskrat fur. This replaced the former Canadian military fur wedge cap. Similar ones are used by Toronto Transit Commission staff during winter.

A similar type of headgear is worn in China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s winter uniform. Featured in an iconic propaganda image of Lei Feng, this type of hat is often called by Chinese &quot;the Lei Feng hat&quot; (雷锋帽, &quot;Lei Feng mao&quot;).

It is claimed that British wartime airmen visiting the Kola Inlet to help to protect the Arctic convoys quickly started to wear ushankas because their own uniform hats were not warm enough, but &quot;kept the ear flaps tied up to the crown as any Russian would, because it was considered unmanly to wear them down.&quot; However, in the Russian military up to this day, the way of wearing the ushanka — up flaps, down flaps or ski-style — is considered a part of uniform of the day and is usually decided by a unit commander at reveille.

== Similar hats ==
Trapper hats are &quot;a sort of hybrid between the aviator cap and the ushanka—they combine the style of the former with the furriness of the latter&quot;. They are considered more casual than the military-derived ushanka.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police use muskrat ushankas.

Traditional Finnish &quot;Koivistolainen&quot; flat-topped fur hat, which originates from the (now: Primorsk, Leningrad Oblast, Russia) region in the Karelian Isthmus.

<text>This list of games for the TurboGrafx-16, known as the PC Engine outside North America, covers  commercial releases spanning the system&#x27;s launch on October 10, 1987, until June 3, 1999. It is a home video game console created by NEC, released in Japan as the PC Engine in 1987 and North America as the TurboGrafx-16 in 1989.

==Classification==
Listed here are games released commercially for the console between its launch on October 10, 1987, until June 3, 1999. This includes the TurboGrafx-16 in North America and the PC Engine in Japan. About 121 of those games are localized from the PC Engine library, 18 of those games are exclusive to the U.S. market, and the remainder are exclusive to Japan.

TurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine games were released in two types of storage formats, HuCards (also known as TurboChips) and CD-ROMs, with varying level of compatibility depending on the hardware configurations and options available. Specifically, there are two types of HuCard formats (the standard HuCards that comprised the majority of the PC Engine&#x27;s library and a few games that are playable only on the PC Engine SuperGrafx) and three types of CD-ROM formats (CD-ROM², Super CD-ROM², and Arcade CD-ROM², each requiring the console to be equipped with a CD drive and the corresponding System Card if needed). There were also dual-compatible games that were designed to run in an older hardware specifications, but are programmed to take advantage of a newer one (such as reduced loading times). Out of the 389 games that were released on CD-ROM² formats, only 45 were released in North America. 213 games supported multiplayer options through the Turbotap, yet only 51 of these games were released in North America.

<doc id="599590" wikidata="Q1631510" url="?curid=599590" title="PDF417">
<text>PDF417 is a stacked linear barcode format used in a variety of applications such as transport, identification cards, and inventory management. &quot;PDF&quot; stands for Portable Data File. The &quot;417&quot; signifies that each pattern in the code consists of 4 bars and spaces in a pattern that is 17 units (modules) long. The PDF417 symbology was invented by Dr. Ynjiun P. Wang at Symbol Technologies in 1991. It is defined in ISO 15438.

==Applications==

PDF417 is used in many applications by both commercial and government organizations. PDF417 is one of the formats (along with Data Matrix) that can be used to print postage accepted by the United States Postal Service. PDF417 is also used by the airline industry&#x27;s Bar Coded Boarding Pass (BCBP) standard as the 2D bar code symbolism for paper boarding passes. PDF417 is the standard selected by the Department of Homeland Security as the machine readable zone technology for RealID compliant driver licenses and state issued identification cards. PDF417 barcodes are also included on visas and border crossing cards issued by the State of Israel (example).

== Features ==
In addition to features typical of two dimensional bar codes, PDF417&#x27;s capabilities include:

* Linking. PDF417 symbols can link to other symbols which are scanned in sequence allowing even more data to be stored.
* User-specified dimensions. The user can decide how wide the narrowest vertical bar (X dimension) is, and how tall the rows are (Y dimension).
* Public domain format. Anyone can implement systems using this format without any license.

The introduction of the ISO/IEC document states:
::Manufacturers of bar code equipment and users of bar code technology require publicly available standard symbology specifications to which they can refer when developing equipment and application standards. It is the intent and understanding of ISO/IEC that the symbology presented in this International Standard is entirely in the public domain and free of all user restrictions, licences and fees.

==Format==

The PDF417 bar code (also called a symbol) consists of 3 to 90 rows, each of which is like a small linear bar code. Each row has:
* a quiet zone. This is a mandated minimum amount of white space before the bar code begins.
* a start pattern which identifies the format as PDF417.
* a &quot;row left&quot; codeword containing information about the row (such as the row number and error correction level)
* 1–30 data codewords: Codewords are a group of bars and spaces representing one or more numbers, letters, or other symbols.
* a &quot;row right&quot; codeword with more information about the row.
* a stop pattern.
* another quiet zone.

All rows are the same width; each row has the same number of codewords.

===Codewords===
PDF417 uses a base 929 encoding. Each codeword represents a number from 0 to 928.

The codewords are represented by patterns of dark (bar) and light (space) regions. Each of these patterns contains four bars and four spaces (where the 4 in the name comes from). The total width is 17 times the width of the narrowest allowed vertical bar (the X dimension); this is where the 17 in the name comes from. Each pattern starts with a bar and ends with a space.

The row height must be at least 3 times the minimum width: Y ≥ 3 X.

There are three distinct bar–space patterns used to represent each codeword. These patterns are organized into three groups known as clusters. The clusters are labeled 0, 3, and 6. No bar–space pattern is used in more than one cluster. The rows of the symbol cycle through the three clusters, so row 1 uses patterns from cluster 0, row 2 uses cluster 3, row 3 uses cluster 6, and row 4 again uses cluster 0.

Which cluster can be determined by an equation:
:formula_1

Where &quot;K&quot; is the cluster number and the &quot;bi&quot; refer to the width of the &quot;i&quot;-th black bar in the symbol character (in &quot;X&quot; units).

Alternatively,
:formula_2

Where &quot;Ei&quot; is the &quot;i&quot;-th edge-to-next-same-edge distance. Odd indices are the leading edge of a bar to the leading edge of the next bar; even indices are for the trailing edges.

One purpose of the three clusters is to determine which row (mod 3) the codeword is in. The clusters allow portions of the symbol to be read using a single scan line that may be skewed from the horizontal. For instance, the scan might start on row 6 at the start of the row but end on row 10. At the beginning of the scan, the scanner sees the constant start pattern, and then it sees symbols in cluster 6. When the skewed scan straddles rows 6 and 7, then the scanner sees noise. When the scan is on row 7, the scanner sees symbols in cluster 0. Consequently, the scanner knows the direction of the skew. By the time the scanner reaches the right, it is on row 10, so it sees cluster 0 patterns. The scanner will also see a constant stop pattern.

===Encoding===
Of the 929 available code words, 900 are used for data, and 29 for special functions, such as shifting between major modes. The three major modes encode different types of data in different ways, and can be mixed as necessary within a single bar code:
*Byte: each group of 5 code words represents 6 bytes. (Because 9005 &gt; 2566.) Additional bytes are encoded one per code word.
*Numeric: &quot;n&quot; digits are encoded in +1 code words, up to a maximum of 44 digits in 15 code words.
*Text: Each code word represents two base-30 digits, which are used by a system of four submodes to represent the printable ASCII characters (plus CR, LF and HT):
** Uppercase: A–Z, SP, Change to lowercase, Change to mixed, Interpret next digit as punctuation
** Lowercase: a–z, SP, Interpret next digit as uppercase, Change to mixed, Interpret next digit as punctuation
** Mixed: 0–9, &amp;, CR, HT, comma, :, #, -, period, $, /, +, %, *, =, ^, Change to punctuation, SP, Change to lowercase, Change to uppercase, Interpret next digit as punctuation
** Punctuation: ;, &lt;, &gt;, @, [, \, ], _, `, ~, !, CR, HT, comma, :, LF, -, period, $, /, &quot;, |, *, (, ), ?, {, }, &#x27;, Change to uppercase

===Error correction===
When the PDF417 symbol is created, from 2 to 512 error detection and correction codewords are added. PDF417 uses Reed–Solomon error correction. When the symbol is scanned, the maximum number of corrections that can be made is equal to the number of codewords added, but the standard recommends that two codewords be held back to ensure reliability of the corrected information.

==Comparison with other symbologies==
PDF417 is a stacked barcode that can be read with a simple linear scan being swept over the symbol. Those linear scans need the left and right columns with the start and stop code words. Additionally, the scan needs to know what row it is scanning, so each row of the symbol must also encode its row number. Furthermore, the reader&#x27;s line scan won&#x27;t scan just a row; it will typically start scanning one row, but then cross over to a neighbor and possibly continuing on to cross successive rows. In order to minimize the effect of these crossings, the PDF417 modules are tall and narrow — the height is typically three times the width. Also, each code word must indicate which row it belongs to so crossovers, when they occur, can be detected. The code words are also designed to be delta-decodable, so some code words are redundant. Each PDF data code word represents about 10 bits of information (log2(900) ≈ 9.8), but the printed code word (character) is 17 modules wide. Including a height of 3 modules, a PDF417 code word takes 51 square modules to represent 10 bits. That area does not count other overhead such as the start, stop, row, format, and ECC information.

Other 2D codes, such as DataMatrix and QR, are decoded with image sensors instead of uncoordinated linear scans. Those codes still need recognition and alignment patterns, but they do not need to be as prominent. An 8 bit code word will take 8 square modules (ignoring recognition, alignment, format, and ECC information).

In practice, a PDF417 symbol takes about four times the area of a DataMatrix or QR Code.

<text>Rachel Boston is an American actress. She has had leading roles in a number of independent films, and was a regular cast member in several television series. She starred in the NBC drama series, &quot;American Dreams&quot; as Beth Mason from 2002 to 2005, in the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;The Ex List&quot; in 2008, and on the USA Network series &quot;In Plain Sight&quot; from 2011 to 2012. From 2013 to 2014, Boston starred as Ingrid Beauchamp in the Lifetime fantasy-drama series, &quot;Witches of East End&quot;.

==Early life==
Boston was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to William Terry Boston and Brenda Billingsley Boston. Her father was executive vice president of power system operations for the Tennessee Valley Authority. She grew up in Signal Mountain, Tennessee, before moving to New York City at the age of seventeen to attend New York University. She was Miss Tennessee Teen USA in 1999, placing in the Top 10 at the national pageant.

==Career==
Boston starred in the NBC series &quot;American Dreams&quot;, which aired from 2002 to 2005. She portrayed the character Beth Pryor (née Mason), the wife of the oldest son of the Pryor family, around whom the series was centered. She has made guest appearances in other series such as &quot;The Closer&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;, and &quot;Crossing Jordan,&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;.

Boston landed the lead role on ABC&#x27;s Ric Swartzlander comedy pilot &quot;The News&quot; (2007). The show was set in a chaotic Phoenix television newsroom. Boston played a rising star at the station who had recently been promoted to executive producer of all news programs. Boston also starred with Donal Logue in the Fox pilot &quot;Hackett&quot;, directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, and starred with Ed O&#x27;Neill and Christine Baranski in the CBS pilot &quot;Inseparable&quot;.

Boston starred as Daphne Bloom in the short-lived CBS series &quot;The Ex List&quot;. In that same year she also guest starred on NBC&#x27;s &quot;ER&quot; playing an American soldier. She filmed &quot;Ghosts of Girlfriends Past&quot; with Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Garner in February 2008. She has also filmed &quot;500 Days of Summer&quot; with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel in spring 2008.

In early 2011, Boston joined the cast of USA Network&#x27;s hit series &quot;In Plain Sight&quot;, where she played Abigail Chaffee, an Albuquerque Police Detective and the love interest of Marshall Mann (Frederick Weller). For the fifth and final season, Boston continued her role as a series regular.

For her role opposite Noah Bean in the independent feature &quot;The Pill&quot;, Boston garnered rave reviews on the festival circuit and earned accolades including the Best Actress Award from the San Diego Film Festival, the Stargazer Award from the Gen Art Film Festival, and the Emerging Artist Award from the Big Apple Film Festival.

Boston was the executive producer for the independent film &quot;Black Marigolds&quot;, and also starred in the film, which reunited her with her costar from &quot;The Pill&quot;, Noah Bean. The film was shot over a two-week span in the Palomar Mountain Range of Southern California.

In 2012, Boston starred in the feature film &quot;It&#x27;s a Disaster&quot; alongside Julia Stiles and America Ferrera. Also in 2012, Boston would then be cast as one of the leads in the Lifetime fantasy-drama series &quot;Witches of East End&quot;, based on a novel of the same name by Melissa de la Cruz, opposite Julia Ormond, Jenna Dewan and Mädchen Amick. The show debuted on October 6, 2013.

During her tenure on &quot;Witches of East End&quot;, she was cast in the original independent romantic comedy &quot;A Ring by Spring&quot;, a &quot;Hallmark&quot; original film, directed by Kristoffer Tabori. Shortly thereafter she was cast in Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries&#x27; original telefilm &quot;A Gift of Miracles&quot;, opposite Jesse Moss and Rita Moreno.

Shortly after Lifetime&#x27;s cancellation of &quot;Witches of East End&quot;, Boston signed on to Hallmark Channel&#x27;s original telefim, &quot;Ice Sculpture Christmas&quot;, a part of Hallmark&#x27;s 2015 Countdown to Christmas event. In April 2016, Boston completed work on &quot;Hallmark Channel&quot;&#x27;s original telefilm &quot;Stop the Wedding&quot;, co-starring Niall Matter, Alan Thicke, Lini Evans and Teryl Rothery. At the end of 2016, Boston announced a partnership with &quot;Hallmark&quot; and author de la Cruz on a new original movie, &quot;Christmas in Angel Falls&quot;, about an angel who falls in love during the Christmas season.

Between 2018 and 2019, Boston would sign on to her first theatrical leading role in six years, in the film &quot;I Hate Kids&quot; opposite Tom Everett Scott. In November 2018, Boston would guest on the ABC drama the Good Doctor as Claire&#x27;s college roommate and friend, Kayla, who is seeking treatment for her cancer.

==Personal life==
Boston and professional chef Tolya Ashe were engaged June 16, 2021. In January 2022 she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, a baby girl named Grace.

<text>The Ekavyāvahārika (; ) was one of the early Buddhist schools, and is thought to have separated from the Mahāsāṃghika sect during the reign of Aśoka.

==History==

===Relationship to Mahāsāṃghika===
Tāranātha viewed the Ekavyāvahārikas, Lokottaravādins, and Gokulikas as being essentially the same. He even viewed &quot;Ekavyāvahārika&quot; as being a general term for the Mahāsāṃghikas. The Ekavyāvahārikas, Gokulikas, and Lokottaravādins are the three groups that emerged from the first split in the Mahāsāṃghika sect. A.K. Warder notes that the Ekavyāvahārikas were hardly known in later times and may have simply have been considered part of the Mahāsāṃghika.

===Early history===
The 6th century CE Indian monk Paramārtha wrote that 200 years after the parinirvāṇa of the Buddha, much of the Mahāsāṃghika school moved north of Rājagṛha, and were divided over whether the Mahāyāna teachings should be incorporated formally into their Tripiṭaka. According to this account, they split into three groups based upon the relative manner and degree to which they accepted the authority of these Mahāyāna texts. According to Paramārtha, the Ekavyāvahārikas accepted the Mahāyāna sūtras as the words of the Buddha (&quot;buddhavacana&quot;).

==Doctrines==
===Forty-eight theses===
The &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot; of Vasumitra regards the Ekavyāvahārikas, Gokulikas, and Lokottaravādins as being doctrinally indistinguishable. According to Vasumitra, 48 theses were held in common by these three Mahāsāṃghika sects. Of the 48 special theses attributed by the &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot; to these sects, 20 points concern the supramundane nature of buddhas and bodhisattvas. According to the &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot;, these four groups held that the Buddha is able to know all &quot;dharmas&quot; in a single moment of the mind. Yao Zhihua writes:

===Trascendent speech===
The name of the Ekavyāvahārikas refers to their doctrine that the Buddha speaks with a single and unified transcendent meaning. They emphasized the transcendence of the Buddha, asserting that he was eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical. Just as the words of the Buddha were held to be spoken with one transcendent meaning, the Four Noble Truths were understood to be perfectly realized with one wisdom.

===Fundamentally pure mind===
The Ekavyāvahārikas held that sentient beings possessed an originally or fundamentally pure mind, but that it has been encumbered and obscured by suffering. This conception of the nature of the mind as being fundamentally the same as that of the Buddha, has been identified with the Mahāyāna doctrines of Buddha-nature and the Buddha&#x27;s Dharmakāya, as well as compared favorably with doctrines in Mahāyāna sūtras such as the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;&quot;.

<text>Peter Taaffe (born April 1942) is a British Marxist Trotskyist political activist and former leader of the Socialist Party. 

Taaffe was the founding editor of the Trotskyist &quot;Militant&quot; newspaper in 1964, and became known as a leading member of the entryist Militant group. Taaffe was expelled from the Labour Party in 1983, along with four other members of &quot;Militant&quot;&#x27;s editorial board.

Taaffe was influential in the policy decisions of Liverpool City Council of 1983–1987, according to the council&#x27;s deputy leader Derek Hatton, and in the formation of the Militant tendency&#x27;s policy regarding the Poll Tax in 1988–1991. 

== Early life ==
Taaffe was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, one of six children of a sheet metal worker. He was recruited to what would become the Militant tendency in 1960 by Ted Grant.

== Liverpool City Council under Militant ==
In the four-year Liverpool struggle, Taaffe was closely involved with developments, discussing with close friends and leading Liverpool Militant supporters, such as the former print worker Tony Mulhearn.

<text>The Kukkuṭika (Sanskrit; ) were an early Buddhist school which descended from the Mahāsāṃghika.

==Etymology==
It is likely that the name &quot;Kukkuṭika&quot; or &quot;Kukkulika&quot; originated from the Kukkuṭrārāma monastery at Pāṭaliputra, which was an early centre for the Mahāsāṃghikas.

There were numerous variations of this name, such as &quot;Kukkuṭika&quot;, &quot;Kukkulika&quot;, &quot;Kaukkuṭika&quot;, &quot;Kaurukullaka&quot;, and &quot;Gokulika&quot;.

The name &quot;Gokulika&quot; means &quot;cinder&quot;, and refers to the doctrine that all conditioned phenomena necessarily involve suffering, and that they are like an &quot;inferno of ashes.&quot;

==Doctrines==
The &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot; of Vasumitra regards the Ekavyāvahārika, Kukkuṭika, and Lokottaravāda as being doctrinally indistinguishable. According to Vasumitra, 48 theses were held in common by these three Mahāsāṃghika sects. Of these 48 special theses, 20 points concern the supramundane nature of buddhas and bodhisattvas. According to the &quot;Samayabhedoparacanacakra&quot;, these four groups held that the Buddha is able to know all &quot;dharmas&quot; in a single moment of the mind. Yao Zhihua writes:

==History==
The Kukkuṭika sect is believed to have split from the main Mahāsāṃghika sect during the reign of Aśoka utilising early Buddha chronology, and the late second century BCE utilising late Buddha chronology. The Bahuśrutīya and Prajñaptivāda are thought to have split from the Kukkuṭikas in the late third or second century BCE. The Kukkuṭikas seem to have remained in eastern India, and remained strongest in the area around Vārāṇasī.

The sixth-century Indian monk Paramārtha associates the initial composition and acceptance of Mahāyāna sūtras with the Mahāsāṃghika branch of Buddhism. He wrote that the Mahāsāṃghikas initially split into three groups based upon the relative manner and degree to which they accepted the authority of Mahayana teachings. Paramārtha states that at this time, the Kukkuṭika sect did not accept the Mahāyāna sūtras as &quot;buddhavacana&quot; (&quot;words of the Buddha&quot;), while the Lokottaravāda sect and the Ekavyāvahārika sect did accept the Mahāyāna sūtras as &quot;buddhavacana&quot;.

In the early fifth century, the Chinese monk Faxian procured a copy of the Mahāsāṃghika vinaya from a monastery in Pāṭaliputra that he describes as &quot;Mahāyāna&quot;. The Kukkuṭikas were a Mahāsāṃghika sect known to exist in Pāṭaliputra, even having alternate names linking them to the Kukkuṭrārāma monastery there.

According to Tāranātha, this school disappeared between the fourth and ninth centuries. In his eighth-century account of the various contemporary Buddhist sects, Vinitadeva does not mention Kukkuṭika. It is possible that this sect had merged completely into Mahāyāna Buddhism by this time.

<doc id="599614" wikidata="Q1242622" url="?curid=599614" title="Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia">
<text>The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia or the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis is a model that attributes the positive symptoms of schizophrenia to a disturbed and hyperactive dopaminergic signal transduction. The model draws evidence from the observation that a large number of antipsychotics have dopamine-receptor antagonistic effects. The theory, however, does not posit dopamine overabundance as a complete explanation for schizophrenia. Rather, the overactivation of D2 receptors, specifically, is one effect of the global chemical synaptic dysregulation observed in this disorder.

== Introduction ==
Some researchers have suggested that dopamine systems in the mesolimbic pathway may contribute to the &#x27;positive symptoms&#x27; of schizophrenia, whereas problems concerning dopamine function within the mesocortical pathway may be responsible for the &#x27;negative symptoms&#x27;, such as avolition and alogia. Abnormal expression, thus distribution of the D2 receptor between these areas and the rest of the brain may also be implicated in schizophrenia, specifically in the acute phase. A relative excess of these receptors within the limbic system means Broca&#x27;s area, which can produce illogical language, has an abnormal connection to Wernicke&#x27;s area, which comprehends language but does not create it. Note that variation in distribution is observed within individuals, so abnormalities of this characteristic likely play a significant role in all psychological illnesses. Individual alterations are produced by differences within glutamatergic pathways within the limbic system, which are also implicated in other psychotic syndromes. Among the alterations of both synaptic and global structure, the most significant abnormalities are observed in the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulate cortex. The combination of these creates a profound dissymmetry of prefrontal inhibitory signaling, shifted positively towards the dominant side. Eventually, the cingulate gyrus becomes atrophied towards the anterior, due to long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) from the abnormally strong signals transversely across the brain. This, combined with a relative deficit in GABAergic input to Wernicke&#x27;s area, shifts the balance of bilateral communication across the corpus callosum posteriorly. Through this mechanism, hemispherical communication becomes highly shifted towards the left/dominant posterior. As such, spontaneous language from Broca&#x27;s can propagate through the limbic system to the tertiary auditory cortex. This retrograde signaling to the temporal lobes that results in the parietal lobes not recognizing it as internal results in the auditory hallucinations typical of chronic schizophrenia.

Significant cortical grey matter volume reductions are observed in this disorder. Specifically, the right hemisphere atrophies more, while both sides show a marked decrease in frontal and posterior volume. This indicates that abnormal synaptic plasticity occurs, where certain feedback loops become so potentiated, others receive little glutaminergic transmission. This is a direct result of the abnormal dopaminergic input to the striatum, thus (indirectly) disinhibition of thalamic activity. The excitatory nature of dopaminergic transmission means the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia is inextricably intertwined with this altered functioning. 5-HT also regulates monoamine neurotransmitters, including dopaminergic transmission. Specifically, the 5-HT2A receptor regulates cortical input to the basal ganglia and many typical and atypical antipsychotics are antagonists at this receptor. Several antipsychotics are also antagonists at the 5-HT2C receptor, leading to dopamine release in the structures where 5-HT2C is expressed; striatum, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus (all structures indicated in this disease), and currently thought to be a reason why antipsychotics with 5HT2C antagonistic properties improves negative symptoms. More research is needed to explain the exact nature of the altered chemical transmission in this disorder.
Recent evidence on a variety of animal models of psychosis, such as sensitization of animal behaviour by amphetamine, or phencyclidine (PCP, Angel Dust), or excess steroids, or by removing various genes (COMT, DBH, GPRK6, RGS9, RIIbeta), or making brain lesions in newborn animals, or delivering animals abnormally by Caesarian section, all induce a marked behavioural supersensitivity to dopamine and a marked rise in the number of dopamine D2 receptors in the high-affinity state for dopamine.
This latter work implies that there are multiple genes and neuronal pathways that can lead to psychosis and that all these multiple psychosis pathways converge via the high-affinity state of the D2 receptor, the common target for all antipsychotics, typical or atypical. Combined with less inhibitory signalling from the thalamus and other basal ganglic structures, from atrophy the abnormal activation of the cingulate cortex, specifically around Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s areas, abnormal D2 agonism can facilitate the self-reinforcing, illogical patterns of language found in such patients. In schizophrenia, this feedback loop has progressed, which produced the widespread neural atrophy characteristic of this disease. Patients on neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication have significantly less atrophy within these crucial areas. As such, early medical intervention is crucial in preventing the advancement of these profound deficits in bilateral communication at the root of all psychotic disorders. Advanced, chronic schizophrenia can not respond even to clozapine, regarded as the most effective antipsychotic, as such, a cure for highly advanced schizophrenia is likely impossible through the use of any modern antipsychotics, so the value of early intervention cannot be stressed enough.

== Discussion ==
=== Evidence for the dopamine hypothesis ===
Stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine increase the levels of dopamine in the synaptic space and exacerbate acute psychotic episodes in schizophrenic patients. It should be noted, however, that this does not occur when patients with schizophrenia are not in an acute psychotic state. In fact, low-dose amphetamine (10 mg) has been shown to improve auditory discrimination training in patients with schizophrenia. Repeated, high doses of amphetamine are neurotoxic to dopamine neurons, and can cause a psychotic syndrome resembling schizophrenia. Similarly, those treated with dopamine enhancing levodopa for Parkinson&#x27;s disease can experience psychotic side effects mimicking the symptoms of schizophrenia. Up to 75% of patients with schizophrenia have increased signs and symptoms of their psychosis upon challenge with moderate doses of methylphenidate or amphetamine or other dopamine-like compounds, all given at doses at which control normal volunteers do not have any psychologically disturbing effects.

Some functional neuroimaging studies have also shown that, after taking amphetamine, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia show greater levels of dopamine release (particularly in the striatum) than non-psychotic individuals. However, the acute effects of dopamine stimulants include euphoria, alertness and over-confidence; these symptoms are more reminiscent of mania than schizophrenia. Since the 2000s, several PET studies have confirmed an altered synthesis capacity of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system demonstrating a dopaminergic dysregulation.

A group of drugs called the phenothiazines, including antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, has been found to antagonize dopamine binding (particularly at receptors known as D2 dopamine receptors) and reduce positive psychotic symptoms. This observation was subsequently extended to other antipsychotic drug classes, such as butyrophenones including haloperidol. The link was strengthened by experiments in the 1970s which suggested that the binding affinity of antipsychotic drugs for D2 dopamine receptors seemed to be inversely proportional to their therapeutic dose. This correlation, suggesting that receptor binding is causally related to therapeutic potency, was reported by two laboratories in 1976.

People with Schizophrenia appear to have a high rate of self-medication with nicotine; the therapeutic effect likely occurs through dopamine modulation by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

However, there was controversy and conflicting findings over whether postmortem findings resulted from drug tolerance to chronic antipsychotic treatment. Compared to the success of postmortem studies in finding profound changes of dopamine receptors, imaging studies using SPECT and PET methods in drug naive patients have generally failed to find any difference in dopamine D2 receptor density compared to controls. Comparable findings in longitudinal studies show: &quot;Particular emphasis is given to methodological limitations in the existing literature, including lack of reliability data, clinical heterogeneity among studies, and inadequate study designs and statistic,&quot; suggestions are made for improving future longitudinal neuroimaging studies of treatment effects in schizophrenia A recent review of imaging studies in schizophrenia shows confidence in the techniques, while discussing such operator error. In 2007 one report said, &quot;During the last decade, results of brain imaging studies by use of PET and SPECT in schizophrenic patients showed a clear dysregulation of the dopaminergic system.&quot;

Recent findings from meta-analyses suggest that there may be a small elevation in dopamine D2 receptors in drug-free patients with schizophrenia, but the degree of overlap between patients and controls makes it unlikely that this is clinically meaningful. While the review by Laruelle acknowledged more sites were found using methylspiperone, it discussed the theoretical reasons behind such an increase (including the monomer-dimer equilibrium) and called for more work to be done to &#x27;characterise&#x27; the differences. In addition, newer antipsychotic medication (called atypical antipsychotic medication) can be as potent as older medication (called typical antipsychotic medication) while also affecting serotonin function and having somewhat less of a dopamine blocking effect. In addition, dopamine pathway dysfunction has not been reliably shown to correlate with symptom onset or severity. HVA levels correlate trendwise to symptoms severity. During the application of debrisoquin, this correlation becomes significant.

Giving a more precise explanation of this discrepancy in D2 receptor has been attempted by a significant minority. Radioligand imaging measurements involve the monomer and dimer ratio, and the &#x27;cooperativity&#x27; model. Cooperativity is a chemical function in the study of enzymes. Dopamine receptors interact with their own kind, or other receptors to form higher order receptors such as dimers, via the mechanism of cooperativity. Philip Seeman has said: &quot;In schizophrenia, therefore, the density of [11C] methylspiperone sites rises, reflecting an increase in monomers, while the density of [11C] raclopride sites remains the same, indicating that the total population of D2 monomers and dimers does not change.&quot; (In another place Seeman has said methylspiperone possibly binds with dimers) With this difference in measurement technique in mind, the above-mentioned meta-analysis uses results from 10 different ligands. Exaggerated ligand binding results such as SDZ GLC 756 (as used in the figure) were explained by reference to this monomer-dimer equilibrium.

According to Seeman, &quot;...Numerous postmortem studies have consistently revealed D2 receptors to be elevated in the striata of patients with schizophrenia&quot;. However, the authors were concerned the effect of medication may not have been fully accounted for. The study introduced an experiment by Anissa Abi-Dargham et al. in which it was shown medication-free live people with schizophrenia had more D2 receptors involved in the schizophrenic process and more dopamine. Since then another study has shown such elevated percentages in D2 receptors is brain-wide (using a different ligand, which did not need dopamine depletion). In a 2009 study, Abi-Dargham &quot;et al&quot;. confirmed the findings of her previous study regarding increased baseline D2 receptors in people with schizophrenia and showing a correlation between this magnitude and the result of amphetamine stimulation experiments.

Some animal models of psychosis are similar to those for addiction – displaying increased locomotor activity. For those female animals with previous sexual experience, amphetamine stimulation happens faster than for virgins. There is no study on male equivalent because the studies are meant to explain why females experience addiction earlier than males.

Even in 1986 the effect of antipsychotics on receptor measurement was controversial. An article in &quot;Science&quot; sought to clarify whether the increase was solely due to medication by using drug-naive people with schizophrenia: &quot;The finding that D2 dopamine receptors are substantially increased in schizophrenic patients who have never been treated with neuroleptic drugs raises the possibility that dopamine receptors are involved in the schizophrenic disease process itself. Alternatively, the increased D2 receptor number may reflect presynaptic factors such as increased endogenous dopamine levels (16). In either case, our findings support the hypothesis that dopamine receptor abnormalities are present in untreated schizophrenic patients.&quot; (The experiment used 3-N-[11C]methylspiperone – the same as mentioned by Seeman detects D2 monomers and binding was double that of controls.)

It is still thought that dopamine mesolimbic pathways may be hyperactive, resulting in hyperstimulation of D2 receptors and positive symptoms. There is also growing evidence that, conversely, mesocortical pathway dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex might be hypoactive (underactive), resulting in hypostimulation of D1 receptors, which may be related to negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. The overactivity and underactivity in these different regions may be linked, and may not be due to a primary dysfunction of dopamine systems but to more general neurodevelopmental issues that precede them. Increased dopamine sensitivity may be a common final pathway. Gründer and Cumming assert that of those living with schizophrenia and other dopaminergic related illnesses, up to 25% of these patients may appear to have dopaminergic markers within the normal range.

Another finding is a six-fold excess of binding sites insensitive to the testing agent, raclopride; Seeman said this increase was probably due to the increase in D2 monomers. Such an increase in monomers may occur via the cooperativity mechanism which is responsible for D2High and D2Low, the supersensitive and lowsensitivity states of the D2 dopamine receptor. More specifically, &quot;an increase in monomers, may be one basis for dopamine supersensitivity&quot;.

=== Genetic and other biopsychosocial risk factors ===
Genetic evidence has suggested that there may be genes, or specific variants of genes, that code for mechanisms involved in dopamine function, which may be more prevalent in people experiencing psychosis or diagnosed with schizophrenia. Genome-Wide Association studies identify frequently seen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that are associated with psychosis. Genetic variants found due to GWA studies may offer insight concerning impairments in dopaminergic function. Dopamine-related genes linked to psychosis in this way include COMT, DRD4, and AKT1.

While genetics play an important role in the occurrence of schizophrenia, other biopsychosocial factors must also be taken into consideration. While focusing on the risk of schizophrenia in second generation migrants, Hennsler and colleagues relay that the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia may be an explanation. Some migrants who have had adverse experiences in their host country, such as racism, xenophobia, and poor living conditions, were found to have high stress levels, which increased dopaminergic neurotransmission. This increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission can be seen in the striatum and amygdala, both of which are areas in the brain that process aversive stimuli.

=== Evidence against the dopamine hypothesis ===
Further experiments, conducted as new methods were developed (particularly the ability to use PET scanning to examine drug action in the brain of living patients) challenged the view that the amount of dopamine blocking was correlated with clinical benefit. These studies showed that some patients had over 90% of their D2 receptors blocked by antipsychotic drugs, but showed little reduction in their psychoses. This primarily occurs in patients who have had the psychosis for ten to thirty years. At least 90-95% of first-episode patients, however, respond to antipsychotics at low doses and do so with D2 occupancy of 60-70%. The antipsychotic aripiprazole occupies over 90% of D2 receptors, but this drug is both an agonist and an antagonist at D2 receptors.

Furthermore, although dopamine-inhibiting medications modify dopamine levels within minutes, the associated improvement in patient symptoms is usually not visible for at least several days, suggesting that dopamine may be indirectly responsible for the illness.

Similarly, the second generation of antipsychotic drugs – the atypical antipsychotics – were found to be just as effective as older typical antipsychotics in controlling psychosis, but more effective in controlling the negative symptoms, despite the fact that they have lower affinity for dopamine receptors than for various other neurotransmitter receptors. More recent work, however, has shown that atypical antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and quetiapine bind and unbind rapidly and repeatedly to the dopamine D2 receptor. All of these drugs exhibit inverse agonistic effects at the 5-HT2A/2C receptors, meaning serotonin abnormalities are also involved in the complex constellation of neurologic factors predisposing one to the self reinforcing language-based psychological deficits found in all forms of psychosis.

The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is now also thought to be associated with schizophrenia. Phencyclidine (also known as PCP or &quot;Angel Dust&quot;) and ketamine, both of which block glutamate (NMDA) receptors, are known to cause psychosis at least somewhat resembling schizophrenia, further suggesting that psychosis and perhaps schizophrenia cannot fully be explained in terms of dopamine function, but may also involve other neurotransmitters.

Similarly, there is now evidence to suggest there may be a number of functional and structural anomalies in the brains of some people diagnosed with schizophrenia, such as changes in grey matter density in the frontal and temporal lobes. It appears, therefore, that there are multiple causes for psychosis and schizophrenia, including gene mutations and anatomical lesions. Many argue that other theories concerning the cause of schizophrenia may be more reliable in some cases, such as the glutamate hypothesis, GABA hypothesis, dysconnection hypothesis, and Bayesian inference hypothesis.

Psychiatrist David Healy has argued that drug companies have inappropriately promoted the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia as a deliberate and calculated simplification for the benefit of drug marketing. Healy, Joanna Moncrieff, and certain other researchers have argued that antipsychotics do not actually treat psychosis but rather simply blunt one&#x27;s emotions and induce a state of psychological indifference. This in turn reduces the behavioral agitation associated with delusions. Moncrieff reviewed the evidence for the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia in 2009 and concluded that the data do not support it.

=== Relationship with glutamate ===
Research has shown the importance of glutamate receptors, specifically N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), in addition to dopamine in the etiology of schizophrenia. Abnormal NMDAR transmission may alter communication between cortical regions and the striatum. Mice with only 5% of the normal levels of NMDAR&#x27;s expressed schizophrenic-like behaviors seen in animal models of schizophrenia while mice with 100% of NMDAR&#x27;s behaved normally. Schizophrenic behavior in low NMDAR mice has been effectively treated with antipsychotics that lower dopamine. NMDAR&#x27;s and dopamine receptors in the prefrontal cortex are associated with the cognitive impairments and working memory deficits commonly seen in schizophrenia. Rats that have been given a NMDAR antagonist exhibit a significant decrease in performance on cognitive tasks. Rats given a dopamine antagonist (antipsychotic) experience a reversal of the negative effects of the NMDAR antagonist. Glutamate imbalances appear to cause abnormal functioning in dopamine. When levels of glutamate are low dopamine is overactive and results in the expression schizophrenic symptoms.

=== Combined networks of dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate ===
Psychopharmacologist Stephen M. Stahl suggested in a review of 2018 that in many cases of psychosis, including schizophrenia, three interconnected networks based on dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate - each on its own or in various combinations - contributed to an overexcitation of dopamine D2 receptors in the ventral striatum.

<text>The Prajñaptivāda (Sanskrit; ) was a branch of the Mahāsāṃghika, one of the early Buddhist schools in India. The Prajñaptivādins were also known as the &quot;Bahuśrutīya-Vibhajyavādins&quot;.

== History ==
According to Vasumitra, the Prajñaptivāda school is said to have developed as one of several Mahāsāṃghika subschools. They are recorded as having taken up residence in the Himalayas. According to Tāranātha, the Prajñaptivādins continued to flourish in Magadha through the Pala Empire as late as the 10th century CE. A. K. Warder writes that the Prajñaptivādins were not known to have left Buddhism&#x27;s original territory (modern Northeast India, Bengal and Nepal).

== Doctrines and teachings ==
The &quot;Samayabhedhoparacanacakra&quot; records that the doctrines of the Prajñaptivāda school were similar to those of the main Mahāsāṃghika school.

=== Prajñapti ===
According to André Bareau, the name &quot;Prajñaptivāda&quot; refers to their doctrine that phenomena are the product of conceptualization (Skt. &quot;prajñapti&quot;). The Prajñaptivādins distinguished between conventional truth (Skt. &quot;saṃvṛti&quot;) and ultimate truth (Skt. &quot;paramārtha&quot;), and between reality (Skt. &quot;tattva&quot;) and mere concepts (Skt. &quot;prajñapti&quot;).

Vasumitra writes that the Prajñaptivādins viewed all conditioned phenomena as being mere concepts or notions (Skt. &quot;prajñapti&quot;), and therefore they were considered to be suffering. Contrary to the Sarvāstivādins, the Prajñaptivādins did not view the skandhas or the five elements as suffering. Instead these were viewed as existing merely as nominal entities without any ultimate existence.

=== Merit and karma ===
The Prajñaptivādins believed that the Noble Path is eternal and immutable, and that it is not possible for it to be lost or destroyed. They also held that the path was not something that could be cultivated through contemplation. However, they believed that the Path could be attained through all-knowledge (Skt. &quot;sarvajñāna&quot;) and the accumulation of merit. Whether one meets an untimely death or attains the Noble Path, the Prajñaptivādins viewed all such outcomes as being the result of merit and karma.

=== Spoken teachings ===
The Prajñaptivādins held that the Buddha&#x27;s teachings in the various &quot;piṭakas&quot; were nominal (Skt. &quot;prajñapti&quot;), conventional (Skt. &quot;&quot;), and causal (Skt. &quot;hetuphala&quot;). Therefore, all teachings were viewed by the Prajñaptivādins as being of provisional importance, since they cannot contain the ultimate truth. It has been observed that this view of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings is very close to the fully developed position of the Mahāyāna sūtras.

== Relationship to Mahāyāna ==

=== Theories ===
André Bareau considers the origin of the Mahāyāna tradition to be in the early Mahāsāṃghika schools, and cites the Bahuśrutīyas and Prajñaptivādins as sub-sects of the Mahāsāṃghika that may have played an important role in bridging the flow of Mahayana teachings between the northern and southern Mahāsāṃghika traditions.

=== Two truths doctrine ===
The Prajñaptivādins were early articulators of the two truths doctrine that is so important to the Mahāyāna, where it is usually found in the relationship between skillful means (Skt. &quot;upāya&quot;) and wisdom (Skt. &quot;prajñā&quot;). Ian Charles Harris has noted that the doctrines of the Prajñaptivāda school are indeed similar to the early Mahāyāna view of the two truths.

There is also evidence that the Prajñaptivādins were an influence on Nāgārjuna, who is also among the storied promulgators of the two truths doctrine (using some of the same technical terms), and who in his &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; only cites one text by name, that being the &quot;Kātyāyana Gotra Sūtra&quot;, of which the Prajñaptivādins were known to be fond.

<text>Caitika () was an early Buddhist school, a sub-sect of the Mahāsāṃghika. They were also known as the Caityaka sect.

The Caitikas proliferated throughout the mountains of South India, from which they derived their name. In Pali writings, members of this sect and its offshoots were generally referred to as the &quot;Andhakas&quot;, meaning &quot;of Coastal Andhra&quot;.

== History ==
The Caitikas branched off from the main Mahāsāṃghika school in the 1st or 2nd century BCE. Epigraphic evidence of the Mahāsāṃghikas in the Mathura region dates to the first century BCE, and the &quot;&quot; dates the formation of the Caitikas to 300 years after the Buddha. However, the ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Kṛṣṇa Valley, including Amarāvati Stupa, Nāgārjunakoṇḍā and Jaggayyapeṭa &quot;can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier.&quot;

The Caitikas gave rise to the Aparaśailas and Uttaraśailas (also called Pūrvaśailas). Together, they comprised an important part of the Mahāsāṃghika located in South India. Two other sub-sects associated with the Caitikas include the Rājagirikas and the Siddhārthikas, both of which emerged from the Andhra region around 300 CE.

The Caitikas are said to have had in their possession the Great Stupa at Sanchi. The Great Stūpa was first commissioned by Asoka in the 3rd century BCE and became known as a Buddhist pilgrimage site. In the Ajaṇṭā Caves, the only epigraphic reference to an early Buddhist sect is to that of the Caitikas, which is associated with an iconic image in Cave 10. The Mahāsāṃghikas were generally associated with the early veneration of anthropomorphic Buddha images.

When Xuanzang visited Dhānyakaṭaka, he wrote that the monks of this region were Mahāsāṃghikas, and mentions the Pūrvaśailas specifically. Near Dhānyakaṭaka, he met two Mahāsāṃghika bhikṣus and studied Mahāsāṃghika abhidharma with them for several months, during which time they also studied various Mahāyāna śāstras together under Xuanzang&#x27;s direction.

== Doctrine ==

The southern Mahāsāṃghika schools such as the Caitikas advocated the ideal of the bodhisattva, the bodhisattvayāna, over that of the arhat or śrāvakayāna, and they viewed arhats as being fallible and still subject to ignorance. The main Caitika school, along with the Aparaśailas and Uttaraśailas, all emphasized the transcendental and supernatural character of the Buddha.

Xuanzang considered the Mahāsāṃghika doctrine of a &quot;mūlavijñāna&quot; (&quot;root consciousness&quot;) to be essentially the same as the Yogacara doctrine of the ālāyavijñāna &quot;storehouse consciousness&quot;. He also noted that the doctrine of the &quot;mūlavijñāna&quot; was contained in the āgamas of the Mahāsāṃghikas.

==Relationship to Mahāyāna==

===Associations===
A. K. Warder holds that the Mahāyāna &quot;almost certainly&quot; first developed from the southern Mahāsāṃghika schools of the Āndhra region, among monastic communities associated with the Caitikas and their sub-sects.

Anthony Barber and Sree Padma note that &quot;historians of Buddhist thought have been aware for quite some time that such pivotally important Mahayana Buddhist thinkers as Nāgārjuna, Dignāga, Candrakīrti, Āryadeva, and Bhāviveka, among many others, formulated their theories while living in Buddhist communities in Āndhra.&quot;

===Royal patronage===
Some early Mahāyāna sūtras reference wealthy female donors and provide evidence that they were developed in the Āndhra region, where the Caitika were predominant. The Mahāyāna &quot;Mahāmegha Sūtra&quot;, for example, gives a prophecy about a royal princess of the Śatavāhana dynasty who will live in Āndhra, along the Kṛṣṇa River, in Dhānyakaṭaka, seven hundred years after the &quot;parinirvāṇa&quot; of the Buddha.

Several scholars such as Étienne Lamotte, and Alex and Hideko Wayman, associate the Āndra Ikṣvāku dynasty with patronage of Mahāyāna sūtras. Epigraphic evidence at Nāgārjunikoṇḍa also provides abundant evidence of royal and wealthy female donors.

===Prajñāpāramitā===
A number of scholars have proposed that the Mahāyāna Prajñāpāramitā teachings were first developed by the Caitika subsect of the Mahāsāṃghikas. They believe that the &quot;&quot; originated amongst the southern Mahāsāṃghika schools of the Āndhra region, along the Kṛṣṇa River. Guang Xing states, &quot;Several scholars have suggested that the Prajñāpāramitā probably developed among the Mahāsāṃghikas in southern India, in the Āndhra country, on the Kṛṣṇa River.&quot; These Mahāsāṃghikas had two famous monasteries near the Amarāvati and the Dhānyakaṭaka, which gave their names to the schools of the Pūrvaśailas and the Aparaśailas. Each of these schools had a copy of the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; in Prakrit. Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; as being that of the Mahāsāṃghikas. Edward Conze estimates that this sūtra originated around 100 BCE.

===Tathāgatagarbha===
Brian Edward Brown, a specialist in Tathāgatagarbha doctrines, writes that it has been determined that the composition of the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot; occurred during the Āndra Ikṣvāku dynasty in the 3rd century CE as a product of the Mahāsāṃghikas of the Āndhra region (i.e. the Caitika schools). Alex Wayman has outlined eleven points of complete agreement between the Mahāsāṃghikas and the &quot;Śrīmālā&quot;, along with four major arguments for this association. After its composition, this text became the primary scriptural advocate in India for the universal potentiality of Buddhahood. Anthony Barber also associates the earlier development of the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra&quot; with the Mahāsāṃghikas, and concludes that the Mahāsāṃghikas of the Āndhra region were responsible for the inception of the Tathāgatagarbha doctrine.

===Bodhisattva canons===
In the 6th century CE, Bhāviveka speaks of the Siddhārthikas using a Vidyādhāra Piṭaka, and the Aparaśailas and Uttaraśailas (Pūrvaśailas) both using a Bodhisattva Piṭaka, implying collections of Mahāyāna texts within these Caitika schools. During the same period, Avalokitavrata speaks of the Mahāsāṃghikas using a &quot;Great Āgama Piṭaka&quot;, which is then associated with Mahāyāna sūtras such as the &quot;Prajñāparamitā&quot; and the &quot;Ten Stages Sutra&quot;. Avalokitavrata also states that Mahāyāna sūtras such as the &quot;Prajñāparamitā&quot; were recited by the Aparaśailas and the Pūrvaśailas.

According to the Theravādin text &quot;Nikāyasaṅgraha&quot;, the large Mahāyāna collection called the &quot;Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra&quot; (Taishō Tripiṭaka, 310) was composed by the &quot;Andhakas&quot;, meaning the Caitika schools of the Āndhra region. This collection includes the &quot;Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Akṣobhyavyūha Sūtra&quot;, a long text called the &quot;Bodhisattva Piṭaka&quot;, and others. The &quot;Mahāratnakūṭa&quot; collection totals 49 Mahāyāna sūtras, divided into 120 fascicles in the Chinese translation.

== Disputes with Theravāda ==
In the Mahāvihara tradition of the Theravāda school, Buddhaghoṣa grouped the Caitika schools in the Āndhra region, such as the Rājagirikas and the Siddhārthikas, as the &quot;Andhakas&quot;. Works such as the &quot;Kathāvatthu&quot; show that Mahāvihara polemics were directed overwhelmingly at these &quot;Andhakas&quot; in India.

===Textual authenticity===
The Caitika schools rejected the post-Asokan texts that were in use by the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya tradition such as the &quot;Parivara&quot;, the six books of Abhidharma, the &quot;Patisambhidamagga&quot;, the &quot;Niddesa&quot;, some Jataka tales, some verses, and so on. For example, the Caitikas claimed that their own Jataka tales represented the original collection before the Buddhist tradition split into various lineages.

===Interpretation of Buddhist texts===
One dispute recorded in the &quot;Kathāvatthu&quot; between the Mahāviharavasins and the Andhakas was a fundamental matter concerning the interpretation of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings. The Andhakas are said to have held that the Buddha&#x27;s actions and speech were supramundane, but some may only perceive the conventional or mundane interpretation. For the Mahāsāṃghika branch of Buddhism, the ultimate meaning of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings was &quot;beyond words&quot;, and words were merely a conventional exposition of the Dharma. The Theravāda Mahāviharavasins, in contrast, argued that literal interpretations of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings were best.

<text>The Kitchen Debate () was a series of impromptu exchanges through interpreters between U.S. vice president Richard Nixon and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, at the opening of the American National Exhibition at Sokolniki Park in Moscow on July 24, 1959.

An entire house was built for the exhibition which the American exhibitors claimed that anyone in the United States could afford. It was filled with labor-saving and recreational devices meant to represent the fruits of the capitalist American consumer market. The debate was recorded on color videotape, and Nixon made reference to this fact; it was subsequently broadcast in both countries.

==History==
In 1959, the Soviet Union and United States agreed to hold exhibits in each other&#x27;s countries as a cultural exchange to promote understanding. This was a result of the 1958 U.S.–Soviet Cultural Agreement. The Soviet exhibit in New York City opened in June 1959, and Vice President Nixon was on hand the following month to open the U.S. exhibit in Moscow. Nixon took Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev on a tour of the exhibit. There were multiple displays and consumer goods provided by more than 450 American companies. The centerpiece of the exhibit was a geodesic dome that housed scientific and technical experiments in a facility. The Soviets purchased the dome at the end of the Moscow exhibition.

William Safire was the exhibitor&#x27;s press agent, and he recounted that the Kitchen Debate took place in a number of locations at the exhibition, but primarily in the kitchen of a suburban model house that was cut in half for easy viewing. This was only one of a series of four meetings that occurred between Nixon and Khrushchev during the 1959 exhibition. Nixon was accompanied by President Eisenhower&#x27;s younger brother Milton S. Eisenhower, then president of Johns Hopkins University.

Khrushchev surprised Nixon during the first meeting in the Kremlin when he protested the Captive Nations Resolution passed by the US Congress, which condemned the Soviet Union for its &quot;control&quot; over the &quot;captive&quot; peoples of Eastern Europe and called upon Americans to pray for those people. After protesting the actions of the U.S. Congress, he dismissed the new technology of the U.S. and declared that the Soviets would have all of the same things in a few years and then say &quot;Bye bye&quot; as they surpassed the U.S.

Khrushchev criticised the large range of American gadgets. In particular, Khrushchev saw that some of the gadgets were harder to use than the traditional way. One of these devices was a handheld lemon juicer for tea. He criticized the device, saying that it was much easier to squeeze the juice out by hand and the appliance was unnecessary. Khrushchev asked Nixon if this device was standard in American kitchens. Nixon admitted some of the products had not hit the U.S. market, and were prototypes. Khrushchev satirically asked &quot;Don&#x27;t you have a machine that puts food into the mouth and pushes it down?&quot;, a reference to Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s 1936 film &quot;Modern Times&quot;. Nixon responded that at least the competition was technological rather than military. Both men agreed that the United States and the Soviet Union should seek areas of agreement.

The second visit occurred in a television studio inside the American exhibit. In the end, Khrushchev stated that everything that he had said in their debate should be translated into English and broadcast in the U.S. Nixon responded, &quot;Certainly it will, and everything I say is to be translated into Russian and broadcast across the Soviet Union. That&#x27;s a fair bargain.&quot; Khrushchev vigorously shook hands to this proposal.

Nixon argued that the Americans built to take advantage of new techniques, while Khrushchev advocated for Communism by arguing that the Soviets built for future generations. Khrushchev stated, &quot;This is what America is capable of, and how long has she existed? 300 years? 150 years of independence and this is her level. We haven&#x27;t quite reached 42 years, and in another 7 years, we&#x27;ll be at the level of America, and after that we&#x27;ll go farther.&quot; Safire reported that Leonid Brezhnev was present and attempted to obstruct his photos.

The third visit occurred inside the kitchen on a cutaway model home that was furnished with a dishwasher, refrigerator, and range. It was designed to represent a $14,000 home that a typical American worker could afford ().

== The role of women and the Kitchen Debate ==
During the third visit, in which Nixon and Khrushchev toured a model American kitchen, the two men began an unplanned debate. Nixon&#x27;s opening argument to the Kitchen Debate rested on United States&#x27; appreciation for housewives; he stressed that offering women the opportunity to reside in a comfortable home, through having the appliances be directly-installed, was an example of American superiority. 

Whilst pointing to the dishwasher, Nixon emphasized on his strive to make life easier for women by way of the pre-installed units. Khrushchev replied, &quot;Your capitalistic attitude toward women does not occur under Communism,&quot; to which Nixon fired back, &quot;I think that this attitude towards women is universal. What we want to do, is make life more easy for our housewives.&quot;

==Television broadcast and American reaction==
The three major American television networks broadcast the Kitchen Debate on July 25, 1959. The Soviets subsequently protested, as Nixon and Khrushchev had agreed that the debate should be broadcast simultaneously in America and the Soviet Union, with the Soviets threatening to withhold the tape until they were ready to broadcast. The American networks, however, had felt that the delay would cause the news to lose its immediacy. The debate was broadcast on Moscow television on July 27, albeit late at night and with Nixon&#x27;s remarks only partially translated.

American reaction was mixed. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an exchange that emphasized the gulf between east and west but had little bearing on the substantive issue&quot; and portrayed it as a political stunt. The paper also declared that public opinion seemed divided after the debates. &quot;Time&quot; magazine, on the other hand, praised Nixon, saying that he &quot;managed in a unique way to personify a national character proud of peaceful accomplishment, sure of its way of life, confident of its power under threat.&quot;

Nixon gained popularity because of the informal nature of the exchange, improving upon the lukewarm reception that he previously had with the American public. According to William Safire, he also impressed Khrushchev: &quot;The shrewd Khrushchev came away from his personal duel of words with Nixon persuaded that the advocate of capitalism was not just tough-minded but strong-willed.&quot;

The trip raised Nixon&#x27;s profile as a public statesman, greatly improving his chances of receiving the Republican presidential nomination the following year. Khrushchev in a 1961 meeting with Nixon&#x27;s opponent in the ensuing election, John F. Kennedy, would joke that he had voted for Kennedy.

In the Kitchen Debate, Khrushchev claimed that Nixon&#x27;s grandchildren would live under communism and Nixon claimed that Khrushchev&#x27;s grandchildren would live in freedom. In a 1992 interview, Nixon commented that at the time of the debate, he was sure Khrushchev&#x27;s claim was wrong, but Nixon was not sure that his own assertion was correct. Nixon said that events had proven that he was indeed right because Khrushchev&#x27;s grandchildren (Khrushchev&#x27;s son Sergei Khrushchev was a naturalized American citizen) now lived in freedom, referring to then recent collapse of the Soviet Union.

<text>Greater St. Louis is 
the 23rd-largest metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the United States, the largest in Missouri, and the second-largest in Illinois. Its core city—St. Louis, Missouri—sits in the geographic center of the metro area, on the west bank of the Mississippi River. The river bisects the metro area geographically between Illinois and Missouri, although the latter portion is much more populous. The MSA includes St. Louis County, which is independent of the City of St. Louis; their two populations are generally tabulated separately.

The St. Louis, MO-IL metropolitan statistical area (MSA) includes the City of St. Louis; the Illinois counties of Bond, Calhoun, Clinton, Jersey, Macoupin, Madison, Monroe, and St. Clair (known collectively as the Metro East); and the Missouri counties of Crawford (only the City of Sullivan), Franklin, Jefferson, Lincoln, St. Charles, St. Louis (separate from and not inclusive of the city of St. Louis), and Warren.

The larger St. Louis–St. Charles–Farmington, MO–IL combined statistical area (CSA) includes all of the aforementioned MSA, plus the Farmington, MO micropolitan statistical area, which includes St. Francois County, Missouri, and the Centralia, IL micropolitan statistical area, which includes Marion County, Illinois.

In 2020, the St. Louis MSA was the 21st-largest in the nation with a population of 2,820,253. The larger CSA is ranked 20th largest in the United States, with a population of 2,909,003. It fell out of the country&#x27;s top 20 largest MSAs in 2017 for the first time since 1840.

As of 2021, Greater St. Louis is home to the headquarters of ten of Missouri&#x27;s eleven Fortune 500 companies, six Fortune 1,000 companies, and two of the top 30 largest private companies in America, as ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot;. The metropolitan area received the All-America City Award in 2008.

==History==

The Illini Confederacy once dominated what is today the St. Louis area. During the 17th century, the population of indigenous peoples in the area was well over tens of thousands, including 20,000 in the Grand Village of Illinois. Indigenous peoples in the area built earthwork mounds on both sides of the Mississippi River, with the Cahokia Mounds as the regional center. St. Louis would later receive the nickname of &quot;Mound City&quot;.

Pierre Laclede Liguest and his 13-year-old grandson, Auguste Chouteau, selected St. Louis as the site for a French fur trading post in 1764 because it was a rarely flooded area at the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. In 1770, ownership of St. Louis was transferred to Spain, and then returned to France during a secret treaty (Treaty of San Ildefonso). 

The area became part of the United States in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, and steadily grew thereafter. It was the starting point for Lewis and Clark. St. Louis was incorporated as a city in 1823. Between 1840 and 1860, the population exploded, particularly because of the arrival of German and Irish immigrants. St. Louis&#x27;s current boundaries were established in 1876. After the American Civil War, St. Louis continued to grow into a major manufacturing center due to its access to rail and water transportation. By the 1890s, St. Louis was the 4th-largest city in the United States.

In 1904, St. Louis hosted the world&#x27;s fair in Forest Park and the Olympics at Washington University&#x27;s Francis Field. More than 20 million people visited the city during the fair&#x27;s seven-month long run. St. Louis was seen as a city of industrialization with ties to the automobile industry. The Great Migration between World War I and World War II brought thousands of African Americans to the city, boosting St. Louis&#x27;s population to 800,000 by 1940. The population peaked in 1950 at 856,000. There was no more room for expansion within city boundaries and earlier immigrant generations started moving to suburbs that could not be annexed.

During the mid-1960s, construction began on the Gateway Arch and Busch Stadium, in part to help revitalize the central business district. A 30-year downtown building boom followed. Today, there is a continued population decline although revitalization efforts are under way.

<doc id="599641" wikidata="Q255774" url="?curid=599641" title="Sautrāntika">
<text>The Sautrāntika or Sutravadin (, Suttavāda in Pali; ; ; ) were an early Buddhist school generally believed to be descended from the Sthavira nikāya by way of their immediate parent school, the Sarvāstivādins. While they are identified as a unique doctrinal tendency, they were part of the Sarvāstivāda Vinaya lineage of monastic ordination.

Their name means literally &quot;the conclusions of the sutras&quot; where &quot;sūtra&quot; is lengthened into the &quot;vṛddhi&quot; derivative &quot;sautra,&quot; and combined with the word &quot;anta,&quot; meaning end or conclusion, with a final nominal marker &quot;ika&quot; (compare with the term vedānta), meaning their philosophy is derived from the &quot;sūtras.&quot; As stated by the commentator Yasomitra, they hold the sutras, but not the Abhidharma commentaries (sastras), as authoritative. The views of this group first appear in the &quot;Abhidharmakośabhāṣya&quot; of Vasubandhu&quot;.&quot;

==Name==
The name Sautrāntika indicates that unlike other North Indian Sthaviras, this school held the Buddhist sutras as central to their views, over and above the ideas presented in the Abhidharma literature. The Sarvastivada scholar Samghabhadra, in his &quot;Nyayanusara&quot;, attacks a school of thought named Sautrantika which he associates with the scholars Śrīlāta and his student Vasubandhu. According to Samghabhadra, a central tenet of this school was that all sutra is explicit meaning (&quot;nitartha&quot;), hence their name.

The Sarvāstivādins sometimes referred to them as the school, meaning &quot;those who utilize the method of examples&quot;. This latter name may have been a pejorative label. It is also possible that the name &#x27;Dārṣṭāntika&#x27; identifies a predecessor tradition, or another related, but distinct, doctrinal position; the exact relationship between the two terms is unclear. Charles Willemen identifies the Sautrāntika as a Western branch of the Sarvāstivādins, active in the Gandhara area, who split from the Sarvāstivādins sometime before 200 CE, when the Sautrāntika name emerged. Other scholars are less confident of a specific identification for the Sautrāntika; Nobuyoshi Yamabe calls specifying the precise identity of the Sautrāntika &quot;one of the biggest problems in current Buddhist scholarship&quot;.

==History==
The founding of the Sautrāntika school is attributed to the elder Kumāralāta (c. 3rd century CE), author of a &quot;collection of dṛṣtānta&quot; (&quot;Dṛṣtāntapaṅkti&quot;) called the &quot;Kalpanāmaṇḍitīkā&quot;. The Sautrāntikas were sometimes also called &quot;disciples of Kumāralāta&quot;. According to Chinese sources, Harivarman (250-350 CE) was a student of Kumāralāta who became disillusioned with Buddhist Abhidharma and then wrote the Tattvasiddhi-śāstra in order to &quot;eliminate confusion and abandon the later developments, with the hope of returning to the origin&quot;. The Tattvasiddhi was translated into Chinese and became an important text in Chinese Buddhism until the Tang Dynasty.

Other works by Sautrāntika affiliated authors include the &quot;Abhidharmāmṛtarasa-śāstra&quot; attributed to Ghoṣaka, and the &quot;Abhidharmāvatāra-śāstra&quot; attributed to Skandhila. The elder Śrīlāta, who was Vasubandhu&#x27;s teacher is also known as a famous Sautrāntika who wrote the &quot;Sautrāntika-vibhāṣa&quot;. Ghoṣaka&#x27;s Abhidharmāmṛtarasa and Harivarman&#x27;s Tattvasiddhi have both been translated into English.

The Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu wrote the famous Abhidharma work &quot;Abhidharmakośakārikā&quot; which presented Sarvāstivāda-Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma tenets, he also wrote a &quot;bhāṣya&quot; or commentary on this work, which presented critiques of the Vaibhāṣika tradition from a Sautrāntika perspective. The Abhidharmakośa was highly influential and is the main text on Abhidharma used in Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism up until today.

Buddhist logic (&quot;pramāṇavāda&quot;) as developed by Dignāga and Dharmakīrti is also associated with the Sautrāntika school.

==Doctrine==

No separate vinaya (monastic code) specific to the Sautrāntika has been found, nor is the existence of any such separate disciplinary code evidenced in other texts; this indicates that they were likely only a doctrinal division within the Sarvāstivādin school.

The Sautrāntika criticized the Sarvāstivādins on various matters such as ontology, philosophy of mind and perception. While the Sarvāstivādin abhidharma described a complex system in which past, present, and future phenomena are all held to have some form of their own existence, the Sautrāntika subscribed to a doctrine of &quot;extreme momentariness&quot; that held that only the present moment existed. They seem to have regarded the Sarvāstivādin position as a violation of the basic Buddhist principle of impermanence. As explained by Jan Westerhoff, this doctrine of momentariness holds that each present moment &quot;does not possess any temporal thickness; immediately after coming into existence each moment passes out of existence&quot; and that therefore &quot;all dharmas, whether mental or material, only last for an instant (ksana) and cease immediately after arising&quot;.

The Sarvāstivādin abhidharma also broke down human experience in terms of a variety of underlying phenomena (a view similar to that held by the modern Theravadin abhidhamma); the Sautrāntika believed that experience could not be differentiated in this manner.

Sautrantika doctrines expounded by elder Śrīlāta and critiqued in turn by Samghabhadra&#x27;s &quot;Nyayanusara&quot; include:

*The theory of &quot;anudhatu&quot; (or *&quot;purvanudhatu&quot;, &quot;subsidiary element&quot;), which is also associated with the theory of seeds (&quot;Bīja&quot;) espoused by Vasubandhu. This theory was used to explain karma and rebirth.
*The doctrine that caitasikas (mental factors) are but modes of citta (mind) and are &quot;not&quot; separate elemental dharmas which come together in &quot;association&quot; (&quot;samprayoga&quot;) as the Vaibhāṣika believed. This view is also expoused at length in Harivarman&#x27;s Tattvasiddhi.
*The doctrine that the sense-elements (&quot;dhatu&quot;) alone are real existents, not the aggregates (&quot;skandha&quot;) or sense spheres (&quot;ayatana&quot;).
*A process of direct perception (&quot;pratyaksha&quot;) which differed from the direct realism of the Vaibhāṣika, and instead posited a form of indirect representationalism.

According to Vasubandhu, the Sautrāntika also held the view that there may be many Buddhas simultaneously, otherwise known as the doctrine of contemporaneous Buddhas.

<text>This is a list of members of Parliament elected at the February 1974 general election, held on 28 February. This was the first of two general elections to be held that year. Parliament convened on 12 March 1974 at the Palace of Westminster by Queen Elizabeth II. It was dissolved just over six months later on 20 September 1974, making it the shortest UK parliament in history and the shortest parliament to sit at Westminster since 1681.

==Composition==
These representative diagrams show the composition of the parties in the February 1974 general election.

Note: The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru sit together as a party group. This is not the official seating plan of the House of Commons, which has five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the speaker and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.

<doc id="599647" wikidata="Q1973327" url="?curid=599647" title="ROM image">
<text>A ROM image, or ROM file, is a computer file which contains a copy of the data from a read-only memory chip, often from a video game cartridge, or used to contain a computer&#x27;s firmware, or from an arcade game&#x27;s main board. The term is frequently used in the context of emulation, whereby older games or firmware are copied to ROM files on modern computers and can, using a piece of software known as an emulator, be run on a different device than which they were designed for. ROM burners are used to copy ROM images to hardware, such as ROM cartridges, or ROM chips, for debugging and QA testing.

== Creation ==
ROMs can be copied from the read-only memory chips found in cartridge-based games and many arcade machines using a dedicated device in a process known as &quot;dumping&quot;. For most common home video game systems, these devices are widely available, examples being the Doctor V64, or the Retrode.

Dumping ROMs from arcade machines, which are highly customized PCBs, often requires individual setups for each machine along with a large amount of expertise.

=== Copy protection mechanisms ===

While ROM images are often used as a means of preserving the history of computer games, they are also often used to facilitate the unauthorized copying and redistribution of modern games. Viewing this as potentially reducing sales of their products, many game companies have incorporated features into newer games which are designed to prevent copying, while still allowing the original game to be played. For instance, the GameCube uses non-standard 8 cm DVD-like optical media, which for a long time prevented games stored on those discs from being copied. It was not until a security hole was found in Phantasy Star Online Episode I &amp; II that GameCube games could be successfully copied, using the GameCube itself to read the discs.

SNK also employed a method of copy prevention on their Neo Geo games, starting with &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; in 1999, which used an encryption algorithm on the graphics ROMs to prevent them from being played in an emulator. Many thought that this would mark the end of Neo Geo emulation. However, as early as 2000, hackers found a way to decrypt and dump the ROMs successfully, making them playable once again in a Neo Geo emulator.

Another company which used to employ methods of copy prevention on their arcade games was Capcom, which is known for its CPS-2 arcade board. This contained a heavy copy protection algorithm which was not broken until 7 years after the system&#x27;s release in 1993. The original crack by the CPS2Shock Team was not a true emulation of the protection because it used XOR tables to bypass the original encryption and allow the game to play in an emulator. Their stated intent was to wait until CPS-2 games were no longer profitable to release the decryption method (three years after the last game release). The full decryption algorithm was cracked in 2007 by Nicola Salmoria, Andreas Naive and Charles MacDonald of the MAME development team.

Another copy prevention technique used in cartridge-games was to have the game attempt to write to ROM. On an authentic cartridge this would do nothing; however, emulators would often allow the write to succeed. Pirate cartridges also often used writable chips instead of ROM. By reading the value back to see whether the write succeeded, the game could tell whether it was running from an authentic cartridge. Alternatively, the game may simply attempt to overwrite critical program instructions, which if successful renders it unplayable.

Some games, such as Game Boy games, also had other hardware such as memory bank controllers connected to the cartridge bus. The game would send data to this hardware by attempting to write it to specific areas of ROM; thus, if the ROM were writable, this process would corrupt data.

Capcom&#x27;s latest arcade board is the CPS-3. This was resistant to emulation attempts until June 2007, when the encryption method was reverse-engineered by Andreas Naive. It is currently implemented by MAME and a variant of the CPS-2 emulator Nebula.

== Uses ==

=== Emulation ===
Video game console emulators typically take ROM images as input files.

=== Software ROM ===

ROM images are used when developing for embedded computers. Software which is being developed for embedded computers is often written to ROM files for testing on a standard computer before it is written to a ROM chip for use in the embedded systems.

=== Digital preservation ===

The lifespan of digital media is rarely great. While black-and-white photographs may survive for a century or more, many digital media can become unreadable after only 10 years. This is beginning to become a problem as early computer systems may be presently fifty or sixty years old while early home video consoles may be almost forty years old. Due to this aging, there is a significant worry that many early computer and video games may not survive without being transferred to new media. So, those with an interest in preservation are actively seeking older arcade and video games and attempting to dump them to ROM images. When stored on standardized media such as CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs, they can be copied to future media with significantly reduced effort.

The trend towards mass digital distribution of ROM image files, while potentially damaging to copyright holders, may also have a positive effect on preservation. While over time many original ROM copies of older games may deteriorate, be broken or thrown away, a copy in file form may be distributed throughout the world, allowing games which would otherwise have been lost a greater chance of survival.

=== Hacks and fan translations ===
Once games have been made available in ROM format, it is possible for users to make modifications. This may take the form of altering graphics, changing game levels, tweaking difficulty factor, or even translation into a language for which a game was not originally made available. Hacks can often take humorous forms, as is the case with a hack of the NES version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, titled &quot;Afro Mario Brothers&quot;, which features the famous brothers wearing Afro haircuts. The &quot;Metroid Redesign&quot; mod is a hack of &quot;Super Metroid&quot; that revamps the game and adds new objectives.

A large scene has developed to translate games into other languages. Many games receive a release in one part of the world, but not in another. For example, many role-playing video games released in Japan go unreleased in the West and East outside Japan. A group of fan translators will often translate the game themselves to meet demand for titles. For example, the 1995 game &quot;Tales of Phantasia&quot; was only officially released in Japan; DeJap Translations translated the game&#x27;s on-screen text into English in 2001. Further to this, a project called Vocals of Phantasia was begun to translate the actual speech from the game. An official English version was not released until March 2006, some five years after the text translation was released. Another example was that of Mother 3, a Japan-only sequel to the cult-favorite Earthbound. In spite of massive fan response and several petitions for an English translation, the only response from Nintendo was that Mother 3 would be translated and released in Europe, which it never was. Instead, the fan website Starmen.net undertook a massive translation project and released the translated version of Mother 3 in October, 2008. The translation was praised by fans and even employees from Nintendo, Square Enix, and other industry professionals.

The Japanese N64 game &quot;Dōbutsu no Mori&quot; (Animal Forest) has also been translated into English. The game was originally only released on N64 in Japan, but it was ported to GameCube and renamed Animal Crossing.

Hacks may range from simple tweaks such as graphic fixes and cheats, to full-blown redesigns of the game, in effect creating an entirely new game using the original as a base.

== Similar image types ==

Image files derived from computer tape are known as tape images, while those derived from floppy disks and CD-ROMs (and other disk formats) are known as disk images. Images copied from optical media are also called ISO images, after one of the standard file systems for optical media, ISO 9660.

Creating images from other media is often considerably easier and can often be performed with off-the-shelf hardware. For example, the creation of tape images from games stored on magnetic tapes (from, for example, the Sinclair ZX80 computer) generally involves simply playing the magnetic tape using a standard audio tape player connected to the line-in of a PC sound card. This is then recorded to an audio file and transformed into a tape image file using another program. Likewise, many CD and DVD games may be copied using a standard PC CD/DVD drive.

<text>The white-bellied woolly mouse opossum (Marmosa constantiae) is a small pouchless marsupial of the family Didelphidae. It was formerly assigned to the genus &quot;Micoureus&quot;, which was made a subgenus of &quot;Marmosa&quot; in 2009. The specific epithet was given in honour of Constance Sladen (née Anderson), wife of the naturalist Percy Sladen. She funded the 1902 expedition which collected the type specimen.

==Description==
This is one of the larger mouse opossums, with a head=body length of , a tail in length, and weighing from . The fur is thick and woolly, and is grey over most of the body, fading to buffy-yellow on the head and underparts. There are clear, but narrow, rings of black fur around the eyes. The tail is furred only at the base, and is near black for most of its length, but changes suddenly to pale pink along the last third or so.

The feet are broad, with stout claws and ridges on the underside of the toes that aid in climbing trees. Females do not have a pouch, but have fifteen teats arranged in a circle - more than in any of this species&#x27; closest relatives.

==Distribution and habitat==
The opossum is found across northern Bolivia, in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, and in northern Argentina as far south as Tucumán Province. It has also recently been reported from Paraguay. Across this region, it inhabits moist tropical forests, often near the boundary with drier habitats, and has been found from near sea level to montane forests as high as elevation.

==Biology and behaviour==
The opossum is arboreal, solitary, and nocturnal, spending most of its time in the forest understory. It is omnivorous, feeding on insects (especially bugs) and vegetable matter. Little is known of their reproductive biology, but they appear to breed throughout the year, and mothers have been captured with up to seven young attached to their teats.

<text>Karaikal (, , ) is a port city of the Indian Union Territory of Puducherry. It is the administrative headquarters of the Karaikal District and the second most populated town in the Union Territory after Pondicherry. Located on the Coromandel Coast of Bay of Bengal in South India, it is situated at the center of a coastal enclave surrounded by the state of Tamil Nadu and its Cauvery delta districts (Mayiladuthurai, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam).

==Etymology==

The origin of the word Karaikal is uncertain. The Imperial Gazetteer of British India gives its meaning as &#x27;fish pass&#x27;. Both the words &#x27;Karai&#x27; and &#x27;Kal&#x27; have several meanings, of which the more acceptable ones are &#x27;lime mix&#x27; and &#x27;canal&#x27; respectively. Hence it has been suggested that the name may mean a canal built of lime mix, however, no trace of such a canal is evident.

== History ==
In 1738, Karaikal was promised to the French by Sayaji, the exiled Rajah of Thanjavur, in exchange for their assistance. However, the transfer of control only occurred in 1739 with the help of Chanda Sahib of Arcot, when the French formally obtained the town.

In 1749, additional territories consisting of 81 villages were ceded by Pratap Singh to the French during their siege of Thanjavur, a grant that was confirmed by treaty in 1754. Karaikal changed hands multiple times in the following years due to conflicts between the French and the British, notably during the siege of 1760, when British forces captured the town after a ten-day defense.

Karaikal was eventually restored to French control in 1817 following the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The French continued to hold control, despite occasional interruptions by the British Raj, until 1954, when it was de facto incorporated into the Republic of India. Karaikal, along with the other French Indian colonies of Mahé, Yanaon, Chandernagor, and Pondichéry, was de jure integrated into India in 1962.

==Geography==
Karaikal is a small coastal enclave which was formerly part of French India. Together with the other former French territories of Pondicherry, Yanam, and Mahé, it forms the Union Territory of Puducherry. Karaikal is bounded on three sides by three districts of Tamil Nadu, on the North by Mayiladuthurai district, on the South by Nagapattinam district of Tamil Nadu state, on the west by Tiruvarur district (also belonging to Tamil Nadu), and on the East by the Bay of Bengal. The enclave is located south of the city of Pondicherry, east of Trichy and is known for its rich cultural heritage. 

The main branches of Kaveri below Grand Anicut are the Kudamurutti, Arasalar, Virasolanar and the Vikramanar. Although Arasalar and its branches spread through Karaikal, the waters of Kudamurutti and Virasolanar also meet the irrigation needs of the region.

Forming a part of the fertile Kaveri delta, the region is completely covered by the distributaries of Cauvery. Covered completely by a thick mantle of alluvium of variable thickness, the lie of the region is flat having a gentle slope towards the Bay of Bengal in the east. It is limited on the north by the Nandalar and on the south-east by the Vettar. The group of rocks known as Cuddalore formations is met with in the area contiguous to Karaikal region in Nagapattinam district.

=== Climate ===
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as tropical wet and dry (&quot;As&quot;).

==Governance==

The District Collector is the official representative to the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Co-ordinator and Liaison Officer to all Government departments of Karaikal district. District Collectorate, Karaikal is the functional headquarters of Karaikal District.

Karaikal region is made up of Karaikal municipality and the Communes of
* Nedungadu
* Kottucherry
* Neravy
* Thirunallar
* Tirumalarajanpattinam
* Poovam
* Varichikudy

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 Census of India, total population of Karaikal district is 2,00,222, comprising 97,809 males and 1,02,413 females. Population of the district accounts for 16.04% of the total population of Puducherry U.T. and ranks second among the districts. The literacy rate is 87.1%, with male literacy at 92.4% and female literacy at 82.0%.

==Culture==

Karaikal is renowned for its connection with Karaikal Ammaiyar, a leading Shaivite saint and Bhakti poetess, amongst the sixty-three nayanmar, who lived there around the 5th century CE. A sanctuary, the Karaikal Ammaiyar temple, is dedicated to her, and popular for its annual celebration of &quot;Mangani&quot; (the Mango Festival or &quot;Fête des Mangues&quot; in French), which takes place in summer. The event is the town&#x27;s main feast. Located on the former (now Bharathiyar Street), the temple is neighboured by the Shaivite temple of Kailasanathar and the Vaishnavite temple of Nithyakalyana Perumal. The three religious sites share the Chandra Theertham tank, which lies along the street. A second religious celebration in the town concerns exclusively the Kailasanathar temple, which organizes the Karaikal Chariot festival. 

Karaikal is also commonly associated with the temple devoted to the Lord Saneesvara at Thirunallar, one of the &quot;Navagraha Sthalam&quot; in the Kumbakonam region. The Dharbaranyesvarar temple of Thirunallar is as well one of the &quot;Sapta Vidanga Sthalam&quot;, an important network of Shaivite shrines in relation with the famed Thyagaraja temple of Thiruvarur. Three other significant Shaivite sanctuaries, among the &quot;Paadal Petra Sthalam&quot;, are also located nearby Karaikal. These are the Dharmapuram Yazhmoorinathar temple in Dharmapuram, between the communes of Karaikal and Thirunallar, the Tiruttelicheri Parvatheesvarar temple, in nowadays Kovil Pathu, on the outskirts of the town, and the Thiruvettakudi Sundaresvarar temple in Thiruvettakudi, a hamlet east to the village of Varichikudi. 

Of lesser reverence with respect to the &quot;Paadal Petra Sthalam&quot;, Karaikal and its surroundings also feature temples esteemed in the Saiva Siddhanta tradition, designated as the &quot;Vaippu Sthalam&quot;. Mentioned in the religious literature associated with this tradition, there are two of these temples, the Raja Chozheesvarar temple at Thirumalairayanpattinam or T.R Patnam (once known as the in French), and the Thirulokanathar temple at Thakkalur, a hamlet between Dharmapuram and Thirunallar. The Muslim presence in Karaikal grew between the 18th and 19th centuries. The town witnessed the establishment of a Bukharan Muslim Sufi cleric christened Mastan Saheb in the early 19th century. He attracted many Muslims to the town, and his fruitful preaching brought new believers. Following his demise in 1829, a dargah formed, and a commemorative procession (an urs), known locally as &quot;Kanduri&quot; (the Kanduri Festival or &quot;Candry&quot; in French), is held annually. Karaikal&#x27;s Dargah is an architecturally remarkable building, reminiscent of the more famous Dargah at nearby Nagore, and demonstrative of the Islamic architectural style in use at the time in the Tanjore region, and more widely in the Deccan. The adjacent Grand Mosque is also a remarkable architectural structure, with a more pronounced Indo-Saracenic influence. 

==Economy==

Most of the people in town are office goers and industrial workers. There are a number of iron and steel rolling mills, spinning mills, tiles, polythene, rubber and chemical industries in Karaikal. Other common sources of the people&#x27;s income come from business. The prominent source of income of this district is agriculture and fishing. Karaikal is a coastal town with a total coastline of . There are 12 big fishing hamlets and around more than 25,000 fishermen (6,000 families) are living in these coastal villages. Their main employment is fishing, exporting and fishing related activities. The other main source is the liquor business, the tax being less and the cost almost half when compared to the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. Karaikal is one of the towns in South India with high cost of living due to French NRI&#x27;s presence. Thousands of families with their origin in Karaikal live in France. Puducherry Power Corporation Limited is Generating Electricity with Natural gas fuel in their combined cycle power plant and supply the electricity to Puducherry Electricity Department. The fuel gas received through GAIL India Limited by underground pipelines from ONGC Wells.The ONGC&#x27;s office Kaveri rig is at Karaikal.

Karaikal Airport is a greenfield project nearby Karaikal, currently frozen. It would have been the first airport in the country built entirely with private capital. The project received in-principle clearance from the Ministry of Civil Aviation in February 2011. Karaikal Airport&#x27;s Air Traffic Control, however, would have been operated by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). In its initial plans, the airport, spread across , was being developed by Karaikal Airport Private Limited, a subsidiary of Super Airport Private Limited. The first phase of construction would have included construction of a 1200-metre runway and a terminal building capable of handling 120 passengers during peak hours. The airport was expected to handle regional turboprop airliners like the ATR-42. The company planned to expand the airport after five years, extending the runway to and increasing terminal building capacity to 500 passengers per hour. A further expansion was planned ten years down the line with a 3500-metre runway and a passenger capacity of 1,000 per hour.

<text>Litton Industries, Inc., was an American defense contractor that specialized in shipbuilding, aerospace, electronic components, and information technology. The company was founded in 1953 and was named after inventor Charles Litton Sr., who was also an early investor in the company. 

During the 1960s, the company began acquiring many unrelated firms and became one of the largest conglomerates in the United States. At its peak, in addition to many defense-related companies, it also owned both Royal Typewriters and Adler, Moffat major appliances, Stouffer&#x27;s frozen foods, and various office equipment and furniture companies.

Like many conglomerates, the company suffered significant declines in the 1970s, selling off many of its unrelated brands and had largely returned to its defense roots by the 1980s. The company continued to shrink after the ending of the Cold War and by the late 1990s was a corporate takeover target. The company was purchased by Northrop Grumman in 2001.

==History==

Litton Industries was originally established as an electronics company building navigation, communications and electronic warfare equipment. They diversified and became a much larger business, with major shipyards, and manufacturing microwave ovens.

It was founded in 1953 by American business executive Charles Bates &quot;Tex&quot; Thornton alongside his associates Roy Ash and Hugh Jamieson. Headquartered in Beverly Hills, California, the original name of the company was &#x27;Electro Dynamics Corporation.&#x27; In 1954, with a loan from the Lehman Brothers, Thornton acquired the vacuum tube producer &#x27;Litton Industries Inc&#x27; from its founder Charles Litton Sr. for $1.5 million and subsequently adopted its name.

Although Litton Industries lacked capital in the beginning, Thornton thought that the U.S. Department of Defense would need more sophisticated weapons and that the demand for another large electronics company would increase. During the years, Litton Industries acquired several other smaller companies and had merged with Monroe Calculating Machine. Monroe used Litton&#x27;s technological assets and Litton required Monroe&#x27;s sales and service outlets. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, 50% of Litton&#x27;s business was with the U.S. Government; besides calculators, they were also producing inertial guidance systems for aircraft, potentiometers, duplexers, etc.

In 1961, Litton acquired Ingalls Shipbuilding for $8 million and subsequently ventured into the production of submarines and oil-drilling equipment. By 1963, Litton Industries reached $500 million with a revenue of $393.8 million. 

In December 1964, Litton acquired Royal McBee.

In 1969, the company acquired Triumph-Adler, a major typewriter manufacturer based in Germany and the sixth-largest European office equipment manufacturer at the time.

In 1973, after several years of disappointing sales, Thornton replaced Ash with Fred O&#x27;Green as president of the company. With the new strategy, Litton sold some of its profit-losing subsidiaries and focused on the profitable ones. The company also succeeded to make a $1.6 billion deal with the Saudi Arabian Air Force.

The profits of the company increased from $44 million in 1979 to $78 million in 1983.

During the 1980s, Litton dropped its businesses in publishing, medical products, office furniture, and microwaves and shifted the production to sophisticated technology. As a result of that, the company bought the electronic firms Itek Corp. and Core Laboratories. In the early 1990s, Litton Industries split into separate military and commercial companies. The US$2 billion commercial business, which included Litton&#x27;s oilfield services, business, and automated assembly line operations, was named Western Atlas, Inc.

In 1998, Litton Industries bought TASC, Inc. In 2000, TASC sold three stand-alone commercial operations: Adesso Software, WSI (Weather Services International) Corporation and Emerge. The company reported sales of $5.6 billion and a net income of $218 million for the 2000 fiscal year. 

On December 21, 2000, in a joint statement, Litton Industries and Northrop Grumman announced that the latter will acquire Litton Industries shares in a transaction worth $5.1 billion. The transaction was completed on May 31, 2001 and Northrop Grumman officially acquired Litton Industries.

<text>Rachel&#x27;s Tears: The Spiritual Journey of Columbine Martyr Rachel Scott is a non-fiction book about Rachel Scott, the first victim of the Columbine High School massacre.

Written by her parents, including her journal entries, it is part of a nationwide school outreach program and ministry. They present Rachel as being killed for her Christian affirmation.

Darrell Scott traveled around the United States to promote the book. He said that during his travels he heard many stories about school death threats and that this compelled him to spread the message of his daughter. Scott said the number was &quot;by far, more than are reported in the media.&quot;

<text>Panzer Dragoon is a 1995 rail shooter game for the Sega Saturn, developed and published by Sega. It is the first game in the &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; series. The game follows hunter Keil Fluge, who becomes the rider of a powerful dragon. The player moves an aiming reticle (representing the dragon&#x27;s laser and Kyle&#x27;s gun) and shoots enemies while the dragon flies through 3D environments on a predetermined track.

As one of six games available at the Sega Saturn&#x27;s surprise North American launch, &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; was the first game created by Team Andromeda. It was also the directorial debut of Yukio Futatsugi, who was 25 years old at the time of release. &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; received positive reviews in 1995 and in retrospective coverage. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named it game of the month and the best Saturn game of the year, and named it the 140th-best game of all time in 2006. In particular, its art direction and post-apocalyptic universe gained acclaim.

&quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; was ported to Windows and PlayStation 2, and was followed by &quot;Panzer Dragoon II Zwei&quot; (1996) and &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot; (1998) for Saturn and &quot;Panzer Dragoon Orta&quot; (2002) for Xbox, which includes the original &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; as a bonus feature. A remake of &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; was developed by MegaPixel Studio and published by Forever Entertainment in 2020 for Nintendo Switch, Stadia, Windows, PlayStation 4, Amazon Luna and Xbox One.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; spans six levels, each lasting about five minutes, with a variety of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is revealed through cutscenes using the game&#x27;s own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.

The player has a full, 360-degree field of view, and can quickly look left, right, forward, and behind the dragon. Enemies come from all directions, varying in size and health, and also appear on an on-screen radar that monitors the dragon&#x27;s surroundings. Two weapons are available: the rider&#x27;s handgun, which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming reticle, and the homing laser fired by the dragon, which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the reticle over them while holding down the fire button. Some situations with many enemies on screen require the use of the lock-on laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient.

==Plot==
&quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; is set in the distant future, thousands of years after a great war between humans and their biologically engineered weapons, when humans live in everything from small tribes to large nations. One nation, the Empire, has discovered a black tower in the middle of a lake near their capital, which gave them access to large amounts of ancient weapons which they used to beat back and control the ever present monsters in the world. The Imperials were corrupted by this power and became conquerors of others as opposed to liberators from a violent world.

The introduction movie opens with the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases one of them to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon&#x27;s rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider&#x27;s quest.

During the first level of the game, Keil and his dragon fly through a drowned city, where they encounter a small Imperial patrol ship. That ship sends a report to a large fleet of ships flying above the clouds. It is revealed that the Imperial forces are specifically searching for the blue dragon. The second level is a desert, where Keil and the dragon encounter gigantic worm-like creatures. At the stormy edge of the desert, they are confronted by the Black Dragon, which is defeated and speeds away. The third level is a mountainous landscape at night-time where Keil and the dragon get reacquainted with the Imperial forces, which were exploring ancient ruins. These encounters illustrate the ongoing conflict between the Imperial forces and the ancient machines and creatures. The fourth level is an ancient facility in which Keil and the dragon are pursued by both Imperial airships and cybernetic sentinels left behind by the ancient civilization. During the fifth level, they defeat a large armada of the most powerful Imperial ships over a forested area. A cutscene then shows a fleet of dragon-like creatures coming out of the tower to attack the Imperial forces. The sixth level features the black dragon and Keil racing through the battle-scarred Imperial capital. During this, they are both waylaid by the creatures and machines seen attacking the Imperial fleet around the tower while also being fired on by Imperial defenses. The black dragon then reaches the Tower and is mutated into a gigantic super-dragon and begins a climactic battle with Keil and the blue dragon, after which the black dragon is defeated and falls into the ocean.

In the ending cutscene, Keil and the dragon enter the tower. While traveling down a long corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting him from the saddle and suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on to the core of the tower, then a blinding light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.

==Development==

&quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; was created in the early 1990s as the Japanese video game company Sega was preparing to release its Saturn console. In 1993, as the Saturn lacked third-party games, Sega asked its developers for game ideas; according to art director Manabu Kusunoki, Sega asked for shooting game ideas to add variety to the Saturn&#x27;s launch library. Twenty-three-year-old Yukio Futatsugi, who had joined Sega only two years before, proposed several concepts, including &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot;. Futatsugi became the head of Team Andromeda, a development team that Sega assembled for the project in early 1994 and was built around the duo formed by Futatsugi and Kusunoki. Development lasted almost a year, with a staff of 15.

The project was designed as arcade-style, as core members of the team like Kusunoki came from Sega&#x27;s arcade department. Team Andromeda wanted to create a fully 3D arcade game, having worked on similar games such as &quot;Out Run&quot; which were not truly 3D. With influences including &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, &quot;Starblade&quot;, &quot;Star Fox&quot;, and &quot;RayForce&quot;, the project became a 3D rail shooter. Usually, in 3D shooters, the player rides a 3D object like a jet fighter or a tank. Futatsugi and Kusunoki decided it would be more original for the player to ride an armored dragon, a living creature which would also allow for richer animations. The original concept for the game was named &quot;Armored Dragon&quot; (&quot;kikō-ryū&quot; in Japanese), but Futatsugi, feeling that this was too bland, decided to change it to the pseudo-German translation &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot;.

With this basic concept in mind, the creators had 3 months to define a visual identity and a setting for their game, prior to development. The game would be set in a post-apocalyptic science fantasy world, featuring ruins and relics of a fallen civilization with mankind rebuilding itself while surviving, enduring and so forth in that era of perdition. A theme presented in many anime series at that time. Futatsugi was particularly influenced by one of his childhood readings, &quot;The Long Afternoon of Earth&quot;, a science-fiction novel by Brian Aldiss, in which one side of the earth became perpetually hot, the other perpetually cold. The first presentation video featured a green dragon, in line with traditional European/medieval depictions, however the team quickly decided to change it and make it &quot;more sci-fi&quot;. In order for the dragon to be more original, it was made blue and covered in a white, bone-like armor. The dragon was supposed to come from the ancient times, so ruins and ancient flying technology also featured this white, shell-like material.

The overall fantasy look of the game&#x27;s world, which mixed natural and technological elements, was also chosen in order to set it apart from classic science-fiction 3D games of the time. This world, as well as dragon and character designs, were mainly the work of Manabu Kusunoki, who took inspiration from various sources, including anime and manga, and who pushed the art direction toward a more Turkish/Ottoman style to avoid the European aesthetics of the early presentation video. Critics have noted similarities with the works of French artist Moebius (notably his comic book &quot;Arzach&quot;,) of whom Kusunoki was a fan, as well as with Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, and David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; movie. Kentaro Yoshida, texturing and modeling artist, described the creation process as similar in style to &quot;Star Wars&quot;, in that it &quot;made an unearthly world appear so real&quot;. Takashi Iwade, in charge of the opening cutscene and character models, designed the enemies using a lot of various influences: &quot;I got inspiration from antique clocks and various industrial products from the era of the industrial revolution for mechanics, and myriapods, marine mollusks, ammonite, and a rusty fishing boat for creatures when I started thinking of the original battleship&quot;. The team wanted a famous artist to make the game&#x27;s cover art. Manabu Kusunoki suggested Moebius, who accepted, and the team sent him designs that he was to interpret. The resulting illustration was used as the cover art for the Japanese release of the game.

The Saturn&#x27;s hardware was new to the team, and it was their first attempt at creating an original environment. It was also Futatsugi&#x27;s first year working as a full developer at Sega, so he was only able to do simple things while having a clear vision of what he wanted, which helped him to keep the overall style pure, with stark and minimalist cutscenes. Similarly, Iwade kept the enemies easy to understand visually, with simple shapes, and this overall simple style ended up fitting well with the Saturn&#x27;s hardware. Then, Team Andromeda set to work on elaborating an extensive back story, and Futatsugi, to be original and to avoid using Japanese or English, went so far as to create a fictional language for the game: a mix of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian. This was apparently inspired by the anime &quot;The Wings of Honneamise&quot;, of which team members were fans and which also features an invented language.

After the story and art were established, the team set to work on the graphics. Working on new hardware proved difficult for the young team, and the game ended up missing the initial deadline given by Sega, which was the Saturn Japanese launch in November 1994. One of the problems was that the Saturn hardware was only finalized in mid-1994, and without actual Saturn prototype to test their progress, the programmers initially had to work with hypothetical hardware performance. Team Andromeda created its own graphics library and mapping tools instead of using Sega&#x27;s, in order to make the most of their first game on the new system. The game&#x27;s graphics and cutscenes were done with Softimage, and the 3D elements were programmed on SGI workstations using OpenGL. The programmers were eventually able to transition to the debug Saturn they had received, but the process was difficult and the game had a very low frame rate at first, before it increased to approx. 20 FPS. The six levels of &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; are barren landscapes with ancient ruins, which is consistent with the &quot;simple&quot; style appropriate for the Saturn. The first two levels that the team programmed, a desert (level 2) and a forest (level 5), did not have any objects or anything besides sand and forest effects, again because the team was unsure how far the hardware could be pushed. Keeping CPU limitations in mind, simple tornado effects were added to level 2, so that it did not look too bland.

Work on the soundtrack began after completion of the game, similar to the way movie soundtracks are made. The idea was to create music that would specifically reflect each level&#x27;s art-style and events. As the game had an &quot;on rails&quot; progression system, the developers knew exactly where the player would be at any given time, so they showed videos to the composer and asked him to write specifically timed pieces that would match the player&#x27;s progression in each level. The soundtrack was outsourced to Yoshitaka Azuma, who was composing music for NHK TV programs at that time. The music of &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; is a mix between orchestral and synthesizer tracks.

Sega of America made several alterations to the game to make the North American release more challenging. These alterations were retained in the PAL version.

==Releases==
&quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; was released in Japan on March 10, 1995, North America on May 11, 1995 as one of the six launch games for the North American release, and Europe on August 30, 1995, on the Sega Saturn console. It was followed by &quot;Panzer Dragoon II Zwei&quot; (1996) and &quot;Panzer Dragoon Saga&quot; (1998), both for Saturn, and &quot;Panzer Dragoon Orta&quot; (2002) for Xbox.

In 1996, &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; was ported to Windows. Identical to the Saturn version except with a higher resolution, this version was also included as a bonus in &quot;Panzer Dragoon Orta&quot;. Aside from providing the source code, Team Andromeda had no involvement in the development of the Windows version. It was sold bundled with the NV1 PCI Card. In 1997, a software rendered version was released, requiring at least an Intel Pentium P5 processor.

An updated version of &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; was included in the Japan-only &quot;Sega Ages 2500&quot; collection for PlayStation 2 in 2006. The port was handled by development studio Land Ho!, and features the original Saturn game and an &quot;arrange&quot; version with anti-aliasing filter, better texturing, and improved 3D models for the dragon and some enemies. The &quot;arrange&quot; version also adds unlockable extras such as level selection and artworks, in the form of a &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; option menu.

==Reception==
&quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; received positive reviews, both in 1995 and in retrospective coverage. Though sales were not as high as Sega expected, possibly due to the success of Sony&#x27;s PlayStation console over the Saturn, they were substantial enough for Sega to develop sequels.

As one of the first Saturn games, &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; was highly anticipated by journalists after its appearance in promotional material. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; said the game &quot;orchestrates incredible story animation with brilliant, 3D flight graphics to create what is, basically, the ultimate evolution of &quot;Space Harrier&quot;.&quot; He also highly praised the gameplay, particularly the variety of enemies, the difficulty slope, and the controls. Ed Semrad and Danyon Carpenter from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the game for its &quot;innovative game play&quot; and its &quot;awe-inspiring visuals&quot; from the opening cinematic to the backgrounds and the dragon&#x27;s animations. Al Manuel and Ken Williams criticized the game&#x27;s lack of diversity in weapons and its predetermined progression; but the four &quot;EGM&quot; reviewers agreed that it was a must-have game for Saturn owners. Similarly, The Unknown Gamer from &quot;GamePro&quot; called the game a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, highlighted its high-quality graphics and music, and described the story as &quot;captivat[ing]&quot;. However, the journalist noted the game&#x27;s overall difficulty &quot;will single out all but advanced players&quot; with its lack of power-ups or extra lives of any kind. Nevertheless, the game was seen as a good example of the Saturn&#x27;s capabilities. In contrast, a reviewer from &quot;Maximum&quot; said that the game was much too easy even on the highest difficulty setting, greatly reducing its already low longevity. He also said the gameplay would be too simplistic for many players, with its on-rails shooting and selection of only two weapons, but was overall very positive in his assessment of the game, highly praising the 360 degrees of rotation and most especially the textured 3D graphics of the enemies, settings, and bosses.

Patrick Baggatta from &quot;Game Players&quot; stated that while the game may come off as &quot;just a simple shooter&quot;, it is at least a &quot;very good one&quot; that &quot;puts a twist on the tired formula&quot;, again praising the game play and the variety in camera angles. Chris Gore from &quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; named the game &quot;the best shooter since &quot;Star Fox&quot;&quot;, and a must-have for fantasy and sci-fi fans, with its &quot;eerie&quot; atmosphere noted by editor Betty Hallock. While the story itself was said to be &quot;somewhat typical&quot; and editor Chris Bieniek criticized the on-rail aspect, Gore noted the game&#x27;s &quot;spectacular visuals&quot;, and presented it as one of the Saturn&#x27;s system sellers. &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine&#x27;s Reader Cross Review gave the game a 9 out of 10 in April 1995. The game&#x27;s universe itself was deemed &quot;coolly surreal&quot; by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer Albert Kim, who thought the game&#x27;s seven-minute &quot;movie-quality&quot; introduction was &quot;gorgeous&quot; and &quot;nearly overshadowed the game itself&quot;. Kim argued that &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; could be seen as a &quot;lyrical and exhilarating epic&quot;, a &quot;story, not just a game&quot; which could pave the way for a &quot;transformation&quot; of the videogame industry. Film director Steven Spielberg approached Team Andromeda to say he was impressed by the game&#x27;s presentation at the 1995 E3 show.

James Mielke from online game magazine &quot;1UP.com&quot; gave &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; a retroactive review of 8/10 for what the game offered in 1995, but gave it a modern score of 6/10. Mielke highlighted the music as &quot;one of the finest game soundtracks ever produced,&quot; but said that the game itself &quot;staggers a bit under the glaring light of a critical rereview[sic]&quot;, arguing it is &quot;little more than Space Harrier with a 3D camera and cut-scenes.&quot; By contrast, Levi Buchanan from &quot;IGN&quot; gave the game a retrospective score of 9/10, opining that &quot;the fact that Panzer Dragoon holds up as well in 2008 as it did in 1995 is a just testament to the staying power of good art and tight gameplay.&quot; Kurt Kalata, in a &quot;Gamasutra&quot; retrospective, also praised its art and universe, but said the actual game looked &quot;a bit cut and dried&quot; compared to its sequels.

Game developer Taro Yoko is a well known fan of the game.

=== Accolades ===
It was named &quot;Best Saturn Game of 1995&quot; by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; in their 1996 &quot;Buyers&#x27; Guide&quot;. &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; ranked 140th in &quot;EGM&quot;′s &quot;The Greatest 200 Videogames of their time&quot; feature published in 2006. In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the game 5th on their &quot;The GamesMaster Saturn Top 10.&quot;

== Remake ==
A remake of &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; was developed by MegaPixel Studio and published by Forever Entertainment in March 2020 for Nintendo Switch. It was released on Stadia on June 1, with Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Amazon Luna versions later in 2020.

The remake features updated graphics and an optional new control system that allows players to aim independently of movement with the second control stick. Switch reviewers criticized the updated controls and short length. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; concluded that it was &quot;a decent take on an all-time classic that goes some way to modernising it, but doesn&#x27;t quite nail the landing&quot;.

<doc id="599662" wikidata="Q78609" url="?curid=599662" title="Friedrich Welwitsch">
<text>Friedrich Martin Josef Welwitsch (25 February 1806 – 20 October 1872) was an Austrian explorer and botanist who in Angola was the first European to describe the plant &quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot;. His report received wide attention among the botanists and general public, comparable only to the discovery of two other plants in the 19th century, namely &quot;Victoria amazonica&quot; and &quot;Rafflesia arnoldii&quot;.

In Angola, Welwitsch also discovered &quot;Rhipsalis baccifera&quot;, the only cactus species naturally occurring outside the New World. It was found a few years later in Sri Lanka too, which reignited the now already one-and-a-half-century-old debate on the origin of cacti in Africa and Asia. At the time, the debate concluded with the conviction of numerous authors that they were introduced and spread by migratory birds.

Among the botanists, Welwitsch is also known after his descriptions of numerous other plants, for example &quot;Cyphostemma macropus&quot; (common name: Butter Tree), &quot;Tavaresia angolensis&quot; (common name: Devil&#x27;s Trumpet), &quot;Dorstenia psilurus&quot;, &quot;Sarcocaulon mossamedense&quot;, &quot;Acanthosicyos horridus&quot;, &quot;Pachypodium namaquanum&quot; and &quot;Pachypodium lealii&quot;. The earthstar fungus &quot;Geastrum welwitschii&quot;, a species he collected in Portugal, is named in his honor. 

Botanical specimens collected by Welwitsch are now found in herbaria around the world, including the Natural History Museum, London, Kew Herbarium, the National Museum of Natural History and the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.

==Biography==
Friedrich Welwitsch was born at Maria Saal (Slovene: Gospa Sveta), Duchy of Carinthia, Austrian Empire, to the wealthy family of Joseph Anton Welwich, a local judicial officer and town councillor of Salzburg, and Genovefa Mayr. The family name, which in today&#x27;s Slovene spelling would be &quot;Velbič&quot;, points at Slovene ethnicity. It is known that Welwitsch&#x27;s mother was a German, while his father&#x27;s family was probably of Slovene origin. However, this has not been definitely proven. It is not known whether Welwitsch spoke Slovene, although he worked as a physician in a Slovene-speaking environment for two years. This was in Postojna, where he continued to develop his interest in cryptogamic flora.

Contrary to the wishes of his father, who wanted him to study law, Friedrich Welwitsch studied medicine and botany in Vienna and worked as a physician in the Austrian provinces of Carniola and Moravia, but his interest in the plant kingdom, where he discovered a number of plants hitherto unknown, was so great that in 1839 he abandoned the medical profession altogether.

With the financial aid of a Württemberg botanical association Welwitsch travelled to Portugal where he became the director of the botanical gardens. His collections were distributed in 1841 by the Unio Itineraria as exsiccata-like series under the title &quot;Welwitschii iter Lusitanicum&quot;. His claim to fame came when with the further support of the Portuguese agent of the Württemberg botanical society he did research on the Canary Islands, on Madeira, and, in the interest of the Portuguese government, from 1853 in Angola, then a Portuguese colony. There, in 1859, in the Namib Desert in the southern part of Angola he discovered &quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot;, a unique member of the Gnetophyta, also known as &quot;Tumboa&quot;, with a subterranean stem of 50 cm diameter that can grow up to 30 meters deep, and with only two leaves of up to 2 m long, the longest-lived leaves (1,500 to 2,000 years) in the plant kingdom. This plant, whose common name is &quot;Tree tumbo&quot;, a single species of dioecious perennial, is considered a gymnosperm, however, the relationship with other species in this group is still not clear.

After eight strenuous years of exploring and collecting, Welwitsch returned to Portugal in 1861. Because of better working conditions, he went to London in 1863. There, he worked at first at the Natural History Museum and later at the Kew Gardens, categorising and cataloguing its enormous collection. Only in the publication &quot;Sertum Angolense&quot;, he described 12 new categories and 48 new species. He left his precious collection to the London Natural History Museum. However, having financed his Angolan years, the Portuguese government claimed the estate. The case was settled only after a three-year suit: one series of his collection went to Lisbon, the second remained in London. Welwitsch was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery where the slab over his grave reads: &quot;Frederikus Welwitsch, M.D. – Florae angolensis investigatorum princeps – Nat. in Carinthia 5 Feb 1806 – Ob. Londini 20 Oct 1872&quot;.

Welwitsch is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Angolan amphisbaenian, &quot;Dalophia welwitschii&quot;, and a species of African olive, &quot;Olea welwitschii&quot;.
