<doc id="591219" wikidata="Q3915520" url="?curid=591219" title="Korlai Portuguese Creole">
<text>Korlai Portuguese is an Indo-Portuguese creole based on the Portuguese language, spoken by approximately 1,000 inhabitants of the Korlai village at the Korlai fort, a former possession of the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay. Their speech is referred to as Korlai creole, Korlai Portuguese, Kristi or &quot;Nɔw-ling&quot; by the speakers themselves, which translates to &quot;our language&quot; in the creole. The speakers are a part of a very close-knit community, and refer to themselves as the &quot;Kristi&quot; community bound by their affiliation to the Christian denomination, of Roman Catholicism in India. Korlai is situated in the Raigad district (Colaba district) of the Konkan division named after the Colaba fort, 150 kilometers south of Mumbai (Bombay), in Maharashtra, India. The speakers are of a homogenous Roman Catholic pocket in an area otherwise dominated by Konkani Muslim and Hindu Marathi-Konkani speaking inhabitants.

== Development of Korlai Creole Portuguese ==
The development of the language can be traced back to the 1500s with the conception of the new element of society, the native Indian Catholics and Eurasian offspring. The existing caste system within India had a great influence on the creation of KCP (Korlai Creole Portuguese). The Eurasian offspring and the Indian-Eurasian offspring were isolated from the pure-blood Portuguese and other castes. This isolation led them to intermarry and children began learning the pidgin their parents spoke. The Korlai creole emerged among the slaves and their offspring who converted to Christianity and became a part of the Portuguese community while still adhering to existing caste distinctions.  The social isolation this community faced contributed to the maintenance and growth of Korlai creole.

In today&#x27;s context, the Kristi community is geographically separated from the rest as the community lives in the &#x27;varcha bhag&#x27; [Upper Korlai]. The community also differs from the rest of the area occupationally. Korlai Creole Portuguese speakers are agriculturists whereas the other dominant occupation is of fishers from the Koli, Mali, Agari and a few Maratha communities. Apart from the geographical and occupational differences, the Kristi community differentiates itself linguistically, by the use of &#x27;nɔ ling&#x27;, an important marker of their identity. However, with the changing times and better connectivity between Korlai and the rest of the world, the language evolving. The newer generation prefers the use of Marathi as it is dominant language of the state and the insistence of the Church in order to create unison. This is causing a huge influence of Marathi on the language and its development.

== Socio-historical Background ==
Chaul was an important trade city near Korlai and was first visited by the Portuguese in 1505. This area was previously under the Muslim rule from 1318. The Portuguese and the Muslim ruler maintained a friendly relation, however, the relation soon experienced tension and a war broke out. During this time 600 &quot;casados&quot;, i.e. Portuguese men married the native women who were living outside the Chaul fort along with a large number of Hindu and Muslim shopkeepers. In 1594, the Portuguese took over the fort along with Korlai in the valley of the &quot;marro&quot; (hill). By 1630, a small Christian community grew when the church, &quot;Nossa Senhora do Mar&quot; &#x27;Our Lady of the Sea&#x27; was built on the hill. The slaves and the offspring of the &quot;casados&quot; [Portuguese men] and &quot;soldadas&quot; [Soldiers] were mainly Christian converts. The Portuguese abandoned Chaul and the hill to move to Goa in 1740. After the departure of the Portuguese, many Christians moved to other Portuguese territories while the Christians of the lower-castes moved closer to the church as the Marathas took control of the region.

== Features of Korlai Creole Portuguese ==
Korlai Portuguese vowels are similar to the Middle Portuguese, which was spoken by Portuguese soldiers that came to the region. The sole difference being the point of articulation of the central vowel. Both Marathi and Korlai Creole Portuguese had a decline in nasal vowels and this process of denasalisation is connected for both languages. In the younger generation, Korlai Creole Portuguese also shows an increase in the borrowing of Marathi lexical items. Clements indicated that the language had SVO word order but recent data shows the language now utilizes a SOV word order, which could be attributed to increased influence of Marathi.

== Examples of Nɔ &quot;Ling&quot; ==

:Thanks a lot: &quot;Muit&#x27;obrigad!&quot; From Port. &quot;Muito Obrigado&quot;
:I: &quot;yo&quot;; From Port. &quot;eu&quot;
:You (singular): &quot;wo&quot;; From Port. &quot;vós&quot;
:You (formal): &quot;usé&quot;; From Port. &quot;você&quot;
:He and She: &quot;el&quot;; From Port. &quot;ele&quot; (he) and &quot;ela&quot; (she)
:We: &quot;no&quot;; From Port. &quot;nós&quot;
:You (plural): &quot;udzó&quot;; From Port. &quot;vós outros&quot;
:They: &quot;eló&quot;; from Port. &quot;eles outros&quot;
:Numerals: &quot;ũ, doy, tre, kwat, sink, sey, set, oyt, nob, dey&quot;; From Port. &quot;um, dois, três, quatro, cinco, seis, sete, oito, nove, dez&quot;
:First, Second: &quot;Primer, Sigun&quot;; From Port. &quot;Primeiro, Segundo&quot;

<text>Angolar Creole () is a Portuguese-based creole language of São Tomé and Príncipe, spoken in the southernmost towns of São Tomé Island and sparsely along the coast, especially by Angolar people. It is also called &quot;n&#x27;golá&quot; by its native speakers. It is a creole language with a majority Portuguese lexicon and a heavy substrate of a dialect of Kimbundu (port. Quimbundo), a Bantu language from inland Angola, where many had come from prior to being enslaved. It is rather different from Sãotomense, the other creole language spoken on the island.

== Description ==
It is a Portuguese-based creole language different from other Portuguese-based creole languages in Africa. The main difference is the substrate form Kimbundu and Kikongo from Angola.

== History ==
In the middle of the 16th century, a slave ship from Angola sunk before the southern coast of São Tomé. The surviving people aboard settled the coast as free fishermen. Their language was different from other creole language on the island. Today, between 10% and 20% of its linguistic elements are still of African origin.

European Portuguese is mostly spoken in formal situations, in the media, business, education, judicial system and legislature, while Angolar and Sao Tomean Portuguese are preferred for informal situations as a vernacular language in day-to-day life and daily activities, and code switching even occurs between Angolar, standard European Portuguese, and São Tomean Portuguese in informal speech.

<text>Carl Gustafs stads gevärsfaktori (English: Rifle Factory of Carl Gustaf&#x27;s Town) was a Swedish firearms manufacturer based in Eskilstuna, Sweden.

==History==
Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori (&quot;Rifle Factory of Carl Gustaf&#x27;s Town&quot;) was founded in 1812 as a state-owned arsenal. The name &quot;Carl Gustaf&#x27;s Town&quot; was used intermittently for the town of Eskilstuna after King Karl X Gustav gave the town city privileges.

Between 1943 and 1991, the factory was run by the state agency :sv:Försvarets Fabriksverk (FFV), and the whole complex was often referred to as FFV-Carl Gustaf.

In 1970, the Husqvarna Group sold its firearms manufacturing division, Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag, to FFV. FFV-Carl Gustaf continued to manufacture the Husqvarna 1900 hunting rifle and also developed that firearm into the Carl Gustaf 2000 series.

In 1999, Saab AB purchased the Celsius Group, the then parent company of FFV-Carl Gustaf. In September 2000, United Defense Industries (UDI) of the United States acquired Bofors Weapons Systems (the heavy weapons division), while Saab retained the missile interests.

BAE Systems acquired UDI and its Bofors subsidiary in 2005, and BAE Systems Bofors is now a business unit of BAE Systems AB; Saab Bofors Dynamics is a unit of Saab AB.

===Products===
Along with Husqvarna Vapenfabrik, Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori has provided the Swedish Army with small arms for over two centuries. There have been both foreign designs, such as the Remington M1867 rolling block and the Swedish Mauser rifles, as well as domestic designs such as the Ag m/42 semi-automatic rifle and the Kpist m/45 submachine gun.

In addition Bofors Carl Gustaf have produced a number of other weapons such as the m/42 Carl Gustaf 20mm recoilless rifle, the 20 mm m/45 autocannon and the famed 84 mm Carl Gustaf 8.4cm recoilless rifle, still one of the most common anti-tank weapons in the world.

The NIVA XM1970 (&quot;Nytt Infanteri Vapen&quot;, &quot;New infantry Weapon&quot;) was an experimental combined 5.56mm automatic rifle / 45mm recoilless rifle concept by FFV-Carl Gustaf during the early 1970s. It failed to attract any buyers and was abandoned.
The NIVA or &quot;Nytt infanterivapen&quot; (New Infantry Weapon) program was primarily intended to replace the Ak 4 battle rifle that was then in service with the Swedish Army. It was apparently also simultaneously intended to act as a lower cost alternative to use of the Carl Gustaf 8.4cm recoilless rifle. The automatic rifle section was of bullpup configuration with the 45mm recoilless rifle overhead. At least two prototypes were built and tested. Ultimately however, the XM1970 was not adopted by the Swedish military.

The company also produced the standard Swedish Army weapon, the Ak 5 automatic rifle. The Ak 5 is a modified version of the Fabrique Nationale 5.56 mm carbine FN FNC, produced with a folding stock and an option to mount the SUSAT sight from the British SA80.

<doc id="591228" wikidata="Q36520" url="?curid=591228" title="Principense Creole">
<text>Principense Creole (endonym: ) is a Portuguese-based creole language spoken in São Tomé and Príncipe, specifically the island of Príncipe. There are two Portuguese creoles on the island of São Tomé, Angolar and Forro. Today, younger generations of São Toméans are not likely to speak Principense, which has led to its fast decline and moribund status. It is mostly spoken by the elderly (Ethnologue gives a figure of approximately 200 native speakers in total), while most of the island&#x27;s community speaks noncreole Portuguese; some also speak another, closely related creole, Forro.

Principense presents many similarities with the Forro on São Tomé and may be regarded as a Forro dialect. Like Forro, it is a creole language heavily lexified by Portuguese with substrates of Bantu and Kwa.

During Roberts&#x27; freshman year in 1997, he batted .427, with 102 hits, including 24 doubles, and 47 stolen bases. His batting average was the second highest in the ACC. He was named to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association&#x27;s (NCBWA) Second Team and the &quot;Collegiate Baseball&quot; Third Team. During his sophomore year, he hit .353, with 13 home runs, 49 runs batted in (RBIs), 21 doubles, 63 stolen bases and was named to the NCBWA First Team, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Second Team and the &quot;Collegiate Baseball&quot; Second Team. His 63 stolen bases were more than any player in college baseball that year. He became the fifth Tar Heel to be named ACC player of the year, and was a first team All-America. In 1998, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Chatham A&#x27;s of the Cape Cod Baseball League.

Mike Roberts was fired after the 1998 season. After the firing, Brian opted to transfer to the University of South Carolina, to continue his college baseball career with the South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team. Starting at shortstop, Roberts was named the best defensive college player by &quot;Baseball America&quot;. Playing in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), he batted .353, hit 12 home runs, and collected 36 RBIs. He still owns the school and SEC record for stolen bases in a season with 67. He again was named an All-American and was a member of the All-SEC team.

==Professional career==

===Minor leagues===
Roberts was drafted by the Orioles in the first round (50th overall) of the 1999 MLB draft. He played for the Delmarva Shorebirds of the Class A South Atlantic League in , where he appeared in 47 games and hit .240 with 21 RBIs.

In , he started with the Gulf Coast League Orioles, batting .310 with a home run and 3 RBIs in nine games. He also played 48 games with the Frederick Keys of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League, hitting .301 with 16 RBIs.

In , Roberts spent parts of the season with the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings and the Double-A Bowie Baysox, batting a combined .277 with two home runs and 19 RBIs in 66 games.

===Baltimore Orioles===

====2001–05====

Roberts made his Major League debut for the Orioles on June 14, against the New York Mets, starting at shortstop and finishing the game 1-for-4. He played 75 games for Baltimore, batting .253 with two home runs and 17 RBIs.

In 2002, he played 38 games with the Orioles and batted .227 with a home run and 11 RBIs while stealing nine bases on 11 attempts. He also played 78 games with Triple-A Rochester, batting .275 with three home runs and 30 RBIs.

In 2003, he started for Ottawa, playing 44 games and hitting .315 with 15 RBIs. In late May, he was called up for injured second baseman Jerry Hairston Jr. He hit his first Major League grand slam in his second game (and his first in any sort of professional play) in the ninth inning against the Anaheim Angels to win that game. He finished with a .270 average, five home runs and 41 RBIs in 112 games, and stole 23 bases on 29 attempts (tied for eighth in American League).

The Orioles season started spring training in with both Hairston and Roberts on the roster. Hairston fractured his finger in spring training, however, and Roberts became the Opening Day starter. After Hairston returned from the disabled list, he was moved to right field, leaving Roberts at second base. In August, Roberts batted .346 with ten doubles in 107 at-bats. During the second week of August, Roberts was named the American League Player of the Week for hitting .531 over a span of six games. He finished 2004 with a .273 average, four home runs and 53 RBIs while collecting 175 hits in 159 games. He also hit 50 doubles, which led the American League and was third-best in the majors. His 50 doubles also broke the Orioles single-season record for doubles (originally set by Cal Ripken Jr.) and the single-season AL record for doubles by switch hitters.

Prior to the 2005 season, Hairston was traded to the Chicago Cubs (along with Oriole prospects Mike Fontenot and David Crouthers) for Sammy Sosa, thereby cementing Roberts&#x27;s position as the Orioles&#x27; starting second baseman. In 2005, Roberts led the AL in batting average for the first several months of the season. In addition, he showed an increase in power; prior to the 2005 season, he had only 12 career home runs, but by late June, he had already outmatched that total. Fans awarded Roberts explosive offensive first half by voting him the starting second baseman in the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It was Roberts&#x27; first appearance in the All-Star Game. As the season wore on, Roberts slumped and the Orioles slipped in the standings.

On September 20, 2005, Roberts dislocated his elbow in a game against the New York Yankees. The injury occurred in a collision with New York&#x27;s Bubba Crosby at first base in the bottom of the second inning, and resulted in Roberts missing the rest of the season.

====2006–09====
Roberts rebounded from his 2005 injury with a strong 2006 campaign. He played in 138 games, batting .286 with 10 home runs and 55 RBIs, while also scoring 85 runs. He stole 36 bases in 43 attempts, and hit seven home runs in the last two months of the season. Roberts spent the early part of May on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left groin. He was activated on May 24.

Roberts played in over 150 games for the Orioles in 2007. Along with teammate Nick Markakis, he finished in the AL top 10 for at-bats, batting .290 with 12 home runs, 57 RBIs, and a .377 OBP on the way to his second All-Star berth. His 50 stolen bases, a career high, was tied with Carl Crawford for the AL lead; Roberts also set career marks in hits and walks.

On June 24, 2008, Roberts went 3-for-5 against the Cubs in a 7–5 victory. His third hit of the game was his 1,000th career base hit. He collected the 250th double of his career on July 28 against the New York Yankees. On September 21, 2008, Roberts grounded into the final out in the history of Old Yankee Stadium.

The Orioles and Roberts agreed to a four-year contract extension worth $40 million on February 20, 2009. The contract secured Roberts through the 2013 season. Following an injury to Boston Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, Roberts was added to Team USA&#x27;s roster for the World Baseball Classic. Roberts batted .438 with one home run, two runs batted in and one stolen base in four games as the United States lost in the semifinals to Japan.

On August 4, in a game against the Detroit Tigers, Roberts hit his 300th career double in the first inning off of Jarrod Washburn. On September 15, he broke his own Orioles franchise record by hitting his 52nd double of the season. According to Spencer Fordin, &quot;the two-time All-Star became one of four players all-time – along with Hall of Famers Tris Speaker, Paul Waner, and Stan Musial – to amass three 50-double seasons in his career.&quot;

On September 29, Roberts hit his 56th double of the season against the Tampa Bay Rays, setting the all-time single season mark for doubles in a season by a switch-hitter. His 56 doubles led the majors in 2009. On October 3, Roberts was named &quot;Most Valuable Oriole&quot; for 2009 and awarded an engraved lead trophy for his accomplishments.

====2010–13 ====
Roberts missed much of spring training in 2010 with a herniated disc in his lower back. He recovered in time for Opening Day, but started the season 2-for-14 (.143) before suffering an abdominal strain stealing second base and being forced onto the 15-day disabled list, effective as of April 10. On July 12, Roberts began to play in rehab games without having a setback, as it is the first time he has been on the field since April 10. On July 23, Roberts returned to the Orioles&#x27; lineup for the first time since April 9.
Roberts suffered a concussion on September 27, 2010, after he hit himself in the head with his baseball bat out of frustration. He suffered his second concussion on May 16, 2011, when he slid into first base headfirst and hit the back of his head. He did not return for the remainder of the season.

Through the beginning of the season, Roberts continued his stay on the disabled list, but traveled with the team and remained an active member of the dugout. On May 22, Buck Showalter announced Roberts would be starting his rehab stint with the Double-A Bowie Baysox. His final five rehab games were played with the Triple A Norfolk Tides. Roberts returned to the Orioles on June 12, 2012, starting at second base and finishing the game 3-for-4 in an 8–6 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. However, a groin strain returned him to the disabled list on July 3, and after a brief attempt at another rehab assignment, he elected to have season-ending hip surgery on July 29 in hopes to return fresh to spring training in 2013.

In spring training in 2013, Roberts reported that he was free of the post-concussion syndrome resulting from his 2011 concussion. On April 4, during the Orioles&#x27; third game of the season, Roberts ruptured a tendon behind his right knee while stealing second base in the ninth inning of a 6–3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. He was placed on the 15-day DL, with an expected downtime of three to four weeks. Roberts was activated from the disabled list on June 30. In 77 games with the Orioles, he batted .249 with eight home runs and 39 RBIs.

====Steroid allegations====
On September 30, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that during a June 6, 2006, federal raid, former relief pitcher Jason Grimsley named Roberts as a user of anabolic steroids. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that Roberts was one of five names blacked out in an affidavit filed in federal court. However, on October 3, 2006, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that San Francisco United States attorney Kevin Ryan said that the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; report contained &quot;significant inaccuracies.&quot; On December 20, 2007, the actual names in the Grimsley search warrant affidavit were revealed to the public. Roberts, Jay Gibbons, Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens were not actually named in the report and Miguel Tejada was named only for having a conversation about amphetamines. Roberts, along with the other four players named, denounced the story. Roberts was subsequently named in George Mitchell&#x27;s report on performance-enhancing drugs. According to page 158 of the Mitchell Report, Roberts lived with then-teammate Larry Bigbie in David Segui&#x27;s house near the end of the 2001 season. Bigbie and Segui were regular steroid users; while they were using the performance-enhancing drugs and Roberts was present, he asserted that he did not participate. According to Bigbie&#x27;s testimony, Roberts told him in 2004 that he had injected himself with steroids &quot;once or twice&quot; in 2003.

On December 17, 2007, Roberts released a statement in which he admitted to using steroids on a single occasion.
&quot;In 2003, when I took one shot of steroids&quot;, he said. &quot;I immediately realized that this was not what I stood for or anything that I wanted to continue doing. I never used steroids, human growth hormone or any other performance-enhancing drugs prior to or since that single incident.

&quot;I can honestly say before God, myself, my family and all of my fans, that steroids or any performance-enhancing drugs have never had any effect on what I have worked so hard to accomplish in the game of baseball.&quot;
Roberts further stated that he had no ill-will against Larry Bigbie, whose testimony to the Mitchell Committee was responsible for his inclusion in the report.

===New York Yankees===
Roberts became a free agent for the first time in his career after the 2013 season. Roberts agreed to a one-year contract with the New York Yankees worth $2 million, which had incentives that could have raised the deal’s value to $4.6 million On August 1, 2014, Roberts was designated for assignment by the Yankees, and he was released on August 9. In 91 games with the Yankees, Roberts batted .237 with five home runs, 21 RBIs, and seven stolen bases.

==Retirement and broadcasting work==
On October 17, 2014, Roberts announced his retirement from professional baseball. He issued a statement that said that he felt like he could not play well anymore.

Roberts joined the Baltimore Orioles Radio Network prior to the 2018 season as a part-time color analyst.

==Personal life==
In January 2009, he married Diana Chiafair. They had their first child, Jax Isaac, in August 2013.

<text>Ottmar Liebert (born 1 February 1959) is a German guitarist, songwriter and producer best known for his Spanish-influenced music. A five-time Grammy Award nominee, Liebert has received 38 Gold and Platinum certifications in the United States, as well as certifications in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. His debut album &quot;Nouveau Flamenco&quot; (1990) was certified Platinum in the United States.

==Early life==
Ottmar Liebert was born 1 February 1959 in Cologne, West Germany, to a Chinese-German father and a Hungarian mother. As a child, he spent most of his time travelling throughout Europe and Asia with his family. He began playing classical guitar at 11, and studying flamenco guitar at 14, after he &quot;found a Flamenco LP in the bargain bin at a local supermarket.&quot; After performing rock music in his native Germany, he moved to the United States and settled in Boston for a few years, performing in various rock clubs. In 1986 Liebert settled in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he began looking to create a new musical sound.

Liebert cites musical influences such as &quot;Carlos Santana, Paco de Lucía, John McLaughlin, Robert Fripp and Jeff Beck, others were horn players like Miles Davis,&quot; although he cites &quot;others yet were fine artists who taught me about space and brush strokes and dynamics and contrast.&quot;

==Music career==

In 1988, Liebert founded the first incarnation of his band Luna Negra (black moon). That year he recorded a self-produced album titled &quot;Marita: Shadows and Storms&quot;. The initial thousand copies were sold in the gallery of Santa Fe artist Frank Howell. When the record found its way to radio stations and began generating a response among listeners, Higher Octave Music picked it up and released a remastered version titled &quot;Nouveau Flamenco&quot; (1990). The album eventually sold double-platinum in the United States.

Liebert followed up his debut with several successful albums that continued and expanded his sound, including &quot;Borrasca&quot; (1991), &quot;Solo Para Ti&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Hours Between Night + Day&quot; (1993), all three earning Gold certification. Liebert&#x27;s international success continued with &quot;¡Viva!&quot; (1995) and &quot;Opium&quot; (1996), both of which earned Platinum status in the United States and Latin America.

Liebert has recorded with Luna Negra since 1989. Personnel in the band have changed regularly since then, with the only constant being bassist Jon Gagan.

Since 1990, Ottmar Liebert has released a total of 25 albums including live releases, Christmas CDs, 15 CDs of original music, a DVD, and various remixes. He has received 38 Gold and Platinum certifications in the US as well as certifications in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

In 2006, Liebert contributed his song &quot;This Spring Release 10,000 Butterflies&quot; to the album project Artists for Charity - Guitarists 4 the Kids, produced by Slang Productions, to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged kids in need.

==Nouveau Flamenco==
Liebert describes his musical style as &quot;Nouveau Flamenco.&quot; In a 2004 interview, Liebert explained that once he was signed to a record label, he was required to come up with a name for what he was doing. Although there are flamenco elements to his music, it&#x27;s nothing like traditional flamenco, being based on melody and using much simpler forms. As this music couldn&#x27;t be considered jazz, rock, or classical, he felt that flamenco was the closest word to use that people could identify with.

Liebert drew some criticism with his adoption of the term, especially since according to critics, none of his works to date followed traditional flamenco palo forms. It was also perceived by some as a marketing ploy and an attempt to associate his music with the then burgeoning school of &quot;Flamenco Nuevo&quot;, where acknowledged flamenco artists had started to rejuvenate and reinvent flamenco through the introduction of influences from Latin America (e.g. the Rumba rhythm) and even jazz music. Paco de Lucia was one such critic. Despite Liebert&#x27;s citing Paco as an influence, Paco described Liebert&#x27;s music as &quot;una degeneración, una caricatura del flamenco&quot; (literally, &quot;a degeneration, a caricature&quot;). However, Paco later seemed to appreciate Liebert&#x27;s music, with Paco&#x27;s record company even mentioning him in promotional materials.

==Personal life==
Since 1986 Liebert has lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In May 2006 Liebert was ordained as a Zen monk by Dennis Genpo Merzel at the Kanzeon Zen Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.

<doc id="591239" wikidata="Q35785" url="?curid=591239" title="Macanese Patois">
<text>Macanese patois (endonym: ) is a Portuguese-based creole language with a substrate from Cantonese, Malay and Sinhala, which was originally spoken by the Macanese community of the Portuguese colony of Macau. It is now spoken by a few families in Macau and in the Macanese diaspora.

UNESCO &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot; classifies Patua as a &quot;Critically Endangered&quot; and places the number of speakers at 50 .

==Name==
The language is also called by its speakers as (&quot;Christian speech of Macau&quot;) and has been nicknamed (&quot;Sweet Language of Macau&quot;) and (&quot;sweet speech&quot;) by poets. In Chinese it is called &quot;&quot; (&quot;Macanese native-born native language&quot;). In Portuguese, it is called , (&quot;pure Macanese&quot;), or (from French ).

The terms &quot;&quot; (&quot;Macanese speak&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Macanese native-born native language&quot;) in Chinese (Cantonese), the lingua franca of Macau, refers to any language of Macau (such as the Tanka dialect of Yue Chinese, Standard Cantonese with Macau unique phrases and expressions, Macanese, Portuguese with Macau accent, Hakka, etc.) and the Macanese language, respectively. Although there have been attempts by the Portuguese Macau government in the mid-1990s to redefine the Portuguese and English term &quot; as Macau Permanent Resident (anyone born in Macau regardless of ethnicity, language, religion or nationality), in accordance with the Chinese (Cantonese) usage, this did not succeed. Consequently, the Portuguese and English term &quot; refers neither to the indigenous people of Macau (Tanka people) nor to the demonym of Macau, but to a distinctive ethnicity (1.2% of the population) special to Macau.

== History ==

===Origins===

Patuá arose in Macau after the territory was leased by Portugal in the mid-16th century and became a major hub of the Portuguese naval, commercial, and religious activities in East Asia.

The language developed first mainly among the descendants of Portuguese settlers. These often married women from Portuguese Malacca, Portuguese India and Portuguese Ceylon rather than from neighbouring China, so the language had strong Malay and Sinhala influence from the beginning. In the 17th century, it was further influenced by the influx of immigrants from other Portuguese colonies in Asia, especially from Portuguese Malacca, Indonesia, and Portuguese Ceylon, that had been displaced by the Dutch expansion in the East Indies, and Japanese Christian refugees.

===Evolution===
Like any other language, Macanese underwent extensive changes in usage, grammar, syntax, and vocabulary over the centuries, in response to changes in Macau&#x27;s demographics and cultural contacts. Some linguists see a sharp distinction between the &quot;archaic&quot; Macanese, spoken until the early 19th century, and the &quot;modern&quot; form that was strongly influenced by Cantonese. The modern version arose in the late 19th century, when Macanese men began marrying Chinese women from Macau and its hinterland in the Pearl River delta. The British rule of Hong Kong from the mid-19th century also added many English words to the lexicon.

Over its history the language also acquired elements from several other Indian tongues and a string of other European and Asian languages. These varied influences made Macanese a unique &quot;cocktail&quot; of European and Asian languages.

Macanese lawyer and Patuá supporter Miguel Senna Fernandes has said that Patuá was &quot;not yet dead, but the archaic form of Patuá has already died,&quot; adding that &quot;modern&quot; Patuá could be considered a &quot;dialect derived from archaic Patuá.&quot; He also underlined the fact that &quot;modern&quot; Patuá has been strongly influenced by Cantonese, namely since the beginning of the 20th century, adding that it was &quot;quite a miracle&quot; that Patuá has been able to survive for four centuries in Macau, considering that &quot;Chinese culture is quite absorbing.&quot;

&quot;Let&#x27;s revive an almost lost memory,&quot; Fernandes said about efforts by Patuá aficionados to ensure the survival of Macau&#x27;s &quot;sweet language&quot; that, after all, is part of its unique history.

===Cultural importance===

The language played an important role in Macau&#x27;s social and commercial development between the 16th and 19th centuries, when it was the main language of communication among Macau&#x27;s Eurasian residents. However, even during that period the total number of speakers was relatively small, probably always amounting to just thousands, not tens of thousands of people.

Macanese continued to be spoken as the mother tongue of several thousand of people, in Macau, Hong Kong and elsewhere, through 19th and early 20th century. At that time, Macanese speakers were consciously using the language in opposition to the standard Portuguese of the metropolitan administration. In the early 20th century, for example, it was the vehicle of satirical sketches poking fun at Portuguese authorities. A few writers, such as the late poet José dos Santos Ferreira (&quot;Adé&quot;), chose the &quot;sweet language&quot; as their creative medium.

On the other hand, Macanese never enjoyed any official status, and was never formally taught in Macau. Starting in the late 19th century, its role in the life of the colony was greatly diminished by the central government&#x27;s drive to establish standard Portuguese throughout its territories. High-society Macanese gradually stopped using it in the early 20th century, because of its perceived &quot;low class&quot; status as a &quot;primitive Portuguese&quot;. All people, including many Chinese learning Portuguese as their second or third language, are required to learn standard European Portuguese. Other Macanese people learn Cantonese, another language with co-official status with Portuguese in Macau. Because of this, code switching even occurs between the Creole, standard Portuguese, and Cantonese in informal speech.

===Present status===
Macanese use was already in decline while Macau was a Portuguese territory, and that situation is unlikely to improve now that the territory is under Chinese administration. Still, its speakers take great pride in the fact that Macau has its own local language, something that Hong Kong does not have. They argue that Macau&#x27;s unique status as a 500-year-old bridge between Orient and the Occident justifies deliberate efforts to preserve the Macanese language. The language is included in UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot;.

In spite of its unique character and centuries-old history, Macanese has received scant attention from linguists. Philologist Graciete Nogueira Batalha (1925–1992) published a number of papers on the language. A Macanese-Portuguese glossary was published in 2001.

In the 21st century, some younger Macanese are making efforts to rejuvenate Patuá, especially by using it in original music and drama.

== Geographic distribution ==

Macanese is the now nearly extinct native language of the so-called Macanese people, Macau&#x27;s Eurasian minority, which presently comprises some 8,000 residents in Macau (about 2% of its population), and an estimated 20,000 emigrants and their descendants, especially in Hong Kong, Brazil, California, Canada, Peru, Costa Rica, Australia, Portugal and Paria peninsula of Venezuela. Even within that community, Macanese is actively spoken by just several dozen elderly individuals, mostly women in their eighties or nineties, in Macau and Hong Kong, and only a few hundred people among the Macanese Diaspora overseas, namely in California.

== Description ==

===Classification and related languages===
Macanese is a creole language, that is, the result of a fusion of several languages and local innovations that became the mother tongue of a community. As such, it is difficult to classify within any major family.

Because of its historical development, it is closely related to other Portuguese- and Malay-influenced creoles of Southeast Asia, notably the Kristang language of Malacca and the extinct Portuguese-influenced creoles of Indonesia and Flores, as well as to the Indo-Portuguese creoles of Sri Lanka and India.

===Lexicon===

====Malay====
A sizeable amount of the Macanese lexicon derives from Malay, through various Portuguese-influenced creoles (&quot;papiás&quot;) like the Kristang of Malacca and the creole spoken in the Indonesian island of Flores. Words of Malay origin include (&quot;coin; money&quot;), (&quot;butterfly&quot;), and (&quot;coconut milk&quot;).

====Sinhala &amp; South Asian languages====
Many words also came from Sinhala, through the Indo-Portuguese creoles of the Kaffir and Portuguese Burgher communities of Sri Lanka. Some terms are derived from other Indian languages through other Indo-Portuguese creoles brought by natives of Portuguese India, these include Konkani and Marathi languages. Examples of words from these sources include (&quot;flower&quot;) and (&quot;vermicelli&quot;).

====Dutch====
A few words in Macanese also come from Dutch, likely through Malay or Indonesian. An example is (&quot;toilet, outhouse&quot;) deriving from Dutch , probably via Indonesian .

====Japanese====
There are also a few words in common Macanese use that are ultimately of Japanese origin, for example (&quot;soy sauce&quot;), possibly derived from (), a regional dish from Shirakawa prepared by mixing stone-ground soybeans with a miso and soy-sauce-based broth. Such words may have entered Macanese through the Japanese Catholic population which settled in the Pátio do Espinho during the 17th and 18th centuries. For instance, (&quot;salt and soybean paste&quot;), from Japanese miso, was recorded in the &quot;Ou-Mun Kei-Leok&quot; published in 1751.

====Cantonese====
Cantonese contributions include (&quot;(Chinese) girl&quot;) coming from (&quot;little sister&quot;) and (&quot;gift of cash&quot;) coming from (&quot;red packets&quot;). 

In some cases, there may be two words in Macanese meaning the same thing but of different origins, for example (from Portuguese ) and (from Cantonese ) both meaning &quot;bread&quot;. In this particular case, is the more common word, however this may vary with other cases. In addition, is also used in some fixed phrases, such as (lit. &quot;home bread&quot;), a type of sweet bread that is/was typically baked at home by Macanese.

In addition to directly borrowing words, one somewhat common feature is the calquing of phrases from Cantonese into Macanese, for example (negative imperative particle, &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;) derived from Portuguese (&quot;it is not good&quot;), but actually semantically being a calque of (&quot;don&#x27;t&quot;, lit. &quot;not good&quot;).

Some words may be derived from (Indo-)Portuguese but take on senses of related words from Cantonese, for example (&quot;to faint; to feel dizzy&quot;) originally coming from Indo-Portuguese (&quot;drunk; high&quot;) but being supplanted semantically by Cantonese (&quot;dizzy; to feel dizzy&quot;); or (&quot;car; any kind of vehicle&quot;) coming from Portuguese (&quot;cart&quot;) but being semantically supplanted by Cantonese , with the same meaning as the Macanese term. Even the word for &quot;money&quot;, &quot;sapeca&quot;, may be a semantic loan from Cantonese , as the term used to only refer to coins with square holes in the middle (compare French cognate sapèque).

Aspiration is usually not taken into account when loaning Cantonese words into Macanese, that is, words with , , (Jyutping: ) and , , (Jyutping: ) are both borrowed as , making the aspirated consonants [, , ] assimilate to the unaspirated ones. For example, 「&quot;算盤&quot;」 (Jyutping: &quot;syun3 pun4&quot;) and 「&quot;麵包&quot;」(Jyutping: &quot;min6 baau1&quot;) are borrowed into Macanese as &quot;sin-pun&quot; and &quot;min-pau&quot; respectively, noting that both words use ⟨p⟩ as opposed to the latter being borrowed as &quot;*min-bau&quot;. Likewise, [t͡s] (Jyutping: &quot;z&quot;) and [t͡sʰ] (Jyutping: &quot;c&quot;) are usually both borrowed into Macanese as &quot;ch&quot;, for example 「&quot;瓜子&quot;」 (Jyutping: &quot;gwaa1 zi2&quot;) and「&quot;吵吵鬧鬧&quot;」(Jyutping: caau2 caau2 naau6 naau6&quot;) are borrowed into Macanese as &quot;quachí&quot; and chau-chau-lau-lau&quot; respectively, rather than the former being borrowed as &quot;*guazí&quot;. Note however that the syllable-initial N-L alternation as displayed by 「&quot;鬧&quot;」 in 「&quot;吵吵鬧鬧&quot;」 (naau6&quot; → lau&quot;) is a regular allophonic phenomenon in Cantonese, rather than a specific effect arisen from the Macanese orthographic merging of aspirants and non-aspirants.

====English====
English-derived terms include (from &quot;hard-up&quot;, meaning &quot;short of money&quot;), (&quot;fat&quot;), (&quot;honeydew (melon)&quot;), and possibly (&quot;store&quot;, &quot;shop&quot; from Malay , but also the sense &quot;downstairs&quot; possibly deriving from English &quot;go down&quot;).

There are also a few terms calqued from English, for example (&quot;an important person&quot;) being a calque of &quot;big shot&quot;.

Older terms may have entered Macanese through Indo-Portuguese, for example (&quot;to have lunch&quot;) coming from English &quot;tiffin&quot; which is an especially commonplace term in Indian English, while newer English-derived terms have almost certainly entered Macanese through Hong Kong English, such as or in the sense of &quot;stamp&quot; or &quot;seal&quot;, which is not only found in Hong Kong English but also in Hong Kong Cantonese.

====Portuguese====
The Portuguese contribution to the lexicon came mainly from the dialects of southern Portugal. For example, (&quot;to call&quot;) likely deriving from a dialectal variant of standard Portuguese .

Otherwise, verbs derived from Portuguese tend to lose their endings. , and usually become , and . In some cases, verbs may be derived from the first- or third-person singular present form rather than the infinitive, for example (&quot;to live&quot;) coming from Portuguese (&quot;I live, I am living&quot;) rather than the infinitive . Likewise, (&quot;to come&quot;) and (&quot;to have&quot;) deriving from Portuguese (&quot;he/she/it/they (sg.) is/are coming&quot;) and (&quot;he/she/it/they (sg.) have&quot;), rather than the infinitives and , which would have yielded &quot;*ví&quot; and &quot;*tê&quot;. On the other hand, compare (&quot;to laugh&quot;) and (&quot;to believe&quot;) from Portuguese and respectively. Depending on the age of a Macanese derivation, it may also lose after a consonant as well, for example Portuguese became Macanese (&quot;to write&quot;).

Some Macanese formations are derived from Portuguese (or older Galician-Portuguese) terms that are not found in modern standard Portuguese, for example (negative future particle, &quot;will not&quot;) deriving from Portuguese (&quot;(there) will not be&quot;). Portuguese words may also be used in different and/or expanded senses, for example (Portuguese &quot;never&quot;) being used with a more general sense of &quot;not&quot; as well as the interjection &quot;no&quot;, while (lit. &quot;no if&quot;) is used for &quot;never&quot;; or (from Portuguese , &quot;to look&quot;) also bearing the meanings of &quot;to see&quot;, &quot;to watch&quot;, and even sometimes &quot;to understand&quot;. There are also some particles found in Macanese which are not found in modern Portuguese, but which survives in other Romance languages; for example, or (&quot;just; only; no more&quot;) corresponding to Asturian , Catalan , Romanian , and Latin American Spanish .

Some words with now-obsolete senses in Portuguese may retain those senses in Macanese. For example, means &quot;quickly&quot; in Macanese, and derives from Portuguese , which is speculated to have gone out of common Portuguese use after the 18th century. Depending on the case, Portuguese slang and jargon word variants may become the most common form used in Macanese, for example (&quot;police officer&quot;) derived from Portuguese .

In addition to inherited terms from Indo-Portuguese, it is also speculated that Macanese has been influenced by Portuguese varieties and creoles spoken in Africa. For example, Portuguese (&quot;fair, just&quot;) becomes in Macanese, very similar in form to the Kabuverdianu (&quot;correct&quot;), also descended from the same Portuguese word.

In some cases, non-Portuguese terms may be combined with Portuguese-derived grammatical particles to form terms unique to Macanese, for example English &quot;park&quot; + Macanese (from Portuguese ) → (&quot;to park (a vehicle)&quot;). Conversely, Portuguese-derived terms may also combine with non-Portuguese grammatical particles to form Macanese terms, for example (Macanese, Portuguese &quot;love&quot;) + Cantonese (diminutive suffix) → (&quot;sweetie, darling&quot;). 

Depending on the scenario, some speakers may perform code-switching, where certain (usually more complicated) concepts are expressed using Portuguese; or Portuguese interjections may be used in a Macanese sentence, for example (&quot;it&#x27;s so hot&quot;, lit. &quot;heat asking for mercy&quot;), where comes from Portuguese. Otherwise, nationalities and names of countries are generally directly borrowed from Portuguese. 

In Macanese, to speak in a Portuguese-influenced manner, i.e. to use Portuguese expressions or a Portuguese accent, is referred to as or , which for instance may be used in the phrase (&quot;to speak in a Portuguese way&quot;).

Where Portuguese has influenced Macanese, Macanese may also influence the Portuguese dialect as spoken by ethnic Macanese. Reportedly, words like (&quot;troublemaker&quot;) and (&quot;fainted&quot;) may be used by (especially older) Macanese when speaking Portuguese.

====Spanish====

Some words were also derived from Spanish. Words of Spanish origin came via a small number of Latinos who settled in the ports of Macau amidst the Manila Galleon trade. Because Spanish and Portuguese are both Iberian Romance languages, many words may be similar and the real origin may not be clear. For instance, (&quot;goodbye&quot;) may directly derive from the Spanish with no apparent intermediate in Portuguese ; or (&quot;joke&quot;) deriving from Galician or Spanish . Some words may instead derive from Spanish via Portuguese, for instance (&quot;to take&quot;) from Spanish via Portuguese ; or (&quot;teacup&quot;) from Spanish (ultimately of Nahuatl origin) via Portuguese .

While certain de-diphthongized words exist in forms similar to their Spanish counterparts, such as Portuguese (&quot;two&quot;) becoming in Macanese (compare Spanish ), it is uncertain the extent to which Spanish may have actually influenced said de-diphthongization process, and the similar resultant vowel may largely be a coincidence.

====Backslang====

There is also some backslang in Macanese, for example deriving from , both meaning &quot;a Chinese thing/person&quot;.

===Phonology===
The phonology of Macanese is relatively similar to European Portuguese, however there is a slightly tonal or sing-songy quality, possibly as an influence of Malay and/or Cantonese. Unlike Cantonese however, the tones largely do not differentiate otherwise homophones. In addition, spoken Macanese appears to be syllable-timed, like Brazilian Portuguese, but unlike European Portuguese which is stress-timed.

====Consonants====
⟨s⟩ before a consonant or word-finally may be pronounced either as or , the latter a feature influenced by European Portuguese. The usage of is recorded at least as early as the 1980s, as recorded in the (1988). ⟨s⟩ between vowels is usually pronounced , same as in Portuguese; and word-initial ⟨s⟩ followed by a vowel, ⟨-ss-⟩, and ⟨ç⟩ are all pronounced .

Portuguese ⟨lh⟩ tends to become just , for example Macanese (&quot;woman&quot;) derived from Portuguese , although the variation also exists, cf. Kristang . In some cases, this may be due to Macanese inheriting directly from Old Galician-Portuguese ⟨ll⟩. however is generally retained, for example (&quot;snout&quot;) from Portuguese , although some speakers may use instead.

Also, and generally tend to be pronounced as and respectively, although is always used for words of Cantonese or Malay origin containing ( in Malay, or in Cantonese). Another difference is that is almost exclusively pronounced as (or even un-aspirated as in Cantonese), as opposed to in European Portuguese or in Brazilian Portuguese in certain positions.

⟨h⟩ is treated differently depending on the borrowing source (if any); for Portuguese words, it is generally spelled but not pronounced in full Portuguese words, for example from Portuguese , but tends to be dropped in compound words, e.g. from Portuguese . For English words, the ⟨h⟩ is also silent, but is generally also not written out at all, for example from &quot;honeydew&quot;, or from &quot;humbug&quot;. The only case in which ⟨h⟩ is not silent is with Cantonese loanwords, for example from Cantonese (Jyutping: ). In this case, ⟨h⟩ is simply pronounced , a sound familiar to almost all Macanese, as modern Macanese still living in Macau are all proficient in Cantonese to some degree.

====Vowels====
In terms of vowels, the first syllable in Macanese is usually pronounced openly even when unstressed. For example, (from Portuguese ) is pronounced rather than , as if it were spelt . This however does not apply to unstressed final vowels; unstressed ⟨o⟩ in the final syllable of a word is generally still pronounced as . And as seen with the example of , if non-final shifts to in a Macanese word, it is almost always reflected in spelling. Similarly, if non-final shifts to , it is often (but not always) reflected in spelling, e.g. Macanese from Portuguese , or from Portuguese .

The pronunciation of nasal vowels may differ between different speakers, as there is no standardized pronunciation; for example, (&quot;to be&quot;, from Portuguese (&quot;they (pl.) are&quot;) may be pronounced either as or , hence the alternative spelling . is more common.

⟨a⟩ and ⟨â⟩ are usually but not always pronounced as /a/, even in stressed positions; for example, &quot;reportâ&quot; (&quot;to file a complaint&quot;) may be pronounced /ɾɛpɔ(ɾ)ˈtɐ/ or even /ɾɛpɔ(ɾ)ˈtʌ/ by some speakers rather than /ɾɛpɔ(ɾ)ˈta/. ⟨á⟩ however is generally pronounced as /a/, with the exception of the &quot;-(ç)ám&quot; suffix derived from Portuguese &quot;-(ç)ão&quot;.

In addition, initial unstressed vowels may be dropped entirely, for example Portuguese &quot;acabar&quot; and &quot;alugar&quot; becoming &quot;cavâ&quot; and &quot;lugâ&quot; respectively.

=====Diphthongs=====
Diphthongs from Portuguese are often not present or reduced in Macanese; for example, Portuguese &quot;cousa&quot; (archaic form of &quot;coisa&quot; (&quot;thing&quot;)) becomes Macanese &quot;cuza&quot; (&quot;what; why&quot;), Portuguese &quot;dous&quot; (&quot;two&quot;, modern term &quot;dois&quot;) becomes Macanese &quot;dôs&quot;, and Portuguese &quot;-eiro&quot; becomes &quot;-êro&quot; or &quot;-éro&quot; in Macanese. In some cases, this is due to Macanese inheriting a pre-Portuguese form; for example, &quot;nôm&quot; (&quot;not&quot;) derived from Old Galician-Portuguese &quot;non&quot; (compare Galician &quot;non&quot;), becoming a doublet of &quot;nâm&quot; which comes from Portuguese &quot;não&quot;. Otherwise, the diphthong reduction may take place internally in Macanese, or in earlier Indo-Portuguese. Such de-diphthongization may sometimes render Macanese words closer to Spanish words, such as the aforementioned &quot;dôs&quot; and &quot;-êro&quot; (cf. Spanish &quot;dos&quot;, &quot;-ero&quot;), and also &quot;rópa&quot; (&quot;clothes&quot;) from Portuguese &quot;roupa&quot; (cf. Spanish &quot;ropa&quot;). 

In certain cases, even diphthongs from Cantonese may be reduced; Cantonese 「豆腐」(Jyutping: ) may be rendered as &quot;tafú&quot; rather than &quot;taufú&quot;; and 「快艇」(Jyutping: ) may become &quot;fatiám&quot; rather than &quot;faitiám&quot;. Nonetheless, both forms are in common use.

====Pronunciation of R====

The pronunciation of ⟨r⟩ depends on the speaker; before a vowel or between vowels, it is almost always pronounced /ɾ/, although /ʁ/ may be found word-initially with some speakers. After a vowel word-finally or before a consonant, it is always dropped in verbs and reflected as such in writing (cf. &quot;lugâ&quot; above, although older texts from the 20th century may still retain the &quot;-r&quot; in writing), and depending on the speaker, it may be dropped when used in less common Portuguese words even with ⟨r⟩ retained in spelling, or simply pronounced /ɾ/ as previous. 

As mentioned earlier, words such as &quot;isquevê&quot; may lose &quot;-r-&quot; even after a consonant, although those tend to be older words since modern Macanese are usually fully capable of pronouncing /ɾ/ before or after a consonant. This phenomenon sometimes results in multiple forms of a word; for example, Portuguese &quot;obrigado&quot; (&quot;thank you&quot;) manifests in Macanese both as &quot;obigado&quot; (with R-dropping) and &quot;brigado&quot;, with ⟨r⟩ retained but with the initial unstressed vowel dropped instead. 

One phenomenon with older words is when /kɾi/ is reduced to /ki/, for example Portuguese criança&quot; (&quot;child&quot;) becoming quiança&quot;. Though there are exceptions to this even in older words, for example &quot;cristám&quot; (&quot;Catholic; Christian&quot;) rather than &quot;quistám&quot;.

R-dropping in Macanese parallels Hong Kong English, where ⟨r⟩ is generally also not pronounced after a vowel, and sometimes realized as /w/ word-initially and after a consonant.

===Grammar===
There has been little scientific research of Macanese grammar, much less on its development between the 16th and 20th centuries. Its grammatical structure seems to incorporate both European and Asian elements.

====Articles====
Like most Asian languages, Macanese lacks definite articles (but has an indefinite article ), and does not inflect verbs: for example, means &quot;I am,&quot; and means &quot;he/she is&quot;. The indefinite article is also used to create qualifiers, such as (&quot;which&quot;), (&quot;this&quot;), or (&quot;each&quot;).

====Pronouns====
Macanese also lacks pronoun cases (&quot;io&quot; or &quot;iou&quot; means &quot;I,&quot; &quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;), and forms possessive pronouns using the suffix &quot;-sua&quot; or &quot;-sa&quot;; for example, &quot;ilôtro-sua&quot; or &quot;ilôtro-sa&quot; means &quot;theirs&quot;, while &quot;iou-sua&quot; or &quot;io-sa&quot; means &quot;my&quot;. Certain possessive pronouns are however retained from Portuguese; &quot;minha&quot; is used as a synonym to &quot;iou-sa&quot; in emotional situations as well as in the header of letters, while &quot;nôsso&quot; and &quot;vôsso&quot; are also used in Macanese for the first-person plural possessive pronoun and the second-person singular possessive pronoun respectively, in addition to &quot;nôs-sa&quot; and &quot;vôs-sa&quot;. &quot;su&quot;, from Indo-Portuguese &quot;su&quot; and earlier Galician-Portuguese &quot;seu&quot;, is also used in Macanese as a third-person (and rarely, second-person) reflexive possessive pronoun, used standalone instead of as a particle attached to a pronoun. In both speech and literature, &quot;-sa&quot; is more common than &quot;-sua&quot;, and the &quot;Glossário do dialecto macaense&quot; (1988) has &quot;-sa&quot; as one of its entries, only mentioning &quot;-sua&quot; in its description.

In general, pronouns in Macanese are not gendered, that is, &quot;êle&quot; is used as the universal third-person singular pronoun. Macanese is also nominally pro-drop, even despite the lack of verb conjugations; the subject of a sentence must therefore be inferred through context. Both pronoun features (gender-neutral third-person singular pronoun, pro-drop) are likely influences from Cantonese, with the former being a calque of Cantonese 「&quot;佢&quot;」, which is gender-neutral unlike the Mandarin and Standard Chinese「&quot;他&quot;」, 「&quot;她&quot;」, etc..

====Grammatical gender====

While Macanese nominally uses a gender-neutral third-person pronoun, some speakers may use &quot;êla&quot; to indicate &quot;she&quot; or &quot;her&quot;, as opposed to using &quot;êle&quot; for all genders. This is likely due to influence from modern Portuguese.

In very rare cases, adjectives may also have feminine forms depending on the former gender of the noun in Portuguese. For example, bô-quiança&quot; (&quot;good child&quot;) rather than &quot;bôm-quiança&quot;, with &quot;bô&quot; possibly deriving from Portuguese &quot;boa&quot;, feminine form of &quot;bom&quot; (whence Macanese &quot;bôm&quot;); or maquiaçám&quot; (&quot;spoiling (e.g. a child)&quot;) from Portuguese &quot;má criação&quot;, rather than &quot;mauquiaçám&quot;, despite the existence of &quot;mau&quot; in Macanese.

====Tenses====
Progressive action (denoted in English by the &quot;-ing&quot; verbal forms) is denoted by a separate particle &quot;tâ&quot;, presumably derived from Portuguese &quot;está&quot; (&quot;it is&quot;). Completed actions are likewise indicated by the particle &quot;já&quot;, presumably from Portuguese &quot;já&quot; (&quot;right now&quot; or &quot;already&quot;), while &quot;nunca&quot; is used for things in the past which did not happen. &quot;lôgo&quot; (from Portuguese &quot;logo&quot; (&quot;soon&quot;)) may be used for the positive future tense, while &quot;nádi&quot; is used for the negative future tense. In some cases, two time particles can be used in the same clause, for example in the sentence &quot;&quot;Lôgo&quot; iou &quot;tâ&quot; vai chuchumecâ co vôs&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ll be gossiping with you&quot;), but this is relatively rare. But in general, grammatical tense may not be indicated at all, and would require a listener or reader to infer from either context or time words such as &quot;onte&quot; (&quot;yesterday&quot;) or &quot;amanhâm&quot; (&quot;tomorrow&quot;). 

Participles are generally formed by appending &quot;-do&quot; to the verb root, same as in Portuguese. However, participles in Macanese are relatively rare and often only serve as adjectives denoting the current state and change in state of something, for example &quot;estricâ rópa&quot; (&quot;to iron clothes&quot;) → &quot;rópa estricado (&quot;ironed clothes, clothes that have been ironed&quot;), or &quot;durmí&quot; (&quot;to sleep&quot;) → &quot;ficâ durmido (&quot;to fall asleep&quot;, lit. &quot;to become asleep&quot;). Otherwise, some participles, especially irregular ones, may be inherited directly from Portuguese, for example &quot;fêto&quot; (&quot;done&quot;) from Portuguese &quot;feito&quot; rather than forming &quot;*fazido&quot; from &quot;fazê&quot; (&quot;to do&quot;).

====Reduplication====
Reduplication is used to make plural nouns (&quot;casa-casa&quot; = &quot;houses&quot;), plural adjectives (&quot;china-china&quot; = &quot;several Chinese people or things&quot;), and emphatic adverbs (&quot;cedo-cedo&quot; = &quot;very early&quot;), a pattern also found in Malay grammar. Otherwise, some nouns may be pluralized with no reduplication, especially when the amount of the noun is not important to the main idea of the sentence, and the pluralization is instead implied through context. 

In older Macanese, it was more common for partial reduplication to take place, where only the first syllable of a multisyllabic word, or the first consonant (if any) + first vowel in a monosyllabic word, would be duplicated, for example &quot;fu-fula&quot; (&quot;flowers&quot;) from &quot;fula&quot; (&quot;flower&quot;). This has nearly disappeared in modern Macanese in favour of full reduplication, that is a duplication of the entire word, i.e. &quot;fula-fula&quot; for &quot;flowers&quot;. Among the most common Macanese words, only two still use partial reduplication: &quot;nhunhum&quot; (&quot;men&quot;) from &quot;nhum&quot; (&quot;man&quot;), and &quot;nhonhônha&quot; (&quot;women&quot;) from &quot;nhonha&quot; (&quot;woman&quot;). In other cases, partial reduplication has formed words with entirely different meanings to the original word, for example &quot;chuchupa&quot; (&quot;paper cone used to hold roasted peanuts or chestnuts&quot;) from &quot;chupa&quot;, a (traditionally cylindrical) cubic measure descended from Malay &quot;cupak&quot;.

====Prepositions====
Similarly to Chavacano, &quot;na&quot; is used to indicate &quot;in&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, or &quot;on&quot;; but unlike Chavacano, &quot;pa&quot; (from Portuguese &quot;para&quot;) is used to indicate &quot;to&quot; or &quot;towards&quot;.

&quot;di&quot; (literally &quot;of&quot;, from Portuguese &quot;de&quot;) can also be used to connect nouns with adjectives, for example &quot;casa qui di largo&quot; meaning &quot;large house&quot;, or combined with &quot;bêm&quot; (&quot;well&quot;) to mean &quot;very&quot;, for example &quot;bêm-di filiz&quot; meaning &quot;very happy&quot;.

====Comparatives and superlatives====
Superlative and comparative forms are usually simply created by using &quot;más&quot; (&quot;more; most&quot;) before the adjective or adverb, for example &quot;más bôm&quot; (lit. &quot;more good&quot;) and &quot;más bêm&quot; (lit. &quot;more well&quot;) meaning &quot;better&quot;. Some irregular comparative forms may be inherited from Portuguese, such as &quot;pió&quot; (&quot;worse&quot;) from Portuguese &quot;pior&quot;.

====Apocope and apheresis====
Common function words (time words, indefinite article, etc.) may sometimes have apocopic or aphetic forms. For example, &quot;abrí unga janela&quot; (&quot;open a window&quot;) may become &quot;abrí&#x27;nga janela&quot;, tudo ora&quot; (&quot;always&quot;, literally &quot;all time&quot;) may become tud&#x27;ora&quot;, or já uví?&quot; (&quot;did you hear?&quot;) may become j&#x27;uví?&quot;. This however depends on the speaker and is not standard or mandatory, unlike in French.

====Cantonese influences====
There are also some other less significant grammatical constructions derived from Cantonese, for example the usage of &quot;verb-not-verb&quot; for asking yes-no questions, e.g. &quot;(vôs) quêro-nôm-quêro&quot; meaning &quot;do you want&quot;.

===Writing system===
Patuá has no standardized orthography. A common orthography was first proposed by José dos Santos Ferreira, and the current most common orthography is largely based on Ferreira&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Papiaçám di Macau&quot;, itself based mostly on the Portuguese orthography.

In the de-facto standard orthography, the circumflex (&quot;â, ê, ô&quot;) or acute accent (&quot;á, é, í, ó, ú&quot;) are used to indicate syllable stress and open-vowel pronunciation, especially in the case of monosyllabic words. This contrasts with the Malay-based orthography of Kristang, which often uses &quot;-h&quot; after a vowel to indicate stress. The tilde is generally not used, except sometimes in the words &quot;sã&quot;, usually written as &quot;sâm&quot; or &quot;sam&quot;, or &quot;nã&quot;, written in modern Macanese as &quot;nâm&quot; or &quot;nam&quot;.

&quot;Maquista Chapado&quot; (2004) recommends using the circumflex for closed stressed &quot;a, e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;, the acute accent for (semi-)open stressed &quot;a, e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;, as well as stressed &quot;i, u&quot; in a word-final position, although this is not always followed in practice. For example, the word meaning &quot;bread&quot; (which descends from Portuguese &quot;pão&quot;) is recommended to be written as &quot;pám&quot;, however other sources (including but not limited to certain parts in &quot;Maquista Chapado&quot; itself) may instead use &quot;pâm&quot;.

The &quot;-ão&quot; suffix in Portuguese usually becomes &quot;-ám&quot; in Macanese if stressed, for example &quot;coraçám&quot; (&quot;heart&quot;) from Portuguese &quot;coração&quot;; or &quot;-a&quot; if unstressed, for example &quot;bênça&quot; from Portuguese &quot;bênção&quot;, although &quot;-âm&quot; is generally more common in monosyllabic words descended from &quot;-ão&quot;, as outlined with &quot;pâm&quot; earlier. &quot;-ám&quot; is also used to spell &quot;-ang&quot; from Malay/Indonesian or Cantonese, for example &quot;saiám (&quot;what a pity!; missing&quot;) from Malay &quot;sayang. &quot;-âm&quot; is sometimes also used in multisyllabic words if the Portuguese word ends in a non-diphthongal nasal vowel, for example &quot;amanhâm from Portuguese &quot;amanhã. 

In general, it is recommended both by Ferreira and &quot;Maquista Chapado&quot; to use &quot;-m&quot; for the word-final nasal consonant /-ŋ/, while &quot;-n&quot; may be used to denote a nasal consonant when following a vowel and preceding a consonant, for example /aŋˈkuza/ → &quot;ancusa&quot; rather than &quot;amcusa&quot; or &quot;angcusa&quot;. 

One exception is the indefinite article &quot;unga&quot;, pronounced /ˈuŋa/, same as the Galician &quot;unha&quot;. Some Macanese sources may spell it instead as &quot;ung&#x27;a&quot;, to prevent the word from being pronounced as /ˈuŋɡa/ (which some speakers do anyway). This also applies to its derived terms, such as &quot;estunga&quot; (&quot;this&quot;) or &quot;cadunga&quot; (&quot;each&quot;). Multi-word Cantonese loanwords may also retain &quot;ng&quot;, but monosyllabic Cantonese words generally still use &quot;-m&quot;, for example &quot;sôm (&quot;food; a dish&quot;) from Cantonese 「&quot;餸&quot;」 (Jyutping: &quot;sung3&quot;), or &quot;tôm-tôm (&quot;a piece of candy&quot;) from reduplication of Cantonese 「糖」 (&quot;sugar; candy&quot;, Jyutping: &quot;tong4-2&quot;).

When /e/ is reduced or otherwise morphed into /i/ or /ɪ/, it is often spelt phonetically with ⟨i⟩, for example &quot;fichâ&quot; and &quot;qui compared to Portuguese &quot;fechar&quot; and &quot;que. Likewise, when /o/ becomes /u/ in Macanese, or when Macanese inherits a dialectal Portuguese form which uses /u/ instead of /o/, it is also directly spelt as ⟨u⟩, such as &quot;durmí&quot; (&quot;to sleep&quot;) from Portuguese &quot;dormir&quot;. Etymological ⟨s⟩ pronounced as /z/ may be written either as ⟨s⟩ or ⟨z⟩, for example &quot;cuza&quot; (&quot;what, which&quot;) and &quot;ancusa&quot; (&quot;thing&quot;) both derive from dated Portuguese &quot;cousa&quot;, but are spelt differently. /s/ between vowels is often written as &quot;ss&quot; like in Swiss German, for example in the word &quot;bassâ&quot; /baˈsa/ (&quot;to lower&quot;). 

Portuguese /ʒ/, pronounced variously as /z/ or /d͡ʒ/, may be written as either ⟨g⟩, ⟨j⟩ or ⟨z⟩, the former two deriving from Portuguese orthography, for example Portuguese &quot;fingir&quot; may become &quot;fingí&quot; or &quot;finzí&quot;. This sometimes leads to inconsistencies between the most common spelling and actual pronunciation, for example &quot;hoze&quot; (&quot;today&quot;, from Portuguese &quot;hoje&quot;) may be pronounced /ˈɔd͡ʒi/ by some speakers.

Otherwise, the de-facto standard orthography tends to follow Portuguese orthographic rules, for example silent ⟨h⟩ in Portuguese words, &quot;-n&quot; or &quot;-m&quot; after a vowel to indicate nasalization (although &quot;-n&quot; may simply be /n/, especially in Cantonese loanwords), ⟨i⟩ before/after a vowel to represent /j/, or using ⟨c⟩ for /k/ before ⟨a⟩, ⟨o⟩, and ⟨u⟩ (compare Macanese &quot;cacús&quot; with Indonesian &quot;kakus&quot;), and ⟨ç⟩ for non-word-initial /s/ before those vowels, even in foreign words. Words borrowed from Cantonese may use an orthography similar to the Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanisation, for example &quot;leong-fan&quot; (&quot;grass jelly&quot;) borrowed from Cantonese &quot;涼粉&quot;.

===Modern Macanese===
Modern Macanese differs rather greatly from Macanese spoken during and before the first half of the 20th Century. The modern variety can be said to have taken its shape after the 1950s, with Macanese literature of the time still more or less recognizable today. In addition to strong influences from Cantonese, Portuguese has re-asserted its influence to a degree, both in vocabulary and in phonology.

Older words borrowed from Malay or South Asian sources may be supplanted by Portuguese words. For example, (&quot;sun&quot;) from Marathi () appears to have become all but archaic even in the later half of the 20th century, replaced by the Portuguese . Other such words may take on extended meanings, such as , from Malay + (lit. &quot;one coin thread&quot;), which formerly only meant &quot;coin&quot;, but is now the most common word meaning &quot;money&quot;.

In other cases, Macanese has undergone a certain degree of decreolization, with Portuguese-derived words losing their extended meanings; for example , from Portuguese (&quot;now&quot;), formerly also had the senses of &quot;at the same time&quot; and &quot;since&quot;, however modern Macanese almost exclusively uses the word simply to mean &quot;now&quot;. In other cases of decreolization, a word derived from a Portuguese regional variant may be discarded in favour of the modern standard Portuguese word, such as replacing older , meaning &quot;window&quot;.

Increasingly, ⟨m⟩ before a consonant is also simply pronounced /m/ rather than as /ŋ/, despite ⟨m⟩ being a nasalizing consonant in Portuguese. For example, (&quot;to stand up&quot;), from Portuguese /ɐ̃j̃ ˈpɛ/, is more likely to be pronounced /emˈpɛ/ or /imˈpɛ/ rather than /eŋˈpɛ/ or /iŋˈpɛ/. ⟨n⟩ before a consonant however generally remains nasalized as /ŋ/, with the exception of most Cantonese loanwords. It has also been found that in the consonant clusters ⟨nd⟩, ⟨nj⟩, ⟨nt⟩, and ⟨nz⟩ where ⟨z⟩ is pronounced [d͡ʒ], the pronunciation of ⟨n⟩ also becomes [n], for example (&quot;where&quot;) being pronounced /ˈun.di/ rather than /ˈuŋ.di/. Older dictionaries, such as the &quot;Glossário Do Dialecto Macaense&quot; (1988), generally record pre-consonant ⟨m⟩ with nasalization, such as notating &quot;ambá&quot; as [ą̃bą́] rather than say [ąmbą́], despite &quot;ambá&quot; (modern &quot;ambâ&quot; or ) deriving from English &quot;humbug&quot; where /m/ is not nasalized.

In addition to lexical contributions, Cantonese has also significantly influenced the grammar of modern Macanese; one example is the common usage of (lit. &quot;to go&quot;) before verbs, which parallels the Cantonese usage of , which in addition to &quot;to go&quot; can also mean &quot;to go in order to do something&quot;.

Younger Macanese (under the age of 60), who may be less fluent in Macanese and more fluent in Cantonese, may even write full sentences using outright Cantonese syntax. For example, the sentence (&quot;He says that tomorrow he will go to Hotel Lisboa to gamble&quot;) may be translated word for word into/from Cantonese as , with the exact same syntax. In addition, de-diphthongized words may sometimes be re-diphthongized in alignment with the Portuguese origin word, for example saying (&quot;law&quot;) rather than the expected de-diphthongized form ; compare this with the word (&quot;king&quot;), from Portuguese .

== Examples ==
Here is an example of a Patuá poem:

Note that is cognate with in Malay/Kristang, both being derived from Portuguese . In addition, due to the lack of a standardized orthography, various words may be spelled differently from person to person, such as being written as .

<text>Mary Abigail Wambach, OLY (born June 2, 1980) is an American retired soccer player, coach, and member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. A six-time winner of the U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year award, Wambach was a regular on the U.S. women&#x27;s national soccer team from 2003 to 2015, earning her first cap in 2001. As a forward, she currently stands as the highest all-time goal scorer for the national team and is second in international goals for both female and male soccer players with 184 goals, behind Canadian Christine Sinclair. Wambach was awarded the 2012 FIFA World Player of the Year, becoming the first American woman to win the award in 10 years. She was included on the 2015 &quot;Time&quot; 100 list as one of the most influential people in the world.

Wambach competed in four FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup tournaments: 2003 in the United States, 2007 in China, 2011 in Germany, and 2015 in Canada, being champion of the last edition; and two Olympics tournaments: 2004 in Athens and 2012 in London, winning the gold medal in both. All together, she played in 29 matches and scored 22 goals at these five international tournaments. She played college soccer for the Florida Gators women&#x27;s soccer team and helped the team win its first NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Soccer Championship. She played at the professional level for Washington Freedom, magicJack, and the Western New York Flash.

Known for scoring goals with diving headers, a technique she began honing as a youth in her hometown of Rochester, New York, one of her most notable header goals occurred in the 122nd minute of the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup quarterfinal match against Brazil. Wambach scored the equalizer in stoppage time helping the Americans to eventually progress to the championship final against Japan after defeating Brazil in penalty kicks. Her last-minute goal set a new record for latest goal ever scored in a match and was awarded ESPN&#x27;s 2011 ESPY Award for Best Play of the Year. Following her performance at the 2011 World Cup, she was awarded the tournament&#x27;s Bronze Boot and Silver Ball. In 2011, she became the first ever soccer player of either sex to be named Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press.

Wambach announced her retirement on October 27, 2015. Her last game was played on December 16 in New Orleans when the United States played its last match of its 10-game Victory Tour following its win at the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. Her autobiography, &quot;Forward&quot;, released in September 2016, became a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller. Her second book, &quot;Wolfpack: How to Come Together, Unleash Our Power and Change the Game&quot;, based on her viral commencement speech at Barnard College, was also a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller in 2019.

==Early life==
Born in Rochester, New York, Wambach was raised in the Rochester suburb of Pittsford. She is the youngest of seven siblings (with two sisters and four brothers) born to Pete and Judy Wambach. She began playing soccer at the age of four after her sister decided she wanted to try the sport. Their mother checked out a book from the library explaining how to play the game, and from then on soccer became part of their family tradition. &quot;I think I was bred to do what I do now,&quot; Wambach said in an interview. &quot;Growing up as the youngest of seven was like being in a team environment, you learn all kinds of things ... I learned how to compete, my brothers and sisters always played with me on the same level and they never let me win until I was better than them and deserved it. Being in such a big family makes you humble. You might have a certain skill or talent but there is always someone who is better at something than you.&quot;
Wambach recalls being toughened up by her elder brothers firing hockey pucks at her for target practice. While playing in her first youth soccer league at age five, she was transferred from the girls&#x27; team to the boys&#x27; after scoring 27 goals in only three games. As a pre-teen, she began eluding defenders by heading the ball over them and running around them.

Wambach attended Our Lady of Mercy High School in Rochester from 1994 to 1998, where she lettered in soccer and basketball. During her high school career, she scored 142 goals, including 34 in 1997 alone. Mercy&#x27;s soccer coach, Kathy Boughton, recalled that Wambach often stayed after practice to practice diving headers – a skill that later became her signature as an international player. Following her senior season, Wambach was named to &quot;Parade&quot; magazine&#x27;s High School All-America Team. She was also voted national high school player of the year by Umbro and the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA). In 1997, she was named NSCAA Regional Player of the Year, NSCAA State of New York Player of the Year, Gatorade Circle of Champions New York Player of the Year, and cited by &quot;USA Today&quot; as one of the nation&#x27;s top 10 recruits.

Wambach was a three-year captain for the Rochester Spirit club team and named All-Greater Rochester Player of the Year in 1995 and 1997. She was a member of the Olympic Development Program (ODP) U-16 National Team in 1996, the 1997 National U-20 Player Pool, and trained and played with the U.S. women&#x27;s national soccer team while competing in the 1997 U.S. Soccer Festival in Blaine, Minnesota. In 1997, she traveled to Beijing, China, as a member of the first American youth soccer team to ever compete there.

==University of Florida Gators, 1998–2001==
Considered the top college recruit in 1997, Wambach was intensely sought after by numerous colleges, including top soccer programs such as the University of North Carolina, UCLA, the University of Portland, and the University of Virginia. After sticking with her commitment to her parents to visit five schools, Wambach accepted a full athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, where she played for coach Becky Burleigh&#x27;s Florida Gators women&#x27;s soccer team from 1998 to 2001. Florida&#x27;s program had only been in existence for three years; however, the challenge of joining a less established team over a team like North Carolina with a long history of championship titles appealed to Wambach. As a freshman in 1998, Wambach helped lead the Gators to their first NCAA national championship over the 15-time champion North Carolina Tar Heels. The team also won four consecutive Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships from 1998 to 2001.

Individually, she was the SEC Freshman of the Year (1998), a freshman All-American (1998), a first-team All-SEC selection for four straight seasons (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001), a two-time SEC Player of the Year (2000, 2001), twice received SEC Tournament Most Valuable Player honors (2000, 2001), and was named a first-team All-American her sophomore, junior, and senior seasons in 1999, 2000 and 2001. In addition to leading the Gators to the Final Four of the NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Soccer Tournament as a senior in 2001, Wambach set school career records for goals (96), assists (50), points (242), game-winning goals (24), and hat tricks (10). Over ten years later, she remains the Florida Gators&#x27; all-time leading scorer with ninety-six goals. Wambach was inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great&quot; in 2012.

==Club career==
===Washington Freedom: the WUSA years, 2002–03===
In 2002, Wambach was selected second during the first round of the 2002 WUSA draft by the Washington Freedom for the second season of the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA). After tying with the Carolina Courage for last place during the previous season, the Freedom hoped to turn things around in 2002. With Mia Hamm out for the first half of the season for knee surgery and recovery, the Freedom found themselves in sixth place. After Hamm&#x27;s return, the team finished the remainder of the season 9–1–2, finishing third with a berth into the playoffs. Of the team&#x27;s turnaround, Wambach noted, &quot;Early on in the season it was difficult to get everyone on the same page. Mia was out, we had just started playing with the Chinese players, Steffi hadn&#x27;t come yet. There were so many factors that went into us not playing as well. Since people have returned, and we have been able to grasp what exactly one another was doing out there, it&#x27;s been easier to get results.&quot; During the semi-finals, the Freedom upset the Philadelphia Charge 1–0. During the final against the Carolina Courage, the Freedom lost in front of 12,000 spectators at Herndon Stadium in Atlanta. Wambach assisted on Hamm&#x27;s 64th-minute goal, the team&#x27;s second goal, after the Courage&#x27;s Danielle Fotopoulos scored an own goal in the 31st minute; however, it was not enough to equalize Carolina&#x27;s three goals. After leading all first-year players in the league in scoring, Wambach was named WUSA Rookie of the Year in 2002. She was Washington&#x27;s leading scorer with ten goals and ten assists and finished tied for fourth for scoring in the WUSA. She scored twice in the inaugural 2002 WUSA All-Star Game, being named game MVP.

During the 2003 season, Wambach tied with Freedom teammate, Mia Hamm for the league&#x27;s scoring lead with 33 points. Her contributions in Washington helped to propel the Freedom to a victory in the Founders Cup III, where Wambach was named the MVP. During the seventh minute of regulation time, she scored the second-fastest goal in Founders Cup history after she headed the ball into the lower left side of the net past Beat goalkeeper and national team teammate, Brianna Scurry. She scored the game-winning goal in the sixth minute of overtime off a cross from Jennifer Meier, leading the Freedom to defeat the Atlanta Beat 2–1 during the championship match.

Five days before the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the first World Cup that Wambach would play in, the WUSA folded citing financial difficulties and a lack of sponsorship. In summer 2005 she played for Women&#x27;s Premier Soccer League (WPSL) club Ajax America Women, alongside USWNT teammate Shannon Boxx. She scored five goals and served three assists in three appearances.

===WPS: Wambach&#x27;s return to Washington and Florida, 2009–11===

In 2008, a new professional league was announced for women in the United States: Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer (WPS). During the 2008 WPS Player Allocation in which twenty-one players from the United States national team player pool were assigned to the seven teams in the new league, Wambach was assigned to the Washington Freedom. After league play began in March 2009, she was voted WPS Player of the Week for the week of April 26 (Week 5) after scoring two goals in the Washington Freedom&#x27;s 4–3 victory over the FC Gold Pride, the Freedom&#x27;s first victory in the new league. During the Freedom&#x27;s next game on May 3, 2009, she received a yellow card for a tackle on St. Louis Athletica midfielder Daniela that left Daniela with two damaged knee ligaments and a crack in the tibia and sidelined her for the rest of the season. Wambach was suspended for one game after the challenge was reviewed by the league commissioner.

Wambach won the WPS Player of the Week award for the week of July 28 (Week 18) for scoring two goals against the Chicago Red Stars and Sky Blue FC and for the week of Aug 11 (Week 20) for scoring two goals and having one assist against Sky Blue. She ended the 2009 season with eight goals more than any other American player in the WPS and was named to the 2010 WPS All-Star Team.

Wambach returned to the Washington Freedom for the 2010 WPS season, winning the WPS Player of the Week award in week 2 for scoring one goal and serving two assists against the Atlanta Beat. She was the top overall vote-getter in WPS All-Star voting, making her one of two captains for the 2010 WPS All-Star Game. Wambach received 100% of the media&#x27;s and coaches&#x27; votes and received the most fans&#x27; votes-with 31%.

In 2011, the Freedom relocated to Boca Raton, Florida and became the magicJack under new ownership. On July 22, 2011, Wambach was named the player-coach for the magicJack for the rest of the 2011 WPS season. She was named WPS Player of the Week for the seventh time in August 2011.

On October 26, 2011, the Women&#x27;s Professional Soccer League Governors voted to terminate the magicJack franchise. The league suspended operations in early 2012.

===NWSL: Leading the Flash in Rochester, 2013–14===

In 2012, a new professional women&#x27;s soccer league was announced in the U.S. that featured allocated players from the American, Mexican, and Canadian national teams. On January 11, 2013, Wambach was allocated to the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League club, Western New York Flash, in her hometown of Rochester, New York, as part of the NWSL Player Allocation. After missing the preseason because of national team commitments, she made her debut on April 14, 2013, during the team&#x27;s season opener against Sky Blue FC.

During the team&#x27;s second regular season match against the Washington Spirit in Boyds, Maryland, Wambach was struck hard in the face from close range on an attempted clearance by her teammate, Brittany Taylor, in the 80th minute of the match. She dropped to the ground and appeared disoriented after standing up. Though she continued playing to finish the match and even attempted to score a goal with her head, she dropped to the ground after the final whistle and was described by Spirit goalkeeper, Ashlyn Harris as dazed and mumbling. Wambach was assessed after the game for concussion. US Soccer announced several days later that she had suffered a concussion and acknowledged that the injury should have been handled differently by the referee, coaching staff, and players. Wambach sat out the next game as a precautionary health measure. She made her home debut for the Flash on May 1 and scored the match-winning goal in the 20th minute to defeat Sky Blue 2–1. It was the team&#x27;s first league win and lifted them to a three-way tie for third place in the league.

Wambach was named Week 5 NWSL Player of the Week after scoring both goals in the Flash&#x27;s 2–1 victory over FC Kansas City. She became the first player in the league to win the award twice after scoring a goal and serving an assist during the Flash&#x27;s 3–0 win over Sky Blue FC during Week 9.

Wambach announced on March 18, 2015, that she was sitting out the entire 2015 NWSL season in order to focus on the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. Two weeks later, on March 30, 2015, Wambach&#x27;s playing rights were traded along with midfielder Amber Brooks and a first-round pick in the 2016 NWSL college draft to Seattle Reign FC in exchange for forwards Sydney Leroux and Amanda Frisbie.

==International career==
In 2001, Wambach&#x27;s WUSA and collegiate performance earned her a spot at the national team training camp. Her first camp for the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team occurred on September 9, 2001, during a match against Germany at the Nike U.S. Cup in Chicago. She subbed in for Tiffeny Milbrett in the 76th minute. The U.S. won 4–1. She scored her first international goal on April 27, 2002, during a friendly match against Finland in San Jose, California after subbing in for Christie Welsh in the 75th minute. The U.S. won 3–0.

===2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup===

In August 2003, Wambach was named to the U.S. roster by Coach April Heinrichs for her first World Cup tournament. Having played in just six international matches, with three starts, before the 2003 World Cup, Wambach led the United States in scoring with three goals at the tournament.

Before a stadium filled with over 34,144 spectators at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C., Wambach made the starting line-up in the Americans&#x27; first match of the tournament against Sweden on September 21, 2003. The U.S. defeated Sweden 3–1 with goals scored by Kristine Lilly, Cindy Parlow, and Shannon Boxx. During the squad&#x27;s second tournament match against Nigeria in Philadelphia in front of 31,553 spectators, Wambach scored in the 65th minute to bring the U.S. lead to 4–0. The U.S. would ultimately defeat Nigeria 5–0. She scored her third tournament goal during the squad&#x27;s third Group stage match against North Korea on a penalty kick in the 17th minute. The U.S. defeated North Korea 3–0 after two additional goals from Cat Whitehill in the 48th and 66th minutes launching the team to the knock-out stage.

Wambach scored the only goal against Norway during the quarterfinal, paving the way for the Americans to the semi-finals. The Americans lost to Germany 3–0 in the semi-finals and were relegated to third place after their 3–1 win over Canada in the finals in front of 25,253 people at the Home Depot Center in Carson, California.

===2004 Summer Olympics===
After the WUSA suspended operations in 2003, Wambach trained with the national team in preparation for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. During the U.S.&#x27;s first two matches in Athens, she played a direct role in four of the five goals that the team scored resulting in wins over Greece and Brazil. During the team&#x27;s first group stage match against Greece on August 11, 2004, Wambach scored during the 30th minute to elevate the Americans to a 2–0 lead. She received her first yellow card of the tournament in the 49th minute. Mia Hamm followed with a goal in the 82nd minute for a final score of 3–0.

The U.S. faced Brazil during their second match of the tournament on August 14. Wambach received her second yellow card of the tournament in the 49th minute, giving her an automatic suspension for the final group stage match against Australia. After Hamm scored on a penalty kick in the 58th minute, Wambach sealed the win with a goal in the 77th. After moving on to the quarterfinals after a 1–1 tie against Australia in the final group stage match, the Americans faced Japan on August 20. Wambach&#x27;s goal in the 59th minute lifted the Americans to a 2–1 victory.

After defeating Germany in overtime during the semi-final, the U.S. faced Brazil for a second time in the Olympic final. Wambach&#x27;s 10-yard header in the 112th minute off a corner kick from Kristine Lilly gave the U.S. a 2–1 victory and the gold medal win. Her last-minute goal was hailed as one of the five biggest goals in U.S. women&#x27;s national team history by ESPN in 2011. Wambach finished the tournament with four goals and one assist. Her four goals set a new record for goals scored by a single U.S. player at an Olympic Tournament. The Olympic win also marked the start of significant changes for the national team as it was the final competitive international match for veteran players Mia Hamm, Joy Fawcett and Julie Foudy, who had played with the team since the first Women&#x27;s World Cup in 1991. On the significance of the win, Wambach said, &quot;It&#x27;s the least we can do for the women who have meant so much to us.&quot; At the end of 2004, Wambach had scored 31 goals and 13 assists in 30 matches for the national team. She finished fourth in voting for the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Player of the Year.

After the Athens Olympics, Wambach continued as a major contributor to the national team, scoring goals during the 2005 Algarve Cup and a number of exhibition games. During group play at the Algarve Cup, one of her goals helped the U.S. set a record for the largest goal margin in an Algarve Cup match after their 5–0 win over Denmark. At the end of 2006, Wambach had scored 66 goals in 84 international matches, scoring more goals in fewer games than any player since Michelle Akers. She was one of twenty players nominated for the 2006 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Player of the Year and finished fourth in voting for the award.

===2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup===
Heading into the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the national team had not conceded a game in regulation time in nearly three years and was considered a favorite to win the tournament in China. Wambach had become a regular on the team for five years and had assumed a new position as leader on the team. During their first match of the tournament against North Korea, Wambach collided in the air with North Korean defender, Ri Kum-Suk, and landed on the ground with blood streaming down her head. She was sidelined from the pitch for ten minutes while she received five stitches to the back of her head. Coach Greg Ryan decided not to replace Wambach, who had scored 78 goals in 97 games. The United States was ahead 1–0 thanks to a goal Wambach had scored in the 50th minute, assisted by Kristine Lilly. The squad allowed two goals while Wambach was away for those ten minutes. &quot;When they scored right away as I went off I started to get worried. So I started to run to the locker room to get stitches put in&quot;, Wambach said. A few minutes after Wambach returned to the pitch, the United States tied the match with a goal scored by Heather O&#x27;Reilly.

The team faced Sweden in their next match on September 14, 2007. Wambach scored two goals and notched up her record to 80 goals in 98 international matches after scoring in the 34th minute on a penalty kick and again in the 58th minute on a left-footed half-volley from a cross from Kristine Lilly. The U.S. finished group play with their 1–0 defeat over Nigeria on September 18. Wambach provided the assist with a header off a long thrown-in to Lori Chalupny who settled it off her chest and chipped the ball past Nigeria&#x27;s goalkeeper. The win launched the U.S. to the quarterfinals.

During the quarterfinal match against England on September 22, 2007, Wambach scored the first goal for the Americans during the 48th minute, followed by two goals scored by teammates Shannon Boxx and Kristine Lilly, defeating England 3–0. All three goals were scored within 12 minutes. During the first half, with the match poised at 0–0, English captain Faye White required extensive treatment following an elbow in the face from Wambach. Although Wambach insisted the contact was accidental, the English players and media thought otherwise. Wambach became the twentieth player in U.S. women&#x27;s national soccer team history (thirtieth American soccer player overall) to earn 100 international caps.

The United States faced Brazil in the semi-finals in what would become a controversial and game-changing match for the team. Coach Greg Ryan decided to bench starting goalkeeper, Hope Solo, and instead started Brianna Scurry, a veteran goalkeeper who had started in three World Cups and two Olympics, but who had started very few matches since the 2004 Olympics. The U.S. was defeated 4–0 by Brazil. The loss relegated them to a final match against Norway, which they won 4–1, to secure third place standing at the tournament. Wambach scored a brace with goals in the 30th and 46th minutes. She ended the tournament having scored six goals in six matches, despite her head injury and a previous foot injury suffered during a friendly match against Finland just a month prior to the World Cup.

===2008 Summer Olympics===

On June 23, 2008, Wambach was named to the U.S. squad for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. On July 16, during a nationally televised exhibition match against Brazil, she broke her left leg during a collision with Brazilian defender, Andréia Rosa, preventing her from playing at the Games.

Thirty-one minutes into the match in San Diego, California, Wambach ran at full speed seemingly to take a shot from about 30 yards and fiercely collided with Rosa. Wambach fell to the ground and immediately signaled for assistance. Her left leg was put in a brace and she was taken off the field on a stretcher. After being taken to a local hospital in an ambulance for X-rays, fractures to her tibia and fibula were confirmed. Wambach later underwent surgery to have a titanium rod inserted and was expected to be out of action for three months. The first match for the national team was slated to start on August 6. Wambach was the team&#x27;s leading scorer at the time and had just reached 99 goals in 127 matches, just one shy of becoming the fifth U.S. player and ninth female player in world history to notch 100 career international goals.

&quot;Obviously, it&#x27;s devastating, but above everything else, I&#x27;m only one player, and you can never win a championship with just one player&quot;, Wambach said of her injury, &quot;I have the utmost confidence in this team bringing home the gold.&quot; Although the team won the exhibition match with a goal scored by Natasha Kai off a free kick from Carli Lloyd and would enter the Games undefeated for the year, Wambach&#x27;s teammates were unsettled by her injury. &quot;My heart sank&quot;, Kai said, &quot;We need her. She&#x27;s a big piece of a great team.&quot;

Forward Lauren Cheney was called in to replace Wambach at the Games. &quot;There are obviously tons of emotions going through me right now&quot;, Cheney said, &quot;I have the deepest sorrow for Abby, but I am excited to be part of the 18 going to the Olympics.&quot; Wambach said during a conference call a few days after the injury, &quot;I called Lauren Cheney from the hospital, &#x27;I want you to go there and not feel bad about being selected in this type of way ... What&#x27;s important is that the team going into this tournament is feeling that they can win this. At the end of the day, that&#x27;s what makes you stand at the top podium.&quot;

Despite Wambach&#x27;s absence, the U.S. took home gold after defeating Brazil 1–0 in the final. Midfielder Carli Lloyd scored the game-winning goal in the 96th minute off an assist from forward, Amy Rodriguez, in front of 51,162 spectators at Workers Stadium. The gold medal was the third for the national team, after winning titles at the 2004 Athens Olympics and 1996 Atlanta Games, the first Olympic tournament that included women&#x27;s soccer.

Wambach scored her 100th goal during a friendly match against Canada in her hometown of Rochester on July 19, 2009, her second international match after returning from her injury. Of the goal, she said, &quot;After this year I&#x27;ve had, the heartbreak of not going to the Olympics, all of that pain is worth it. There&#x27;s nothing more you can ask for than play in front of your home crowd and come through with a milestone like I did today.&quot; She reached 100 goals in fewer games than any of the four other American players who had previously reached 100 goals: Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, Michelle Akers and Tiffeny Milbrett.

===2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup===

On May 9, 2011, the U.S. roster for the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup tournament in Germany was announced, including Wambach. The 2011 Women&#x27;s World Cup was the third World Cup tournament in which she played. After playing without scoring a goal in the first two group stage matches against North Korea and Colombia, Wambach scored in the 67th minute during the team&#x27;s final group stage match – a 2–1 loss to Sweden. With the loss, the U.S. finished second in their group and went on to face the first place team from Group D Brazil in the quarterfinal.

On July 10, 2011, during the Americans&#x27; quarter-final game against Brazil, Wambach scored a header goal in stoppage time after the 120th minute (120th+two minutes of injury time) to even the score at 2–2 against the Brazilians. The U.S. went on to win the game on penalty kicks and advanced to the semi-final. Wambach&#x27;s goal set a new record for latest goal ever scored in a FIFA competition. Her last-minute goal was awarded ESPN&#x27;s 2011 ESPY Award for Best Play of the Year. Wambach scored her third tournament goal during the Americans&#x27; 3–1 semi-final win over France.

During the final against underdogs Japan, Wambach&#x27;s trademark header goal during the first half of extra-time (her fourth in the tournament), made her the United States&#x27; all-time scoring leader in FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup history with 13 goals, second to Brazil&#x27;s Marta and Germany&#x27;s Birgit Prinz (14 all-time goals each). The U.S. was forced to a penalty shootout after a late equalizer by Japan. Japan won 3–1, with Wambach converting the fourth and only successful penalty for the U.S.

Wambach&#x27;s final tally for the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was four goals and one assist, an effort that earned her the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Bronze Boot after Brazil&#x27;s Marta (4 goals, 2 assists, Silver Boot) and Japan&#x27;s Homare Sawa (5 goals, 1 assist, Golden Boot). All 4 of Wambach&#x27;s goals in the tournament were scored using her head. For her efforts, Wambach was awarded the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Silver Ball to go alongside her silver medal and Bronze Boot.

===2012 Summer Olympics===
Wambach scored the first goal for the U.S. at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London during the team&#x27;s first group stage match against France on July 25, 2012. Down 2–0 after 14 minutes into the first half, Wambach headed the ball into the back of the net off a corner kick from Megan Rapinoe in the 19th minute. By the 30-minute mark, the Americans had tied the game with another goal from Alex Morgan. With another goal from Alex Morgan and one from Carli Lloyd during the second half, the U.S. defeated France 4–2.

During the United States&#x27; second group round game against Colombia, Wambach was struck in the right eye by an opposing player, but went on to score the second goal in her team&#x27;s 3–0 victory. The goal was her sixth career Olympic goal, which broke the previous U.S. record held by Mia Hamm and Tiffeny Milbrett. It was also her 140th international goal inching closer to Hamm&#x27;s record at 158 for most international goals scored. In the 38th minute, Colombian midfielder Lady Andrade ran into Wambach&#x27;s path while the U.S. was pushing upfield and punched her in the face. Wambach fell to the ground in pain. The referees did not seem to see the play and made no call. Ending the match with a swollen black eye, Wambach described what happened, &quot;I&#x27;m running toward the goal to get position, and I got sucker-punched&quot;, she said. &quot;It&#x27;s clear. We have it on film, so it&#x27;s up to the Olympic committee and FIFA to decide what to do.&quot; After reviewing match footage, FIFA officials later imposed a two-match ban on the Colombian player.

During the United States&#x27; third group stage match against North Korea, Wambach scored the lone goal of the match during the 25th minute on a play that consisted of a long ball by Lauren Cheney to Alex Morgan. Morgan slid a pass between two defenders to Wambach who easily tapped in her third goal of the tournament. In front of 29,522 spectators at Old Trafford, the Americans finished first in their group with the win and it launched them to the quarter-final against New Zealand. The game also marked the first women&#x27;s soccer game at Old Trafford in 23 years. During the quarter-final match against New Zealand, Wambach scored her fourth goal of the tournament during the 27th minute of the match. After sliding onto the ball to score, she then led a celebration of cartwheels – a tribute to the United States gymnastics team. With a second goal scored by Sydney Leroux in the 87th minute, the Americans defeated New Zealand 2–0 and moved onto the semi-finals. Wambach also scored the game-tying third goal, on a penalty kick, in the United States&#x27; 4–3 controversial semi-final win over Canada.

Wambach scored five goals at the 2012 Olympics and scored in every match except the final. In recognition of her accomplishments, she was awarded the 2012 FIFA World Player of the Year, at the 2013 FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or gala in Zurich, on January 7, 2013.

===2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup===

Prior to playing her fourth World Cup, Wambach declared that the Canada 2015 tournament would be her last. Given that nominal captain Christie Rampone started every game at the bench, Wambach was her first on-field substitute wearing the armband. She was the starting captain in three games, against Australia and Nigeria in the group stage and Colombia in the round of 16. Carli Lloyd, who acted as captain in the other four games, delivered the armband to Wambach as she entered the final against Japan with eleven minutes remaining, and Wambach in turn passed it over to Rampone as she entered at the 86th minute. Rampone reciprocated by allowing Wambach to lift the World Cup trophy with her. During the victorious campaign, Wambach scored in a 1–0 win against Nigeria, her last goal in official competition.

==Career statistics==
===Club===
===International goals===
In her international career, Wambach scored 184 goals in 255 international matches. Up until January 29, 2020, Wambach was the highest all-time international goal scorer for men and women, until surpassed by Canadian National Team Captain Christine Sinclair. Wambach (27 goals) and Alex Morgan (28 goals) combined for 55 goals in 2012 – equaling a 21-year-old record set in 1991 by Michelle Akers (39 goals) and Carin Jennings (16 goals) as the most goals scored by any duo in U.S. women&#x27;s national team history.

===World Cup and Olympic appearances and goals===
Wambach competed in four FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup tournaments: 2003 in the United States, 2007 in China, 2011 in Germany and 2015 in Canada. She played in two Olympics tournaments: 2004 in Athens and 2012 in London. All together, she played in 30 matches and scored 22 goals at these five global tournaments. Along with her U.S. teammates, Wambach won two Olympic gold medals, finished third twice at the Women&#x27;s World Cup, finished second at the 2011 World Cup, and won the 2015 Women&#x27;s World Cup.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time, Wambach was known in particular for her goalscoring ability, and once was the most prolific player in international competitions in soccer history. Although she was not the quickest or most technically gifted forward, Wambach was known for her physical, effective, and direct style of play, as well as her excellent sense of space and positioning, which allowed her to get onto the end of long balls and crosses, as well as making passes to her teammates with back headers and backheels. Her height and physique allowed her to excel in the air, and she was renowned for her ability to score with her head, frequently producing goals from spectacular diving headers, and in rare occasions, from bicycle kicks. Although primarily a striker, Wambach was also known for her energy and outstanding work rate throughout her career, ranking all-time third in the national team&#x27;s number of assists behind Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly, often dropping into midfield to assist her teammates defensively and help start attacking plays; this enabled her to play anywhere along the front-line, and also to function as a playmaker in midfield on occasion, in her later career. In addition to her playing abilities, Wambach was praised for her determination, tenacity, and leadership.

==Honors and awards==

Wambach is a six-time winner of the U.S. Soccer Federation&#x27;s U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year award (2003, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2013). In 2002, she received the WUSA&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award for her performance during the 2001 WUSA season. During the three years that she played for the Washington Freedom and magicJack in the WPS, she was named WPS Player of the Week a record seven times.
In 2011, Wambach was awarded the Bronze Boot and Silver Ball at the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. She was also awarded the 2011 ESPY Award for Best Play for her 122nd-minute equalizing goal against Brazil during the quarterfinal. The same year, she was named the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation Sportswoman of the Year and received the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year, the first individual soccer player ever – man or woman – to receive the award. In July 2011, the mayor of Rochester, New York named July 20 &quot;Abby Wambach Day&quot; and she was given a key to the city. In August 2012, after returning home from winning gold at the Summer Olympics in London, the city of Rochester honored Wambach by hosting a dedication and ribbon-cutting ceremony in which the entrance to Sahlen&#x27;s Stadium was named &quot;Wambach Way&quot;.

Wambach was named the 2012 FIFA World Player of the Year, becoming the fourth woman ever, and the first American since Mia Hamm 10 years earlier, to win the award. Wambach received 20.67 percent of the votes from national team coaches and captains as well as select media over teammate Alex Morgan (13.5) and five-time winner Marta (10.87). During her acceptance speech, she thanked FIFA and President Blatter, her family, coaching and medical staff, and teammates and said, &quot;... winning any individual award is a total product of the team that you play for. I&#x27;ve never scored a goal without receiving a pass from somebody else. Thanks to all the fans out there who continue to inspire me and the rest of the team to win as many games as we can.&quot; Wambach was also a finalist for the award in 2011 and 2013.

Following the United States&#x27; win at the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, Wambach and her teammates became the first women&#x27;s sports team to be honored with a Ticker tape parade in New York City. Each player received a key to the city from Mayor Bill de Blasio. In October of the same year, the team was honored by President Barack Obama at the White House.

In 2015, Wambach was named to the Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. The following year, she received the 2016 ESPY Icon Award

For their first match of March 2019, the women of the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team each wore a jersey with the name of a woman they were honoring on the back; Alex Morgan chose the name of Wambach.

==Personal life==
Wambach is married to author Glennon Doyle. They reside in Hermosa Beach, California. She previously lived in Naples, Florida; Portland, Oregon; and Pittsford, New York.

Wambach was previously married to soccer player Sarah Huffman from 2013 to 2016. Following their wedding in Hawaii in October 2013, Wambach stated that her marriage was not a political statement and did not represent a coming out, because she had never been closeted: &quot;I can&#x27;t speak for other people, but for me, I feel like gone are the days that you need to come out of a closet. I never felt like I was in a closet. I never did. I always felt comfortable with who I am and the decisions I made.&quot; In September 2016, Wambach announced that she and Huffman were divorcing. Two months later, Wambach confirmed she was in a relationship with author and her future wife, Glennon Doyle. In February 2017, they announced their engagement. On May 14, 2017, the couple married.

Wambach was a supporter of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 primary election campaign and spoke at several campaign events. She was included in the 2022 Fast Company Queer 50 list.

Wambach and Doyle are a part of the ownership group of Angel City FC of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League.

===Controversy===
Beginning in December 2015, Wambach came out against men&#x27;s coach Jürgen Klinsmann and dual national players playing for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team. &quot;The way that he has brought in a bunch of these foreign guys is not something I believe in wholeheartedly. I don&#x27;t believe in it. I don&#x27;t believe in it in my heart.&quot; A couple of members of the men&#x27;s national team rebuked her for the criticism. Mix Diskerud, who was born in Norway to an American mother, was perhaps the most vocal in suggesting she &quot;think about who you try to disenfranchise.&quot; She reaffirmed her criticism during an interview released in October 2016, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s just my opinion, and I&#x27;m entitled to that. It feels a little bit odd to me that you have some guys that have never lived in the United States that play for the United States because they were able to secure a passport. To me, that just feels like they weren&#x27;t able to make it for their country and earn a living, so they&#x27;re coming here.&quot;

===Substance abuse and DUI arrest===
Wambach was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII) after being pulled over by Portland police on April 2, 2016, to which she pleaded guilty. Following the incident, automaker MINI pulled a commercial featuring Wambach. In her autobiography, which was released several months after the incident, Wambach wrote that she had abused prescription drugs and alcohol for many years and had been sober since her April arrest.

===Endorsements===
Wambach has signed endorsement deals with Gatorade, Nike, MVP Healthcare, and Panasonic. In 2010, she starred in a Dodge commercial with some of her national team teammates. She signed a one-year endorsement deal with Bank of America in July 2011. The same year, she appeared in commercials for magicJack phone service and ESPN SportsCenter. In 2012, she received a gold card from Chipotle Mexican Grill which entitles her to one free burrito daily for life. Although not a formal endorsement deal, Chipotle offers the cards to well-known professional athletes who publicly express a liking for the restaurant. In the summer of 2013, she signed an endorsement deal with the New York Apple Association and was featured in television, radio, print and online ads. In 2015, Wambach starred in a commercial for LED lighting company Cree.

===Philanthropy===
Wambach has done philanthropic work for the Epilepsy Foundation and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. She has participated in Mia Hamm&#x27;s annual Celebrity Soccer Challenge which raises money for Children&#x27;s Hospital Los Angeles and the Mia Hamm Foundation. In August 2011, Wambach joined teammates Alex Morgan and Hope Solo in a Bank of America charitable campaign at the Chicago Marathon. $5,000 was donated to the Juvenile Diabetes Association on her behalf. In 2013, she became an ambassador for Athlete Ally, a nonprofit organization that focuses on ending homophobia and transphobia in sports. She serves on the board of Together Rising, an all-women-led nonprofit organization founded by her wife, Glennon Doyle, supporting women, families, and children in crisis.

In 2013, Wambach&#x27;s biography was the focus of a one-hour ESPN documentary, &quot;Abby Head On&quot;. The same year, she appeared in the ESPN documentary series, &quot;Nine for IX&quot;. The &quot;Nine for IX&quot; documentary, &quot;The 99ers&quot;, in which Wambach appeared focused on the success and legacy of the national team that won the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

In April 2015, Wambach joined Alex Morgan on &quot;American Idol&quot; to announce that the show&#x27;s season winner would record the official song for Fox&#x27;s coverage of the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. In May of the same year, her likeness appeared on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; along with Alex Morgan and Christen Press. In December 2015, she starred in a commercial for Gatorade entitled &quot;Forget Me&quot;.

In July 2021, Wambach began hosting &quot;Abby&#x27;s Places&quot;, the first new series in the expansion of the Peyton&#x27;s Places franchise on ESPN+.

===Magazines===
Wambach posed nude in &quot;The Body Issue&quot; of &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot; in 2012. Of the experience, she said, &quot;Bodies come in all different shapes. Bodies come in all different sizes. My body is very different than most other females. ... I want to show people that no matter who you are, no matter what shape you are, that&#x27;s still beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in April 2015.

In September 2015, she was ranked by EA Sports as the No. 3 women&#x27;s player in the game. In February 2016, Mattel unveiled a Barbie doll in her likeness.

<doc id="591253" wikidata="Q187672" url="?curid=591253" title="Kirchhoff's circuit laws">
<text>Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws are two equalities that deal with the current and potential difference (commonly known as voltage) in the lumped element model of electrical circuits. They were first described in 1845 by German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff. This generalized the work of Georg Ohm and preceded the work of James Clerk Maxwell. Widely used in electrical engineering, they are also called Kirchhoff&#x27;s rules or simply Kirchhoff&#x27;s laws. These laws can be applied in time and frequency domains and form the basis for network analysis.

Both of Kirchhoff&#x27;s laws can be understood as corollaries of Maxwell&#x27;s equations in the low-frequency limit. They are accurate for DC circuits, and for AC circuits at frequencies where the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are very large compared to the circuits.

== Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law ==
This law, also called Kirchhoff&#x27;s first law, or Kirchhoff&#x27;s junction rule, states that, for any node (junction) in an electrical circuit, the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node; or equivalently:

&quot;The algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero.&quot;

Recalling that current is a signed (positive or negative) quantity reflecting direction towards or away from a node, this principle can be succinctly stated as: formula_1 where is the total number of branches with currents flowing towards or away from the node.

Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws were originally obtained from experimental results. However, the current law can be viewed as an extension of the conservation of charge, since charge is the product of current and the time the current has been flowing. If the net charge in a region is constant, the current law will hold on the boundaries of the region. This means that the current law relies on the fact that the net charge in the wires and components is constant.

=== Uses ===
A matrix version of Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law is the basis of most circuit simulation software, such as SPICE. The current law is used with Ohm&#x27;s law to perform nodal analysis.

The current law is applicable to any lumped network irrespective of the nature of the network; whether unilateral or bilateral, active or passive, linear or non-linear.

== Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law ==
This law, also called Kirchhoff&#x27;s second law, or Kirchhoff&#x27;s loop rule, states the following:

&quot;The directed sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop is zero.&quot;

Similarly to Kirchhoff&#x27;s current law, the voltage law can be stated as: formula_2

Here, is the total number of voltages measured.

{\partial t} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; in the exterior region. If each of the components has a finite volume, then the exterior region is simply connected, and thus the electric field is conservative in that region. Therefore, for any loop in the circuit, we find that formula_3 where formula_4 are paths around the &quot;exterior&quot; of each of the components, from one terminal to another. 

Note that this derivation uses the following definition for the voltage rise from formula_5 to formula_6:
formula_7

However, the electric potential (and thus voltage) can be defined in other ways, such as via the Helmholtz decomposition.

===Generalization===
In the low-frequency limit, the voltage drop around any loop is zero. This includes imaginary loops arranged arbitrarily in space – not limited to the loops delineated by the circuit elements and conductors. In the low-frequency limit, this is a corollary of Faraday&#x27;s law of induction (which is one of Maxwell&#x27;s equations).

This has practical application in situations involving &quot;static electricity&quot;.

== Limitations ==
Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws are the result of the lumped-element model and both depend on the model being applicable to the circuit in question. When the model is not applicable, the laws do not apply.

The current law is dependent on the assumption that the net charge in any wire, junction or lumped component is constant. Whenever the electric field between parts of the circuit is non-negligible, such as when two wires are capacitively coupled, this may not be the case. This occurs in high-frequency AC circuits, where the lumped element model is no longer applicable. For example, in a transmission line, the charge density in the conductor may be constantly changing.

On the other hand, the voltage law relies on the fact that the actions of time-varying magnetic fields are confined to individual components, such as inductors. In reality, the induced electric field produced by an inductor is not confined, but the leaked fields are often negligible.

=== Modelling real circuits with lumped elements ===
The lumped element approximation for a circuit is accurate at low frequencies. At higher frequencies, leaked fluxes and varying charge densities in conductors become significant. To an extent, it is possible to still model such circuits using parasitic components. If frequencies are too high, it may be more appropriate to simulate the fields directly using finite element modelling or other techniques.

To model circuits so that both laws can still be used, it is important to understand the distinction between &quot;physical&quot; circuit elements and the &quot;ideal&quot; lumped elements. For example, a wire is not an ideal conductor. Unlike an ideal conductor, wires can inductively and capacitively couple to each other (and to themselves), and have a finite propagation delay. Real conductors can be modeled in terms of lumped elements by considering parasitic capacitances distributed between the conductors to model capacitive coupling, or parasitic (mutual) inductances to model inductive coupling. Wires also have some self-inductance.

==Example==
Assume an electric network consisting of two voltage sources and three resistors.

According to the first law:
formula_8
Applying the second law to the closed circuit , and substituting for voltage using Ohm&#x27;s law gives:
formula_9
The second law, again combined with Ohm&#x27;s law, applied to the closed circuit gives:
formula_10

This yields a system of linear equations in , , :
formula_11
which is equivalent to
formula_12
Assuming
formula_13
the solution is
formula_14

The current has a negative sign which means the assumed direction of was incorrect and is actually flowing in the direction opposite to the red arrow labeled . The current in flows from left to right.

<doc id="591271" wikidata="Q1941127" url="?curid=591271" title="Suvarnabhumi">
<text> (; Pali: &quot;&quot;) is a toponym, that appears in many ancient Indian literary sources and Buddhist texts such as the &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, some of the Jataka tales, the &quot;Milinda Panha&quot; and the &quot;Ramayana&quot;.

Though its exact location is unknown and remains a matter of debate, Suvarṇabhūmi was an important port along trade routes that run through the Indian Ocean, setting sail from the wealthy ports in Basra, Ubullah, and Siraf, through Muscat, Malabar, Ceylon, the Nicobars, Kedah and on through the Strait of Malacca to fabled Suvarṇabhūmi.

Ian Glover, Emeritus Reader in Southeast Asian Archaeology at the University of London, has said: “It is widely accepted in the 21st century that &quot;Suvarnabhumi&quot; as reported in early Indian literature was not a specific location which can be marked on a map. Rather, it was an idealised place, perhaps equivalent to Atlantis in Western history, a distant somewhere to the east of India where traders, sailors, and Buddhist and Hindu teachers went to make their fortunes and spread their teachings and bring back gold and other exotic products desired by a rising elite and the wealthy classes at home.”

==Historiography==

 means &#x27;golden land&#x27; or &#x27;land of gold&#x27; and the ancient sources have associated it with one of a variety of places throughout the Southeast Asian region.

It might also be the source of the Western concept of &quot;Aurea Regio&quot; in Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Trans-Gangetic India&quot; or &quot;India beyond the Ganges,&quot; and the Golden Chersonese of the Greek and Roman geographers and sailors. The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; refers to the Land of Gold, &quot;Chryse&quot;, and describes it as “an island in the ocean, the furthest extremity towards the east of the inhabited world, lying under the rising sun itself, called Chryse... Beyond this country... there lies a very great inland city called &quot;Thina&quot;”. Dionysius Periegetes mentioned: “The island of &quot;Chryse&quot; (Gold), situated at the very rising of the Sun”.

Or, as Priscian put it in his popular rendition of Periegetes: “if your ship… takes you to where the rising sun returns its warm light, then will be seen the Isle of Gold with its fertile soil.” Avienius referred to the &quot;Insula Aurea&quot; (Golden Isle) located where “the Scythian seas give rise to the Dawn”. Josephus speaks of the “&quot;Aurea Chersonesus&quot;”, which he equates with the Biblical Ophir, whence the ships of Tyre and Israel brought back the gold for the Temple of Jerusalem. The city of &quot;Thina&quot; was described by Ptolemy’s &quot;Geography&quot; as the capital city of the country on the eastern shores of the &quot;Magnus Sinus&quot; (Gulf of Thailand).

==Location==

The location of Suvarṇabhūmi has been the subject of much debate, both in scholarly and nationalistic agendas. It remains one of the most mystified and contentious toponyms in Asia. Scholars have identified two regions as possible locations for the ancient Suvarṇabhūmi: Insular Southeast Asia and Southern India. In a study of the various literary sources for the location of Suvarṇabhūmi, Saw Mra Aung concluded that it was impossible to draw a decisive conclusion on this and that only thorough scientific research would reveal which of several versions of Suvarṇabhūmi was the original.

Some have speculated that this country refers to the Kingdom of Funan. The main port of Funan was &quot;Cattigara Sinarum statio&quot; (Kattigara the port of the Sinae).

Due to many factors, including the lack of historical evidence, and the absence of scholarly consensus, various cultures in Southeast Asia identify Suvarṇabhūmi as an ancient kingdom there, and claim ethnic and political descendancy as its successor state. As no such claim or legend existed before the translation and publication of the Edicts, scholars see these claims as based on nationalism or attempts to claim the title of the first Buddhists in Southeast Asia.

===Mainland Southeast Asia===
====Cambodia====

Funan (1st–7th century) was the first kingdom in Cambodian history and it was also the first Indianized kingdom that prospered in Southeast Asia. Both Hinduism and Buddhism flourished in this kingdom. According to the Chinese records, two Buddhist monks from Funan, named Mandrasena and Sanghapala, took up residency in China in the 5th to 6th centuries, and translated several Buddhist sūtras from Sanskrit (or a Prakrit) into Chinese.

The oldest archaeological evidence of Indianized civilization in Southeast Asia comes from central Burma, central and southern Thailand, and the lower Mekong Delta. These finds belong to the period of Funan Kingdom or Nokor Phnom, present-day Cambodia, and South Vietnam including part of Burma, Laos, and Thailand, which was the first political centre established in Southeast Asia. Taking into account the epigraphic and archaeological evidence, the Suvarṇabhūmi mentioned in the early texts must be identified with these areas. Of these areas, only Funan had maritime links with India through its port at Óc Eo. Therefore, although Suvarṇabhūmi in time was broadly applied to all lands east of India, particularly Sumatra, its earliest application was probably to Funan. Furthermore, the Chinese term of “Funan” for Cambodia, may be a transcription of the &quot;Suvaṇṇa&quot; in “Suvaṇṇabhumī”.

In December 2017, Dr Vong Sotheara, of the Royal University of Phnom Penh, discovered a Pre-Angkorian stone inscription in the Province of Kampong Speu, Basedth District, which he tentatively dated to 633 AD. According to him, the inscription would “prove that Suvarnabhumi was the Khmer Empire.” The inscription was issued in the reign of King Isanavarman I (616–637 AD) of the Cambodian Kingdom of Chenla, the successor of Funan and the predecessor of the Khmer Empire. The inscription, translated, read: “The great King Isanavarman is full of glory and bravery. He is the King of Kings, who rules over Suvarnabhumi until the sea, which is the border, while the kings in the neighbouring states honour his order to their heads”. The Inscription is the oldest found mention of Suvarṇabhūmi in Southeast Asia, identifying it with Chenla. The inscription is now exhibited in the National Museum of Cambodia in Phnom Penh. However, his claim and the findings are yet to be peer-reviewed, and remain in doubt with other historians and archaeology experts across the region.

====Myanmar====

Mon tradition maintains that the Thaton Kingdom in Lower Myanmar was called &quot;Suvannabhumi&quot; ( &quot;Thuwunnabhumi&quot;). However, dating the Thaton Kingdom independent of traditional chronicles gives an &quot;terminus post quem&quot; foundation year of 825; even this date remains unattested.

There are several sites within Mon State that local archaeologists cite as Suvarṇabhūmi. Suvarnabhumi City in Bilin Township is one such site with limited excavation work. The site, called Winka Old City by other archaeologists, contains 40 high-grounds of which only four have been excavated. The Winka site, along with nearby walled sites like Kyaikkatha and Kelasa, have been dated as early as the sixth century. While the archaeology of early Lower Burmese sites requires more work, other urban centres in Myanmar like the Sri Ksetra Kingdom in modern Pyay were Buddhist as early as the 5th century.

The scholarly search for &quot;Suvannabhumi&quot; within Myanmar is attached to various nationalistic and religious narratives about Suvannabhumi. The fifteenth century legend of Shwedagon Pagoda enshrining a few hairs of the Buddha brought back by Mon merchants highlights the cultural significance placed on early Buddhist missionaries in Myanmar. In many such legends, the narrative of the conversion of Suvarṇabhūmi is that it Burmanizes key historical Buddhist figures.

====Thailand====
In modern Thailand, government proclamations and national museums insist that &quot;Suwannaphum&quot; was somewhere on the coast of the central plain, especially at the ancient city of U Thong, which might be the origin of the Mon Dvaravati Culture. These claims are not based on any historical records but on archaeological evidence of human settlements in the area dating back more than 4,000 years and the findings of 3rd-century Roman coins. The Thai government named the new Bangkok airport, Suvarnabhumi Airport, after the mythic kingdom of Suwannaphum, honouring this tradition that is still debated by scholars for the same reasons as the Burman claim. Suphan Buri (from the Sanskrit, &quot;Suvarnapura&quot;, &quot;Golden City&quot;) in present west/central Thailand, was founded in 877-882 as a city of the Mon-speaking kingdom of Dvaravati with the name, &quot;Meuang Thawarawadi Si Suphannaphumi&quot; (&quot;the Dvaravati city of Suvarṇabhūmi&quot;), indicating that Dvaravati at that time identified as Suvarṇabhūmi.

According to Thai chronicles, around 241 BCE, during the times that two Buddhist monks named Sona Thera and Uttara Thera came from Magadha to spread Buddhism to Suvarṇabhūmi, the majority of the kingdom&#x27;s population were Mon people, while Thai people arrived later, around 50 BCE. The Suvarnabhumi Kingdom was destroyed by the invasion of Funan around the 1st-2nd centuries, and most of its population was forcibly moved to Funan resulting in it being left abandoned. After Funan lost to Bhavavarman I of Chenla in 550, Suvarṇabhūmi &quot;de facto&quot; became a tributary state of Chenla as well.

The kingdom&#x27;s area reached Lamphakappa Nakhon (ลัมภกัปปะนคร, present-day Lampang) in the north, and was ruled in mandala style with five royal cities, including Suvarnabhumi (the present old town of Nakhon Pathom), Ratchaburi, Singburi, Phetchaburi, and Tanintharyi.

The area surrounding the old capital of Suvarnabhumi was resettled in 590 when Sri Sittichai Phromthep (ท้าวศรีสิทธิไชยพรหมเทพ) from Yossothon (possibly the city in Chenla) established the new city, Nakhon Chai Si (old name of the present-day Nakhon Pathom). Most of its population were Thai people from the Ngao, Yom, and Salween river basins. Lavo was also founded during such a period. Both later created a new kingdom, Dvaravati; however, the new capital together with the other nearest settlement, Pong Tuek (พงตึก, present-day Ratchaburi) were sacked by Chenla 300 years later, around the 8th-9th centuries. After that, the center of Dvaravati culture shifted to Lavo, and the people of the sacked Dvaravati moved westward and founded a new city in 807 in the area of the present-day Ladya subdistrict, Kanchanaburi (Kanchanaburi old city) while the affected area was almost left abandoned. The new settlement was named Suvarṇabhūmi and was then renamed Sri Ayutthaya and Kanchanaburi, respectively.

At the peak of power around the 13th-14th centuries, the border of the new Suvarṇabhūmi or &quot;Suphannabhumi&quot; met Lavo Kingdom at the Pasak River in the east, the west to Dawei on the coast of the outer sea (Andaman Sea), northwest to the south of Mawlamyine, which was the sea trading harbor of the Chaliang Kingdom (Si Satchanalai), while the south to the tip of the Malay Peninsula, and the north to Phraek Siracha (present-day Sankhaburi). In 1351, the Suphannabhumi Kingdom was merged into its succeeding state, Ayuttaya, after its last ruler, Uthong, moved eastward to create a new capital Ayutthaya on present-day Ayutthaya Island.

===Insular Southeast Asia===
A clue referring to the Malay Peninsula came from Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, who referred to it as Golden Chersonese (literally &#x27;golden peninsula&#x27;), which pinpointed exactly that location in South East Asia.

The term Suvarṇabhūmi (&#x27;land of gold&#x27;) is commonly thought to refer to the Southeast Asian Peninsula, including lower Burma and the Malay Peninsula. However there is another gold-referring term Suvarnadvipa (the Golden Island or Peninsula, where “–&quot;dvipa”&quot; may refer to either a peninsula or an island), which may correspond to the Indonesian Archipelago, especially Sumatra. Both terms might refer to a powerful coastal or island kingdom in present-day Indonesia, possibly centered on Sumatra or Java. This corresponds to the gold production areas traditionally known in Minangkabau Highlands in Barisan Mountains, Sumatra, and interior Borneo. The eighth-century Indian text &quot;Samaraiccakaha&quot; describes a sea voyage to &quot;Suvarnadvipa&quot; and the making of bricks from the gold rich sands which they inscribed with the name “&quot;dharana”&quot; and then baked. These pointing out to the direction of western Insular Southeast Asia, especially Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo and Java.

Benefitting from its strategic location on the narrow Strait of Malacca, the insular theory argued that other than actually producing gold, it might also be based on such a kingdom&#x27;s potential for power and wealth (hence, &quot;Land of Gold&quot;) as a hub for sea-trade also known from vague descriptions of contemporary Chinese pilgrims to India. The kingdom referred to as the center of maritime trade between China and India was Srivijaya. Due to the Chinese writing system, however, the interpretations of Chinese historical sources are based on supposed correspondences of ideograms – and their possible phonetic equivalents – with known toponyms in the ancient Southeast Asian civilizations. Hendrik Kern concluded that Sumatra was the &quot;Suvarnadvipa&quot; mentioned in ancient Hindu texts and the island of Chryse mentioned in the &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; and by Rufius Festus Avienius.

The Chinese pilgrim and Buddhist scholar Yijing (義淨), visited the kingdom of Srivijaya on Sumatra in 672 and identified it with &quot;Suvarnadvipa&quot;, the Island of Gold (金洲 &quot;jin-zhou&quot;).

The interpretation of early travel records is not always easy. Javanese embassies to China in 860 and 873 CE refer to Java as rich in gold, although it was in fact devoid of any deposits. The Javanese would have had to import gold possibly from neighbouring Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula or Borneo, where gold was still being mined in the 19th century and where ancient mining sites were located. Even though Java did not have its own gold deposits, the texts make frequent references to the existence of goldsmiths, and it is clear from the archaeological evidence such as Wonoboyo Hoard, that this culture had developed a sophisticated gold working technology, which relied on the import of substantial quantities of the metal.
The Padang Roco Inscription of 1286 CE, states that an image of Buddha Amoghapasa Lokeshvara was brought to Dharmasraya on the Upper Batang Hari - the river of Jambi - was transported from &quot;Bhumi Java&quot; (Java) to &quot;Suvarnabhumi&quot; (Sumatra), and erected by order of the Javanese ruler Kertanegara: the inscription clearly identifies Sumatra as Suvarṇabhūmi.

Butuan on the southern Philippine island of Mindanao was so rich in treasures that a museum curator, Florina H. Capistrano-Baker, stated it was even richer than the more well-known western maritime kingdom of Srivijaya; “The astonishing quantities and impressive quality of gold treasures recovered in Butuan suggest that its flourishing port settlement played an until recently little-recognized role in early Southeast Asian trade. Surprisingly, the amount of gold discovered in Butuan far exceeds that found in Sumatra, where the much better known flourishing kingdom of Srivijaya is said to have been located.” This despite that most of the gold of Butuan were already looted by invaders.

===Bangladesh===
A popular interpretation of Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s poem &quot;Amar Shonar Bangla&quot; serves as the basis for the claim that Suvarṇabhūmi was actually situated in central Bengal at Sonargaon. In some Jain texts, it is mentioned that merchants of Anga (in present-day Bihar, a state of India that borders with Bengal) regularly sailed to Suvarṇabhūmi, and ancient Bengal was in fact situated very close to Anga, connected by rivers of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta. Bengal has also been described in ancient Indian and Southeast Asian chronicles as a &quot;seafaring country&quot;, enjoying trade relations with Dravidian kingdoms, Sri Lanka, Java and Sumatra. Sinhalese tradition holds that the first king of Sri Lanka, Vijaya Singha, came from Bengal. Moreover the region is commonly associated with golden color - the soil of Bengal is known for its golden color (Gangetic alluvial), golden harvest (rice), golden fruits (mangoes), golden minerals (gold and clay) and yellow-brown skinned people. Bengal is described in ancient Sanskrit texts as &#x27;Gaud-Desh&#x27; (Golden/Radiant land). During the reign of the Bengal Sultans and the Mughal Empire, central Bengal was home to a prosperous trading town called &quot;Sonargaon&quot; (Golden village), which was connected to North India by the Grand Trunk Road and was frequented by Arab, Persian and Chinese travelers, including Ibn Battuta and Zheng He. Even today, Bengalis often refer to their land as &quot;&#x27;Shonar Bangla&quot;&#x27; (Golden Bengal), and the national anthem of Bangladesh - &quot;Amar Shonar Bangla&quot; (My Bengal of Gold), from Tagore&#x27;s poem - is a reference to this theory.

== European Age of Discovery==
The thirst for gold formed the most powerful incentive to explorers at the beginning of modern times; but although more and more extensive regions were brought to light by them, they sought in vain in the East Indian Archipelago for the Gold and Silver Islands where, according to the legends, the precious metals were to be gathered from the ground and did not need to be laboriously extracted from the interior of the earth. In spite of their failure, they found it difficult to give up the alluring picture. When they did not find what they sought in the regions which were indicated by the old legends and by the maps based thereon, they hoped for better success in still unexplored regions, and clutched with avidity at every hint that they were here to attain their object.

The history of geography thus shows us how the Gold and Silver Islands were constantly, so to speak, wandering towards the East. Marco Polo spoke, in the most exaggerated language, of the wealth of gold in Zipangu, situated at the extremity of this part of the world, and had thus pointed out where the precious metals should preferably be sought. Martin Behaim, on his globe of 1492, revived the Argyre and Chryse of antiquity in these regions.

In 1519, Cristóvão de Mendonça, was given instructions to search for the legendary Isles of Gold, said to lie to &quot;beyond Sumatra&quot;, which he was unable to do, and in 1587 an expedition under the command of Pedro de Unamunu was sent to find them in the vicinity of Zipangu (Japan). According to Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas, in 1528 Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón in the ship &quot;Florida&quot; on a voyage from the Moluccas to Mexico reached a large island which he took for the &quot;Isla del Oro&quot;. This island has not been identified although it seems likely that it is Biak, Manus or one of the Schouten Islands on the north coast of New Guinea.

<doc id="591273" wikidata="Q629034" url="?curid=591273" title="Tony Montana">
<text>Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Montana is a fictional character and the villain protagonist of the 1983 film &quot;Scarface&quot;. This character is portrayed by Al Pacino in the film and is voiced by André Sogliuzzo in the 2006 video game &quot;&quot;. Embodying the possibility of a person rising from the bottom of society to the top, Tony Montana has become a cultural icon, as well as one of the most iconic film characters of all time.

In 2008, Montana was named the 27th Greatest Movie Character by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine. The character is partly based on Tony Camonte, the protagonist of the 1932 film; Camonte was, in turn, an adaptation of Tony Guarino from the 1929 novel, which in turn was a loose fictionalization of real-life Italian-American gangster Al Capone, who was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1899. In contrast to Guarino and Camonte, who were Italian immigrants, Montana is a Cuban immigrant. According to Oliver Stone, Tony&#x27;s last name was inspired by then-NFL quarterback Joe Montana, Stone&#x27;s favorite player. A prequel novel, &quot;Scarface: The Beginning&quot;, written by L. A. Banks, was published in 2006. Montana has a large scar on his face, which explains why he is known as Scarface. This is the same type of scar that Al Capone received from a bar fight in 1917 at the Harvard Inn.

==Casting==
Pacino insisted on taking the lead role in &quot;Scarface&quot;. Pacino worked with various trainers for the role, including experts in knife combat and boxer Roberto Durán. Durán also helped inspire the character, who had &quot;a certain lion in him&quot;, according to Pacino. Meryl Streep&#x27;s immigrant character in &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1982) also influenced Pacino&#x27;s portrayal of Tony Montana. His co-star Steven Bauer, and a dialect coach, helped him learn aspects of the Cuban dialect and pronunciation.

==Fictional character biography==
Before the events of the film, Tony grew up in a poor Havana neighborhood of Spanish immigrants, his maternal grandparents having been Isleños, while his father&#x27;s side of the family were of Italian descent. He obtained his signature scar fighting a Cuban army officer, whom he killed with a shotgun when he was 13. After being arrested as a young man, Tony joined the Cuban army and served in Angola, where he went AWOL and boarded a cargo ship to France. There, he was arrested for shoplifting and deported back to Cuba in the late 1970s, where he was imprisoned.

In May 1980, Tony is among the 125,000 Cubans on the Mariel boatlift to Miami. When he arrives, he is questioned by U.S. officials and says that he is a &quot;political prisoner&quot;. Tony claims that because he has an American father, he has the right to a green card. However, his request is denied because of a trident-style tattoo on his right hand, which indicates that he was an assassin in prison.

Tony and his friend Manolo &quot;Manny&quot; Ribera are sent to &quot;Freedom town&quot;, a refugee camp that holds Cuban immigrants without green cards. After one month in the camp, Frank Lopez, head of a Miami drug cartel, offers to obtain green cards in return for murdering Emilio Rebenga, a one-time Cuban official who had tortured people to death (Lopez&#x27;s brother among them), only to have Castro turn on him. Soon after Rebenga arrives at the camp, a riot breaks out in Freedom town on August 11, 1980. Manny and Angel Fernandez take advantage of the bedlam to stalk Rebenga, who leaves his tent. Tony is waiting outside and stabs Rebenga in the stomach. Tony and Manny are reconsidered and granted green cards, later being released. The two get jobs as dishwashers for a small food stand in Little Havana. Sometime later, Frank sends his right-hand man, Omar Suarez, to offer them a job that pays $500 each for a few hours of work unloading smuggled marijuana from a boat. While Manny is impressed with the offer, Tony is enraged about being offered less than the minimal pay for such a job, and he and Omar quarrel. On the advice of his companion, Omar then offers Tony and Manny $5,000 to buy cocaine from a new supplier, which is riskier than the marijuana deal, as it requires dealing with Colombians who are notorious for being violent and dishonest.

A few days later, Tony and Manny, and their associates Angel and Chi Chi, drive to a hotel in Miami Beach to make a deal with the group of Colombians. The deal goes badly. A couple of Colombian enforcers handcuff Tony and Angel to a shower pole at gunpoint, threatening to kill them with a chainsaw if Tony doesn&#x27;t reveal the location of the drug money. Tony refuses to talk, causing Hector, the enforcers&#x27; leader, to dismember Angel. Before Hector can do the same to Tony, Manny bursts into the room, shooting a machine pistol. A short gunfight ensues, in which Manny is shot in the arm, and Tony kills the Colombians. Tony, Manny, and Chi Chi escape with the cocaine and the money. Tony, who no longer trusts Omar, takes it to Frank personally. Frank is impressed by this act and offers Tony and Manny the opportunity to work for him. During this time, Tony becomes interested in Frank&#x27;s girlfriend, Elvira Hancock.

Three months later, Tony pays a visit to his mother, Georgina, and younger sister, Gina, neither of whom has seen him for five years. Gina is excited to see Tony, but his mother is ashamed of him, having been aware of his life of crime. When he gives his mother $1,000, she angrily rejects the gift and throws him out. Tony leaves, but Gina runs after him and hugs him, telling him that she has been going to hairdressing school and helping out Mama. Tony says a poor girl like Gina deserves a little fun. He secretly slips her the $1,000 and orders her not to tell Mama about it, only that Mama gets a little bit of it occasionally, through using some of it for grocery shopping or paying a utility bill. Manny, who had been waiting for Tony in the car, is taken with Gina, only for Tony to tell Manny to stay away from her.

Later, while in Bolivia, Tony and Omar go on Frank&#x27;s behalf to see a drug cartel lord, Alejandro Sosa. Sosa kills Omar for being a police informant, and makes Tony his business partner. At The Babylon nightclub, Tony is shaken down by corrupt narcotics detective Mel Bernstein, who informs him that he has evidence linking Tony to the murders of Rebenga and the Colombian drug dealers. Bernstein proposes to &quot;tax&quot; Tony on his transactions in return for police protection and information. Tony is convinced that Frank sent Bernstein, because only Frank would know details about the murders. While talking to Bernstein, Tony sees Gina dancing with a low-level drug dealer. Enraged, Tony beats the dealer and slaps Gina, stopping only after Manny calms him down. Manny drives Gina home and tells her she can do better than those lowlifes and that Tony is only looking out for her. However, when Gina admits an interest in Manny, he freezes, remembering Tony&#x27;s tirade.

Later that night, two men attempt to kill Tony. He escapes and becomes convinced that Frank ordered his death. Tony and Manny track Frank down to his car dealership and kill him and Bernstein with silenced pistols. Afterward, Tony goes to Frank&#x27;s house, telling Elvira that her lover is dead and that he wants her. Over the next year and a half, Tony makes $75 million from the 2,000 kilograms of cocaine he brings to America. He soon makes $10–15 million monthly in profits from his business relationship with Sosa. He marries Elvira and takes over Frank&#x27;s empire, purchasing a large mansion and other luxuries, such as a pet tiger. Tony also creates many legal businesses as fronts, including a hair salon managed by Gina. Cracks in Tony&#x27;s &quot;American dream&quot; begin to form, however, as he and Elvira become addicted to cocaine. His banker demands more money, warning that it is getting increasingly more difficult to hide drug money. Meanwhile, Manny and Gina begin dating behind her brother&#x27;s back, being afraid of Tony&#x27;s wrath should he find out.

When Tony finds a new banker, he turns out to be an undercover policeman who arrests Tony for money laundering and tax evasion. Tony&#x27;s lawyer, George Sheffield, tells Tony that although he can plea bargain away most of the time he&#x27;s facing, he&#x27;ll still end up serving at least three years in prison. Sosa calls Tony down to Bolivia and asks him to help assassinate a Bolivian anti-government activist who threatens to expose Sosa&#x27;s dealings with Bolivian leaders. In exchange, Sosa will use his contacts in the U.S. Justice Department, in Washington, D.C., to keep Tony out of prison. After returning to Miami, Tony does not tell Manny about the hit. However, Manny tries to talk Tony out of going to New York City, simply citing having a bad premonition about it. When Tony makes a scene at a fancy restaurant by insulting Elvira&#x27;s inability to bear children, let alone do anything else with her life, she lashes out and leaves him.

Tony and Sosa&#x27;s associate Alberto travel to New York to assassinate the activist. Alberto plants a bomb under the activist&#x27;s car. He is ordered to detonate it before the activist can implicate Sosa&#x27;s criminal network in a speech at the United Nations Building. On the day set for the assassination, a woman and two children are unexpectedly seen getting into the target&#x27;s car. Tony objects to carrying out the hit, not wanting to kill anyone other than the intended victim. Alberto reminds Tony of Sosa&#x27;s demands, and Tony reluctantly begins to tail the target. However, Tony&#x27;s disgust at possibly killing an innocent woman with her two kids grows while Alberto concentrates on activating the explosive. Before Alberto can detonate the car bomb, Tony angrily shoots and kills Alberto, thus double-crossing Sosa.

Tony returns to Florida and receives a telephone call from a furious Sosa, who chastises him for the failed hit. He says the bomb was found, and the whistleblower is under heavy guard, making it almost impossible for them to try another hit. Tony&#x27;s mother then says she cannot find Gina and accuses him of corrupting her. Tony attempts to locate Gina and finds her with Manny. When he sees them wearing bathrobes, Tony thinks they must be having sexual intercourse. An enraged Tony shoots and kills Manny in a cocaine-fueled rage before Gina reveals that they were just married and would announce it to Tony when he returned home. Tony and his henchmen take a distraught Gina back to his mansion.

Meanwhile, a large group of assassins sent by Sosa surrounds the mansion. While a distraught Tony sits in his office, snorting vast quantities of cocaine, the shooters begin killing his guards outside. At the same time, Tony is oblivious to his closed-circuit cameras (ironically boasting to Manny in an earlier scene that he spent top dollar on the cameras to prevent such an incident). Gina enters Tony&#x27;s office wielding a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 36, accusing him of his selfishness towards her before shooting him in the leg. This startles one assassin who was lying in the wait. He approaches the room out of nowhere and opens fire on Gina, killing her. Tony then shoots the assassin dead.

Deprived of the element of surprise, Sosa&#x27;s shooters attack Tony&#x27;s mansion directly. Tony bursts from his office, wielding an M16 rifle with an M203 grenade launcher attachment. Yelling the iconic line, &quot;Say hello to my little friend!&quot; Tony opens fire on the henchmen, killing numerous, while in turn getting badly wounded by return fire. The carnage continues until Sosa&#x27;s top assassin (&quot;The Skull&quot;) sneaks behind Tony and fatally shoots him with a shotgun. Tony falls from his balcony into a fountain in the lobby below and floats dead in his bloodied pool beneath a statue of the globe carrying the inscription enlightened in pink neon, &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;.

==Comic book==
In 2003, a one-time comic book was published for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, as a pseudo-sequel. Its narrative begins from the end of the film: authorities are assessing the damage done to the Montana mansion, only to discover Tony still alive in the fountain, his apparent lifelessness having been from being heavily drugged. After months in the hospital, Tony is greeted by corrupt cops who say that the federal government seized everything. The book also has Sosa continuing his revenge against Tony and provides some of Sosa&#x27;s backstory, in which he employed poor villagers to make drugs in exchange for financially supporting them, à la Pablo Escobar.

== Video games ==
The 2006 video game &quot;&quot; is a pseudo-sequel to the film, which features an alternate ending wherein Tony kills the Skull and manages to escape from his mansion before Sosa&#x27;s men and the police overrun it. However, he loses all his money and drugs. Presumed dead, he goes into hiding in a small shack near Virginia Key Beach, where he laments the deaths of Manny and Gina, curses himself for not listening, due to his stubbornness, to the advice of others, determines to quit cocaine, and plots his revenge against Sosa. Three months later, Tony comes out of hiding to rebuild his criminal empire and makes $10,000 in a single day of selling drugs, which he uses to bribe several undercover police officers, who have seized his mansion, which allows him to move back. He goes on to expand his empire and eliminate multiple rivals who are eager to take over. He still faces opposition from Sosa and Gaspar Gomez, who have teamed up to form a drug monopoly and set their prices unreasonably high. Tony is also betrayed by his lawyer, George Sheffield, who is in a secret alliance with Sosa and Gomez, and who leads Tony into a trap, which he barely escapes. Eventually, Tony eliminates all his competition in Miami and re-establishes his empire before traveling to the Caribbean to help a cocaine producer called &quot;The Sandman&quot;, who sells him his plantation. During this time, Tony also meets The Sandman&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Venus, with whom he has a relationship. Now the most powerful drug lord in Miami, Tony sets out to exact his revenge on Sosa, Gomez, and Sheffield and attacks Sosa&#x27;s mansion, killing all three of them. On his way out, he stumbles upon one of Sosa&#x27;s surviving goons, whom he spares and hires as his butler. The game ends with Tony married to Venus and living in luxury, and feeling that he finally got what was coming to him: the world. Tony is voiced in the game by André Sogliuzzo as Pacino felt his voice had changed too much between the film and the game to properly reprise the role, although he would hand-pick his successor.

Tony also appears in the 2006 video game, &quot;&quot;

Tony appears in the video game &quot;Payday 2&quot;, as a playable character named &quot;Scarface&quot; included in the &quot;Scarface Character Pack&quot; released in 2016. He is again voiced by André Sogliuzzo. A separate DLC titled &quot;Scarface Heist Pack&quot; contains a heist at Tony&#x27;s mansion in Miami. In 2020, due to a legal arrangement with &quot;Universal Pictures&quot;, the Scarface Character Pack DLC could no longer be purchased by new players, though the Heist Pack remains available.

<text>Liona Maria Carolynne Boyd, (born 11 July 1949) is a Canadian classical guitarist often referred to as the &#x27;First Lady of the Guitar&#x27;.

==Music career==
===Early years===
Boyd was born in London and grew up in Toronto. Her father grew up in Bilbao, Spain, and her mother in Stoke-on-Trent, England. Her grandmother was from Linares, Spain, the birthplace of the &quot;king of the classical guitar&quot;, Andrés Segovia. During her family&#x27;s first of two ocean voyages to Canada she made her debut performance playing &quot;Bluebells of Scotland&quot; on a treble recorder in a talent show on the ship.

When she was thirteen, she was given her first guitar, a Christmas present which her parents had bought in Spain seven years earlier. She took lessons from Eli Kassner, Narciso Yepes, Alirio Díaz, Julian Bream, and Andrés Segovia.

Boyd received a Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Toronto in 1972, graduating with honours. After graduation she studied privately for two years with Alexandre Lagoya in Paris. 

===Performing===
In 1975, she performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City. Andrés Segovia sent her a note that said &quot;through your beauty and talent you will conquer the public, philharmonic or not.&quot; During the same year, she toured northern British Columbia and Yukon. She also toured as the opening act for Canadian folk singer Gordon Lightfoot.

===Recordings===
In 1974, Boyd released her debut album, &quot;The Guitar&quot;. It was produced by Eleanor Koldofsky and was released on Boot Records. The record was distributed internationally by London Records. In 1976, Boyd joined Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada, and established her own publishing company, Mid-Continental Music. In 1989, her album &quot;Christmas Dreams&quot; appeared on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Top Albums chart. To date she has three platinum and four gold albums in Canada.

As of 2018, she has recorded 26 studio albums, made a live recording from Tokyo, created over 25 music videos, and produced three compilation recordings.

During her career, Boyd has recorded with Chet Atkins, Eric Clapton, Al Di Meola, Rik Emmett, David Gilmour, Alex Lifeson, Steve Morse, the Canadian Brass, André Gagnon, Yo Yo Ma, Frank Mills, Strunz &amp; Farah, Roger Whittaker, Gheorghe Zamfir, Pavlo, Jesse Cook, and Olivia Newton-John.

===Recordings===
In 1995, Liona contributed to the Canadian Windows 3.1 computer game The Music Game.

==Personal life==
In 1988, Stoddard Publishing of Toronto, Canada published Boyd&#x27;s autobiography &quot;In My Own Key: My Life in Love and Music&quot;. In it she revealed her eight-year romance with former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. In 1992, Boyd moved to Beverly Hills, California, where she married John B. Simon, a real estate developer.

Following a diagnosis of musician&#x27;s focal dystonia after the release of &quot;Camino Latino&quot;, Boyd was compelled to change how she plays guitar. She reinvented herself by developing her songwriting and singing skills and playing less demanding guitar arrangements.

After divorcing in 2004 she relocated to Miami and started a guitar duo with Srdjan Gjivoje. In 2007 she moved to New Canaan, Connecticut, to make a record with him called &quot;Liona Boyd Sings Songs of Love&quot;. They subsequently toured together. She released a new age album titled &quot;Seven Journeys&quot; which was co-written with her producer Peter Bond. In 2010, she lived in California once more. In 2011, she purchased a house in Palm Beach, Florida but made her home base in Toronto where she recorded 3 more albums produced by Peter Bond. She and accompanist Michael Savona toured Canada extensively. In 2016, Liona formed a new touring duo with Andrew Dolson.

In August 2017, Dundurn Press reissued Boyd&#x27;s first memoir &quot;In My Own Key&quot; and published her second memoir, &quot;No Remedy for Love&quot;.

One of the many revelations in his book was that Boyd claims to have played a private concert for jurors at the murder trial of O. J. Simpson in the mid-1990s. This was at the request of judge Lance Ito who Boyd says was a big fan of her music.

In 2017, Liona filmed &quot;A Winter Fantasy&quot;, a live Christmas special that was broadcast in December 2018 on several PBS stations including WNED-TV in Buffalo, New York.

In 2018, Blackstone Publishing released an audiobook of Liona reading her autobiography &quot;In My Own Key&quot;.

<doc id="591279" wikidata="Q1886953" url="?curid=591279" title="Masahiro Shinoda">
<text>is a Japanese retired film director who had a filmmaking career that spanned over four decades and covered a wide range of genres and styles. He was one of the central figures of the Japanese New Wave during the 1960s and 1970s. He directed films for Shochiku Studio from 1960 to 1965, before turning to independent cinema from 1966 onward. His film style was characterized by socially marginalized characters, many of whom turn to crime or suicide, and meticulous attention to pictorial beauty. He drew on traditional Japanese fiction and theater and some of his films bear the influence of Kenji Mizoguchi, whom he admired.

==Early life==
Shinoda attended Waseda University, where he studied theater and also participated in the Hakone Ekiden long-distance race.

==Career==
He joined the Shōchiku Studio in 1953 as an assistant director, where he worked on films by such directors as Yasujirō Ozu. He debuted as a director in 1960 with &quot;One-Way Ticket for Love&quot;, which he also scripted.

His focus on youth and the cultural and political turmoil of 1960s Japan made him a central figure in the Shōchiku New Wave alongside Nagisa Ōshima and Yoshishige Yoshida. He worked in a variety of genres, from the yakuza film (&quot;Pale Flower&quot;) to the samurai film (&quot;Assassination&quot;), but he particularly became known for his focus on socially marginal characters and for an interest in traditional Japanese theater, which found its greatest expression in &quot;Double Suicide&quot;, in which actors are manipulated like Bunraku puppets. He also was interested in sports, directing a documentary on the 1972 Winter Olympics. Also known for his collaborations with such artists as Shūji Terayama and Tōru Takemitsu, Shinoda left Shōchiku in 1965 to form his own production company, Hyōgensha.

==Awards==
His film &quot;Gonza the Spearman&quot; (1986) was entered into the 36th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won the Silver Bear for an outstanding artistic contribution. He won the 1991 Japan Academy Prize for Director of the Year for &quot;Childhood Days&quot;. His film &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot; (1997) was entered into the 47th Berlin International Film Festival. He also won the Izumi Kyōka Prize in 2010 for a novel (Shinoda himself had earlier adapted a Kyōka novel for the screen for the 1979 film &quot;Demon Pond&quot;).

==Personal life==
Masahiro Shinoda&#x27;s first marriage was with Kazuko Shiraishi, both had a daughter.
In 1967 he married the actress Shima Iwashita, who appears in several of his films. He retired from directing after the release of &quot;Spy Sorge&quot; in 2003, a biopic on the life of Richard Sorge.

<doc id="591280" wikidata="Q911035" url="?curid=591280" title="Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation">
<text>In heat transfer, Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation refers to wavelength-specific radiative emission and absorption by a material body in thermodynamic equilibrium, including radiative exchange equilibrium. It is a special case of Onsager reciprocal relations as a consequence of the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics, also known as microscopic reversibility.

A body at temperature radiates electromagnetic energy. A perfect black body in thermodynamic equilibrium absorbs all light that strikes it, and radiates energy according to a unique law of radiative emissive power for temperature (Stefan–Boltzmann law), universal for all perfect black bodies. Kirchhoff&#x27;s law states that:

Here, the dimensionless coefficient of absorption (or the absorptivity) is the fraction of incident light (power) at each spectral frequency that is absorbed by the body when it is radiating and absorbing in thermodynamic equilibrium.

In slightly different terms, the emissive power of an arbitrary opaque body of fixed size and shape at a definite temperature can be described by a dimensionless ratio, sometimes called the emissivity: the ratio of the emissive power of the body to the emissive power of a black body of the same size and shape at the same fixed temperature. With this definition, Kirchhoff&#x27;s law states, in simpler language:

In some cases, emissive power and absorptivity may be defined to depend on angle, as described below. The condition of thermodynamic equilibrium is necessary in the statement, because the equality of emissivity and absorptivity often does not hold when the material of the body is not in thermodynamic equilibrium.

Kirchhoff&#x27;s law has another corollary: the emissivity cannot exceed one (because the absorptivity cannot, by conservation of energy), so it is not possible to thermally radiate more energy than a black body, at equilibrium. In negative luminescence the angle and wavelength integrated absorption exceeds the material&#x27;s emission; however, such systems are powered by an external source and are therefore not in thermodynamic equilibrium.

== Principle of detailed balance ==
Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation has a refinement in that not only is thermal emissivity equal to absorptivity, it is equal &quot;in detail&quot;. Consider a leaf. It is a poor absorber of green light (around 470 nm), which is why it looks green. By the principle of detailed balance, it is also a poor emitter of green light. 

In other words, if a material, illuminated by black-body radiation of temperature formula_1, is dark (well absorbing) at a certain frequency formula_2, then its own thermal radiation will be strong (well emitting) at the same frequency formula_2 and the same temperature formula_1.

More generally, all intensive properties are balanced in detail. So for example, the absorptivity at a certain incidence direction, for a certain frequency, of a certain polarization, is the same as the emissivity at the same direction, for the same frequency, of the same polarization. This is the principle of detailed balance.
== History ==
Before Kirchhoff&#x27;s law was recognized, it had been experimentally established that a good absorber is a good emitter, and a poor absorber is a poor emitter. Naturally, a good reflector must be a poor absorber. This is why, for example, lightweight emergency thermal blankets are based on reflective metallic coatings: they lose little heat by radiation.

Kirchhoff&#x27;s great insight was to recognize the universality and uniqueness of the function that describes the black body emissive power. But he did not know the precise form or character of that universal function. Attempts were made by Lord Rayleigh and Sir James Jeans 1900–1905 to describe it in classical terms, resulting in Rayleigh–Jeans law. This law turned out to be inconsistent yielding the ultraviolet catastrophe. The correct form of the law was found by Max Planck in 1900, assuming quantized emission of radiation, and is termed Planck&#x27;s law. This marks the advent of quantum mechanics.

== Theory ==

In a blackbody enclosure that contains electromagnetic radiation with a certain amount of energy at thermodynamic equilibrium, this &quot;photon gas&quot; will have a Planck distribution of energies.

One may suppose a second system, a cavity with walls that are opaque, rigid, and not perfectly reflective to any wavelength, to be brought into connection, through an optical filter, with the blackbody enclosure, both at the same temperature. Radiation can pass from one system to the other. For example, suppose in the second system, the density of photons at narrow frequency band around wavelength formula_5 were higher than that of the first system. If the optical filter passed only that frequency band, then there would be a net transfer of photons, and their energy, from the second system to the first. This is in violation of the second law of thermodynamics, which requires that there can be no net transfer of heat between two bodies at the same temperature.

In the second system, therefore, at each frequency, the walls must absorb and emit energy in such a way as to maintain the black body distribution. Hence absorptivity and emissivity must be equal. The absorptivity formula_6 of the wall is the ratio of the energy absorbed by the wall to the energy incident on the wall, for a particular wavelength. Thus the absorbed energy is formula_7 where formula_8 is the intensity of black-body radiation at wavelength formula_5 and temperature formula_1. Independent of the condition of thermal equilibrium, the emissivity of the wall is defined as the ratio of emitted energy to the amount that would be radiated if the wall were a perfect black body. The emitted energy is thus formula_11 where formula_12 is the emissivity at wavelength formula_5. For the maintenance of thermal equilibrium, these two quantities must be equal, or else the distribution of photon energies in the cavity will deviate from that of a black body. This yields Kirchhoff&#x27;s law:

formula_14

By a similar, but more complicated argument, it can be shown that, since black-body radiation is equal in every direction (isotropic), the emissivity and the absorptivity, if they happen to be dependent on direction, must again be equal for any given direction.

Average and overall absorptivity and emissivity data are often given for materials with values which &quot;differ&quot; from each other. For example, white paint is quoted as having an absorptivity of 0.16, while having an emissivity of 0.93. This is because the absorptivity is averaged with weighting for the solar spectrum, while the emissivity is weighted for the emission of the paint itself at normal ambient temperatures. The absorptivity quoted in such cases is being calculated by:

formula_15

while the average emissivity is given by:

formula_16

where formula_17 is the emission spectrum of the sun, and formula_11 is the emission spectrum of the paint. Although, by Kirchhoff&#x27;s law, formula_19 in the above equations, the above &quot;averages&quot; formula_20 and formula_21 are not generally equal to each other. The white paint will serve as a very good insulator against solar radiation, because it is very reflective of the solar radiation, and although it therefore emits poorly in the solar band, its temperature will be around room temperature, and it will emit whatever radiation it has absorbed in the infrared, where its emission coefficient is high.

=== Planck&#x27;s derivation ===

Historically, Planck derived the black body radiation law and detailed balance according to a classical thermodynamic argument, with a single heuristic step, which was later interpreted as a quantization hypothesis.

In Planck&#x27;s set up, he started with a large Hohlraum at a fixed temperature formula_1. At thermal equilibrium, the Hohlraum is filled with a distribution of EM waves at thermal equilibrium with the walls of the Hohlraum. Next, he considered connecting the Hohlraum to a single small resonator, such as Hertzian resonators. The resonator reaches a certain form of thermal equilibrium with the Hohlraum, when the spectral input into the resonator equals the spectral output at the resonance frequency. 

Next, suppose there are two Hohlraums at the same fixed temperature formula_1, then Planck argued that the thermal equilibrium of the small resonator is the same when connected to either Hohlraum. For, we can disconnect the resonator from one Hohlraum and connect it to another. If the thermal equilibrium were different, then we have just transported energy from one to another, violating the second law. Therefore, the spectrum of all black bodies are identical at the same temperature.

Using a heuristic of quantization, which he gleaned from Boltzmann, Planck argued that a resonator tuned to frequency formula_2, with average energy formula_25, would contain entropyformula_26for some constant formula_27 (later termed the Planck constant). Then applying formula_28, Planck obtained the black body radiation law.

Another argument that does not depend on the precise form of the entropy function, can be given as follows. Next, suppose we have a material that violates Kirchhoff&#x27;s law when integrated, such that the total coefficient of absorption is not equal to the coefficient of emission at a certain formula_1, then if the material at temperature formula_1 is placed into a Hohlraum at temperature formula_1, it would spontaneously emit more than it absorbs, or conversely, thus spontaneously creating a temperature difference, violating the second law.

Finally, suppose we have a material that violates Kirchhoff&#x27;s law &quot;in detail&quot;, such that the total coefficient of absorption is not equal to the coefficient of emission at a certain formula_1 and &quot;at a certain frequency&quot; formula_2, then since it does not violate Kirchhoff&#x27;s law when integrated, there must exist two frequencies formula_34, such that the material absorbs more than it emits at formula_35, and conversely at formula_36. Now, place this material in one Hohlraum. It would spontaneously create a shift in the spectrum, making it higher at formula_36 than at formula_35. However, this then allows us to tap from one Hohlraum with a resonator tuned at formula_36, then detach and attach to another Hohlraum at the same temperature, thus transporting energy from one to another, violating the second law.

We may apply the same argument for polarization and direction of radiation, obtaining the full principle of detailed balance.

==Black bodies==

===Near-black materials===

It has long been known that a lamp-black coating will make a body nearly black. Some other materials are nearly black in particular wavelength bands. Such materials do not survive all the very high temperatures that are of interest.

An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured carbon nanotubes. Nano-porous materials can achieve refractive indices nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.

===Opaque bodies===

Bodies that are opaque to thermal radiation that falls on them are valuable in the study of heat radiation. Planck analyzed such bodies with the approximation that they be considered topologically to have an interior and to share an interface. They share the interface with their contiguous medium, which may be rarefied material such as air, or transparent material, through which observations can be made. The interface is not a material body and can neither emit nor absorb. It is a mathematical surface belonging jointly to the two media that touch it. It is the site of refraction of radiation that penetrates it and of reflection of radiation that does not. As such it obeys the Helmholtz reciprocity principle. The opaque body is considered to have a material interior that absorbs all and scatters or transmits none of the radiation that reaches it through refraction at the interface. In this sense the material of the opaque body is black to radiation that reaches it, while the whole phenomenon, including the interior and the interface, does not show perfect blackness. In Planck&#x27;s model, perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature, besides their opaque interior, have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.

===Cavity radiation===

The walls of a cavity can be made of opaque materials that absorb significant amounts of radiation at all wavelengths. It is not necessary that every part of the interior walls be a good absorber at every wavelength. The effective range of absorbing wavelengths can be extended by the use of patches of several differently absorbing materials in parts of the interior walls of the cavity. In thermodynamic equilibrium the cavity radiation will precisely obey Planck&#x27;s law. In this sense, thermodynamic equilibrium cavity radiation may be regarded as thermodynamic equilibrium black-body radiation to which Kirchhoff&#x27;s law applies exactly, though no perfectly black body in Kirchhoff&#x27;s sense is present.

A theoretical model considered by Planck consists of a cavity with perfectly reflecting walls, initially with no material contents, into which is then put a small piece of carbon. Without the small piece of carbon, there is no way for non-equilibrium radiation initially in the cavity to drift towards thermodynamic equilibrium. When the small piece of carbon is put in, it radiation frequencies so that the cavity radiation comes to thermodynamic equilibrium.

===A hole in the wall of a cavity===

For experimental purposes, a hole in a cavity can be devised to provide a good approximation to a black surface, but will not be perfectly Lambertian, and must be viewed from nearly right angles to get the best properties. The construction of such devices was an important step in the empirical measurements that led to the precise mathematical identification of Kirchhoff&#x27;s universal function, now known as Planck&#x27;s law.

===Kirchhoff&#x27;s perfect black bodies===

Planck also noted that the perfect black bodies of Kirchhoff do not occur in physical reality. They are theoretical fictions. Kirchhoff&#x27;s perfect black bodies absorb all the radiation that falls on them, right in an infinitely thin surface layer, with no reflection and no scattering. They emit radiation in perfect accord with Lambert&#x27;s cosine law.

==Original statements==

Gustav Kirchhoff stated his law in several papers in 1859 and 1860, and then in 1862 in an appendix to his collected reprints of those and some related papers.

Prior to Kirchhoff&#x27;s studies, it was known that for total heat radiation, the ratio of emissive power to absorptive ratio was the same for all bodies emitting and absorbing thermal radiation in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that a good absorber is a good emitter. Naturally, a good reflector is a poor absorber. For wavelength specificity, prior to Kirchhoff, the ratio was shown experimentally by Balfour Stewart to be the same for all bodies, but the universal value of the ratio had not been explicitly considered in its own right as a function of wavelength and temperature.

Kirchhoff&#x27;s original contribution to the physics of thermal radiation was his postulate of a perfect black body radiating and absorbing thermal radiation in an enclosure opaque to thermal radiation and with walls that absorb at all wavelengths. Kirchhoff&#x27;s perfect black body absorbs all the radiation that falls upon it.

Every such black body emits from its surface with a spectral radiance that Kirchhoff labeled (for specific intensity, the traditional name for spectral radiance).

The precise mathematical expression for that universal function was very much unknown to Kirchhoff, and it was just postulated to exist, until its precise mathematical expression was found in 1900 by Max Planck. It is nowadays referred to as Planck&#x27;s law.

Then, at each wavelength, for thermodynamic equilibrium in an enclosure, opaque to heat rays, with walls that absorb some radiation at every wavelength:

<text>Father Time is a weathervane at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, London, in the shape of Father Time removing the bails from a wicket. The full weathervane is tall, with the figure of Father Time standing at . It was given to Lord&#x27;s in 1926 by the architect of the Grandstand, Sir Herbert Baker. The symbolism of the figure derives from Law 12(3) of the Laws of Cricket: &quot;After the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets.&quot; The weathervane is frequently referred to as Old Father Time in television and radio broadcasts, but &quot;Old&quot; is not part of its official title.

&quot;Father Time&quot; was originally located atop the old Grand Stand. It was wrenched from its position during the Blitz, when it became entangled in the steel cable of a barrage balloon, but was repaired and returned to its previous place. In 1992 it was struck by lightning, and the subsequent repairs were featured on the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Blue Peter.&quot; &quot;Father Time&quot; was permanently relocated to a structure adjacent to the Mound Stand in 1996, when the Grand Stand was demolished and rebuilt. It was again damaged in March 2015 by the high winds of Cyclone Niklas, which necessitated extensive repair by specialists.

In 1969 &quot;Father Time&quot; became the subject of a poem, &quot;Lord&#x27;s Test&quot;, by the Sussex and England cricketer John Snow.

<doc id="591309" wikidata="Q1130705" url="?curid=591309" title="A Bronx Tale">
<text>A Bronx Tale is a 1993 American coming-of-age crime drama film directed by and starring Robert De Niro in his directorial debut and produced by Jane Rosenthal, adapted from Chazz Palminteri&#x27;s 1989 one-man show play of the same name. It tells the coming-of-age story of an Italian-American boy, Calogero, who, after encountering a local Mafia boss, is torn between the temptations of organized crime and the values of his honest, hardworking father, as well as racial tensions in his community. The Broadway production was converted to film with limited changes, and starred Palminteri and De Niro.

De Niro, who first viewed the play in Los Angeles in 1990, acquired the rights from Palminteri, with the intent of making the play his directorial debut. The duo worked heavily together on the screenplay, with Palminteri aiming to retain many of the aspects of the original script, as it was based largely on his own childhood. Production began in 1991, and was funded in collaboration with De Niro&#x27;s TriBeCa Productions and Savoy Pictures, as the first film released by each studio.

&quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 1993, and released in the United States on September 29, 1993. The film achieved limited commercial success, grossing over $17 million domestically. However, it fared much better with critics, who praised the performances of the leads, and launched Palminteri&#x27;s acting career, while also helping De Niro gain acceptance as a director.

==Plot==

In 1960, nine-year-old Calogero lives in Belmont, a working-class Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx with his father, Lorenzo, a Surface Transit (later MTA) bus driver, and his mother, Rosina. Calogero becomes enamored of the Mafia presence in his neighborhood led by local boss Sonny. One day, Calogero sees Sonny shoot and kill a man assaulting his friend. Calogero keeps quiet when questioned by NYPD detectives. Sonny&#x27;s men offer Lorenzo a better-paying job but, preferring a law-abiding life, he politely declines. Sonny befriends Calogero and gives him the nickname &quot;C&quot;. Calogero earns tips working in Sonny&#x27;s bar and throwing dice, and is admonished by Lorenzo when he discovers the cash. Lorenzo returns the money to Sonny and warns him to keep away from Calogero.

Eight years later, a 17-year-old Calogero has been visiting Sonny regularly without his father&#x27;s knowledge. Calogero is part of a gang of local Italian-American boys, which concerns Sonny, who doesn&#x27;t wish him a life of crime. Calogero meets an African-American girl, Jane, and a tentative romance blossoms between them. Despite the high racial tensions between Italian-Americans and African-Americans in the area, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from Sonny, who lends Calogero his car to impress her. Earlier, Calogero&#x27;s friends beat up a group of African-American cyclists riding through their neighborhood. One of the cyclists turns out to be Jane&#x27;s brother, who accuses Calogero of beating him up when he and Jane meet for their date. Calogero loses his temper over the accusation, and calls him a nigger, which he instantly regrets. Jane, disappointed, leaves with her brother.

At home, Lorenzo confronts Calogero after seeing him driving Sonny&#x27;s car. They argue and Calogero storms out. He runs into his friends, who tell him that some African-Americans egged their social club in retaliation to the earlier beating. Sonny and his crew confront Calogero after finding a bomb on Sonny&#x27;s car. Calogero tearfully pleads his unwavering dedication to Sonny, who recognizes his innocence and allows him to leave. Calogero meets up with friends, who plan revenge on the African-Americans using Molotov cocktails. They pressure Calogero into participating, but Sonny stops their car and orders Calogero out. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that her brother admitted that Calogero was not his assailant. Jane and Calogero make amends, but he suddenly remembers his friends&#x27; plans to attack Jane&#x27;s neighborhood, and the two rush to stop them. During the attack, an African-American shopkeeper throws an unbroken Molotov cocktail back at the boys&#x27; car, which enters through the window and ignites the Molotov cocktails still inside, causing an explosion that kills everyone inside. When Calogero and Jane arrive, they find the car engulfed in flames.

Calogero leaves and rushes into Sonny&#x27;s bar to thank him for saving his life, but a young man (who had planted the bomb) shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. Calogero later learns that the killer was sent to avenge his father&#x27;s death from eight years earlier. At Sonny&#x27;s funeral, countless people come to pay their respects, but, as Sonny had once stated, none seem to really care about his death. When everyone but Calogero disperses, a lone man, Carmine, visits the funeral, and tells Calogero that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not recognize Carmine until he sees a scar on his forehead and realizes he was the man Sonny defended. Carmine tells Calogero that he is filling in for Sonny in the neighborhood for the time being and promises Calogero help should he ever need it. Carmine leaves just as Lorenzo unexpectedly arrives to pay his respects to Sonny. Lorenzo thanks him for saving his son&#x27;s life and admits that he never hated him, but that he resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero bids Sonny goodbye and walks home with Lorenzo while narrating the lessons he learned from his two mentors.

==Production==
The film is based on Chazz Palminteri&#x27;s original play of the same name, which was performed as a one-man show, being largely based on his own childhood, specifically the shooting Calogero witnesses as a child, as well as the occupation and name of his father.

In 1990, at a performance of &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot;, Robert De Niro met with Palminteri in his dressing room after having seen the show. De Niro told Palminteri, &quot;This is one of the greatest one-man shows I&#x27;ve ever seen, if not the greatest ... This is a movie, this is an incredible movie.&quot; After acquiring the rights to create the film, with De Niro claiming the deal was made solely with a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement with Palminteri, the duo began crafting the screenplay. Prior to partnering with De Niro, Palminteri rejected several offers for the film&#x27;s rights, including some as high as $1 million, due to not being granted the roles of primary screenwriter and Sonny, the gangster Calogero meets. De Niro met Palminteri&#x27;s requirements on the condition that he be allowed to direct the film and play Lorenzo, Calogero&#x27;s father, which Palminteri accepted.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; sets itself apart from other coming-of-age dramas thanks to a solid script, a terrific cast, and director Robert De Niro&#x27;s sensitive work behind the camera.&quot; Metacritic gave it a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, calling it &quot;very funny [and] very touching. It is filled with life and colorful characters and great lines of dialogue, and De Niro, in his debut as a director, finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears [while] retaining its values.&quot;

In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list.

== 30th Anniversary restoration ==
To celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; in 2023, Tribeca Productions along with technology and distribution partner, Giant Pictures, undertook a 4K digital restoration of the film. The original negative was provided by the Harry Ransom Center film archive at the University of Texas at Austin, which houses the Robert De Niro collection. The film master and audio were digitally scanned and restored to create an ultra high definition 4K version of the film. The digital coloring process was handled at Goldcrest Post in New York and was overseen personally by director Robert De Niro. The restoration took 9 months to complete.

Coinciding with the 30th anniversary itself on September 29, 2023, Tribeca and Giant Pictures released the 4K version on UHD Blu-ray in the US, as well as on video on demand platforms, including Apple TV and Vudu. Titled &quot;A Bronx Tale (30th Anniversary Edition)&quot;, this release showcased the new restoration in Ultra High Definition Dolby Vision and Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround sound. The UHD Blu-ray edition included new interviews with director and star Robert De Niro and writer and star Chazz Palminteri, reflecting on how the film has become a beloved classic with audiences, as well as recalling the original production process, how the screenplay was adapted and the authenticity of the film&#x27;s characters.

<doc id="591312" wikidata="Q782749" url="?curid=591312" title="Yuri's Night">
<text>Yuri&#x27;s Night is an international celebration held every April 12 to commemorate milestones in space exploration. It is named for the first human to launch into space, Yuri Gagarin, who flew the Vostok 1 spaceship on April 12, 1961. In 2011, Yuri&#x27;s Night was celebrated at over 567 events in 75 countries on seven continents. Yuri&#x27;s Night is often called the &quot;World Space Party&quot;. The launch of STS-1, the first Space Shuttle mission, is also honored, as it was launched 20 years to the day after Vostok 1, on April 12, 1981 (although the date of STS-1 is just a coincidence, the launch having had been delayed for two days due to a technical problem).

==Objective==

The goal of Yuri&#x27;s Night is to increase public interest in space exploration and to inspire a new generation of explorers. Driven by space-inspired artistic expression and culminating in a worldwide network of annual celebrations and educational events, Yuri&#x27;s Night creates a global community of young people committed to shaping the future of space exploration while developing responsible leaders and innovators with a global perspective. These global events are a showcase for elements of culture that embrace space including music, dance, fashion, and art.

==History of Yuri&#x27;s Night==

Yuri&#x27;s Night was created in 2000 by Loretta Hidalgo Whitesides, George T. Whitesides and Trish Garner. The first Yuri&#x27;s Night was held on April 12, 2001, exactly 40 years after the launch of Vostok 1. Since 1962, April 12 has been celebrated in Russia (formerly the Soviet Union) as Cosmonautics Day ()
and since 2011 internationally as the International Day of Human Space Flight.

The 2004 Yuri&#x27;s Night event in Los Angeles was attended by space-related figures including author Ray Bradbury, space tourist Dennis Tito, X-Prize founder Peter Diamandis, *NSYNC&#x27;s Lance Bass, and Nichelle Nichols (Uhura from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series). The event included a large party with two dance floors and world-class DJs.

The 2007 event in the San Francisco Bay Area was held at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field in Mountain View, CA. The event featured artistic installations, technology demonstrations, and DJ music continuing through dawn of the following day.

April 2011 marked the 50th anniversary of Gagarin&#x27;s historic first flight. Over 100,000 people attended 567 Yuri&#x27;s Night parties in 75 countries, and the crew of Expedition 27 recorded a Yuri&#x27;s Night celebratory greeting from the International Space Station.

In April 2021, Yuri&#x27;s Night was held virtually amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The event consisted of a hosted global live stream alongside some private, ticketed virtual events. Some notable guests included Brian May, Bill Nye, Tim Dodd, and Richard Branson.

In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Space Foundation announced that it would change the name of its 2022 Yuri&#x27;s Night celebrations from &quot;Yuri&#x27;s Night&quot; to &quot;A Celebration of Space: Discover What&#x27;s Next&quot; as part of a large-scale boycott of Russia in solidarity with Ukraine because Yuri Gagarin was born in Russia. Gagarin&#x27;s spaceflight was flown in the name of the entire Soviet Union, dissolved in 1991, which included among other Soviet Republics, both Russia and Ukraine.

==Yuri&#x27;s Night today==

Yuri&#x27;s Night events &quot;combine space-themed partying with education and outreach&quot;. Parties and events are held at NASA centers, museums, planetariums, schools, bars, nightclubs, houses, and other locations. Often, guests are encouraged to dress up in various space-themed attire to add to the ambiance of the show. Space-themed art, sculptures and guests are often showcased at the events. Event sizes range from small to large and often attract large crowds with headlining musical acts such as Les Claypool, N*E*R*D, Common, NASA, and The Crystal Method.

Yuri&#x27;s Night has been celebrated in locations including Reno, Ottawa, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, Huntsville, Alabama, New Orleans, Inverness, Stockholm, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, Lisbon, Helsinki, Afghanistan, Nairobi, Latvia, Romania, Peru, Antarctica, and the International Space Station, in addition to many other locations and virtual online celebrations.

Yuri&#x27;s Night is organized on a global level by an all-volunteer &quot;Executive Team&quot;, which provides logistical and promotional support to Yuri&#x27;s Night events worldwide. Individual organizers are responsible for registering and running their local events.

<text>The Cheating Culture: Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead is a nonfiction book, authored by David Callahan and published by Harcourt in 2004.

==Synopsis==

The main thesis of the book is that the current state of American society, characterized by rampant inequality and a winner-take-all philosophy, produces the cheating that has been observed in business, law, academia, journalism, entertainment and medicine.

Cheating, of both illegal and legal forms, is pervasive in an American society where incentive-driven structures (e.g. stock options, production-based pay, fast-track career options) have gone haywire: Instead of promoting productivity and &quot;fair play&quot;, they reward deception and chicanery. Callahan provides multiple examples of this phenomenon in recent American history.

In the 1980, when Sears instituted a production quota for its auto repair staff, mechanics began performing unnecessary and costly maintenance. Overbilling is common within the legal profession. Pressed to bill as much time as possible, young lawyers may overcharge clients. In the medical profession, physicians may overstate the symptoms of managed care patients, else insurers would deny coverage.

Not restricted to professions, cheating now appears in all facets of American life. According to Callahan, cheating breeds upon a dynamic between a &quot;winner class&quot;, an upper-class so influential they effectively are exempt from most rules and standards, and an &quot;anxious class&quot;, often compelled to cheat during a period of downward social mobility, downsizing, and within a cultural climate that values money and power above personal integrity.

Callahan shows, however, that large-scale cheating is most prevalent among the &quot;Winner&quot; upper class. Despite their high salaries and opulent lifestyles, they live in constant comparison with those who have more than them, and therefore exhibit lives characterized by high spending, severe anxiety, and countless opportunities and temptations to cheat.

The author, however, also notes that blame for the cheating phenomenon does not lie upon a single class of people. Rather, it represents the individualistic ambitions of the amorphously defined &quot;Me&quot; generation, mixed dangerously with laissez-faire principles espoused by the 1980s neoliberals, and implemented, to America&#x27;s detriment, during the &quot;get-rich-quick&quot; era of the 1980s and 1990s.

While speaking about the book in Denver, Colorado, Callahan said that the level of the public&#x27;s trust is low to the point of being &quot;poisonous&quot;. Throughout his book, he states that cynical attitudes and lack of trust in others produce cheating. For example, one expecting to be &quot;screwed&quot; by others is more likely to cheat others, in order to compensate. Members of &quot;higher&quot; socio-economic groups frequently victimize members of &quot;lower&quot; socio-economic groups. The 1980s and 1990s were characterized by an emphasis on self-interest, maintaining the individualism and anticonformism of the 1960s but shedding the community-oriented ideals of social responsibility and personal integrity. American society has a &quot;schizophrenic personality&quot;: it tends to cyclically alternate between a spirit of self-interest, and an attitude of communal interest. The last period of vulgar self-interest, according to Callahan, was during the American 1920s, prior to Black Tuesday and the onset of the Great Depression.

<text>Nāgasena was a Sarvāstivādan Buddhist sage who lived around 150 BC. His answers to questions about Buddhism posed by Menander I (Pali: &quot;Milinda&quot;), the Indo-Greek king of northwestern India, are recorded in the &quot;Milindapañhā&quot; and the Sanskrit Nāgasenabhiksusūtra. 
According to Pali accounts, he was born into a Brahmin family in the Himalayas and was well-versed in the Vedas at an early age. However, he later converted to Buddhism.

==&quot;Milinda Pañha&quot;== 
There is almost universal agreement that a core text was later expanded by numerous other authors, following a question and answer pattern established in the early books. The version extant today is very long, and has signs of inconsistent authorship in the later volumes. There is no agreed-upon point at which Nagasena&#x27;s authorship may be said to end (and the work of other hands begins), nor has this been perceived as an inherently important distinction by monastic scholars.

The text mentions that Nagasena learned the Tripiṭaka under the Greek Buddhist monk Dhammarakkhita near Pātaliputta (modern Patna). He also reached enlightenment and became an arhat under his guidance.

Other personalities mentioned in the text are Nāgasena&#x27;s father Soñuttara, his teachers Rohana, Assagutta of Vattaniya and another teacher named Āyupāla from Sankheyya near Sāgala.

==Thai tradition==
There is a tradition that Nagasena brought to Thailand the first representation of the Buddha, the Emerald Buddha. According to this legend, the Emerald Buddha would have been created in India in 43 BC by Nagasena in the city of Pātaliputta.
Nagasena is not known through other sources besides the Milinda Panha and this legend.

==Depictions==
Nāgasena is one of the Eighteen Arhats of Mahayana Buddhism. His traditional textile depiction shows him holding a khakkhara in his right hand and a vase in his left; an excellent example can be seen on one of the thangkas in the Cleveland Museum of Art collection. &quot;This figure [conforms with the image of] the arhat Nagasena, shown in Jivarama&#x27;s sketchbook of 1435&quot; who also holds a vase.

A similar depiction can be seen in the collection of Singapore&#x27;s Asian Civilisations Museum (Qianlong era, 18C: thangka with silk appliqué.)

More modern statues often show a bald, elderly monk scratching his ear with a stick to symbolize purification of the sense of hearing. An adherent of Buddhism should avoid listening to gossip and other nonsense so that they are always prepared to hear the truth.

<text>Western Kentucky University is a public university in Bowling Green, Kentucky, United States. It was founded by the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1906, though its roots reach back a few decades earlier. It operates regional campuses in Glasgow, Elizabethtown-Fort Knox, and Owensboro. The main campus sits atop a hill overlooking the Barren River valley.

==History==
The roots of Western Kentucky University go back to 1876 with the founding by A. W. Mell of the privately owned Glasgow Normal School and Business College in Glasgow, Kentucky. This moved to Bowling Green in 1884 and became the Southern Normal School and Business College. In 1890, Potter College was opened as a private women&#x27;s college by Pleasant J. Potter. In 1906, Henry Hardin Cherry sold the Southern Normal School and became president of the Western Kentucky State Normal School, which had just been created by an act of the Kentucky General Assembly. Southern&#x27;s student body and its building became the new school, with classes beginning on January 22, 1907. In 1909 Potter College closed and Western bought the buildings and property of the school. In 1911, Western relocated to its present site on the property that had been Potter College.

In 1922, the school was authorized by the state to grant four-year degrees and was renamed Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College. The first four-year degrees were awarded in 1924. In 1927, the school merged with Ogden College, which occupied an adjacent campus. The name changed again in 1930 to Western Kentucky State Teachers College. The school was authorized to offer the Master of Arts degree in 1931. Another name change took place in 1948 when the school became simply Western Kentucky State College.

WKSC merged with the Bowling Green College of Commerce, which had formerly been the Bowling Green Business University, in 1963. Bowling Green Business University had originally been a part of the Southern Normal School and had been sold off by Henry Hardin Cherry when Southern Normal School was transferred to the state. The structure of the institution changed at this time, divided into separate colleges. Bowling Green College of Commerce maintained its identity in this way. The Graduate School also became a constituent college. In 1965, three additional colleges were created. In 1966, Western Kentucky State College became Western Kentucky University.

For many years, the college was popularly known as &quot;Western&quot;, as indicated in its fight song, &quot;Stand Up and Cheer&quot;. However, administrators in recent years have preferred to call it &quot;WKU.&quot;

On July 1, 2017, Timothy C. Caboni became the university&#x27;s 10th president. Dr. Caboni earned a Master of Arts in Organizational and Corporate Communication from WKU in 1994. Prior to his time at WKU, Dr. Caboni spent time in leadership positions at The University of Kansas and Vanderbilt University.

===Presidents ===

Western Kentucky University officially lists ten presidents since the formation of the Office of the President.

&quot;Note:&quot; Paul Cook served as interim president from 1985 to 1986

==Academics==
Western Kentucky University houses five academic colleges, an honors college, and a graduate school.
* College of Education and Behavioral Sciences
* Ogden College of Science &amp; Engineering
* Potter College of Arts &amp; Letters
* Gordon Ford College of Business
* College of Health and Human Services
* Mahurin Honors College
* The Graduate School

, twenty-seven alumni of WKU&#x27;s photo and print journalism programs have been awarded thirteen Pulitzer Prizes, including eleven alumni recognized for their coverage of the Carrollton bus crash. The school publishes a twice-weekly newspaper, the &quot;College Heights Herald.&quot;

===Mahurin Honors College===
The WKU Honors College became the first Honors College in the Commonwealth of Kentucky on July 1, 2007. The Honors College serves over 1,300 active Honors students with the 2016 incoming freshman class ACT/SAT average ranking among the top 6% in the nation.

===Center for Gifted Studies===
WKU&#x27;s Center for Gifted Studies conducts research and provides opportunities for gifted and talented students, educators, and parents.

===The Carol Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky===
The Carol Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky opened in the Fall of 2007. The project is based on the University of North Texas&#x27;s Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science. The school accepts roughly 100 high school juniors each year. As incoming juniors, students can earn at least 60 college credit hours during their time at the school. The Gatton Academy was named &quot;America&#x27;s Best High School&quot; by &quot;Newsweek&quot; in 2012 and 2013. The building, originally designed in 1929, was renovated and expanded by RossTarrant Architects to transform it into the Gatton Academy.

==Athletics==
The Western Kentucky (WKU) athletic teams are called the &quot;Hilltoppers&quot; (men&#x27;s) and &quot;Lady Toppers&quot; (women&#x27;s). Their mascot is known as Big Red. The mascot has appeared in a series of ESPN promotions. The university is a member of the NCAA Division I ranks, primarily competing in the Conference USA (C-USA) since the 2014–15 academic year. The Hilltoppers and Lady Toppers previously competed in the Sun Belt Conference from 1982–83 to 2013–14; and in the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) from 1948–49 to 1981–82.

WKU competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

===Swimming===
The WKU swim team, before its suspension after the 2014–15 season, consistently placed in the top 5 in the Mid-Major National Rankings. In 2006 their men were undefeated in dual meets and were Sun Belt Conference Champions. The women won five consecutive championships from 2001 to 2005. In 2005, after 37 years as head coach, coach Bill Powell became an assistant coach, and holds the record for being the second-winningest coach in men&#x27;s swimming in NCAA dual meet history.

Following the Western Kentucky University swim team hazing scandal in 2015, which revealed incidents of hazing dating back to at least 2012, the university placed the entire program on a five-year suspension. However, as of 2024, the program has not been revived.

===Baseball===
The baseball team has enjoyed some success, winning the Sun Belt Conference tournament championship in 2009. In April 2010, the WKU baseball team defeated the University of Kentucky 24–8 in a game at Bowling Green Ballpark. The crowd of 6,183 was the largest crowd to ever attend a WKU home baseball game.

===Basketball===


The men&#x27;s basketball program claims to have the 14th most victories in the history of the NCAA.

The men&#x27;s basketball team defeated Middle Tennessee in the 2008 Sun Belt Conference tournament championship game to get a bid into the 2008 NCAA Tournament. The Hilltoppers won their first-round contest against Drake on a last-second three-pointer by Ty Rogers, and won their second-round game against San Diego, before losing to UCLA 88–78 in the Sweet 16. It was the Toppers&#x27; eighth all-time appearance in the Sweet 16 but their first since 1993. In 2009, the men&#x27;s basketball team defeated Illinois in the first round of the NCAA Tournament 76–72 to advance to the second-round game against Gonzaga. The Toppers were beaten 83–81 on a last-second shot, failing to advance to their second straight Sweet 16. In the first round of the NCAA Tournament in 2012, the Toppers pulled off a stunning win against Mississippi Valley State, erasing a 16-point deficit with less than five minutes remaining, pulling off a 59–58 win as U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron looked on.

===Football===
The Hilltopper football team belonged to what was then the Gateway Football Conference until 2006. In 2002, WKU won the NCAA Division I FCS (formerly I-AA) National Championship, under coach Jack Harbaugh. In 2006, the school&#x27;s board of regents voted to move the team to the Division I Bowl Subdivision (formerly I-A). After two years of provisional status, they began to compete in 2009 as a member of the Sun Belt Conference. An extensive rivalry with Eastern Kentucky University, known as the Battle of the Bluegrass, ended in 2008 as WKU moved into FBS football. Starting with the 2014 season, WKU football has been a member of Conference USA, following cross-state rivals, Middle Tennessee State University, who joined C-USA a year prior.

==Greek organizations==

In 1965 the Western Kentucky University Board of Regents allowed national fraternities and sororities to form local chapters. Currently, there are some 33 active organizations with approximately 1,500 active undergraduates.

==Media and publications==
*&quot;College Heights Herald&quot;, WKU&#x27;s student-run newspaper since 1924
*&quot;Talisman&quot;, WKU&#x27;s yearbook
*&quot;Rise Over Run Magazine&quot;, WKU&#x27;s online magazine for independent culture

<text>Yōjirō Takita (滝田 洋二郎 &quot;Takita Yōjirō&quot;, born December 4, 1955) is a Japanese filmmaker. Takita received an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for his 2008 drama &quot;Departures&quot;. It marked the first time a Japanese film won the award after the category first became competitive in 1957.

==Career==
Yōjirō Takita entered the film industry through Mukai Productions, where he served as an assistant director. Takita first came to prominence with the long-running, popular light-comic &quot;pink film&quot; series, started by Shin&#x27;ya Yamamoto in 1975, and which Takita began directing in 1982 at Shintōhō Eiga. Later, for the Nikkatsu studio, Takita filmed similar &quot;Molester&#x27;s&quot; films as part of that studio&#x27;s &quot;Roman Porno&quot; line. &quot;Molester&#x27;s School Infirmary&quot; (1984), &quot;Molester&#x27;s Tour Bus&quot; (1985) and &quot;Molester&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot; (1986) are some of these titles. Takita&#x27;s 1986 mainstream comedy, &quot;No More Comic Magazines!&quot; received critical praise, and he has produced several popular films since then. &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; writes that Takita&#x27;s films usually have, &quot;a warm tenderness, reflecting his bright and upbeat personality&quot;.

In 2001, he directed &quot;Onmyoji&quot;, an original work by Baku Yumemakura. It became an international hit and received a prize at The Neuchâtel International Fantastic Film Festival in 2002. He directed &quot;Onmyoji 2&quot; in 2003.

His 2008 film won the Best Foreign Language Film at the U.S. 81st Academy Awards. He also won the 2009 Japan Academy Prize for Director of the Year, among other accolades, for the film.

<text>Fischer&#x27;s chameleon (&quot;Kinyongia fischeri)&quot;, also known commonly as the Nguru blade-horned chameleon and the Nguru two-horned chameleon, is a species of chameleon, a lizard in the family Chamaeleonidae. The species is endemic to Tanzania.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;fischeri&quot;, is in honor of German herpetologist Johann Gustav Fischer.

==Geographic range==
&quot;K. fischeri&quot; is restricted to the Nguru and Nguu Mountains of Tanzania. Chameleons found in other parts of the Eastern Arc Mountains in Tanzania as well as Kenya are now classified as separate species.

==Habitat==
The preferred natural habitat of &quot;K. fischeri&quot; is forest, at altitudes up to .

==Taxonomy==
A number of other species (&quot;K. boehmei&quot;, &quot;K. matschiei&quot;, &quot;K. multituberculata&quot;, &quot;K. tavetana&quot;, &quot;K. uluguruensis&quot;, and &quot;K. vosseleri&quot;) have formerly been included as subpopulations of &quot;K. fischeri&quot; or classified as its subspecies. In 1991, it was recommended that &quot;K. tavetana&quot; (including &quot;K. boehmei&quot;) should be recognized as a species distinct from &quot;K. fischeri&quot;, and in 2008 it was shown that all the remaining also should be recognized as their own, distinct species. This means that the true Fischer&#x27;s chameleon has a far more restricted distribution than previously believed and it does not overlap with the distributions of any of the other species in this group. 

==Reproduction==
&quot;K. fischeri&quot; is oviparous.

==In captivity==
Although formerly considered common in captivity, virtually all &quot;Fischer&#x27;s chameleons&quot; historically exported out of Tanzania were instead its close relatives (especially &quot;K. multituberculata&quot;, but also &quot;K. matschiei&quot; and &quot;K. vosseleri&quot;, and possibly a couple of other species). As of 2013, only three true &quot;K. fischeri&quot; were confirmed to have ever been exported in the captive trade. When watched closely in captivity, it was evident that their nimble footing and rhythmic balance assured the appearance of Crip walking as it sauntered from limb to limb.

<doc id="591348" wikidata="Q7433488" url="?curid=591348" title="National Science Bowl">
<text>The National Science Bowl (NSB) is a high school and middle school science knowledge competition, using a quiz bowl format, held in the United States. A buzzer system similar to those seen on popular television game shows is used to signal an answer. The competition has been organized and sponsored by the United States Department of Energy since its inception in 1991.

==Subject areas==
Questions are asked in the categories of Biology, Chemistry, Earth and Space Science, Energy (dealing with DOE research), Mathematics, and Physics.

Several categories have been added, dropped, or merged throughout the years. Computer Science was dropped from the list in late 2002. Current Events was in the 2005 competition, but did not make a return. General Science was dropped and Astronomy was merged with Earth Science to create Earth and Space Science in 2011.

==Regional competitions==
The winning team of each regional Science Bowl competition is invited to participate in the National Science Bowl finals in Washington, D.C., with all expenses paid. As of 2018, there were 65 high school regionals and 48 middle school regionals. These figures include the two &quot;super regional&quot; sites that are permitted to send two teams to the national competition. The two super regionals are the Kansas/Missouri Regional High School Science Bowl and the Connecticut/Northeast Regional High School Science Bowl (The Northeast Regional includes Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and parts of New York).

Typically, any school that meets the eligibility requirements of the National Science Bowl is permitted to register for its regional competition according to its geographic location. No school may compete in multiple regionals. In addition, most regional competitions permit schools to register up to three teams. Since 2017, club teams are no longer able to compete.

==Rules==
This section first lists the rules for in-person competitions, and finishes with the rules for virtual competitions. The national competition follows all the rules for the in-person competitions. Most in-person regional competitions use the same rules, but they may request to use different rules. Virtual regional competitions must use the rules set for virtual competitions.

===General rules===
A team consists of 4 or 5 students from a single school. Only 4 students play at any one time, while the 5th is designated as the alternate. Substitutions and switching captains may occur at halftime and between rounds.

Two teams compete against each other in each match. Each student is given a designation: A1, A Captain, A2, A3, B1, B Captain, B2, or B3, according to the position they sit in. In regional competitions, each round consists of 23 questions (that is, 23 toss-ups and 23 corresponding bonuses). At the National Finals, each round consists of 25 questions. The match is over when all the toss-up questions have been read (and any bonuses related to correctly answered toss-ups), or after two halves have elapsed, whichever occurs first. The team with the most points at this time is the winner. At the regional level, all matches consist of two 8-minute halves, separated by a 2-minute break. At the national level for middle schools, all matches consist of two 10-minute halves. For high schools, all round robin and some double elimination matches consist of two 10-minute halves, with the final rounds consisting of two 12-minute halves to accommodate the longer visual bonus questions. A toss-up/bonus cycle that is begun before time expires in a half will be finished under the usual rules before the half ends. A question officially begins once its subject area is completely read.

===Toss-ups===
Every match begins with a toss-up question. The moderator announces the subject of the question (see &quot;Subject Areas&quot; above), as well as its type (Multiple Choice or Short Answer). Once the moderator completes the reading of the question, students have 5 seconds to buzz in and give an answer. Students may buzz in at any time after the category has been read—there is no need to wait for the moderator to finish. However, there is a penalty for interrupting the moderator and giving an incorrect answer. After buzzing in, a student must wait for an official to verbally recognize them by saying their designation; otherwise it is considered a blurt, resulting in the answer being ignored and the team being disqualified from answering the toss-up. Upon recognition, the student must give their response within a natural pause (up to 2 seconds); otherwise it is considered a stall and ruled incorrect. If a student buzzes in and answers incorrectly, that student&#x27;s team may not buzz in again on that question, and the opposing team (if still eligible to answer) gets another 5 seconds to buzz in. Quiet nonverbal communication (e.g. in writing or by hand signals) among team members is allowed on toss-ups, but audible communication or mouthing words is not permitted and will disqualify the team from answering the toss-up.

An answer given by a student is ruled correct or incorrect by the moderator. On short answer questions, if the answer given differs from the official one, the moderator uses his or her judgment to make a ruling (which is subject to a challenge by the competitors). On multiple choice questions, students may give the letter answer (W, X, Y, or Z) or the verbal answer. A verbal answer on a multiple choice question is only correct if it matches the official answer &quot;exactly&quot;. However, when the choices are mathematical expressions that would be conventionally written in symbols, common alternate expressions of the answer shall be accepted. For example, “square root of 2” and “square root 2” would both be accepted.

===Bonuses===
If a student answers a toss-up question correctly, that student&#x27;s team receives a bonus question. The bonus question is always in the same category as the corresponding toss-up question, though it may not always relate to the toss-up question. Since only one team has the opportunity to answer the bonus question, there is no need to buzz in to answer it. After the moderator finishes reading the question, the team has 20 seconds to answer. The timekeeper will give a 5-second warning when 5 seconds remain. Conferring between team members is permitted, but the team captain must give the team&#x27;s final answer.

Visual bonuses were introduced in 2003. They are only included in the final elimination rounds. The team has 30 seconds to answer a question with the aid of a visual displayed on a monitor (for the final matches) or on a distributed worksheet (for earlier elimination matches).

The same rules apply to the judging of responses to bonus questions as apply to responses to toss-up questions. Once the team&#x27;s answer has been ruled right or wrong, the moderator proceeds to the next toss-up question.

If neither team answers the toss-up question correctly, the bonus question is not read, and the moderator proceeds to the next toss-up question.

===Scoring===
Correct responses to toss-up questions are worth 4 points each, and correct responses to bonus questions are worth 10 points each.

If a student buzzes in on a toss-up question before the moderator has completely read the question (i.e., interrupts the moderator) and answers &quot;incorrectly&quot; (or a blurt or audible communication from the interrupting team occurs), then 4 points are awarded to the opposing team, and the question is re-read in its entirety so that the opposing team has an opportunity to buzz in. Should the opposing team interrupt during the rereading of the question and subsequently incur a penalty as in the previous rule, then 4 points are added to the first team&#x27;s score, and the moderator proceeds to the next toss-up question.

===Challenges===
Challenges must be made before the moderator begins reading the next question, or 3 seconds after the last question of the half or game. Only the 4 actively competing members may challenge. The fifth team member, coach, and others associated with a team may not become involved in challenges or their discussion. However, beginning in 2020, anyone in the competition room can make the officials aware of scoring or clock management errors, these are known as corrections rather than challenges.

Challenges may be made either to scientific content or the administration of rules. They may not be made to judgment calls by the officials, such as whether a buzz was an interrupt, whether 20 seconds have passed before beginning to answer a bonus, or whether a stall or blurt has happened. Challenges to scientific content are limited to 2 unsuccessful challenges per round. Successful challenges do not count against this limit. Each team has unlimited challenges to administration of rules.

===Rules for Virtual Competitions===
For the 2024 competition, regional competitions have the option of choosing a virtual format. Additionally, the DOE will host 4 virtual nationwide regionals for schools meeting certain criteria.

Teams do not play head-to-head matches in the virtual competition. Instead, each team is placed in their own Zoom room and competing against all the other teams in the tournament. Each competition begins with two or three preliminary rounds, in which the teams&#x27; scores in the rounds are added up, and the teams with the highest totals advance to the elimination rounds. Each regional competition can choose whether to advance 8, 16, 24, or 32 teams to the elimination rounds. During the elimination rounds, only the score for the current round is used to determine the teams advancing to the next round—the scores from the previous rounds are irrelevant. The number of teams left after each elimination round will go in the following order: 24, 16, 8, 4, 2, and finally 1, beginning with the appropriate number based on how many teams initially advanced from the preliminaries.

During each round, the teams are read the same series of 18 toss-up/bonus cycles. There is no game clock. Teams have 7 seconds after the moderator finishes reading for a student to raise their hand and give an answer on a toss-up, and if answered correctly, have 22 seconds after the moderator finishes reading for a student to raise their hand and give an answer on the bonus. If the team misses the toss-up, the bonus is not read. Toss-ups and bonuses may be answered by any of the 4 or 5 team members. Communication of any kind (verbal, via the Zoom chat, or nonverbal) is allowed on both toss-ups and bonuses. There are no penalties for interrupting (but also no reason to interrupt since all the toss-ups would be read in their entirety) or blurting (although the player will be verbally recognized after raising their hand). The rest of the rules, including the point values for toss-ups and bonuses, are the same as the in-person competitions.

==Competition format==
This section is concerned with the format of the national competition only. As is the case with competition rules, the competition format varies greatly among the different regional competitions.

Regionals typically use round robin, single-elimination, double-elimination, or any combination of these formats.

The national competition always consists of two stages: round-robin and double-elimination.

===Round-robin===

All competing teams are randomly arranged (each team captain randomly picks a division and position on the first day of the National Finals) into eight round-robin groups of eight or nine teams each for high school and six teams each for middle school. Every team plays every other team in its group once, receiving 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, or 0 points for a loss. If a team&#x27;s opponent has not arrived, that team can practice instead. The rules still apply, though any win or loss is not counted. In previous years, the top two teams from each group advanced to the double-elimination stage. Starting in 2020, four teams from each group will advance.

====Tiebreaks====
In the event that two or more teams are tied for one of the top spots in a division, the result of the Division Team Challenge (DTC) is used as a tiebreak. This method is only used for high schools.

For middle schools, there are several tiebreak procedures, applied in the following order:
# The head-to-head record of all the tied teams is compared. If this separates a group of two or more teams from the rest of the tied teams, the head-to-head record will be reapplied in the smaller group.
# If the top four teams cannot be determined using head-to head records, the following procedures are used:
#* If more than two teams are still tied, each team is placed in a separate room and is read five toss-up questions. Each team&#x27;s score is determined by the number of questions answered correctly minus the number answered incorrectly. The team(s) with the highest score(s) win(s) the tiebreak.
#* If two teams are still tied, the two teams compete head-to-head, receiving five toss-up questions at 4 points for each correct answer (no bonus questions are used). All the usual toss-up rules are in effect, including the interrupt penalty. The team with the higher score wins the tiebreak.

If a tie still exists after the second step, it is reapplied until the tie is resolved.

===Single/Double-elimination===
Starting in 2020, 32 teams advance to the double elimination stage. Prior to 2020, approximately 16 teams advanced from the round-robin (depending on the number of round robin groups). In 2006, the teams were seeded into a single-elimination tournament based on their preliminary round-robin results. In previous years, a team&#x27;s position in the double-elimination tournament was determined by random draw; teams were not seeded in any way. The competition then proceeded (in 2006) like a typical single-elimination tournament. Seeding continued in the 2007 tournament: teams that won their pool were paired against teams that placed second in theirs. Unlike in the round-robin, a match in double-elimination cannot be tied. If a match is tied at the end of regulation, overtime periods of five toss-ups each are played until the tie is broken.

==Prizes==

The top two high school teams receive trips to one of the National Parks, all-expenses paid.

The top three middle and high school teams receive a trophy, individual medals, and photographs with officials of the Department of Energy.

The top 16 middle and high schools earn a check for their school&#x27;s science departments. As of 2024, the top 16 schools receive $1,000 and the top 2 schools receive $5,000.

Each team with the best Division Team Challenge result in their division earns a $500 check for their school&#x27;s science department.

==Car competition==
For the middle school teams, the DOE also sponsored a car competition challenging competitors to construct a car capable of attaining high speeds. They are powered through alternative energy sources such as hydrogen fuel cells and solar panels. The winners of the car competition were awarded with $500 for their school.

<doc id="591358" wikidata="Q7124488" url="?curid=591358" title="Pah-Ute County, Arizona Territory">
<text>Pah-Ute County is a former county in the northwest corner of Arizona Territory that existed from 1865 until 1871, at which point most of the area was transferred to Nevada. The remainder was merged into Mohave County. The majority of the territory is now in Clark County, Nevada, which includes the city of Las Vegas. Due to the transfer of most of the county&#x27;s land to Nevada, Pah-Ute is sometimes referred to as Arizona&#x27;s &quot;Lost County&quot;. Pah-Ute is a historic spelling of the tribal name Paiute.

==History==
Pah-Ute county was created on December 22, 1865, by an act of the 2nd Arizona Territorial Legislature from the northern part of Mohave County following the sponsorship of Representative Octavius Gass. Created to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population of farmers along the Colorado River, the county seat was initially Callville. The county seat was moved to the Mormon community of St. Thomas on October 1, 1867. (Both communities are now located at the bottom of Lake Mead.) Initial boundaries of the county were those parts of Arizona Territory north of the Roaring Rapids on the Colorado River and west of 113° 20” west longitude.

On May 5, 1866, the United States Congress approved legislation transferring the portions of Pah-Ute and Mohave counties west of the Colorado River and west of 114 degrees west longitude to the state of Nevada. The assignment took effect on January 18, 1867. The Arizona Territory lodged multiple protests with Congress and attempted for several years to have the transfer reversed, but was unable to overturn the change of possession. During this time, Pah-Ute county continued to have representation in the Arizona Territorial Legislature through 1868. Official dissolution of Pah-Ute county occurred on February 18, 1871, when the 6th Arizona Territorial Legislature rescinded the act that created the county and restored the remaining portion to Mohave County.

<text>Dialetheism (; from Greek &#x27;twice&#x27; and &#x27;truth&#x27;) is the view that there are statements that are both true and false. More precisely, it is the belief that there can be a true statement whose negation is also true. Such statements are called &quot;true contradictions&quot;, &quot;dialetheia&quot;, or nondualisms.

Dialetheism is not a system of formal logic; instead, it is a thesis about truth that influences the construction of a formal logic, often based on pre-existing systems. Introducing dialetheism has various consequences, depending on the theory into which it is introduced. A common mistake resulting from this is to reject dialetheism on the basis that, in traditional systems of logic (e.g., classical logic and intuitionistic logic), every statement becomes a theorem if a contradiction is true, trivialising such systems when dialetheism is included as an axiom. Other logical systems, however, do not explode in this manner when contradictions are introduced; such contradiction-tolerant systems are known as paraconsistent logics. Dialetheists who do not want to allow that every statement is true are free to favour these over traditional, explosive logics.

Graham Priest defines dialetheism as the view that there are true contradictions. Jc Beall is another advocate; his position differs from Priest&#x27;s in advocating constructive (methodological) deflationism regarding the truth predicate.

The term was coined by Graham Priest and Richard Sylvan (then Routley).

==Motivations==
===Dialetheism resolves certain paradoxes===
The liar paradox and Russell&#x27;s paradox deal with self-contradictory statements in classical logic and naïve set theory, respectively. Contradictions are problematic in these theories because they cause the theories to explode—if a contradiction is true, then every proposition is true. The classical way to solve this problem is to ban contradictory statements: to revise the axioms of the logic so that self-contradictory statements do not appear (just as with the Russell&#x27;s paradox). Dialetheists, on the other hand, respond to this problem by accepting the contradictions as true. Dialetheism allows for the unrestricted axiom of comprehension in set theory, claiming that any resulting contradiction is a theorem.

However, self-referential paradoxes, such as the Strengthened Liar can be avoided without revising the axioms by abandoning classical logic and accepting more than two truth values with the help of many-valued logic, such as fuzzy logic or Łukasiewicz logic.

===Human reasoning===
Ambiguous situations may cause humans to affirm both a proposition and its negation. For example, if John stands in the doorway to a room, it may seem reasonable both to affirm that &quot;John is in the room&quot; and to affirm that &quot;John is not in the room&quot;.

Critics argue that this merely reflects an ambiguity in our language rather than a dialetheic quality in our thoughts; if we replace the given statement with one that is less ambiguous (such as &quot;John is halfway in the room&quot; or &quot;John is in the doorway&quot;), the contradiction disappears. The statements appeared contradictory only because of a syntactic play; here, the actual meaning of &quot;being in the room&quot; is not the same in both instances, and thus each sentence is not the exact logical negation of the other: therefore, they are not necessarily contradictory.

Moreover, John appears to be standing in a conjunction of two concepts. He is in x and not x at the same time, but not in x and &quot;not in&quot; x at the same time (that would result in a contradiction). He is on his logical connective truth-functional operator, which shows the recurrent ambiguity of human language that often fails to capture the nature of some logical statements.

===Apparent dialetheism in other philosophical doctrines===
The Jain philosophical doctrine of anekantavada—non-one-sidedness—states that all statements are true in some sense and false in another. Some interpret this as saying that dialetheia not only exist but are ubiquitous. Technically, however, a &quot;logical contradiction&quot; is a proposition that is true and false in the &quot;same&quot; sense; a proposition which is true in one sense and false in another does not constitute a logical contradiction. (For example, although in one sense a man cannot both be a &quot;father&quot; and &quot;celibate&quot;—leaving aside such cases as either a celibate man adopting a child or a man fathering a child and only later adopting celibacy—there is no contradiction for a man to be a &quot;spiritual&quot; father and also celibate; the sense of the word father is different here. In another example, although at the same time George W. Bush cannot both be president and not be president, he was president from 2001-2009, but was not president before 2001 or after 2009, so in different times he was both president and not president.)

The Buddhist logic system, named &quot;Catuṣkoṭi&quot;, similarly implies that a statement and its negation may possibly co-exist.

Graham Priest argues in &quot;Beyond the Limits of Thought&quot; that dialetheia arise at the borders of expressibility, in a number of philosophical contexts other than formal semantics.

==Formal consequences==
In classical logics, taking a contradiction formula_1 (see List of logic symbols) as a premise (that is, taking as a premise the truth of both formula_2 and formula_3), allows us to prove any statement formula_4. Indeed, since formula_2 is true, the statement formula_6 is true (by generalization). Taking formula_6 together with formula_3 is a disjunctive syllogism from which we can conclude formula_4. (This is often called the &quot;principle of explosion&quot;, since the truth of a contradiction is imagined to make the number of theorems in a system &quot;explode&quot;.)

==Advantages==
The proponents of dialetheism mainly advocate its ability to avoid problems faced by other more orthodox resolutions as a consequence of their appeals to hierarchies. According to Graham Priest, &quot;the whole point of the dialetheic solution to the semantic paradoxes is to get rid of the distinction between object language and meta-language&quot;. Another possibility is to utilize dialetheism along with a paraconsistent logic to resurrect the program of logicism advocated for by Frege and Russell. This even allows one to prove the truth of otherwise unprovable theorems such as the well-ordering theorem and the falsity of others such as the continuum hypothesis.

There are also dialetheic solutions to the sorites paradox.

==Criticisms==
One criticism of dialetheism is that it fails to capture a crucial feature about negation, known as absoluteness of disagreement.

Imagine John&#x27;s utterance of &quot;P&quot;. Sally&#x27;s typical way of disagreeing with John is a consequent utterance of ¬&quot;P&quot;. Yet, if we accept dialetheism, Sally&#x27;s so uttering does not prevent her from also accepting &quot;P&quot;; after all, &quot;P&quot; may be a dialetheia and therefore it and its negation are both true. The absoluteness of disagreement is lost.

A response is that disagreement can be displayed by uttering &quot;¬&quot;P&quot; and, furthermore, &quot;P&quot; is not a dialetheia&quot;. However, the most obvious codification of &quot;&quot;P&quot; is not a dialetheia&quot; is ¬(&quot;P&quot; formula_10 ¬&quot;P&quot;). But &quot;this itself&quot; could be a dialetheia as well. One dialetheist response is to offer a distinction between assertion and rejection. This distinction might be hashed out in terms of the traditional distinction between logical qualities, or as a distinction between two illocutionary speech acts: assertion and rejection. Another criticism is that dialetheism cannot describe logical consequences, once we believe in the relevance of logical consequences, because of its inability to describe hierarchies.

<text>France 5 () is a French free-to-air public television channel, part of the France Télévisions group. Principally featuring nonfiction and educational programming, the channel&#x27;s motto is &quot;la chaîne de la connaissance et du savoir&quot; (the knowledge network).

In contrast to the group&#x27;s two main channels, France 2 and France 3, France 5 concentrates almost exclusively on factual programming, documentaries, and discussions – 3,925 hours of documentaries were broadcast in 2003 – with fiction confined to one primetime slot of around two hours&#x27; duration on Monday evenings.

France 5 airs 24 hours a day. Earlier – before completion of the switchover to digital broadcasting on 29 November 2011 – the channel&#x27;s analogue frequencies had carried the programmes of the Franco-German cultural channel Arte between 19.00 each evening and 3.00 the following morning.

==History==
It was launched on 28 March 1994 as a temporary channel under the name Télé emploi (Teleworking), more than one year after France&#x27;s first privately owned free television network, La Cinq, suffered a financial collapse and ceased operations on 12 April 1992. La Cinquième started broadcasting on 13 December 1994 with a mix of small educational programs, during the hours not used by Arte (which launched less than 2 months after La Cinq&#x27;s closure).

La Cinquième was integrated in the new France Télévisions public holding in 2000, which gathered Antenne 2 (since renamed France 2) and FR3 (France Régions 3, since renamed France 3); it would be rebranded as France 5 on 1 September 2003. France 5 broadcasting hours have been extended to 24 hours a day, initially available only on cable and satellite, and since spring 2005 on air within the new digital broadcasting multiplex &quot;R1&quot; network that supports all national public TV channels. Analogue transmitters were switched off in 2011.

==Logos==
==Subsidiary==
* La Cinquième Développement – former company, active from 1995 to 2001, wholly owned subsidiary of La Cinquième, responsible for managing telephone services, Minitel, Internet, Teletext, and market a selection of programs of the chain on all media. These services were taken over by France Télévisions subsidiaries at the end of 2000.

<text>Everything, Everything is a live album by Underworld, released 4 September 2000 on Junior Boy&#x27;s Own. The album is named after the lyrics in one of the songs, &quot;Cowgirl&quot;.

A companion DVD was released separately soon after the album&#x27;s release. The DVD features live footage of the band mixed with videography and artistic effects by the design group Tomato, with Jono Griffith of Ernest Edits as &#x27;Creative Editor&#x27;. The DVD also features several songs not on the album – &quot;Moaner&quot;, &quot;Puppies&quot;, &quot;Kittens&quot;, and &quot;Rowla&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Select&quot; gave the album a four out of five rating, stating that &quot;like most live LPs this is ultimately an artefact for fans rather than newcomers, but it&#x27;s quite some artefact&quot;.

<doc id="591370" wikidata="Q4086723" url="?curid=591370" title="Bill, the Galactic Hero">
<text>Bill, the Galactic Hero is a satirical science fiction novel by American writer Harry Harrison, first published in 1965. A novella length version appeared in the magazine &quot; Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1964 under the name &quot;The Starsloggers&quot;.

Harrison reports having been approached by a Vietnam veteran who described Bill as &quot;the only book that&#x27;s true about the military&quot;. Terry Pratchett once said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; was the funniest Science Fiction novel ever written. The funniest Science Fiction novel ever written was &quot;Bill, The Galactic Hero&quot;&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Bill is a farmboy on a small backward agricultural planet who is drugged, hypnotised, then shanghaied into the Space Troopers and sent to recruit training under a fanged instructor named Deathwish Drang. After surviving boot camp, he is transferred to active duty as a fuse tender on the flagship of the space fleet in battle with the Chingers, a small reptilian race who are, in Trooper propaganda, portrayed as being 7 feet tall. Before the battle one of Bill&#x27;s fellow troopers, known as Eager Beager, is revealed to be an android operated from within by a Chinger, who is in fact only 7 inches tall. Injured and with the fleet almost destroyed, Bill accidentally fires off a shot from his ship&#x27;s main gun. The shot is witnessed by an officer and Bill is proclaimed a hero.

As a reward he is sent to the city-planet Helior to receive a medal from the emperor. Bill&#x27;s city plan is stolen from him on a sightseeing tour. Losing his plan is a crime, and without his plan it takes him days to get back to the Trooper Transit Center. When he arrives he finds he is AWOL for missing his transport, and is threatened with arrest and torture. He escapes and flees into the depths of the city, where he first falls in with a gang of similarly &quot;deplanned&quot; outlaws, then finds employment with Helior&#x27;s garbage disposal service, cannily using the galactic postal service to send garbage to other planets, since Helior has run out of room for it. His unwilling recruitment as a spy to infiltrate an ineptly-run anarchist plot leads to his arrest. He has been AWOL for so long that now he is considered a deserter. He avoids being shot by a firing squad thanks to a wily lawyer, who points out that technically the entire city, and therefore the entire planet, is under military rule and is a military base, so he never actually went AWOL. However, he is convicted of sleeping on duty.

He is sent to a prison unit working on a planet where the Human-Chinger war continues. Escaping during an attack, he rescues some prisoners and meets a dying Deathwish Drang. He then shoots off his own foot to get off-planet.

The book ends with the story coming full circle as Bill, with an artificial foot and Deathwish Drang&#x27;s fangs, returns to his home planet and recruits more gullible young men, including his own younger brother, into the Troopers, even after his mother begs him to be merciful. Bill ignores his mother&#x27;s pleas because a recruiter&#x27;s term of service is reduced for each new trooper they enlist.

==Series==
Six sequels were published, from 1989 to 1992:
* The first, &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Robot Slaves&quot; (1989), is by Harry Harrison.

After this, the sequels were penned by other writers and edited by Harrison. Harry Harrison expressed his own disappointment in the series in an interview with Brian Ireland, quoted on Ireland On-Line:
* The second, &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Bottled Brains&quot; (1990), is by Robert Sheckley and Harry Harrison.
* The third, &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Tasteless Pleasure&quot; (1991), is by David Bischoff and Harry Harrison.
* The fourth, &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Zombie Vampires&quot; (1991), is by Jack C. Haldeman and Harry Harrison.
* The fifth, &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of Ten Thousand Bars&quot; (1991), is by David Bischoff and Harry Harrison (was also published under the title: &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero on the Planet of the Hippies from Hell&quot;).
* The sixth, &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero: The Final Incoherent Adventure&quot; (1991), is by David Harris and Harry Harrison.
&quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero&#x27;s Happy Holiday&quot; appeared as a short story in &quot;Galactic Dreams&quot; (1994) by Harry Harrison.

==Plot elements==
===Bloater Drive===
The standard ways of circumventing relativity in 1950s and 1960s science fiction were hyperspace, subspace and spacewarp. Harrison&#x27;s contribution was the &quot;Bloater Drive&quot;. This enlarges the gaps between the atoms of the ship until it spans the distance to the destination, whereupon the atoms are moved back together again, reconstituting the ship at its previous size but in the new location. An occasional side-effect is that the occupants see a planet drifting, in miniature, through the hull.

===Bowb===
Harrison introduced a new euphemism, &quot;bowb&quot;, in the series to cover the vulgarity necessary to render military life accurately. It is used extensively in &quot;Bill, the Galactic Hero&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Topps Comics produced a three-issue adaptation of the first volume in 1994.

Before his death in 2012, Harrison gave filmmaker Alex Cox an &quot;academic license&quot; to make a student film version of the novel with his students at the University of Colorado at Boulder, which Cox and the students completed and released in 2014.

<text>Robert George Harrington (December 3, 1904 – June 15, 1987) was an American astronomer who worked at Palomar Observatory. He should not be confused with Robert Sutton Harrington, who was also an astronomer, but was born later and worked at the US Naval Observatory.

He discovered or co-discovered a number of comets, including periodic comets 43P/Wolf–Harrington, 51P/Harrington (discovered in 1953), 52P/Harrington–Abell (discovered jointly with George Ogden Abell in 1955) and the comet/asteroid 107P/Wilson–Harrington, which he and Albert Wilson discovered in 1949 and which had become an asteroid by 1988.

Harrington discovered the dwarf galaxy Leo II and co-discovered the globular cluster Palomar 12 with Fritz Zwicky.

The asteroid 3216 Harrington was not named after Robert George Harrington, but rather after Robert Sutton Harrington. Harrington&#x27;s name is, however, associated with the asteroid/comet 107P/Wilson–Harrington.

<text>Willem de Sitter (6 May 1872 – 20 November 1934) was a Dutch mathematician, physicist, and astronomer. The De Sitter universe is a cosmological model named after him.

==Life and work==
Born in Sneek, De Sitter studied mathematics at the University of Groningen and then joined the Groningen astronomical laboratory. He worked at the Cape Observatory in South Africa (1897–1899). Then, in 1908, De Sitter was appointed to the chair of astronomy at Leiden University. He was director of the Leiden Observatory from 1919 until his death.

De Sitter made major contributions to the field of physical cosmology. He co-authored a paper with Albert Einstein in 1932 in which they discussed the implications of cosmological data for the curvature of the universe. He also came up with the concept of the De Sitter space and De Sitter universe, a solution for Einstein&#x27;s general relativity in which there is no matter and a positive cosmological constant. This results in an exponentially expanding, empty universe. De Sitter was also well-known for his research on the motions of the moons of Jupiter, invited to give the George Darwin Lecture at the Royal Astronomical Society in 1931.

Willem de Sitter died after a brief illness in November 1934.

==Honours==
In 1912, he became a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Awards==
*James Craig Watson Medal (1929)
*Bruce Medal (1931)
*Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1931)
*Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society (1934)

==Named after him==
*The crater De Sitter on the Moon
*Asteroid 1686 De Sitter
*De Sitter universe
*De Sitter space
*Anti-de Sitter space
*De Sitter invariant special relativity
*Einstein–de Sitter universe
*De Sitter double star experiment
*De Sitter precession
*De Sitter–Schwarzschild metric

==Family==
One of his sons, Ulbo de Sitter (1902 – 1980), was a Dutch geologist, and one of Ulbo&#x27;s sons was a Dutch sociologist Ulbo de Sitter (1930 – 2010).

Another son of Willem, Aernout de Sitter (1905 – 15 September 1944), was the director of the Bosscha Observatory in Lembang, Indonesia (then the Dutch East Indies), where he studied the Messier 4 globular cluster.

<text>An degree is an academic degree awarded by one university or college to an alumnus of another, in a process often known as incorporation. The recipient of the degree is often a faculty member at the institution which awards the degree, e.g. at the University of Cambridge, where incorporation is expressly limited to a person who &quot;has been admitted to a University office or a Headship or a Fellowship (other than an Honorary Fellowship) of a College, or holds a post in the University Press ... or is a Head-elect or designate of a College&quot;.

An degree is not an earned degree.

== History ==
In the later Middle Ages it was common, when a graduate from one university moved into the neighborhood of another, for the new university to admit the graduate as a courtesy, &quot;at the same degree&quot; (in Latin, ). Thus if someone was a Bachelor of Arts in the university that they had attended, they would likewise be a bachelor of arts of their new university. Not every college extended this courtesy to all other colleges, however.

The practice of incorporation diminished in the early 19th century, but it continues at the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and Trinity College Dublin.

== Australia ==
At the University of Sydney, members of the academic staff and general staff who do not hold a degree from the university, &quot;and who have completed a minimum of ten years’ service prior to their retirement may be considered by Senate, on their retirement, for admission ad eundem gradum to an appropriate degree of the University.&quot;

== Ireland ==
A number of female students at Oxford and Cambridge were awarded &quot;ad eundem&quot; University of Dublin degrees at Trinity College Dublin, between 1904 and 1907, at a time when their own universities refused to confer degrees upon women and were nicknamed &quot;steamboat ladies&quot;.

Today, graduates of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are eligible to apply for corresponding degrees of Trinity College Dublin, and vice versa, provided that they wish to register for a degree at Trinity College or are members of the academic staff, and pay the required fee.

== South Africa ==

Rhodes University in South Africa uses the term to give a student status to undertake a research higher degree based on experience, as opposed to an explicit qualification. In this case the student does not acquire a qualification, but is exempt from an entry requirement.

== United Kingdom ==

At the University of Oxford, incorporation first appeared in the University Statutes in 1516, although the practice itself is older: in the 15th and early 16th centuries, incorporation was granted to members of universities from all over Europe. In 1861, incorporation was restricted to members of Cambridge University and Trinity College, Dublin. In 1908, incorporation was further restricted to specific degrees from these universities. While not an earned degree, both original degree(s) and incorporated &quot;ad eundem&quot; degree(s) are given in post-nominals listed in the Oxford University Calendar.

After the foundation of the University of Durham in 1832, Durham made attempts to have its degrees recognised in the &quot;ad eundem&quot; system, introducing the first external examiner system, with all examinations co-marked by an Oxford academic, to assure the other universities that it was maintaining comparable standards. These attempts were rebuffed by the other universities, and eventually abandoned by Durham. Still, Durham granted graduates from other universities degrees &quot;ad eundem&quot; until the practice was abolished by the adoption of new university statutes in 1909.

== United States ==

=== Original use ===
In the United States, the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts as a regularly awarded academic qualification from graduates of other colleges and universities generally dates from the colonial period, and was awarded at the institutions listed below.
=== Contemporary use ===
Five US universities follow a tradition that only alumni may hold certain faculty positions, and in limited cases preserve the tradition of the &quot;ad eundem&quot; Master of Arts to the present day, with the specific circumstances described below.
==== Upon being awarded tenure ====

At Brown and Harvard the degrees are awarded to those faculty who are granted tenure and the rank of associate professor, usually after approximately eight years of service to the university as an assistant professor or for a shorter amount of time for a professor with prior service at another university. Because these degrees do not involve any further study, many faculty members do not list them on their curricula vitae, although some, such as Francesca Gino, choose to do so given the exclusivity of the degree.

At Harvard the degree is described as given &quot;ut in grege nostro numeretur&quot; (&quot;so that (s)he may be numbered in our flock&quot;). During the 1950s, it was noted that the degree were &quot;not announced at Commencement, or included in the printed list of honorary degrees circulated at that time, nor is there any &#x27;citation.&#x27;&quot; Instead, the President of Harvard would present &quot;the diploma at the first meeting of the faculty following the recipient&#x27;s appointment to permanent rank.&quot;

At Brown, the degrees have been awarded as a part of the annual May commencement ceremony.

==== Upon being promoted to full professor ====
At Amherst, Wesleyan, and Yale, the degrees are conferred upon those who rise to the rank of full professor. Yale refers to this degree as the MA &quot;Privatim&quot;. During the 150th anniversary of Princeton University, in 1896, 16 full professors were awarded the MA &quot;Privatim&quot;.

At Amherst, in recent years, the degrees are awarded during first-year student convocation in August, at Yale it is an &quot;elegant, brief ceremony, usual in February or March&quot;, and at Wesleyan as part of commencement in May.

Amherst College grants this degree to college faculty despite the fact that it grants only bachelor&#x27;s degrees to its matriculated students. However, those professors who already earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Amherst or Wesleyan by attending as an undergraduate are not presented with a second degree. In 2024, Amherst College President Michael A. Elliott called this additional rule a &quot;custom, some might say a strange custom.&quot;

==== Posthumous awards ====
In April 2023, the President of Yale, Peter Salovey, awarded M.A. &quot;Privatim&quot; degrees posthumously to Reverend James W. C. Pennington and Reverend Alexander Crummell, the first two black students at Yale, both of whom faced numerous incidents of discrimination and left Yale without earning degrees.

<text>The valve gear of a steam engine is the mechanism that operates the inlet and exhaust valves to admit steam into the cylinder and allow exhaust steam to escape, respectively, at the correct points in the cycle. It can also serve as a reversing gear. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;motion&quot;.

==Purpose==

In the simple case, this can be a relatively simple task as in the internal combustion engine in which the valves always open and close at the same points. This is not the ideal arrangement for a steam engine, though, because greatest power is achieved by keeping the inlet valve open throughout the power stroke (thus having full boiler pressure, minus transmission losses, against the piston throughout the stroke) while peak efficiency is achieved by only having the inlet valve open for a short time and then letting the steam expand in the cylinder (expansive working).

The point at which steam stops being admitted to the cylinder is known as the &quot;cutoff&quot;, and the optimal position for this varies depending on the work being done and the tradeoff desired between power and efficiency. Steam engines are fitted with regulators (throttles in US parlance) to vary the restriction on steam flow, but controlling the power via the cutoff setting is generally preferable since it makes for more efficient use of boiler steam.

A further benefit may be obtained by admitting the steam to the cylinder slightly before front or back dead centre. This advanced admission (also known as &quot;lead steam&quot;) assists in cushioning the inertia of the motion at high speed.

In the internal combustion engine, this task is performed by cams on a camshaft driving poppet valves, but this arrangement is not commonly used with steam engines, partly because achieving variable engine timing using cams is complicated. Instead, a system of eccentrics, cranks and levers is generally used to control a D slide valve or piston valve from the motion. Generally, two simple harmonic motions with different fixed phase angles are added in varying proportions to provide an output motion that is variable in phase and amplitude. A variety of such mechanisms have been devised over the years, with varying success.

Both slide and piston valves have the limitation that intake and exhaust events are fixed in relation to each other and cannot be independently optimised. Lap is provided on steam edges of the valve, so that although the valve stroke reduces as cutoff is advanced, the valve is always fully opened to exhaust. However, as cutoff is shortened, the exhaust events also advance. The exhaust release point occurs earlier in the power stroke and compression earlier in the exhaust stroke. Early release wastes some energy in the steam, and early closure also wastes energy in compressing an otherwise unnecessarily large quantity of steam. Another effect of early cutoff is that the valve is moving quite slowly at the cutoff point, and this creates a constriction point causes the steam to enter the cylinder at less than full boiler pressure (called &#x27;wire drawing&#x27; of the steam, named after the process of making metal wire by drawing it through a hole), another wasteful thermodynamic effect visible on an indicator diagram.

These inefficiencies drove the widespread experimentation in poppet valve gears for locomotives. Intake and exhaust poppet valves could be moved and controlled independently of each other, allowing for better control of the cycle. In the end, not a great number of locomotives were fitted with poppet valves, but they were common in steam cars and lorries, for example virtually all Sentinel lorries, locomotives and railcars used poppet valves. A very late British design, the SR Leader class, used sleeve valves adapted from internal combustion engines, but this class was not a success.

In stationary steam engines, traction engines and marine engine practice, the shortcomings of valves and valve gears were among the factors that lead to compound expansion. In stationary engines trip valves were also extensively used.

== Valve gear designs ==
Valve gear was a fertile field of invention, with probably several hundred variations devised over the years. However, only a small number of these saw any widespread use. They can be divided into those that drove the standard reciprocating valves (whether piston valves or slide valves), those used with poppet valves, and stationary engine trip gears used with semi-rotary Corliss valves or drop valves.

=== Reciprocating valve gears ===

====Early types====
* Slip-eccentric - This gear is now confined to model steam engines, and low power hobby applications such as steam launch engines, ranging to a few horsepower. The eccentric is loose on the crankshaft but there are stops to limit its rotation relative to the crankshaft. Setting the eccentric to the forward running and reverse running positions can be accomplished manually by rotating the eccentric on a stopped engine, or for many engines by simply turning the engine in the desired rotation direction, where the eccentric then positions itself automatically. The engine is pushed forwards to put the eccentric in the forward gear position and backwards to put it in the backward gear position. There is no variable control of cutoff. On the London and North Western Railway, some of the three-cylinder compounds designed by Francis William Webb from 1889 used a slip eccentric to operate the valve of the single low-pressure cylinder. These included the &quot;Teutonic&quot;, &quot;Greater Britain&quot; and &quot;John Hick&quot; classes.
* Gab or hook gear - used on earliest locomotives. Allowed reversing but no control of cutoff.

====Link gears====

===== Constant lead gear (Walschaerts-type gear) =====

One component of the motion comes from a crank or eccentric. The other component comes from a separate source, usually the crosshead.
* Walschaerts valve gear - most common valve gear on later locomotives, normally externally mounted. Also known as Heusinger valve gear.
* Deeley valve gear - fitted to several express locomotives on the Midland Railway. The combination levers were driven, as normal, from the crossheads. Each expansion link was driven from the crosshead on the opposite side of the engine.
* Young valve gear - used the piston rod motion on one side of the locomotive to drive the valve gear on the other side. Similar to the Deeley gear, but with detail differences.
* Baguley valve gear - used by W.G. Bagnall.
* Bagnall-Price valve gear - a variation of Walschaerts used by W.G. Bagnall. This gear is fitted to Bagnall 3023 and 3050, both preserved on the Welsh Highland Railway.
* James Thompson Marshall seems to have designed at least two different modifications of Walschaerts gear.
**One was relatively conventional.
**The other was very complex and drove separate valves on top of the cylinder (for admission) and underneath the cylinder (for exhaust). After the inventor&#x27;s death, this gear was fitted experimentally to Southern Railway N Class locomotive number 1850, the work taking from 16 October 1933 to 3 February 1934; but it failed on 22 March 1934. Since the inventor was unable to modify the design, the valve gear was replaced by standard Walschaerts gear between 24 March and 11 April 1934.
* Isaacson&#x27;s patent valve gear - a modified Walschaerts gear, patented in 1907 by Rupert John Isaacson, and others, patent no. GB190727899, published 13 August 1908. It was fitted to the Garstang and Knot-End Railway&#x27;s 2-6-0T &quot;Blackpool&quot; (built 1909) and to Midland Railway No. 382 during 1910–11. Isaacson also has a patent (GB126203, published 8 May 1919) for an improved sight-feed lubricator. This was patented jointly with his representative, Ysabel Hart Cox.
* Kingan-Ripken valve gear. This is a Walschaerts-type gear in which the combination lever is linked to an arm on the connecting rod, near its small end, instead of to the crosshead. Patented in Canada by James B. Kingan and Hugo F. Ripken, patent CA 204805, issued 12 October 1920. This gear was fitted to some locomotives of the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway (&quot;Soo Line&quot;); Hugo Ripken worked as a foreman in the Soo Line&#x27;s Shoreham Shops in Minneapolis.

===== Dual eccentric gear (Stephenson-type gears)=====

Two eccentrics joined by a curved or straight link. A simple arrangement which works well at low speed. At high speed, a Walschaerts-type gear is said to give better steam distribution and higher efficiency.
* Stephenson valve gear - most common valve gear in the 19th century, normally inside the locomotive frame.
* William T. James valve gear 1832, used first by Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, United States.
* Allan valve gear, a straight-link valve gear. It is fitted to 0-4-0WT &quot;Dolgoch&quot;, preserved on the Talyllyn Railway.
* Gooch valve gear

==== Lever and link gear (Baker-type) ====

* Baker valve gear - fairly common in the United States, it had no sliding parts.

====Radial gears====
Both components of the motion come from a single crank or eccentric. A problem with this arrangement (when applied to locomotives) is that one of the components of the motion is affected by the rise and fall of the locomotive on its springs. This probably explains why radial gears were largely superseded by Walschaerts-type gears in railway practice but continued to be used in traction and marine engines.
* Hackworth valve gear invented by John Wesley Hackworth in 1859.
* Joy valve gear - a design used extensively on the L&amp;YR and LNWR in England, and elsewhere. A preserved example is LNWR G2a Class number 49395.
* Marshall valve gear - a modified Hackworth gear, patented in 1879 by Marshall, Sons &amp; Co. A modern application is to the miniature locomotive &quot;Badger&quot;.
* Brown valve gear - Invented by Charles Brown (1827-1905) who was the father of Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown. This gear was used by Corpet-Louvet and Duffield Bank Railway.
* Southern valve gear - Briefly popular in the United States around 1920. It had elements of the Baker patterns, but dispensed with the combination lever of the Walschaerts.

=== Poppet valve gears ===
* Caprotti valve gear, British Caprotti valve gear
* Hugo Lentz, oscillating-cam valve gear, rotary-cam valve gear
* Franklin oscillating-cam valve gear
* Franklin rotary-cam valve gear
* Reidinger valve gear

===Conjugating gears===

These enable a 3-cylinder or 4-cylinder locomotive to be built with only two sets of valve gear. The best known is Gresley conjugated valve gear, used on 3-cylinder locomotives. Walschaerts gear is usually used for the two outside cylinders. Two levers connected to the outside cylinder valve rods drive the valve for the inside cylinder. Harold Holcroft devised a different method for conjugating valve gear by linking the middle cylinder to the combination lever assembly of an outside cylinder, creating the Holcroft valve gear derivative. On a 4-cylinder locomotive the arrangement is simpler. The valve gear may be inside or outside and only short rocking-shafts are needed to link the valves on the inside and outside cylinders.

===Bulleid chain-driven valve gear===
:&quot;See Bulleid chain-driven valve gear&quot;

=== Corliss valve gear ===
:&quot;See Corliss steam engine&quot;
Large stationary engines often used an advanced form of valve gear developed by George Henry Corliss, usually called Corliss valve gear. This gear used separate valves for inlet and exhaust so that the inlet cut-off could be controlled precisely. The use of separate valves and port passages for steam admission and exhaust significantly also reduced losses associated with cylinder condensation and re-evaporation. These features resulted in much improved efficiency.

==Controls for valve gear==
A locomotive&#x27;s direction of travel and cut-off are set from the cab by using a reversing lever or screw reverser actuating a rod reaching to the valve gear proper. Some larger steam engines employ a power reverse, which is a servo mechanism, usually powered by steam. This makes control of the reversing gear easier for the driver.

<text>Charles Fisher (15 or 16 August September 1808 – 8 December 1880) was a politician and jurist of New Brunswick, Canada. Fisher was a leading Reformer of his day who headed the first responsible government in New Brunswick from 1854 to 1861.

== Early life ==
Charles Fisher was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, on either 16 August – 16 September 1808, to parents Peter Fisher and Susanna Williams.

== Career ==
Fisher was first elected to the colonial assembly in 1837, serving from 1848 to 1850. During this time, Fisher wrote to his friend Joseph Howe about the evil ways of the family compact and on the irresponsible nature of the government and its politics. Fisher would become Leader of the Official Opposition and then Premier and Attorney General in 1854. His government implemented various reforms in education, administration and the electoral system. His government lost power in 1856 when it tried to implement Prohibition which proved unpopular with voters but he returned to power in 1857. His leadership ended in 1861 when he was ousted by fellow reformer Samuel L. Tilley due to a scandal over the leasing of crown lands.

Charles Fisher became a Father of Confederation, participating in the Quebec Conference of 1864 and the London Conference of 1866 that drafted the British North America Act.

He was elected to the House of Commons in 1867 as a Liberal but resigned his seat in 1868 to accept an appointment to the New Brunswick Supreme Court. One of his notable decisions as a judge of the Court was his lone dissent in &quot;Dow v Black&quot;, a significant constitutional law case dealing with the federal-provincial division of powers. He would have upheld the constitutionality of a provincial statute dealing with municipal taxation, but the majority of the Court held the statute to be unconstitutional. However, his position was upheld on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, at that time the court of last resort for the British Empire, which ruled that the statute was within provincial powers. In another case, &quot;Ex parte Renaud&quot;, he concurred in the Court&#x27;s decision upholding the constitutionality of the Common Schools Act of 1871. That decision was also upheld by the Judicial Committee, in &quot;Maher v Town Council of Portland&quot;.

He declined an appointment to be Chief Justice of New Brunswick, remaining a puisne judge until his death at the age of 72. He was buried in the Forest Hill Cemetery in Fredericton, York County, New Brunswick, Canada.

His daughter, Jane M. Paulette Fisher, married future premier John James Fraser.

<doc id="591387" wikidata="Q5085894" url="?curid=591387" title="Charlotte County, Province of New York">
<text>Charlotte County was a county in the colonial Province of New York in the British American colonies. It was created from Albany County on March 24, 1772. The county was named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of George III of the United Kingdom. Its boundaries extended far further than any current county. Its western boundary ran from the northern boundary of Albany County to the Canada line, at a point near the old village of St. Regis. Its southern boundary was what is now the northern boundary of Saratoga County. Much of western Vermont, then claimed by New York, was also part of the county. Its northern border was also the Canada–US border. Its county seat was Fort Edward.

In 1777, the Vermont Republic claimed the eastern section of Charlotte County, in what is currently Vermont. This claim was largely ignored by New York&#x27;s new state legislature, which voted on April 2, 1784, to change the name of all of Charlotte County to Washington County, NY, in honor of George Washington, stating, “From and after the passing of this act, the county of Tryon shall be called and known by the name of Montgomery, and the county of Charlotte by the name of Washington.” In 1791, Vermont became a state, taking that section of Charlotte County. In 1799 Clinton County was created from part of Washington County. Clinton County itself was partitioned to form other upstate counties. The Town of Cambridge was transferred in 1791 from Albany County to Washington County.

<doc id="591394" wikidata="Q60190" url="?curid=591394" title="Principle of explosion">
<text>In classical logic, intuitionistic logic, and similar logical systems, the principle of explosion is the law according to which any statement can be proven from a contradiction. That is, from a contradiction, any proposition (including its negation) can be inferred; this is known as deductive explosion.

The proof of this principle was first given by 12th-century French philosopher William of Soissons. Due to the principle of explosion, the existence of a contradiction (inconsistency) in a formal axiomatic system is disastrous; since any statement can be proven, it trivializes the concepts of truth and falsity. Around the turn of the 20th century, the discovery of contradictions such as Russell&#x27;s paradox at the foundations of mathematics thus threatened the entire structure of mathematics. Mathematicians such as Gottlob Frege, Ernst Zermelo, Abraham Fraenkel, and Thoralf Skolem put much effort into revising set theory to eliminate these contradictions, resulting in the modern Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.

As a demonstration of the principle, consider two contradictory statements—&quot;All lemons are yellow&quot; and &quot;Not all lemons are yellow&quot;—and suppose that both are true. If that is the case, anything can be proven, e.g., the assertion that &quot;unicorns exist&quot;, by using the following argument:
# We know that &quot;Not all lemons are yellow&quot;, as it has been assumed to be true.
# We know that &quot;All lemons are yellow&quot;, as it has been assumed to be true.
# Therefore, the two-part statement &quot;All lemons are yellow &quot;or&quot; unicorns exist&quot; must also be true, since the first part of the statement (&quot;All lemons are yellow&quot;) has already been assumed, and the use of &quot;or&quot; means that if even one part of the statement is true, the statement as a whole must be true as well.
# However, since we also know that &quot;Not all lemons are yellow&quot; (as this has been assumed), the first part is false, and hence the second part must be true to ensure the two-part statement to be true, i.e., unicorns exist (this inference is known as the Disjunctive syllogism).
# The procedure may be repeated to prove that unicorns do &quot;not&quot; exist (hence proving an additional contradiction where unicorns do and do not exist), as well as any other well-formed formula. Thus, there is an &quot;explosion&quot; of true statements. 

In a different solution to the problems posed by the principle of explosion, some mathematicians have devised alternative theories of logic called &quot;paraconsistent logics&quot;, which allow some contradictory statements to be proven without affecting the truth value of (all) other statements. 

==Symbolic representation==
In symbolic logic, the principle of explosion can be expressed schematically in the following way:
== Proof ==

Below is the Lewis argument, a formal proof of the principle of explosion using symbolic logic.


This proof was published by C. I. Lewis and is named after him, though versions of it were known to medieval logicians.

This is just the symbolic version of the informal argument given in the introduction, with formula_1 standing for &quot;all lemons are yellow&quot; and formula_2 standing for &quot;Unicorns exist&quot;. We start out by assuming that (1) all lemons are yellow and that (2) not all lemons are yellow. From the proposition that all lemons are yellow, we infer that (3) either all lemons are yellow or unicorns exist. But then from this and the fact that not all lemons are yellow, we infer that (4) unicorns exist by disjunctive syllogism.

===Semantic argument===
An alternate argument for the principle stems from model theory. A sentence formula_1 is a &quot;semantic consequence&quot; of a set of sentences formula_4 only if every model of formula_4 is a model of formula_1. However, there is no model of the contradictory set formula_7. A fortiori, there is no model of formula_7 that is not a model of formula_2. Thus, vacuously, every model of formula_7 is a model of formula_2. Thus formula_2 is a semantic consequence of formula_7.

==Paraconsistent logic==

Paraconsistent logics have been developed that allow for subcontrary-forming operators. Model-theoretic paraconsistent logicians often deny the assumption that there can be no model of formula_14 and devise semantical systems in which there are such models. Alternatively, they reject the idea that propositions can be classified as true or false. Proof-theoretic paraconsistent logics usually deny the validity of one of the steps necessary for deriving an explosion, typically including disjunctive syllogism, disjunction introduction, and &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;.

==Usage==
The metamathematical value of the principle of explosion is that for any logical system where this principle holds, any derived theory which proves ⊥ (or an equivalent form, formula_15) is worthless because &quot;all&quot; its statements would become theorems, making it impossible to distinguish truth from falsehood. That is to say, the principle of explosion is an argument for the law of non-contradiction in classical logic, because without it all truth statements become meaningless. 

Reduction in proof strength of logics without the principle of explosion are discussed in minimal logic.

*Volker Epperlein

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 96% based on 26 critics, with an average rating of 8/10. On Metacritic, &quot;Karl Marx City&quot; has an above average score of 73 out of a 100 based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

A.O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the documentary &quot;unsettling&quot; and added that &quot;[it] is a smart, highly personal addition to the growing syllabus of distressingly relevant cautionary political tales&quot;.

Scott Tobias of &quot;Variety&quot; has compared the film&#x27;s atmosphere to the one of today.

Stephen Dalton of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, following the film&#x27;s screening at Toronto International Film Festival, wrote: &quot;a key joy of &quot;Karl Marx City&quot; is its strong, arty aesthetic&quot;.

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Jake Cole said that the lead heroine (Petra Epperlein), &quot;[who have] personal ties to the subject matter[,] provides the documentary with a necessary anchor point&quot;.

Ella Taylor of NPR wrote that &quot;[the film] suffers now and then from the same breathy tendency to overdramatize already incendiary material that marred Epperlein and Tucker&#x27;s 2005 Iraq doc[umentary] &quot;Gunner Palace&quot;.

<text>The NLnet Foundation supports organizations and people that contribute to an open information society. It was influential in spreading the Internet throughout Europe in the 1980s. In 1997, the foundation sold off its commercial networking operations to UUNET (now part of Verizon), resulting in an endowment with which it makes grants.

NLnet is known for sponsoring open source software and standards work as well as auxiliary activities. Some of the projects that NLnet supports or has supported are DNSSEC, the ODF plugfest, the GPL V3 license drafting process, Tor anonymity network, the Parrot virtual machine, Namecoin, Jitsi, nftables, and Libre-SOC.

== History ==
NLnet&#x27;s history started in April 1982 with the announcement by Teus Hagen as chairman of a major initiative by the European Unix Users Group (EUUG) to develop and provide network services in Europe under the name EUnet. NLnet was the main node of the EUnet operating out of the Netherlands national center for mathematics and computer science CWI, and played a vital role in spreading first UUCP and later the ARPAnet throughout Europe, earning Hagen and other pioneers a place in the Internet Hall of Fame. NLnet also pioneered the world&#x27;s first dial-in and ISDN infrastructure with full country coverage by using the signal wiring from the Netherlands rail system owned by Nederlandse Spoorwegen. NLnet was one of the founders of the AMS-ix foundation and the .nl registry SIDN.

Stichting NLnet was formally established as a &quot;Stichting&quot; (Dutch for foundation) in February 1989. In November 1994 Stichting NLnet created NLnet BV (a Dutch Limited liability corporation or BV) as a commercial operating subsidiary and so incorporated the first Internet service provider in The Netherlands. In 1997 the Internet provision services company was acquired by UUnet, which had just become a subsidiary of MFS. MFS was acquired shortly thereafter by Worldcom, which then initiated a takeover bid on MCI and later became a subsidiary of Verizon.

The acquisition provided Stichting NLnet with an endowment to transform into a grant-making organization, funding the development of Internet network technology and associated Computer Sciences research and development. The foundation is a recognized public benefit organization (in Dutch ANBI) and runs an open call where anyone in the world can submit proposals to improve the Internet, as well as several thematic funds such as the Internet Hardening Fund. Results are made freely available to the community in the broadest sense, typically under FOSS licenses and through Internet standards, web standards and the like.

In 1999, NLNet founded NLnet Labs, a network research laboratory in Amsterdam. NLNet Labs develops DNS-related software, such as NSD, Unbound, OpenDNSSEC and getDNS.

<text>Compact governments or compacts were the conservative colonial cliques that ruled colonies, particularly in British North America prior to the granting of responsible government. They were usually Tory in orientation and representative of the local elite. Compacts exercised their influence through unelected Legislative Councils in the era when governments were formed by appointment of the Lieutenant-Governor and did not rely on the confidence of the elected House of Assembly.

Examples include the Family Compact that had influence over Upper Canada and Lower Canada&#x27;s Château Clique, though similar compacts held sway in pre-Confederation New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

<text>Robert Sutton Harrington (October 21, 1942 – January 23, 1993) was an American astronomer who worked at the United States Naval Observatory (USNO). Harrington was born near Newport News, Virginia. His father was an archaeologist. He was married to Betty-Jean Maycock in 1976, with two daughters, Amy and Ann.

Harrington worked at the USNO. Another astronomer there, James W. Christy, consulted with him after discovering bulges in the images of Pluto, which turned out to be Pluto&#x27;s satellite Charon. For this reason, some consider Harrington to be a co-discoverer of Charon, although Christy usually gets sole credit. By the laws of physics, it is easy to determine the mass of a binary system based on its orbital period, so Harrington was the first to calculate the mass of the Pluto-Charon system, which was lower than even the lowest previous estimates of Pluto&#x27;s mass.

For much of his career, he proposed the existence of a Planet X beyond Pluto and supported searches for it, collaborating initially with T. C. (Tom) Van Flandern.

Harrington died of esophageal cancer in 1993. The asteroid 3216 Harrington was named in his honour.

== Disproof of existence of Planet X ==

Six months before Harrington&#x27;s death, E. Myles Standish had used data from &quot;Voyager 2&quot;&#x27;s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet&#x27;s total mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune&#x27;s newly determined mass was used in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; that can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System. Although most astronomers agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist, as of January 2016 there is speculation concerning Planet Nine.

<text>Keemun () is a famous Chinese black tea. First produced in the late 19th century, it quickly became popular in the West and is still used for a number of classic blends (such as Earl Grey tea). It is a light tea with characteristic stone fruit and slightly smoky notes in the aroma and a gentle, malty, non-astringent taste reminiscent of unsweetened cocoa. Keemun is said to have floral aromas and wooden notes.

==History==
Original Keemun is produced exclusively in the Qimen County in the south of Anhui province. It is grown in Guichi, Shitai, Dongzhi, and Yixian. The name of the tea is an older Western spelling of the name of the nearby town, Qimen (pronounced &quot;Chee-mun&quot;). The tea-growing region lies between the Yellow Mountains and the Yangtze River. The cultivar used for Keemun is the same as that used in production of Huangshan Maofeng. While the latter is an old, well-known variety of green tea, Keemun was first produced in 1875 using techniques adapted from Fujian province farmers.

Many varieties of Keemun exist, with different production techniques used for each. Nevertheless, any Keemun undergoes particularly slow withering and oxidation processes, yielding more nuanced aroma and flavor. Some of Keemun&#x27;s characteristic floral notes can be attributed to a higher proportion of geraniol, compared to other black teas.

==Varieties==
Among the many varieties of Keemun perhaps the most well-known is &quot;Keemun Mao Feng&quot; (). Harvested earlier than others, and containing leafsets of two leaves and a bud, it is lighter and sweeter than other Keemun teas. Another high grade variety, containing mostly leaves and stronger than others, is the &quot;Keemun Hao Ya&quot; (). For Western markets, it is separated by quality into Hao Ya A and Hao Ya B categories, the former being somewhat better than the latter. Either has a markedly intense taste. Other varieties include those specifically tailored for the Gongfu tea preparation method (&quot;Keemun Gongfu&quot;, or &quot;Congou&quot; – ) and &quot;Keemun Xin Ya&quot; (), an early bud variety, said to have less bitterness. One of the black teas produced in neighboring Hubei province is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Hubei Keemun&quot; () by several tea companies, but is not a Keemun in the true sense of the term.

<text>Henry Wheeler Shaw (April 21, 1818October 14, 1885), better known by the pen name Josh Billings, was a 19th-century American humorist and lecturer.

==Biography==
Shaw was born in Lanesborough, Massachusetts on April 21, 1818. His father was Henry Shaw, who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1817 to 1821, and his grandfather Samuel Shaw who also served in the U.S. Congress from 1808 to 1813. His uncle was John Savage, yet another Congressman.
Shaw attended Hamilton College, but was expelled in his second year for removing the clapper of the campus bell. He married Zipha E. Bradford in 1845.

Shaw worked as a farmer, coal miner, explorer, and auctioneer before he began making a living as a journalist and writer in Poughkeepsie, New York, in 1858. Under the pseudonym &quot;Josh Billings&quot; he wrote in an informal voice full of the slang of the day, with often eccentric phonetic spelling, dispensing wit and folksy common-sense wisdom. His books include &quot;Farmers&#x27; Allminax&quot;, &quot;Josh Billings&#x27; Sayings&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Friend&quot;, &quot;Choice Bits of American Wit&quot; and &quot;Josh Billings&#x27; Trump Kards&quot;.
He toured, giving lectures of his writings, which were very popular with the audiences of the day. He was also reputed to be the eponymous author of the &quot;Uncle Ezek&#x27;s Wisdom&quot; column in the Century Magazine.

Billings died in Monterey, California, on October 14, 1885. Billings&#x27; death is described in Chapter 12 of John Steinbeck&#x27;s fictional &quot;Cannery Row&quot;. According to Steinbeck&#x27;s homage, Billings died in the Hotel del Monte in Monterey after which his body was delivered for burial preparation by the local constable to the town&#x27;s only doctor, who also doubled as an amateur mortician. The doctor, per his usual embalming protocol, dispensed of Billings&#x27; entrails by tossing them into the gulch behind his house before packing the torso with sawdust. The stomach, liver and intestines were found in the gulch the following morning by a dog whose master, a small boy, intended on using them for fish bait. Some local men, realizing the disgrace this could bring to Monterey—a town proud of its literary heritage—were able to stop the boy as he was preparing to row out to sea, retrieved the &quot;tripas&quot; and forced the doctor to give Billings&#x27; organs a proper burial befitting a great author.

Billings&#x27; daughter Grace Shaw Duff donated money for the building of Wilhenford Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, which opened in 1910. The name combined a syllable of her father&#x27;s&#x27; name (Hen) with her husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s.

==Legacy and attributed quotations==

His saying, &quot;In the whole history of the world there is but one thing that money can not buy... to wit the wag of a dog&#x27;s tail&quot; appears at the beginning of the Disney film &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;.

The phrase, &quot;Love is like measles... the later in life it occurs, the tougher it gets,&quot; was quoted as being Josh Billings&#x27; in Jan Karon&#x27;s book, &quot;A Light in the Window&quot;.

While the Squeaky Wheel aphorism was used in different forms before Billings, his poem, &quot;The Kicker&quot; brought the idiom into common usage of American language. The term &quot;kicker&quot; at the time in the 1800s was another term for a complainer. The poem is:

&quot;Consider the postage stamp, son. It secures success through its ability to stick to one thing till it gets there.&quot;

&quot;Solitude is a good place to visit, but a poor place to stay.&quot;

&quot;I honestly believe it iz better tew know nothing than tew know what ain&#x27;t so.&quot; Another variation: &quot;It is better to know less than to know so much that ain&#x27;t so.&quot;

&quot;The old miser who has accumulated his millions, and sits down on them afterwards, reminds me of a fly that has fallen into a barrel of molasses&quot;.

&quot;If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant. If we did not sometimes taste adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome.&quot;

Although some news sources, such as Grammarist and numismatic sources cite Josh Billings as the origin for the term &quot;joshing,&quot; this is incorrect. As noted by author Joshua D Glawson, the term &quot;joshing&quot; has been documented as early as 1835, as well as 1845, 1875, 1878, 1887, 1891, and 1898 with no reference to Josh Billings or the character Josh Tatum. The name Josh was a part of the character choice by Henry Wheeler Shaw, to be an average man on the side of imbecilic.

The Hong Kong movie &quot;&quot; ends with his quote &quot;There is no revenge so complete as forgiveness.&quot;

<doc id="591455" wikidata="Q715013" url="?curid=591455" title="Tales from the Crypt (TV series)">
<text>Tales from the Crypt, sometimes titled HBO&#x27;s Tales from the Crypt, is an American horror anthology television series created by William Gaines and Steven Dodd that ran for seven seasons on the premium cable channel HBO, from June 10, 1989, to July 19, 1996, with a total of 93 episodes. The show&#x27;s title is based on the 1950s EC Comics series of the same name, published by William Gaines and edited by Al Feldstein. Despite the show&#x27;s title, episodes were not only adapted from stories from &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, but also other EC Comic series including &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, &quot;Crime SuspenStories&quot;, &quot;Shock SuspenStories&quot;, and &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot;.

The series is hosted by the Cryptkeeper, a wisecracking corpse performed by several puppeteers and voiced by John Kassir. Filmmakers Richard Donner, David Giler, Walter Hill, Joel Silver, and Robert Zemeckis formed the show&#x27;s team of executive producers.

Because it was aired on HBO, a premium cable television channel, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; did not have to be censored by the standards and practices of most networks. As a result, HBO allowed the series to include content that had not appeared in most television series up to that time, such as graphic violence, profanity, sexual activity, and nudity. Reruns of the series were edited for basic cable, broadcast syndication, and when the broadcast networks Fox and CBS re-aired episodes in the late 1990s. While the series began production in the United States, the final season was primarily filmed in the United Kingdom, resulting in episodes revolving around British characters.

==Format==

Each episode begins with a tracking shot leading to the front door of the decrepit mansion of the Cryptkeeper, the show&#x27;s host. Once inside, the camera tilts down from the foyer to the hallways and stairways, finally descending into the basement. The Cryptkeeper then comes out from his coffin, cackling wildly. Green slime pours down over the screen as the main title appears. The Cryptkeeper is depicted as an animated corpse, as opposed to the original comics in which he was a living human being. 

The wisecracking Cryptkeeper, performed by a team of puppeteers such as Van Snowden, Mike Elizalde, Frank Charles Lutkus, Patty Maloney, David Arthur Nelson, Anton Rupprecht, Shaun Smith, David Stinnent, Mike Trcic, and Brock Winkless, and voiced by John Kassir, then introduced the episode with intentionally stereotyped jokes and mostly puns, &quot;e.g.&quot;, his frequent greeting to viewers: &quot;Hello, Boils and Ghouls&quot; or &quot;Hello, Kiddies&quot;. Each episode was self-contained, and was bookended by an outro sequence, again involving the Cryptkeeper. Comic book cover art was created by Mike Vosburg and Shawn McManus.

==Spin-offs==
The success of the series led Universal Pictures to make a three picture deal with the Crypt Partners to produce three Crypt-branded feature films.

===Films===
The first Crypt-branded feature was &quot;Tales from the Crypt Presents: Demon Knight&quot; (1995). Directed by Ernest Dickerson from a screenplay by Ethan Reiff, Cyrus Vorhis and Mark Bishop, it became a commercial success. Three weeks before starting prep on &quot;Demon Knight&quot; intended follow up –a psychological thriller called &quot;Dead Easy&quot;–, Universal changed its mind, canceled &quot;Dead Easy&quot; and had the creative team make &quot;Tales from the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood&quot; instead.

The film &quot;Ritual&quot; (2002) was not produced as a &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; film, but is considered to be a third entry in the &quot;Tales&quot; series.

===&quot;Tales from the Cryptkeeper&quot;===

In 1993, a Saturday morning cartoon called &quot;Tales from the Cryptkeeper&quot; was spun off from the HBO series. Produced by the Canada-based Nelvana for ABC in the United States and YTV in Canada, the violence of the prime-time series was substantially toned down and the gore was omitted. Nelvana employed a child psychologist to review the scripts to ensure the episodes would be suitable for young viewers. The Cryptkeeper puppet was considered as the host for the series, but it was ultimately decided that it might frighten youngsters, so instead an animated version was created. John Kassir reprised his role. 

Kassir later stated &quot;Nelvana created a kinder, gentler personality for the children&#x27;s Cryptkeeper, and it feels a little uncharacteristic at times&quot;. In addition to the Cryptkeeper, EC Comics&#x27; mascots The Vaultkeeper and The Old Witch made frequent appearances, often fighting with the Cryptkeeper for control of the show&#x27;s hosting duties. The series lasted three seasons on ABC with 39 episodes. The third season was on CBS in 1999, with 13 episodes, under the title &quot;New Tales from the Cryptkeeper&quot;.

===&quot;Secrets of the Cryptkeeper&#x27;s Haunted House&quot;===

A kids&#x27; game show called &quot;Secrets of the Cryptkeeper&#x27;s Haunted House&quot; was featured on CBS from 1996 to 1997. The Cryptkeeper, again voiced by John Kassir, was the announcer of the show. He would often break into the action with wisecracks, and contestants competed in physical challenges on a variety of elaborate haunted house sets at Universal Studios Florida. In addition to The Cryptkeeper, the series showed off an original character named Digger the Skeleton, voiced by Danny Mann.

===Radio series===

In 2000, several &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; &quot;radio shows&quot; were recorded for Seeing Ear Theatre, an online subsidiary of The Sci-Fi Channel, and were offered free as streaming RealAudio files on their website, as well as for sale on Audible.com. Although 13 episodes were planned, with forthcoming episodes listed as &quot;TBA&quot;, only eight stories were recorded. Seven of the eight shows were released on CD in 2002 by Highbridge Audio &quot;This Trick&#x27;ll Kill You&quot; was omitted from the CD set.

===&quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot;===
In 1991, the Fox television network aired a pilot for &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot;, a spin-off based on the 1950s EC action comics. When Fox passed on the pilot, Cryptkeeper segments were put down onto the three stories, &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Showdown&quot;, and &quot;King of the Road&quot;, and HBO ran them as &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; episodes.

===&quot;Perversions of Science&quot;===

After the original series ended, a spin-off called &quot;Perversions of Science&quot; premiered in June 1997 on HBO, this time being based more on sci-fi instead of horror. The series was unsuccessful and lasted for a short run, ending only a month after it had begun airing. This iteration of the franchise featured a stylized female robot host in place of The Cryptkeeper.

==Notable guest stars==
A variety of notable guests have starred in episodes of &quot;Tales from the Crypt.&quot; These include Academy Awards-winning actors, A-list celebrities and highly recognizable character actors.

Some of the most famous people to have starred in episodes are listed below:
==Albums==
===Soundtrack===
In 1991, Big Screen Records released a soundtrack album featuring assorted music from the series. The album includes the theme music, suites from 11 episodes and an original song titled &quot;Crypt Jam&quot; performed by The Cryptkeeper, John Kassir. A music video for &quot;Crypt Jam&quot; was filmed and is available as an extra on the Region 1 Season 3 DVD.

===Have Yourself a Scary Little Christmas===
In 1994, a Christmas album, &quot;Have Yourself a Scary Little Christmas&quot;, was released by The Right Stuff, a subsidiary of Capitol Records. Most of the songs are spoofs of holiday standards performed by The Cryptkeeper, such as &quot;Juggle Bills&quot; (&quot;Jingle Bells&quot;), &quot;We Wish You&#x27;d Bury the Missus&quot; (&quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot;) and &quot;Deck the Halls with Parts of Charlie&quot; (&quot;Deck the Halls&quot;), with narration and a few original songs mixed in. The CD booklet includes a black and white reprint of the comic &quot;And All Through the House&quot;.

===Monsters of Metal===
In 2000, Capitol Records released another album titled &quot;Tales from the Crypt: Monsters of Metal&quot;. This album is a compilation of horror-themed songs from popular heavy metal bands with wraparound narration by the Cryptkeeper (John Kassir).

==Home media==
Warner Home Video has released all seven seasons on DVD Region 1. The DVDs for the first three seasons feature all-new Cryptkeeper introductions and segments. No new segments were filmed for seasons 4–7. In June 2017, all seven seasons were reissued in a box set entitled &quot;Tales from the Crypt: The Complete Series&quot;. A Region 2 version of the whole series was released by &#x27;84 Entertainment in June 2010.

Until mid-2020, the series was available through the streaming platform Vudu.
==Reruns==
Reruns aired on Fox from 1994 to 1995 under the name &quot;Primetime Tales from the Crypt&quot;; episodes also aired in 1994 in a late-night time slot. It aired late night on CBS in 1997–1998. It also aired on other channels, such as Syfy, Chiller, and Fearnet.

In the United Kingdom, the series aired Fridays on ITV. Sky1 Satellite and cable channel Horror Channel, then Zone Horror, aired the series in both late night and daytime slots. The daytime versions were billed as &quot;cut&quot;. However, they remained uncut.

&quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; is not available on Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s streaming service Max reportedly due to licensing issues. It was also unavailable on HBO Go and HBO Now for the same reason.

==Revival attempts==

In July 2011, it was announced that Gilbert Adler, who produced the original series, was working with Andrew Cosby to develop a new &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; series. It was said to be a continuous story, rather than an anthology, and would omit The Cryptkeeper. The series was unsuccessfully shopped to several major networks.

In January 2016, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reported that M. Night Shyamalan would helm a series reboot as part of TNT&#x27;s new two-hour horror block. The network ordered a 10-episode season that was slated for fall 2017. The series was to keep the episodic anthology format, but without The Cryptkeeper. In June 2017, it was announced that TNT would not move forward with the series due to legal issues concerning the rights for the characters from Tales from the Crypt Holdings.

<text>John Patrick Doyle AM (born 1953) is an Australian actor, writer, radio presenter and comedian best known for his character Rampaging Roy Slaven.

==Early life and education==
Doyle was born in Lithgow, New South Wales in 1953 into a music-loving, Catholic household with three sisters, Deanna, Cathy, and Jen, and a brother, Tony. His mother was a business woman and his father a railway fettler. He was an altar boy for a time but lost interest in Catholicism with the introduction of contemporary changes in the mass, among other things. 

He attended and was a prefect at De La Salle Academy in Lithgow before graduating from the then Newcastle Teachers&#x27; College in 1973 with a Diploma of Teaching (Secondary English/History). He completed a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Newcastle (NSW) in 1978 before joining the Hunter Valley Theatre Company. Doyle continued to perform while teaching at Glendale High School near Newcastle. After seven years of teaching, he moved to Sydney, where he worked with the Sydney Theatre Company.

==Career==
===Radio===
Doyle began his radio career in 1985 when his character &quot;Rampaging&quot; Roy Slaven appeared on Triple J&#x27;s breakfast show every Friday. Loosely based on classic TV sporting commentators such as Rex Mossop, Doyle created Slaven as a larger-than-life persona, an utterly opinionated, impossibly talented &quot;sporting everyman&quot; who has represented Australia in every field, won innumerable Melbourne Cups on his ageless mount Rooting King, is on intimate terms with every sporting celebrity (including many top racehorses), as well as film and music stars, politicians and other leaders of society around the world, yet who retains the &quot;common touch&quot; and stands for Australian manhood, fairness, and honesty. Slaven is the name of a well known family from Doyle&#x27;s home town, Lithgow. During that time, he met Flinders University arts graduate and comedian Greig Pickhaver when they worked together as minor characters on the SBS children&#x27;s series &quot;Five Times Dizzy&quot;. Pickhaver had similar comedic skills and interests, and had also developed a sporting commentator character called HG Nelson while appearing on the Melbourne radio comedy program &quot;Punter to Punter&quot; in the early &#x27;80s. An amalgam of just about every Aussie sports commentator and race caller who ever lived, HG, like Roy, has seen and done it all and is utterly passionate about truth and honesty in sport.

The team of &quot;Roy and HG&quot; was born when &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; premiered on Triple J in early 1986. The four-hour (later three-hour) comedy show, improvised live, soon became a cult hit. Over that time Doyle and Pickhaver perfected a unique style that satirises the world of sport and the athletes, the entertainment scene and celebrity in general, in a manner that is simultaneously ruthless and affectionate. As well as their weekly radio show, the duo also made satirical radio &quot;calls&quot; of major annual sporting events including the State of Origin series, the NRL and AFL Grand Finals (known as the Festivals of the Boot, Parts I and II) and the Melbourne Cup, as well as occasional outside broadcasts of TSL performed before live audiences.

In addition to &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;, Doyle hosted the two-hour mid-afternoon shift on ABC radio station 2BL in Sydney for several years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, earning a loyal following among listeners and demonstrating that he was not only extremely knowledgeable on a huge range of subjects, but was also a superb interviewer. He took over many existing program segments and made them entirely his own, and his regular conversations with guests such as cooking expert Barbara Lowery, Sydney Opera House media liaison officer &quot;Commodore&quot; David Brown (whom he nicknamed &quot;The Salty Sea Dog&quot;), gardening expert Angus Stewart (nicknamed &quot;The Doctor Of The Dirt&quot;), pop music expert and &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; journalist Bruce Elder (nicknamed &quot;The Professor of Pop&quot;) and &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; TV Guide editor Tony Squires, became regular highlights of the show.

Like Graham Kennedy, Doyle specialised in subtly (or blatantly) undercutting the &quot;straight&quot; presentation of such stock segments, and he often veered off on tangents that he found funny or diverting, or introduced ideas which he thought might be likely to get a &quot;rise&quot; from his guest. One memorable thread was his long-running obsession with the source of a supposed &quot;mystery noise&quot; that was reputedly disturbing patrons in the Opera House Concert Hall, and he regularly badgered long-suffering Opera House publicist David Brown for an explanation. The inadequacy of the women&#x27;s toilets were also a frequent subject of discussion, or more correctly, interrogation, and the &quot;what&#x27;s on at the Opera House&quot; segments stretched from around 10 minutes to a whole half-hour, through most of which David Brown&#x27;s characteristic laugh was a highlight.

Although his &quot;Slavenesque&quot; sense of humour often showed through on the 2BL shift, Doyle and Pickhaver were assiduous about keeping their real-life identities and the Roy and HG characters separate (they were rarely photographed) and although Pickhaver often appeared on &quot;The Afternoon Programme&quot; as HG Nelson, Doyle never performed overtly as Roy, or referred to him in any way. During this period Doyle kept up a hectic work schedule, presenting &quot;The Afternoon Programme&quot; two hours a day, Monday to Friday, as well as his regular four-hour stint on Saturdays on &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; and also, at one stage, the first weekly half-hour TV version of the show.

&quot;This Sporting Life&quot; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry in 2013.

In March 2020, Doyle and Pickhaver reprised their roles as Roy Slaven and HG Nelson for their weekly show &quot;Bludging on the Blindside&quot;.

===Television===
In 1984, Doyle appeared as English bowler George &quot;Gubby&quot; Allen in the acclaimed Network Ten television miniseries &quot;Bodyline&quot;.

In the early 1990s, &quot;Roy and HG&quot; successfully transferred to ABC-TV; the first version, also called &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;, was moderately successful, but suffered from being essentially a TV &quot;talking head&quot; version of the radio show. They reinvented the concept by marrying it with a broad parody-cum-tribute of Australian variety entertainment. The result, &quot;Club Buggery&quot; ran for two series (one as &quot;The Channel Nine Show&quot;); it became a cult hit, and the duo won a Logie Award.

After moving to the commercial Seven Network in the late 1990s, they scored record TV ratings and gained international notoriety during the Sydney 2000 Olympics with their hit late-night Olympic commentary show &quot;The Dream&quot;. The show became so popular that the Australian Olympic Committee included the duo in the Closing Ceremony. They have also appeared on the Seven Network with &quot;The Monday Dump&quot; and &quot; The Nation Dumps&quot; and have repeated their success with &quot;The Dream&quot; in two subsequent series commentating on the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and the 2004 Olympics in Athens. The two have also appeared together on the television shows &quot;The Channel Nine Show&quot; and &quot;Planet Norwich&quot;.

Over the last decade Doyle has also developed a very successful parallel career as a writer of serious television drama. His first major effort as a TV dramatist was the highly acclaimed ABC-TV miniseries &quot;Changi&quot;, an adventurous exploration of the experiences of a group of young Australian soldiers interned in Changi POW camp during World War II. The series was partly inspired by &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; and was originally conceived as a situation comedy; using the dramatic technique of magic realism, Doyle developed the script into a deeply moving yet often humorous examination of the experiences of young men at war and the effects it has on their later lives.

In 2003, he completed the drama series &quot;Marking Time&quot;, which examines contemporary racial and cultural tensions in Australian society, seen through the prism of an Australian country town and focusing on the relationship between two teenagers — an Anglo Celtic Australian boy named Hal and an Afghan refugee Muslim girl named Randa.

In 2006, Doyle appeared in &quot;Two Men In A Tinnie&quot;, a documentary of his own making involving a trip down the Murray-Darling river system of Australia with his longtime friend, biologist Dr. Tim Flannery. The program focuses on the degradation of the once mighty rivers and gives many different insights as to the causes. John and Tim reprised their collaboration in 2008 with &quot;Two In The Top End&quot; where they explored northern Australia and subsequently in 2012 with &quot;Two On The Great Divide&quot; where they travelled along the 3500 km long Great Dividing Range, and in 2014 with &quot;Two Men in China&quot;.

In 2013, he released &quot;Building Australia&quot;, a miniseries exploring the architecture and history of houses in Australia.

===Theatre===
In 2008, his play &quot;Pig Iron People&quot; was produced by Sydney Theatre Company at the Sydney Opera House Drama Theatre. Another play written by John Doyle, &quot;Vere (Faith)&quot;, produced by Sydney Theatre Company and the State Theatre Company of South Australia, was shown in October and November 2013.

==Personal life==
Doyle met his wife Deanna, a visual artist, while working with the Hunter Valley Theatre Company, though they both graduated from the Newcastle Teachers&#x27; College in 1973. The couple lives in the Sydney suburb of Balmain.

Doyle is the Patron of Autism Spectrum Australia; with his affiliation brought about as a result of his younger sister Jen being diagnosed with autism when she was ten. Doyle&#x27;s late father suffered from dementia, which inspired his play &quot;Vere (Faith)&quot;. Both of Doyle&#x27;s parents died in 2012 and his sister Jen died in early 2020. 

==Honours==
Doyle&#x27;s outstanding contribution to Australia&#x27;s cultural scene, through theatre, radio and television was recognised with the granting of an honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Newcastle in 2001. He delivered the 2005 Andrew Olle Media Lecture. He has also presented the AWGIE Awards a number of times, including in 2012 and 2015 as himself and in 2002 with Pickhaver as Rampaging Roy Slaven and HG Nelson.

Doyle became a Member of the Order of Australia on 14 June 2010 for service to the media as a presenter and entertainer, and as a supporter of a range of charitable organisations, particularly the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund in Australia.

<text>Gordon Greig Pickhaver (born 10 February 1948) is an Australian actor, comedian and writer, who forms one half of the satirical sports comedy duo &quot;Roy and HG&quot; as the excitable sports announcer HG Nelson. The award-winning duo teamed up in 1986 for the Triple J radio comedy program &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;, and were broadcast nationwide for 22 years, leading to several successful television spinoffs.

==Personal life ==
Pickhaver was born at Walwa private hospital, Myrtle Bank, South Australia, to parents Gordon Samuel Pickhaver, and Beryl Marion Rebecca Pickhaver née Skuce. His father was a World War II veteran who saw action in the Middle East and on the Kokoda Track and whose career was in the South Australian dairy industry. Pickhaver has three sisters (Jane, Anne and Mary) and a brother, Mark. Pickhaver lived on Morphett Road, Warradale, South Australia up to the age of 15, and then the family moved to the suburb of Prospect, where he lived until the age of 22. He attended Oaklands Park Primary school, Brighton Secondary School, and for the last two years of high school Adelaide High School. He graduated from Flinders University and describes himself as dyslexic, having always relied heavily on memory and recall to achieve any academic results.

==Radio career==
Pickhaver performed in plays at school and at university. After a stint as a roadie for Australian rocker Billy Thorpe in the early 1970s, he became involved in the Melbourne theatre co-operative The Pram Factory. He moved into radio broadcasting on 3RRR in Melbourne and developed the HG Nelson character while performing in the Melbourne radio sports comedy show &quot;Punter To Punter&quot; in the early 1980s.

Pickhaver met John Doyle in 1985 while both were playing minor characters in an SBS TV show, and they teamed up as Roy (aka Rampaging Roy Slaven) and HG in 1986. Their radio comedy program &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; was broadcast initially in Sydney and later nationally on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Triple J youth radio network. It was continuously on-air for a 22-year period till 2008. &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry in 2013. Since March 2020, the Roy and HG characters have broadcast &#x27;Bludging on the Blindside&#x27;, on ABC radio on Saturdays through the football season, a sports program whose main focus is both celebrating and lampooning the culture and business of rugby league in Australia.

==Television and film career ==
With John Doyle as &quot;Rampaging Roy Slaven&quot;, Pickhaver has appeared on television shows such as &quot;The Dream with Roy and HG&quot;, &quot;This Sporting Life&quot;, &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot;, &quot;Club Buggery&quot;, &quot;The Channel Nine Show&quot;, &quot;Planet Norwich&quot;, &quot;Win Roy and HG&#x27;s Money&quot;, &quot;The Monday Dump&quot;, &quot;The Nation Dumps&quot;, &quot;The Ice Dream with Roy and HG&quot;, &quot;The Cream&quot;, &quot;The Dream in Athens&quot;, &quot;The Memphis Trousers Half Hour&quot;, and &quot;Roy and HG&#x27;s Russian Revolution&quot;.

Pickhaver hosted &quot;It&#x27;s a Knockout&quot; from 2011 to 2012 alongside former Hi-5 star Charli Robinson and sports presenter Brad McEwan. Pickhaver joined Stephen Quartermain and Alisa Camplin for the &quot;Sochi Tonight&quot; show during the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in February 2014, and was featured in the SBS series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in September 2015. Many of his television opportunities have been &quot;alternative&quot; sports presentation coverages of the Summer or Winter Olympics.

Pickhaver starred in the cult 1993 Australian comedy film &quot;This Won&#x27;t Hurt a Bit&quot; opposite Jacqueline McKenzie. In 2003, he appeared in the political comedy &quot;The Honourable Wally Norman&quot;.

<text>Moisture is the presence of a liquid, especially water, often in trace amounts. Moisture is defined as water in the adsorbed or absorbed phase. Small amounts of water may be found, for example, in the air (humidity), in foods, and in some commercial products. Moisture also refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air. The soil also includes moisture.

== Moisture control in products ==
Control of moisture in products can be a vital part of the process of the product. There is a substantial amount of moisture in what seems to be dry matter. Ranging in products from cornflake cereals to washing powders, moisture can play an important role in the final quality of the product. There are two main aspects of concern in moisture control in products: allowing too much moisture or too little of it. For example, adding some water to cornflake cereal, which is sold by weight, reduces costs and prevents it from tasting too dry, but adding too much water can affect the crunchiness of the cereal and the freshness because water content contributes to bacteria growth. Water content of some foods is also manipulated to reduce the number of calories.

Moisture has different effects on different products, influencing the final quality of the product. Wood pellets, for instance, are made by taking remainders of wood and grinding them to make compact pellets, which are sold as a fuel. They need to have a relatively low water content for combustion efficiency. The more moisture that is allowed in the pellet, the more smoke that will be released when the pellet is burned.

The need to measure water content of products has given rise to a new area of science, aquametry. There are many ways to measure moisture in products, such as different wave measurement (light and audio), electromagnetic fields, capacitive methods, and the more traditional weighing and drying technique.

<doc id="591474" wikidata="Q7373546" url="?curid=591474" title="Roy and HG">
<text>Roy and HG are an Australian comedy duo, comprising Greig Pickhaver in the role of &quot;H. G. Nelson&quot; and John Doyle as &quot;&#x27;Rampaging&#x27; Roy Slaven&quot;. Their act is an affectionate but irreverent parody of Australia&#x27;s obsession with sport. Their characters are based on stereotypes in sports journalism: Nelson the excitable announcer, and Slaven the retired sportsman turned expert commentator. In his 1996 book &quot;Petrol, Bait, Ammo &amp; Ice&quot;, Pickhaver summarised the duo&#x27;s comedic style as &quot;making the serious trivial and the trivial serious&quot;.

The duo&#x27;s long-running triple j radio program &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry in 2013, and the &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; 30th anniversary retrospective collection won the ARIA Award for Best Comedy Release in 2016.

Since March 2020, Roy and HG&#x27;s weekly show &quot;Bludging on the Blindside&quot; airs on Saturday afternoons on ABC Sport, ABC Local Radio, the ABC Listen app, as well as podcast platforms.

It was reported in July 2021 that Roy &amp; HG would host Dodging Armageddon, a daily podcast for ABC Radio with an Olympics theme, which was broadcast throughout the XXXII Olympiad’s competitions.

==Radio==
=== triple j ===
Doyle and Pickhaver wrote and hosted the live, improvised, and satirical radio program &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; on triple J from 1986 to 2008. They also broadcast annual live commentaries of the NRL and AFL Grand Finals (dubbed the &quot;Festival of the Boot, Parts I and II&quot;) and the Melbourne Cup. Commentaries for all three matches of rugby league&#x27;s annual State of Origin series are also broadcast (&quot;main article: Roy and HG&#x27;s State of Origin commentary&quot;), and they have also broadcast live commentaries of other major events, including the Bicentennial celebrations on 26 January 1988 and the 2007 Australian federal election (&quot;Indecision 07&quot;). They also provided a half-hour coverage of the 2008 Beijing Olympics every weekday under the guise of the &quot;Golden Ring Show&quot;.

At conclusion, &#x27;This Sporting Life&#x27; held the record as the longest-running program in the history of triple j.

=== Triple M ===
Starting 12 January 2009, the duo presented the drive-time program &quot;The Life&quot; on the Triple M network, on Mondays and Fridays. In 2011, &#x27;The Life&#x27; show was cut to Fridays only, with the last episode broadcast on 25 November 2011. &#x27;Roy &amp; HG&#x27;s Mardi Gras of Medals&#x27; – their coverage of the Rio Olympic Games – was broadcast on Triple M in August 2016.

A weekly program, &#x27;The Sporting Probe with Roy &amp; HG&#x27; commenced broadcast in January 2017 and ran for two years until December 2018. The show aired from 10:00 am to midday on Saturday in 2017, and in the same timeslot on Sunday in 2018. All episodes are available as a podcast.

=== Macquarie Sports Radio ===
In 2019, Roy and HG presented &quot;Just Short of a Length&quot; on the Macquarie Sports Radio network. Nine Radio have not renewed programming contacts for 2020 and beyond with Roy and HG after dropping the unpopular Macquarie Sports Radio branded talk format and returning to a music format for their Sydney 2UE, Melbourne 3EE aka Magic 1278, and Brisbane 4BH assets. All three stations reverting to their original historical station ID call signs.

=== ABC Radio ===
Between 2012 and 2016, Roy and HG resumed their &quot;Festival Of The Boot&quot; AFL and NRL grand final commentaries on ABC NewsRadio.

In March 2020, Roy and HG returned to ABC Sport to present a new weekly Saturday afternoon show entitled &quot;Bludging on the Blindside&quot;. The show is broadcast on ABC Sport digital radio and the ABC Listen app, and broadcast on ABC Local Radio in NSW, ACT and QLD. All episodes are available on podcast platforms and the ABC listen app soon after initial broadcast.

In July 2021, it was announced that Roy and HG will be presenting a daily Olympic games podcast for ABC Radio, entitled &#x27;Dodging Armageddon&#x27;.

In July 2024, it was announced that Roy and HG would be presenting a show titled &quot;People, Medals and Cheese&quot; on ABC Local Radio on weekdays and RN in the afternoon and on the ABC Listen app for the Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games.

==Television==
=== ABC ===
After several years on radio, Roy and HG transferred the radio show&#x27;s format to a series of ABC television shows, including &quot;Blah Blah Blah&quot; (1988) (where they were only seen in silhouette), &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1993–94), the Logie award-winning &quot;Club Buggery&quot; (1995–97) and its successor &quot;The Channel Nine Show&quot; (1998), &quot;Planet Norwich&quot; (1998; made in the UK) and &quot;The Memphis Trousers Half Hour&quot; (2005; taped in Sydney but performed as if broadcast from the United States).

=== UK ===
In 1997, the duo were in an ad campaign for Foster&#x27;s Lager in the United Kingdom that had the tagline &quot;Tickle it, you wrigglers!&quot;. They were recurring guests on the 1998 BBC One TV comedy series The Ben Elton Show.

=== Seven Network ===
After transferring to the commercial Seven Network in the late 1990s, they presented &quot;Win Roy &amp; H.G.&#x27;s Money&quot; (2000), an unsuccessful adaptation of the US hit &quot;Win Ben Stein&#x27;s Money&quot;. They later succeeded with higher-rating shows &quot;The Monday Dump&quot; and &quot;The Nation Dumps&quot;.

Their biggest hit was their top-rating commentary-interview television program &quot;The Dream with Roy and HG&quot; (from the Sydney 2000 Olympics), featuring their own special outlook on the event. &quot;The Dream&quot; was followed by three spinoffs – &quot;The Ice Dream&quot; (from the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics), &quot;The Cream&quot; (from the 2003 Rugby World Cup), and &quot;The Dream&quot; again for the Athens 2004 Olympics. During the Ice Dream they launched a bid for the Winter Olympics to be held at Smiggin Holes, in the humorous Smiggin Holes 2010 Winter Olympic bid with suggested slogans &quot;Unleash the Mighty Mongrel&quot;, &quot;Winter Wonder Down Under&quot; and &quot;If you&#x27;ve got the poles, we&#x27;ve got the holes.&quot; &quot;Dream&quot;-style coverage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, called the &quot;Dribble mit HG und Roy&quot;, was streamed via the Internet.

Roy and H.G.&#x27;s sport shows were filmed in front of a live studio audience, segments including discussion between the two characters, interview with athletic guests and pre-recorded sports commentary. The humour of the duo&#x27;s sports commentary came from their mock-serious tone which belied the innuendo and invented terminology that they used to describe the on-screen action. The pair would state fictitious &quot;facts&quot; about the competitors&#x27; occupations, histories and personalities. Roy &amp; H.G. would also describe fictitious aspects of the competition venues, such as the so-called &quot;Gobbler&#x27;s Gulch&quot; section of the Salt Lake City luge track.

Roy and HG were not selected by Channel Seven to cover the Beijing Olympics because of security concerns and the belief by Channel Seven management that the style of their coverage – going to air live following a day&#x27;s events – would not have suited Australian audiences given Australia&#x27;s time zones. Instead, a daily radio programme, &quot;The Golden Ring Show&quot;, was broadcast on triple j, with Roy styled as &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; and H.G. as &quot;the Hidden Dragon&quot;.

=== &quot;The Memphis Trousers Half Hour&quot; ===
In 2005, they presented &quot;The Memphis Trousers Half Hour&quot;, a TV show they claimed was recorded in different American cities such as Baltimore or Albuquerque, ensuring that &#x27;Australia is the flavour of the month, every month&#x27;. The show screened weekly on the ABC on Saturday nights and was named after an incident in which former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser lost his trousers in a Memphis hotel.

The show, seemingly filmed in the United States, was in fact filmed entirely in Sydney. The format was a parody of American talk shows and pretended to present Americans with new &#x27;facts&#x27; about Australia.

=== Network Ten ===
Roy and HG joined Network Ten for their Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics coverage, where they hosted a commentary show called Roy and HG&#x27;s Russian Revolution. HG Nelson also joined Stephen Quartermain and Alisa Camplin for the Sochi Tonight daily show.

The narrow-gauge Kalka-Shimla railway passes through Solan. Located on the Punjab-Himachal Border, Solan is nestled in the Shivalik hills of the Himalayas.

Solan was originally the capital of the princely state, Baghat. A defining feature of Solan, is its ancient temples and monasteries. The Shoolini Mata Temple and Jatoli Shiv Temple are popular attractions for tourists. One of the most famous monasteries in this region is the Yundung Monastery. The hill-town is named after the Hindu goddess Shoolini Devi ~ who is a manifestation of Goddess Durga in Her warrior aspect. Shoolini, when translated literally, means &#x27;the goddess wielding the spear&#x27;. Every year in June, a fair venerating the Goddess is held, featuring a 3-day melā at the central Thodo ground.

Solan is known for the production of quality mushrooms, as a result of the vast mushroom farming in the area, as well as the Directorate of Mushroom Research (DMR) situated at Chambaghat.

<doc id="591482" wikidata="Q4826608" url="?curid=591482" title="Automatic transmission system">
<text>An automatic transmission system (ATS) is an automated system designed to keep a broadcast radio or television station&#x27;s transmitter and antenna system running without direct human oversight or attention for long periods. Such systems are occasionally referred to as &quot;automated transmission systems&quot; to avoid confusion with the automatic transmission of an automobile.

==History==
Traditionally, radio and television stations were required to have a licensed operator, technician or electrical engineer available to tend to a transmitter at all times it was operating or capable of operating. Any condition (such as distorted or off-frequency transmission) that could interfere with other broadcast services would require immediate manual intervention to correct the fault or take the transmitter off the air. Facilities also had to be monitored for any fault conditions which could impair the transmitted signal or cause damage to the transmitting equipment.

Because broadcast transmitters were often at a different location from the broadcast studios, attended operation required an operator to be physically located at the transmitter site. In the 1950s and 1960s, remote control systems were introduced to allow an operator at the studio to power the transmitter on or off. At the same time, an early remote control system, the Automon, was developed by RCA engineers in Montréal that included a relay system that automatically detected if the transmitter was operating outside of its allowed parameters. The Automon could send the studio an alarm if the transmitter was out of tolerance and, if contact to the studio was lost, it could automatically power down the transmitter. A similar system was developed in 1953 by Paul Schafer in California, using a rotary telephone to raise or lower transmitter parameters remotely.

As technology improved, transmitters became more reliable, and electromechanical means of checking and later correcting problems became commonplace. Regulations eventually caught up with these advances, to allow of unattended operation via an ATS. During the 1970s, the BBC made widespread use of automated systems on its UHF television network to switch from main to standby transmitters in the case of a fault, as well as to alert engineering staff to problems. In 1977, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission loosened operation rules to allow stations in the United States with ATSes to automatically monitor transmitter operation and allow the ATS to automatically adjust modulation or shutdown the transmitter if operation was out of tolerance, although the specific rules have continued to evolve with changes to the Emergency Alert System and the introduction of digital radio.

==Theory of operation==
An ATS monitors conditions such as voltage, current, and temperature within the transmitter cabinet or enclosure, and often has external sensors as well, particularly on the antenna. Some systems have remote monitoring points which report back to the main unit through telemetry links.

Advanced systems can monitor and often correct other problems which are considered mission-critical, such as detecting ice on antenna elements or radomes and turning on heaters to prevent the VSWR (power reflected from a mismatched antenna back into the transmitter) from going too high. High-power stations that use desiccation pumps to put dry nitrogen into their feedline (to displace moisture for increased efficiency) can also monitor the pressure. Generators, batteries, and incoming electricity can also be monitored.

If anything goes wrong which the ATS cannot handle, it can send out calls for help, via pager, telephone voice message, or dedicated telemetry links back to a fixed point such as a broadcast studio. Other than possibly listening for dead air from the studio/transmitter link, an ATS does &quot;not&quot; cover the programming or the studio equipment like broadcast automation, but rather only the &quot;transmitter plant&quot;.

An ATS can also be used to automate scheduled tasks, such as lowering an AM radio station&#x27;s transmission power at sundown and raising it at sunrise to meeting license requirements for different propagation patterns at day and night.

<doc id="591492" wikidata="Q1049496" url="?curid=591492" title="Complementary good">
<text>In economics, a complementary good is a good whose appeal increases with the popularity of its . Technically, it displays a negative cross elasticity of demand and that demand for it increases when the price of another good decreases. If formula_1 is a complement to formula_2, an increase in the price of formula_1 will result in a negative movement along the demand curve of formula_1 and cause the demand curve for formula_2 to shift inward; less of each good will be demanded. Conversely, a decrease in the price of formula_1 will result in a positive movement along the demand curve of formula_1 and cause the demand curve of formula_2 to shift outward; more of each good will be demanded. This is in contrast to a substitute good, whose demand decreases when its substitute&#x27;s price decreases.

When two goods are complements, they experience &quot;joint demand&quot; - the demand of one good is linked to the demand for another good. Therefore, if a higher quantity is demanded of one good, a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. For example, the demand for razor blades may depend on the number of razors in use; this is why razors have sometimes been sold as loss leaders, to increase demand for the associated blades. Another example is that sometimes a toothbrush is packaged free with toothpaste. The toothbrush is a complement to the toothpaste; the cost of producing a toothbrush may be higher than toothpaste, but its sales depends on the demand of toothpaste.

All non-complementary goods can be considered substitutes. If formula_9 and formula_10 are rough complements in an everyday sense, then consumers are willing to pay more for each marginal unit of good formula_9 as they accumulate more formula_10. The opposite is true for substitutes: the consumer is willing to pay less for each marginal unit of good &quot;formula_13&quot; as it accumulates more of good &quot;formula_10&quot;.

Complementarity may be driven by psychological processes in which the consumption of one good (e.g., cola) stimulates demand for its complements (e.g., a cheeseburger). Consumption of a food or beverage activates a goal to consume its complements: foods that consumers believe would taste better together. Drinking cola increases consumers&#x27; willingness to pay for a cheeseburger. This effect appears to be contingent on consumer perceptions of these relationships rather than their sensory properties.

==Examples==
An example of this would be the demand for cars and petrol. The supply and demand for cars is represented by the figure, with the initial demand formula_15. Suppose that the initial price of cars is represented by formula_16 with a quantity demanded of formula_17. If the price of petrol were to decrease by some amount, this would result in a higher quantity of cars demanded. This higher quantity demanded would cause the demand curve to shift rightward to a new position formula_18. Assuming a constant supply curve formula_19 of cars, the new increased quantity demanded will be at formula_20 with a new increased price formula_21. Other examples include automobiles and fuel, mobile phones and cellular service, printer and cartridge, among others.

==Perfect complement==

A &quot;perfect complement&quot; is a good that &quot;must&quot; be consumed with another good. The indifference curve of a perfect complement exhibits a right angle, as illustrated by the figure. Such preferences can be represented by a Leontief utility function.

Few goods behave as perfect complements. One example is a left shoe and a right; shoes are naturally sold in pairs, and the ratio between sales of left and right shoes will never shift noticeably from 1:1.

The degree of complementarity, however, does not have to be mutual; it can be measured by the cross price elasticity of demand. In the case of video games, a specific video game (the complement good) has to be consumed with a video game console (the base good). It does not work the other way: a video game console does not have to be consumed with that game.

=== Example ===
In marketing, complementary goods give additional market power to the producer. It allows vendor lock-in by increasing switching costs. A few types of pricing strategy exist for a complementary good and its base good:

*Pricing the base good at a relatively low price - this approach allows easy entry by consumers (e.g. low-price consumer printer vs. high-price cartridge)
*Pricing the base good at a relatively high price to the complementary good - this approach creates a barrier to entry and exit (e.g., a costly car vs inexpensive gas)

==Gross complements==
Sometimes the complement-relationship between two goods is not intuitive and must be verified by inspecting the cross-elasticity of demand using market data.

Mosak&#x27;s definition states &quot;a good formula_9 is a gross complement of formula_10 if formula_24 is negative, where formula_25 for formula_26 denotes the ordinary individual demand for a certain good.&quot; In fact, in Mosak&#x27;s case, formula_9 is not a gross complement of formula_10 but formula_10 is a gross complement of formula_9. The elasticity does not need to be symmetrical. Thus, formula_10 is a gross complement of formula_9 while formula_9 can simultaneously be a gross substitutes for formula_10.

===Proof===
The standard Hicks decomposition of the effect on the ordinary demand for a good formula_9 of a simple price change in a good formula_10, utility level formula_37 and chosen bundle formula_38 is

formula_39

If formula_9 is a gross substitute for formula_10, the left-hand side of the equation and the first term of right-hand side are positive. By the symmetry of Mosak&#x27;s perspective, evaluating the equation with respect to formula_42, the first term of right-hand side stays the same while some extreme cases exist where formula_42 is large enough to make the whole right-hand-side negative. In this case, formula_10 is a gross complement of formula_9. Overall, formula_9 and formula_10 are not symmetrical.

<text>Carl Alvar Wirtanen (November 11, 1910 – March 7, 1990) was an American astronomer and discoverer of comets and minor planets who worked at Lick Observatory. He was of Finnish ancestry.

Wirtanen was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin. After visiting the observatory in Kenosha with his violin teacher at age 12, he started grinding mirrors. Wirtanen joined the staff at Lick Observatory in 1941. During the Second World War, he took a job as a physicist at the California Institute of Technology and worked on ballistics at the Naval Ordnance Test Station in the Mojave Desert. He returned to Lick Observatory after the war, remaining there until his retirement in 1978.

Wirtanen discovered periodic comet 46P/Wirtanen, as well as eight asteroids, including notably the Apollo asteroid (29075) 1950 DA, which may have a non-negligible probability of impacting the Earth in the year 2880. He also discovered two other Apollo asteroids: 1685 Toro and 1863 Antinous. Based on the &quot;Shane–Wirtanen survey&quot;, the Shane Wirtanen Catalogue, a count of galaxies, was his major work published in 1954.

The asteroid 2044 Wirt, discovered by himself at Lick Observatory in 1950, was named in his honor in on 1 January 1981 (). The name was proposed by his colleague Arnold Klemola.

Wirtanen died in Santa Cruz, California in 1990 following a lengthy illness. His remains were scattered at sea.

<text>Archibald Henry Sayce (25 September 18454 February 1933) was a pioneer British Assyriologist and linguist, who held a chair as Professor of Assyriology at the University of Oxford from 1891 to 1919. He was able to write in at least twenty ancient and modern languages, and was known for his emphasis on the importance of archaeological and monumental evidence in linguistic research. He was a contributor to articles in the 9th, 10th and 11th editions of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;.

== Life ==
Sayce was born in Shirehampton, near Bristol, on 25 September 1845. Although the start of his education was delayed due to ill health he had suffered since birth, Sayce was a quick learner. When his first tutor was appointed in 1855, he was already reading works in Latin and Ancient Greek. He began his formal education at Grosvenor College shortly after his family moved to Bath in 1858. By the age of 18, he had already taught himself to read some Ancient Egyptian, Sanskrit and Hebrew and had become interested in cuneiform. He published his first academic paper, &quot;Cuneiform inscriptions of Van&quot; in 1865.

In 1865 he became a classical scholar at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. While a student at Oxford, Sayce became friends with Max Müller, John Rhys, John Ruskin and Henry Acland. Due to his poor health, Sayce spent time away from Oxford, and carried out his studies at home and on visits to the Pyrenees and Switzerland. Sayce achieved a first-class in Classical Moderations (Greek and Latin) in 1866 and in Literae Humaniores (Philosophy and Ancient History) in 1868, and was elected to a vacant Fellowship in the same year.

In 1869, Sayce was appointed a lecturer at Queen&#x27;s College. He was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1870. Ongoing problems with his sight almost led to the end of his Oxford career and Sayce spent much of his time travelling Europe. It was only from 1874, when he came under the supervision of ophthalmologist Richard Liebreich, that Sayce was able to continue his academic career. In the same year he was appointed as the university&#x27;s representative in the Old Testament Revision Company. Sayce also began to deliver lectures to the Nineveh Society of Biblical Archaeology and contributed to &quot;The Times&quot; and the New York &quot;Independent&quot;. In 1876 Sayce was appointed the Deputy Professor of Comparative Philology, a role shared with the continuing Professor, Max Müller, who wanted to reduce his duties.

From 1872, Sayce spent most of his summers travelling for his health and in search of new texts. In 1879 he resigned from his tutorship at Oxford to dedicate his time to his research and exploring the near East. In 1881, Sayce was one of the first scholars to examine the Siloam Inscription, which he described in the Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly. Sayce resigned his professorship in 1890 and briefly moved to Egypt, where he was instrumental in the reopening of the Museum of Cairo in 1891. In 1891, Sayce returned to Oxford to become the university&#x27;s first Professor of Assyriology.

Lectures were his favourite vehicle for publication, and he published his Hibbert Lectures on Babylonian religion in 1887. Sayce was also the Gifford Lecturer, 1900–1902; and Rhind Lecturer, 1906.

Sayce was a founding member of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, which he presided from 1898 until it was absorbed into the Royal Asiatic Society in 1919. He was also an active member of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1874 and a founding member of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies.

After his retirement in 1915, Sayce continued to write and spent his time in Edinburgh, Oxford and Egypt. By the end of his life, Sayce was considered to be an amateur rather than a specialist and was criticized for his lack of intellectual penetration and outdated opposition to the work of continental orientalists. In 1923, he published &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, an account of his life and his numerous travels. At the time of his death he was working on a translation of inscriptions discovered at Ras Shamra. Sayce died on 4 February 1933 in Bath.

==Research==

===Sumerian and Akkadian languages===
Sayce&#x27;s early research examined Sumerian and Akkadian languages. His article &quot;An Accadian Seal&quot; (1870), includes the discovery of many of the linguistic principles of Sumerian. Sayce&#x27;s &quot;An Assyrian grammar for comparative purposes&quot; (1872), drew attention from established Assyriologists to the &#x27;new&#x27; language. In 1874, Sayce published his paper, &quot;The Astronomy and Astrology of the Babylonians&quot;, one of the first articles to translate astronomical cuneiform texts.

===Science of language===
Sayce is also seen by some as one of founding fathers of the &#x27;Reform Movement&#x27; in linguistic research at the end of the 19th century. His two notable works, &quot;Introduction to the Science of Language&quot; (1879), and &quot;The Principles of Comparative Philology&quot; (1880), introduced audiences to the changing continental linguistic trends in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The books challenged the current thinking in comparative philology and the importance of what Sayce termed the principle of analogy.

===Hittite language===
In the late 1870s, Sayce moved away from his Sumerian studies and concentrated upon Indo-European languages. He theorized that the &quot;pseudo-sesostris&quot; rock carvings in Asia Minor, such as the Karabel relief which had been historically attributed to the Egyptians, were actually created by another pre-Greek culture. In 1876 he speculated that the hieroglyphs in inscriptions discovered at Hamath in Syria, were not related to Assyrian or Egyptian scripts but came from another culture he identified as the Hittites. In 1879, Sayce further theorized that reliefs and inscriptions at Karabel, İvriz, , Carchemish, Alaca Höyük, and Yazilikaya were created by the Hittites. His hypothesis was confirmed when he visited some of the sites on a tour of the Near East in the same year. On his return to England, Sayce presented a lecture to the Society of Biblical Archaeology in London, where he announced that the Hittites where a much more influential culture than previously thought with their own art and language. Sayce concluded that the Hittite hieroglyphic system was predominantly a syllabary, that is, its symbols stood for a phonetic syllable. There were too many different signs for a system, that was alphabetical and yet there were too few for it to be a set of ideographs. That very sign standing for the divinity had appeared on the stones of Hamath and other places, always in the form of a prefix of an indecipherable group of hieroglyphics naming the deities. This led Sayce to conclude that by finding the name of one of these deities with the help of another language endowed with similar pronunciation, one might analyse the conversion of the aforesaid name in Hittite hieroglyphics. Also, he stated that the keys to be obtained through that process might in turn be applied to other parts of a Hittite inscription where the same sign were to occur.

Sayce dreamed of finding a Hittite &quot;Rosetta Stone&quot; to help with his research. Sayce attempted to translate a short Hittite hieroglyphic inscription found with a cuneiform text on a silver disk featuring a representation of the Hittite king, Tarkondemos. He and William Wright also identified the ruins at Boghazkoy with Hattusa, the capital of a Hittite Empire that stretched from the Aegean Sea to the banks of the Euphrates.

Sayce published his research on the Hittites in &quot;The Hittites: The Story of a Forgotten Empire&quot; in 1888. Sayce produced many studies on the Hittites and their language, but they were criticised by fellow scholars as his work did not apply Historical criticism, and his attempts to decipher the Hittite hieroglyphics were also unsuccessful.

===Egyptology===
From the early 1880s, Sayce spent most of his winters in Egypt due to his poor health, and became interested in the archaeology of the region. Sayce was friends with Flinders Petrie and worked on cuneiform inscriptions discovered by Petrie at Tel el Amarna.
He worked at El Kab in Egypt with Somers Clarke in the 1900s. In his seasonal winter digs in Egypt he always hired a well-furnished boat on the Nile to accommodate his travelling library, which also enabled him to offer tea to visiting Egyptologists like the young American James Henry Breasted and his wife.

<doc id="591496" wikidata="Q6411977" url="?curid=591496" title="King Ranch">
<text>King Ranch is the largest ranch in the United States. At some it is larger than both the land area of Rhode Island and the area of the European country Luxembourg. It is mainly a cattle ranch, but also produced the racehorse Assault, who won the Triple Crown in 1946.

The headquarters of the King Ranch are in an office building in Houston, Texas. The ranch itself is located in South Texas between Corpus Christi and Brownsville, adjacent to Kingsville. It was founded in 1853 by Captain Richard King and Gideon K. Lewis. It includes parts of six Texas counties: most of Kleberg, much of Kenedy, and parts of Brooks, Jim Wells, Nueces, and Willacy counties.

The ranch consists of four divisions of land: Santa Gertrudis, Laureles, Encino, and Norias. The Santa Gertrudis and Laureles divisions share a short length of border, and the Encino and Norias divisions are both entirely separate. The ranch was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. The Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame inducted the ranch in 2019. King Ranch was one of the first ranches to be added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, because of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 which was signed that same day.

==History==

Richard King (1824–1885) was a river pilot, born in New York City to Irish immigrants. He was indentured to a jeweler at age 11, but later ran to sea, eventually attaining a pilot&#x27;s rating. In 1843, King first met his future business partner in the King Ranch, Mifflin Kenedy (1818–1895), captain of the steamboat &quot;Champion&quot;. Both served under General Zachary Taylor (later the 12th US president), operating steamboats from Brazos Santiago Harbor in Texas, USA, to Matamoros in Mexico, and on up river to Camargo, Tamaulipas, in support of the U.S. invasion of Monterrey and Saltillo. After the Mexican–American War, King made a good living hauling merchandise on the Rio Grande, as far up river as Camargo, and Rio Grande City. In the meantime, Kenedy was able to make money by carrying goods overland into Mexico. By March 1, 1850, King, Kenedy, Charles Stillman, founder of Brownsville, and James O&#x27;Donnell entered into a business partnership (M. Kenedy &amp; Co.) to transport Stillman&#x27;s goods from Brazos Santiago Harbor on the Gulf of Mexico and up the Rio Grande. The enterprise required two types of steamers — the &quot;Grampus&quot; and &quot;Comanche&quot;. During the American Civil War, the steamboat fleet was reflagged under the name of the Matamoros, Mexico citizen Francisco Iturria and the Mexican flag. As Mexico was a neutral country, the steamboats could not be stopped by Union blockaders, and engaged in a lively commerce of transporting Texas cotton to many deep-water ships anchored offshore Matamoros, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. Stillman sold his share of the enterprise after the Civil War; the new firm operated as King, Kenedy &amp; Co. until 1874.

King first saw the land that would become part of the King Ranch in April 1852 as he traveled north from Brownsville to attend the Lone Star Fair in Corpus Christi, a four-day trip by horseback. After a grueling ride, King caught sight of the Santa Gertrudis Creek, from the Rio Grande. It was the first stream he had seen on the Wild Horse Desert. The land, which was shaded by large mesquite trees, so impressed him, when he arrived at the fair, he and a friend, Texas Ranger Captain Gideon K. &quot;Legs&quot; Lewis, agreed then and there to make it into a ranch.

The King Ranch LK brand, still in use today, stands for partners Lewis and King.

King and Lewis established a cow camp on Santa Gertrudis Creek. During this time, Richard King purchased the &quot;Rincón de Santa Gertrudis&quot; grant, a holding that encompassed present-day Kingsville, Texas. It was purchased from the heirs of Juan Mendiola of Camargo on July 25, 1853, for $300. King sold Lewis an undivided half-interest in the land for $2,000. At the same time, Lewis sold King undivided half-interest in the ranchos of Manuel Barrera and of Juan Villareal for the same sum, on November 14, 1853. In 1854, King and Lewis purchased the &quot;de la Garza Santa Gertrudis&quot; grant from Praxides Uribe of Matamoros for $1,800, on the condition of a perfected title (complete documentation of the land grant) on May 20, 1854, to . As the years passed, more land was added, growing to 1.2 million acres (1,875 sq mi, 4,900 km2) at its largest extent, until reaching its current total.

In 1855, Lewis was killed by the husband of a woman with whom he had been having an affair. On July 1, 1856, a court sale of Lewis&#x27; property (including the undivided half-interest in the land of the Ranch) was held. King had arranged for Major W. W. Chapman (died 1859) to bid on the Rincón property, which Chapman acquired for $1,575. Chapman had been the quartermaster of Fort Brown in Brownsville, and regulated the steamboat contracts to supply Fort Ringgold, up river in Rio Grande City.

King interested Captain James Walworth in acquiring the entire de la Garza grant, and Walworth completed the purchase on December 26, 1856, for $5,000 paid to Praxides Uribe. King thus retained operational control of the Ranch, with Walworth as a silent partner who held title to the land, and who paid taxes on it.

King and Walworth&#x27;s livestock brand was registered June 27, 1859, along with his earlier brands. (see below)

When King and his partners began hiring people to staff the ranch, they hired a number of Mexican hands. In one notable case, King traveled to the village of Cruillas, Tamaulipas, Mexico in the early months of 1854 (the village having been decimated by a severe drought) and purchased the village&#x27;s entire cattle population. But shortly after leaving the village, King realized that by solving the village&#x27;s short-term problem, by providing needed income to survive the drought, he had created a longer-term one by removing its source of future income. King thus returned to Cruillas and offered the villagers the opportunity to work for him, in exchange for food, shelter, and income. Many of the villagers accepted King&#x27;s offer and relocated to Texas. As the ranch grew, these workers came to be called &quot;kineños&quot;, or &quot;King&#x27;s men&quot;. Over time, some original grantees returned to their land. King once said he &quot;could not have kept on and held on if Andrés Canales had not been adjoining.&quot;

Records show a Mexican range cow cost $6 in 1854, a mustang horse cost $6, and a stud horse cost $200–300. In sum, in 1854, King paid $12,275.79. Lea estimated the 1855 expenses were smaller. The first brand was the &quot;ere flecha&quot; (an R with arrow through it).

In 1859, the ranch recorded its first official brands (HK and LK). In 1869, the ranch registered its &quot;Running W&quot; brand, which remains the King Ranch&#x27;s official mark today. At the time, the ranch grazed cattle, horses, sheep and goats. By the mid-1870s, though, the ranch&#x27;s hallmark stock had become the hardy Texas Longhorn. The ranch also boasted several Brahman bulls, as well as Beef Shorthorns and Herefords.
The Brahmans, which were native to South Asia, were well adapted to thrive in South Texas&#x27; hot climate; they were crossed with the ranch&#x27;s Beef Shorthorns to produce the ranch&#x27;s own trademark stock — the Santa Gertrudis cattle, which were recognized as a breed in 1940.

Lea portrays King&#x27;s purchase of the Ranch as motivated by his wooing of Henrietta Maria Morse Chamberlain (1832–1925), whom he married in the First Presbyterian Church, Brownsville, on Sunday, December 10, 1854. The King Ranch HK livestock brand stands for Henrietta King.

During the United States Civil War, the disruption of the flow of cattle to market initially caused a drop in beef prices. In 1861, the price of cattle dropped to $2 per head, but it rose again to $11 per head by August 1862.

The 1863-1864 winter pushed uncounted cattle south toward the Nueces River and Rio Grande. After the Civil War, the Texas Rangers were disbanded during the reconstruction of the United States. It became very tempting and low-risk to simply herd cattle across the Nueces or Rio Grande.

Even in this time of loss, by 1869, King was able to round up 48,664 of an estimated 84,000 head of cattle. Allowing for 10,000 remaining, King claimed a loss of 33,827 head from 1869 to 1872. To handle depredations (rustling), the ranchers formed the Stock Raisers Association of Western Texas in 1870; Mifflin Kenedy led the first meeting. By 1874, the Texas Rangers were re-established, and were a factor in controlling the depredations.

By 1870, 300,000 head of cattle made their way from the West to the railroads of Kansas, and thence to the stockyards of Chicago. On a Texas ranch, a steer worth $11 would bring $20 from a buyer in Abilene. The buyer in turn could ask $31.50 at the Union Stock Yards. King could drive his cattle for a hundred days to the railheads of Kansas.

By 1871, though, 700,000 head of cattle caused a market glut, which King avoided by personal negotiation in Abilene.

King managed to avoid the September 19, 1873, &#x27;Black Friday panic&#x27; by selling early. During the lean year that followed, King continued to fence his land, and manage his cattle, horses, and sheep.

One technique King used to manage costs was to make his trail bosses the owners of the herd. The bosses would sign a note for the cattle, which they would begin to drive to market in February of each year, for the 100-day drive. The bosses were also the employers of the outfit. Upon the sale of the herd to the northern buyers, the trail bosses could relieve their indebtedness, and earn a profit greater than their ordinary wages.

Richard King died in 1885. At the death of Henrietta King in 1925, the ranch totaled 1.2 million acres that were divided among her heirs. Henrietta King&#x27;s sole surviving child, Alice Gertrudis Kleberg, and her husband Robert J. Kleberg Jr. inherited over 800,000 acres that were incorporated as the King Ranch in 1934. The appraiser&#x27;s &quot;Statement of Gross Estate, Mrs. H. M. King&quot; listed a net total of $5.4 million, as the owner of 997,444.56 acres (4,036.5 km2), which did not include the Santa Gertrudis headquarters, nor did it include the Kleberg&#x27;s Stillman and Lasater tracts, which were not of the estate. Her son-in-law, Bob Kleberg, said &quot;A valuation of four to five dollars an acre ($1236/km2) on a million acres (4000 km2) of raw ranchland was about right, but it took a long time for the Government to admit it.&quot; By 1929, the taxes ($859,000) had been paid up, in installments, but the trustees had to borrow money, so by the market crash of 1929, Henrietta King&#x27;s estate was in debt $3,000,000.

Robert Justus Kleberg Jr. and Alice Gertrudis King had five children, including a son named Robert J. Kleberg, III. In 1933, Robert J. Kleberg, III leased the exploration and drilling rights on the ranch to Humble Oil of Houston, Texas, for $127,824, in exchange for the usual royalty of 1/8th of the sale price for all oil and gas produced from the property. Humble Oil loaned enough money to pay the debts of the H.M. King estate, secured by a first mortgage on the land. Humble struck oil and gas by 1939. During all of this, the Ranch was a going concern, with a net profit of $227,382, as early as 1926. Robert Kleberg III was married to Helen Campbell, and together they had a daughter they named Helen.

Lauro Cavazos, who served as the first Hispanic United States Cabinet officer, was born on the King Ranch during his father&#x27;s service as a ranch foreman in January, 1927.

On November 18, 1936, Luther Blanton and his son, John, trespassed on the ranch by crawling through the fence surrounding it. They had intended to hunt ducks and nearby residents reported hearing shots fired. Shortly thereafter, locals organized a group to force their way onto the ranch around the area where they were known to have gone hunting. However, neither Blanton nor his son were ever seen again. A subsequent police investigation resulted in no arrests. Although most residents suspected them being murdered by ranch guards for trespassing, it remains a long-standing unsolved mystery.

During World War II, the Navy purchased lots of land to construct the Kingsville Naval Outlying Fields to support naval flight training. Many of these airfields have since been demolished and reverted to farmland.

In February 1961, &quot;National Geographic&quot; reported that the ranch covered 980,000 acres.

In 1999 (since the 2001 model year to present), Ford began using the King Ranch brand on its vehicles. Over the years there have been King Ranch versions of the F-150, Super Duty, Explorer, and Expedition. They include dark brown leather seats, and the badges show the King Ranch &#x27;Running W&#x27; brand.

==Education==

Santa Gertrudis Independent School District&#x27;s original elementary and middle school facility, built in 1917, was leased from the King Ranch and located on ranch property (the Santa Gertrudis portion). It was a , 13 classroom complex with a classroom building, four annexes, two storage structures, and a gymnasium that had the possibility of being used for other reasons. The district now has a new campus built by PBK Architects.

Under Texas law, the Santa Gertrudis ISD area is in the boundary of Coastal Bend College (referred to in legislation under its former name, &quot;Bee County College&quot;).

==In popular culture==
Edna Ferber&#x27;s novel &quot;Giant&quot;, which was turned into a film of the same name, takes place on King Ranch. The film and novel depict several events in the ranch&#x27;s history, such as the discovery of oil on the property.

&quot;Forever Texas&quot;, the 2022 historical western novel by bestselling authors William W. Johnstone and J.A. Johnstone, is based on the true story of the founding of King Ranch.

In the James Michener novel &quot;Centennial&quot;, the Venneford Ranch was said to be patterned after the King Ranch.

The historical fiction novel &quot;Lords of the Land&quot; by Matt Braun is based on the King Ranch and its founder, although names and some circumstance have been altered.

A cowboy&#x27;s perspective on the King Ranch subsidiary in Australia, the cattle station Brunette Downs, is captured in the 2012 autobiography by Nick Campbell-Jones &quot;Don&#x27;t Die Wondering&quot;. Campbell-Jones was a jackaroo (Australian cowboy) who started at Brunette Downs in 1963 and worked his way up to overseer and assistant manager before leaving in 1975.

<text>Yellowcard is an American rock band that formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1997. Their official lineup currently consists of lead singer Ryan Key, lead guitarist Ryan Mendez, bassist Josh Portman and violinist Sean Mackin. Primarily a pop-punk group, their music is recognized for having a distinct and unique sound in its genre due to their prominent use of a violin. The group&#x27;s most-recognized singles include &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;, &quot;Only One&quot;, and &quot;Lights and Sounds&quot;. Released in 2003, &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; and its parent album of the same name are both certified double platinum and platinum in the US respectively by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); &quot;Only One&quot; and the band&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Lights and Sounds&quot; have been certified gold. The band has released ten studio albums, with its most recent, &quot;Yellowcard&quot;, released on September 30, 2016. Following this release and supporting tour, the quartet disbanded. They reunited in September 2022 for a performance at Riot Fest and embarked on a 20th-anniversary tour for &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; in 2023. A new EP, &quot;Childhood Eyes&quot;, was released on July 21, 2023.

==History==
===Formation and early material (1997–2002)===
Yellowcard was formed in 1997 in Jacksonville, Florida, after its members met at Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. The band got its name from a phrase its members used in high school: whenever somebody did something stupid at a party, such as spilling beer on the carpet, they cited soccer laws and gave the offender a &quot;yellow card&quot; for committing a &quot;party foul&quot;.

Yellowcard&#x27;s original lineup featured Ben Dobson on vocals, Todd Clary on guitar and vocals, Ben Harper on guitar, Warren Cooke on bass, and Longineu Parsons III on drums. Modern Amusement frontman Ryan Key appeared as a guest, on background vocals, as did violinist Sean Mackin. Key had also been in California band Craig&#x27;s Brother.

Yellowcard recorded their first LP, &quot;Midget Tossing&quot;, at the Music Factory in Jacksonville Beach with Michael Ray FitzGerald at the board. &quot;Where We Stand&quot;, the band&#x27;s second album, featured the same lineup as &quot;Midget Tossing&quot;, while Mackin was brought in for more songs. Soon, however, the band fired Dobson and replaced him with former guest vocalist Key. This changed the band&#x27;s style from hardcore punk to pop punk.

In early 2000, Yellowcard recorded the &quot;Still Standing&quot; EP. Soon after it was released, Todd Clary left the band. Key then filled both Clary&#x27;s and Dobson&#x27;s duties, guitar and vocals respectively. After sending the new EP to friend Steve Lubarsky at Lobster Records, the band signed its first recording contract in June 2000 and in November, headed west to Camarillo, California, to begin working on another full-length album. The group released its third album, &quot;One for the Kids&quot; (Lobster Records), in 2001 and followed up with &quot;The Underdog EP&quot; (Fueled by Ramen Records) in 2002. Both of these were well received by fans. However, soon after &quot;The Underdog EP&quot; was released, Warren Cooke left for personal reasons on July 16, 2002. The band then asked Pete Mosely from Inspection 12 to play bass, and he joined the band four days later.

===&quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; (2003–2005)===
Shortly after releasing &quot;The Underdog EP&quot;, Yellowcard signed with Capitol Records. The group recorded their major-label debut &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; in February–March 2003 and released on July 22, 2003. During the recording of the album, Mosely left Yellowcard, devoting his time to his first band, Inspection 12, and finishing the band&#x27;s album, &quot;Get Rad&quot;. The members of Yellowcard began the search for a new bass player and chose Alex Lewis, whose sister, Alieke Wijnveldt, contributed vocals to the &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; track &quot;View from Heaven&quot;. After Lewis joined, the band filmed an unreleased music video for the song &quot;Powder&quot;. The video was later put on the enhanced version of &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;.

Yellowcard released its first single from &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;, &quot;Way Away&quot;. The song did well on MTV2 and rock radio, peaking at No. 25 on the modern-rock charts. The song created enough buzz to cause the band&#x27;s mainstream explosion. In the middle of the band&#x27;s first headlining tour, Peter Mosely decided to leave Inspection 12 and asked if he could rejoin Yellowcard. Because Mosely had been an integral part of the writing for &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; and had also been friends with most of the band&#x27;s members since high school, Lewis was asked to leave on March 1, 2004, and Mosely was reinstated as the bass player.

In late 2003, Yellowcard finally broke through with a hit single, &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;, in part due to the song premiering on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. Radio eventually picked up on the single, with it peaking at No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 during the summer of 2004. The band experienced its peak popularity during the second half of 2004. They were cover features on &quot;Alternative Press&quot; magazine, a headliner of the 2004 Warped Tour, performed &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; and won the MTV2 award at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, and were featured in the season 2 premiere of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; with their song &quot;Empty Apartment&quot;. The band was featured episode 3 in season 8 of MTV&#x27;s Real World/Road Rules Challenge (later abridged to &quot;The Challenge&quot;), performing &quot;Way Away&quot; while cast members trashed a mock hotel room for a &quot;rock star redecoration&quot; challenge. The album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Way Away&quot;, appeared on the soundtracks of &quot;SSX 3&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot;. The album&#x27;s second track, &quot;Breathing&quot;, also appeared in EA&#x27;s &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot; and &quot;FlatOut 2&quot;. Following the success of &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;, the band released the single &quot;Only One&quot;, a rock ballad which also did fairly well on TRL and radio. The &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; album sold over one million copies in the U.S. alone.

During this time, Yellowcard contributed songs to various other soundtracks. The first, &quot;Gifts and Curses&quot;, appeared in the hit film &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. Another, a cover of Lagwagon&#x27;s &quot;Violins&quot;, was featured on &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 2&quot; compilation album. At the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, Yellowcard performed a cover of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot; during a special tribute to the movie &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;.

On August 13, 2013, an acoustic version of &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; was released in honor of the album&#x27;s 10th anniversary.

===&quot;Lights and Sounds&quot; (2005–2006)===

After almost two years of touring, Yellowcard took a few months off at the beginning of 2005. Ryan Key and Peter Mosely moved to New York City to write the songs for the group&#x27;s next album. The rest of the band remained in Los Angeles. The band regrouped in LA in the spring and began pre-production for the follow-up to &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; in March. Recording and production was finished in September, and advertising began for the album. The band had originally announced that the album was expected for August 2005, but production and other delays pushed the release date back several months.

In the months following, many problems had arisen between the bandmates, with Key stating, &quot;The fame went to our heads.&quot; After months of increasing tension stemming from Ben Harper&#x27;s increased involvement with his indie label Takeover Records, Harper was removed from Yellowcard. He was replaced by Ryan Mendez from the band Staring Back.

&quot;Lights and Sounds&quot; was finally released on January 24, 2006. A loose concept album, the theme centers around Yellowcard&#x27;s negative feelings towards Los Angeles. Prior to the release of &quot;Lights and Sounds&quot; Ryan Key said that this ambitious album would probably alienate a large portion of the group&#x27;s fan base, and that he was &quot;100 percent okay with that.&quot; 20 songs were recorded for the album, 14 of which are on the CD, plus a B-side available on import versions, CD singles, and at the iTunes Store, called &quot;Three Flights Down&quot;. The opening track, &quot;Three Flights Up&quot;, was the first instrumental track on a Yellowcard album since &quot;Interlewd&quot; on the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Midget Tossing&quot;. Those two and &quot;Convocation&quot; from their 2014 release, &quot;Lift a Sail&quot;, are the only instrumental tracks the band has released on an album.

The title track, &quot;Lights and Sounds&quot;, was the first single, released a week before the album. It peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Tracks. It is also featured on the video games &quot;Burnout Revenge&quot; and &quot;Guitar Hero: Modern Hits&quot;. In its first week of release, the album sold just over 90,000 copies, but it only went on to receive gold status. High first week sales are most likely the result of high anticipation of the album, as it was the follow-up to the highly successful &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;; low total sales backup Key&#x27;s statement about the album being very ambitious and different in sound from &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot;. On May 6, 2006, the second and final single and video of the album, &quot;Rough Landing, Holly&quot;, was released. The single was not as well received as the first, and after its first week of release, it quickly dropped on the charts.

In May 2006, Ryan Key had surgery on his vocal chords after having problems with his singing. He had started having problems in December 2005. He was mute for a week and could not sing for more than a month. Yellowcard, after canceling some shows and receiving some time off from touring, joined the Virgin Mega Tour for the summer of 2006.

===&quot;Paper Walls&quot; (2006–2008)===

On October 16, 2006, Yellowcard announced via its website that the group was back in the studio recording a new album. Guitarist Ryan Mendez posted on the official Yellowcard message board on October 21, 2006, that three songs had been completed and stated, &quot;I really think fans of both older and newer Yellowcard are going to be very happy.&quot; Pre-production began in October 2006, and tracking began in January 2007. Between the months of January and March 2007, studio footage labeled &quot;Yellowcard Sessions&quot; regarding the band&#x27;s progress on making the album was posted on their Myspace, with a new video added every Thursday. In total, 10 videos were posted, with additional footage released on the deluxe CD/DVD edition of &quot;Paper Walls&quot;. Additionally, in January 2007, some sample demo songs were released on the band&#x27;s MySpace, though they were only rough recordings from pre-production and not the final recorded versions. The first demo was a 30-second preview of the iTunes bonus track, &quot;Bombers&quot;, and the second was a clip of an unmixed version of &quot;Light Up the Sky&quot;.

The first Yellowcard show since October 2006 took place on March 29, 2007, at the Troubadour in Hollywood, California. At the show, lead singer Ryan Key announced to a sold-out crowd that the new album would be titled &quot;Paper Walls&quot;. He said he would &quot;probably get in trouble for [it]&quot;, but went on to announce the title anyway; Key also announced the album title during a concert at Southern Connecticut State University. During the Troubadour show, the group played two songs from its new album (&quot;Fighting&quot; and &quot;The Takedown&quot;). Yellowcard played an acoustic set the next night at the Troubadour and premiered two new songs, &quot;Shadows and Regrets&quot; and &quot;Light Up the Sky&quot;.

In the teaser of an interview with Jason Tate of absolutepunk.net released on June 17 (one month before the release of the album), Key described the album as

 ... very much a record of hope and finding yourself again. It&#x27;s after you&#x27;ve come through all of that – going to the height of it – and picking yourself back up again. And by &quot;hitting rock bottom&quot;, I don&#x27;t mean in record sales or fame or any of that shit. I mean personally – emotionally ... Paper Walls is the story, the feeling, of what it&#x27;s like to be out of those holes, looking back, no regrets, but smarter and having grown through them.

The whole interview was released on July 17, the release date of the album.

Yellowcard announced on May 15 via Myspace that the first single from &quot;Paper Walls&quot; would be &quot;Light Up the Sky&quot;. This song was released to iTunes and radio on June 5. Soon after its release, &quot;Paper Walls&quot; became the second most popular album on iTunes and the most popular album in the alternative section. On July 9, Yellowcard released &quot;Paper Walls&quot; on the group&#x27;s Myspace music player to give fans a taste of what was to come on the new album. &quot;Paper Walls&quot; was released in the U.S. on July 17 (July 16 on iTunes) in an additional CD/DVD format, as &quot;Lights and Sounds&quot; was the previous year. The DVD contains exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of the band, an extensive photo gallery and two additional live bonus tracks. In June 2007, Yellowcard was voted to do AOL Sessions Under Cover. It was released on July 20 and featured two songs from &quot;Paper Walls&quot;. The album debuted at No. 13 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling about 40,000 copies in its first week.

Yellowcard promoted &quot;Paper Walls&quot; nonstop after its release and started touring to support the album. The group supported Blue October during the band&#x27;s United States 2007 fall tour and also supported Linkin Park in Japan in November/December 2007. While touring for &quot;Paper Walls&quot;, Peter Mosely announced in a Myspace blog message that he would be leaving Yellowcard to pursue other endeavors, moving back to Jacksonville and rejoining his old band. Josh Portman from the bands Near Miss and Staring Back took over on bass until the reformation of Yellowcard in 2010, upon which Sean O&#x27;Donnell of Reeve Oliver became the bass player.

On January 7, Yellowcard went to the Middle East to do a USO tour. The group went to Kuwait as originally planned, but could not get into Iraq because of the President arriving and canceling all flights there. The band released a live album on January 22, 2008, titled &quot;iTunes Live from Las Vegas at the Palms&quot;. It was recorded during their Blue October Tour in October 2007. The band canceled several European shows in January due to drummer Longineu Parsons taking a couple months off. He spent the time in Jacksonville, Florida, with his grandmother, who raised him and whose health was failing. The band was originally scheduled to headline a spring tour with All Time Low, but All Time Low dropped out to take part in the &quot;Alternative Press&quot; spring tour. They were then replaced by MxPx, who canceled a few weeks later. Yellowcard then went on an acoustic tour with The Spill Canvas, Secondhand Serenade, PlayRadioPlay!, and Treaty of Paris.

===Hiatus (2008–2010)===

Yellowcard announced in an interview in April 2008 that the group would be going on an &quot;indefinite hiatus.&quot; The band&#x27;s European tour set for 2008 was canceled, and they instead embarked on an acoustic tour in the spring of 2008 before going on hiatus. Among the reasons for the band&#x27;s hiatus were individual member situations. Longineu Parsons took some time off in the winter to spend time with family and joined a side project band based in Jacksonville, Florida. Sean Mackin got married in 2008 and wanted to take some time off to spend with his family. Ryan Key stated that the members needed some time to figure out their personal lives. The band members were unsure of the hiatus&#x27; length, but they assured their fans they planned to return as a group. In May 2008, Yellowcard left Capitol Records and was left unsigned. On June 16, 2009, Capitol released an EP titled &quot;Deep Cuts&quot;, which consists of four previously released tracks.

Ryan Key and Sean O&#x27;Donnell of Reeve Oliver formed a small side project called Big If. Big If released many demos online and had a record due out in late 2009 which was cancelled. The band featured a more pop punk approach in most of its first songs, though by the time they had reached the second set of demos, they had almost completely progressed into a pop rock style. After the band&#x27;s fourth set of demos, the band announced a fundraising event on February 10, 2010, called the &quot;Help Mend A Heart Auction&quot;, which was to fund Jordan Pundik&#x27;s mother&#x27;s heart transplant operation. After that final announcement, there has been no word from the band, and their Myspace page is no longer active.

Parsons played drums for Adam Lambert from October 2009 through September 18, 2010, before returning to Yellowcard after its hiatus.

===Reformation and &quot;When You&#x27;re Through Thinking, Say Yes&quot; (2010–2012)===
Longineu Parsons mentioned in a YouTube video that Yellowcard had started talking about a new record. Yellowcard&#x27;s official Facebook page announced on August 1, 2010, that the band had reformed and would be working on a new record. Josh Portman, the former bass player, was replaced by Sean O&#x27;Donnell of Dogwood and Reeve Oliver and Ryan&#x27;s other side project, Big If. In the May issue of &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, former bassist Pete Mosely revealed he was contacted by Parsons about rejoining before the band reconvened, but ultimately decided not to reunite with the rest of Yellowcard. 

Since the reformation announcement, the Yellowcard YouTube account was reopened and featured weekly sessions about the recording of the new album. It was also in these sessions that a handful of names and snippets of songs were released. Big If songs &quot;Empty Street&quot;, &quot;Hide&quot;, and &quot;Hang You Up&quot; were rumored to be reworked and featured on the new record (&quot;Empty Street&quot; ultimately did not make the cut). One of the first confirmed tracks on the new record, &quot;See Me Smiling&quot;, was originally an instrumental demo Ryan Mendez wrote and recorded at his home studio, which he sent to the other band members. They decided to record it for the new record. The bridge is one of Key&#x27;s favorite vocal parts in all of Yellowcard&#x27;s library. &quot;Sing For Me&quot; was confirmed in the November issue of &quot;Alternative Press Magazine&quot;, issue 269. The song is written from the perspective of Key&#x27;s terminally ill aunt, Aunt Stephanie, who was mentioned in &quot;Rock Star Land&quot;. The recording process finished on November 8, 2010. The band later announced the name and release date of the first single, &quot;For You, and Your Denial&quot;. It was made available for purchase on iTunes and streaming at www.absolutepunk.net starting January 18, 2011. Also, the music video for this song was released. The second single, &quot;Hang You Up&quot;, was released February 22. The new album released on March 22, 2011, on iTunes and CD.

Yellowcard released dates for concerts for part of 2010 and the majority of 2011. The band toured with All Time Low throughout Europe in March 2011, around the same time that the album was released. On November 13, 2010, the band played its first show after coming back from hiatus at The Glass House in Pomona, California. This was the first time the whole band had played together since December 2007. During the show, Ryan Key revealed the name of the new record after insistent chants. The new record, he announced, was to be titled &quot;When You&#x27;re Through Thinking, Say Yes&quot;. Shortly afterward, the group played the first single from the new record, &quot;For You, and Your Denial&quot;. Responding to the apparent lack of Yellowcard&#x27;s older work at The Glass House show, Key stated that it was to keep the energy up in the crowds. In addition to the Europe tour in March, Yellowcard announced a spring 2011 U.S. tour with All Time Low, Hey Monday, and The Summer Set. In the late spring and early summer of 2011, Yellowcard participated in a brief U.S. tour with Good Charlotte and Runner Runner. In June 2011, during an interview with Punkvideosrock.com, Ryan Key stated that the band would participate in a headlining tour in the fall of 2011. In fall 2011, the band headlined a U.S. tour with Go Radio and Every Avenue (with whom Ryan Key had co-written two songs: &quot;Girl Like That&quot; (2009) and &quot;Tie Me Down&quot; (2011)).

Ryan Key also recorded a song with Silverstein called &quot;Stay Posi&quot; for the &quot;Take Action! Vol. 10&quot; compilation.

On October 24, 2011, Yellowcard released &quot;When You&#x27;re Through Thinking, Say Yes Acoustic&quot;. This release was generally a surprise to the fan base, as it was announced only two days earlier during the group&#x27;s show in Chicago (and sold following the show at the merchandise table). The album was streaming on Absolutepunk.net for one day and is now available on iTunes. In addition, the band mentioned that the record is available at select indie record stores. Beginning on November 28, 2011, and continuing into December, Yellowcard participated in a Co-Headlining a Tour with Saves The Day and supporting act The Wonder Years. The tour stopped at several cities in the UK including Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, and London. Beginning around the holidays in mid-December, the band returned to the United States, completing more than a full year of touring.

===&quot;Southern Air&quot; and &quot;Ocean Avenue Acoustic&quot; (2012–2014)===
Yellowcard announced at several shows in November 2011 that the group would be returning to the studio in early 2012 to record a new record. Key stated that the positive reception from &quot;When You&#x27;re Through Thinking, Say Yes&quot; and the overall positive energy that the band was generating was inspiration to begin writing again. The band had already begun to write material for the new record. On February 10, it was announced that all the new music had been demoed, and Key would start writing lyrics. On February 3, 2012, Sean O&#x27;Donnell posted a message on Yellowcard&#x27;s website stating he was leaving the band because he was getting married and wanted to focus on his family. On the 17th of the same month, also on the band&#x27;s website, it was announced that Josh Portman would be filling the spot as bassist. On March 5, 2012, the group entered the studio to begin recording their next album. Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low, Cassadee Pope of Hey Monday, and Taylor Jardine of We Are the In Crowd were confirmed to be appearing as guest vocalists on the album. Yellowcard announced that it had finished the record on April 8, after five weeks of recording. On May 21, the first single from the album, &quot;Always Summer&quot;, premiered on the website AbsolutePunk and was available for free streaming. The next day, it was available for purchase on iTunes and Amazon.
On July 11, Yellowcard released the opening track for &quot;Southern Air&quot;, &quot;Awakening&quot;. The lyric video of the song was released online via Hopeless Records. On July 15, the band confirmed that the next single would be called &quot;Here I Am Alive&quot;, which was released on July 31. On August 7, the full album was made available for streaming on YouTube under Hopeless Records. The &quot;Here I Am Alive&quot; music video featuring Tay Jardine premiered on August 14 on MTV. On August 21, acoustic versions of &quot;Always Summer&quot; and &quot;Here I Am Alive&quot; became available on Hopeless Records&#x27; YouTube channel. On September 26, Yellowcard released an acoustic version of &quot;Telescope&quot; on Hopeless Records&#x27; YouTube channel. On December 10, 2012, the band released a music video for &quot;Awakening&quot; on MTV Buzzworthy.

On December 6, Yellowcard&#x27;s members announced that they were back in the studio. On May 3, 2013, the band confirmed rumors via Twitter about the recording of an acoustic remake of &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; in honor of the platinum album&#x27;s 10th anniversary. On June 3, 2013, pre-orders were set up for &quot;Ocean Avenue Acoustic&quot;. The album was released on August 13, 2013. The band also announced an &quot;Ocean Avenue Acoustic&quot; tour that fall with guest Geoff Rickly of Thursday. During the tour, the band performed &quot;Paper Walls&quot; live for the first time.

On October 29, 2013, Yellowcard announced that the group would be releasing a cover of Tony Sly&#x27;s song called &quot;Already Won&quot;, which is included in &quot;The Songs of Tony Sly: A Tribute&quot;. The band was also featured on a &quot;Punk Goes Christmas&quot; compilation with a cover of &quot;Christmas Lights&quot; by Coldplay.

During January and February 2014, Yellowcard completed a second leg of the &quot;Ocean Avenue Acoustic&quot; across the United States in cities that the group had not previously performed; the tour was supported by What&#x27;s Eating Gilbert. At various shows during the tour and on the members personal social media accounts, the band members began stating that they had been writing new music and would be returning to the studio that year.

===Parsons&#x27; departure and &quot;Lift a Sail&quot; (2014–2015)===
On February 12, 2014, it was announced that Yellowcard would be playing the entire 2014 Vans Warped Tour. On March 13, 2014, the band announced that drummer and founding member Longineu Parsons III had left the band. On March 20, Yellowcard announced it had left Hopeless Records after three years and three albums to sign a worldwide multi-album deal with Razor &amp; Tie. It was then announced that a new record would be released in the fall of 2014. On March 24, the band announced that Nate Young from Anberlin would be playing drums on the new album and on April 14, further confirmed that he would perform with the band at the Warped Tour.

On August 4, 2014, Yellowcard announced that the next album would be titled &quot;Lift a Sail&quot;. On the same day, the Yellowcard Twitter account linked to a post from AbsolutePunk.net which revealed the album&#x27;s artwork and track list. The album would have 13 tracks. Also on August 4, the band announced a co-headline tour with Memphis May Fire, with special guests Emarosa. The tour would take place across the U.S. in the fall of 2014 and would begin the week after the album was released. On the 28th of the same month, it was announced that Tucker Rule, formerly of the band Thursday, would be drumming on the tour. On August 19, 2014, Yellowcard released the first single, &quot;One Bedroom&quot;, as the lead single taken from &quot;Lift a Sail&quot;, which would be released October 7, 2014. Yellowcard toured the UK with Less Than Jake in the spring of 2015 and Australia with Mayday Parade in the summer of 2015 and in the U.S. with New Found Glory from October 18 to November 22, 2015.

===Eponymous final album and break-up (2016–2017)===

On February 24, 2016, Hopeless Records announced that Yellowcard had rejoined the label and that the band was recording an album, which was to be released in late 2016. Nate Young was confirmed to be playing drums on the new record. On April 6, 2016, Ryan Key confirmed on his Twitter account that the name of one of the new tracks would be &quot;I&#x27;m a Wrecking Ball&quot;, which was written and demoed in 2008 with Ryan Mendez and Dan McLintock. On June 7, 2016, the band announced on Facebook that its new album would be self-titled; &quot;Yellowcard&quot; was released on September 30, 2016. On June 24, 2016, the band released the lead single off of the album titled &quot;Rest In Peace&quot;. On August 17, 2016, the music video for &quot;The Hurt Is Gone&quot; was released.

On March 22, 2016, it was announced that Yellowcard would be playing the entire 2016 Vans Warped Tour. On June 25, 2016, the band announced on its website that the group would be breaking up after a final tour, stating: &quot;Please come and join us on our last trip around the globe. We hope to share this final record and tour with each and every one of you.&quot; The tour continued to the United Kingdom in December 2016, an Australian tour in February 2017, then one last string of US dates on the west coast in March. The group announced that Jimmy Brunkvist from Like Torches would fulfill drumming duties for the final touring cycle. On March 21 and 22, the band played make-up shows to sold-out crowds in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Tempe, Arizona, respectively. The band played their final show on March 25, 2017, at the House Of Blues in Anaheim, California. On April 12, 2017, the final music video, &quot;A Place We Set Afire&quot; was released. 

=== Post-breakup and Juice Wrld lawsuit (2017-2021) ===
Following the band&#x27;s breakup, Key pursued a solo career under his full name, William Ryan Key. He released three EPs and toured as a solo act, with Mendez and Portman occasionally appearing onstage with him. Key also served as a touring guitarist for New Found Glory beginning in 2018, and made appearances at Linkin Park&#x27;s tribute concert for their late singer Chester Bennington in October 2017 and at the 2018 Vans Warped Tour.

In 2019, members of the &quot;Lights and Sounds&quot;-era lineup of Yellowcard collectively sued rapper Juice Wrld, claiming that his song &quot;Lucid Dreams&quot; plagiarized the melody of their song &quot;Holly Wood Died&quot;. The band recruited lawyer Richard Busch, who was best known for representing the estate of Marvin Gaye during the &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; case. It was reported Busch&#x27;s law firm were suing Juice Wrld for $15 million; Busch himself, however, claimed that the value was &quot;falsely reported&quot;, and that the band members were &quot;simply seeking what the law allows, and what parties in their position have sought in similar cases, which at this point is not determined&quot;. Following the rapper&#x27;s death later that year, the members extended their deadline for a defendant to respond to the lawsuit. This intensified the controversy significantly, as many news outlets pointed out that it meant the band was still pursuing the lawsuit despite the rapper&#x27;s death. Though in a press statement, Busch did highlight that the members had very mixed emotions.&quot;My clients are certainly torn about proceeding, and understand the optics involved. But it is important to remember that this lawsuit was filed before this tragic event, and was filed because all of the defendants (and there are two other writers and several music publishers and record labels) profited off of what we believe was clear copying and infringement of Yellowcard&#x27;s work.&quot; – Richard Busch Yellowcard ultimately chose to drop the lawsuit in 2020 after Juice Wrld&#x27;s mother became the representative of his estate. Busch stated that the band was &quot;very sympathetic not only of Juice Wrld&#x27;s death, but also needed time to decide whether they really wanted to pursue the case against his grieving mother as the personal representative of his estate.&quot; He also noted, however, that the case could be refiled if the band were to change their minds.

In 2021, Key and Mendez formed an electronic music duo called JEDHA.

=== Reunion, &quot;Childhood Eyes&quot; and &quot;A Hopeful Sign&quot; (2022–present) ===

Yellowcard reunited on September 17, 2022, at Riot Fest in Chicago, Illinois. The set featured a full play-through of the album &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; as well as a handful of other songs. On September 26, the band announced they would be playing Slam Dunk Festival in May 2023. Additionally the band announced they would be playing at the When We Were Young Festival on October 21, 2023.

On February 14, 2023, the band announced a summer tour to commemorate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Ocean Avenue&quot; across the U.S. alongside Mayday Parade, This Wild Life, Story of the Year, and Anberlin. On May 20, 2023, the band announced a new single titled &quot;Childhood Eyes&quot; after a stint of teaser posts on social media. The song was released on May 31, 2023, as the lead-off single of an EP of the same name, released on July 21 via Equal Vision Records.

During a January 11, 2024, appearance on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, the band announced a collaborative project entitled &quot;A Hopeful Sign&quot;. The album consists of nine previous Yellowcard songs reimagined and reworked by ambient post rock duo Hammock. The compilation was released on February 9, 2024. The band joined Third Eye Blind on their Summer Gods Tour in the summer of 2024. While on tour, the band also released a cover of the Jimmy Eat World song &quot;Hear You Me&quot; with all proceeds being donated to a friend of the band whose family had recently experienced a loss. In September 2024, the band collaborated with Against the Current front-woman Chrissy Costanza to record a cover of &quot;A Whole New World&quot; from the 1992 Disney film &quot;Aladdin&quot; as part of Disney&#x27;s &quot;A Whole New Sound&quot; compilation album.

==Artistry, musical style and influences==

Yellowcard has mainly been described as pop-punk, alternative rock, and hardcore punk. Their first two studio albums were defined primarily by hardcore punk influences, but the band oscillated towards more of a streamlined pop punk identity when Ryan Key became the band&#x27;s lead singer. The albums &quot;Lights and Sounds&quot; (2006) and &quot;Lift A Sail&quot; (2014) saw the band experiment with alternative rock and arena rock stylings.

Key has cited Third Eye Blind, Radiohead, No Use for a Name, the Foo Fighters, Weezer, Coldplay, Propagandhi, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, the Smashing Pumpkins and NOFX as some of his most prominent musical influences. He has also listed Michael Jackson, Madonna and New Kids On The Block as helping him lead into the pop influences on Yellowcard&#x27;s music. Mackin, the band&#x27;s violinist, has cited Itzhak Perlman as one of his favorite composers, and was primarily influenced by classical music in his younger years.

Parsons, the band&#x27;s founding drummer, has credited watching &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; on MTV and listening to Pantera with sparking his initial interest in rock and heavy metal. Mendez is a fan of Lagwagon and Stone Temple Pilots.

<text>An endoenzyme, or intracellular enzyme, is an enzyme that functions within the cell in which it was produced. Because the majority of enzymes fall within this category, the term is used primarily to differentiate a specific enzyme from an exoenzyme. It is possible for a single enzyme to have both endoenzymatic and exoenzymatic functions; for example, glycolytic enzymes of Kreb&#x27;s Cycle. In most cases the term endoenzyme refers to an enzyme that binds to a bond &#x27;within the body&#x27; of a large molecule - usually a polymer. For example, an endoamylase would break down large amylose molecules into shorter dextrin chains. On the other hand, an exoenzyme removes subunits from the polymer one at a time from one end; in effect it can only act at the end ponts of a polymer. An exoamylase would therefore remove one glucose molecule at a time from the end of an amylose molecule.

<doc id="591507" wikidata="Q317386" url="?curid=591507" title="Mata mata">
<text>The mata mata, mata-mata, or matamata (Chelus fimbriata) is a South American species of freshwater turtle found in the Amazon basin and river system of the eastern Guianas. It was formerly believed to also occur in the Orinoco basin, western Guianas and upper Rio Negro–Branco system, but in 2020 these populations were found to belong to a separate species, &quot;Chelus orinocensis&quot; (Orinoco mata mata). Subsequently, some authorities have modified the common name of &quot;Chelus fimbriata&quot; to Amazon mata mata. These two are the only extant species in the genus &quot;Chelus&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The mata mata first became known to western scientists when it was described by French naturalist Pierre Barrère in 1741 as a &quot;large land turtle with spiky and ridged scales&quot; (translation). It was first scientifically described as &quot;Testudo terrestris&quot; in 1765 by Spanish zoologist Fermín Zanón Cervera, but the same scientific name was used for describing the Greek tortoise by Peter Forsskål posthumously in 1775. In 1783, the mata mata was scientifically described again, this time as &quot;Testudo fimbriata&quot; by German naturalist Johann Gottlob Schneider. In 1805, it was moved to its own genus as &quot;Chelys fimbriata&quot; by André Marie Constant Duméril. From the mid 1700s to the late 1800s, altogether 15 different scientific names were used for the species. Since the late 1800s, most authorities have used the name &quot;Chelys fimbriata&quot;. In 1963, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature resolved the issue of &quot;Testudo terrestris&quot; (Fermín 1765) by declaring it a nomen oblitum (meaning that only &quot;Testudo terrestris&quot; Forsskål 1775 is valid and a synonym for the Greek tortoise), while also declaring that &quot;Chelys fimbriata&quot; is a conserved name for the mata mata.

In 1995, distinct morphological differences were found between the populations of the Amazon and Orinoco basins. In 2020, this was supported by a genetic analysis, which showed a deep split between two of its populations. The authors proposed that the mostly Orinoco population be assigned to a new species, &quot;Chelus orinocensis&quot;, with the Amazon population retaining the &quot;Chelus fimbriatus&quot;. However, &quot;Chelus fimbriatus&quot; is absent from the upper Rio Negro–Branco system (the northernmost part of the Amazon basin), which instead is inhabited by &quot;Chelus orinocensis&quot;.

==Anatomy and morphology==

The mata mata is a large, sedentary turtle with a large, triangular, flattened head with many tubercles and flaps of skin, and a &quot;spike&quot; on its long and tubular snout. Three barbels occur on the chin and four additional filamentous barbels at the upper jaw, which is neither hooked nor notched.

The mata mata&#x27;s brown or black, oblong carapace can measure up to at adult age. The full adult weight is . The mata mata&#x27;s plastron is reduced, narrowed, hingeless, shortened towards the front, and deeply notched at the rear with narrow bridges. These may be meant to allow the turtle to resemble a piece of bark, camouflaging it from possible predators. The plastron and bridges are cream to yellow or brown. The head, neck, tail, and limbs are grayish brown on adults. The neck is longer than the vertebra under its carapace and is fringed with small skin flaps along both sides. Hatchlings show a pink to reddish tinge in the underside edge of their carapaces and plastrons that gradually disappear as they grow.

Each forefoot has five webbed claws. Males have concave plastrons and longer, thicker tails than females.

==Habitat==
The mata mata inhabits slow moving streams, stagnant pools, marshes, and swamps ranging into northern Bolivia, eastern Peru, eastern Ecuador, southeastern Colombia, the eastern Guianas, and northern and central Brazil. The mata mata is strictly an aquatic species but it prefers standing in shallow water where its snout can reach the surface to breathe.

==Behavior==
The appearance of the mata mata&#x27;s shell resembles a piece of bark, and its head resembles fallen leaves. As it remains motionless in the water, its skin flaps enable it to blend into the surrounding vegetation until a fish comes close. The mata mata thrusts out its head and opens its large mouth as wide as possible, creating a low-pressure vacuum that sucks the prey into its mouth, known as suction feeding. The mata mata snaps its mouth shut, the water is slowly expelled, and the fish is swallowed whole; the mata mata cannot chew due to the way its mouth is constructed.

==Reproduction==
Males display for females by extending their limbs, lunging their heads toward the females with mouths agape, and moving the lateral flaps on their heads. Nesting occurs from October through December in the Upper Amazon. The 12 to 28 brittle, spherical, 35 mm-diameter eggs are deposited in a clutch.

==Diet==

The mata mata is carnivorous, feeding almost exclusively upon aquatic invertebrates (such as worms, mussels, crustaceans and insects) and fish. On rare occasions, it may feed on small birds, amphibians or small mammals that have entered the water. When the stomach content of 20 wild mata mata turtles was examined it consisted exclusively of small fish. The turtles predominantly feed at night in muddy water with limited visibility. However the turtle is well adapted to hunting in these conditions. The mata mata has very fine eyesight with eyes that reflect light, similar to other nocturnal reptiles. In addition, the skin flaps on the neck are also extremely sensitive and help the mata mata detect nearby movement.

Mata mata turtles use a specific method of seizing their prey. They will move the prey into shallower areas of water, surround the prey, and wave their front legs to prevent them from escaping. Once surrounded, the mata mata turtles will open their mouths and contract their pharynx, causing a rush of water that pushes the prey into their mouth.

==In captivity==

Mata mata turtles are readily available in the exotic pet trade and are quite expensive to obtain. Due to their unique appearance, they make interesting display animals. They also grow quite large. However, mata matas are not active hunters, so, like the alligator snapping turtle, they need less space than a large, active species.

As with all aquatic turtles, water quality is one of the keys to keeping this species successfully in captivity. Warm, acidic water is the best type used with a high tannin content that should be maintained all year round. Moderate to heavy filtration is recommended. Author David Fogel considers his captive mata mata turtles to be quite intelligent. For example, he has observed one turtle positioning itself near the spray bar of the aquarium at feeding time so that floating food is pushed beneath the water&#x27;s surface where the turtle can catch it more easily.

<text>Commando For Action and Adventure, formerly known as &quot;Commando War Stories in Pictures&quot;, and colloquially known as &quot;Commando Comics&quot;, is a British comic book magazine that primarily draws its themes and backdrops from the various incidents of the First and Second World Wars. It was first published in July 1961 and is still in print today. It is noted for its distinctive 7 × 5½ inch, 68 page format that became a standard for these kinds of stories. &quot;Commando&quot; has remained more popular than many other British war comics, because of its character based stories and detailed black and white artwork, with only the covers in colour. It is considered by some to be one of the greatest war comics in history.

The stories contain certain characteristic motifs; to mention a few – courage, cowardice, patriotism, dying for the sake of one&#x27;s country, noble actions, and making a cup of refreshing tea while in the face of danger, enmity turning into friendship when the going gets tough, and so on. Apart from portraying these universal qualities, &quot;Commando Comics&quot; also show soldiers in national stereotypes, glorifying Allied soldiers, but showing soldiers as a mixture of good and evil. There was usually no continuity between books; each book was a complete story with start and finish, though recently series (2 or 3 stories) of books following the same character have been published.

== Publication history ==

The comic series, then going by the title &quot;Commando War Stories in Pictures&quot;, was launched by D.C. Thomson of Dundee, Scotland, in July 1961. It was an addition to the company&#x27;s already high-profile comics, such as &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot;, as well as &quot;The Victor&quot; launched earlier that same year. During its launch year two issues were published per month, but due to the comic&#x27;s increasing popularity this rose to four a month. Since 1971 there have been eight issues published per month. As of issue 539, certain stories have been reprinted. In September 1993 the comic title changed to &quot;Commando For Action and Adventure&quot;. The last issue to feature the former title was issue 2690, &quot;Password to Freedom&quot;, published in August. The first comic to feature the new title was issue 2691, &quot;A Race Against Time&quot;, published the following month.

As well as the comics, annuals were also produced in 1989 and 1990, each containing seven new stories. The annuals were in full colour and illustrated in the style of the time, not in the original style of the comics.

At its peak in terms of sales, in one month during the 1970s, &quot;Commando&quot;&#x27;s comics circulation figures reached 750,000 according to George Low, who began working with &quot;Commando&quot; in 1963 and retired as editor in 2007. Current circulation is 9,600 copies a fortnight per issue.

Landmark Issue no 4000 of &quot;Commando&quot; – &#x27;Aces All!&#x27; – was released in April 2007. In 2011, Commando Comics celebrated their 50th anniversary of publication, having begun in 1961. They issued reprints of several of the early &quot;Commando&quot; stories from the 1960s. &quot;Commando&quot; in 2011 re-printed (in reverse order) all of the first twelve issues from 1961. Since 2007, half of &quot;Commando&quot; issues released have been re-prints of earlier stories but the remainder are new and original stories and artwork. A book celebrating the best of &quot;Commando&quot; comics cover art was released in October 2011. In 2011, new editions of &quot;Commando&quot; became available via digital download.

In June 2013, it was announced that Commando Comics, whilst still owned by D C Thomson based in Dundee, would now be printed by GGP Media in Germany.

&quot;Commando&quot; released their 5,000th issue, &#x27;Zero Hour,&#x27; in March 2017.

==Artists and writers==

&quot;Commando&quot; in its long history has employed 140 writers, over 100 cover artists &amp; 120 interior artists. These artists &amp; writers have been based in a variety of locations including the UK, Italy and Argentina. Some writers and artists who have worked on Commando include:-

*Gordon Livingstone who was one of the first artists employed by Commando when it began in 1961. His first issue was Commando No 4-&quot;Mercy for None&quot; first printed in July 1961.

==Themes and stories==

In the early years, all of &quot;Commando&quot; stories were set during the Second World War but in more recent decades, the comic has extended its range to a variety of conflicts including the First World War, the Cold War, Spanish Civil War, the Falklands, Korea, Vietnam, the Napoleonic Wars and conflicts in the medieval &amp; ancient eras. A handful of issues have also dealt with fictional conflicts such as civil wars fought between imaginary states. 

&quot;Commando&quot; has also featured stories that have crossed into other genres such as horror, supernatural and science-fiction. There were early examples that, although set in the Second World War, incorporated these alternate genres in their stories such as #808 &quot;Haunted Skies&quot; (1974), #1180 &quot;Island of Horror&quot; (1977) and #1495 &quot;Out of the Future&quot; (1981). By the 1990s, &quot;Commando&quot; was featuring such genres in settings other than WW2. One example was issue #2774 &quot;Space Watch&quot; (1994), a science-fiction adventure about spaceship battles. 

Since the mid-1970s, &quot;Commando&quot; has been also willing to portray conflicts through the viewpoint of soldiers on the opposite side. Issues such as #1350 &quot;Private Schultz&#x27;s War&quot; (1979), #2598 &quot;Let Me Fly&quot; (1992), #2713 &quot;The Flying Musketeers&quot; (1993) and #2841 &quot;Hero of the Reich&quot; (1995) portrayed World War II from the experiences of German combatants. The issue #2574-&quot;Giant Duel&quot; (1992) was a story told from the perspective of Italian combatants in WW2. Issues #922 &quot;A Question of Honour&quot; (1975) and #1168 &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; (1977) featured respectful portrayals of Japanese combatants.

The majority of Commando issues have featured self-contained single stories but a small number have featured recurring characters in a series of multiple issues. One early example were characters &quot;Tom, Dick &amp; Harry&quot; which featured in two issues released in the early 1960s. Beginning in 1991, a 5-issue series &quot;The Bomb Gang&quot; was released, featuring a group of misfits during WW2 tasked with bomb-disposal duties. Other series have included &quot;Ramsey&#x27;s Raiders&quot;, a series inspired by the exploits of the SAS in North Africa during WW2 and &quot;Log of the Lairds&quot;, a generational series about an English family-line of special agents operating in the Middle East from the Great War to Operation Desert Storm.

Despite the emphasis placed on action and adventure, the creators of &quot;Commando&quot; have placed great importance on achieving historical and technical accuracy as much as possible. The first editor of &quot;Commando&quot;, Charles Checkley, and his deputy Ian Forbes (who later became the second editor) both served in the Second World War. George Low remarked that Forbes always had a great respect for the Germans and that it was important that distinctions be made between fanatical Nazis and the ordinary German soldiers.

In 2019, Commando began publishing stories with a supernatural or horror theme around Halloween each year. The stories maintain a war theme, but have featured zombies, vampires, werewolves and ghost stories.

== Appearance and format ==

The &quot;Commando&quot; comic differs from the more widely known American comic book in that it is published in a 7 × 5½ inch, 68 page format, with some 135 panels per story, which is roughly similar to a standard 22 page US comic. Most panels have both captions and dialogue to further the plot. Sound effects are rarely if ever used. The intention is to make a &quot;Commando&quot; story easy to read and follow.

The artwork is in black and white except for the covers, with the lettering done in typewriter font. Until recently writers and artists went uncredited as usual for D.C Thomson comics, though now a small grenade icon appears on the first panel, crediting individuals with story, art and cover.

== Collected editions ==

In 2005, Carlton Books Ltd released an anthology of twelve &quot;Commando&quot; stories selected by George Low, who has edited the series since 1963. This proved a commercial success and further anthology collections have been published, some of which are themed. To date, these collections are:

Thomson have said they plan to publish more of these collections featuring stories from their back catalogue under their Heritage Comics brand.

== In other languages ==

The comics were popular in Finland, where they were known by the name &quot;Korkeajännitys&quot;, meaning &quot;high excitement&quot; - it&#x27;s a wordplay, referring to &quot;korkeajännite&quot;, which would mean &quot;high voltage&quot;. Hence the tagline: &quot;Iskee kuin miljoona volttia&quot;, meaning &quot;Strikes like a million volts&quot;. The term &quot;korkeajännitys&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist in Finnish language outside this wordplay. Special issues of Korkeajännitys based on Finnish themes have been published by Egmont Publishing since 1998. These themes include Finnish Civil War, Finnish War as well as Winter War and Continuation War.

These comics have also been published in India in Hindi, under the title &quot;Commando - Sachitra Yudh Kathayein&quot; by Gowarsons Publishers Pvt. Ltd.

== Legacy ==

In 2011–2012 the National Army Museum in London staged a major retrospective exhibition, &quot;Draw Your Weapons: The Art of Commando Comics&quot;. Between 1 October 2023 and 30 April 2024, an exhibition was held at the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum, entitled &quot;Into Battle! The Art of British War Comics&quot;, sponsored by the built environment consultancy Ridge.

Mathias Nelson from &quot;Forgotten Wars&quot; considered the comic series to be the longest-running and the best of its genre, stating, &quot;&quot;Commando Comics&quot; is one of the greatest war comics ever written, and I myself knew people who were inspired by it to actually enlist in the British military.&quot;

<text>An optical cavity, resonating cavity or optical resonator is an arrangement of mirrors or other optical elements that confines light waves similarly to how a cavity resonator confines microwaves. Optical cavities are a major component of lasers, surrounding the gain medium and providing feedback of the laser light. They are also used in optical parametric oscillators and some interferometers. Light confined in the cavity reflects multiple times, producing modes with certain resonance frequencies. Modes can be decomposed into longitudinal modes that differ only in frequency and transverse modes that have different intensity patterns across the cross section of the beam. Many types of optical cavities produce standing wave modes.
Different resonator types are distinguished by the focal lengths of the two mirrors and the distance between them. Flat mirrors are not often used because of the difficulty of aligning them to the needed precision. The geometry (resonator type) must be chosen so that the beam remains stable, i.e. the size of the beam does not continually grow with multiple reflections. Resonator types are also designed to meet other criteria such as a minimum beam waist or having no focal point (and therefore no intense light at a single point) inside the cavity.

Optical cavities are designed to have a large Q factor, meaning a beam undergoes many oscillation cycles with little attenuation. In the regime of high Q values, this is equivalent to the frequency line width being small compared to the resonant frequency of the cavity.

==Resonator modes==
Light confined in a resonator will reflect multiple times from the mirrors, and due to the effects of interference, only certain patterns and frequencies of radiation will be sustained by the resonator, with the others being suppressed by destructive interference. In general, radiation patterns which are reproduced on every round-trip of the light through the resonator are the most stable. These are known as the &quot;modes&quot; of the resonator.

Resonator modes can be divided into two types: longitudinal modes, which differ in frequency from each other; and transverse modes, which may differ in both frequency and the intensity pattern of the light. The basic, or fundamental transverse mode of a resonator is a Gaussian beam.

==Resonator types==
The most common types of optical cavities consist of two facing plane (flat) or spherical mirrors. The simplest of these is the plane-parallel or Fabry–Pérot cavity, consisting of two opposing flat mirrors. While simple, this arrangement is rarely used in large-scale lasers due to the difficulty of alignment; the mirrors must be aligned parallel within a few seconds of arc, or &quot;walkoff&quot; of the intracavity beam will result in it spilling out of the sides of the cavity. However, this problem is much reduced for very short cavities with a small mirror separation distance (&quot;L&quot; &lt; 1 cm). Plane-parallel resonators are therefore commonly used in microchip and microcavity lasers and semiconductor lasers. In these cases, rather than using separate mirrors, a reflective optical coating may be directly applied to the laser medium itself. The plane-parallel resonator is also the basis of the Fabry–Pérot interferometer.

For a resonator with two mirrors with radii of curvature &quot;R&quot;1 and &quot;R&quot;2, there are a number of common cavity configurations. If the two radii are equal to half the cavity length (&quot;R&quot;1 = &quot;R&quot;2 = &quot;L&quot; /2), a concentric or spherical resonator results. This type of cavity produces a diffraction-limited beam waist in the centre of the cavity, with large beam diameters at the mirrors, filling the whole mirror aperture. Similar to this is the hemispherical cavity, with one plane mirror and one mirror of radius equal to the cavity length.

A common and important design is the confocal resonator, with mirrors of equal radii to the cavity length (&quot;R&quot;1 = &quot;R&quot;2 = &quot;L&quot;). This design produces the smallest possible beam diameter at the cavity mirrors for a given cavity length, and is often used in lasers where the purity of the transverse mode pattern is important.

A concave-convex cavity has one convex mirror with a negative radius of curvature. This design produces no intracavity focus of the beam, and is thus useful in very high-power lasers where the intensity of the light might be damaging to the intracavity medium if brought to a focus.

Less common resonator types include optical ring resonators and whispering-gallery mode resonators, in which a resonance is formed by waves moving in a closed loop rather than reflecting between two mirrors.

==Stability==
Only certain ranges of values for &quot;R&quot;1, &quot;R&quot;2, and &quot;L&quot; produce stable resonators in which periodic refocussing of the intracavity beam is produced. If the cavity is unstable, the beam size will grow without limit, eventually growing larger than the size of the cavity mirrors and being lost. By using methods such as ray transfer matrix analysis, it is possible to calculate a stability criterion:

:formula_1
Values which satisfy the inequality correspond to stable resonators.

The stability can be shown graphically by defining a stability parameter, &quot;g&quot; for each mirror:
:formula_2,
and plotting &quot;g&quot;1 against &quot;g&quot;2 as shown. Areas bounded by the line &quot;g&quot;1 &quot;g&quot;2 = 1 and the axes are stable. Cavities at points exactly on the line are marginally stable; small variations in cavity length can cause the resonator to become unstable, and so lasers using these cavities are in practice often operated just inside the stability line.

A simple geometric statement describes the regions of stability: A cavity is stable if the line segments between the mirrors and their centers of curvature overlap, but one does not lie entirely within the other.

In the confocal cavity, if a ray is deviated from its original direction in the middle of the cavity, its displacement after reflecting from one of the mirrors is larger than in any other cavity design. This prevents amplified spontaneous emission and is important for designing high power amplifiers with good beam quality.

==Practical resonators==
If the optical cavity is not empty (e.g., a laser cavity which contains the gain medium), the value of &quot;L&quot; needs to be adjusted to account for the index of refraction of the medium. Optical elements such as lenses placed in the cavity alter the stability and mode size. In addition, for most gain media, thermal and other inhomogeneities create a variable lensing effect in the medium, which must be considered in the design of the laser resonator.

Practical laser resonators may contain more than two mirrors; three- and four-mirror arrangements are common, producing a &quot;folded cavity&quot;. Commonly, a pair of curved mirrors form one or more confocal sections, with the rest of the cavity being quasi-collimated and using plane mirrors. The shape of the laser beam depends on the type of resonator: The beam produced by stable, paraxial resonators can be well modeled by a Gaussian beam. In special cases the beam can be described as a single transverse mode and the spatial properties can be well described by the Gaussian beam, itself. More generally, this beam may be described as a superposition of transverse modes. Accurate description of such a beam involves expansion over some complete, orthogonal set of functions (over two-dimensions) such as Hermite polynomials or the Ince polynomials. Unstable laser resonators on the other hand, have been shown to produce fractal shaped beams.

Some intracavity elements are usually placed at a beam waist between folded sections. Examples include acousto-optic modulators for cavity dumping and vacuum spatial filters for transverse mode control. For some low power lasers, the laser gain medium itself may be positioned at a beam waist. Other elements, such as filters, prisms and diffraction gratings often need large quasi-collimated beams.

These designs allow compensation of the cavity beam&#x27;s astigmatism, which is produced by Brewster-cut elements in the cavity. A Z-shaped arrangement of the cavity also compensates for coma while the &#x27;delta&#x27; or X-shaped cavity does not.

Out of plane resonators lead to rotation of the beam profile and more stability. The heat generated in the gain medium leads to frequency drift of the cavity, therefore the frequency can be actively stabilized by locking it to unpowered cavity. Similarly the pointing stability of a laser may still be improved by spatial filtering by an optical fibre.

=== Alignment ===

Precise alignment is important when assembling an optical cavity. For best output power and beam quality, optical elements must be aligned such that the path followed by the beam is centered through each element.

Simple cavities are often aligned with an alignment laser—a well-collimated visible laser that can be directed along the axis of the cavity. Observation of the path of the beam and its reflections from various optical elements allows the elements&#x27; positions and tilts to be adjusted.

More complex cavities may be aligned using devices such as electronic autocollimators and laser beam profilers.

==Optical delay lines==
Optical cavities can also be used as multipass optical delay lines, folding a light beam so that a long path-length may be achieved in a small space. A plane-parallel cavity with flat mirrors produces a flat zigzag light path, but as discussed above, these designs are very sensitive to mechanical disturbances and walk-off. When curved mirrors are used in a nearly confocal configuration, the beam travels on a circular zigzag path. The latter is called a Herriott-type delay line. A fixed insertion mirror is placed off-axis near one of the curved mirrors, and a mobile pickup mirror is similarly placed near the other curved mirror. A flat linear stage with one pickup mirror is used in case of flat mirrors and a rotational stage with two mirrors is used for the Herriott-type delay line.

The rotation of the beam inside the cavity alters the polarization state of the beam. To compensate for this, a single pass delay line is also needed, made of either a three or two mirrors in a 3d respective 2d retro-reflection configuration on top of a linear stage. To adjust for beam divergence a second car on the linear stage with two lenses can be used. The two lenses act as a telescope producing a flat phase front of a Gaussian beam on a virtual end mirror.

<text>Telebit Corporation was a US-based modem manufacturer, known for their TrailBlazer series of high-speed modems. One of the first modems to routinely exceed 9600 bit/s speeds, the TrailBlazer used a proprietary modulation scheme that proved highly resilient to interference, earning the product an almost legendary reputation for reliability despite mediocre (or worse) line quality. They were particularly common in Unix installations in the 1980s and 1990s.

The high price of the Telebit modems was initially not a concern as their performance was equally high compared to other systems. However, as new designs using V.32 and V.32bis began to arrive in the early 1990s, Telebit&#x27;s price/performance ratio was seriously eroded. A series of new designs followed, but these never regained their performance lead. By the mid-1990s the company had been part of a series of mergers and eventually disappeared in 1998 after being acquired by Digi International.

==Startup==

Telebit was founded by Paul Baran, one of the inventors of the packet switching networking concept. Baran had recently started a networking company known as Packet Technologies on Bubb Road in Cupertino, California, which was working on systems for interactive television. While working there, he hit on the idea for a new way to implement high-speed modems, and started Telebit across the street. Packet Technologies was a major beta customer for Telebit in late 1985. Packet Technologies later failed, and several of their employees were folded into Telebit, while most of the others formed StrataCom, makers of the first Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches.

==PEP and the TrailBlazer==
In contrast to then-existing ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) V-series protocols, such as the common 2400 bit/s V.22bis, the TrailBlazers&#x27; used a proprietary modulation system known as Packetized Ensemble Protocol (PEP), based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). It employed a large number (initially up to 512) of closely spaced carrier frequencies, each modulated at 6 baud, encoding 0, 2, 4 or 6 bits per interval. Under favorable conditions, the devices could reach data rates of 6 baud x 6 bits-per-baud x 512 carriers = 18432 bits per second. If a particular carrier was distorted, attenuated or interfered with, it could be turned off, allowing the data rate to degrade gracefully in steps of 10 bps with decreasing line quality.

Using a large number of carriers spread across the phone network&#x27;s bandwidth meant that the chance that any one carrier would be subject to a problem was high. In order to correct for the unavoidable errors this would cause, the Trailblazers were one of the earlier implementations of the MNP error-correcting protocols. Although these protocols added overhead, and errors caused further overhead, the combination of all of these features still provided much higher throughput than conventional designs running on the same lines. In contrast, something like a 2400 bit/s modem might suffer from a smaller number of errors in a given time, but those errors would require longer to fix through re-transmission at the slower speed. If those errors were being caused by a constant source of noise on those frequencies, PEP would simply turn those carriers off, while the 2400 bit/s modem could do nothing about this.

Most modems of the era were set up with both channels with equal speed (full duplex), or, in the case where data was primarily sent in one direction, with a single high-speed channel (half duplex). The TrailBlazer instead allowed any one of its 512 channels to be assigned to transfer data in either direction, a technique they termed &quot;adaptive duplex&quot;. The modem was designed to use most of the bandwidth in a single direction, with a relatively low-speed reverse channel. The modems at the two ends of the connection would negotiate line turnarounds, reversing the directions of the high-speed and low-speed channels, based on the amount of data queued for transmission in each modem.

While this adaptive duplex scheme was able to send large files quickly, for users accustomed to having the distant computer echo characters, the delay associated with having the digital signal processors (DSP) take turns using the bandwidth tended to make interactive typing difficult, as there could be as much as a second and a half delay for a single character echo. This also caused problems for file transfer protocols, e.g., UUCP &#x27;g&#x27; or Kermit, where a small packet of data was sent by one computer, followed by a wait for acknowledgment from the receiver (&quot;send and wait&quot;).

The TrailBlazer addressed this problem through a technique known as &quot;protocol spoofing&quot;. When the local computer sent a packet to the modem for transmission, the modem&#x27;s controller immediately sent an message, generated locally. This fooled the computer into thinking the packet had already reached the far end, prompting it to send another packet. The error correction normally being provided in the transfer protocol was instead handled using a proprietary replacement protocol operating on top of MNP. In general, spoofing offered greatly improved performance with any protocol that used small packets, and thus generated many messages; the TrailBlazers initially supported UUCP, and support for XMODEM, YMODEM, SDLC and Kermit followed.

Support for these features did not come cheaply; the TrailBlazer Plus, for instance, used a Texas Instruments TMS32010 DSP processor for the actual modulation and demodulation functions, and a Motorola 68000 for control. This meant that the TrailBlazers were significantly more expensive than most other modems. However, their speed and spoofing ability made the TrailBlazer modems extremely popular in the Unix world, as they could dramatically improve UUCP throughput, even at low connection speeds on very noisy lines. Improvements of over seven times faster than a 2400 bit/s modem were not uncommon. Sites that required long-distance telephone calls to exchange UUCP mail could pay for the price of a TrailBlazer in long-distance savings fairly quickly.

The Trailblazers also introduced an extensive set of commands for setting up its various options. While most of the simple commands were based on the Hayes command set, like dialing a number or hanging up a phone, their proprietary capabilities were supported by proprietary commands and syntax. Most of these took the form of codice_1 pairs, leading to extremely long and almost undecipherable setup strings.

In 1988 Telebit added the T1000, essentially a TrailBlazer limited to a lower-speed 9600 bit/s version of PEP, remaining compatible at that speed with existing TrailBlazers. The T2000 added support for synchronous communications, typically used between mainframe computers. The original TrailBlazer, T1000 and T2000 were backwards-compatible with the 2400 bit/s V.22bis standard, allowing them to connect with what was then the most common modem speed when talking to other brands of modems.

==NetBlazer==
Another Telebit product was the first on-demand Internet dialup router, the NetBlazer. The product was developed by a team led by Mike Ballard, formerly of Packet, who eventually became Telebit&#x27;s CEO in 1992.

The original NetBlazer was a standard PC with a serial card connected to user supplied external modems by serial cables. Later smaller versions, the PN and STi, were offered which consisted of a small-form-factor PC combined with custom software and one of a variety of modems or other connection systems (ISDN, etc.) combined into a large modem-like box. Administrators connected to it via Ethernet, which was also used for maintenance commands and setup.

In its first release the NetBlazer software supported TCP/IP using SLIP, but a later upgrade added Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and support for IPX and AppleTalk.
The protocol stack was a commercially licensed and heavily modified version of KA9Q. A later low-end model, the NetBlzer LS, switched from the Intel 80386 to the Motorola MC68EN360 SoC.

==Increasing speeds==

Telebit had their initial public offering in April 1990, which raised about $20.2 million. It traded on NASDAQ with the symbol TBIT.

The first multi-company standard for 9600 bit/s dialup modems was V.32, introduced in 1989. Initially V.32 modems were very expensive, but Rockwell aggressively attacked this market, introducing modules, and eventually entire chipsets, that brought the prices down. Telebit first offered V.32 support in the T2500, which used the Trailblazer/T2000 hardware with the addition of the Rockwell V.32 modem module. A version without PEP support was offered as the T1500. The later T1600 had basically the same feature set as the T1500, but used Telebit&#x27;s own V.32 implementation rather than the Rockwell module, resulting in reduced production cost and better performance. Both the T1500 and T1600 had list prices over $1000; at the time a 1st tier product from Hayes or U.S. Robotics (USR) generally cost about $700.

The V.32bis standard, increasing the bit rate to 14,400 bit/s, was introduced in 1991. In this case Rockwell quickly released a V.32bis chipset, appearing on the market so rapidly that Rockwell-based systems generally pre-dated implementations from dedicated modem companies. Rockwell also aggressively priced the V.32bis product line, allowing modems based on them to sell at price points around $300, the point formerly held by 2400 bit/s models that offered no error correction or compression, nor fax capabilities. All of the 1st-tier companies had serious difficulties adapting to a market that was now filled with low-cost modems with similar or better performance and features than their own high-end models.

Telebit started slipping in terms of relative performance, while still trying to sell their products at their traditional high price points. They introduced the T3000 with V.32bis but without PEP, though a PEP upgrade was announced. Instead, Telebit re-released it in early 1994 as the $1,099 WorldBlazer model; essentially a T3000 with the new 23,000 bit/s TurboPEP mode. TurboPEP used the same modulation scheme as the original PEP, but changed the encoding to allow up to 7 bits per baud. An upgrade from the T3000 to WorldBlazer was sold, consisting of two firmware ROMs and a PAL chip.

There were some design studies of a possible full-duplex PEP using echo cancellation (as is used in V.32), and this technology was proposed to the CCITT (now known as the ITU-T) for possible adoption as the V.fast modem standard. However, more conventional modem technology was chosen and standardized as V.34. Telebit deemed full-duplex PEP to require more engineering effort than was justified by the shrinking market for PEP modems, and never introduced this feature.

==The Octocom merger and the FastBlazer V.34 modem==
The CCITT moved quickly to improve on V.32bis, and by 1993 it was clear that the ratification process for their new 28,800 bit/s V.34 standard was going to be finalized in 1994. Companies lined up to start production of new V.34 designs, some going so far to introduce models based on interim standards, such as V.FC.

Telebit&#x27;s modem engineering team developed a plan for a V.34 modem, but the executive staff believed that it was important to get a product to market more quickly. To that end, they began looking for other modem companies to acquire, and in January 1993 announce that Telebit would acquire Octocom Systems, a small privately held modem company in Massachusetts. Octocom had a V.34 modem in development which was expected to be ready for shipment quickly. Almost all modem engineering activities at Telebit&#x27;s California offices ceased, though NetBlazer engineering continued to be based in California until the end of 1995.

The Telebit FastBlazer 8840 V.34 modem was introduced in May 1994. When the FastBlazer was first introduced it did not include V.34 support, with management stating that they couldn&#x27;t do so because the standard was not yet ratified. Although this was true (for one month anyway, it was ratified in June), the FastBlazer did not ship with an interim standard either; even AT&amp;T&#x27;s largely ignored 19,200 bit/s V.32terbo would only be available as a post-release upgrade in July, there were no plans to support the widespread V.FC at all, and no date was set for full V.34 support other than &quot;two or three months&quot;.

Making matters worse, the FastBlazer didn&#x27;t include fax support. While Telebit stated that an upgrade to add this would be available, they also stated they would be charging for it. Nor would the FastBlazer support PEP, which, although by then a minor consideration for most potential buyers, was still a differentiator for Telebit&#x27;s existing installed base. For sites with a Telebit modem on at least one end of a link, a PEP-capable upgrade might be worthwhile. Without PEP, the FastBlazer had essentially no advantage over any other V.34 modem.

All this for an introductory price of $1,399, when V.32bis faxmodems were available for $200 or less, and industrial-quality V.34 designs were soon available for under $500.

It took seven months before Telebit introduced V.34 support in January 1995, also releasing the $399 TeleBlazer &quot;low-end&quot; model at the same time. By this point even long-time supporters were publicly pooh-poohing the company on the Usenet, the medium that originally drove the widespread adoption of the TrailBlazer.

==Next phase==
Late in 1993 Telebit completed their merger with Octocom, the idea being to use Octocom&#x27;s Chelmsford, Massachusetts manufacturing capability headed by veteran executive Bryan Holley, as executive vice president of worldwide operations, downsizing the existing Sunnyvale office to become a NetBlazer development site under the supervision of James Norrod. The Sunnyvale facility was closed to reduce costs.
Higher than expected operating costs resulted in stagnation with the development of new products. The difficult integration of the Sunnyvale operation into the corporate Chelmsford, MA headquarters was fraught with more difficulties than those of finance and marketing. Both companies had a staunch and loyal following of customers and the surprise that the acquiring Telebit gaining Octocom would, in effect, flip around as Octocom essentially absorbing Telebit left some customers and many non-surviving post-merger employees bitter. 
By March 1996 the company had exhausted its line of credit, reducing cash by $3.2 million on revenues of $12.7 million in the quarter.

In July 1996 Telebit was acquired by Cisco Systems for $200 million, primarily for their channelized T1 digital-modem technology, modem ISDN channel aggregation (MICA). Telebit management convinced Cisco to spin off the company including all existing product families as well as a paid-up license for the use of MICA in future products developed by the spinoff to one of the existing management team (James D. Norrod) to become Telebit Incorporated and based in Chelmsford.

In August 1997 Telebit merged with ITK Telekommunikation, based in Dortmund Germany.
Telebit executive vice president Bryan Holley was named president and chief executive officer for the new ITK Telecommunications, Inc. under which leading the newly minted ITK through further M&amp;A activity culminating with the combined company being acquired in July 1998 by Digi International, makers of the DigiBoard multi-port serial card for PCs.

==Legacy==
While the Trailblazers have generally been displaced by modems implementing the higher-rate V.34/V.90 series standards, and although they have been out of production since the mid-1990s, many TrailBlazers continue to be in operation to this date, and repair services are still available.

In 1995, a Silicon Valley engineer sent a Worldblazer to an NGO in Somalia, which promptly put it to work connecting that remote country to the Internet, at first by UUCP, then by other means.
