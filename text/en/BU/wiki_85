<text>The Bristol Brigand was a British anti-shipping/ground attack/dive bomber aircraft, developed by the Bristol Aeroplane Company as a replacement for the Beaufighter. A total of 147 were built and were used by the Royal Air Force in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency and Kenya until replaced by the de Havilland Hornet in Malaya and the English Electric Canberra jet bomber elsewhere.

==Design and development==
The Bristol Type 164 was the outcome of the 1942 Air Ministry specification H.7/42 calling for a faster development of the Beaufighter for long-range torpedo work and anti-shipping strikes. The Bristol design team led by Leslie Frise used the wings, tail and undercarriage of the Buckingham with a new fuselage of oval cross-section. The pilot, navigator/bomb aimer and radio-operator/gunner were grouped in the forward cockpit. In spite of the official change in its role to a bomber, the first eleven Brigands off the production line were completed as torpedo bombers. These early aircraft served with RAF Coastal Command from 1946 to 1947 before being converted to bombers.

==Operational history==
In 1946 the first 11 production torpedo-fighter (TF.1) aircraft were delivered to 36 Squadron and 42 Squadron, RAF Coastal Command, which had no need for coastal strike aircraft at the time so the torpedo-fighters were returned to Filton and converted to light bombers (B.1). The first B.1s were delivered in 1949 to 84 Squadron at RAF Habbaniya to convert from the Beaufighter and 8 Squadron in Aden, a Hawker Tempest unit. The first unit to convert from Beaufighters to the Brigand was 45 Squadron, based at RAF Station Tengah, Singapore, operating in support of British forces against the Communist guerrillas, engaged in an insurgency in Malaya. The first Brigand was flown to Tengah from RAF St Athan in November 1949, a 16-day trip.

After test flights, the first combat operation was conducted by the Brigand, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Dalton Golding and crewed by radio/radar operator Peter Weston, together with four Beaufighters of No. 45 Squadron against CT targets in the jungle west of Kluang, Malaya on 19 December 1949. The Brigand carried three rockets, and one 500 lb (230 kg) and two 1,000 lb (450 kg) bombs. The operation was successful and No. 45 Squadron soon completed its conversion to the Brigand. Brigands of 45 Squadron and soon 84 Squadron were routinely engaged in strikes against Communist insurgent targets throughout Malaya, direct and in close support of ground forces, as well as providing air cover as needed to convoys on the ground, against possible ambushes.

Problems with the Brigand became apparent during operations in Malaya, with undercarriages failing to lower. This was traced to rubber seals in the hydraulic jacks deteriorating in the hot, humid climate. Just as this problem was being resolved another problem arose, more serious because it led to fatalities: a propensity for aircraft damage and loss during strafing runs employing the four 20 mm cannon. An accumulation of gases in the long cannon blast tubes, which ran under the cockpit, was igniting through use of high-explosive shells. This in turn severed hydraulic lines, which would burn. This was cured by drastically reducing ammunition loads and using only ball rounds. The Brigand also had a tendency to shed a propeller blade, leading to complete propeller failure; this in turn would lead to the engine being wrenched off the wing and an inevitable crash. The problem was found to be caused by corrosion in the propeller locking rings. More frequent maintenance helped alleviate this problem.

When everything was working properly the Brigand was considered by its pilots to be a good aircraft:

As the Brigand became subject to more restrictions both unit commanders had serious doubts about the continued use of the aircraft. It was decided to continue operating them, since as long as thorough maintenance was carried out it was felt that nothing else could go wrong. Another design flaw arose in the leather bellows used to deploy the air brakes during dives. In the tropical climate, the leather would rot, causing the brakes to fail. This led to Brigands losing wings in dives due to excessive airspeed or rotation as only one brake deployed. When this problem was discovered the air brakes of all Brigands were wired shut, decreasing the aircraft&#x27;s dive bombing capabilities.

No. 45 Squadron converted to de Havilland Hornets in January 1952 while 84 Squadron was disbanded in February 1953. Soon after this, the Brigands were grounded and withdrawn from service. Brigands were also used operationally over Aden by 8 Squadron from 1950 to 1952, when it was found that the Brigand mainspars were suspect; the Brigands were replaced by de Havilland Vampires. In 1950 nine Brigand T.4 radar trainers were delivered to 228 OCU at RAF Leeming to train radar navigators on the use of aircraft interception (AI) radar. A further variant with a different radar installation was Brigand T.5 which were converted from B.1s and later all the T.4s were also modified to T.5 standard. The last operator was 238 OCU at RAF North Luffenham which disbanded in March 1958.

==Variants==
The first to be built was the Brigand I or Brigand TF.1 and these entered service with RAF Coastal Command. They were subsequently rebuilt to become the Brigand B.1, notable as both the first purpose-built multi-role bomber for the RAF and its last piston-engined bomber. It could carry either a 22 in (560 mm) torpedo under the fuselage with two 500 lb (230 kg) bombs beneath the wings, one 2,000 lb (910 kg) or two 1,000 lb (450 kg) bombs beneath the fuselage and had underwing racks for 16 RP-3 60 lb (30 kg) rocket projectiles.

<doc id="606371" wikidata="Q286983" url="?curid=606371" title="Echolyn">
<text>Echolyn is an American progressive rock band based in eastern Pennsylvania.

==History==
=== Origins and first phase (1989–1995) ===
Echolyn was formed in 1989 when guitarist Brett Kull and drummer Paul Ramsey, members of a recently split cover band called Narcissus, joined with keyboardist Chris Buzby to form a new band to focus on original songs. They were soon joined by fellow Narcissus veteran Ray Weston on vocals and bassist Jesse Reyes, and quickly began playing live and recording their eponymous debut album, which was released in 1991. During the recording of that album, Reyes was replaced on bass by Tom Hyatt.

With this lineup, Echolyn recorded a second album, &quot;Suffocating the Bloom&quot;, and a four-song EP, &quot;...And Every Blossom&quot;, and with these releases attracted the attention of Sony Music. In 1994, Echolyn was signed to a multi-album deal on Sony&#x27;s Epic Records label with their major-label debut, &quot;As the World&quot;, released in March 1995.

However, the label did not provide support for the band to tour in promotion of the album, therefore the band was forced to promote &quot;As the World&quot; on their own. Later in 1995, Sony dropped Echolyn from the label due to poor sales of &quot;As the World&quot;. Disillusioned, the band split up, but an album of demos and live tracks was released in 1996 called &quot;When the Sweet Turns Sour&quot; (featuring a cover of the early Genesis track &quot;Where the Sour Turns to Sweet&quot;, which Sony refused to allow to include on a Magna Carta Genesis tribute album entitled &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;).

===Interim (1996–2000)===
Ray Weston, Brett Kull and Paul Ramsey formed a new, semi-progressive rock band called Still and released a disc called &quot;Always Almost&quot; in early 1996, on the independent Pleasant Green label. Later that year the band changed its name to Always Almost, releasing a much more progressive-oriented album entitled &quot;God Pounds His Nails&quot;, also on Pleasant Green. Over a two-year period they played many shows in the Philadelphia area and Baltimore, as well as two shows in Atlanta and Athens, Georgia.

Ray Weston joined progressive rock band The Dark Aether Project in 1998. Over the next two years he toured with the group and appeared on the 1999 album &quot;Feed the Silence&quot;.

Chris Buzby formed a jazz-influenced progressive rock band called Finneus Gauge with guitarist Scott McGill, bass player Chris Eike, vocalist Laura Martin, and drummer Jonn Buzby. They released two albums, &quot;More Once More&quot; (1996) and &quot;One Inch of the Fall&quot; (1998).

It was during this time that Echolyn were asked by Magna Carta Records to contribute to a Jethro Tull tribute album. Weston, Kull, and Ramsey (who owned the &quot;Echolyn&quot; trademark name) chose &quot;One Brown Mouse&quot;, recorded the song, and the album &quot;To Cry You a Song: A Collection of Tull Tales&quot; was released on July 2, 1996.

===Second phase (2000–2017)===

Echolyn formally reformed – without Tom Hyatt – in the spring of 2000. Ray Weston took over bass duties and new member Jordan Perlson (a Berklee College of Music graduate and former student of Buzby) supplemented Ramsey on drums and percussion. This lineup produced the 2000 album &quot;Cowboy Poems Free&quot;, a loose concept album centering on Americana, and the 2002 album &quot;mei&quot;, which contains only a single, 50-minute-long track.

After playing as a guest with the band in 2002 and early 2003, including their first appearance at the North East Art Rock Festival in June 2002, Tom Hyatt officially rejoined Echolyn. The first album from the fully reformed lineup was &quot;The End Is Beautiful&quot;, released in September 2005. Subsequently, the band embarked on their first European tour. They also contributed a new track called &quot;15 Days&quot; to the benefit album &quot;After the Storm&quot; (NEARfest Records), in support of the survivors of the Hurricane Katrina disaster. The band was later featured at the inaugural Festival des Musiques Progressives de Montréal in Quebec, Canada, in September 2006.

2008 saw the release of a newly remastered &quot;Cowboy Poems Free&quot; as well as solo work from Brett Kull and a second performance at NEARfest. Echolyn continued to tour sporadically through 2009.

On June 19, 2012, Echolyn released a new album. It was untitled but referred to informally by the band as just &#x27;echolyn&#x27; or &#x27;Window&#x27; and sold as both a double CD and as a limited edition two-disc vinyl release (500 copies). Subsequently, the band released seven additional tracks through Bandcamp,&gt; including a live track, a remix of &quot;15 Days&quot;, outtakes from the album such as &quot;Accumulated Blur&quot;, &quot;Moments with No Sound&quot;, and other songs written in the same period as the album but not completed in time, including &quot;Crows Fly By&quot; and &quot;Another Stone&quot;.

On July 1, 2015, Echolyn opened up a two-week pre-sales window for their eighth studio album, &quot;I Heard You Listening&quot;, with a public release date of July 31, 2015. Initial reviews of the album were extremely positive. The album was given its debut on the ProgScape Radio Internet radio program on July 15, 2015.

===Third phase (2018–present)===
In early 2018, Chris Buzby, Brett Kull, and Ray Weston began writing sessions for a new Echolyn album. These sessions continued over the next two years with updates posted to the band&#x27;s official Facebook page from time to time. The short videos feature the band playing parts of some of the new songs on which they had been working.

==Musical style==
The members of Echolyn have cited Rush, Genesis, Wilco, Gentle Giant, Yes, Steely Dan, Jethro Tull, Igor Stravinsky, Electric Light Orchestra, and The Beatles as influences.

While the band&#x27;s style has varied over the years, those influences have been consistently reflected in their music. Intricate guitar leads, unorthodox harmonic structures influenced by modern classical music, and complex contrapuntal vocal passages have remained significant aspects of the musical sound of Echolyn.

The albums they recorded before their 1996 breakup sounded more like &quot;classic&quot; progressive rock, with layered keyboards and extended arrangements. Following their reformation, they have streamlined their style significantly, emphasizing strong, tightly constructed songwriting and more prominent rhythmic grooves, while maintaining much of the subtle sophistication that has caused their music to be labeled &quot;progressive.&quot;

Their self-titled 2012 double album features extended arrangements, rhythmic complexity and integration of the symphonic, &quot;retro&quot; progressive rock sound heard in their earlier works, while also referencing American styles such as country and blues.

<doc id="606386" wikidata="Q1361255" url="?curid=606386" title="Yamanami Keisuke">
<text>was a Japanese samurai. He was the General Commander (総長, Sōchō) of the Shinsengumi, a special police force in Kyoto during the late Edo period.

==Background==
Though the details of his origin are unclear, he was thought to be the son of a kenjutsu instructor originated from the Sendai domain.

Yamanami was trained under Chiba Shusaku Narimasa, the founder of the &quot;Hokushin Itto-ryu&quot;, and attained &quot;Menkyo Kaiden&quot; (&quot;license of total transmission&quot;) sometime before 1860.

In 1860 after Yamanami was defeated by Kondō Isami in a match, he was enrolled at the &quot;Tennen Rishin-ryū&quot;&#x27;s Shieikan dojo in Edo (which was run by Kondō from 1861.) Yamanami was particularly educated in literary and military arts, with a gentle personality and a kind heart. He was very much admired by the Head Instructor (Jukutou) at the Shieikan, Okita Sōjirō (the later Okita Sōji), who called him a big brother. In 1863, Yamanami, Kondo, and other members of the Shieikan joined the Rōshigumi, the military unit being sent to Kyoto by the Tokugawa Shogunate.

==Shinsengumi Period==
In Kyoto, Kondō and his &quot;faction&quot; remained in Kyoto while the rest of the Rōshigumi returned to Edo. Soon, the Mibu Rōshigumi (which would eventually become known as the Shinsengumi) was formed. Yamanami served as a vice-commander, alongside Hijikata Toshizō after Niimi Nishiki was demoted for instigating a vicious street brawl with sumo wrestlers in Kyoto.

Yamanami was said to be one of the Shieikan members involved in the Serizawa Kamo assassination in 1863. After the purge of the Serizawa faction, Yamanami became one of two vice-commanders (the other being Hijikata).

Yamanami did not take part in the famed Ikedaya incident in 1864, instead he guarded the group&#x27;s headquarters.

==Death==
Some time after the Zenzaiya incident he tried to escape the Shinsengumi, despite the regulation against deserters. As a result, he committed seppuku with Okita as his kaishakunin on March 20 (lunar calendar February 23), 1865. There are several speculations on Yamanami&#x27;s reason to escape, including a theory that Yamanami committed suicide without ever leaving the Shinsengumi. Another theory is Yamanami lost hope about Shogunate&#x27;s future and was disillusioned about the political decisions of Tokugawa Yoshinobu, but when forced to choose between his friends and justice, he decided to commit an honorable suicide and escape scandal.

In &quot;Shinsengumi: The Shogun&#x27;s Last Samurai Corps&quot; by Romulus Hillsborough, reference is made to the possibility of Yamanami having escaped:

&quot;The trouble with Yamanami seems to have originated over a disagreement in philosophy, though Shimosawa also cites a bitter rivalry with the other vice commander, Hijikata Toshizo. Yamanami was apparently vexed over the lately inflated self-importance of Kondo and Hijikata. He felt that they had forgotten the original purpose for which the members of the Shieikan had enlisted in the &quot;loyal and patriotic&quot; corps. The unyielding will to power that had lately consumed his erstwhile friends had diminished their former patriotic ideals. According to most sources, Yamanami&#x27;s vexation was exacerbated sometime early in 1865, when Kondo and Hijikata, unhappy with their cramped headquarters at Mibu, decided to move to a more spacious location at Nishihonganji Temple in the southwest of the city. The temple priests were perplexed over the decision. Their attempts to rebuff the Shinsengumi were ignored by Kondo and Hijikata. Yamanami objected to what he considered coercion of Buddhist priests. &quot;Certainly there are many other suitable places,&quot; he admonished Kondo, and suggested that his commander reconsider. But his commander would not reconsider, and Yamanami resolved to pay the ultimate price. He composed a farewell letter explaining the reasons he could no longer, in good conscience, risk his life under Kondo&#x27;s command. Then he defected.&quot;

This is the most accepted theory in regard of Yamanami&#x27;s reason to leave the Shinsengumi, through his true reasons remain a mystery. In addition, Hillsborough&#x27;s theorizing of a rivalry between Yamanami and Hijikata in Shimosawa Kan&#x27;s &quot;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&quot; is categorized as historical fiction.

Yamanami fled to Otsu, and Kondo sent Okita to retrieve him. After Yamanami returned to Mibu, he was ordered to commit seppuku. He asked Okita to serve as his second, or kaishakunin. There is also a theory that Kondo asked Okita to serve as Yamanami&#x27;s second out of respect for Yamanami. (The second was usually a close friend or family member.) Yamanami saw Okita as family, and the two shared a strong bond till the very end of Yamanami&#x27;s life.

Yamanami was buried at the in Kyoto.

Before his death, Yamanami was the second-in-command of the Shinsengumi. (It is a misconception that Hijikata had always been the second-in-command. In fact, Hijikata became the second-in-command after Yamanami&#x27;s death.)

<text>The Bristol Type 163 Buckingham was a British Second World War medium bomber for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Overtaken by events, it was built in small numbers and was used primarily for transport and liaison duties.

==Design and development==
In early 1939 Bristol suggested a bomber variant of the Beaufighter with their Hercules engines. British policy at the time was for medium bombers to be obtained from the US allowing British industry to concentrate on heavy bomber designs; nonetheless a design was requested preferably based on an existing aircraft. This meant working with the Beaufighter or Beaufort. Bristol worked on their design first as the Bristol Type 161 then the Type 162 Beaumont.

Air Ministry specification B.7/40 called for a medium bomber to replace the Blenheim. The specification stipulated a speed of at least 300 mph at 5,000 ft, a normal load of 1,000 lb of bombs and a centre turret armed with at least two 0.5 inch (12.7 mm) machine guns. Only one manufacturer (Armstrong Whitworth) tendered a full design but it did not meet with approval. So when Bristol brought their Type 162 (&quot;tentatively named Beaumont&quot;), which was well matched to B.7/40, to the Air Staff, the company received a request to complete a mockup in 1940 and then a confirmed contract for three prototypes in February 1941. The Beaumont was based on the rear fuselage and tail of a Beaufighter, with a new centre and front fuselage. The armament was a mid-upper turret with four machine guns, with four more machine guns firing forward and two firing to the rear.

Construction began in late 1940, with a new Air Ministry Specification B.2/41 to be written around it. Changes in the requirements, removing dive bombing and &quot;direct army support&quot; which incoming US bombers were expected to be capable of and increasing the performance to allow for the future, meant the Beaumont would no longer suffice. The changes in performance (requiring a bomb load of 4,000 lb, a speed of 360 mph and a range of 1,600 miles) meant a redesign by Bristol to use the Bristol Centaurus engine.

The Bristol redesign with a larger wing and the more powerful engines was the Type 163 Buckingham. It had gun installations in the nose, dorsal and ventral turrets. Generally conventional in appearance, one unusual feature was that the bomb-aimer/navigator was housed in a mid-fuselage ventral gondola, resembling those on the earlier German Heinkel He 111H and American Boeing B-17C and -D in appearance. This was part of an attempt to give all the crew positions unobstructed views and access to each other&#x27;s positions. The bomb bay could hold a 4,000 lb, two 2,000 lb, four 1,000 lb or six 500-lb bombs. The rear of the gondola had a hydraulically powered turret with two 0.303 Browning machine guns. The Bristol-designed dorsal turret carried four Brownings. A further four fixed, forward-firing Brownings were controlled by the pilot. Following more changes, specification B.2/41 was replaced by B.P/41. An order for 400, at an initial rate of 25 per month, was made with deliveries expected in March 1943 but Bristol were still concerned that this not a reasonable scale and would prove expensive, and as such complained to MAP about poor planning. The first flight took place on 4 February 1943. During testing, the Buckingham exhibited poor stability which led to the enlargement of the twin fins, along with other modifications.

==Operational history==

By the time the design entered production, requirements had changed, with attacks against German industry being covered by the US by day and by RAF Bomber Command de Havilland Mosquitos by night. The Buckingham was not considered suitable for unescorted daytime use over Europe and in January 1944, it was decided that all Buckinghams would be sent overseas to replace Vickers Wellingtons.

Once the Buckingham&#x27;s handling problems were revealed, it was realised that the type was of little use. As a result, it was cancelled in August 1944. To keep the Bristol workforce together, for later production of the Brigand and the Hawker Tempest, a batch of 119 were built. Uses for the aircraft were sought and a conversion to a communications aircraft was devised.

After the first 54 had been built as bombers, the remainder were converted for high-speed courier duties with RAF Transport Command. The gun installations were removed and four seats and windows fitted in the fuselage. The aircraft was named Buckingham C.1. Despite its 300 mph (480 km/h) speed and superior range to the Mosquito transports, with room for only four passengers, the Buckingham was rarely put to use. A total of 65 Buckingham bombers were unfinished on the production line and ended up being rebuilt as the Buckmaster, a trainer for the similar Brigand. Considered the &quot;highest performance trainer in the RAF,&quot; the Buckmaster continued to serve as a trainer until its retirement in the mid-1950s.

<text>In 3D computer graphics, a lathed object is a 3D model whose vertex geometry is produced by rotating the points of a spline or other point set around a fixed axis. The lathing may be partial; the amount of rotation is not necessarily a full 360 degrees. The point set providing the initial source data can be thought of as a cross section through the object along a plane containing its axis of radial symmetry.

The reason the lathe has this name is because it creates symmetrical objects around a rotational axis, just like a real lathe would.

Lathes are very similar to surfaces of revolution. However, lathes are constructed by rotating a curve defined by a set of points instead of a function. Note that this means that lathes can be constructed by rotating closed curves or curves that double back on themselves (such as the aforementioned torus), whereas a surface of revolution could not because such curves cannot be described by functions.

<text>&quot;Petrol&quot; is a song by Northern Irish rock band Ash, released as the second single from their 1994 mini-album, &quot;Trailer&quot;, and as their first single on Infectious Records. It was released on 15 August 1994 on CD and 7-inch vinyl format. Only 500 copies of the 7-inch format were released and came with a numbered picture sleeve. The song reached number 96 on the UK Singles Chart in 1994, becoming their first single to reach the UK top 100.

&quot;Petrol&quot; was first recorded on the &quot;Garage Girl&quot; demo tape and later appeared on Ash&#x27;s debut live album, &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot;, and again on Ash&#x27;s first greatest hits collection, &quot;Intergalactic Sonic 7″s&quot;. The song is said to be about being &quot;lynched&quot; by a gang.

==B-sides==
B-side &quot;The Little Pond&quot; first appeared on the &quot;Garage Girl&quot; demo-tape. Tim Wheeler has expressed his dissatisfaction with this recording, and has even mentioned re-recording it as an acoustic B-side on a future album. The second B-side, &quot;A Message from Oscar Wilde and Patrick the Brewer&quot;, is a spoken-word track, lasting just 30 seconds and consisting of an excerpt of a tape Wheeler was sent of two of his Dutch friends, Oscar and Patrick, talking to each other. This track also appears on the &quot;Cosmic Debris&quot; B-sides collection and on Ash&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Trailer&quot;. The third B-side, &quot;Things&quot;, first appeared on the &quot;Shed&quot; demo tape. Ash bassist Mark Hamilton claims that &quot;Things&quot; is his least favourite Ash song of all time.

<doc id="606404" wikidata="Q738719" url="?curid=606404" title="Paris–Le Bourget Airport">
<text>Paris–Le Bourget Airport () is an airport located within portions of the communes of Le Bourget, Bonneuil-en-France, Dugny and Gonesse, north-northeast of Paris, France.

Once Paris&#x27;s principal airport, it is now used only for general aviation, including business jet operations. It also hosts air shows, most notably the Paris Air Show. The airport is operated by Groupe ADP under the brand Paris Aéroport.

==History==
The airport started commercial operations in 1919 and was Paris&#x27;s only airport until the construction of Orly Airport in 1932. It is famous as the landing site for Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s historic solo transatlantic crossing in 1927 in the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, and had been the departure point two weeks earlier for the French biplane &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird)&quot;, which took off in an attempt at a transatlantic flight, but then mysteriously disappeared. Howard Hughes flew the second nonstop flight from New York to Paris in 1939, landing at Le Bourget and thereafter continuing onward to Moscow.

On 25 June 1940, Adolf Hitler began his first and only tour of Paris, with Albert Speer and an entourage, from Le Bourget Airport.

Due to capacity constraints at Le Bourget, Air France transferred all of its operations to Orly in 1952.

The Paris Air Show was first held at Le Bourget in 1953, having previously been held at the Grand Palais prior to World War II, and at Orly after the war.

The first jet-powered transcontinental flight, which was a Boeing 707 operated by Pan Am, occurred from Idlewild Airport, New York, to Le Bourget, on October 26, 1958, with a fuel stop in Gander, Newfoundland.

On 16 June 1961, the Soviet ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev defected at Le Bourget Airport.

In 1977, Le Bourget was closed to international airline traffic and in 1980 to regional airline traffic, but continues serving both domestic and international business aviation. Since 1975, Le Bourget Airport has hosted the Musée de l’air et de l’espace, France&#x27;s main state-owned aviation museum. Following the discontinuation of regular commercial traffic in 1977, space available to house museum collections and displays has progressively increased.

The airport hosts a statue commemorating Frenchwoman Raymonde de Laroche who was the first woman to earn a pilot&#x27;s licence. There is also a monument honouring Lindbergh, as well as Nungesser and Coli, pilots of &quot;The White Bird&quot;.

On 14 April 2016, the Groupe ADP rolled out the &quot;Connect 2020&quot; corporate strategy and the commercial brand Paris Aéroport was applied to all Parisian airports, including Le Bourget airport.

Le Bourget has been called &quot;The Teterboro of Europe&quot; because of the role it plays in accepting all the business aviation flying into Paris, and the support base.

==Facilities==
The Bureau d&#x27;Enquêtes et d&#x27;Analyses pour la Sécurité de l&#x27;Aviation Civile (BEA) is headquartered in Building 153 on the grounds of Le Bourget Airport and in Le Bourget. Le Bourget Airport hosts the Musée de l’air et de l’espace, which is also located in the commune of Le Bourget.

==In popular culture==
*Le Bourget Airport is the base for the Paris Air Show.
*Le Bourget Airport features in the opening sequence of The Protectors episode &quot;Your Witness&quot;
*La Bourget features heavily in Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1935 novel, &quot;Death in the Clouds&quot;.
*The titular aircraft in &quot;Airport &#x27;79: Concorde&quot; had suffered hydraulic failure during the attack by the rogue F-4 Phantom jet and barreled through two arresting barricades, being stopped, just barely, by the third.
*Le Bourget Airport appears in dozens of movies (since the 1930s), sometimes as an active airport others as the Air and Space Museum or through their collection of survivors commercial aircraft used as a set. The terminal could be heavily digitally modified (&quot;Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris&quot;), acting as an airport in East Berlin (&quot;Enigma (1982 film)&quot;) but sometimes suggested and represented by other platforms (as seen in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; -the real one being Brighton City Airport-).

<text>A lathe (; Old English: &quot;lǽð&quot;; Latin: &quot;lestus&quot;) formed an administrative country subdivision of the county of Kent, England, from the Anglo-Saxon period, until it fell out of general practical use in the early twentieth century.

Etymologically, the word &quot;lathe&quot; may derive from a Proto-Germanic root meaning &quot;land&quot; or &quot;landed possession&quot;, possibly cognate with the Greek λᾰ́τρον (&quot;latron&quot;, &quot;payment&quot;).

==List==
By the late eleventh century the traditional area of West Kent comprised three lathes: 

* Lathe of Aylesford
* Lathe of Milton
* Lathe of Sutton
while East Kent comprised four lathes: 
* Lathe of Borough
* Lathe of Eastry
* Lathe of Lympne
* Lathe of Wye

Of these, Sutton-at-Hone and Milton sometimes ranked as half-lathes.

In the thirteenth century Kent had a total of five lathes:
* the lathes of Borough and Eastry merged to form the Lathe of St. Augustine
* the lathe of Lympne underwent a name-change to become the Lathe of Shepway
* the lathes Milton and Wye merged to form the Lathe of Scray
* the Lathe of Aylesford survived unchanged.

==History==
The lathe was an ancient division of Kent and originated, probably in the 6th century, during the Jutish colonisation of the county. There exists a widespread belief that lathes originally formed around the royal settlements of the Kingdom of Kent. By the late Anglo-Saxon period they seem to have become purely administrative units, each of which contained several hundreds.

The lathe was an important administrative, judicial and taxation unit for 600 years after the Domesday Book of 1086. The functions of lathe and hundreds were somewhat similar, with a lathe covering a much wider area. Although never formally abolished, they have no administrative functions today. The Sheriff toured the county twice yearly attending on the lathes, in the case of Sutton at Hone, possibly at Shire Hall. The lathe was responsible for the raising of aids and subsidies for the Militia. However the lathe court became anomalous as it fell between the hundredal courts below and the justices of the county (in petty and quarter sessions) above.

The lathe and division of the lathe were the basis for meetings of local justices of the peace in monthly or petty sessions. These were established on a regular footing at a particularly early date in Kent. Lambarde in his &quot;Perambulation of Kent&quot; (1576) gives the &quot;Distribution of the Shyre for Execution of Justice&quot;. Sutton at Hone and St Augustine were each divided into two divisions and Aylesford into three. In an exception to this scheme, a group of hundreds in the middle of the Lathe of Scray, centred on Ashford, were for convenience attached to the Lathe of Shepway for petty sessional purposes. Also the Corporation of Romney Marsh in this lathe possessed its own quarter and petty sessions (separate from the county). From time to time existing divisions were split for sake of convenience and in 1857 the provisions of the act of 9 Geo. 4 were invoked to re-examine the whole structure.

Although not formally abolished, hundreds and lathes fell out of usage at the end of the 19th century, with, for example, the Lathe of Sutton last being used as a unit in the London Gazette, the newspaper for governmental orders, as late as 1899. However Shepway reappeared as a principal local government division of Kent in 1974, within roughly the same area as previously; the name was abandoned in 2018 in favour of Folkestone and Hythe.

The area of each lathe in 1831 was as follows:

<text>The Underwater Demolition Team (UDT), or frogmen, were amphibious units created by the United States Navy during World War II with specialized missions. They were predecessors of the Navy&#x27;s current SEAL teams.

Their primary WWII function began with reconnaissance and underwater demolition of natural or man-made obstacles obstructing amphibious landings. Postwar they transitioned to scuba gear changing their capabilities. With that they came to be considered more elite and tactical during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. UDTs were pioneers in underwater demolition, closed-circuit diving, combat swimming, riverine warfare and midget submarine (dry and wet submersible) operations. They later were tasked with ensuring recovery of space capsules and astronauts after splash down in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space flight programs. Commando training was added making them the forerunner to the United States Navy SEAL program that exists today.

By 1983, the UDTs were re-designated as SEAL Teams or Swimmer Delivery Vehicle Teams (SDVTs); however, some UDTs, had already been re-designated into UCTs and special boat units prior. SDVTs have since been re-designated SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams.

== Early history ==
The United States Navy studied the problems encountered by the disastrous Allied amphibious landings during the Gallipoli Campaign of World War I. This contributed to the development and experimentation of new landing techniques in the mid-1930s. In August 1941, landing trials were performed and one hazardous operation led to Army Second Lieutenant Lloyd E. Peddicord being assigned the task of analyzing the need for a human intelligence (HUMINT) capability.

When the U.S. entered World War II, the Navy realized that in order to strike at the Axis powers the U.S. forces would need to perform a large number of amphibious attacks. The Navy decided that men would have to go in to reconnoiter the landing beaches, locate obstacles and defenses, as well as guide the landing forces ashore. In August 1942, Peddicord set up a recon school for his new unit, Navy Scouts and Raiders, at the amphibious training base at Little Creek, Virginia.

In 1942, the Army and Navy jointly established the Amphibious Scout and Raider School at Fort Pierce, Florida. Here Lieutenant Commander Phil H. Bucklew, the &quot;Father of Naval Special Warfare&quot;, helped organize and train what became the Navy&#x27;s &#x27;first group&#x27; to specialize in amphibious raids and tactics.

The need for intelligence gathering prior to landings became paramount following the amphibious assault at the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943. Although Navy and Marine Corps planners had identified coral as an issue, they incorrectly assumed landing craft would be able to crawl over the coral. Marines were forced to exit their craft in chest deep water a thousand yards from shore, with many men drowning due to the irregularities of the reefs and Japanese gunners inflicting heavy U.S. casualties.

After that experience, Rear Admiral Kelley Turner, Commander of the V Amphibious Corps (VAC), directed Seabee Lt. Crist (CEC) to come up with a means to deal with the coral and the men to do it. Lt. Crist staged 30 officers and 150 enlisted men from the 7th Naval Construction Regiment at Waipio Amphibious Operating Base on Oahu to form the nucleus of a reconnaissance and demolition training program. It is here that the UDTs of the Pacific were born.

Later in war, the Army Engineers passed down demolition jobs to the U.S. Navy. It then became the Navy&#x27;s responsibility to clear any obstacles and defenses in the near shore area.

A memorial to the founding of the UDT has been built at Bellows Air Force Station near the original Amphibious Training Base (ATB) in Oahu.

==Naval Combat Demolition Units==

In early May 1943, a two-phase &quot;Naval Demolition Project&quot; was ordered by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) &quot;to meet a present and urgent requirement&quot;. The first phase began at Amphibious Training Base (ATB) Solomons, Maryland with the establishment of Operational Naval Demolition Unit No. 1. Six Officers and eighteen enlisted men reported from the Seabees dynamiting and demolition school at Camp Peary for a four-week course. Those Seabees were immediately sent to participate in the invasion of Sicily where they were divided in three groups that landed on the beaches near Licata, Gela and Scoglitti.

Also in May, the Navy created Naval Combat Demolition Units (NCDUs) tasked with eliminating beach obstructions in advance of amphibious assaults, going ashore in an LCRS inflatable boat. Each NCDU consisted of five enlisted men led by a single, junior (CEC) officer. In early May, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Ernest J. King, picked Lieutenant Commander Draper L. Kauffman to lead the training. The first six classes graduated from &quot;Area E&quot; at the Seabee&#x27;s Camp Peary between May and mid-July. Training was moved to Fort Pierce, Florida, where the first class began mid-July 1943. Despite the move and having the Scouts Raiders base close by, Camp Peary was Kauffman&#x27;s primary source of recruits. &quot;He would go up to Camp Peary&#x27;s Dynamite School and assemble the Seabees in the auditorium saying: &quot;I need volunteers for hazardous, prolonged and distant duty.&quot; Kauffman&#x27;s other volunteers came from the U.S. Marines, and U.S. Army combat engineers. Training commenced with one grueling week designed to &quot;separate the men from the boys&quot;. Some said that &quot;the men had sense enough to quit, leaving Kauffman with the boys.&quot; It was and is still considered the first &quot;Hell Week&quot;.

=== Normandy ===
In early November 1943 NCDU-11 was assigned as the advance NCDU party for Operation Overlord. They would be joined in England by 33 more NCDUs. They trained with the 146th, 277th and 299th Combat Engineers to prepare for the landing. Each Unit had five Combat engineers attached to it. The first 10 NCDUs divided into three groups. The senior officer, by rank, was the commanding officer of Group III, Lieutenant Smith (CEC). He assumed command in an unofficial capacity. His Group III worked on experimental demolitions and developed the Hagensen Pack.(an innovation that used of tetryl placed into rubber tubes that could be twisted around obstacles) As more teams arrived a NCDU Command was created for NCDUs: 11, 22–30, 41–46, 127–8, 130–42


The Germans had constructed elaborate defenses on the French coast. These included steel posts driven into the beach and topped with explosive charges. Large 3-ton steel barricades called Belgian Gates and hedgehogs were placed throughout the tidal zone. Behind which was a network of reinforced: coastal artillery, mortar and machine gun positions.

The Scouts and Raiders spent weeks gathering information during nightly surveillance missions up and down the French coast. Replicas of the Belgian Gates were constructed on the south coast of England for the NCDUs to practice demolitions on. It was possible to blow a gate to pieces, but that only created a mass of tangled iron creating more of an obstacle. The NCDUs found that the best method was to blast the structural joints of a gate so that it fell down flat.

The NCDU teams (designated Demolitions Gap-Assault teams) would come in at low tide to clear the obstacles. Their mission was to open sixteen wide corridors for the landing at each of the U.S. landing zones (Omaha Beach and Utah Beach). 
Unfortunately, the plans were not executed as laid out. The preparatory air and naval bombardment was ineffective, leaving many German guns to fire on the assault. Also, tidal conditions caused difficulties for the NCDUs. Despite heavy German fire and casualties, the NCDUs charges opened gaps in the defenses.

As the infantry came ashore, some
used obstacles for cover that had demolition charges on them. The greatest difficulty was on Omaha Beach. By nightfall thirteen of the planned sixteen gaps were open. Of the 175 NCDU men that landed, 31 were killed and 60 were wounded. The attack on Utah Beach was better, four dead and eleven wounded. Overall, NCDUs suffered a 53 percent casualty rate. NCDUs were also assigned to Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, with a few units from Normandy participating there too.

With Europe invaded Admiral Turner requisitioned all available NCDUs from Fort Pierce for integration into the UDTs for the Pacific. However, the first NCDUs, 1–10, had been staged at Turner City, Florida Island in the Solomon Islands during January 1944. A few were temporarily attached to UDTs. Later NCDUs 1–10 were combined to form Underwater Demolition Team Able. This team was disbanded with NCDUs 2 and 3, plus three others assigned to MacArthur&#x27;s 7th Amphibious force, and were the only NCDUs remaining at war&#x27;s end. The other men from Team Able were assigned to numbered UDTs.

== Underwater Demolition Teams During WWII ==
The first units designated as Underwater Demolition Teams were formed in the Pacific Theater. Rear Admiral Turner, the Navy&#x27;s amphibious expert, ordered the formation of Underwater Demolition Teams in response to the assault debacle experienced at Tarawa. Turner recognized that amphibious operations required intelligence of underwater obstacles. The personnel in teams 1-15 were primarily Seabees that had started out in the NCDUs. UDT training was at the Waipio Amphibious Operating Base, under V Amphibious Corps operational and administrative control. Most of the instructors and trainees were graduates of the Fort Pierce NCDU or Scouts and Raiders schools, Seabees, Marines, and Army soldiers.

When Teams 1 and 2 were formed they were &quot;provisional&quot; and trained by a Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion that had nothing to do with the Fort Pierce program. After a successful mission at Kwajalein, where 2 UDT men stripped down to swim trunks and effectively gathered the intelligence Admiral Turner desired, the UDT mission model evolved to daylight reconnaissance, wearing swim trunks, fins, and masks. The immediate success of the UDTs made them an indispensable part of all future amphibious landings.

A UDT was organized with approximately sixteen officers and eighty enlisted. One Marine and one Army officer were liaisons within each team. They were deployed in every major amphibious landing after Tarawa with 34 teams eventually being commissioned. Teams 1–21 were the teams that had deployed operationally, with slightly over half of the officers and enlisted coming from the Seabees in those teams. The remaining teams were not deployed due to the war ending.

===Tarawa and the formation of UDTs ===
Prior to Tarawa, both Naval and Marine Corps planners had identified coral as an issue for amphibious operations. At Tarawa the neap tide created draft issues for the Higgins boats (LCVPs) clearing the reef. The Amtracs carrying the first wave crossed the reef successfully. The LCVPs carrying the second wave ran aground, disembarking their Marines several hundred yards to shore in full combat gear, under heavy fire. Many drowned or were killed before making the beach, forced to wade across treacherously uneven coral. The first wave was left fighting without reinforcements and took heavy casualties on the beach.

This disaster made it clear to Admiral Turner that pre-assault intelligence was needed to avoid similar difficulties in future operations. To that end, Turner ordered the formation of underwater demolition teams to do reconnaissance of beach conditions and do removal of submerged obstructions for Amphibious operations. After a thorough review, V Amphibious Corps found that the only people having any applicable experience with the coral were men in the Naval Construction Battalions. The Admiral tasked Lt. Thomas C. Crist (CEC) of CB 10 to develop a method for blasting coral under combat conditions and putting together a team for that purpose. Lt. Crist started by recruiting others he had blasted coral with in CB 10 and by the end November 1943 he had assembled close to 30 officers and 150 enlisted men from the 7th Naval Construction Regiment, at Waipio Amphibious Operating Base on Maui.

===Kwajalein and the evolution of the UDT mission model===


The first operation after Tarawa was Operation Flintlock in the Marshall Islands. It began with the island of Kwajalein in January 1944. Admiral Turner wanted the intelligence and to get it, the men that Lt. Crist had staged were used to form Underwater Demolition Teams: UDT 1 and UDT 2. Initially, the team commanders were Cmdr. E. D. Brewster (CEC) and Lt. Crist (CEC). However, Lt. Crist was made Ops officer of Team 2 and Lt. John T. Koehler was made the team Commander. As with all Seabee military training, the Marines provided it. A Marine Corps Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion oversaw five weeks further training of the Seabees in UDTs 1 and 2 to prepare for the mission. UDT 1 was tasked with two daylight recons. The men were to follow Marine Corps Recon procedure with each two-man team getting close to the beach in an inflatable boat to make their observations wearing fatigues, boots, d helmets, and life-lined to their boats. Team 1 found that the reef kept them from ascertaining conditions both in the water and on the beach as had been anticipated. In keeping with the Seabee traditions of: (1) doing whatever it takes to accomplish the job and (2) not always following military rules to get it done, UDT 1 did both: the fatigues and boots came off.

Ensign Lewis F. Luehrs and Seabee Chief Bill Acheson had anticipated that they would not be able to get the intel Admiral Turner wanted following USMC Recon protocol and had worn swim trunks beneath their fatigues. Stripping down, they swam 45 minutes undetected across the reef returning with sketches of gun emplacements and other intelligence. Still in their trunks, they were taken directly to Rear Admiral Turner&#x27;s flagship to report. Afterwards, Turner concluded that the only way to get this kind of information was to do what these men had done as individual swimmers, which is what he relayed to Admiral Nimitz. The planning and decisions of Rear Admiral Turner, Ensign Luehrs, and Chief Acheson made Kwajalein a developmental day in UDT history, changing both the mission model and training regimen. Luehrs would make rank and be in UDT 3 until he was made XO of UDT 18. Acheson and three other UDT officers were posted to the 301st CB as blasting officers. The 301st specialized in Harbor dredging. It saved UDT teams from blasting channels and harbor clearance, but it required its own blasters.

Admiral Turner ordered the formation of nine teams, six for V AC and three for III Amphibious Corps. Seabees made up the majority of the men in teams 1–9, 13 and 15. The officers of those teams were primarily CEC (Seabees). UDT 2 was sent to Roi-Namur where Lt. Crist earned a Silver Star. UDTs 1 and 2 were decommissioned upon return to Hawaii with most of the men transferred to UDTs 3, 4, 5, and 6. Admiral Turner ordered the formation of nine teams, three for III Amphibious Corps and six for V Amphibious Corps (in all Teams 3–11). As more NCDUs arrived in the Pacific they were used to form even more teams. UDT 15 was an all-NCDU team. To implement these changes and grow the UDTs, Koehler was made the commanding officer of the Naval Combat Demolition Training and Experimental Base on Maui. Admiral Turner also brought on LCDR Draper Kaufmann as a combat officer.

It became obvious more men were needed than the NCDUs would supply and Cmdr. Kauffman was no longer recruiting Seabees, so Admiral Nimitz put out a call to the Pacific Fleet for volunteers. They would form three teams; UDT 14 would be the first of them. Recruiting was such an issue that three Lt. Cmdrs who had no background in demolition were transferred from USN Beach Battalions to command UDTs 11, 12, and 13.

Admiral Turner requested the establishment of the Naval Combat Demolition Training and Experimental Base at Kihei independent of Fort Pierce, expanding upon what had been learned from UDT 1 at Kwajalein. Operations began in February 1944 with Lt. Crist the first head of training. Most of the procedures from Fort Pierce were changed, replaced with an emphasis on developing swimmers, daylight reconnaissance, and no lifelines. The uniform of the day changed to diving masks, swim trunks, and a Ka-Bar, creating the UDT image as &quot;Naked Warriors&quot; (swim-fins were added after UDT 10 introduced them).

=== Roi-Namur, Saipan, Tinian, and Guam ===
At Saipan and Tinian UDTs 5, 6, and 7 were given the missions: day time for Saipan and night for Tinian. At Saipan UDT 7 developed a method to recover swimmers on the move without making the recovery vessel a stationary target.

For Guam UDTs 3, 4, and 6 were the teams assigned. When it was over the Seabee-dominated teams had made naval history. For the Marianas operations Admiral Turner recommended over sixty Silver Stars and over three hundred Bronze Stars with Vs for UDTs 3–7 That was unprecedented in U.S. Naval/Marine Corps history.

For UDTs 5 and 7, all officers received silver stars and all the enlisted received bronze stars with Vs for Operation Forager (Tinian). For UDTs 3 and 4 all officers received a silver stars and all the enlisted received bronze stars with Vs for Operation Forager (Guam). Admiral Conolly felt the commanders of teams 3 and 4 (Lt. Crist and Lt. W.G. Carberry) should have received Navy Crosses. Teams 4 &amp; 7 also received Naval Unit Commendations.

===Peleliu, Philippines, and Iwo Jima===
UDTs 6, 7, and 10 drew the Peleliu assignment while UDT 8 went to Angaur. The officers were almost all CEC and the enlisted were Seabees.

At formation UDT 10 was assigned 5 officers and 24 enlisted that had trained as OSS Operational Swimmers (Maritime Unit: Operational Swimmer Group II). They were led by a Lt. A.O. Chote Jr., who became UDT 10&#x27;s commanding officer. The men were multi-service: Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Navy but the OSS was not allowed to operate in the Pacific Theater. Admiral Nimitz needed swimmers and did approve their transfer from the OSS to his operational and administrative control. Most of their OSS gear was stored as it was not applicable to UDT work however, their swimfins came with them. The other UDTs quickly adopted them.

UDT 14 was the first all-Navy team (one of three from the Pacific fleet) even though its CO and XO were CEC and some of Team Able was incorporated. In the Philippines Leyte Gulf UDTs 10 &amp; 15 reconnoitered beaches at Luzon, teams 3, 4, 5, &amp; 8 were sent to Dulag and teams 6, 9, &amp; 10 went to Tacloban.

When UDT 3 returned to Maui the team was made the instructors of the school. Lt Crist was again made Training Officer. Under his direction training was broken into four 2-week blocks with an emphasis on swimming and reconnaissance. There were classes in night operations, unit control, coral and lava blasting in addition to bivouacking, small unit tactics and small arms. Lt Crist would be promoted to Lt Cmdr and the team would remain in Hawaii until April 1945. At that time the Seabees of UDT 3 were transferred to Fort Pierce to be the instructors there. In all they would train teams 12 to 22. Lt. Cmdr. Crist would be sent back to Hawaii.

D-minus 2 at Iwo Jima UDTs 12, 13, 14, and 15 reconnoitered the beaches from twelve LCI(G) with just one man wounded. They did come under intense heavy fire that sank three of their LCI(G) with the others seriously damaged or disabled. The LCI(G) crews suffered more than the UDTs with the skipper of one boat earning a Medal of Honor. The next day a Japanese bomb hit UDT 15&#x27;s APD, killing fifteen and wounding 23. It was the largest loss suffered by the UDTs during the war.

On D-plus 2 the beachmaster requested help. There were so many broached or damaged landing craft and the beach was so clogged with war debris that there was no place for landing craft to get ashore. Lt Cmdr. E. Hochuli of UDT 12 volunteered his team to go deal with the problem and teams 13 and 14 were ordered to go with. Lt Cmdr. Vincent Moranz of UDT 13 was &quot;reluctant, and radioed that his men ... were not salvage-men. It is reported that Capt. (Bull) Hanlon, Underwater Demolition Operations Commanding Officer radioed back that he did not want anything salvaged, he wanted that beach cleared.&quot; The difference in attitude between Hochuli and Moranz would be remembered in the unit awards.

The three teams worked for five days clearing the waters edge. While the teams all did the same job under the same conditions the Navy gave them different unit awards: UDT 12 a PUC, UDT 14 a NUC and UDT 13 nothing. The USMC ground commanders felt that every man that set foot on the island during the assault had an award coming. The Navy did not share this point of view, besides UDT 13 not a single USN beach party received a unit award either. On D-plus 2, when the UDTs set foot on beaches that were under a USMC assault, any unit award they received should have come under the USMC award protocol. The USMC Iwo Jima PUC/NUC was a mass award with the PUC going to assault units and the NUC going to support units.

UDTs also served at Eniwetok, Ulithi, Leyte, Lingayen Gulf, Zambales, Labuan, and Brunei Bay. At Lingayen UDT 9 was aboard the when she was hit by a Kamikaze. It cost the team one officer, 7 enlisted, 3 MIA and 13 wounded.

===Okinawa to the end of the war===
The largest UDT operation of WWII was the invasion of Okinawa, involving teams 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18 (nearly 1,000 men). All prior missions had been in warm tropic waters but, the waters around Okinawa were cool enough that long immersion could cause hypothermia and severe cramps. Since thermal protection for swimmers was not available, UDTs were at risk to these hazards working around Okinawa.

Operations included both real reconnaissance and demolition at the landing beaches, and feints to create the illusion of landings in other locations. Pointed poles set into the coral reef protected the beaches on Okinawa. Teams 11 and 16 were sent in to blast the poles. The charges took out all of UDT 11&#x27;s targets and half of UDT 16&#x27;s. UDT 16 aborted the operation due to the death of one of their men; hence, their mission was considered a failure. UDT 11 went back the next day and took out the remaining poles after-which the team remained to guide landing-craft to the beach.

By war&#x27;s end 34 teams had been formed with teams 1–21 having actually been deployed. The Seabees provided half of the men in the teams that saw service. The U.S. Navy did not publicize the existence of the UDTs until post war and when they did they gave credit to Lt. Commander Kauffman and the Seabees.

During WWII the Navy did not have a rating for the UDTs nor did they have an insignia. Those men with the CB rating on their uniforms considered themselves Seabees that were doing underwater demolition. They did not call themselves &quot;UDTs&quot; or &quot;Frogmen&quot; but rather &quot;Demolitioneers&quot; which had carried over from the NCDUs and LtCdr Kauffmans recruiting them from the Seabee dynamiting and demolition school. UDTs had to meet the military&#x27;s standard age guidelines, Seabees older could not volunteer.

In preparation for the invasion of Japan the UDTs created a cold water training center and mid-1945 UDTs had to meet a &quot;new physical standard&quot;. UDT 9 lost 70% of the team to this change. The last UDT demolition operation of the war was on 4 July 1945 at Balikpapan, Borneo. The UDTs continued to prepare for the invasion of Japan until VJ Day when the need for their services ceased.

With the draw-down from the war two half-strength UDTs were retained, one on each coast: UDT Baker and UDT Easy. However, the UDTs were the only special troops that avoided complete disbandment after the war, unlike the OSS Maritime Unit, the VAC Recon Battalion, and several Marine recon missions.

In 1942 the Seabees became a completely new branch of the United States War Department. The Marine Corps provided both training and an organizational model. Something that either was not shared or the Seabees chose to ignore or considered not important was the keeping of logs, journals and records. The Seabees brought this record keeping approach with to the NCDUs and UDTs.

==After World War II==

===Japan occupation===
On 20 August 1945 embarked UDT 21 at Guam as a component of the U.S. occupation force heading for Japan. Nine days later UDT 21 became the first U.S military unit to set foot on Japanese home soil when it reconned the beaches at Futtsu-misaki Point in Tokyo Bay. Their assessment was that the area was well suited for landing U.S. amphibious forces. UDT 21 made a large sign to greet the Marines on the beach. Team 21 was all fleet and the sign said greetings from &quot;USN&quot; UDT 21. The next day &quot;Begor&quot; took UDT 21 to Yokosuka Naval Base. There the team cleared the docks for the first U.S. warship to dock in Japan, . The team remained in Tokyo Bay until 8 Sept when it was tasked with locating remaining Kamikaze and two-man submarines at Katsura Wan, Uchiura Wan at Suruga Bay, Sendai, Onohama Shipyards and Choshi. Orders arrived for &quot;Begor&quot; to return the team to San Diego on 27 September.

From 21 to 26 September UDT 11 was at Nagasaki and reported men getting sick from the stench.

=== China ===
With the war over thousands of Japanese troops remained in China. The issue was given to the Marine&#x27;s III Marine Amphibious Corps. UDT 9 was assigned to Operation Beleaguer to recon the landings of the 1st Marine Division at Taku and Qingdao the first two weeks of October 1945. On their way to China the Navy had UDT 8 carry out a mission at Jinaen, Korea 8–27 September 1945. When UDT 9 arrived back in the States it was made one of the two post-War teams and redesignated UDT Baker.

UDT 8 was also sent to China and was at Taku, Yantai, and Qingdao.

===Operation Crossroads===
Bikini atoll was chosen for the site of the nuclear tests of Operation Crossroads.&quot;In March 1946, Project Y scientists from Los Alamos decided that the analysis of a sample of water from the immediate vicinity of the nuclear detonation was essential if the tests were to be properly evaluated. After consideration of several proposals to accomplish this, it was finally decided to employ drone boats of the type used by Naval Combat Demolition Units in France during the war&quot;.

UDT Easy, later named UDT 3, was given the designation TU 1.1.3 for the Operation and was assigned the control and maintenance of the drone boats. On 27 April, 7 officers and 51 enlisted men embarked the at the Seabee base Port Hueneme, CA, for transit to Bikini. At Bikini the drones were controlled from the &quot;Begor&quot;. Once a water sample was taken the drone would return to the &quot;Begor&quot; to be hosed down for decontamination. After a Radiation Safety Officer had taken a Geiger counter reading and the OK given, the UDTs would board with a radiation chemist to retrieve the sample. &quot;Begor&quot; came to have the reputation as the most contaminated boat in the fleet.

A major issue afterwards was the treatment of the dislocated natives. In November 1948, the Bikinians were relocated to the uninhabited Island of Kili, however that island was located inside a coral reef that had no channel for access to the sea. In the spring of 1949, the governor of the Trust Territories, Marshall Group requested the U.S. Navy blast a channel to change this. That task was given to the Seabees on Kwajalin whose CO quickly determined this was actually a UDT project. He sent a request to CINCPACFLT who forwarded it to COMPHIBPAC. This ultimately resulted in the sending of UDT 3 on a Civic action program that turned out better than politicians could have hoped. The King of the Bikinians held a send off feast for the UDTs the night before they departed.

===Submersible Operations===
Post WWII the UDTs continued to research new techniques for underwater and shallow-water operations. One area was the use of SCUBA equipment. Dr. Chris Lambertsen had developed the Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit (LARU), an oxygen rebreather, which was used by the Maritime Unit of the OSS. In October 1943, he demonstrated it to LtCmdr. Kauffman, but was told the device was not applicable to current UDT operations. Dr. Lambertsen and the OSS continued to work on closed-circuit oxygen diving and combat swimming. When the OSS was dissolved in 1945, Lambertsen retained the LARU inventory. He later demonstrated the LARU to Army Engineers, the Coast Guard, and the UDTs. In 1947, he demonstrated the LARU to LtCmdr. Francis &quot;Doug&quot; Fane, then a senior UDT commander. 
LtCmdr. Fane was enthusiastic for new diving techniques. He pushed for the adoption of rebreathers and SCUBA gear for future operations, but the Navy Experimental Diving Unit and the Navy Dive School, which used the old &quot;hard-hat&quot; diving apparatus, declared the new equipment be too dangerous. Nonetheless, LtCmdr. Fane invited Dr. Lambertsen to NAB Little Creek, Virginia in January 1948 to demonstrate and train UDT personnel in SCUBA operations. This was the first-ever SCUBA training for USN divers. Following this training, Lcdr. Fane and Dr. Lambertsen demonstrated new UDT capabilities with a successful lock-out and re-entry from , an underway submarine, to show the Navy&#x27;s need for this capability. LtCmdr. Fane then started the classified &quot;Submersible Operations&quot; or SUBOPS platoon with men drawn from UDT 2 and 4 under the direction of Lieutenant (junior grade) Bruce Dunning.

LtCmdr. Fane also brought the conventional &quot;Aqua-lung&quot; open-circuit SCUBA system into use by the UDTs. Open-circuit SCUBA is less useful to combat divers, as the exhausted air produces a tell-tale trail of bubbles. However, in the early 1950s, the UDTs decided they preferred open-circuit SCUBA, and converted entirely to it. The remaining stock of LARUs was supposedly destroyed in a beach-party bonfire. Later on, the UDT reverted to closed-circuit SCUBA, using improved rebreathers developed by Dr. Lambertsen.

It was at this time that the UDTs, led by LtCmdr. Fane, established training facilities at Saint Thomas in the Virgin Islands.

The UDTs also began developing weapons skills and procedures for commando operations on land in coastal regions. The UDTs started experiments with insertion/extraction by helicopter, jumping from a moving helicopter into the water or rappelling like mountain climbers to the ground. Experimentation developed a system for emergency extraction by plane called &quot;Skyhook&quot;. Skyhook utilized a large helium balloon and cable rig with harness. A special grabbing device on the nose of a C-130 enabled a pilot to snatch the cable tethered to the balloon and lift a person off the ground. Once airborne, the crew would winch the cable in and retrieve the personnel though the back of the aircraft. Training this technique was discontinued following the death of a SEAL at NAB Coronado during a training exercise. Teams still utilize the Skyhook for equipment extraction and retain the combat capability for personnel if needed.

== Korean War ==
During the Korean War, the UDTs operated on the coasts of North Korea, with their efforts initially focused on demolitions and mine disposal. Additionally, the UDT accompanied South Korean commandos on raids in the North to demolish railroad tunnels and bridges. The higher-ranking officers of the UDT frowned upon this activity because it was a non-traditional use of the Naval forces, which took them too far from the water line. Due to the nature of the war, the UDT maintained a low operational profile. Some of the better-known missions include the transport of spies into North Korea, and the destruction of North Korean fishing nets.

A more traditional role for the UDT was in support of Operation CHROMITE, the amphibious landing at Inchon. UDT 1 and UDT 3 divers went in ahead of the landing craft, scouting mud flats, marking low points in the channel, clearing fouled propellers, and searching for mines. Four UDT personnel acted as wave-guides for the Marine landing.

The UDT assisted in clearing mines in Wonsan harbor, under fire from enemy shore batteries. Two minesweepers were sunk in these operations. A UDT diver dove on the wreck of , the first U.S. combat operation using SCUBA gear.

The Korean War was a period of transition for the men of the UDT. They tested their previous limits and defined new parameters for their special style of warfare. These new techniques and expanded horizons positioned the UDT well to assume an even broader role as war began brewing to the south in Vietnam.


== NASA ==
Initially, the splashdown of U.S. crewed space capsules were unassisted. That changed quickly after the second crewed flight; when Mercury 11 hit the water following reentry, the hatch blew and she sank, nearly drowning Gus Grissom. All Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo space capsules were subsequently met by UDTs 11 or 12 upon splashdown. Before the hatch was opened, the UDTs would attach a flotation collar to the capsule and liferaft for the astronauts to safely exit the craft.

== Vietnam War ==
The Navy entered the Vietnam War in 1958, when the UDTs delivered a small watercraft far up the Mekong River into Laos. In 1961, naval advisers started training South Vietnamese personnel in South Vietnam. The men were called the &quot;Liên Đoàn Người Nhái&quot; (LDNN) or Vietnamese Frogmen, which translates as &quot;Frogmen Team&quot;.

UDT teams carried out hydrographic surveys in South Vietnam&#x27;s coastal waters and reconnaissance missions of harbors, beaches and rivers often under hazardous conditions and enemy fire.

Later, the UDTs supported the Amphibious Ready Groups operating on South Vietnam&#x27;s rivers. UDTs manned riverine patrol craft and went ashore to demolish obstacles and enemy bunkers. They operated throughout South Vietnam, from the Mekong Delta (Sea Float), the Parrot&#x27;s Beak and French canal AO&#x27;s through I Corps and the Song Cui Dai estuary south of Da Nang.

== Birth of Navy SEALs ==
In the mid-1950s, the Navy saw how the UDT&#x27;s mission had expanded to a broad range of &quot;unconventional warfare&quot;, but also that this clashed with the UDT&#x27;s traditional focus on maritime operations swimming, boat, and diving operations. It was therefore decided to create a new type of unit that would build on the UDT&#x27;s elite qualities and water-borne expertise, but would add land combat skills, including parachute training and guerrilla/counterinsurgency operations. These new teams would come to be known as the US Navy SEALs, an acronym for Sea, Air, and Land. Initially there was a lag in the unit&#x27;s creation until President John F. Kennedy took office. Kennedy recognized the need for unconventional warfare, and supported the use of special operations forces against guerrilla activity. The Navy moved forward to establish its new special operations force and in January 1962 commissioned SEAL Team ONE in NAB Coronado and SEAL Team TWO at NAB Little Creek. In 1964, Boat Support Unit ONE was established, designed to directly support NSW operations, and was initially outfitted primarily by UDTs and newly established SEALs. UDT-11 &amp; 12 were still active on the west coast and UDT-21 &amp; 22 on the east coast. The SEALs quickly earned a reputation for valor and stealth in Vietnam, where they conducted clandestine raids in perilous territory.

===Reorganization===
From 1974–1975, UDT 13 was redesignated; some personnel established Underwater Construction Teams, while others joined the special boat detachment. In May 1983, the remaining UDT teams were reorganized as SEAL teams. UDT 11 became SEAL Team Five and UDT 12 became Seal Delivery Vehicle Team One. UDT 21 became SEAL Team Four and UDT 22 became Seal Delivery Vehicle Team Two. A new team, SEAL Team Three was established in October 1983. Since then, teams of SEALs have taken on clandestine missions in war-torn regions around the world, tracking high-profile targets such as Panama&#x27;s Manuel Noriega and Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar, and playing integral roles in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

==Badge==
For those who served in an Underwater Demolition Team, the U.S. Navy authorized the Underwater Demolition operator badge in 1970. However, the UDT badge was phased out in 1971, a few months after it appeared, as was the silver badge for enlisted UDT/SEAL frogmen. After that, SEAL and UDT operators, both officer and enlisted, all wore the same gold Trident, as well as gold Navy jump wings.

== Unit awards ==
The UDTs have received several unit citations and commendations. Members who participated in actions that merited the award are authorized to wear the medal or ribbon associated with the award on their uniform. Awards and decorations of the United States Armed Forces have different categories, (i.e. Service, Campaign, Unit, and Personal). Unit Citations are distinct from the other decorations.

<doc id="606411" wikidata="Q503192" url="?curid=606411" title="Walter Bradford Cannon">
<text>Walter Bradford Cannon (October 19, 1871 – October 1, 1945) was an American physiologist, professor and chairman of the Department of Physiology at Harvard Medical School. He coined the term &quot;fight or flight response&quot;, and developed the theory of homeostasis. He popularized his theories in his book &quot;The Wisdom of the Body&quot;, first published in 1932.

==Life and career==
Cannon was born on October 19, 1871, in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, the son of Colbert Hanchett Cannon and his wife Wilma Denio. His sister Ida Maud Cannon (1877-1960) became a noted hospital social worker at Massachusetts General Hospital.

In his autobiography &quot;The Way of an Investigator&quot;, Cannon counts himself among the descendants of Jacques de Noyon, a French Canadian explorer and coureur des bois. His Calvinist family was intellectually active, including readings from James Martineau, John Fiske (philosopher), and James Freeman Clarke. Cannon&#x27;s curiosity also led him to Thomas Henry Huxley, John Tyndall, George Henry Lewes, and William Kingdon Clifford. A high school teacher, Mary Jeannette Newson, became his mentor. &quot;Miss May&quot; Newson motivated him and helped him take his academic skills into Harvard University in 1892.

Upon finishing his undergraduate studies in 1896, he entered Harvard Medical School. He started using X-rays to study the physiology of digestion while working with Henry P. Bowditch. In 1900 he received his medical degree.

After graduation, Cannon was hired by William Townsend Porter at Harvard as an instructor in the Department of Physiology while continuing his digestion study. Cannon was promoted to an assistant professor of physiology in 1902. He was a close friend of the physicist, G. W. Pierce, and together they founded the Wicht Club with other young instructors for social and professional purposes. In 1906, Cannon succeeded Bowditch as the Higginson Professor and chairman of the Department of Physiology at Harvard Medical School until 1942. From 1914 to 1916, Cannon was also President of the American Physiological Society.

He was married to Cornelia James Cannon, a best-selling author and feminist reformer. On July 19, 1901, during their honeymoon in Montana, they were the first people to reach the summit of the unclimbed southwest peak (2657 m or 8716 ft) of Goat Mountain, between Lake McDonald and Logan Pass. That area is now Glacier National Park. The peak was subsequently named, Mount Cannon, by the United States Geological Survey The couple had five children; A son, Dr. Bradford Cannon, a military plastic surgeon and radiation researcher. The daughters were Wilma Cannon Fairbank (who was married to John K. Fairbank), Linda Cannon Burgess, Helen Cannon Bond, and Marian Cannon Schlesinger, a painter and author living in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

His actions and his statements may infer his philosophy of life. Born into a Calvinistic family, he broke away from religious authoritarianism and became independent from his prior dogma. Later in life, he states that naturally occurring events are what makes for a useful end. He took on the role of a naturalist where believed that the body and mind are inseparable as an organismic unit. The explanations of his work should enable man to live more wisely, happily, and intelligently without the interjection of supernatural interference.

E. Digby Baltzell said that Dr. Cannon was once offered a job at the Mayo Clinic for twice his Harvard salary. Cannon declined, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t need twice as much money. All I need is fifty cents for a haircut once a month, and fifty cents a day to get lunch.&quot;

Cannon was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1906, the American Philosophical Society in 1908, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1914.

Cannon supported animal experimentation and opposed the arguments of anti-vivisectionists. In 1911, he authored a booklet for the American Medical Association criticizing the arguments of anti-vivisectionists.

Walter Cannon died on October 1, 1945, in Franklin, New Hampshire.

== Work ==

Walter Cannon began his career in science as a Harvard undergraduate in the year 1892. Henry Pickering Bowditch, who had worked with Claude Bernard, directed the laboratory in physiology at Harvard. Here Cannon began his research: he used the newly discovered x-rays to study the mechanism of swallowing and the motility of the stomach. Withi his first experiments, he was able to watch the course of a button down a dog&#x27;s esophagus. He said in his autobiography, &quot;The Way of an Investigator&quot;, &quot;The whole purpose of my effort was to see the peristaltic waves to learn their effects. Only after some time did I note that the absence of activity was accompanied by signs of perturbation, and when serenity was restored the waves promptly reappeared.&quot;

He demonstrated deglutition in a goose at the APS meeting in December 1896 and published his first paper on this research in the first issue of the &quot;American Journal of Physiology&quot; in January 1898.

In 1945 Cannon summarized his career in physiology by describing his focus at different ages:
* Age 26 – 40: digestion and the bismuth meal
* Age 40 – 46: bodily effects of emotional excitement
* Age 46 – 51: wound shock investigations
* Age 51 – 59: stable states of the organism
* Age 59 – 68: chemical mediation of nerve impulses (collaboration with Arturo Rosenblueth)
* Age 68 + : chemical sensitivity of nerve-isolated organs

=== Scientific contributions ===

;Use of salts of heavy metals in X-rays
:He was one of the first researchers to mix salts of heavy metals (including bismuth subnitrate, bismuth oxychloride, and barium sulfate) into foodstuffs to improve the contrast of x-ray images of the digestive tract. The barium meal is a modern derivative of this research.

;Fight or flight
:In 1915, he coined the term &quot;fight or flight&quot; to describe an animal&#x27;s response to threats in &quot;Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage: An Account of Recent Researches into the Function of Emotional Excitement&quot;. He asserted that not only physical emergencies, such as blood loss from trauma but also psychological emergencies, such as antagonistic encounters between members of the same species, evoke the release of adrenaline into the bloodstream.

As per Cannon, adrenaline exerts several important effects on different body organs, all of which maintain homeostasis in fight-or-flight situations. For example, in the skeletal muscle of the limbs, adrenaline relaxes blood vessels which increases local blood flow. Adrenaline constricts blood vessels in the skin and minimizes blood loss from physical trauma. Adrenaline also releases the key metabolic fuel, glucose, from the liver into the bloodstream. 
However, the fact that aggressive attack and fearful escape both involve adrenaline release into the bloodstream does not imply an equivalence of “fight” with “flight” from a physiological or biochemical point of view.

;Wound shock
:As a military physician in World War I he discovered that the blood of shocked men was acidic. As a member of the British Medical Research Council&#x27;s Special Committee on Shock and Allied Conditions, he advocated treating shocked wounded by infusing sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the acid. He and William Bayliss infused acid into an anesthetized cat, which died. However, a second trial done with Bayliss and Henry Dale failed to produce shock. The shock was successfully treated by infusing saline containing some larger molecules.

;Homeostasis
:He developed the concept of homeostasis from the earlier idea of Claude Bernard of milieu interieur, and popularized it in his book &quot;The Wisdom of the Body&quot;. Cannon presented four tentative propositions to describe the general features of homeostasis:
:#Constancy in an open system requires mechanisms that act to maintain this system, just like our bodies. Cannon based this proposition on insights into steady states such as glucose concentrations, body temperature, and acid-base balance.
:#Steady-state conditions require that any tendency toward change automatically meets with factors that resist change. An increase in blood sugar results in thirst as the body attempts to dilute the concentration of sugar in the extracellular fluid.
:#The regulating system that determines the homeostatic state consists of many cooperating mechanisms acting simultaneously or successively. Blood sugar is regulated by insulin, glucagon, and other hormones that control its release from the liver or its uptake by the tissues.
:#Homeostasis does not occur by chance, but is the result of organized self-government.

;The Sympathoadrenal System

Cannon proposed the existence and functional unity of the sympathoadrenal (or “sympathoadrenomedullary” or “sympathico-adrenal”) system. He theorized that the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal gland work together as a unit to maintain homeostasis in emergencies. To identify and quantify adrenaline release during stress, beginning in about 1919 Cannon exploited an ingenious experimental setup. He would surgically excise the nerves supplying the heart of a laboratory animal such as a dog or cat. Then he would subject the animal to a stressor and record the heart rate response. With the nerves to the heart removed, he could deduce that if the heart rate increased in response to the perturbation, then the increase in heart rate must have resulted from the actions of a hormone. Finally, he would compare the results of an animal with intact adrenal glands with those in an animal from which he had removed the adrenal glands. From the difference in the heart rate between the two animals, he could further infer that the hormone responsible for the increase in heart rate came from the adrenal glands. Moreover, the amount of increase in the heart rate provided a measure of the amount of hormone released. Cannon became so convinced that the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal gland functioned as a unit that in the 1930s that he formally proposed that the sympathetic nervous system uses the same chemical messenger—adrenaline—as does the adrenal gland. Cannon’s notion of a unitary sympathoadrenal system persists to this day. Researchers in the area have come to question the validity of the notion of a unitary sympathoadrenal system, although clinicians often continue to lump together the two components.

;Cannon-Bard theory
:Cannon developed the Cannon-Bard theory with physiologist Philip Bard to try to explain why people feel emotions first and then act upon them.

;Dry mouth
:He put forward the Dry Mouth Hypothesis, stating that people get thirsty because their mouths get dry. He experimented on two dogs. He made incisions in their throats and inserted small tubes. Any water swallowed would go through their mouths and out by the tubes, never reaching their stomachs. He found out that these dogs would lap up the same amount of water as control dogs.

<doc id="606413" wikidata="Q2016288" url="?curid=606413" title="Chuckwalla">
<text>Chuckwallas are lizards found primarily in arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Some are found on coastal islands. The five species of chuckwallas are all placed within the genus Sauromalus; they are part of the iguanid family, Iguanidae.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Sauromalus&quot;, is said to be a combination of two ancient Greek words: &quot;sauros&quot; meaning &quot;lizard&quot; and &quot;homalos&quot; (ὁμαλός) meaning &quot;flat&quot;. The common name &quot;chuckwalla&quot; derives from the Shoshone word &quot;tcaxxwal&quot; or Cahuilla &quot;čaxwal&quot;, transcribed by Spaniards as &quot;chacahuala&quot;.

===Extant species===
== Description ==
Chuckwallas are stocky, wide-bodied lizards with flattened midsections and prominent bellies. Their tails are thick, tapering to a blunt tip. Loose folds of skin characterize the neck and sides of their bodies, which are covered in small, coarsely granular scales. The common chuckwalla (&quot;Sauromalus ater&quot;) measures 15 3/4 inches long, whereas insular species such as the San Esteban chuckwalla of San Esteban Island (&quot;Sauromalus varius&quot;) can measure as long as 30 in.

They are sexually dimorphic, with males having reddish-pink to orange, yellow, or light gray bodies and black heads, shoulders, and limbs; females and juveniles have bodies with scattered spots or contrasting bands of light and dark in shades of gray or yellow. Males are generally larger than females and possess well-developed femoral pores located on the inner sides of their thighs; these pores produce secretions believed to play a role in marking territory.

== Range, habitat, and diet ==
The genus &quot;Sauromalus&quot; has a wide distribution in biomes of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts. The common chuckwalla (&quot;S. ater&quot;) is the species with the greatest range, found from southern California east to southern Nevada and Utah and western Arizona, and south to Baja California and northwestern Mexico. The peninsular chuckwalla (&quot;S. australis&quot;) is found on the eastern portion of the southern half of the Baja California Peninsula.

The other species are island-dwelling, so have much more restricted distributions. The Angel Island chuckwalla (&quot;S. hispidus&quot;) is found on Isla Ángel de la Guarda and surrounding islands off the coast of the Baja California Peninsula. Two rare and endangered species are the Montserrat chuckwalla (&quot;S. slevini&quot;) found on Islas Carmen, Coronados, and Montserrat in the southern Gulf of California and the San Esteban chuckwalla or painted chuckwalla (&quot;S. varius&quot;) found on San Esteban Island, Lobos, and Pelicanos.
Chuckwallas prefer lava flows and rocky areas typically vegetated by creosote bush and other such drought-tolerant scrub. The lizards may be found at elevations up to 4,500 ft (1,370 m).

Primarily herbivorous, chuckwallas feed on leaves, fruit, and flowers of annuals and perennial plants; insects represent a supplementary prey. The lizards are said to prefer yellow flowers, such as those of the brittlebush (&quot;Encelia farinosa&quot;).

== Behavior and reproduction==

Harmless to humans, these lizards are known to run from potential threats. When disturbed, a chuckwalla wedges itself into a tight rock crevice and inflates its lungs to entrench itself.

Males are seasonally and conditionally territorial; an abundance of resources tends to create a hierarchy based on size, with one large male dominating the area&#x27;s smaller males. Chuckwallas use a combination of color and physical displays, namely &quot;push-ups&quot;, head-hobbing, and gaping of the mouth, to communicate and defend their territory.

Chuckwallas are diurnal animals and as they are ectothermic, spend much of their mornings and winter days . These lizards are well adapted to desert conditions; they are active at temperatures up to . Chuckwallas hibernate during cooler months and emerge in February. Juveniles emerge first, then adults, as temperatures reach around .

Mating occurs from April to July, with five to 16 eggs laid between June and August. The eggs hatch in late September. Chuckwallas may live for 25 years or more.

==Human use==
The Seri people considered the Angel Island species of chuckwalla an important food item. They are believed to have translocated the lizards to most of the islands in Bahia de los Angeles for use as a food source in times of need.

<text>Alfred John North (11 June 1855 – 6 May 1917) was an Australian ornithologist.
North was born in Melbourne and was educated at Melbourne Grammar School. He was appointed to the Australian Museum, Sydney in 1886 and was given a permanent position there five years later.
He wrote a &quot;List of the Insectivorous Birds of New South Wales&quot; (1897) and a &quot;Descriptive Catalogue of the Nests and Eggs of Birds Found Breeding in Australia and Tasmania&quot; (1889) with George Barnard as co-author. He described a number of birds for the first time, many in the &quot;Victorian Naturalist&quot;, the magazine of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria of which he was a founding member.

<text>The Paris Air Show (, &quot;Salon du Bourget&quot;) is a trade fair and air show held in odd years at Paris–Le Bourget Airport in France. Organized by the French aerospace industry&#x27;s primary representative body, the &quot;Groupement des industries françaises aéronautiques et spatiales&quot; (GIFAS), it is the largest air show and aerospace-industry exhibition event in the world, measured by number of exhibitors and size of exhibit space, followed by UK&#x27;s Farnborough Air Show, Dubai Air Show, and Singapore Airshow.

First held in 1909, the Paris Air Show was held every odd year from 1949 to 2019, when the 53rd Air Show attracted 2,453 exhibitors from 49 countries and occupied more than 125,000 square meters. Organizers canceled the 2021 show due to the COVID pandemic. It resumed in 2023.

It is a large trade fair, demonstrating military and civilian aircraft, and is attended by many military forces and the major aircraft manufacturers, often announcing major aircraft sales.
It starts with four professional days and is then opened to the general public followed from Friday to Sunday. The format is similar to Farnborough and the ILA Berlin Air Show, both staged in even years.

== History ==

The Paris Air Show traces its history to 1908, when a section of the Paris Motor Show was dedicated to aircraft.
The following year, a dedicated air show was held at the Grand Palais from 25 September to 17 October, during which 100,000 visitors turned out to see products and innovations from 380 exhibitors. There were four further shows before the First World War. 

The air show continued to be held at the Grand Palais, and from 1949 flying demonstrations were staged at Paris Orly Airport. In 1953, the show was relocated from the Grand Palais to Le Bourget. The show was drawing international notice in the 1960s. Since the 1970s, the show has emerged as the main international reference of the aeronautical sector.

===1967===
The 1967 air show was opened by French President Charles de Gaulle, who toured the exhibits and shook hands with two Soviet cosmonauts and two American astronauts.
Prominently displayed by the Soviet Union was a three-stage Vostok rocket, such as the one that had carried Yuri Gagarin into space on April 12, 1961. The &quot;extraordinarily powerful&quot; Vostok was downplayed by American missile experts as &quot;rather old and unsophisticated.&quot; The American exhibit, the largest at the fair, featured the F-111 swing-wing fighter bomber, a replica of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. and the Ling-Temco-Vought XC-142A, a cargo plane capable of a vertical takeoff and landing.
A full-size model of the supersonic Concorde was displayed by the French and British, auguring its successful first flight on March 2, 1969.

===1969===
&quot;The largest plane in the world,&quot; the Boeing 747 jet airliner, arrived on June 3, after flying non-stop from Seattle, Washington, and the Apollo 8 command module, charred by its re-entry, was there flanked by the Apollo 9 astronauts, but the most-viewed exhibit was the supersonic Concorde, which made its first flight over Paris as the show opened.

===1971===
The Soviet TU-144 supersonic airliner was flown to Le Bourget for the 1971 show, drawing comparisons with the French Concorde. Landing with the Concorde was the world&#x27;s largest aircraft, the American Lockheed C-5A Galaxy.

===1973===

The crash of the Soviet Tu-144, see below, overshadowed the 1973 show, otherwise characterized by &quot;There was nothing new.&quot;

===1975===
One hundred and eighty-two aircraft were scheduled for appearance. Despite restrictions that followed the TU-144 crash in 1973, a day of flying pleased viewers. In particular, the American YF-16 and the French Mirage F-1E competed in turn before a critical audience. Days later, Belgium became the fourth European nation to choose the YF-16 over the F-1E.

===1977===
Celebration of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s trans-Atlantic flight to Le Bourget fifty years ago recalled that historic event. Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Lindbergh&#x27;s widow, attended the ceremony along with early trans-Atlantic pilots, Maurice Bellonte and Armand Lotti. Recent extension of coastal limits to 200 nautical miles has produced new maritime-reconnaissance (MR) aircraft. The crash of a Fairchild A-10 tank-destroyer led to tightened rules on air show demonstrations.

===1979===
Two airliners, the Airbus A310 and the Boeing 767, are competing for the international market, but neither will carry passengers before 1982. The Westland WG30 transport helicopter shows promise. &quot;The Mirage 4000 remains a question mark&quot; despite being &quot;surely the main highlight this year at Le Bourget.&quot;

===1981===
Exhibiting at the show, Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas/Fokker vie for the 150-seat airline market, while Rolls-Royce/Japan, General Electric/Snecma (CFM), and Pratt &amp; Whitney contest for their engines. The Northrop F-5G Tigershark mockup was on display and expected to fly in 1982 with delivery the following year. A novelty was Air Transat, a light aircraft trans-Atlantic race from Le Bourget to Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and back, won by a twin engine Piper Navaho and a Beechcraft Bonanza.

===1983===
The American Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; was flown around Paris and towered over other exhibits, but &quot;much more intriguing&quot; were replicas of two twin-engined fighters, the British Aerospace ACA and French Dassault Breguet ACX. Sales of Boeing 757 and Airbus A310 airliners to Singapore Airlines were welcome news during an ongoing recession.

===1985===
The Soviet Antonov An-124 Ruslan military heavy lifter was the largest exhibit in 1985. Propfan engines stirred interest. Reflecting the upturn in the economy, Boeing and Airbus announced new contracts totaling as much as $1,700 million. The Hubble Space Telescope should be deployed in 1986.

===1987===
Newly introduced, in the rain, were the Soviet Mil Mi-34 Helicopter, the Israeli Super Phantom, and the Harrier GR.5. Airbus announced firm orders for both the A330 and A340 airliners. Exhibiting at the show for the first time, the Chinese displayed, among others, the A-5C Attacker (Fantan) and FT-7. Richard Rutan and Jeana Yeager, who flew a Voyager non-stop around the world without refueling, were present, but their aircraft was not.

=== 1989 ===

The &quot;38th Paris International Air and Space Show&quot; or &quot;1989 Paris Air Show&quot;, featured a variety of aerospace technology from NATO and Warsaw Pact nations.
A Mikoyan MiG-29 crashed during a demonstration flight with no loss of life. The then-Soviet space shuttle Buran and its carrier, Antonov An-225 Mriya, was displayed at this show.
A Sukhoi Su-27 made debut to western world, as well first publicly seen &quot;Cobra&quot; maneuver.

===1991===
Despite a Department of Defense display of the F-117A Stealth Fighter and other Gulf War armaments, most American contractors stayed home, so Soviet aircraft drew attention, among them the Beriev Be-42 Mermaid (A-40 Albatros) amphibian, the MiG-31 Foxhound interceptor, and the Yak-141 short take-off/vertical landing (ASTOVL) supersonic fighter. When it receives its first customer order, Dassault plans to begin production of the Mirage 2000-5, which is a &quot;new machine compared to the basic Mirage 2000.&quot;

=== 1993 ===
The show attracted 1,611 exhibitors from 39 countries and nearly 300,000 visitors attended the show. Dassault featured the debut of the Falcon 2000, and Airbus will manufacture the 130-seat A319.

=== 1995 ===

The 41st Paris Air Show main attraction was the stealth B-2 Spirit bomber, along with the Tupolev Tu-160 and Sukhoi Su-34 bombers.
The flying display included the Bell-Boeing V-22 tilt-rotor, the Airbus Beluga Super Transporter, the Eurofighter 2000, the Rockwell-MBB X-31 high-manoeuvrability fighter demonstrator, the McDonnell Douglas C-17 military transport, the Eurocopter EC135 civil helicopter, the Sukhoi Su-35 fighter, and the Daimler-Benz Aerospace Dornier 328-100, and for the first time on static the Boeing 777, Saab Gripen, Atlas Cheetah Mirage and Cessna Citation X.

===1997===
America Eagle announced purchase of forty-two EMB-145 regional jets from Embraer and twenty-five Bombardier CRJ700 airliners from Bombardier. Spectators saw two Eurofighter Typhoon EF2000s flying together. A full-scale mock-up of the Bell Boeing 609 civil tilt-rotor aircraft attracted attention. IAR Brasov featured a prototype Anti-Tank Optronic Search and Combat System (SOCAT) helicopter, an upgrade of the IAR-330 Puma.

===1999===
The 1999 show continued a trend away from displays of new aircraft toward announcements of new contracts. Although new entries such as the Fairchild 30-seat 328JET and the Boeing 100-seat 717-200
 attracted interest, airlines ordered as many as 103 Embraer ERJ-135s and 145s in addition to a 4.9 billion-dollar order for ERJ-170s and ERJ-190-200s. In February, the Russian Il-103 received US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval, a breakthrough in certifying Russian aircraft for the American market. Subsequent certification for the Ilyushin Il-96T wide-bodied jet was displayed at the show.

===2001===
Boeing introduced scale models of their Sonic Cruiser which would reach speeds approaching Mach 0.98, together with a walk-through hologram. The Airbus A380, seating 555, offered size rather than speed, and was there on the tarmac. Crowds toured the restored Antonov An-225 Dream, the world&#x27;s largest aircraft. Dassault featured a model of the new Falcon FNX business jet that is projected to fly 10,500 kilometers at Mach 0.88. The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is undergoing STOVL testing, is a likely replacement for older American F-15E Strike Eagles and F-117 Nighthawks.

===2003===
The Concorde F-BTSD made its farewell landing at Le Bourget on June 14, the opening day, and the Dassault&#x27;s Mirage 2000 and Rafale put on a show overhead. Pilotless planes, such as the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and General Atomics Predator drew attention. Boeing publicized the 7E7 Dreamliner.

===2005===
FlightGlobal cited the Airbus A380 and &quot;nineteen remarkable first appearances,&quot; including Dassault&#x27;s Falcon 7X and Gulfstream&#x27;s G550 business jets, Embraer&#x27;s EMB-195 regional jet, and the second prototype of Alenia Aermacchi&#x27;s M-346 advanced jet trainer. CompositesWorld added the Boeing 777-200LR and the Dassault UCAV Neuron.

===2007===
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner sold briskly, as did the Airbus A380 and A350 XWB. A mockup of the Lockheed Martin Joint Strike Fighter was on display. The IAI Heron TP UAV is ready to enter production. The Spanish steer-by-leaning AN-1 AeroQuad flying platform from Aeris Naviter weighed only 100 kilograms.

=== 2009 ===

The 48th International Paris Air Show took place in 2009 and marked a hundred years of technological innovation in aeronautics and space conquest. The event was held from 15 to 21 June, at Le Bourget. A memorial service was held for the victims of Air France Flight 447.

===2011===
The 2011 show was the 49th presentation, and hosted over international exhibitors in 28 international pavilions. A total of 150 aircraft were on display, including the solar-electric aircraft Solar Impulse.

A demo A380 was damaged the day before the exhibition opened and needed a replacement; while the new Airbus A400M Atlas military transport aircraft had an engine failure, but could still perform some demonstration flights.

===2013===

American fighter jets were not on display for the first time in more than two decades due to budget cuts.

===2015===

The 2015 show, held from June 15 to June 21, 2015, saw the new Dassault Falcon 8X, Airbus A350 XWB and Bombardier CS300 and received 351,584 visitors, 2,303 exhibitors over 122,500 square metres of exhibition space, 4,359 journalists from 72 countries and 130 billion euros in purchases and &quot;cemented its position as the world&#x27;s largest event dedicated to the aerospace industry&quot;.
During the show, Airbus Helicopters announced a successor to the Super Puma, called the Airbus Helicopters X6.

===2017===
The 52nd Air Show was held from 19 to 25 June 2017, with 2,381 exhibitors from 48 countries, showing 140 aircraft including for the first time the Airbus A321neo, Airbus A350-1000, Boeing 787-10, Boeing 737 MAX 9, Kawasaki P-1, Mitsubishi MRJ90 and Lockheed Martin F-35.
Inaugurated by French President Emmanuel Macron, it was visited by 290 official delegations from 98 countries and 7 international organizations, French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, 3,450 journalists, 142,000 trade visitors and 180,000 general public visitors.
Announcements for 934 commercial aircraft orders and purchasing commitments were worth a catalogue value of US$115 billion.

There were 1,226 order and commitments : 352 firm orders, 699 letters of intent or memorandums of understanding, 40 options and 135 options letters of intent; plus 229 conversions of existing orders, mainly for the Boeing 737-10 MAX variant launched at the show.
There were mainly narrowbodies with 1,021 orders or commitments against 76 widebodies, 48 regional jets and 81 turboprop airliners.
With 766, mainly preliminary deals, Boeing led Airbus with 331, while Bombardier Aerospace had 64, Embraer 48 and ATR Aircraft 17.
Nearly half of those order and commitments was from aircraft lessors with 513, and where the operator was known, 43% came from Asia-Pacific, 27% from the middle east, 10% from Europe as from South America, 7% from Africa and 3% from North America.

===2019===
The 53rd Air Show was held from 17 to 23 June 2019 with 2,453 exhibitors from 49 countries over of exhibition space for 140 aircraft shown including the recently certified Airbus A330neo and Boeing KC-46, Bombardier Global 7500, Embraer Praetor 600 and soon to be certified Cessna Citation Latitude; it saw 316,470 unique visitors (for more than 500,000 entries): 139,840 professional from 185 countries and 176,630 from the general Public plus 2,700 journalists from 87 countries and announcements for $140 billion worth of orders.
The air show ended with 866 aircraft commitments totalling $60.9 billion (130 firm orders, 562 LoI/MoU, 119 options and 55 options on LoIs): 388 for Airbus including 243 newly launched A321XLRs and 85 A220s, 232 for Boeing including 200 737 MAXes for IAG, 145 for ATR and 78 for Embraer; 558 narrowbodies, 62 widebodies, 93 regional jets and 153 turboprops.

===2021===

Due to the Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the June 2021 Paris Air Show was cancelled.

===2023===

The air show returns for the first time after the COVID-19 pandemic on 19-25 of June 2023. The first four days are open only to aviation industry followed by three days that include the general public admission. 

== Accidents ==

=== 1961 ===
A Convair B-58 Hustler crashed while doing low-altitude aerobatics. The aircraft reportedly flew into a cloud bank, where visual reference was lost, and crashed, killing 3 on board.

=== 1965 ===
Another Convair B-58 crashed while on final approach during an overweight landing. The aircraft touched down short of the runway, killing United States Air Force Lt. Colonel Charles D. Tubbs. Two other crewmen were injured.

=== 1969 ===
A Fairchild-Hiller FH-1100 helicopter crashed killing the pilot. Witnesses of the crash site seeing &quot;something wrong with the main rotor&quot;.

=== 1973 ===

At the Paris Air Show on June 3, 1973, the second Tupolev Tu-144 production aircraft (registration SSSR-77102) crashed during its display. It stalled while attempting a rapid climb. Trying to pull out of the subsequent dive, the aircraft broke up and crashed, destroying 15 houses and killing all six on board and eight on the ground; a further sixty people received serious injuries.

The cause of this accident remains controversial. Theories include: the Tu-144 climbed to avoid a French Mirage chase plane whose pilot was attempting to photograph it; that changes had been made by the ground engineering team to the auto-stabilisation circuits to allow the Tu-144 to outperform the Concorde in the display circuit; and that the crew were attempting a manoeuvre and to outshine the Concorde.

=== 1977 ===
An A-10 Thunderbolt II crashed killing the pilot.

=== 1989 ===
A Mikoyan MiG-29 crashed during a demonstration flight with no loss of life.

=== 1999 ===
A Sukhoi Su-30 crashed during a demonstration flight with no loss of life.

<text>Chard is a town and a civil parish in the English county of Somerset. It lies on the A30 road near the Devon and Dorset borders, south west of Yeovil. The parish has a population of approximately 14,000 and, at an elevation of , Chard is the southernmost and one of the highest towns in Somerset. Administratively Chard forms part of the district of South Somerset.

The name of the town was &quot;Cerden&quot; in 1065 and &quot;Cerdre&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086. After the Norman Conquest, Chard was held by the Bishop of Wells. The town&#x27;s first charter was from King John in 1234. Most of the town was destroyed by fire in 1577, and it was further damaged during the English Civil War. A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter established Almshouses known as Harvey&#x27;s Hospital. In 1685 during the Monmouth Rebellion, the pretender Duke of Monmouth was proclaimed King in the Town prior to his defeat on Sedgemoor. Chard subsequently witnessed the execution and traitor&#x27;s death of 12 condemned rebels, who, tried by Judge Jeffreys, were hanged near the present Tesco roundabout. The Chard Canal was a tub boat canal built between 1835 and 1842. Chard Branch Line was created in 1860 to connect the two London and South Western Railway and Bristol and Exeter Railway main lines and ran through Chard until 1965.

The town has a very unusual feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. Chard Reservoir, approximately a mile north east of the town, is a Local Nature Reserve, and Snowdon Hill Quarry a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Major employers in the town include Numatic International Limited. There are a range of sporting and cultural facilities, with secondary education being provided at Holyrood Academy; religious sites including the Church of St Mary the Virgin, which dates from the late 11th century.

==History==
The earliest evidence of settlement near Chard is the Iron Age fort of Cotley Castle overlooking the Town near Bound&#x27;s Lane. There was a small Saxon settlement centred round the Church and the area is still known as &#x27;Old Town&#x27;. Chard&#x27;s name was &quot;Cerden&quot; in 1065 and &quot;Cerdre&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086 and it means &quot;house on the chart or rough ground&quot; (Old English: ćeart + renn). Before the Norman Conquest Chard was held by the Bishop of Wells. The town&#x27;s first charter was from King John and another from the bishop in 1234, which delimited the town and laid out burgage holdings in lots at a rent of twelve pence per year. The parish of Chard was part of the Kingsbury Hundred,

Most of the town was destroyed by fire in 1577. After this time the town was largely rebuilt including Waterloo House and Manor Court House in Fore Street which were built as a house and courtroom, and have now been converted into shops and offices. In 2023, the historic Court House building was acquired by Somerset Council to safeguard its future. Further damage to the town took place during the English Civil War with both sides plundering its resources, particularly in 1644 when Charles I spent a week in the town.

A 1663 will by Richard Harvey of Exeter established Almshouses which became Harvey&#x27;s Hospital. These were rebuilt in 1870 largely of stone from previous building. In 1685 during the Monmouth Rebellion, the pretender James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, was proclaimed King in the Town and several locals joined his forces. Commander of the pursuing Royalist army, John Churchill, made a severe cautionary speech to the townsfolk in St Mary&#x27;s. After the rebellion collapsed, Chard witnessed the execution and traitor&#x27;s death of 12 of the Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s rebels, who were summarily tried and condemned at Taunton Castle by Judge Jeffreys. They were hung, drawn and quartered by the &#x27;Handcross tree&#x27; whose site was near the present Tesco roundabout. The tree was removed by the railway in 1864 amid loud local protests.

There was a fulling mill in the town by 1394 for the textile industry. After 1820 this expanded with the town becoming a centre for lace manufacture led by manufacturers who fled from the Luddite resistance they had faced in the English Midlands. Bowden&#x27;s Old Lace Factory and the Gifford Fox factory are examples of the sites constructed. The Guildhall was built as a Corn Exchange and Guildhall in 1834 and is now the Town Hall.

On Snowdon Hill is a small cottage which was originally a toll house built by the Chard Turnpike trust in the 1830s, to collect fees from those using a road up the hill which avoided the steep gradient.
Chard is the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian aeronautical pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham&#x27;s work.

Chard was a key point on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II defensive line consisting of pillboxes and anti-tank obstacles, which runs from Axminster north to the Somerset coast near Highbridge. In 1938 a bomb proof bunker was built behind the branch of the Westminster Bank. During the war it was used to hold duplicate copies of the bank records in case its headquarters in London was destroyed. It was also used to store the emergency bank note supply of the Bank of England. There has also been speculation that the Crown Jewels were also stored there, however this has never been confirmed.

Action Aid, the International Development Charity, had their headquarters in Chard when they started life in 1972 as Action in Distress. The Supporters Services department of the charity is still based in Chard.

Every year, the annual Chard Eating Competition is held with many residents turning out to see who can eat the most. In 2016, local resident Harley Richards, was the winner managing a consecutive 37 hot dogs and nettles. In 2021, she returned, consuming 39 hot dogs and nettles.

==Governance==

Chard was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and remained a municipal borough until the Local Government Act 1972, when it became a successor parish in the Non-metropolitan district of South Somerset. (Somerset will be a unitary authority from 1 April 2023).

The town council (a parish council with the status of a town) has responsibility for local issues. It evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. It initiates projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, and consults with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. It sets an annual precept (local rate) to cover its operating costs and produces annual accounts for public scrutiny. The council has a reception and offices in the Guildhall, a Grade II* listed building. The building was built in 1834 as a corn exchange, replacing an earlier 16th-century building that used to be situated perpendicular to where the current road is in the high street outside the Phoenix Hotel: a dig of the High Street in the late 1980s revealed the original footprint of the old guildhall.

In 2006 Chard Town Council came to the attention of the National Press when Mayor Tony Prior was found guilty of sexual discrimination and victimisation of the Town Clerk. He was ordered to pay £33,000 in compensation. Prior was banned from holding public office for nine months but was returned to council (as an independent Councillor) in a 2010 by-election.

The South Somerset district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, the library, roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

The civil parish of Chard Town (its formal name) contains six electoral wards – Avishayes, coombe, Crimchard, Holyrood, Jocelyn and shepards lane.

Chard is part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

===Twinnings===
Chard is twinned with Helmstedt in Germany (since 12 April 1980), Morangis, Essonne in France (since 29 May 1994) and Șeica Mare in Transylvania, Romania.

==Geography==

At an altitude of , Chard is one of the highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the town eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.

The Chard Reservoir, around a mile northeast of the town, is a Local Nature Reserve. It is used for dog walking, fishing and birdwatching, with a bird hide having been installed. Species which are seen regularly include grey herons, kingfishers, great cormorants, little grebes, ducks and also a wide range of woodland songbirds. Others include the great white egret, cattle egret, and spotted redshank.

Snowdon Hill Quarry is a 0.6 hectare (1.3 acre) geological Site of Special Scientific Interest on the western outskirts. The site shows rock exposures through the Upper Greensand and Chalk, containing fossil crustaceans which are both unique and exceptionally well-preserved making it a key locality for the study of palaeontology in Britain. The unit has been dated to the subdivision of the Chalk known as the Turrilites acutus Zone, named after one of the characteristic fossils, which was laid down in the Middle Cenomanian era between 99.6 ± 0.9 MA and 93.5 ± 0.8 MA (million years ago).

There are also caves in Chard, first recorded in a charter of 1235 as being used by stonemasons, which provided local building stone. The cave is smaller than when it was used as a quarry as part of the roof has fallen in but a cave below ground still exists with the remains of the supporting pillars left when it was being worked.

===Climate===
Along with the rest of South West England, Chard has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Economy==
Textile manufacture was important to the town during the Middle Ages. Chard is the birthplace of powered flight as in 1848 John Stringfellow first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible. Percy and Ernest Petter, who formed Westland Aircraft Works, witnessed some of Stringfellow&#x27;s demonstrations in Chard and often asked for help in the formation of Westland&#x27;s first aircraft development factory on the outskirts of Yeovil. AgustaWestland now holds the Henson and Stringfellow lecture yearly for the Royal Aeronautical Society. James Gillingham developed articulated artificial limbs. Chard is a key point on the Taunton Stop Line, a World War II defensive line.
Chard is the home of Numatic International Limited, notable for its &#x27;Henry&#x27; vacuum cleaners with the characteristic large smiling face. The company employs over 700 people. In contrast to competitors such as Hoover and Dyson the firm continues to manufacture in Britain. The site occupies an area of more than 10 hectares and operates continuously, producing over 4,000 products per day.

Another large employer in Chard was Oscar Mayer, a producer of own-brand packaged ready-meals. (It is distinct from the American company of the same name owned by Kraft Foods). Oscar Mayer employed many Portuguese and, more recently, Polish workers. In 2007 it was announced that the factory would be bought by Icelandic company the Alfesca Group, which owns Lyons seafoods. However this deal fell through and the company announced 250 job losses. Oscar Mayer announced on 22 October 2020 that it was considering ending production at its Chard sites. Following collective consultation with its employees, the company decided to close the Chard sites, with most of the staff employed there becoming redundant. It was expected that the transfer of Oscar Mayer&#x27;s Chard manufacturing business to its other UK sites would be complete by the end of September 2021.

Chard is also home to Brecknell Willis, one of the world&#x27;s oldest and leading specialists in the design, construction and installation of railway electrification systems, most notably metro and light rail systems. Its largest customer, London Underground, purchases both train-borne equipment and infrastructure. Brecknell Willis occupies a site at the bottom of the hill next to the site of the old LSWR station, which is now a Tesco store. At the time of writing (August 2014) the company was preparing to move into a new purpose-built building from which all of its operations will be based. In early July 2014 the company was bought by WABTEC, bringing it into the Wabtec Rail Group as well as the Falstand Electric Group.

==Transport==

From 1842 Chard was the terminus of the Chard Canal, a tub boat canal that joined the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal at Creech St. Michael. It had four aqueducts, three tunnels and four inclined planes along its length. It took seven years to construct and cost about £140,000 (£ in ).

In the 1860s the town became the terminus of two railway lines. The first was opened in 1863 by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) as a short branch line from their main line. This approached the town from the south. The second and longer line was opened by the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&amp;ER) in 1866 and ran northwards, close to the route of the canal, to join their main line near . From 1917 they were both operated by one company, but services were mostly advertised as though it was still two separate lines. It was closed to passengers in 1962 and freight traffic was withdrawn a few years later.

The LSWR&#x27;s station (later known as Chard Town) opened in 1860 with a single platform, and the B&amp;ER&#x27;s (variously known as Chard Joint or ) in 1866. For five years LSWR trains continued to call at Chard Town and then reversed to the connecting line and then resumed their forward journey to the Joint station. In 1871 a new platform was opened on the connecting line; this closed to passengers on 1 January 1917 but the town station was the main goods depot for the town until it finally closed on 18 April 1966. Passenger trains ceased to operate to Chard Central on 11 September 1962, and private goods traffic on 3 October 1966. The station building and train shed still stand and are in use by engineering companies.

The town&#x27;s public transport links to Taunton are now provided by First Group&#x27;s Buses of Somerset. Two routes go between the towns. Route 30 and route 99, which both run hourly during weekdays. There is also a service to Yeovil via Crewkerne provided by South West Coaches

==Sport==
Chard has a number of local sport clubs. Chard Town F.C. play football in the Somerset County League, whilst a number of Chard football clubs play in the Perry Street and District League.
The Rugby union club, Chard RFC, was formed in 1876. The Club runs 3 Senior sides, with the 1stXV playing currently in South West One (west) achieving promotion to National League 3 South West on 26 April 2014 beating Old Towcestrians in the playoff final. Chard Hockey Club was established in 1907 and it now runs three male and three female sides. There are also facilities for cricket, tennis, bowls, darts and golf. The Wessex Pool League is also played in a number of Pubs in Chard, along with the Chard and District Darts League.

==Local media==
Television signals are received from either the Mendip or Stockland Hill TV transmitters.

Radio stations for the area are BBC Radio Somerset on 95.5 FM, Heart West on 97.1 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 106.6 FM and Radio Ninesprings on 104.6 FM.

Local newspapers are the Chard and Ilminster News, Somerset County Gazette, Somerset Guardian and Standard and Somerset Live.

==Education==

The original school building in Fore Street was built in 1583 a private residence for William Symes of Poundisford. In 1671 his youngest son, John, conveyed the property to 12 trustees so that it should be converted into a grammar school – according to his father&#x27;s wish. Today, it is known as Chard School, a private school for children ages 4 to 11.

Avishayes Community Primary School, Manor Court Community Primary School, Tatworth Primary School and The Redstart Primary School all offer primary education, while Holyrood Academy offers secondary education. The school, as of 2019, has 1,276 pupils between the ages of 11 and 18.

==Religious sites==

The Anglican Church of St Mary the Virgin dates from the late 11th century and was rebuilt in the 15th century. The tower contains eight bells, of which two were made in the 1790s by Thomas Bilbie of the Bilbie family in Cullompton. The three-stage tower has moulded string courses and an angle stair turret in the north-west corner. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. There is a church room, built in 1827. The Baptist Church in Holyrood Street was built in 1842.

<doc id="606455" wikidata="Q6444436" url="?curid=606455" title="Kung Fu (Ash song)">
<text>&quot;Kung Fu&quot; is a song by the band Ash, released as the first single from their album, &quot;1977&quot;. It was released in March 1995 as a CD single, limited edition 7-inch, and standard 7-inch vinyl. The song was written by Tim Wheeler and produced by Owen Morris.

==Writing and recording==
The song was written by Tim Wheeler in five minutes on Boxing Day 1994 at Belfast International Airport and recorded in one take on the following day. The song was recorded on the Verve&#x27;s equipment, who were nearby recording their &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; album at the same time.

The song lyrics reference martial arts movie star Jackie Chan and the song was used in the advertising and during the bloopers at the end of the American release of Chan&#x27;s film &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot;. Additionally, the song&#x27;s intro is a sample from kung-fu flick &quot;Close Encounters of the Spooky Kind&quot;, starring Sammo Hung, which was being shown as part of a Channel 4 Kung-Fu film season shown over Christmas of that year. It is Hung&#x27;s voice that can be heard in the sample.

When performed live, &quot;Kung Fu&quot; traditionally closed the band&#x27;s sets in a two-minute rendition but was later moved to an earlier slot in the setlist. On the Nu-Clear Sounds tour, it ran to around 5 minutes, with a DJ filling the song with martial arts and computer game noises. Live versions of the song appear on the &quot;Barbie 7”&quot; EP and the Ash album &quot;Live at the Wireless&quot;.

The song appears on &quot;1977&quot;, &quot;Intergalactic Sonic 7″s&quot;, Ash&#x27;s first greatest hits collection, and the &quot;Tokyo Blitz&quot; DVD. The song appeared with Ash&#x27;s earlier single &quot;Jack Names the Planets&quot; on the film soundtrack of &quot;Angus&quot;.

==B-sides==
The single was backed with two B-sides. The first B-side, &quot;Day of the Triffids&quot;, tells an apocalyptic story of an invasion by aliens, and appears on the &quot;Cosmic Debris&quot; B-sides collection. It also appears on the US version of &quot;Trailer&quot;.

The second B-side, &quot;Luther Ingo&#x27;s Star Cruiser&quot; was written by Wheeler and Mark Hamilton and is infamous for having uncommonly explicit lyrics. This was the B-side of the standard 7-inch vinyl (INFECT 21S) but since it was unsuitable for use in jukeboxes, another version (INFECT 21J) was pressed with &quot;Day of the Triffids&quot; as the B-side. This version was also released as a numbered limited edition.

==Release and reception==
The single reached number 57 on the UK Singles Chart, and the sleeve pictured footballer Eric Cantona&#x27;s kick on a spectator that occurred in January 1995. A music video directed by Steven Wells and Nick Small was also filmed. It consists of the band playing the song in concert, and occasionally footage of different people performing martial arts moves are cut in to the video.

The song was received warmly with &quot;NME&quot; awarding it &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27;, while Eric Cantona&#x27;s kick on a spectator would top &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of Top 50 Most Rock &#x27;n Roll Moments of 1995.

<doc id="606458" wikidata="Q482981" url="?curid=606458" title="Pansori">
<text>() is a Korean genre of musical storytelling performed by a singer and a drummer.

The term &quot;&quot; is compounds of the Korean words and , the latter of which means &quot;sound.&quot; However, &quot;pan&quot; has multiple meanings, and scholars disagree on which was the intended meaning when the term was coined. One meaning is &quot;a situation where many people are gathered.&quot; Another meaning is &quot;a song composed of varying tones.&quot; In music, Gugwangdae describes a long story that takes as little as three hours and as much as eight hours or more. It is one of the traditional forms of Korean music that mixes body movements and songs to the accompaniment of a buk drum played by a gosu. The dramatic content of the drama is changed according to various rhythms based on the melody of Korea&#x27;s local music. Pansori was originally called the &quot;sori&quot;, and it was called Taryeong, Japga (), Clown Song, and Geukga (). It was also commonly used in terms such as Changgeukjo ().

In the late 20th century, the sorrowful &quot;Western style&quot; of &quot;pansori&quot; overtook the vigorous &quot;Eastern style&quot; of &quot;pansori&quot;, and &quot;pansori&quot; began being called the &quot;sound of &quot;han&quot;&quot;. All surviving &quot;pansori&quot; epics end happily, but contemporary &quot;pansori&quot; focuses on the trials and tribulations of the characters, commonly without reaching the happy ending because of the contemporary popularity of excerpt performances. Such changes to the character of &quot;pansori&quot;, including &quot;han&quot;, has led to concern within the traditional performing community.

&quot;Pansori&quot; has been designated as Korea&#x27;s National Intangible Cultural Heritage No. 5 since 1964. On November 7, 2003, &quot;pansori&quot; was registered as the UNESCO&#x27;s Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity of Korea. In 2011, the &quot;pansori&quot; practiced by the ethnic Koreans in China was also nominated as the UNESCO&#x27;s intangible cultural heritage by the governments of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and Tieling.

Originally a form of folk entertainment for the lower classes, &quot;pansori&quot; was embraced by the Korean elite during the 19th century. While public interest in the genre temporarily declined in the mid-20th century, today&#x27;s South Korean publics and government are passionate in registering and recognizing many &quot;pansori&quot; singers as &quot;living national treasures of Korea.&quot; North Korea, on comparison, has yet to implement the systematic support of &quot;pansori&quot; at the government level, as Kim Jong Il believed that &quot;pansori&quot;&#x27;s performance voice was too hoarse and did not distinguish between male and female to suit the taste of today&#x27;s people.

== Name ==
Pansori is a form of musical entertainment that has persisted in Korea from the 17th century to the present day. A related term, &quot;pannoreum,&quot; refers to plays such as Sandae-do Gamgeuk () and geundu (), as well as tightrope walking. The pansori of the Joseon Dynasty included sijo poetry () accompanied by music. Therefore, it is not appropriate to refer to pansori as Changgeuk () or Changgeukjo (). Changgeuk is based on the name of Pansori dramatized after Wongaksa Temple (), but it is not suitable for pure Pansori. Therefore, Changgeukjo is appropriate for the musical term of the song sung in Changgeuk, but it is not appropriate for the form of pansori. 

&quot;Pansori&quot; as a musical term originated independently from the term &quot;pannol&quot; (pannoreum). Likewise, the literary form of this form of pansori is also called pansori. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between pansori as a musical term and pansori as a literary term, but it is still appropriate to use the term &quot;pansori&quot; to refer to sijo. 

== Description ==
Pansori performances are performed by &quot;Clown&quot;, &quot;Gosu&quot;, and &quot;Audience&quot;.

A clown sings with a fan in their right hand, and the singing part and the speaking part intersect. The singing part is called &quot;aniri&quot; or &quot;broader&quot; in terms of sound and speech, which is called &quot;applied&quot; or &quot;spacious.&quot;

Gosu is another important component of the performance that plays drums. As the expression &quot;one Gosu two master singers&quot; is often used, in the soundboard, a singer and a clown lead the game together. The drummer beats the emotional circuit of the song and adds more charm to the performance.

Rather than listening quietly, the audience adds a &quot;Chu-imsae&quot;.

=== &quot;Pansori&quot; repertoire ===
During the 18th century, 12 song cycles, or &quot;madang&quot; (), were established as the repertoire of &quot;pansori&quot; stories. Those stories were compiled in Song Man-jae&#x27;s &quot;Gwanuhi&quot; () and Jeong No-sik&#x27;s &quot;Joseon Changgeuksa&quot; ().

Of the 12 original &quot;madang&quot;, only five are currently performed. They are as follows.
* Chunhyangga
* Simcheongga
* Heungbuga
* Sugungga
* Jeokbyeokga

Contemporary performances of the &quot;madang&quot; differ greatly from the original works. Rather than performing an entire &quot;madang&quot;, which can take up to 10 hours, musicians may only perform certain sections, highlighting the most popular parts of a &quot;madang&quot;.

=== Relationship between Shaman songs and &quot;Pansori&quot; ===
If Pansori comes from a shaman&#x27;s husband, a clown, the musical wish should be saved in their connection. The rhythm of the unearned value shared by &quot;Lee Bo-hyung&quot; is as follows:

1. Sinawi-Gwon: This is called the &quot;Yukja-baegi-jo&quot; and belongs to the southern part of the Han River in Gyeonggi-do and Chungcheong-do and Jeolla-do provinces.

2. Menarizo : This is called an &quot;Sanyuhwa-garak&quot;, and &quot;Gyeongsang-do&quot; and &quot;Gangwon-do&quot; provinces belong to it.

3. Susimga·Sanyeombuljo: &quot;Pyeongan-do&quot; and &quot;Hwanghae-do&quot; provinces

4. Changbu Taryeong ·Noraegarakjo: belong to Muga in northern Gyeonggi Province, Kaesong, Seoul, Cheorwon, and Yangju.

In addition, there is a theory that &quot;Gyeong-dereum&quot; is similar to the rhythm of the northern Gyeonggi Muga&#x27;s Changbu Taryeong.

Again, the rhythm of Pansori has a tempo from the slow beat of Jinyangjo, Jungmori, Jungjungmori, Jajinmori, Hwimori, Ujungmori, etc. It is necessary to value the term &quot;Mori&quot; that appears here. In other words, if you compare Salpuri Gut in Jeolla-do Province, which is called Sinai Gijo, and Do Salmori, Balae in Gyeonggi-do and Chungcheong-do provinces, the sound of goso sung by clowns is Jungmori, especially in old Hongpagosa and Antaek.

Therefore, it is the Muga of Hongpae Gosa, Seongjo, and Antaek, which are called by this southern clown, that is, the theory that pansori was produced in the clowns of Chungcheong-do. This is a problem that needs to be further clarified in the future, but even from this, it can be seen that the reasoning that pansori came from the reading voice that some argue is vain. Since clowns are folk singers, it would be right to say that they assimilated various folk songs based on the rhythm of these mugas and completed them. However, even if the song was originally adopted at the time of its establishment, it would have refined it in the process of transmission and developed a new style as a pansori, which seems to be the result of this effort.

== History ==
=== Origins: 17th century ===
&quot;Pansori&quot; is thought to have originated in the late 17th century during the Joseon Dynasty. The earliest performers of &quot;pansori&quot; were most likely shamans and street performers, and their audiences were lower-class people. It is unclear where in the Korean peninsula &quot;pansori&quot; originated, but the Honam region eventually became the site of its development.

=== Expansion and golden age: 18th–19th centuries ===
It is believed that &quot;pansori&quot; was embraced by the upper classes around the mid-18th century. One piece of evidence that supports this belief is that Yu Jin-han, a member of the &quot;yangban&quot; upper class, recorded the text of &quot;Chunhyangga,&quot; a famous &quot;pansori&quot; he saw performed in Honam in 1754, indicating that the elite attended &quot;pansori&quot; performances by this time.

The golden age of &quot;pansori&quot; is considered to be the 19th century when the genre&#x27;s popularity increased and its musical techniques became more advanced. During the first half of the 19th century, &quot;pansori&quot; singers incorporated folk songs into the genre, while using vocal techniques and melodies intended to appeal to the upper class. Purely humorous &quot;pansori&quot; also became less popular than &quot;pansori&quot; that combined humorous and tragic elements.

Major developments in this period were made by &quot;pansori&quot; researcher and patron Shin Jae-hyo. He reinterpreted and compiled songs to fit the tastes of the upper class and also trained the first notable female singers, including Jin Chae-seon, who is considered to be the first female master of &quot;pansori&quot;.

Western performing arts first made their way to Korea in the late nineteenth century. Jeong Du-won brought Western music concept to Korea for the first time in 1632. He became familiar with Western music via the teachings of Chinese Catholic priests. Lee Eun-Dol, the first Korean to study western music at the Japanese Army&#x27;s staff sergeant school, began coaching bugle bands in Seoul in 1882. Seo Sang&#x27;s 1884 presentation of Yun&#x27;s religious music, notably protestant songs, also had a considerable effect.

=== Decline: early 20th century ===
In the early 20th century, &quot;pansori&quot; experienced several notable changes. It was more frequently performed indoors and staged similarly to Western operas. It was recorded and sold on vinyl records for the first time. The number of female singers grew rapidly, supported by organizations of &quot;kisaeng&quot;. And the tragic tone of &quot;pansori&quot; was intensified, due to the influence of the Japanese occupation of Korea on the Korean public and performers. In an attempt to suppress Korean culture, the Japanese government often censored &quot;pansori&quot; that referred to the monarchy or to Korean nationalism.

=== Preservation and resurgence: late 20th century to present ===
In addition to Japanese censorship, the rise of cinema and &quot;changgeuk&quot;, and the turmoil of the Korean War all contributed to &quot;pansori&#x27;s&quot; decreasing popularity by the mid-20th century. To help preserve the tradition of &quot;pansori,&quot; the South Korean government declared it an Intangible Cultural Property in 1964. Additionally, performers of &quot;pansori&quot; began to be officially recognized as &quot;living national treasures.&quot; This contributed to a resurgence of interest in the genre beginning in the late 1960s.

UNESCO proclaimed the &quot;pansori&quot; tradition a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on November 7, 2003.

The number of pansori performers has increased substantially in the 21st century, though the genre has struggled to find wide public appeal, and &quot;pansori&quot; audiences are composed mostly of older people, scholars or students of traditional music, and the elite. However, &quot;pansori&quot; fusion music, a trend that began in the 1990s, has continued in the 21st century, with musicians creating combinations including &quot;pansori-&quot;reggae, &quot;pansori&quot;-classical music, and &quot;pansori&quot;-rap.

Orthodox Pansori performances in well-known places and on traditional theater stages are commonplace. Tradition-based theater and full-length performances in one of the many recognized specialty sectors of Orthodox Pansori are all included within the government of Korea&#x27;s cultural conservation program, which includes Orthodox Pansori. The performances take place on well-known theater stages, recalling the excitement of older times of court and market entertainment. On the other side, dramatic platforms raise the performers above the audience. In the past, Pansori gave equal importance to the performers and the audience.

Touristic Pansori is a term that refers to renowned Pansori singers doing short acts of the traditional Pansori performance with other kinds of music, such as religious music. Often, the many short performances have nothing in common, like when court music or religious dances are combined with Pansori. International visitors and visitors from other regions of Korea make up the bulk of the audience. The objective is to make Pansori accessible to a broad audience that is unfamiliar with its norms or with the significance of the tradition to the Korean people.

There are recent Pansori-themed films such as &quot;Seopyeonje (1993), &quot;Hwimori (1994)&quot; and &quot;The Millennium Studies (2007)&quot;.

== Elements and styles ==
There are five elements for the musical style of &quot;pansori&quot;: &quot;jo&quot; (); &quot;jangdan&quot; (); &quot;buchimsae&quot; (); &quot;je&quot; (); and vocal production.
* &quot;Jo&quot; (, also spelled &quot;cho&quot;) refers mostly to the melodic framework of a performance. In terms of music in Western culture, it comparable to the mode and key, though &quot;jo&quot; also includes the vocal timbre and emotions expressed through singing. Types of &quot;jos&quot; include: chucheonmok (); Gyemyeonjo (; also called &quot;seoreumjo&quot; , &quot;aewonseong&quot; ); seokhwaje (); and seolleongje ().
* &quot;Jangdan&quot; () is the rhythmic structure used. &quot;Jangdan&quot; is used to show emotional states corresponding to the narration of the singer. &quot;Jangdan&quot; is also used with the appearances of certain characters. Some types include: &quot;jinyang&quot; (); &quot;jungjungmori&quot; (); &quot;jajinmori&quot; (); and &quot;hwimori&quot; ()
* &quot;Buchimsae&quot; () refers to the method in which words in &quot;pansori&quot; are combined with the melodies. The meaning refers more specifically to combinations of words with irregular rhythms. The word is a combination of two Korean words, &quot;buchida&quot; () and &quot;sae&quot; (). The two types of &quot;buchimsae&quot; are: &quot;daemadi daejangdan&quot; () and &quot;eotbuchim&quot; ().
* &quot;Je&quot; () refers to a style of &quot;pansori&quot;.

=== Styles ===
Pansori&#x27;s style originated from the division of relations and regions of origin, with the establishment of the flow, singing and theory of each song over a long period of time, leading to the formation of several small branches that diverged from the great stem. Pansori&#x27;s style was largely classified as the two major mountains of East and West Pyeonje, and expressing style in Pansori was in line with the classification of Yupa in Sijo, Yeongje, Wanje, and Naepoje.

Pansori can be divided into , in addition to and , depending on the region.

Dongpyeonje was based on Unbong, Gurye, Sunchang, and Heungdeok areas, which are east of the Seomjingang River, and it is magnificent and vigorous, and features a simple display of natural volume without any finesse. Aniri has not developed for a long time, has little application, and is a sound material that is carried out by relying on the voice of the neck. Instead of &quot;the Great Leader,&quot; they stick together to the rhythm.

Seopyeonje refers to the sound of Confucian scholars in Naju, Haenam, and Boseong, west of the Seomjingang River, and is the standard of Park Yu-jeon&#x27;s legislation. The musical characteristics are mainly used to portray sad and resentful feelings, and to portray sophisticated, colorful, and tantalizing sounds.

Junggoje is another style, where the sound begins at a medium tone and starts flat at a relatively low voice when the window is opened, increases the middle, and lowers the voice when the limit is reached. It is clear that the sound is high and low, so you can hear it clearly, and the tune is monotonous and simple.

== Pansori&#x27;s Mok and Sung ==
In Pansori, a person&#x27;s voice quality, singing style, and the type of tune is called by a certain ‘Mok’ and ‘Sung’. Usually, the ‘Mok’ is deeply related to the type of tune and singing, and the ’Sung’ is deeply related to the quality of sound.

Norang Mok means to lightly vocalize and dye the tune, which means to use the decoration or singing method. But master singers are reluctant to do so. Waega-jip Mok means to the use of a tone or temporary listening rather than the general composition of that tone.

Soori Sung refers to the sound quality of a master singer who is a bit rough and hoarse. Examples include Song Man-gap and Jeong Jeong-ryul.

== Pansori masterpiece singer ==
Pansori masterpiece refers to a person who sings exceptionally well in the intestines of Pansori.

The best literature of Pansori is &quot;Chunhyangga,&quot; which was published in &quot;The Cartoon House&quot; by Yu Jin (1711-1791).

The best singers of Pansori were Uchundae, Kwon Sam-deuk, and Moheung-gap, which appeared in &quot;Guanwoohee&quot; of Song Man-jae, and Hahandam, which appeared in &quot;Gapsin Wanmun&quot;, and were from the reign of King Yeongjo and King Jeongjo of modern Joseon. There must have been a masterpiece of pansori even before Uchundae and Haundam, but it remains only in the literature or is not oralized.

During the reign of King Sunjo, outstanding masters came out to form various groups in pansori, including Kwon Sam-deuk, Hwanghaecheon, Songheungrok, Bangmanchun, Yeom Gye-dal, Moheunggap, Kim Gye-cheol, Gosogwan, Sin Man-yeop, Song Gwang-rok, and Judeokgi. Eight of these are called eight people. The names of these master singers are also seen in Shin Jae-hyo&#x27;s &quot;The Clown.&quot; From this time on, a &quot;sori clown&quot; focusing on sound appeared, distinguishing it from a traditional &quot;aniri clown&quot; focusing on &quot;aniri.&quot;

The early days of King Cheoljong and King Gojong corresponded to the heyday of pansori. Famous singers such as Park Yu-jeon, Park Man-soon, Lee Il-chi, Kim Se-jong, Song Woo-ryong, Jeong Start-up, Jung Chun-pung, Kim Chang-rok, Jang Ja-baek, Kim Chan-up, and Lee Chang-yoon came out to lead Pansori to a highly artistic level. They formed various factions based on the relationship between private affairs and regional delay, and eight of them were selected as the late eight singers.

At the end of King Gojong&#x27;s reign and at the beginning of his schedule, Pansori was the fruit of Pansori. On the other hand, after Wonggeuk became popular after Wongaksa Temple, Pansori began to sprout. As the master singers of each region moved in and out of each other, pansori&#x27;s yupa gradually lost its distinctiveness. The famous singers who were active during this period include Park Ki-hong, Kim Chang-hwan, Kim Chae-man, Song Man-gap, Lee Dong-baek, Yu Gong-ryul, Jeon Do-seong, Kim Chang-ryong, Yoo Seong-jun, and Jeong-ryul. Five of these master singers are called five master singers.

Right behind the five singers were Jang Pan-gae, Yi Sun-yu, Kim Jeong-moon, Park Jung-geun, Gong Chang-sik, Yi Hwa Jung-sun, Im Bo-le, and Gang Jang-won. They played a major role in the Joseon Vocal Research Society, but were swept away by Changgeuk and pushed by Western music, and Pansori began to retreat.

Later master singers include Park Nok-ju, Kim Yeon-soo, Jeong Gwang-soo, Kim Yeo-ran, Park Cho-wol, Kim So-hee, Park Bong-sul, Park Dong-jin, Jung Kwon-jin, Han Seung-ho, Han Ae-soon, and Jang Young-chan. They are trying to revive the disappearing pansori, but they are in danger of disappearing without proper measures from the government and society. Among them, Kim So-hee, Park Cho-wol, Park Bong-sul, Park Nok-ju, Kim Yeon-soo, Jeong Gwang-soo, Kim Yeo-ran, Jeong Gwon-jin, and Han Seung-ho were designated as intangible cultural assets.

After the death of the first generation of national intangible cultural assets, Jo Sang-hyeon, Park Song-hee, Song Soon-seop, Seongwuhyang, Sung Chang-soon, Oh Jeong-sook, Han Nong-seon, Namhae-seong, Shin Yeong-hee, and Kim Il-gu were designated as second generation intangible cultural assets. Following them, Jeong Soon-im, Kim Soo-yeon, Kim Young-ja, Inancho, Jeong Hoe-seok, and Yoon Jin-cheol were designated as third-generation national intangible cultural assets. In addition, there are numerous master singers such as Yoo Soo-jeong, Wang Ki-chul, Chae Soo-jeong, Yoo Mi-ri, Lee Ju-eun, Yeom Kyung-ae, and Jang Moon-hee.

== Themes ==
The stories described in Pansori all link to a distinct moral issue of people: Chunhyangga, Simcheongga, and Heungboga. Each tale teaches a valuable lesson and illustrates the ancient Koreans&#x27; believe in karma in their own unique way.

Chunhyang relates the tale of a girl who was born into a humble household but transformed herself after marrying the governor&#x27;s son. She subsequently rejected and resisted another governor&#x27;s pressure. The narrative concludes with her husband rescuing her when she demonstrates the purity, love, and unity of individuals from many social classes.

Simcheongga emphasizes filial piety, chastity, and fortitude. Simcheong was freed by the King of the Sea as a compassion act, and she met and married the king of her realm, whom she had sacrificed herself to restore his sight. When she organizes a blind party, she stumbles across his father. Her father&#x27;s sight is restored as a result of her tremendous love and devotion. The song underlines the significance of parents and children developing a solid bond.

Heungboga&#x27;s lessons underscore the pitfalls of human avarice. Heungbo&#x27;s aid to a swallow with a broken leg pays off. His wicked brother, too, breaks a swallow&#x27;s leg and does lovely things, but he pays for his actions. In this song, morality and goodness are praised, while wickedness is punished. This song teaches people this.

== Pansori Changbon ==
&quot;Pansori&quot; is one of Korea&#x27;s unique art forms that convey theatrical effects to those who see it as a sound in line with Gosu&#x27;s drumming while clowns holding Hapjukseon in one hand beautifully and mixing all kinds of broadness. Just as there must be a script for the play to be staged, there must be a Pansori editorial before that to make Pansori sound by clowns, and the document that records the Pansori editorial is called the Pansori Changbon. In other words, in pansori, Changbon has the characteristics of a play in a play.

However, there is a great feature in the Pansori version that plays do not have, which is that plays can be performed by anyone, while there is a specific version of the Pansori version for clowns. These windows are called &quot;famous&quot; and are distinguished from &quot;unknown&quot; versions without specific clowns. For example, &quot;Song Man-gap Changbon&quot; refers to the Pansori document sung by Song Man-gap. However, Song Man-gap is not his own creative work. Of course, it may be the work of a clown himself, but it is usually built by an outstanding scholar or supporter. Because most clowns had no writing skills. Thus, the established versions are usually oral transcriptions, which have been inherited from later generations, or were built by civil servants for certain clowns.

The original version of Pansori is sometimes produced in various ways during the transmission process. In other words, there is a slight (sometimes significant) variation in the content of the book, which has been handed down for hundreds of years to this day. For example, the early &quot;Chunhyangga&quot; could have been sung in three hours, but today, the content was greatly added enough to sing eight and a half hours.

Even if the original version of Pansori is the original copy of Dongil genealogy, many versions are gradually derived. As the first literature on the twelve yards of pansori, Song Man-jae&#x27;s &quot;Gwanwoohee&quot; is currently cited, and there is no way to know which clown it belonged to before the 1810s because there is no technology on the original version. This does not mean that there is a clear record in the post-1810 literature. However, there are several copies or copies of the transcripts held by individuals because they are based on the oral tradition.

Musical storytelling of literatures like &quot;pansori&quot; was a concept that was prevalent in both the East and the West during the ancient times.

In Vietnam, the ca tru singing (, , &quot;tally card songs&quot;), also known as hát cô đầu or hát nói, is a Vietnamese genre of musical storytelling performed by a featuring female vocalist, with origins in northern Vietnam. For much of its history, it was associated with a pansori-like form of entertainment, which combined entertaining wealthy people as well as performing religious songs for the royal court.

In Europe, there was also a group of minstrel poets after the Middle Ages. In France, the matrimonial poem &quot;changson de geste&quot; was sung by monks in non-Latin slang (lingua romana) for pilgrims, and romance was also developed in the form of singing for several people in squares and salons. This form of epic poetry created by the collaboration of literature and music was of any people. This is a common medieval literary form from the 10th century to the 14th and 5th centuries, and Korean pansori is characterized by novels formed by letters first, and this pansori form was characterized by the 18th century.

<doc id="606459" wikidata="Q5110310" url="?curid=606459" title="Christian churches and churches of Christ">
<text>The group of churches known as the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ is a fellowship of congregations within the Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Movement and the Reformation of the 19th Century) that have no formal denominational affiliation with other congregations, but still share many characteristics of belief and worship. Churches in this tradition are strongly congregationalist and have no formal denominational ties, and thus there is no proper name that is agreed upon and applied to the movement as a whole. Most (but not all) congregations in this tradition include the words &quot;Christian Church&quot; or &quot;Church of Christ&quot; in their congregational name. Due to the lack of formal organization between congregations, there is a lack of official statistical data, but the 2016 &quot;Directory of the Ministry&quot; documents some 5000 congregations in the US and Canada; some estimate the number to be over 6,000 since this directory is unofficial. By 1988, the movement had 1,071,616 members in the United States. 

In 2010, the movement had grown to 1,453,160 members within 5,293 churches in the USA. By 2020, the movement had declined to 1,379,041 members in the United States in 4,787 churches. 

These congregations share historical roots with other, similarly named congregations within the Restoration Movement, including congregations organized within formal fellowships, such as the &quot;Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)&quot; or the &quot;Churches of Christ&quot;. The congregations discussed in this article, however, have chosen to remain fully autonomous. Further distinguishing these congregations is their use of instrumental music within their worship, unlike the &quot;Churches of Christ&quot; who do not use instrumental music. The instrumental congregations discussed here and the &quot;a cappella&quot; &quot;Churches of Christ&quot; are otherwise very similar but have little contact with each other in most communities, although there is some cooperation among some larger churches and also in some educational institutions.

==Congregational nomenclature==

The churches are independent and typically go by the name &quot;Christian Church&quot;, but often use the name &quot;Church of Christ&quot; as well. Though isolated exceptions may occur, it is generally agreed within the movement that no personal or family names should be attached to a congregation which Christ purchased and established with his own blood, though geographical labels are acceptable. Thus, it is common for a congregation to be known as &quot;&quot;[City Name]&quot; Christian Church,&quot; but in some areas they may be known as &quot;[The/First] Christian Church [of/at] &quot;[City, Community, or Other Location Name]&quot;.&quot; In recent history, individual congregations have made the decision to change their formal name to break with traditional nomenclature and to adopt more generic names like &quot;Christ&#x27;s Church [of/at] &quot;[City Name]&quot;, &quot;[City Name]&quot; Community Christian Church&quot;, or &quot;&quot;[City Name]&quot; Community Fellowship&quot;. The tendency in Restoration churches to choose names such as &quot;Christian Church&quot; and &quot;Church of Christ&quot; can cause difficulties in identifying the affiliation (if any) of an individual church based solely on its name. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for churches outside of the Restoration Movement to use similar names (see Church of Christ (disambiguation)).

==Separation from the Disciples of Christ==
The separation of the independent Christian churches and churches of Christ from the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) (DoC) occurred over an extended period of time. The roots of the separation date back to a polarization that occurred during the early twentieth century as the result of three significant controversies. These controversies surrounded theological modernism, the impact of the ecumenical movement, and open membership (recognizing as full members individuals who had not been baptized by immersion).

The Disciples of Christ were, in 1910, a united, growing community with common goals. Support by the United Christian Missionary Society of missionaries who advocated open membership became a source of contention in 1920. Efforts to recall support for these missionaries failed in a 1925 convention in Oklahoma City and a 1926 convention in Memphis, Tennessee. Many congregations withdrew from the missionary society as a result.

A new convention, the North American Christian Convention, was organized by the more conservative congregations in 1927. An existing brotherhood journal, the &quot;Christian Standard&quot;, also served as a source of cohesion for these congregations. From the 1960s on, newer unaffiliated missionary organizations like the Christian Missionary Fellowship (today, Christian Missionary Fellowship International) were working more on a national scale to rally Christian Church/Church of Christ congregations in international missions. By this time the division between liberals and conservatives was well established.

The official separation between the independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) is difficult to date. Suggestions range from 1926 to 1971 based on the events outlined below:

* 1926: The first North American Christian Convention (NACC) in 1927 was the result of disillusionment at the DoC Memphis Convention.
* 1944: International Convention of Disciples elects as president a proponent of open membership.
* 1948: The Commission on Restudy, appointed to help avoid a split, disbands.
* 1955: The Directory of the Ministry was first published listing only the &quot;Independents&quot; on a voluntary basis.
* 1968: Final redaction of the Disciples Year Book removing Independent churches
* 1971: Independent churches listed separately in the Yearbook of American Churches.

==Identity==
Because the Christian churches and churches of Christ are independent congregations there is no set creed, but The Directory of the Ministry contains the following general description:

Members of Christian Churches and churches of Christ believe in the deity and Lordship of Jesus Christ, the inspiration of the Bible, and the autonomy of local congregations. Following the basic principles of the &#x27;Restoration Movement&#x27;, they accept and teach believers&#x27; baptism by immersion into Christ for the forgiveness of sins; they assemble for worship on the first day of the week, also following Biblical example or inference regarding observance of the Lord&#x27;s Supper part of worship. Worship also includes congregational a cappella singing of hymns, prayer, free-will monetary contribution (from the local congregation&#x27;s members) as well as preaching of the Gospel, frequently in concert with other applicable Bible-based topics. They seek the unity of all believers on the basis of faith in and obedience to Christ as the divine Son of God and the acceptance of the Bible particularly the New Testament as their all-sufficient rule of faith and practice.
==Baptism==

Of the principles cited above, one characteristic marks most Christian Churches and Churches of Christ as distinctly different from other modern Evangelical Christian groups. That is the teaching that a person receives the remission of sins at the point of his or her baptism.

==Educational institutions==
The Christian Churches/churches of Christ support a variety of Bible colleges and seminaries. Because there is no official &quot;denominational&quot; structure in the movement, the local colleges often serve as information centers and allow the local churches to maintain connections with each other.

==Creeds and slogans==
A number of creeds and slogans have been used in the Restoration Movement to express some of the distinctive themes of the Movement. These include:

* &quot;Where the Scriptures speak, we speak; where the Scriptures are silent, we are silent.&quot;
* &quot;The church of Jesus Christ on earth is essentially, intentionally, and constitutionally one.&quot;
* &quot;We are Christians only, but not the only Christians.&quot;
* &quot;In essentials, unity; in opinions, liberty; in all things love.&quot;
* &quot;No creed but Christ, no book but the Bible, no law but love, no name but the divine.&quot;
* &quot;Call Bible things by Bible names.&quot;

<doc id="606463" wikidata="Q507606" url="?curid=606463" title="Andrew Smith (zoologist)">
<text>Sir Andrew Smith (3 December 1797 – 11 August 1872) was a British surgeon, explorer, ethnologist and zoologist. He is considered the father of zoology in South Africa having described many species across a wide range of groups in his major work, &quot;Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa&quot;.

Smith was born in Hawick, Roxburghshire. He qualified in medicine at the University of Edinburgh obtaining an M.D. degree in 1819, having joined the Army Medical Services in 1816.

==South Africa 1820–1837==

In 1820 he was ordered to the Cape Colony and was sent to Grahamstown to supervise the medical care of European soldiers and soldiers of the Cape Corps. He was appointed the Albany district surgeon in 1822 and started the first free dispensary for indigent patients in South Africa. He led a scientific expedition into the interior and was able to indulge in his interests of natural history and anthropology. On several occasions, he was sent by governors on confidential missions to visit Bantu tribes beyond the frontier, such as his trip to Kaffraria in 1824 when he made copious notes on the customs of the Xhosa tribes. In 1825 the Governor of the Cape Colony, Lord Charles Somerset, nominated Smith as the first Superintendent of the South African Museum of natural history in Cape Town. In 1828 Smith was sent to Namaqualand by Lieutenant-Governor of the Eastern District of the Cape of Good Hope Richard Bourke to report on the Bushmen there. As a result, Smith wrote &quot;On the origin and history of the Bushmen&quot; in 1831. In the same year of 1831, there were rumours of serious unrest in the east, causing Governor Sir Lowry Cole to send Smith to Natal in January 1832. Here he interviewed Dingaan and reported back to Cole, arousing a great deal of interest in the business world of the Cape. It was mainly his report that caused Britain to annex Port Natal in 1844 and turn it into a Crown colony. Similarly in 1833 the reports of traders from North of the Orange River led to an 18-month-long expedition by Andrew to Basutoland, Kuruman, the headquarters of Mzilikazi and as far north as the Magaliesberg, Charles Davidson Bell going along as expedition artist. Smith returned with two of Mzilikazi&#x27;s izinDuna who forged an alliance with the Cape Colony on behalf of their chief. Smith&#x27;s &quot;Report of the expedition for exploring Central Africa&quot; was published in 1836. Except for two short reports that appeared after his return to Cape Town from the interior in 1836, no detailed account of his travels was ever published. Smith&#x27;s diary, however, was later edited by Percival R. Kirby and published by the Van Riebeeck Society in 1939–40 as Nos. 20 and 21 of their first series, under the title &quot;The Diary of Dr. Andrew Smith, Director of the &#x27;Expedition for Exploring Central Africa&#x27;, 1834–36.&quot; (.)

Smith met the young geologist Charles Darwin when the second voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot; touched at the Cape in May 1836, and showed him slate rock formations. He also gave Darwin some rock samples he had collected the year before. These are now held by the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences. Darwin and Smith corresponded about how the large animals in South Africa lived on sparse vegetation, showing that a lack of luxuriant vegetation did not explain the extinction of the giant creatures whose fossils Darwin had found in South America. Darwin frequently mentioned Smith in his writings, and sponsored him to gain membership of the Royal Society in 1857.

==Britain 1837–1872==
Smith returned to the United Kingdom in January 1837 and shortly afterward started publishing the five volumes making up &quot;Illustrations of the Zoology of South Africa&quot; (1838–50). He advanced rapidly through the ranks of the medical service, becoming staff surgeon and principal medical officer at Fort Pitt, Chatham in 1841. In 1844 he married his housekeeper Ellen Henderson and converted to her Roman Catholic faith. In 1845 he became assistant to Sir James McGrigor, the director-general of the army medical department, becoming Director-General of the Army Medical Services in 1853 when Sir James retired. He was responsible for the organizing of medical services during the Crimean War, amidst serious charges of inefficiency and incompetence from &quot;The Times&quot; and Florence Nightingale. A commission of inquiry exonerated him and he received honours from universities and learned societies. Ill-health forced his resignation, he was succeeded by Thomas Alexander, in 1858 when he was created Knight Commander of the Bath.

<doc id="606465" wikidata="Q1152199" url="?curid=606465" title="Midden">
<text>A midden is an old dump for domestic waste. It may consist of animal bones, human excrement, botanical material, mollusc shells, potsherds, lithics (especially debitage), and other artifacts and ecofacts associated with past human occupation.

These features provide a useful resource for archaeologists who wish to study the diets and habits of past societies. Middens with damp, anaerobic conditions can even preserve organic remains in deposits as the debris of daily life are tossed on the pile. Each individual toss will contribute a different mix of materials depending upon the activity associated with that particular toss. During the course of deposition sedimentary material is deposited as well. Different mechanisms, from wind and water to animal digs, create a matrix which can also be analysed to provide seasonal and climatic information. In some middens individual dumps of material can be discerned and analysed.

==Shells==
A shell midden or shell mound is an archaeological feature consisting mainly of mollusc shells. The Danish term &quot;køkkenmøddinger&quot; (plural) was first used by Japetus Steenstrup to describe shell heaps and continues to be used by some researchers. A midden, by definition, contains the debris of human activity, and should not be confused with wind- or tide-created beach mounds. Some shell middens are processing remains: areas where aquatic resources were processed directly after harvest and prior to use or storage in a distant location.

Some shell middens are directly associated with villages, as a designated village dump site. In other middens, the material is directly associated with a house in the village. Each household would dump its garbage directly outside the house. In all cases, shell middens are extremely complex and very difficult to excavate fully and exactly. The fact that they contain a detailed record of what food was eaten or processed and many fragments of stone tools and household goods makes them invaluable objects of archaeological study.

Shells have a high calcium carbonate content, which tends to make the middens alkaline. This slows the normal rate of decay caused by soil acidity, leaving a relatively high proportion of organic material (food remnants, organic tools, clothing, human remains) available for archaeologists to find.

Edward Sylvester Morse conducted one of the first archaeological excavations of the Omori Shell Mounds in Tokyo, Japan in 1877, which led to the discovery of a style of pottery described as &quot;cord-marked&quot;, translated as &quot;Jōmon&quot;, which came to be used to refer to the early period of Japanese history when this style of pottery was produced. Shell middens were studied in Denmark in the latter half of the 19th century. The Danish word &quot;køkkenmødding&quot; (kitchen mound) is now used internationally. The English word &quot;midden&quot; (waste mound) derives from the same Old Norse word that produced the modern Danish one.

===Examples===
Shell middens are found in coastal or lakeshore zones all over the world. Consisting mostly of mollusc shells, they are interpreted as being the waste products of meals eaten by nomadic groups or hunting parties. Some are small examples relating to meals had by a handful of individuals, others are many metres in length and width and represent centuries of shell deposition. In Brazil, they are known as &quot;sambaquis&quot;, having been created over a long period between the 6th millennium BCE and the beginning of European colonisation.

European shell middens are primarily found along the Atlantic seaboard and in Denmark and primarily date to the 5th millennium BCE (Ertebølle and Early Funnel Beaker cultures), containing the remains of the earliest Neolithisation process (pottery, cereals and domestic animals). Younger shell middens are found in Latvia (associated with Comb Ware ceramics), Sweden (associated with Pitted Ware ceramics), the Netherlands (associated with Corded Ware ceramics) and Schleswig-Holstein (Late Neolithic and Iron Age). All these are examples where communities practised a mixed farming and hunting/gathering economy.

On Canada&#x27;s west coast, there are shell middens that run for more than along the coast and are several meters deep. The midden in Namu, British Columbia is over deep and spans over 10,000 years of continuous occupation.

Shell middens created in coastal regions of Australia by Indigenous Australians exist in Australia today. Middens provide evidence of prior occupation and are generally protected from mining and other developments. One must exercise caution in deciding whether one is examining a midden or a beach mound. There are good examples on the Freycinet Peninsula in Tasmania where wave action currently is combining charcoal from forest fire debris with a mix of shells into masses that storms deposit above high-water mark. Shell mounds near Weipa in far north Queensland that are mostly less than high (although ranging up to high) and a few tens of metres long are claimed to be middens, but are in fact shell cheniers (beach ridges) re-worked by nest mound-building birds. Some shell middens are regarded as sacred sites, linked to the Dreamtime, such as those of the Anbarra group of the Burarra people of Arnhem Land.

<doc id="606466" wikidata="Q3096142" url="?curid=606466" title="Haliotis cracherodii">
<text>Haliotis cracherodii, the black abalone, is a species of large edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Haliotidae, the abalone.

This species is relatively small compared with most of the other abalone species from the eastern Pacific, and it has a relatively smooth dark shell.

This used to be the most abundant large marine mollusk on the west coast of North America, but now, because of overfishing and the withering syndrome, it has much declined in population and the IUCN Red List has classed the black abalone as Critically Endangered.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Haliotis cracherodii&quot; comprises two subspecies:
*&quot;Haliotis cracherodii californiensis&quot; (synonyms: &quot;Haliotis bonita&quot; ; &quot;Haliotis californiensis&quot; )
*&quot;Haliotis cracherodii cracherodii&quot; (synonyms: &quot;Haliotis expansa&quot; ; &quot;Haliotis holzneri&quot; ; &quot;Haliotis imperforata&quot; ; &quot;Haliotis lusus&quot; ; &quot;Haliotis rosea&quot; ; &quot;Haliotis splendidula&quot; )

==Description==

The coloration is dark brown, dark green, dark blue or almost black. The silvery interior of the shell shows a pale pinkish and greenish iridescence. The exterior of the shell is smoother than most abalone, or may have low obsolete coarse spiral lirae and lines of growth. The shell is oval, evenly convex, the two sides equally curved. The back of the shell is regularly convex, with little algal growth. The shell is not carinated at the row of holes. The spire is near the margin. The cavity of the spire is minute, concealed or nearly so. The muscle scar is generally not distinct. There are usually five to seven small, open respiratory holes, or pores, along the left side of the shell and the rims of the holes are flush with the rest of the shell. These holes collectively make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows. The columellar plate is not truncate below, sloping inward, its face concave. The rear of the shell is spiralled, and the mantle, foot and tentacles are black. The interior of the shell is pearly with pink and green iridescence.

The black abalone&#x27;s shell length can reach a maximum of , being typically long.
In the living animal, the tentacles on the epipodium, the mantle, and the foot are black.

==Distribution==
Black abalone can be found along the Pacific coast of the United States from Mendocino County, California to Cabo San Lucas, Baja California, Mexico.

Prehistoric distribution has been confirmed along much of this range from archaeological recovery at a variety of Pacific coastal Native American sites. For example, Chumash peoples in central California were known to have been harvesting black abalone approximately a millennium earlier in the Morro Bay area.

The subspecies &quot;Haliotis cracherodii californiensis&quot; is found around Guadalupe Island, off Baja California (Mexico).

==Ecology==
===Habitat===

Black abalone cling to rocky surfaces in the low intertidal zone, up to 6 m deep. They can typically be found wedged into crevices, cracks, and holes during low tide. They generally occur in areas of moderate to high surf. Juveniles tend to reside in crevices to reduce their risk of predation, but the larger adults will move out onto rock surfaces.

===Life cycle===

Black abalone reach sexual maturity at 3 years and can live 30 years or more. Spawning occurs in spring and early summer; occasionally, a second spawn occurs in the fall. Black abalone are broadcast spawners, and successful spawning requires that individuals be grouped closely together. Larvae are free-swimming for between 5 and 14 days before they settle onto hard substrate, usually near larger individuals, where they then metamorphose into their adult form, develop a shell and settle onto a rock. Juveniles do not tend to disperse great distances, and current populations of black abalone are generally composed of individuals that were spawned locally. Juveniles settle in crevices and remain hidden until they reach approximately 4 inches in length. At that point, adults congregate in more exposed areas such as rocks and in tide pools. They are thought to be able to live for between 25 and 75 years, and will begin to reproduce between three and seven years.

===Feeding habits===
Black abalone are herbivorous gastropods, and feed mostly on drift algae and kelp. Their primary food species depend on the habitat. In southern California habitats, black abalone are thought to feed on the giant kelp (&quot;Macrocystis pyrifera&quot;) and feather boa kelp (&quot;Egregia menziesii&quot;), while in central and northern California habitats they feed on the bull kelp (&quot;Nereocystis leutkeana&quot;).

===Interspecific relationships===
Predators of this species other than mankind are sea otters (such as the southern sea otter, &quot;Enhydra lutris&quot;), fish (such as the California sheephead, &quot;Semicossyphus pulcher&quot;) and invertebrates, including crustaceans such as the striped shore crab, &quot;Pachygrapsus crassipes&quot;, and spiny lobsters. Competition for space with other species (such as the sea urchins &quot;Strongylocentrotus purpuratus&quot; and &quot;Strongylocentrotus franciscanus&quot;) is also frequent.

==Human uses==
Humans have harvested black abalone along the California Coast for at least 10,000 years. On San Miguel Island, archaeological evidence shows that the Island Chumash people and their ancestors ate black abalone for millennia and also used the shells to make fishhooks, beads, and ornaments. After the Chumash and other California Indians were devastated by European diseases, and sea otters were nearly eradicated from California waters by the historic fur trade, black abalone populations rebounded and attracted an intensive intertidal fishery conducted primarily by Chinese immigrants from the 1850s to about 1900.

==Conservation status==
Black abalone are listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s Red List as Critically Endangered (CR A4e). On June 23, 1999, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) designated the black abalone as a candidate for protection under the Endangered Species Act (64 FR 33466). On December 21, 2006, the Center for Biological Diversity submitted a petition to NMFS to list the black abalone. On January 11, 2008, NMFS completed their status review of the species and proposed that it be listed as endangered. Black abalone were listed as endangered on January 14, 2009. The NMFS designated critical habitat for the endangered black abalone on October 27, 2011. The state of California has introduced an Abalone Recovery Management Plan to guide conservation efforts.

Black abalone have dramatically declined in numbers throughout their historical range, and are locally extirpated in certain areas. This decline was initiated by overfishing. Following World War II, the California abalone fishery was not managed for individual species. Therefore, it resulted in a systematic depletion of various abalone species as the fishery over-harvested one species and then moved on to the next in an attempt to meet demand. Black abalone were the last to be targeted, with the peak harvest occurring in the 1970s. Additionally, improved harvesting technologies that expanded the harvesting areas and supported larger harvests per unit effort were not initiated. Now, all abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game, which restricts the size of abalone caught, and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico, there is a total allowable catch limit for black abalone. Even though harvesting black abalone is regulated in California, poaching still occurs. Other threats include coastal development for residential areas, harbours and waste discharges, compounded by commercial and recreational fishing of the black abalone.

The depleted stocks of black abalone were further reduced by withering syndrome, first discovered in 1985, when commercial fishermen reported large numbers of empty shells and dying abalone on the shores of several of the Californian Channel Islands (including the islands of Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Rosa, Santa Barbara, San Miguel, and San Clemente). This disease impairs the production of digestive enzymes, effectively starving the abalone to death. Following onset of symptoms, the animal usually quickly dies. In many locations, percentages greater than 90% of individuals have been lost, and in some places, a total loss of the black abalone population occurred. The disease spread from the Channel Islands to the mainland coast in 1992, where it devastated most populations in warmer waters south of Point Conception or in locally warmer waters further north.

<text>Don Edward Baylor (June 28, 1949 – August 7, 2017), nicknamed &quot;Groove,&quot; was an American professional baseball player, coach and manager. During his 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), Baylor was a power hitter known for standing very close to home plate (&quot;crowding the plate&quot;) and was a first baseman, left fielder, and designated hitter. He played for six different American League (AL) teams, primarily the Baltimore Orioles and California Angels, but he also played for the Oakland Athletics, New York Yankees, Minnesota Twins, and Boston Red Sox. In 1979, Baylor was an All-Star and won the AL Most Valuable Player Award. He won three Silver Slugger Awards, the Roberto Clemente Award, and was a member of the 1987 World Series champion Minnesota Twins.

After his playing career, Baylor managed the expansion Colorado Rockies for six years and the Chicago Cubs for three seasons. He was named NL Manager of the Year in 1995, and was inducted into the Angels Hall of Fame.

Baylor reached the World Series three times in his career, in consecutive years with three different teams. Baylor played in the World Series with the Red Sox in 1986, the Twins in 1987, and the A&#x27;s in 1988, and he was on the winning side in 1987. Baylor is one of three players in history to accomplish this feat, along with Eric Hinske and Will Smith. He set the Red Sox team record for most hit by pitches in a season (35 in 1986); in his career, he was hit by pitches 267 times, fourth-most all time. Baylor retired with 285 stolen bases, 2,135 hits, and 338 home runs.

==Early life==
Born in Austin, Texas, on June 28, 1949, Baylor grew up in Clarksville. He graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School. After being one of three African Americans to integrate Texas public schools when he was in junior high school, Baylor starred in baseball and football at Austin High, where he was the first African American to play athletics at that school. Baylor was offered a scholarship to play college football for the Texas Longhorns of the University of Texas, which would have made him the first African American to play football at Texas. He opted to pursue a baseball career, enrolling at Blinn Junior College in Brenham, Texas.

==Professional career==
===Baltimore Orioles===
The Baltimore Orioles selected Baylor in the second round of the 1967 MLB draft. He received a $7,500 signing bonus from the team. In 1970, Baylor led the Triple-A level of the minor leagues with 34 doubles, 15 triples, 127 runs, and 140 games-played while playing for the Rochester Red Wings. The following year, he again led the Triple-A level in doubles with 31. Baylor was called up to the major leagues by the Orioles on September 18, 1970. He debuted at home against Cleveland, accruing two hits and three runs batted in across five plate appearances, including a walk-off RBI single in the 11th inning. Baylor only played a total of 9 games with the Orioles in the 1970 and 1971 seasons and did not see consistent involvement with the major league roster until 1972. 

In his true rookie season in 1972, Baylor posted a .253 batting average, .416 slugging percentage, 11 home runs, and 38 runs batted in across 102 games. Baylor quickly became a respected hitter for the Orioles, averaging .280 at the plate, a .437 slugging percentage, 46 home runs, and 186 runs batted in between 1973 and 1975. He developed a reputation for getting hit by pitches, frequently leaning into off-target pitches and crowding the plate to get on first base without having to get a hit or work a base on balls. In 1973, Baylor led the American League in hit-by-pitches with 13 and he led the major leagues in 1975 with 13.

===Oakland Athletics===
In a transaction influenced by his imminent free agency after the upcoming season, the Orioles traded Baylor with Mike Torrez and Paul Mitchell to the Oakland Athletics for Reggie Jackson, Ken Holtzman and minor-league right-handed pitcher Bill Van Bommel on April 2, 1976. In 1976, Baylor posted a .247 batting average and .368 slugging percentage with 15 home runs and 68 runs batted in. He once again led the major leagues in hit-by-pitches with 20.

===California Angels===
In 1977, Baylor signed with the California Angels as a free agent, joining his former Baltimore teammate Bobby Grich in Anaheim. In 1978, his second season with the Angels, Baylor posted a .255 batting average, .472 slugging percentage, 34 home runs, 99 runs batted in, 22 stolen bases, and a league-leading 18 hit-by-pitches. He placed seventh in AL MVP voting that season. In 1979, Baylor led the majors with 139 runs batted in and 120 runs. He was an AL All-Star, the lone selection of his career. He won the AL&#x27;s MVP award, gaining 20 of 28 first-place votes and led the Angels to their first-ever AL West Division title. Following his MVP season, Baylor&#x27;s stats regressed. In 1980, he played only 90 games due to a wrist injury. In those games, he posted a modest .250 batting average and .341 slugging percentage with 5 home runs, the lowest in any of his career seasons with double-digit games played. Baylor again missed time due to an injury in the 1981 season, playing only 103 games with an again-regressed batting average of .239 but an improved slugging percentage of .427 with 17 home runs and 66 runs batted in. Upon the arrival of superstar free agent Reggie Jackson in the 1982 offseason, Baylor took him in as a roommate. 

In his autobiography titled &quot;Don Baylor: It&#x27;s Nothing But The Truth - A Baseball Life&quot;, Baylor told how his friendship with Jackson was tumultuous at times, particularly some instances where Jackson was highly dismissive of fans who wanted pictures or autographs. Baylor returned to full health in the 1982 season, playing 157 games and looking like his old self by posting a .263 batting average with a .424 slugging percentage accompanied by 24 home runs and 93 runs batted in. After Tommy John allowed three runs through the first three innings of the 1982 American League Championship Series against the Brewers, Baylor came up to John and said, &quot;If you hold them to three runs, I&#x27;m personally good for four runs against [Milwaukee starter Mike] Caldwell.&quot; Baylor delivered on his promise, batting in 5 runs that game as California came back to win 8–3. John later called Baylor the team&#x27;s &quot;catalyst&quot;. Baylor spent six seasons with the Angels and played a plurality of his games with the team. In that time, he batted .262 and slugged .448 with 141 home runs and 523 runs batted in.

===New York Yankees===

In 1983, Baylor signed a four-year, $3.7 million contract with the New York Yankees. Former Angels teammate Tommy John said of Baylor, &quot;When we lost him, we lost our guts. Pitchers feared Don Baylor.&quot; In his autobiography, Baylor told of Yankee alumnus Tommy John and Reggie Jackson warning Baylor not to sign with New York due to team owner George Steinbrenner&#x27;s infamous strict and harsh attitude towards players. Baylor said that he found out for himself that the Yankees would treat free agent targets &quot;like a celebrity&quot; and then treat them like a &quot;piece of trash&quot; once they were on the team. In his autobiography, Baylor notes his rough experience in his first spring training with the Yankees as Steinbrenner would obsess over the exhibition games against the rivaling Mets and Red Sox or New York-televised games. This led to Steinbrenner demoting young players for poor performances in such spring training games. In one instance, Steinbrenner tried to make his team play in a televised game on a field that was made subpar by inclement weather. 

Baylor&#x27;s first season with the Yankees was his statistical best as he batted .303 and slugged .494 with 21 home runs and 85 runs batted in. He was awarded his first career Silver Slugger award for his performance. The following season, Baylor&#x27;s batting percentages dropped but he totaled higher counting stats in fewer games. Baylor had batted .262 and slugged .489 with 27 home runs and 89 runs batted in. Baylor also was less active on the basepaths in 1984, stealing only one base compared to his 17 in the previous season. In the third year of his stint with the Yankees, Baylor&#x27;s percentages continued to decline, this time posting a .231 average and .430 slugging percentage. He earned his second career Silver Slugger that year. In his 3 seasons with the Yankees, Baylor batted .267, hit 71 home runs, and batted in 265 runs.
===Boston Red Sox===

Following the 1985 season, Baylor was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Mike Easler in 1986. It was the first time the Yankees and Red Sox had traded with each other in 14 years. In the 1986 season, Baylor batted .238 with a .439 slugging percentage, 31 home runs, and 94 runs batted in. He was awarded the third Silver Slugger of his career and placed 13th in AL MVP voting.

While a member of the Red Sox, Baylor delivered a key hit in the 1986 American League Championship Series when he hit a two-run home run with one out in the top of the ninth inning during game five against the California Angels. At the time, the Angels led the series three games to one and were one out away from their first ALCS victory. The Red Sox went on to win the game and eventually the ALCS, denying the Angels their first trip to the World Series. Al Michaels, broadcasting the game for ABC, called it the greatest baseball game he had ever seen. However, the Red Sox would fall in the 1986 World Series to the New York Mets in seven games. Baylor played most of the 1987 season with Boston. In 108 games with the Red Sox that year, he batted .239, slugged .404, hit 16 home runs, and batted in 57 runs.

===Minnesota Twins===
Late in the 1987 season, the Red Sox traded Baylor to the Minnesota Twins for a player to be named later that ended up being Enrique Rios. He played 20 regular-season games with the Twins and made the postseason roster that year. Baylor aided the Twins in the winning of their 1987 championship by accruing 5 hits, 3 runs, 1 home run, and 3 runs batted in during the World Series.

===Oakland Athletics (second stint)===
Baylor returned to the Oakland Athletics in 1988, his final season as a player. The 39-year old Baylor batted a career-low .220 and slugged .326 with 7 home runs and 34 runs batted in through 92 games. Baylor was on the playoff roster for the American League champion Athletics that season. Following the season, he retired as a player from baseball.

==Coaching and managerial career==

After retiring as a player, Baylor served as a hitting coach for the Milwaukee Brewers and St. Louis Cardinals until he was named the first manager of the expansion Colorado Rockies. He led the team for six years from 1993 to 1998. The Rockies posted their first winning record (77–67) in 1995 and made the postseason as the wildcard team. As a result, Baylor won the National League Manager of the Year Award.

After the 1998 season, Baylor was fired. He finished his Rockies managerial career with a regular season record of 440–469 and a post–season record of 1–3. He became the hitting coach for the Atlanta Braves in 1999 and was hired to manage the Chicago Cubs in 2000, a job he held through the 2002 season. He had a record of 187–220 with the Cubs. From 2003 to 2004, he served as the bench coach for the New York Mets. He spent the 2005 season with the Seattle Mariners as hitting coach under manager Mike Hargrove and was as a fill-in analyst for MASN in 2007 for Washington Nationals broadcasts.

Baylor served as hitting coach for the Colorado Rockies during the 2009 and 2010 seasons. Baylor was replaced by Carney Lansford after the Rockies hit a franchise-low .226 on the road during the 2010 season. Baylor was offered a special assistant position to remain with Colorado but turned it down.

Baylor agreed on a two-year contract to become hitting coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks for the 2011 and 2012 seasons. He was hired by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim as their hitting coach for the 2014 season. On March 31, 2014, Baylor suffered a fracture to his right femur while catching the ceremonial first pitch of the 2014 season, thrown by Vladimir Guerrero. On April 1, 2014, he had surgery to have a plate and screws inserted into his leg. On October 13, 2015, the Angels announced that Baylor would not return as the team hitting coach in 2016.

==Death==
Baylor was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2003. He died on August 7, 2017, at the age of 68.

<text>Say Anything... is a 1989 American teen romantic comedy drama film written and directed by Cameron Crowe (in his feature directorial debut). The film follows the romance between Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack), an average student, and Diane Court (Ione Skye), the class valedictorian, immediately after their graduation from high school.

&quot;Say Anything...&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on April 14, 1989, by 20th Century Fox. The film received highly positive reviews from critics. In 2002, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Say Anything...&quot; as the greatest modern movie romance, and it was ranked number 11 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; list of the 50 best high school movies.

==Plot==
At the end of their senior year of high school, noble underachiever Lloyd Dobler falls for valedictorian Diane Court and plans to ask her out, though they belong to different social groups.

Lloyd&#x27;s parents are stationed in Germany in the U.S. Army, so he lives with his sister Constance, a single mother, and has no plans yet for his future. Diane comes from a sheltered academic upbringing, living with her doting divorced father Jim, who owns the retirement home where she works. She will take up a prestigious fellowship in England at the end of the summer.

Lloyd offers to take Diane to their graduation party. She agrees, to everyone&#x27;s surprise. Their next &quot;date&quot; is a dinner at Diane&#x27;s, where Lloyd fails to impress Jim, and the Internal Revenue Service informs the latter he is under scrutiny.

Diane introduces Lloyd to the retirement home residents and he teaches her to drive her manual transmission Ford Tempo graduation gift. They grow closer and become intimate, to her father&#x27;s concern. Lloyd&#x27;s musician best friend Corey, who has never gotten over her cheating ex-boyfriend, Joe, warns him to take care of Diane.

Jim urges Diane to break up with Lloyd, feeling he is not an appropriate match, and suggests she give him a pen as a parting gift. Worried about her father, Diane tells Lloyd she wants to stop seeing him and concentrate on her studies, giving him the pen. Devastated, he seeks advice from Corey, who tells him to &quot;be a man&quot;. Meanwhile, Jim discovers his credit cards are declined as the investigation drags on.

On a boombox at dawn, Lloyd stands under her open bedroom window and plays &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; by Peter Gabriel, which played when they became intimate. The next day, Diane meets with the IRS investigator, who says they have evidence incriminating Jim with embezzling funds from his retirement home residents. He suggests she accept the fellowship as matters with her father will worsen.

Diane finds the cash concealed at home and confronts Jim, who tells her he took it to give her financial independence. Jim feels justified in doing so as he provided better care of his residents than their families. Distraught, she reconciles with Lloyd at his kickboxing gym.

At the end of the summer, Jim is incarcerated on a nine-month sentence. Lloyd visits him at the prison, saying he is going with Diane to England; Jim reacts with anger. Lloyd gives him a letter from her, but she arrives to say goodbye and they embrace. Diane gives him the pen she had given Lloyd, asking him to write to her in England. Lloyd supports and comforts Diane, who is afraid of flying, on their flight.

The Smithereens originally wrote &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; for the movie, but the film&#x27;s producers ultimately cut the song believing it revealed too much of the plot, and used &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; by Peter Gabriel in its place; &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; was released later that year on their album &quot;11&quot; and became a top 40 hit in the US. AllMusic wrote that the soundtrack, like the film, is &quot;much smarter than the standard teen fare of the era.&quot; The soundtrack consists of these songs:

==Critical reception==
&quot;Say Anything...&quot; was well reviewed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;One of the definitive Generation X movies, &quot;Say Anything&quot; is equally funny and heartfelt—and it established John Cusack as an icon for left-of-center types everywhere.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 86 based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F.

Giving the film four stars out of four, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert called &quot;Say Anything...&quot; &quot;one of the best films of the year—a film that is really about something, that cares deeply about the issues it contains—and yet it also works wonderfully as a funny, warmhearted romantic comedy.&quot; He later included it in his 2002 Great Movie list, writing, &quot;&quot;Say Anything&quot; exists entirely in a real world, is not a fantasy or a pious parable, has characters who we sort of recognize, and is directed with care for the human feelings involved.&quot;

Pauline Kael in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was similarly enthusiastic, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s a slight movie, but that&#x27;s not a put-down. Its slightness has to do with the writer-director Cameron Crowe&#x27;s specialty: he&#x27;s wired into teen-age flakes and the sloppy, exuberant confusion of high-school dating. Crowe is great here on oddity and fringe moments; the comedy helps to dry out the romanticism -- to give it lightness and a trace of enchantment.&quot;

In a less positive review, &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;half-baked love story, full of good intentions but uneven in the telling.&quot; But, the review also said the film&#x27;s &quot;[a]ppealing tale of an undirected army brat proving himself worthy of the most exceptional girl in high school elicits a few laughs, plenty of smiles and some genuine feeling.&quot; In a mixed review, Caryn James of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:
[The film] resembles a first-rate production of a children&#x27;s story. Its sense of parents and the summer after high school is myopic, presented totally from the teenagers&#x27; point of view. Yet its melodrama—Will Dad go to prison? Will Diane go to England?—distorts that perspective, so the film doesn&#x27;t have much to offer an actual adult, not even a sense of what it&#x27;s truly like to be just out of high school these days. The film is all charming performances and grace notes, but there are plenty of worse things to be.

==Cultural influence==
The film features one of the most enduring scenes in romance films, in which John Cusack holds a boombox above his head outside Diane&#x27;s bedroom window to let her know that he has not given up on her. Crowe and producer James L. Brooks believed the scene could become a hallmark of the movie, though Crowe found it difficult to film because Cusack felt it was &quot;too passive&quot;. The scene was first scored with Fishbone&#x27;s &quot;Question of Life&quot;, but after viewing the scene, Crowe opted to replace it with Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; to better fit the mood that he wished to convey. Gabriel initially turned down Crowe because he confused the film with another film in production at the time, a John Belushi biography called &quot;Wired&quot;. &quot;That scene is like Romeo under the trellis,&quot; said Crowe reminiscing about the iconic scene. &quot;But I have this feeling when I watch it that it&#x27;s filled with double emotion – both with the story and the actors, whose own trepidation bleeds in.&quot;

In a September 2012 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, discussing the 25th anniversary of &quot;So&quot; (from which &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; hails), Gabriel commented on the cultural impact of the scene, &quot;It definitely gave [the song] a second life, because now it&#x27;s so often parodied in comedy shows and it is one of the modern day &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; balcony clichés. I&#x27;ve talked to John Cusack about that. We&#x27;re sort of trapped together in a minuscule moment of contemporary culture.&quot; In October 2012, as Gabriel played the first few bars of the song during a performance at the Hollywood Bowl, Cusack walked onto the stage, handed him a boombox and took a bow, before quickly walking off again. Cameron Crowe was also present at the concert and later tweeted &quot;Peter Gabriel and John Cusack on stage together at the Hollywood Bowl tonight. Won&#x27;t forget that... ever.&quot; At a concert in Madison Square Garden on September 18, 2023 (touring his album &quot;I/O)&quot;, Gabriel held up an inflatable toy boombox during a performance of &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; reported as &quot;a nod to Lloyd Dobler.&quot;

==Canceled TV series==
A television series based on the movie was planned by NBC and 20th Century Fox, but producers Aaron Kaplan and Justin Adler did not know that Crowe had not approved of the project. When they found out his views, the show was dropped.

Copley Square is a public square in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay neighborhood, bounded by Boylston Street, Clarendon Street, St. James Avenue, and Dartmouth Street. The square is named for painter John Singleton Copley. Prior to 1883 it was known as Art Square due to its many cultural institutions, some of which remain today. 

==Architecture==
Several architectural landmarks are adjacent to the square:
* Old South Church (1873), by Charles Amos Cummings and Willard T. Sears in the Venetian Gothic Revival style
* Trinity Church (1877, Romanesque Revival), considered H. H. Richardson&#x27;s &quot;tour de force&quot;
* Boston Public Library (1895), by Charles Follen McKim in a revival of Italian Renaissance style, incorporates artworks by John Singer Sargent, Edwin Austin Abbey, Daniel Chester French, and others
* The Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel (1912) by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in the Beaux-Arts style (on the site of the original Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)
* The John Hancock Tower (1976, late Modernist) by Henry N. Cobb, at New England&#x27;s tallest building
* The BosTix Kiosk (1992, Postmodernist), at the corner of Dartmouth and Boylston streets, by Graham Gund with inspiration from Parisian park pavilions

Notable buildings later demolished:
* Peace Jubilee Coliseum (1869, demolished the same year) A temporary wooden structure, seating fifty thousand, was built on St. James Park for the 1869 National Peace Jubilee. Replaced by World&#x27;s Peace Jubilee Coliseum (1872), which was replaced by the Museum of Fine Arts.
* Second Church (1874, sold 1912, demolished by 1914) A Gothic Revival church by N. J. Bradlee.
* Chauncy Hall School (, demolished 1908), a tall-gabled High Victorian brick school building on Boylston St. near Dartmouth Street.
* Museum of Fine Arts (1876, demolished 1910) by John Hubbard Sturgis and Charles Brigham in the Gothic Revival style, was the first purpose-built public art museum in the world.
* S.S. Pierce Building, (1887, demolished 1958) by S. Edwin Tobey, &quot;no masterpiece of architecture, [but] great urban design. A heap of dark Romanesque masonry, it anchored a corner of Copley Square as solidly as a mountain.&quot;
* Hotel Westminster (1897, demolished 1961), Trinity Place, by Henry E. Cregier; now replaced by the northeast corner of the new John Hancock Tower. Razed in 1961 by owner John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company for a parking lot.
* Grundmann Studios (1893, demolished 1917), home of the Boston Art Students Association (later known as the Copley Society), contained artist studios and Copley Hall, a popular venue for exhibitions, lectures and social gatherings.

==Public art==
* Statue of Phillips Brooks, Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1907–1910)
* The Kahlil Gibran Memorial, Kahlil Gibran, nephew and godson of the poet (1977)
* The Tortoise and the Hare, Nancy Schön (1994)
* The Boston Marathon Centennial Monument, Mark Flannery (1994). Additions by Robert Shure and Robert Lamb (1996). 
* Statue of John Singleton Copley, Lewis Cohen (2002)

==Public events==

One of the most popular attractions in Copley Square is the Farmers Market, held Tuesdays and Fridays from May through November. (During the 2023–2024 reconstruction of the park, the market is held in front of the Public Library on Dartmouth.)

Annual events include First Night activities and ice sculpture competition, the Christmas tree lighting, the Boston Book Festival, and, for several years, the Boston Summer Arts Weekend. The park&#x27;s central location also makes it a natural gathering place for protests and vigils.

The water level in the fountain pool can be lowered, turning it into a stage for concerts and theatrical performances.

==History==

A significant number of important Boston educational and cultural institutions were originally located adjacent to (or very near) Copley Square, reflecting 19th-century Boston&#x27;s aspirations for the location as a center of culture and progress.
These included
the Museum of Fine Arts, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard Medical School, the New England Museum of Natural History (today&#x27;s Museum of Science), Trinity Church, the New Old South Church, the Boston Public Library, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Massachusetts Normal Art School (today&#x27;s Massachusetts College of Art and Design), the Horace Mann School for the Deaf, Boston University, Emerson College, and Northeastern University.
By 1876, with the completion of the Museum of Fine Arts, Walter Muir Whitehill noted that &quot;Copley Square which unlike the rest of the Back Bay had never been properly or reasonably laid out, was beginning to stumble into shape&quot;. But the land comprising the current square, bisected diagonally by Huntington Avenue, was still available for commercial development. The city purchased the larger triangle, then known as Art Square, in 1883 and dubbed it Copley Square. The smaller plot, known as Trinity Triangle, was the subject of several lawsuits against the property owner, who planned to put up a six-story apartment building directly in front of Trinity Church. Foundations were laid but further construction was delayed by various injunctions. The city council appropriated funds for purchase of the triangle in 1885. Calls to close off Huntington between Dartmouth and Boylston streets began almost immediately, but that was not accomplished until 1968.
In 1966, a proposal by the Watertown, Massachusetts, landscape design firm Sasaki, Dawson, DeMay was selected from 188 entrants in a national competition sponsored by the city and private development concerns. The design centered on a sunken terraced plaza, intended to separate the pedestrian from the noise and bustle of the surrounding streets, but it also isolated the square from the community. As the architecture critic Robert Campbell noted, &quot;From the day it opened, it didn&#x27;t work&quot;.

In 1983 the Copley Square Centennial Committee, consisting of representatives of business, civic and residential interests, was formed. They announced a new design competition, funded by a grant of $100,000 from the National Endowment for the Arts. The winner, announced in May 1984, was Dean Abbott of the New York firm Clarke &amp; Rapuano. The park was raised to street-level and a lawn and planting beds were added. The fountain, which had rarely functioned as intended, was re-configured. The updated park was dedicated on June 18, 1989, and received mixed reviews.

By 2021 the park, now heavily used, was again in need of redesign; requirements included alleviating stress on existing trees, adding more trees, making the fountain safer, and prioritizing ease of maintenance. After a series of public meetings, the final proposal by Sasaki Associates was presented to the city in May 2022. Renovations began on July 20, 2023, and are expected to take sixteen months. Part of the renovated park reopened on New Year’s Day, 2025. The plaza and raised grove are set to reopen in January/February, 2025, with the fountain, lawn, and perimeter sidewalks scheduled for completion after the 2025 Boston Marathon. 

The non-profit membership organization Friends of Copley Square was formed in 1992 as a successor to the Copley Square Centennial Committee. It raises funds for care of the square&#x27;s plantings, fountain, and monuments, and also manages the Copley Square Charitable trust.

The Boston Marathon foot race has finished at Copley Square since 1986. A memorial celebrating the race&#x27;s 100th running in 1996 is located in the park, near the corner of Boylston and Dartmouth streets.
===Unrealized proposals===
* 1874 A surveyor&#x27;s map shows a &quot;Chemical School, Inst. Tech.&quot; (never built) and four house lots on the larger triangle.
* 1894 A circular, sunken garden combining designs by Rotch &amp; Tilden and Walker and Kimball, ringed with trees and marble balustrades, centered on a small fountain.
* 1912 A plan by architect Frank Bourne eliminated the Huntington Avenue crossing and sunk the square 2.5 feet below street level. One version featured an enormous monumental column in the center of the plaza.
* 1914 Landscape architect Arthur Shurtleff envisioned a circle of trees around the Brewer Fountain, which would be moved from Boston Common.
* 1927 A proposal for a State War Memorial, from plans by Guy Lowell, placed a large, cylindrical granite structure in a basin. The inner chamber rose fifty feet to a domed ceiling and the memorial was topped with bronze representation of &quot;Hope&quot;.

* 2012 A juried competition held by SHIFTBoston invited designs for creative illumination. First prize was awarded to the firm Khoury Levit Fong for their conceptual chandelier of LEDs suspended over the square.

===Boston Marathon bombing===

On April 15, 2013, around 2:50 pm (about three hours after the first runners crossed the line) two bombs explodedone near the finish line near the Boston Public Library, the other some seconds later and one block west. Three people were killed and at least 183 injured, at least 14 of whom lost limbs.

==Transportation==
Copley is served by several forms of public transportation:
* Copley Station on the MBTA Green Line
* Several MBTA bus routes; the square is a major transfer point and terminal for several local and express routes
* Logan Express to Logan International Airport
* Nearby Back Bay station for MBTA Orange Line, MBTA Commuter Rail, and Amtrak

Major roads:
* Massachusetts Turnpike
* Boylston Street

<text>Manmohan Singh (; 26 September 1932 – 26 December 2024) was an Indian economist, bureaucrat and politician who served as the prime minister of India from 2004 to 2014. He was the fourth longest-serving prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi. A member of the Indian National Congress, Singh was the first Sikh prime minister of India. He was also the first prime minister since Nehru to be re-appointed after completing a full five-year term.

Born in Gah in what is today Pakistan, Singh&#x27;s family migrated to India during its partition in 1947. After obtaining his doctorate in economics from the University of Oxford, Singh worked for the United Nations during 1966–1969. He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. During the 1970s and 1980s, Singh held several key posts in the Government of India, such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–1976), governor of the Reserve Bank (1982–1985) and head of the Planning Commission (1985–1987). In 1991, under prime minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, Singh was appointed as finance minister. Over the next few years, despite strong opposition, he carried out several structural reforms that liberalised India&#x27;s economy. It enhanced Singh&#x27;s reputation globally as a leading reform-minded economist. Subsequently, Singh was leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Parliament of India) during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of 1998–2004.

In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the prime ministership to Singh. His first ministry executed several key legislations and projects, including the National Rural Health Mission, Unique Identification Authority, Rural Employment Guarantee scheme and Right to Information Act. In 2008, opposition to a historic civil nuclear agreement with the United States nearly caused Singh&#x27;s government to fall after Left Front parties withdrew their support. The 2009 general election saw the UPA return with an increased mandate, with Singh retaining the office of prime minister. In 2009, BRICS was established with India as one of the founding members.

During his tenure, India faced several security threats such as 2006 Mumbai train bombings, 26/11, 2005 Delhi bombings, 2008 Delhi bombings and 2011 Delhi bombing. Singh&#x27;s government faced several corruption protests, including 2011 anti-orruption protest, He opted out from the race for the office of prime minister during the 2014 Indian general election. Singh served as a member of the Rajya Sabha, representing the state of Assam from 1991 to 2019 and Rajasthan from 2019 to 2024.

== Early life and education ==
Singh was born to Gurmukh Singh Kohli and Amrit Kaur on 26 September 1932, in Gah, Punjab, British India, into a family of Punjabi Sikh dried fruit traders of Khatri background. His mother died when he was very young. He was raised by his paternal grandmother Jamna Devi, with whom he was very close.

Singh was initially educated at a local gurdwara, where he began studying Urdu and Punjabi. On 17 April 1937, he was enrolled in the local Government Primary School, where he continued his Urdu-medium education until the age of 10 (Class 4), after which he and his family moved to Peshawar. There, Singh was enrolled in the upper-primary Khalsa School. He sat for his matriculation examination in the summer of 1947. Even as prime minister years later, Singh wrote his apparently Hindi speeches in the Urdu script, although sometimes he would also use Gurmukhi, a script used to write Punjabi, his mother tongue.

After the Partition of India, his family migrated to Haldwani, India. In 1948 they relocated to Amritsar, where he studied at Hindu College, Amritsar. He attended Panjab University, then in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, studying Economics and got his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in 1952 and 1954, respectively, standing first throughout his academic career. He completed his Economics Tripos at University of Cambridge in 1957. He was a member of St John&#x27;s College.

In a 2005 interview with the British journalist Mark Tully, Singh said about his Cambridge days:

After Cambridge, Singh returned to India and served as a teacher at Panjab University. In 1960, he went to the University of Oxford for his DPhil, where he was a member of Nuffield College. His 1962 doctoral thesis under the supervision of Ian Little was titled &quot;India&#x27;s export performance, 1951–1960, export prospects and policy implications&quot;, and was later the basis for his book &quot;India&#x27;s Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth&quot;.

== Early career ==

After completing his D. Phil., Singh returned to India. He was a senior lecturer of economics at Panjab University from 1957 to 1959. During 1959 and 1963, he served as a reader in economics at Panjab University, and from 1963 to 1965, he was an economics professor there. Then he went to work for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) from 1966 to 1969. Later, he was appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Trade by Lalit Narayan Mishra, in recognition of Singh&#x27;s talent as an economist.

From 1969 to 1971, Singh was a professor of international trade at the Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi.

In 1972, Singh was chief economic adviser in the Ministry of Finance, and in 1976 he was secretary in the Finance Ministry. In 1980–1982 he was at the Planning Commission, and in 1982, he was appointed governor of the Reserve Bank of India under then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and held the post until 1985. He went on to become the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission (India) from 1985 to 1987. Following his tenure at the Planning Commission, he was secretary general of the South Commission, an independent economic policy think tank headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland from 1987 to November 1990.

Singh returned to India from Geneva in November 1990 and held the post as the advisor to Prime Minister of India on economic affairs during the tenure of Chandra Shekar. In March 1991, he became chairman of the University Grants Commission.

== Political career ==
In June 1991, India&#x27;s prime minister at the time, P. V. Narasimha Rao, chose Singh to be his finance minister. Singh told Mark Tully, a British journalist, in 2005:

On the day (Rao) was formulating his cabinet, he sent his Principal Secretary to me saying, &quot;The PM would like you to become the Minister of Finance&quot;. I didn&#x27;t take it seriously. He eventually tracked me down the next morning, rather angry, and demanded that I get dressed up and come to Rashtrapati Bhavan for the swearing in. So that&#x27;s how I started in politics[.] 

=== Minister of Finance (1991–1996) ===
In 1991, India&#x27;s fiscal deficit was close to 8.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, the balance of payments deficit was huge and the current account deficit was close to 3.5 per cent of India&#x27;s GDP. India&#x27;s foreign reserves barely amounted to US$1billion, enough to pay for 2 weeks of imports, in comparison to US$600 billion in 2009.

Singh explained to the PM and the party that India is facing an unprecedented crisis. However the rank and file of the party resisted deregulation. So P. Chidambaram and Singh explained to the party that the economy would collapse if it was not deregulated. To the dismay of the party, Rao allowed Singh to deregulate the Indian economy.

Subsequently, Singh, who had thus far been one of the most influential architects of India&#x27;s socialist economy, eliminated the permit raj, reduced state control of the economy, and reduced import taxes Rao and Singh thus implemented policies to open up the economy and change India&#x27;s socialist economy to a more capitalistic one, in the process dismantling the License Raj, a system that inhibited the prosperity of private businesses. They removed many obstacles standing in the way of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and initiated the process of the privatisation of public sector companies. However, in spite of these reforms, Rao&#x27;s government was voted out in 1996 due to non-performance of government in other areas. In praise of Singh&#x27;s work that pushed India towards a market economy, long-time Cabinet minister P. Chidambaram has compared Singh&#x27;s role in India&#x27;s reforms to Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s in China.

In 1993, Singh offered his resignation from the post of Finance Minister after a parliamentary investigation report criticised his ministry for not being able to anticipate a US$1.8billion 1992 securities scandal. Prime Minister Rao refused Singh&#x27;s resignation, instead promising to punish the individuals directly accused in the report.

=== Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha (1998–2004) ===
Singh was first elected to the upper house of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, in 1991 by the legislature of the state of Assam, and was re-elected in 1995, 2001, 2007 and 2013. From 1998 to 2004, while the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power, Singh was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. In 1999, he contested for the Lok Sabha from South Delhi but was unable to win the seat.

== Prime Minister (2004–2014) ==
=== First term (2004–2009) ===
After the 2004 general elections, the Indian National Congress ended the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA) tenure by becoming the political party with the single largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha. It formed United Progressive Alliance (UPA) with allies and staked claim to form government. In a surprise move, Chairperson Sonia Gandhi declared Manmohan Singh, a technocrat, as the UPA candidate for the prime ministership. Despite the fact that Singh had never won a direct popular election, according to the BBC, he &quot;enjoyed massive popular support, not least because he was seen by many as a clean politician untouched by the taint of corruption that has run through many Indian administrations.&quot; He took the oath as the Prime Minister of India on 22 May 2004.

==== Economic policy ====
In 1991, Singh, as Finance Minister, abolished the Licence Raj, source of slow economic growth and corruption in the Indian economy for decades. He liberalised the Indian economy, allowing it to speed up development dramatically. During his term as prime minister, Singh continued to encourage growth in the Indian market, enjoying widespread success in these matters. Singh, along with his finance minister, P. Chidambaram, presided over a period where the Indian economy grew with an 8–9% economic growth rate. In 2007, India achieved its highest GDP growth rate of 9% and became the second fastest growing major economy in the world. Singh&#x27;s ministry enacted a National Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2005.

Singh&#x27;s government continued the Golden Quadrilateral and the highway modernisation program that was initiated by Vajpayee&#x27;s government. Singh also worked on reforming the banking and financial sectors, as well as public sector companies. The Finance ministry worked towards relieving farmers of their debt and worked towards pro-industry policies. In 2005, Singh&#x27;s government introduced the value added tax, replacing sales tax. In 2007 and early 2008, the global problem of inflation impacted India.

==== Healthcare and education ====
In 2005, Prime Minister Singh and his government&#x27;s health ministry started the National Rural Health Mission (NHRM), which mobilised half a million community health workers. This rural health initiative was praised by the American economist Jeffrey Sachs. In 2006, his Government implemented the proposal to reserve 27% of seats in All India Institute of Medical Studies (AIIMS), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other central institutions of higher education for Other Backward Classes which led to 2006 Indian anti-reservation protests.

On 2 July 2009, Singh ministry introduced the Right to Education Act (RTE) act. Eight IITs were opened in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Orissa, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh. The Singh government also continued the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan program. The program includes the introduction and improvement of mid-day meals and the opening of schools all over India, especially in rural areas, to fight illiteracy.

==== Home affairs ====

Singh&#x27;s government strengthened anti-terror laws with amendments to Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). National Investigation Agency (NIA) was also created soon after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, as need for a central agency to combat terrorism was realised. Also, Unique Identification Authority of India was established in February 2009, an agency responsible for implementing the envisioned Multipurpose National Identity Card with the objective of increasing national security and facilitating e-governance.

Singh&#x27;s administration initiated a massive reconstruction effort in Kashmir to stabilise the region but after some period of success, insurgent infiltration and terrorism in Kashmir has increased since 2009. The Singh administration was, however, successful in reducing terrorism in Northeast India.

In 2005, he controversially apologised on behalf of the Indian National Congress for the bloodshed during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in a speech to Parliament.

==== Notable legislation ====
The important National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the Right to Information Act were passed by the Parliament in 2005 during his tenure. While the effectiveness of the NREGA has been successful at various degrees, in various regions, the RTI act has proved crucial in India&#x27;s fight against corruption. New cash benefits were also introduced for widows, pregnant women, and landless persons.

The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 was passed on 29 August 2013 in the Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian parliament) and on 4 September 2013 in Rajya Sabha (upper house of the Indian parliament). The bill received the assent of the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee on 27 September 2013. The Act came into force from 1 January 2014.

Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act was enacted on 4 August 2009, which describes the modalities of the importance of free and compulsory education for children between 6 and 14 in India under Article 21A of the Indian Constitution. India became one of 135 countries to make education a fundamental right of every child when the act came into force on 1 April 2010.

==== Foreign policy ====

Manmohan Singh continued the pragmatic foreign policy that was started by P.V. Narasimha Rao and continued by Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Singh continued the peace process with Pakistan initiated by his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Exchange of high-level visits by top leaders from both countries have highlighted his tenure. Efforts have been made during Singh&#x27;s tenure to end the border dispute with People&#x27;s Republic of China. In November 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao visited India which was followed by Singh&#x27;s visit to Beijing in January 2008. A major development in Sino-Indian relations was the reopening of the Nathula Pass in 2006 after being closed for more than four decades. Premier of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Li Keqiang paid a state visit to India (Delhi-Mumbai) from 19 to 21 May 2013. Singh paid an official visit to China from 22 to 24 October 2013. Three agreements were signed establishing sister-city partnership between Delhi-Beijing, Kolkata-Kunming and Bangalore-Chengdu. As of 2010, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was the second biggest trade partner of India.

Relations with Afghanistan have improved considerably, with India now becoming the largest regional donor to Afghanistan. During Afghan President Hamid Karzai&#x27;s visit to New Delhi in August 2008, Manmohan Singh increased the aid package to Afghanistan for the development of more schools, health clinics, infrastructure, and defence. Under the leadership of Singh, India emerged as one of the single largest aid donors to Afghanistan.


Singh&#x27;s government worked towards stronger ties with the United States. He visited the United States in July 2005 initiating negotiations over the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement. This was followed by George W. Bush&#x27;s successful visit to India in March 2006, during which the declaration over the nuclear agreement was made, giving India access to American nuclear fuel and technology while India will have to allow IAEA inspection of its civil nuclear reactors. After more than two years for more negotiations, followed by approval from the IAEA, Nuclear Suppliers Group and the US Congress, India and the US signed the agreement on 10 October 2008 with Pranab Mukherjee representing India. Singh had the first official state visit to the White House during the administration of US President Barack Obama. The visit took place in November 2009, and several discussions took place, including on trade and nuclear power.

Relations improved with Japan and European Union countries, like the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Relations with Iran continued and negotiations over the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline have taken place. New Delhi hosted an India–Africa Summit in April 2006 which was attended by the leaders of 15 African states. Relations have improved with other developing countries, particularly Brazil and South Africa. Singh carried forward the momentum which was established after the &quot;Brasilia Declaration&quot; in 2003 and the IBSA Dialogue Forum was formed.

Singh&#x27;s government has also been especially keen on expanding ties with Israel. Since 2003, the two countries have made significant investments in each other and Israel now rivals Russia to become India&#x27;s largest defence partner. Though there have been a few diplomatic glitches between India and Russia, especially over the delay and price hike of several Russian weapons to be delivered to India, relations between the two remained strong with India and Russia signing various agreements to increase defence, nuclear energy and space co-operation.

During the Libyan Civil War, India abstained from voting on the UN Security Council&#x27;s Resolutions 1970 and 1973 that authorised NATO action in Libya. In Lok Sabha, resolution was uniamously adopted to condemn NATO&#x27;s military intervention in Libya.

In 2009, Singh was among the leaders who laid the foundation of the BRICS. The establishment of the group is often described as a display of emergent economic power.

Singh criticised the West for the use of force to enforce regime change in Syria and Libya during his speech at the UN in September 2011. India was silent over the killing of Gaddafi. Although India was among the last few countries to recognise the Libyan National Transitional Council, it agreed to work with the Council to help rebuild Libya. India resent an ambassador to Tripoli in July 2012 having shut its mission in Tripoli in 2011.

=== Second term (2009–2014) ===
India held general elections to the 15th Lok Sabha in five phases between 16 April 2009 and 13 May 2009. The results of the election were announced on 16 May 2009. Strong showing in Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh helped the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) form the new government under the incumbent Singh, who became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962 to win re-election after completing a full five-year term. The Congress and its allies were able to put together a comfortable majority with support from 322 members out of 543 members of the House. These included those of the UPA and the external support from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(S)), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and other minor parties.

On 22 May 2009, Manmohan Singh was sworn in as the prime minister during a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

In his second term, Singh&#x27;s government was involved in political scandals such as the 2G spectrum case and the Commonwealth Games scandal. Singh declined to appear before a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in April 2013 when called upon by one of the members of JPC Yashwant Sinha for his alleged involvement in the 2G case. In 2017, all of the accused were acquitted in the 2G case. Following this verdict, the Congress stated the &quot;BJP has been exposed for its untruth and propaganda against Congress,&quot; and urged Narendra Modi and Arun Jaitley &quot;to apologise to the nation&quot;.

Following the 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder, Singh appealed for calm, stressing that &quot;violence will serve no purpose&quot;. In a televised address, he assured that all possible efforts would be made to ensure the safety of women in India. Singh expressed empathy, saying: &quot;As a father of three daughters I feel as strongly about the incident as each one of you&quot;. As a tribute to the victim, the prime minister cancelled all his official events to celebrate the new year.

The 2012 report filed by the CAG in Parliament of India states that due to the allocation of coal blocks to certain private companies without bidding process the nation suffered an estimated loss of Rs 1.85trillion (short scale) between 2005 and 2009 in which Manmohan Singh was the coal minister of India.

Singh&#x27;s government had an approval rating of 30% by 2013.

== Post-premiership (2014–2024) ==
Singh&#x27;s premiership officially ended at noon on 17 May 2014. He did not contest the 2014 general election for the 16th Lok Sabha as the prime ministerial candidate. He resigned his post as prime minister after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance won the election. He served as the acting prime minister till 26 May 2014, when Narendra Modi was sworn in as the new prime minister. Singh, along with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former Presidents A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and Pratibha Patil, and Vice-President Hamid Ansari attended Modi&#x27;s swearing-in ceremony.

In 2016, it was announced that Singh was to take up a position at Panjab University as the Jawaharlal Nehru Chair, which he eventually did not. He was elected as the Rajya Sabha MP for Rajasthan in 2019, succeeding BJP MP Madan Lal Saini. Singh retired from the Rajya Sabha in April 2024 and was succeeded by Sonia Gandhi.

== Public image and legacy ==
&quot;The Independent&quot; described Singh as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most revered leaders&quot; and &quot;a man of uncommon decency and grace&quot;, noting that he drives a Maruti 800, one of the humblest cars in the Indian market. Khushwant Singh lauded Singh as the best prime minister India has had, even rating him higher than Jawaharlal Nehru. He mentions an incident in his book &quot;Absolute Khushwant: The Low-Down on Life, Death and Most things In-between&quot; where after losing the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, Singh immediately returned the he had borrowed from the writer for hiring taxis. Terming him as the best example of integrity, Khushwant Singh stated, &quot;When people talk of integrity, I say the best example is the man who occupies the country&#x27;s highest office.&quot;

In 2010, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine recognised him as a world leader who is respected by other heads of state, describing him as &quot;the leader other leaders love.&quot; The article quoted Mohamed ElBaradei, who remarked that Singh is &quot;the model of what a political leader should be.&quot; Singh also received the World Statesman Award in 2010. Henry Kissinger described Singh as &quot;a statesman with vision, persistence and integrity&quot;, and praised him for his &quot;leadership, which has been instrumental in the economic transformation underway in India.&quot;

Singh was ranked 18 on the 2010 Forbes list of the World&#x27;s Most Powerful People. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine described Singh as being &quot;universally praised as India&#x27;s best prime minister since Nehru&quot;. Australian journalist Greg Sheridan praised Singh &quot;as one of the greatest statesmen in Asian history.&quot; Singh was later ranked 19 and 28 in 2012 and 2013 in the Forbes list. &quot;Time&quot; magazine described Singh as &quot;guiding India into the ranks of the great powers&quot;.

Conversely, &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Asia edition for 10–17 July 2012, on its cover remarked that Singh was an &quot;underachiever&quot;. It stated that Singh appears &quot;unwilling to stick his neck out&quot; on reforms that will put the country back onto a growth path. Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari rebutted the charges. UPA ally Lalu Prasad Yadav took issue with the magazine&#x27;s statements. Praising the government, Prasad said UPA projects [were] doing well and asked, &quot;What will America say as their own economy is shattered?&quot;. Additionally, Singh faced negative reception following the 2008 Mumbai attacks for falling short on enhancing national security.

In his 2020 memoir &quot;A Promised Land&quot;, former U.S. President Barack Obama called Singh &quot;Wise, thoughtful, and scrupulously honest&quot;.

Political opponents, including BJP co-founder L. K. Advani, have claimed that Singh is a &quot;weak&quot; prime minister. Advani declared &quot;He is weak. What do I call a person who can&#x27;t take his decisions until 10 Janpath gives instruction.&quot; Arvind Kejriwal in 2018 said the people are &quot;missing an educated PM like Dr Manmohan Singh&quot;. In 2022, Union Transport Minister of Modi Government, Nitin Gadkari said the &quot;country is indebted to Manmohan Singh for the liberalisation that gave a new direction&quot;.

In 2013, BJP leader Narendra Modi had termed Singh as &quot;night watchman&quot; and a &quot;puppet of the Gandhi family&quot;. On 8 February 2024, Modi praised Manmohan Singh stating,

Ideological differences are short lived, but the way Manmohan Singh has guided this House and the country for such a long period, he will be remembered for his contributions during every discussion on our democracy.

Modi also recalled when Singh arrived at the Parliament in a wheelchair to cast his vote over a key legislation.

Following his death, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Singh one of &quot;India&#x27;s most distinguished leaders&quot; and declared national mourning. President Droupadi Murmu, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi, Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and former Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda issued statements praising Singh and his leadership after his death.Mauritius and Bhutan flew their flags at half-mast to mourn the death of Singh.

<text>In archaeology a section is a view in part of the archaeological sequence showing it in the vertical plane, as a cross section, and thereby illustrating its profile and stratigraphy. This may make it easier to view and interpret as it developed over time.
==Sections==
Half-sectioning is the usual method whereby one half of a feature is excavated and the remainder left in situ. Large linear features may be sectioned at intervals along their lengths. Sectioning has fallen out of favour in some schools of practice because detail is often missed in section that is important to the phasing of the site. Examples of detail that is revealed poorly &quot;in section&quot; include gravel or thin cobbled surfaces. The main problem with sections is that the arbitrary location of their placement may &quot;clip&quot; or &quot;just miss&quot; contexts that reveal a different story from the one interpreted by the archaeologist. For instance thin liner features such as wheel ruts may be sectioned at an oblique angle giving the impression of a wider feature as the eye and brain tends to assume that features revealed in section have been cut at right angles to the orientation the feature was made. Numerous other false readings of sections are possible to the unwary, this is why excavation &quot;in plan&quot; is now preferred. Sections are used in conjunction with two-dimensional excavation by plan to determine the origin of archaeological remains. For recording purposes sections are normally drawn at a scale of 1:10 or 1:20 with their height related to the site benchmark which in turn is related back to a level fixed at some agreed standard of sea level. Orientation should also be recorded. If the section is instructive a photographic record may also be made.

==Stratigraphic control==
Sections may also be employed in excavation in temporary fashion as a form of stratigraphic control so as to ascertain the relationship between two or more contexts which may be better examined by the use of a section. Then once a relationship is established contexts can be removed from site in the reverse order they arrived in accordance with the stratigraphic excavation and the creation of a Harris matrix for the sequence being investigated. It is up to the archaeologist on site to determine the best local on site strategy for excavating deposits, be it &quot;in section&quot; or &quot;in plan&quot;. In this regard the modern archaeologist uses sectioning as a tool for understanding the site stratigraphically during excavation rather than as an end goal in recording it. These caveats aside sections remain a powerful tool for archaeological investigation. A revival of digging in section with machines has occurred in recent years by a proliferation of limited time constrained development led excavations.

==Quarter sectioning==

Sometimes called digging by quadrant this special case is a procedure for excavating circular features, usually mounds and barrows. Deposits are excavated from four quarters of the feature, starting with two diagonally opposite quadrants and perhaps ending with the other two. The quadrants are slightly offset, so that the outer balk of one is continuous (in reverse) with the outer face of its opposite, going through the center of the feature. After the recording of the sections, the balks may be removed and the rest of the feature excavated. The advantage of quarter sectioning is it allows a look at two complete cross-sections while still allowing excavation in plan thus allowing a better interpretation of the stratigraphy of the site. The merits of this sectioning and balk creation are disputed.

<text>7 Television Commercials is a collection of music videos by the English rock band Radiohead, covering the period from &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995) to &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997).

==Release==
The VHS home video was released on 4 May 1998 in the United Kingdom, and on 30 June in the United States. The DVD was released on 4 August 2003 in the UK and 5 August in North America.

==Music videos==

#&quot;Paranoid Android&quot;
#&quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot;
#&quot;No Surprises&quot;
#&quot;Just&quot;
#&quot;High and Dry&quot; (U.S. version)
#&quot;Karma Police&quot;
#&quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;7 Television Commercials&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Reviewer Ian Reed felt that &quot;it could have been better&quot;. Reed also commented on the duration of the video, just over 30 minutes, only seven music videos.

Christian Hoard of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the re-release collection of videos 2 out of 4 stars, also mentioning the length of the release: &quot;Why only seven? And no bonus material? You&#x27;d think that a band as wary of commercial exploitation as Radiohead wouldn&#x27;t ask fans to shell out for so slight a souvenir.&quot;

All videos commissioned by Dilly Gent.

Packaging art and design by Stanley Donwood and The White Chocolate Farm.

<doc id="606507" wikidata="Q76988" url="?curid=606507" title="Mayer Amschel Rothschild">
<text>Mayer Amschel Rothschild (23 February 1744 – 19 September 1812; also spelled &quot;Anschel&quot;) was a German-Jewish banker and the founder of the Rothschild banking dynasty. Referred to as a &quot;founding father of international finance&quot;, Rothschild was ranked seventh on the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine list of &quot;The Twenty Most Influential Businessmen of All Time&quot; in 2005.

==Early life==
Mayer Amschel Rothschild was born in 1744 to an Ashkenazi Jewish family, in the &quot;Judengasse&quot;, the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt, Holy Roman Empire (now Germany), one of eight children of Amschel Moses Rothschild (d. 1755) and his wife, Schönche Rothschild (née Lechnich; d. 1756).

The ancestry of the Rothschilds is originated back to 1569 to Izaak Elchanan Rothschild (Isaac (Isaak) Elchanan Bacharach, zum Hahn), whose name is derived from the German &quot;zum rothen Schild&quot; (with the old spelling &quot;th&quot;), meaning &quot;with the red shield&quot;, in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations (At the time, houses were designated by signs with different symbols or colors, not numbers). His grandchildren and descendants took this name as the family name and kept it when they relocated in 1664 to another house in the Judengasse—&quot;&quot; (&quot;[house in] the back of the saucepan&quot;) — which became the family&#x27;s home and place of business through to the early 19th century.

Amschel&#x27;s father had a business in goods-trading and currency exchange. He was a personal supplier of coins to the Prince of Hesse. The family home above the shop had a front wall wide, where more than 30 people lived at that time.

==Business career==

With the help of relatives, Rothschild secured an apprenticeship under Jacob Wolf Oppenheimer at the banking firm of Simon Wolf Oppenheimer in Hanover in 1757. The grandson of Samuel Oppenheimer taught Rothschild useful knowledge in foreign trade and currency exchange, before he returned to his brothers&#x27; business in Frankfurt in 1763. 

He became a dealer in rare coins and won the patronage of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Hesse (who had also earlier patronised his father), gaining the title of &quot;Court Factor&quot; in 1769. Rothschild&#x27;s coin business grew to include a number of princely patrons, and then expanded through the provision of banking services to Crown Prince Wilhelm, who became Wilhelm IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel in 1785. Business expanded rapidly following the French Revolution when Rothschild handled payments from Britain for the hire of Hessian mercenaries.

By the early years of the 19th century, Rothschild had consolidated his position as principal international banker to Wilhelm IX and began to issue his own international loans, borrowing capital from the Landgrave.

In 1806, Napoleon invaded Hesse in response to Wilhelm&#x27;s support for Prussia. The Landgrave went into exile in the Duchy of Holstein, but Rothschild was able to continue as his banker, investing funds in London. He also profited from importing goods in circumvention of Napoleon&#x27;s continental blockade.

==Rothschild dynasty==
In 1798, third-born son Nathan Mayer Rothschild was sent to England to further the family interests in textile importing with £20,000 capital (equivalent of £ million in 2024)—the first foreign branch. Nathan became a naturalized citizen in 1804 and established a bank in the City of London. In 1810, Mayer entered into a formal partnership agreement with his three eldest sons, thus founding M. A. Rothschild &amp; Söhne.

In 1811, the Grand Duke of Frankfurt enacted a special law &quot;decreeing that all Jews living in Frankfurt, together with their descendants, should enjoy civil rights and privileges equally with other citizens.&quot; In exchange for these newfound liberties the Jews had to pay him 440,000 florins, financed by Mayer Amschel Rothschild (at a substantial profit). A number of Masonic Jews at the time also petitioned the Grand Duke for the &quot;exclusive right to maintain lodges in the city&quot;, which was granted.

The youngest son of Mayer Amschel, Jacob, was sent to Paris the same year, in 1811, enhancing the family&#x27;s ability to operate across Europe. This enabled them to profit from the opportunity of financing Wellington&#x27;s armies in Portugal, requiring the sourcing of large quantities of gold on behalf of the British government.

Rothschild died on 19 September 1812 in Frankfurt am Main. He was buried at the old Jewish cemetery in Frankfurt, located next to the Judengasse. His grave still exists. A park was named after him, and also a street (Rothschildallee). In 1817, he was posthumously ennobled by the emperor Francis I of Austria. 

His descendants furthered the family fortune across Europe—the &quot;five arrows&quot; of banking. Eldest son Amschel Mayer took over the Frankfurt bank and Salomon moved to Vienna. Nathan turned the London branch into one of Europe&#x27;s most powerful banking institutions (N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons), Calmann (gentrified to &quot;Carl&quot;) set up a branch in Naples and Jacob (&quot;James&quot;) opened de Rothschild Frères, becoming a giant of finance in Paris.

<doc id="606522" wikidata="Q730099" url="?curid=606522" title="New institutionalism">
<text>Neo institutionalism (also referred to as neo-institutionalist theory or institutionalism) is an approach to the study of institutions that focuses on the constraining and enabling effects of formal and informal rules on the behavior of individuals and groups. New institutionalism traditionally encompasses three major strands: sociological institutionalism, rational choice institutionalism, and historical institutionalism. New institutionalism originated in work by sociologist John Meyer published in 1977.

==History==
The study of institutions and their interactions has been a focus of academic research for many years. In the late 19th and early 20th century, social theorists began to systematize this body of literature. One of the most prominent examples of this was the work of German economist and social theorist Max Weber; Weber focused on the organizational structure (i.e. bureaucracy) within society, and the institutionalization created by means of the iron cage which organizational bureaucracies create. In Britain and the United States, the study of political institutions dominated political science until the 1950s. This approach, sometimes called &#x27;old&#x27; institutionalism, focused on analyzing the formal institutions of government and the state in comparative perspective. It was followed by a behavioral revolution which brought new perspectives to analyzing politics, such as positivism, rational choice theory, and behavioralism, and the narrow focus on institutions was discarded as the focus moved to analyzing individuals rather than the institutions which surrounded them. New Institutionalism was a reaction to the behavioral revolution.

Institutionalism experienced a significant revival in 1977 with two influential papers by John W. Meyer and Brian Rowan on one hand and Lynn Zucker on the other. The revised formulation of institutionalism proposed in this paper prompted a significant shift in the way institutional analysis was conducted. Research that followed became known as &quot;new&quot; institutionalism, a concept that is generally referred to as &quot;neo-institutionalism&quot; in academic literature. Another significant reformulation occurred with Paul DiMaggio and Walter W. Powell&#x27;s paper on isomorphism. The three papers had in common that they explained the practices of organizations not in terms of efficacy and efficiency, but in terms of legitimacy. The functions of an organization did not necessarily reflect rational or optimal ends, but were instead myths, ceremonies and scripts that had a veneer of rationality.

The following decade saw an explosion of literature on the topic across many disciplines, including those outside of the social sciences. Examples of the body of work in the decade which followed can be found in DiMaggio and Powell&#x27;s 1991 anthology in the field of sociology; in economics, the Nobel Prize-winning work of Douglass North is a noted example.

More-recent work has begun to emphasize multiple competing logics, focusing on the more-heterogeneous sources of diversity within fields and the institutional embeddedness of technical considerations. The concept of logic generally refers to broader cultural beliefs and rules that structure cognition and guide decision-making in a field. At the organization level, logic can focus the attention of key decision-makers on a delimited set of issues and solutions, leading to logic-consistent decisions that reinforce extant organizational identities and strategies. In line with the new institutionalism, social rule system theory stresses that particular institutions and their organizational instantiations are deeply embedded in cultural, social, and political environments and that particular structures and practices are often reflections of as well as responses to rules, laws, conventions, paradigms built into the wider environment.

=== Old institutionalism ===
Kathleen Thelen and Sven Steinmo contrast New Institutionalism with &quot;Old Institutionalism&quot;, which was overwhelmingly focused on detailed narratives of institutions, with little focus on comparative analyses. Thus, the Old Institutionalism was unhelpful for comparative research and explanatory theory. This &quot;Old Institutionalism&quot; began to be undermined when scholars increasingly highlighted how the formal rules and administrative structures of institutions were not accurately describing the behavior of actors and policy outcomes.

=== Definition of institution ===
There is no agreed upon definition of institution in new institutionalist scholarship. Mats Alvesson and Andre Spicer wrote in 2018 that it had become &quot;difficult to agree what an institution is not – because institutions have become everything... When the term institution is defined, it is done so in broad and vague ways.&quot;

==Diversity of scholarship==
Numerous scholarly approaches have been described as being part of New institutionalism.

=== Sociological institutionalism ===

Sociological institutionalism is a form of new institutionalism that concerns &quot;the way in which institutions create meaning for individuals, providing important theoretical building blocks for normative institutionalism within political science&quot;. Some sociological institutionalists argue that institutions have developed to become similar (showing an isomorphism) across organizations even though they evolved in different ways. Institutions are therefore seen as important in cementing and propagating cultural norms. Sociological institutionalists also emphasize how the functions and structures of organizations do not necessarily reflect functional purposes, but rather ceremonies and rituals. Actors comply with institutional rules and norms because other types of behavior are inconceivable; actors follow routines because they take a for-granted quality.

Normative institutionalism is a sociological interpretation of institutions and holds that a &quot;logic of appropriateness&quot; guides the behavior of actors within an institution. It predicts that the norms and formal rules of institutions will shape the actions of those acting within them. According to James March, the logic of appropriateness means that actions are &quot;matched to situations by means of rules organized into identities.&quot; Thus normative institutionalism views that much of the behavior of institutional actors is based on the recognized situation that the actors encounter, the identity of the actors in the situation, and the analysis by the actor of the rules that generally govern behavior for that actor in that particular situation.

=== New institutional economics ===

New institutional economics (NIE) is an economic perspective that attempts to extend economics by focusing on the institutions (that is to say the social and legal norms and rules) that underlie economic activity and with analysis beyond earlier institutional economics and neoclassical economics. It can be seen as a broadening step to include aspects excluded in neoclassical economics. It rediscovers aspects of classical political economy. Major scholars associated with the subject include Masahiko Aoki, Armen Alchian, Harold Demsetz, Steven N. S. Cheung, Avner Greif, Yoram Barzel, Claude Ménard (economist), Daron Acemoglu, and four Nobel laureates—Ronald Coase, Douglass North, Elinor Ostrom, and Oliver Williamson. A convergence of such researchers resulted in founding the Society for Institutional &amp; Organizational Economics (formerly the International Society for New Institutional Economics) in 1997.

=== Rational choice institutionalism ===

Rational choice institutionalism is a theoretical approach to the study of institutions arguing that actors use institutions to maximize their utility. Institutions are understood to be exogenously given constraints (&quot;rules of the game&quot;) on rational individual behavior. It employs analytical tools borrowed from neo-classical economics to explain how institutions are created, the behaviour of political actors within it, and the outcome of strategic interaction. Rational choice institutionalism draws heavily from rational choice theory but is not identical to it. Proponents argue that political actors&#x27; rational choices are constrained (called &quot;bounded rationality&quot;). These bounds are accepted as individuals realize their goals can be best achieved through institutions. In other words, institutions are systems of rules and inducements to behavior in which individuals attempt to maximize their own benefit.

According to Erik Voeten, rational choice scholarship on institutions can be divided between (1) rational functionalism and (2) Distributive rationalism. The former sees organizations as functional optimal solutions to collective problems, whereas the latter sees organizations as an outcome of actors&#x27; individual and collective goals. Since individual and collective goals may conflict, the latter version of RCI accepts that suboptimal institutions are likely.

===Historical institutionalism===

Emphasizes how timing, sequences and path dependence affect institutions, and shape social, political, economic behavior and change. Unlike functionalist theories and some rational choice approaches, historical institutionalism tends to emphasize that many outcomes are possible, small events and flukes can have large consequences, actions are hard to reverse once they take place, and that outcomes may be inefficient. A critical juncture may set in motion events that are hard to reverse, because of issues related to path dependency. Historical institutionalists tend to focus on history (longer temporal horizons) to understand why specific events happen.

===Discursive institutionalism===
Proponents of discursive institutionalism, such as Vivien Schmidt, emphasize how ideas and discourses affect institutional stability and change.

===Constructivist institutionalism===
Constructivist institutionalists assert that political, social, or policy discourses can perform communicative functions: actors publicly expressing ideas can lead to social change, or coordinating functions. Thus ideas and meaning provide a mechanism for multiple actors to achieve consensus on norms and values and thus create social change. This is increasingly moving beyond political science and into international relations theory and foreign policy analysis.

===Feminist institutionalism===
Feminist institutionalism is a new institutionalist approach which looks at &quot;how gender norms operate within institutions and how institutional processes construct and maintain gender power dynamics&quot;.

<doc id="606531" wikidata="Q1030639" url="?curid=606531" title="Geoff Bodine">
<text>Geoffrey Eli Bodine (born April 18, 1949) is an American former motorsport driver and bobsled builder. He is the oldest of the three Bodine brothers (with Brett Bodine and Todd Bodine), and sister Denise. Bodine lives in West Melbourne, Florida.

Bodine was born into a racing family as his father and grandfather, Eli Bodine Jr. and Sr. built Chemung Speedrome just a year after he was born. He began learning his racing skills at this track in the micro-midget division when he was only five years old. He had such an itch to race that he disguised himself as a lady and entered an event known as the Powder Puff Derby when he was 15.

==NASCAR Modified driver==
Bodine was already an accomplished driver before he hit the big-time in NASCAR&#x27;s premier division, the Winston Cup Series, with his first start in 1979. By this time, Bodine was well known as a Modified driver in the Northeast, racing against popular drivers such as Richie Evans, Jerry Cook, Jimmy Spencer, Ron Bouchard, and others. Bodine earned Modified championships at Stafford Speedway, Shangri-La Speedway, Spencer Speedway, and Utica-Rome Speedway. He has won many of the big races in Modifieds including the Lancaster 200 (1978, 1981), Race of Champions (1972 – Trenton), the Stafford 200 (1978), the Trenton Dogleg 200 (1979), the Thompson 300, the Spring Sizzler (1980 – Stafford Speedway), Oswego Classic (1981), Cardinal Classic (1975 – Martinsville Speedway), Oxford 250 (1980, 1981), and other modified events.

In 1978, Bodine won more races than any other Modified driver in recorded history. Driving cars owned by Dick Armstrong with Billy Taylor and Ralph Hop Harrington as crew chief, Bodine started 84 feature events and won 55 of them. Among the most prestigious of these victories were the Race of Champions at Pocono, the Spring Sizzler at Stafford, the Budweiser 200 at Oswego, both major events at Martinsville, the Thompson 300, and a sweep of the six-race Yankee All-Star League series. For these fifty-five victories, Bodine is credited in the Guinness Book of World Records with &quot;Most wins in one season&quot;.

Bodine&#x27;s racing background also included wins in the Late Model division, Nationwide Series division, and others. He has six Busch Grand National wins to his credit.

==NASCAR Winston Cup career==
Bodine is best known for his NASCAR Winston Cup career, and in his first full season in Winston Cup came in 1982 he earned Rookie of the Year honors. His first Winston Cup pole that year on his 19th start (1982 Firecracker 400) and scored his first Winston Cup victory two years later on his 69th start at Martinsville in 1984. This win was also the first win for Hendrick Motorsports, which was the team Bodine was racing for at the time. Bodine&#x27;s biggest win came at the 1986 Daytona 500, NASCAR&#x27;s premier event. Other career highlights include the 1987 International Race of Champions championship, the 1992 Busch Clash, the 1994 Winston Select (despite a first segment spinout), and the 1994 Busch Pole Award (now Budweiser Pole Award). Bodine&#x27;s final win in NASCAR&#x27;s highest division came in the &quot;Bud At The Glen&quot; in August 1996 when fortuitous pit stop timing led to him taking the lead in his QVC Thunderbird while the other drivers pitted. Bodine managed to hold off the field the rest of the way beating Terry Labonte to the line by 0.44 seconds to claim victory.

===Cup career highlights===

After a few tumultuous years in Winston Cup, Bodine saw his career launch off the ground when he ran the #5 car for Hendrick Motorsports. He spent over 28 years in the sport, with his most successful years being between 1984 and 1996. Bodine has driven for some of the best car owners in NASCAR, including Junior Johnson, Bud Moore and Rick Hendrick as well as owning his own cars, which he ran for several seasons after buying the assets of Alan Kulwicki&#x27;s race team after his death in 1993. He has 565 starts, 37 poles, 18 wins, and nearly $16 million in winnings during his Winston Cup/Nextel Cup career. He was honored as one of &quot;NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers&quot; during NASCAR&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration. Bodine has always been a great innovator and brought many ideas to Winston Cup. He introduced power steering and full-faced helmets to Winston Cup. He was also the last driver to win a race and lap the field, in the fall 1994 race at North Wilkesboro Speedway. He holds the track record at Atlanta Motor Speedway from his polesitting run after the track was repaved in 1997, with a speed of over 197 mph.

===Rivalry with Dale Earnhardt===
During the late 1980s, Bodine and seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt became embroiled in a rivalry. An incident in the 1987 running of The Winston triggered harsh feelings when Earnhardt knocked Bodine and Bill Elliott out of the way to win the $200,000 purse. NASCAR later fined Bodine $1,000 and put him on probation for three weeks. Six days later, the rivalry intensified when Bodine tagged Earnhardt in a Busch Grand National Series race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Bodine and team owner Rick Hendrick claimed the wreck was unintentional, but NASCAR disagreed, fining Bodine another $15,000 and extending his probation to the end of 1987. Bodine later appealed and the penalty was revoked.

At the same Busch race in 1988, Earnhardt spun Bodine, and the New Yorker later retired from the race, later going over to Earnhardt&#x27;s Cup car and drawing an &quot;X&quot; in the air over the car with his hand. The following day, while being passed by Bodine in the 1988 Coca-Cola 600, Earnhardt wrecked Bodine&#x27;s car, leading NASCAR to assess a five-lap penalty on Earnhardt. Bodine&#x27;s car owner, Rick Hendrick, claimed the penalty was too light, while Earnhardt&#x27;s car owner Richard Childress thought the penalty was too harsh. Two days later, officials from the sanctioning body brought both drivers and car owners together for a meeting in Daytona Beach, Florida, where all involved parties settled their disputes.

Bodine would later say, in a 2015 article with the Racing Experts website, that he and Earnhardt were friends and got along well in their early racing days. They had dinner parties, and their children played with each other. However, when both drivers joined the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, their relationship changed, and they grew distant from each other. By the time the rivalry had begun, both drivers were at the prime of their careers, which partly contributed to the heated incidents with each other. Although the rivalry was put to an end by the NASCAR dinner meeting, both teams, and Bodine still have a difference of opinion on who was mostly responsible for it. In his autobiography, Bodine dedicated a chapter about Earnhardt where he spoke about their rivalry and his impact but closed it by stating, “And I found out after Dale’s death that he actually hated me.” 

===Daytona crash===

While competing the inaugural Daytona 250 Truck Series race at Daytona International Speedway, on February 18, 2000, Bodine was involved in a vicious, fiery accident on the 57th lap of the race while driving the No. 15 Ford F-150 for Billy Ballew.

The crash started when then-rookie Kurt Busch, Rob Morgan, and Lyndon Amick were racing three-wide through the tri-oval front straightaway. In the exact moment Bodine moved to get around the outside of the trio, Morgan was turned across Busch&#x27;s nose into the side of Amick&#x27;s truck, who was at the bottom. Amick&#x27;s truck was damaged in the contact, which caused it to veer hard right, pushing Morgan into Bodine who was on the outside. The contact between Morgan&#x27;s front right tire and Bodine&#x27;s front left tire caused the front of Bodine&#x27;s truck to vault upwards over the outside retaining wall, sending his truck into the catch fencing nose first, at a speed of nearly .

The force of the impact completely tore the front of the truck into pieces and ruptured its fuel cell, leaving only small parts of the roll cage intact. Just as Bodine was coming back down to the track, it was hit driver&#x27;s side by Lonnie Rush Jr., which caused it to roll down the frontstretch. As it tumbled, it got hit yet again, this time by Jimmy Kitchens, which ignited the fuel that was spilling out of the tank. Bodine rolled nine times before coming to rest on his roof. The accident was so severe, the announcers, crew members and fans all believed that Bodine had been killed. Thirteen other trucks were involved, making it one of the largest wrecks in NASCAR Truck Series history. As a result of the collision, Bodine suffered fractures in his right wrist, right cheekbone, a vertebra in his back, and his right ankle; he also suffered a concussion. Kitchens was also hospitalized after his contact with Bodine. However, he suffered no serious injuries. Nine spectators were also injured in the crash.

Incredibly, Bodine missed only ten races of the 2000 Winston Cup season while recovering from his injuries, returning at Richmond International Raceway on May 6 and finishing 13th in a 400-lap race. However, Bodine&#x27;s struggles over the ensuing months led to his dismissal from the team in September. In a feat of great accomplishment, he returned in the 2002 Daytona 500 to finish third behind race winner Ward Burton and second-placer finisher Elliott Sadler. However, including that race, Bodine only managed to make 18 starts in the NASCAR Cup Series between 2001 and 2004, with only one Top 5 and two Top 10&#x27;s both in 2002. He attempted to qualify for the 2004 Brickyard 400 driving for Gary Trout Autosports, but was unable to and made no more attempts at any other races that year.

===Racing twilight===
Geoff, brother Todd, and Larry Gunselman started a race team in 2009. Geoff attempted to qualify the No. 64 Toyota for the 2009 Daytona 500. In 2010, Geoff returned to the Camping World Truck Series for the first time since 2004 with Team Gill Racing at Atlanta. He finished 26th with engine problems despite qualifying an impressive 8th. In 2011, he drove for Tommy Baldwin Racing in the Sprint Cup Series, alternating between the Nos. 35 and 36 teams, with sponsorship from Luke &amp; Associates.

===Retirement===
In October 2012, Bodine announced through TheRacingExperts.Com that he was retiring from NASCAR after 27 seasons. Bodine said he wanted to spend time with his family and do charitable deeds.

In June 2012 he opened a Honda Power Sports dealership in West Melbourne, Florida, where he currently resides.

As of August 2014, Bodine is a Driver Analyst for The Racing Experts, the website that announced his retirement in 2012. He is a contributing columnist with articles published monthly.

Bodine has a book coming out in 2024, titled “All Of It,” per his social media pages.

==Bo-Dyn bobsleds==

Bodine is the co-owner of the Bo-Dyn Bobsled Company. His bobsled interest came about while watching the 1992 Winter Olympics when the U.S. Bobsled team was having a tough time during competition. Bodine learned that the sleds being used were all imported and not built domestically. He felt that he could help the team win with better technology derived from his race car experience, engineering background, as well as the abundant design and construction resources offered to him through his NASCAR connections. With his interest captured, Bodine took a few runs in a bobsled at Lake Placid to confirm his feelings and to learn more about the sleds.

Bo-Dyn Bobsleds (Bo for Bodine, &quot;Dyn&quot; for Chassis Dynamics) was created in 1992 by Bodine and his good friend and chassis builder, Bob Cuneo of Chassis Dynamics. Bodine founded the USA Bobsled Project to help create a winning bobsled for the U.S. teams. The U.S. National Team first used their sleds in 1994. Ten years after Bo-Dyn&#x27;s inception, the U.S. team won three medals in Bo-Dyn Bobsleds during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, American bobsledder Steven Holcomb piloted a Bo-Dyn Bobsled named &quot;Night Train&quot; to gold. Every January from 2006 to 2010 at the Lake Placid, New York track, a charity run is held with the US bobsled team and NASCAR drivers to raise money for the sled project. Participants have included Todd Bodine (one of Bodine&#x27;s brothers) and Tony Stewart.

<doc id="606534" wikidata="Q3959575" url="?curid=606534" title="Shining Light">
<text>&quot;Shining Light&quot; is a song by Ash, which was released as the first single from their album &quot;Free All Angels&quot;. It was released on 29 January 2001. It was released as a single CD (released on 2CD formats) and as a 7-inch vinyl (which came with a picture sleeve). It was also Ash&#x27;s first single to be released as an enhanced CD. &quot;Shining Light&quot; reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The song had been covered by fellow Downpatrick songwriter Triona in 2015 which featured on a Power NI advert.

==Recording history==
&quot;Shining Light&quot; was written about Tim Wheeler&#x27;s now ex-girlfriend Audrey. Wheeler was driving home in his car when the line and tune &quot;Yeah you are a shining light&quot; came into his head. He rushed home and wrote it straight away on an acoustic guitar. The first time the band heard it, they say that they &#x27;knew it was a hit&#x27;.

&quot;Shining Light&quot; was first played at a London Astoria gig in 2000, and is considered to be one of the band&#x27;s greatest achievements, musically and lyrically. Ash once said of the song:

*Tim: &quot;I think Shining Light&#x27;s a breath of fresh air&quot;
*Rick: &quot;It&#x27;s a very melodic song, it sticks in your head, so we thought it&#x27;d have a pretty good chance of getting in the Top 10. It was good being back there &#x27;cos it&#x27;s been a long time, over two years since we had a single out&quot;.
*Charlotte: &quot;It was the first song we recorded and we knew it would be the first single&quot;.

The song was extremely critically acclaimed and won, among others:

* Ivor Novello Awards 2001 - Best Contemporary Song
* Irish Music Awards 2002 - Best Single

&quot;Shining Light&quot; can also be found on Ash&#x27;s greatest hits compilation, &quot;Intergalactic Sonic 7″s&quot; as well as on the &quot;Tokyo Blitz&quot; DVD.

The song was re-recorded by Canadian artist Emm Gryner on her 2005 album &quot;Songs of Love and Death&quot;. In addition, this was the song played on the last episode of &quot;Roswell&quot; as the group in the series drives away forever - signifying the death of the series. It has also been covered by Coldplay and Noel Gallagher claims it to be one of his favourite songs.

===B-Sides===
The B-side &quot;Warmer Than Fire&quot; was originally written by Steve Ludwin of Little Hell. The song was intended to be a download only release for fans, but due to its immense popularity it was released on the &quot;Shining Light&quot; single as well as on the &quot;Cosmic Debris&quot; b-side collection. The song has also been performed several times live in concert. Rumours that Wheeler bought the royalties for the song from Ludwin for £35 have been denied by the band.

&quot;Warmer than Fire&quot; also had its own music video, directed by Darren Tiernan (Wheeler&#x27;s cousin). It consists of footage of the band messing around in Puerto Banus, Spain, where &quot;Free All Angels&quot; was being recorded and climaxes in a burning of a piano. The video cost very little and has rarely been seen.

&quot;Gabriel&quot; also appears on CD1 (as well as on the &quot;Cosmic Debris&quot; collection) and is considered to be quite a retro-sounding Ash track, reminiscent of &quot;Innocent Smile&quot; on &quot;1977&quot;.

&quot;Feel No Pain&quot; is the first b-side on CD2, and was one of the leftover tracks from the &quot;Free All Angels&quot; recording session. The song is mainly about actually writing a song.

&quot;Jesus Says&quot; originally released on the &quot;Nu-Clear Sounds&quot; appears as a remix entitled the &quot;Hedrock Valley Beats Lightyear 12-inch mix which appears on CD2.

&quot;Shining Light&quot; has been used as song in advert for Toyota cars in Croatia.

There are three separate edits of &quot;Shining Light.&quot; The album version is 5:09 in length and features an extended bridge. The song was edited for radio too at 4:07 with a shortened bridge and guitar solo. The third edit of the song was for the &quot;Cosmic Debris&quot; collection and is 4:23 in length. The band played the song live according to this edit at many gigs from the Free All Angels tour onwards, however on their latest tour in 2007, the longest version was played.

==Appearances in popular media==
&quot;Shining Light&quot; was the closing song in the last episode of the American science fiction television series &quot;Roswell&quot;.

&quot;Shining Light&quot; also appears as the background music for the special film on the racehorse Fantastic Light, which appeared on the 2005 Darley Stud Stud Book.

&quot;Shining Light&quot; features as a background track in Season 2 Episode 9 of the Channel 4 TV Series, &quot;Teachers&quot;

The version recorded by Annie Lennox was used as Elaine Hammond&#x27;s (Sigourney Weaver) theme song in the US mini-series &quot;Political Animals&quot;.

==Annie Lennox version==
Annie Lennox&#x27;s cover of &quot;Shining Light&quot; was released as the first single from &quot;The Annie Lennox Collection&quot;. It was one of her most &#x27;pop&#x27; recordings for some time. The video, which features Lennox singing with an all-woman band (all played by Lennox) in a brightly lit multi-coloured studio, was premiered on MSN Music on 30 January 2009. The cover attracted praise, with Tim Wheeler from Ash saying, &quot;It&#x27;s cool – I&#x27;m really into it. It makes me proud that someone of her stature and talent is doing something different with our song,&quot; and Popjustice making it its Song of the Day on 8 January 2009, saying &quot;…after about 90 seconds it sounds like the greatest noise ever invented by a human&quot;. Lennox performed the song on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; on 6 March 2009 and also on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; (9 March), &quot;The One Show&quot; (10 March), &quot;This Morning&quot; (11 March) and was also part of Comic Relief on 13 March 2009. The single was only available by download via Amazon or iTunes. The single became Lennox&#x27;s first UK top 40 hit as a solo artist since 1995, reaching number 39. (She had reached the top 40 as a member of Eurythmics on three occasions in the interim.) It is also Lennox&#x27;s final UK top 40 hit to date.

<text>Perth Zoo is a zoological park in South Perth, Western Australia. The zoo first opened in 1898 and by 2011 housed 1258 animals of 164 species and an extensive botanical collection.
It is a full institutional member of the Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA) and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).

==History==
The Perth Zoological Gardens were opened on 17 October 1898 by the Governor of Western Australia, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Gerard Smith. Planning for the zoo had started in 1896 when the Acclimatisation Society first met, the original purpose of which was to introduce European animals to Australia and establish a zoo for conservation purposes. In 1897 this group invited the director of the Melbourne Zoo, Albert Le Souef, to choose a site. His son Ernest was chosen as the first director of the Perth Zoo, and work began in 1897.

The first exhibits built included two bear caves, a monkey house, a mammal house and a model castle for guinea pigs. The first animals on display included an orangutan, two monkeys, four ostriches, a pair of lions, and a tiger. At first there were only six staff members. The zoo had 53,000 visitors in its first nine months, and had not been closed for a single day since it was opened, until it was temporarily closed from 24 March 2020 during the coronavirus outbreak.

From the start Ernest Le Souef worked to create a botanical collection as well as an animal collection to preserve for the future. Work on the gardens started as soon as the site was chosen and finalised. Since the site was mostly sand and lacked nutrients and water, loads of manure needed to be brought in, and a well was bored in 1898 to allow irrigation. The zoo included rose gardens, lupin fields, tropical plants, and palms. The original palm collection still stands and boasts over 61 species including Canary Island date palms that are now over 110 years old. The zoo also grew crops for animals including lettuce, alfalfa, carrots, lucerne and onions. This tradition is still alive, with the zoo producing fodder including hibiscus, bamboo, Fijian fire plant and mirror plant.

In 1909, the zoo hosted the Australasian Championships in tennis, the precursor to the modern Australian Open. The Zoological Gardens Courts, now Perth Zoo&#x27;s main lawn, were considered the state&#x27;s best tennis facilities at the time.

In 2010/11, the zoo had a paid staff of about 248 (167 full-time equivalents), plus about 300 volunteer docents.

Until her death in July 2022 aged 65, Tricia a female Asian elephant was one of the most famous animal residents at Perth Zoo, having lived at the zoo for 59 years since 1963. After living nearly twenty years on her own, she was joined by three rescued orphan three year old Asian elephants from Malaysia in December 1992 (of which male Putra Mas still reside at the zoo until June 2025). Tricia was euthanised by zoo veterinarians due to ongoing age-related health issues. After a cremation her ashes were placed under a forty year old 15 metre tall jacaranda tree on the zoo&#x27;s Main Lawn, a memory plaque to be unveiled in her memory. Additionally a conservation guard hut in Sumatra was named in her honour. Following in the direction of many contemporary city zoos, Perth Zoo plans to find homes for Asian elephants Permai and Putra Mas at open-range zoos either nationally or overseas, and will no longer house elephants in the near future. In August 2023 the decision was made to move the remaining elephants to next door South Australia, at Monarto Safari Park. Permai departed Perth Zoo on January 27, 2025 for Monarto, while Putra Mas is set to depart in June 2025.

Additionally the zoo has had several other noteworthy individual animals in both record longevity and significant contribution to global endangered species captive breeding programs. Puan a female Sumatran orangutan (born 1956) was gifted to the zoo by Sultan Ismail of Johore in 1968 along with three other orangutans. She had 11 offspring, and at the time of her death in 2018 aged 62 (a world record for her species) had 54 living descendants in various zoos around the world and even some released into the wild. Northern white-cheeked gibbon Phillip lived at Perth Zoo from September 1974 to July 2023 and is the record holder of longevity for the males of his species, and had fathered many offspring who in turn have been significant members of the global captive breeding program for the critically endangered species.

===Governance===

==Exhibits==

Perth Zoo largest three precincts are (alphabetically) the African Savannah, the Asian Rainforest and the Australian Bushwalk, with many others including the Australian Wetlands, Nocturnal House, Penguin Plunge, Primate Trail, Reptile Encounter and the zoo&#x27;s Main Lake. All the exhibits are designed to mimic the animals&#x27; natural habitats and utilise passive barriers where possible, to improve the wellbeing of the animals.
----

;African Savannah

The African Savannah (opened in 1991) replaced a variety of barred cages, and was the largest construction project undertaken at the zoo when it was created. The exhibit recreates the African savannah. Visitors view the animals from a path that simulates a dry riverbed running through the savannah. The resident animals are:
* African lion
* African painted dog
* Cape porcupine
* Meerkat
* Plains zebra

* Radiated tortoise
* Ring-tailed lemur
* Rothschild&#x27;s giraffe
* Southern white rhinoceros
* Spotted hyena

*(additionally although actually natives to the continent and islands off South American respectively, exhibits close to the boundaries of the &#x27;African Savannah&#x27; area can be found for Bolivian squirrel monkey and a pair of Galapagos tortoise).


;Asian Rainforest

The Asian Rainforest (opened in phases between 1984 and 2007) is home to a number of threatened Asian species. These include:
* Asian elephant
* Asian small-clawed otter
* Javan gibbon
* Komodo dragon

* Nepalese red panda
* Northern white-cheeked gibbon
* Sumatran orangutan
* Sumatran tiger
* Sun bear

Perth Zoo contributes to the conservation of many of these species in the wild. 

;Australian Bushwalk

The Australia Bushwalk (opened in its current setup in 1997) takes visitors on a journey through the Australian landscape where they can see:
* Bush stone-curlew
* Emu
* Koala
* Red kangaroo
* Short-beaked echidna
* Tammar wallaby
* Tasmanian devil
* Western brush wallaby
* Western grey kangaroo

A specially designed exhibit in this area visitors can access on a slight detour is the &#x27;Numbats Under Threat&#x27; exhibit, which showcases the endangered Western Australian marsupial and several other species in both the large main enclosure and the walkthrough exhibit fronting the entrance. The species in this area are:
* Numbat
* Quokka
* Rufous whistler
* Splendid fairy-wren

Another detour takes visitors to the &#x27;Western Australian Black Cockatoo&#x27; exhibit aviaries, planted with cockatoo food trees and home to:
* Baudin&#x27;s cockatoo

The zoo&#x27;s &#x27;Rainforest Retreat&#x27; (planted between 1994 and 1996) is 4,350 square metre area of the zoo which showcases botanical flora of the tropical zones of the world through a winding rainforest path. Additionally several species of threatened frogs have been bred and raised in this area of the zoo for wild release including 
sunset frog, orange-bellied frog and white-bellied frog.

==Scenic Heritage Trail==

(a map of which can be downloaded from the website or collected from the Information Centre) is a self-guided walk that takes visitors around the zoo and shows off its historical buildings. Buildings included in this walk are the bird feed shed, kite cage, bear caves, hay shed, mineral baths from 1898, replicas of tennis shelters from 1903, the Scout Hall built in 1931, the 1947 carousel that is still in use, and the Gate Zoo Residence that was built in the 1960s.

==Conservation==

The zoo participates in a number of breeding programs for endangered species, both native Australian and non-native species. Some Australian species are bred for release into managed habitat in Western Australia, whereas the international species are for increasing genetic diversification in zoo population.

;Exotic species

Perth Zoo contributes to the conservation of threatened species in the wild through its fundraising program, Wildlife Conservation Action. Started in 2007, funds raised have been used for the conservation of African painted dogs, Asian elephants, Goodfellow&#x27;s tree-kangaroos, Javan gibbons, northern white-cheeked gibbons, Rothschild&#x27;s giraffes, southern white rhinoceroses, Sumatran orangutans, Sumatran tigers, and sun bears. More than $881,000 has been raised since the program began.

Many individuals of these species have been born at the zoo and later contributed to further generations of international and regional captive-breeding programs.

The zoo&#x27;s Sumatran orangutan breeding program is one of the most successful in the world, having bred twenty-three Sumatran orangutans between 1970 and 2012 (and additionally eight hybrid Bornean-Sumatran orangutans in the 1970s before difference species status was known, the hybrid orangutans were later sent to zoos in India). In 2006, 2011 and 2016 zoo-born Sumatran orangutans were released into the wild in Bukit Tigapuluh National Park in Sumatra as part of an international program to re-establish a wild population of the critically endangered ape.

Since 2006, Perth Zoo has made a significant contribution to conservation projects in the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park and the surrounding forested areas which support a rich diversity of life including a new colony of orangutans. These orangutans are part of an international program to reintroduce rescued ex-pet and orphaned Sumatran orangutans into the wild to establish a new population of this critically endangered species. More than 139 orangutans have been released into the area and some have bred.

In November 2006, Perth Zoo released 14-year-old, Perth Zoo-born Sumatran orangutan Temara into Bukit Tigapuluh as part of the reintroduction program. Temara was the first zoo-born orangutan in the world to be released into the wild. This was followed in 2011 with the release of the first male zoo-born orangutan, Semeru, into the wild, and in 2016 by another male Nyaru in the wild of Sumatra. Perth Zoo works with the Frankfurt Zoological Society, Indonesian Government and the Australian Orangutan Project on this program and other conservation activities in Bukit Tigapuluh.

Puteri (born 1970) the first of the Sumatran orangutan to be born at the zoo, she has lived at Perth Zoo for more than 50 years (her entire life) and in-turn has birthed six second generation Sumatran orangutans (including Temara, mentioned above).

;Native species

The zoo&#x27;s Wildlife Conservation Action fundraising program has also contributed towards native Australian species under threat in the wild.

Working with the Department of Environment and Conservation, Perth Zoo breeds threatened Western Australian animal species for release into managed areas of habitat in the wild as part of its Native Species Breeding Program. As of 2011, Perth Zoo breeds species including dibblers, numbats, western swamp turtles, woylies and threatened Western Australian frog species.
The numbat (&quot;Myrmecobius fasciatus&quot;) Western Australia&#x27;s mammal emblem and one of only two diurnal marsupials, the numbat is the only Australian mammal to feed exclusively on termites. Despite the establishment of several populations by the Department of Environment and Conservation, it is still classified as endangered by the IUCN. Perth Zoo has been breeding numbats for release into the wild since 1986. The first successful birth was in 1993. By early 2011, 165 numbats had been provided by the zoo for release into protected habitat. In 2022 Perth Zoo bred 13 numbat joeys, and released 10 of them (and a wild rescued female) into Mallee Cliffs National Park in New South Wales.

The western swamp turtle (&quot;Pseudemydura umbrina&quot;) is a short-necked freshwater turtle and Australia&#x27;s most critically endangered reptile. The western swamp tortoise has only been recorded at scattered localities in a narrow, three-to-five kilometre strip of the Swan Coastal Plain. Since 1988, Perth Zoo has bred more than 500 western swamp tortoises. The main barrier to the further recovery of the species is the lack of suitable habitat.
Despite this barrier, in 2022 Perth Zoo released 191 western swamp turtles into Scott National Park and bush around Moore River area.

The dibbler (&quot;Paranthechinus apicalis&quot;) is a small carnivorous marsupial found on two islands off the coast of Jurien Bay (island dibblers) and on the south coast of Western Australia within the Fitzgerald River National Park (mainland dibblers). It once had a much wider distribution, but is now classified as endangered by the IUCN. Perth-Zoo-bred dibblers were used to establish a new population on Escape Island in Jurien Bay. The focus has now changed to breeding dibblers from Fitzgerald River National Park for release on the mainland. By early 2011, over 500 dibblers had been provided by the zoo for release into protected habitat. Additionally between 2019 and 2023, 203 dibblers bred at Perth Zoo have been released into Dirk Hartog Island National Park. The Dibbler conservation breeding program was completed in 2023 after 26 years (beginning 1997) with 1,173 captive bred individuals born and released into protected wilderness areas during the program.

The frog breeding program is seeking to increase populations of threatened species, including those listed as vulnerable &quot;Spicospina flammocaerulea&quot; (sunset frog) and &quot;Geocrinia vitellina&quot; (orange-bellied frog), and the critically endangered &quot;Anstisia alba&quot; (white-bellied frog), the latter species being one example of the zoo&#x27;s success with its captive breeding programs, having bred and released 1,250 white-bellied frogs back into the wild.

Previous breeding programs include:

The chuditch (&quot;Dasyurus geoffroi&quot;) or western quoll, is one of four quoll species in Australia and is the largest marsupial predator in Western Australia. At the time of European settlement, chuditch occurred in approximately 70% of the continent. By the late 1980s, they had become endangered, with less than 6,000 remaining in the south-west of Western Australia. Perth Zoo has bred more than 300 chuditch for release in the last decade. Since the breeding program began, the status of chuditch has been modified from endangered to vulnerable. This breeding program is now complete.

Shark Bay mouse (&quot;Pseudomys fieldi&quot;) also known as djoongari, prior to 1993 the only known population of djoongari was on Bernier Island in the north-west of Western Australia, adjacent to the Shark Bay region and was considered to be one of Australia&#x27;s most geographically restricted animals. Over 300 Perth-Zoo-bred djoongari have been released to sites on the mainland and on islands in the north-west of Western Australia. This breeding program is now complete.

The central rock-rat (&quot;Zyzomys pedunculatus&quot;) is a critically endangered rodent that was presumed extinct until it was rediscovered in the MacDonnell Ranges Northern Territory in 1996. The last of the zoo&#x27;s central rock rats were sent to Alice Springs Desert Park in 2007 and the breeding program closed.

<doc id="606547" wikidata="Q918361" url="?curid=606547" title="Alfred Loisy">
<text>Alfred Firmin Loisy () (28 February 18571 June 1940) was a French Roman Catholic priest, professor and theologian generally credited as a founder of modernism in the Roman Catholic Church. He was a critic of traditional views of the interpretation of the Bible, and argued that biblical criticism could be helpful for a theological interpretation of the Bible.

He famously wrote &quot;Jesus announced the kingdom, and it is the Church that came&quot;.

His theological positions brought him into conflict with the church&#x27;s authorities, including Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X. In 1893, he was dismissed as a professor from the Institut Catholique de Paris. His books were condemned by the Roman Curia, and in 1908 he was excommunicated.

== Education ==
Born on 28 February 1857 at Ambrières, Loisy was put into the ecclesiastical school of Saint-Dizier at four years old. He decided for the priesthood and was educated from 1874 to 1879 at the Grand séminaire de Châlons-en-Champagne; he entered the Institut Catholique de Paris in 1878/1879. Prior to his ordination to the subdiaconate, he had experienced doubts regarding the soundness of the Catholic faith. After an illness he returned to the Institut and was ordained a priest on 29 June 1879. Initially assigned parish work, in 1881 he requested to be reassigned to the Institut to complete his baccalauréat in theology. That autumn he became instructor in Hebrew. He took additional courses in Hebrew with Ernest Renan at the Collège de France. He was also influenced, as to biblical languages and textual criticism, by the Abbé Paulin Martin, and as to a consciousness of the biblical problems and a sense of form by the historical intuition and irony of Abbé Louis Duchesne. He took his theological degree in March 1890, by the oral defense of forty Latin scholastic theses and by a French dissertation, &quot;Histoire du canon de l&#x27;ancien testament&quot;, published as his first book in that year.

== Early Biblical criticism ==
Some of his work appeared in the bi-monthly &quot;L&#x27;Enseignement biblique&quot;, a periodical written throughout and published by himself. In November 1893, Loisy published the last lecture of his course, in which he summed up his position on Biblical criticism in five propositions: the Pentateuch was not the work of Moses, the first five chapters of Genesis were not literal history, the New Testament and the Old Testament did not possess equal historical value, there was a development in scriptural doctrine, and Biblical writings were subject to the same limitations as those by other authors of the ancient world. This resulted in Loisy&#x27;s dismissal from his teaching position. A few days later Pope Leo XIII published the encyclical &quot;Providentissimus Deus&quot;, which indirectly condemned Abbé Loisy&#x27;s and Mgr d&#x27;Hulst&#x27;s position, and rendered the continued publication of consistently critical work so difficult that Loisy himself suppressed his &quot;Enseignement&quot; at the end of 1893.

==Historical apologetics for the development of the Catholic Church==
His 1908 &quot;Les Évangiles Synoptiques&quot; would cause his excommunication. In his works he argued against the views of Adolf von Harnack, the German Lutheran theologian, who was trying to show that it was necessary and inevitable for the Catholic Church to form as it did. In doing so, Loisy implicitly accepted the eschatology of Johannes Weiss (this eschatology is named &quot;consistent eschatology&quot;): Jesus thought the coming of the Kingdom was imminent, so there was no point in founding a Church. Only after his death and resurrection was his original proclamation of the Kingdom transformed into this sense by his disciples, and legitimately so, as Loisy pointed out against Harnack&#x27;s conception of Christianity: The second part of the quotation echoes Cardinal Newman&#x27;s theory on the development of Christian doctrine which Loisy had studied in his time at Neuilly. Although &quot;L&#x27;Évangile et L&#x27;Église&quot; in particular was condemned by Cardinal Richard, Pope Leo consistently refused to interfere directly. It was his successor, Pope Pius X who would later condemn these works.

Another controversial thesis of Loisy, developed in &quot;La Religion d&#x27;Israël&quot;, is the distinction between a pre-Moses period, when the Hebrews worshipped the god El, also known by the plural of this name, Elohim, and a later stage, when Yahweh gradually became the only deity of the Jews.

==Pope Pius X==
Cardinal Sarto became Pope Pius X on 4 August 1903. On 1 October, Loisy published three new books, &quot;Autour d&#x27;un petit livre&quot;, &quot;Le Quatrième Évangile&quot; and &quot;Le Discours sur la Montagne&quot; (a fragment of a proposed enlarged commentary on the Synoptic Gospels). &quot;Autour&quot; consists of seven letters on different topics addressed to church leaders and friends. Urged by the Parisian Archbishop Cardinal Richard, Pius X transferred the scrutiny of Loisy&#x27;s books, started under Leo XIII in 1901 under the Congregation of the Index, to the Holy Office. By 23 December 1903, the Congregation censured Loisy&#x27;s main exegetical works: &quot;Religion d&#x27;Israël&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Évangile et l&#x27;Église&quot;, &quot;Études évangéliques&quot;, &quot;Autour d&#x27;un petit livre&quot; and &quot;Le Quatrième Évangile&quot;.

=== Condemnation ===
On 12 January 1904 Loisy wrote to the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Merry del Val, that he received the condemnation with respect, and condemned whatever might be reprehensible in his books, whilst reserving the rights of his conscience and his opinions as an historian. The Holy See was not satisfied, and Loisy sent three further declarations; the last, dispatched on 17 March, was addressed to the pope himself, and remained unanswered. At the end of March, Loisy gave up his lectureship, as he declared, on his own initiative. In April 1907 he returned to his native Lorraine, to his relatives in Ceffonds near Montier-en-Der.

In 1904 the Holy Office began to compile a syllabus of errors in the works of Loisy. Due to ongoing internal resistance, especially from the Master of the Sacred Palace, the papal theologian Alberto Lepidi, this syllabus was published only in July 1907 as the decree &quot;Lamentabili sane exitu&quot; (or &quot;A Lamentable Departure Indeed&quot;); it condemned sixty-five propositions from the field of biblical interpretation and the history of dogma. They concerned the nature of the church, revelation, biblical exegesis, the sacraments, and the divinity of Christ. This was soon followed by the encyclical &quot;Pascendi dominici gregis&quot; (&quot;Feeding the Lord&#x27;s Flock&quot;), which characterized modernism as the &quot;synthesis of all heresies&quot;. The documents made Loisy realise that there was no hope for reconciliation of his views with official Catholic doctrine. He made a comparative study of the papal documents to show the condemned propositions in his own writings. He also asserted as true various of his earlier New Testament interpretations, which previously he had formulated in conditional form. In his diary he wrote:

His Catholic critics commented that his religious system envisioned a great society which he believed to be the historically developed Church. For many, the attitude of Loisy and his followers was incomprehensible. While Modernists asked, &quot;How can the Church survive?&quot;, for Pius X the question was, &quot;How can these men be priests?&quot;

The censure did not deter Loisy from publishing three further books. &quot;Les Évangiles synoptiques&quot;, two large volumes of 1,009 and 798 pages, appeared in January 1908. This contains a detailed commentary on the Synoptic Gospels, combining the ecclesiastical tradition, modern criticism, the Gospel narrative, and the tradition of the text and the previous commentaries. The commentary gives also a careful translation of the texts. Loisy recognizes two eye-witness documents, as utilized by all three Gospels. He traces a strong Pauline influence, especially in the Gospel of Mark. Yet the great bulk of the sayings is acknowledged as substantially authentic; if the historicity of certain words and acts is here denied with unusual assurance, that of other sayings and deeds is established with stronger proofs; and the redemptive conception of the Passion and the sacramental interpretation of the Last Supper are found to spring up promptly and legitimately from Christ&#x27;s work and words.

The third book, &quot;Simples Réflexions sur le décret Lamentabili et sur l&#x27;encyclique Pascendi&quot; (277 pages), was published from Ceffonds a few days after the commentary. Each proposition of the decree is carefully tracked to its probable source, and is often found to modify the latter&#x27;s meaning. The study of the encyclical concludes: &quot;Time is the great teacher […] we would do wrong to despair either of our civilization or of the Church.&quot;

The ecclesiastical authorities were not slow to act. On 14 February 1908 Léon-Adolphe Amette, archbishop of Paris, prohibited his diocesans to read or defend the two books, which &quot;attack and deny several fundamental dogmas of Christianity,&quot; under pain of excommunication.

=== Excommunication ===
Loisy was excommunicated &quot;vitandus&quot; on 7 March 1908.

After his excommunication Loisy became a secular intellectual. He was appointed Chair of History of Religions in the Collège de France in 1909 and served there until retiring in 1931. In that post, he continued to develop his philosophy, describing the Christian religion as a humanist system of ethics rather than divine. He also developed his studies of early religions and their influence on Christianity. He never recanted, and died in 1940 in Ceffonds.

<doc id="606554" wikidata="Q1224467" url="?curid=606554" title="List of death deities">
<text>The mythology or religion of most cultures incorporate a god of death or, more frequently, a divine being closely associated with death, an afterlife, or an underworld. They are often amongst the most powerful and important entities in a given tradition, reflecting the fact that death, like birth, is central to the human experience. In religions where a single god is the primary object of worship, the representation of death is usually that god&#x27;s antagonist, and the struggle between the two is central to the folklore of the culture. In such dualistic models, the primary deity usually represents good, and the death god embodies evil. Similarly, death worship is used as a derogatory term to accuse certain groups of morally abhorrent practices which set no value on human life. In monotheistic religions, death is commonly personified by an angel or demon standing in opposition to the god.

==Occurrence==
In polytheistic religions which have a complex system of deities governing various natural phenomena and aspects of human life, it is common to have a deity who is assigned the function of presiding over death. This deity may actually take the life of humans or, more commonly, simply rule over the afterlife in that particular belief system (a single religion may have separate deities performing both tasks). The deity in question may be good, evil, or neutral and simply doing their job, in sharp contrast to a lot of modern portrayals of death deities as all being inherently evil just because death is feared. Hades from Greek mythology is an especially common target. The inclusion of such a &quot;departmental&quot; deity of death in a religion&#x27;s pantheon is not necessarily the same thing as the glorification of death.

A death deity has a good chance of being either male or female, unlike some functions that seem to steer towards one gender in particular, such as fertility and earth deities being female and storm deities being male. A single religion/mythology may have death gods of more than one gender existing at the same time and they may be envisioned as a married couple ruling over the afterlife together, as with the Aztecs, Greeks, and Romans.

In monotheistic religions, the one god governs both life and death (as well as everything else). However, in practice this manifests in different rituals and traditions and varies according to a number of factors including geography, politics, traditions, and the influence of other religions.

<text>Niulakita is the southernmost island of Tuvalu, and also the name of the only village on this island. Niulakita has a population of 34 (2017 Census). The residents of Niulakita have moved to the island from Niutao. Niulakita is represented in the Parliament of Tuvalu by the members of the constituency of Niutao.

==History==
The discovery of Niulakita is claimed by travellers from Nui, led by Kaunatu who was taking people home to Vaitupu, however their canoe drifted off course to the south and they arrived at Niulakita. There was only saltbrush (&quot;Atriplex&quot;) and &quot;pukavai&quot; trees (&quot;Pisonia grandis&quot;) on the islands. Kaeula, one of the passengers, died and was buried with the last of their coconuts planted at the head of his grave. The island was named by Kaunatu after a place of that name on Nui.

The first sighting recorded by Europeans of Niulakita was on 29 August 1595 by the Spanish navigator Alvaro de Mendaña during his second expedition encountered Niulakita. The island was charted as &quot;La Solitaria&quot; (Lonesome in Spanish). An attempt was made to find a port with two small vessels in its southern part but the bottom was uneven and rocky and they abandoned their attempts.

In 1821, Captain George Barrett, of the Nantucket whaler &quot;Independence II&quot;, visited Niulakita, which he named &quot;Rocky (Group)&quot;. This name was never much used, but &quot;Independence Island&quot;, after Barrett&#x27;s ship, was one of the several names which came into general use for Niulakita during the 19th century. Niulakita was also known as &quot;Sophia&quot;.

In about 1879, the elders of Vaitupu were interested in Niulakita and send a working party to plant coconuts on the island. However, in 1880 they were informed that J. C. Godeffroy und Sohn of Hamburg (operating out of Samoa) claimed ownership of the island. Notwithstanding this claim in 1884 the Vaitupu elders transferred their claim to Niulakita to H. M. Ruge and Company, a German trading firm that operated from Apia, for $400 in part payment of a debt of $13,000 owed to the company. Ruge &amp; Co became insolvent in about 1888. On 15 April 1889 Niulakita was sold for $1,000 to Harry Jay Moors, an American citizen living in Apia, Samoa. On 16 September 1896, Captain Herbert Gibson of HMS &quot;Curacoa&quot;, recorded in his journal that six men and six women, natives of various islands, were living on Niulakita working for Moors. Captain Gibson determined that the island was not under American protection so he hoisted the Union Jack and delivered the flag, with a copy of the Declaration of British Protectorate, to the headman of the working party.

In August 1896, the sailing ship &quot;Seladon&quot; of Stavanger was wrecked on the coral reef of Starbuck Island. The crew of 16 men were in the lifeboats with little food and water for 30 days, until they arrived at Niulakita. The crew were stranded for ten months until rescued by a passing steam ship.

In 1914, Niulakita was purchased from Moors by the Samoa Shipping Trading Co Ltd, which was owned by Captain Ernest Frederick Hughes Allen. It was bought by the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony administration in 1944. The administration gave people from Vaitupu permission to settle Niulakita. However, in 1949, a later administration decided to have Niulakita settled by the community from Niutao, which was considered to be overpopulated. The removal of the Vaitupuans was controversial.

The United States asserted a claim to Niulakita under the Guano Islands Act of 1856; this claim was renounced under the 1983 treaty of friendship between Tuvalu and the United States.

==Geography==
Niulakita is a reef island. There are four ponds or lakes and the village has a maneapa (a community hall) in Tuvalu, which provides meeting and recreational functions as well. The isle has an oval outline, with the longer axis running east–west (about 1 km long). This island features highest point of Tuvalu ( above sea level). A fringing reef surrounds the whole island, which makes local fishing and transport into and out of the island difficult.

==Education==
Niulakita&#x27;s junior school is Lotoalofa Primary School.

<text>In computing jargon, the bit bucket (or byte bucket) is where lost computerized data has gone, by any means; any data which does not end up where it is supposed to, being lost in transmission, a computer crash, or the like, is said to have gone to the bit bucket – that mysterious place on a computer where lost data goes, as in:

==History==
Originally, the bit bucket was the container on teletype machines or IBM key punch machines into which chad from the paper tape punch or card punch was deposited; the formal name is &quot;chad box&quot; or (at IBM) &quot;chip box&quot;. The term was then generalized into any place where useless bits go, a useful computing concept known as the null device. The term bit bucket is also used in discussions of bit shift operations.

The bit bucket is related to the first in never out buffer and write-only memory, in a joke datasheet issued by Signetics in 1972.

In a 1988 April Fool&#x27;s article in &quot;Compute!&quot; magazine, Atari BASIC author Bill Wilkinson presented a POKE that implemented what he called a &quot;WORN&quot; (Write Once, Read Never) device, &quot;a close relative of the WORM&quot;.

In programming languages the term is used to denote a bitstream which does not consume any computer resources, such as CPU or memory, by discarding any data &quot;written&quot; to it. In .NET Framework-based languages, it is the &quot;System.IO.Stream.Null&quot;.

<doc id="606571" wikidata="Q4405595" url="?curid=606571" title="Infinity Gems">
<text>The Infinity Gems (originally referred to as Soul Gems and later as Infinity Stones) are six fictional gems appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, named after and embodying various aspects of existence. The gems can grant whoever wields them various powers in accordance to the aspect of existence they represent, and have the potential of turning the wielder into a god-like being when the main six (Mind, Power, Reality, Soul, Space, and Time) are held together. Thus, they are among the most powerful and sought-after items in the Marvel Universe; playing important roles in several storylines, in which they were wielded by characters such as Thanos and Adam Warlock. Some of these stories depict additional Infinity Gems or similar objects. Although, the Infinity Gems altogether give their user omnipotence, the Gems only function in the universe they belong to and not in alternate realities.

The Gems have appeared in several media adaptations outside of comics, including the Marvel Cinematic Universe film franchise, where they are called Infinity Stones and have their colors altered. These changes were later adapted into the comics.

==Publication history==

The first appearance of an Infinity Gem occurred in 1972 in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #1. It was originally called a &quot;Soul Gem&quot;. In 1976, a second &quot;Soul Gem&quot; appeared in a &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; story which established that there were six Soul Gems, each with different powers. One year later, two more &quot;Soul Gems&quot; were introduced in a Warlock crossover involving Spider-Man. The main six Gems appeared when the death-obsessed villain Thanos attempted to use them to extinguish every star in the universe. In a 1988 storyline in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3, the Elders of the Universe tried to use 6 of the &quot;Soul Gems&quot; to steal the energy of the world-eating entity Galactus.

In the 1990 limited series &quot;The Thanos Quest&quot;, Thanos refers to the entire main set as &quot;Infinity Gems&quot; for the first time. In this storyline, he steals most of the Gems for the second time and reveals the Gems to be the last remains of an omnipotent being. Thanos then places all six main gems within his left gauntlet. In the miniseries &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, Thanos uses the Gems to become nearly omnipotent and kills half the universe&#x27;s population as a gift to his love, the cosmic embodiment of Death. Although he easily repels an attack by Earth&#x27;s heroes and other cosmic entities including Eternity, the Gauntlet is eventually stolen from him by Nebula, who undoes the last 24 hours, including his mass killings. Adam Warlock then recovers the Gauntlet and, by order of the Living Tribunal, divides the Gems that fit in the gauntlet among a group he calls &quot;the Infinity Watch&quot;, consisting of himself, the superheroes Gamora, Pip the Troll, Drax the Destroyer, Moondragon, and his former adversary Thanos. The group&#x27;s adventures in defending the Gems appear in the series &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot; (1992–1995).

The 6 main Gems are next gathered by Warlock&#x27;s evil alter ego, the Magus, in the 1992 limited series &quot;The Infinity War&quot;, where he is defeated by Warlock and Earth&#x27;s heroes, including Thanos. In the 1993 limited series &quot;The Infinity Crusade&quot;, the embodiment of Warlock&#x27;s goodness, the Goddess, attempts to destroy evil in the universe by destroying free will. The 6 main Gems are then once again retrieved by the Infinity Watch.

Then, 6 of the gems appeared in the crossover between the Marvel universe and the Ultraverse, when the vampiric Rune stole the gems from the Infinity Watch. The gems were dispersed in the Ultraverse and Loki looked for them. The reunion of the gems with a seventh gem, the Ego Gem, revealed the existence of the entity Nemesis, that said that she was the conscience of the gems. Nemesis was slain and the gems dispersed again.

In a story arc of the &quot;Thanos&quot; series (2003–2004), Galactus gathers six of the Gems but accidentally allows an interdimensional entity named Hunger access to the Marvel universe. Thanos and Galactus banish the entity and the Gems are scattered again with the exception of the Soul Gem, which Thanos retains for its customary custodian Adam Warlock. In &quot;New Avengers: Illuminati&quot;, a 2007–2008 limited series, a cabal of Earth&#x27;s heroes gather the Gems and attempt to wish them out of existence but discover that they must exist as part of the cosmic balance. Instead, the Illuminati divide and hide the Gems.

In a 2010 &quot;Avengers&quot; storyline, The Hood steals several Gems but is defeated by use of the remaining Gems; the Illuminati attempt to hide them again. The Illuminati later wield the 6 main Gems to stop another universe from collapsing into their own but the cost of this however, was the destruction of the gauntlet and all gems minus the Time Gem which simply disappeared. Afterwards, the previously vanished Time Gem appears to Captain America and some of the Avengers and transports them into future realities, shattering time in the process.

As a result of the Incursions, the entire Multiverse is destroyed. However, Doctor Doom combines fragments of several alternate realities into Battleworld. Doctor Strange gathers the 6 main Infinity Gems from various realities into a new Infinity Gauntlet, which he leaves hidden until the surviving heroes of Earth-616 return. The Gauntlet is subsequently claimed by Black Panther, who uses it to keep the Beyonder-enhanced Doom occupied until Mister Fantastic can disrupt his power source.

Following the recreation of the Multiverse, the Infinity Gems (now known as the Infinity Stones) are recreated and scattered across the universe, with their colors switched and some taking on uncut ingot forms. In &quot;Marvel Legacy&quot; #1, the Space Stone (now colored blue) appears on Earth where a Frost Giant working for Loki steals it from a S.H.I.E.L.D. storage facility, however he is intercepted and defeated by a resurrected Wolverine. Star-Lord discovers an extra-large Power Stone (now colored purple) being protected by the Nova Corps, and an alternate universe Peter Quill named Starkill has the Reality Stone (now colored red). A future version of Ghost Rider is revealed to possess a shard of the Time Stone (now colored green), while in the present the complete stone restores the ruined planet of Sakaar and is claimed by the Super-Skrull. The Mind Stone (now colored yellow) is found on Earth in the hands of petty crook Turk Barrett, and the Soul Stone (now colored orange) is mentioned to Adam Warlock to be in the hands of his dark aspect, the Magus; however, Ultron is able to claim it after ambushing and killing him. The Stones are shown to have a pocket universe existing within each of them. Loki would later discover the Stones are originated from the primordial universe where Celestials reside, guarding a deposit of countless Infinity Stones which they infuse with their cosmic energy and deliver to different realities across the Multiverse. Warlock later uses the Soul Stone to grant the other Stones sentience and enable them to choose their own wielders.

Recently, Thanos trapped the cosmic entity known as Death inside a new Infinity Stone, creating the Death Stone. This Stone, like the others, quickly chose a host, resurrecting Phil Coulson and bonding with him.

==Description==

Each Gem is shaped like a small oval and is named after, and represents, a different characteristic of existence. Possessing any single Gem grants control over the aspect of existence the Gem represents. If a user is able to tap into the full potential of a Gem, the user gains complete control over a Gem&#x27;s aspect of existence. The Gems are not immutable. For instance, on two occasions, one or more of the Gems have appeared as pink spheres several feet in diameter, while on other occasions, the Gems have appeared in their small oval shape but with different coloring. (e.g. the Soul Gem being colored red when worn by the Gardener). In the Ultraverse, after merging into their original form of Nemesis, the Gems were again separated after a battle with Ultraforce and the Avengers. As part of the &quot;Marvel Legacy&quot; initiative, the six Infinity Gems now known as the Infinity Stones and have their colors altered to match the Infinity Stones from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Thanos created an additional gem, the Death Stone, after imprisoning Death within it.

The seven Infinity Stones include:

Additional Gems have appeared in crossover media and alternate universes outside the Marvel Universe.

==Other versions==
===Council of Reeds===
The Reed Richards of Earth-616, in an attempt to &quot;solve everything&quot;, meets with a council of alternate universe Reeds. Three of them wear Infinity Gauntlets, and they learn that the gauntlets only work in their respective universes of origin.

===&quot;Contest of Champions&quot;===
In the &quot;Contest of Champions&quot; miniseries, an alternate version of Tony Stark uses the Reality Gem to win the superhero civil war and affect the outcome of a presidential election. When he tries to use the Gem on Battleworld, he is killed by the Maestro, who says the Gems do not work in any universe other than their own.

===&quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; (2021)===
In an alternate reality depicted in the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; miniseries, the Infinity Gems are in the possession of Thanos, who has them placed in his Infinity Rings.

===&quot;New Avengers&quot;===
During the &quot;Incursion&quot; storyline, the Avengers travel to a parallel Earth where a pastiche of the Justice League have replaced this Earth&#x27;s Avengers who all died in a previous cataclysm. Here the Gems are all square planes of &quot;forever glass&quot; which are assembled into the &quot;Wishing Cube&quot;, a composite of the concepts of the Infinity Gems and the Cosmic Cube.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot;===
After various alternate universes are combined into Battleworld, Doctor Strange gathers Infinity Gems from other universes into a new Infinity Gauntlet that works in the area where Doom has built his palace. Strange leaves the Gauntlet hidden until he has access to someone he can trust it with. After his death, the Gauntlet is claimed by T&#x27;Challa, who uses it against Doom in the final battle.

A separate section of Battleworld known as New Xandar also has a Gauntlet fought over by multiple factions until the majority of the Stones, except the Reality Stone, were taken by Thanos. Thanos eventually tracks the missing Stone to Nova Corps member Anwen Bakian. When Thanos confronts her to get the Stone, Anwen gives him a duplicate of the Reality Stone she created called the &#x27;Death Stone&#x27;. When used along with the other five Stones, the Death Stone corrupts Thanos with black matter and turns him to dust.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; universe, an Infinity Gauntlet is seen in Project Pegasus. The Mind Gem (stolen by Hydra) is used by Modi (Thor&#x27;s son) to control both Director Flumm and Cassie Lang, but are stopped by the Ultimates. The Power Gem is later revealed to be in the possession of former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sayuri Kyota, while a second Infinity Gauntlet is recovered from an A.I.M. base by Thor and Susan Storm. Kang the Conqueror later allies himself with the Hulk, Reed Richards and Quicksilver as part of a plan to steal the two Gauntlets, which results in the destruction of the Triskelion. Quicksilver recovers two additional Gems allowing the villains to teleport away. Richards is later able to recover another of the Gems, which is found lodged in Tony Stark&#x27;s brain. He informs Stark that the Infinity Gems are needed to save the world from a coming cataclysm that will destroy the entire universe. After brainwashing Johnny Storm and forcing him to travel to the Earth&#x27;s core, the Dark Ultimates are able to recover the final gem, but are defeated by the Ultimates. The gems then shatter, rendering the Gauntlets useless.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
In a reality where Doctor Doom retained the power of the Beyonder, Doom acquired the Infinity Gems from the Elders of the Universe and used them to defeat the Celestials in a 407-year-long war before finally forsaking his power.

In an alternate reality where the original Fantastic Four died, a new Fantastic Four – consisting of Spider-Man, Hulk, Wolverine, and Ghost Rider – was formed. With Iron Man replacing Ghost Rider, they were the only heroes available to fight Thanos when he initially assembled the Infinity Gauntlet. Despite Iron Man&#x27;s use of Negative Zone-enhanced Celestial armor, Thanos still easily defeated the team until Wolverine tricked Thanos into erasing Mephisto from existence before cutting off Thanos&#x27;s left arm, and therefore the Infinity Gauntlet. With Thanos powerless, Spider-Man used the gauntlet to undo the events of Thanos&#x27;s godhood.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Infinity Gauntlet, Infinity Gems, and an original weapon called the &quot;Infinity Sword&quot; appear in &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot;. After Iron Man and Doctor Doom destroy the Infinity Sword while attempting to claim it, the first season of the series sees the titular squad collecting the sword&#x27;s fragments, or &quot;Infinity Fractals&quot;, before Doctor Doom&#x27;s Lethal Legion can. While Doom rebuilds the Infinity Sword, the Silver Surfer tells him that it is useless without the Infinity Gauntlet before taking the sword out to space. The second season sees Thanos attempting to collect the Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet until the Silver Surfer, corrupted into the Dark Surfer by the sword, steals the completed gauntlet from him. After the Super Hero Squad defeat the Dark Surfer, the gems and sword are destroyed, sending Infinity Fractals across the universe.
* The Infinity Gauntlet and five of the Infinity Stones appear in &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;. This version of the Infinity Gauntlet has slots for five of the stones as the Soul Stone was in Adam Warlock&#x27;s possession and Thanos feared him.
* The Soul Stone appears in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;.
* The Power Stone appears in the &quot;Marvel Future Avengers&quot; episode &quot;Mission Black Market Auction&quot;. This version was originally kept within Asgard before it was stolen and taken to a black market on Earth.

In the game&#x27;s story, Ultron and Sigma use the Space and Reality Stones to fuse themselves into Ultron Sigma and merge the Marvel and Capcom universes into one under their control, leading to the heroes of both universes joining forces to retrieve the remaining Infinity Stones before Ultron Sigma. While Thanos unknowingly cracks the Reality Stone while fighting Ultron Sigma, X destroys the hybrid villain before the heroes build a new society.
* The Infinity Stones and a suit of &quot;Infinity Armor&quot;, of which the Infinity Gauntlet is a part of, appear in &quot;Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3: The Black Order&quot;.

<text>When speaking of 1550s architecture there are many things to consider. Some may think of specific leaders, towns, or events that influenced the buildings around them. Others may immediately go to the buildings or architects or even thriving towns at the time. There is so much history from the time period lets get into some of the details...

== Renaissance Architecture ==

The 1550s were filled with buildings from the Renaissance period. One example of this was Andrea Palladio Villa Rotonda. Although the building was complete in the 1590s, the design began in the 1550s. You can see the symmetry, proportion, and use of classical order. The building resides just outside of the city Vicenza in Italy. Palladio later published his pieces, &quot;Four Books of Architecture.&quot; While Palladio didn&#x27;t have the sketches when construction began, he drew them up for the intended design of the completed building to include when published. Since his publishing, there has been many recreations of his sketches and even buildings around the world. Giovanni Dominico Giaconi later redid his sketches in watercolor.

== Influences to Architecture ==
One many specifically sticks out, as an influence to High Renaissance and the Mannerism period is Michelangelo. He created pieces of art that inspired architects of his time to expand their horizon out of their comfort zone. This brought out a whole new decorative side to the classical architecture as seen before. 

Sebastiano Serlio wrote his &quot;Seven Books on Architecture&quot; that would impact the entire architecture community from then on. The six books consisted of advice to future architects of and surveyed buildings. The seventh and eighth volumes were added at later dates following the rage of the original six. 

==Births==
* 1550: April 18 – Alessandro Pieroni, Italian mannerist painter and architect (died 1607)
* c.1550 – Vittorio Cassar, Maltese architect (died c.1607)
* 1556 – Carlo Maderno, Ticinese-born baroque architect (died 1629)

==Deaths==
* 1554 – Sebastiano Serlio, Wrote the &quot;Seven Books on Architecture&quot; (born 1475)
* 1564 - Michelangelo, Popular painter at the time, influenced many architects to expand their creativity (born 1475)

<doc id="606577" wikidata="Q6412197" url="?curid=606577" title="King of Albania">
<text>While the medieval AngevinKingdom of Albania was a monarchy, it did not encompass the entirety of modern Albania. Although discontent among Albanian nobles emerged by 1282 due to the Angevin king&#x27;s unfulfilled promises, the kingdom did not end at that time. Instead, Albanian nobles sought the support of the Roman Emperor in Constantinople, but Angevin rule continued in the region for several more decades. During the Middle Ages there have been many different Albanian nobles who called themselves ruler of Albania, including Dhimitër Progoni (&quot;Prince of the Albanians &amp; Prince of Albania&quot;), Andrea II Muzaka (&quot;Despot of Albania&quot;), Karl Thopia (&quot;Prince of Albania&quot;), and Skanderbeg (&quot;Lord of Albania&quot;).

The modern Albania has been a kingdom on two occasions.

The first occasion was after the Albanian Declaration of Independence in 1912, though a monarch was not chosen until 1914. Prince Wilhelm of Wied assumed the throne but was forced into exile later that year as World War I led to the occupation of Albania. The country remained politically unstable until the establishment of the Albanian Republic in 1924.

The second instance began in 1928, when President Ahmet Zogu declared himself King Zog I. However, the continuity of the monarchy was disrupted by World War II. Albania was occupied by Italy from 1939 to 1943 and later by Nazi Germany until 1944. Following a civil war, the monarchy was formally abolished in 1946 with the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of Albania.

After the fall of communism in 1992, Albania became a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic. Although the monarchy was never restored, hereditary pretenders to the title &quot;King of the Albanians&quot; continue to exist.

==History ==
The Albanian Congress of Trieste of 1913 discussed the question of the future prince and several candidates came through: Baron Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás, Marchese D&#x27;Auletta (claiming descendance from Skanderbeg) with the support of the Arbereshe delegates and Italy, Prince Albert Ghica from Romania supported by the Albanian colony there, and Aladro Kastriota.

Under the independence settlement imposed by the Great Powers, the country was styled a principality, and its ruler, William of Wied (), was titled prince. However, these styles were only used outside the country. In Albanian, William was referred to as , meaning king. This was because many local nobles already had the title of prince (, , or in various Albanian dialects), and because domestically the Albanian sovereign could not be seen as holding a title inferior to that of the king of Montenegro. Prince William&#x27;s full style was: &quot;By the grace of the powers and the will of the people the prince of Albania&quot;.

William was forced into exile by internal disorder just after the outbreak of World War I, and Albania was to be occupied by various foreign powers for most of the war. In the confusing aftermath of the war, some of the several regimes competing for power officially styled themselves as regencies for William. Albania&#x27;s first monarchy ended definitively when the restored central government declared the country a republic in 1924.

Four years later, on September 1, 1928, President Ahmed Bey Zogu proclaimed himself &quot;king of the Albanians&quot; ( in Albanian). Zog sought to establish a constitutional monarchy. Under the royal constitution, the Albanian king, like the king of the Belgians, had to swear an oath before parliament before entering into his royal powers. The text of the oath was as follows:

Zog&#x27;s kingdom was closely tied to Italy, then ruled by Victor Emmanuel III. On April 7, 1939, Italy occupied Albania, treating it as the Italian protectorate of Albania. Zog fled the country, though he never abdicated, and five days later the Albanian Parliament proclaimed Victor Emmanuel as the new King of the Albanians. When the Italian Armed Forces started being decimated in 1943, Victor Emmanuel signed the Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies on 3 September 1943, which included his abdication as the Albanian monarch and the end of the so-called protectorate. While Zog I was reinstated as king (in absentia) by pro-monarchy partisans, this action was opposed by pro-communist partisans, all made moot as Nazi Germany immediately commenced the German occupation of Albania. The Germans were pushed out by late 1944, by which point the partisan factions were basically fighting a civil war. This continued until the socialist People&#x27;s Republic of Albania was established in 1946.

During and after World War II, some Albanians worked for the return of King Zog; however, they were not successful. Neither Zog nor Victor Emmanuel had the Albanian royal title widely acknowledged by the international community. Zog&#x27;s son, Crown Prince Leka (1939–2011), was the main pretender to the Albanian Crown. As he himself stated, his title was not &quot;king of Albania&quot; but &quot;king of the Albanians&quot;, which included a claim to Kosovo and part of today&#x27;s North Macedonia. Since Crown Prince Leka&#x27;s death in late November, 2011, the main pretender to the Albanian Throne is his son Leka II.

<text>Paragraph 175, known formally as §175 StGB and also referred to as Section 175 in English, was a provision of the German Criminal Code from 15 May 1871 to 10 March 1994. It made sexual relations between males a crime, and in early revisions the provision also criminalized bestiality as well as forms of prostitution and underage sexual abuse. Overall, around 140,000 men were convicted under the law. The law had always been controversial and inspired the first homosexual movement, which called for its repeal.

The statute drew legal influence from previous measures, including those undertaken by the Holy Roman Empire and Prussian states. It was amended several times. The Nazis broadened the law in 1935 as part of the most severe persecution of homosexual men in history. It was one of the few Nazi-era laws to be retained in their original form in West Germany, although East Germany reverted to the pre-Nazi version. In 1987, the law was ruled unconstitutional in East Germany, and it was repealed there in 1989. In West Germany, the law was revised in 1969, whereby the criminal liability of homosexual adults (then aged 21 and over) was abolished but remained applicable to sex with a man less than 21 years old, homosexual prostitution, and the exploitation of a relationship of dependency. The law was again revised in 1973 by lowering the age of consent to 18 years, and it was finally repealed in 1994.

==Historical overview==
Paragraph 175 was adopted in 1871, shortly after Germany was unified. Beginning in the 1890s, sexual reformers fought against the &quot;disgraceful paragraph&quot;, and soon won the support of August Bebel, head of the Social Democratic Party (SPD); however, a petition in the Reichstag to abolish Paragraph 175 foundered in 1898. In 1907, a Reichstag Committee decided to broaden the paragraph to make lesbian sexual acts punishable as well, but debates about how to define female sexuality meant the proposal languished and was abandoned. In 1929, another Reichstag Committee decided to repeal Paragraph 175 with the votes of the Social Democrats, the Communist Party (KPD) and the German Democratic Party (DDP); however, the rise of the Nazi Party prevented the implementation of the repeal. Although modified at various times, the paragraph remained part of German law until 1994.

In 1935, the Nazis broadened the law so that the courts could pursue any &quot;lewd act&quot; whatsoever, even one involving no physical contact, such as masturbating next to each other. Convictions multiplied by a factor of ten to over 8,000 per year by 1937. Furthermore, the Gestapo could transport suspected offenders to concentration camps without any legal justification at all (even if they had been acquitted or already served their sentence in jail). Thus, over 10,000 homosexual men were forced into concentration camps, where they were identified by the pink triangle. The majority of them died there.

While the Nazi persecution of homosexuals is reasonably well known today, far less attention has been given to the continuation of this persecution in post-war Germany. In 1945, after the concentration camps were liberated, some homosexual prisoners were recalled to custody to serve out their two-year sentence under Paragraph 175. In 1950, East Germany abolished Nazi amendments to Paragraph 175, whereas West Germany kept them and even had them confirmed by its Constitutional Court. About 100,000 men were implicated in legal proceedings from 1945 to 1969, and about 50,000 were convicted. Some individuals accused under Paragraph 175 committed suicide. In 1969, the government eased Paragraph 175 by providing for an age of consent of 21. The age of consent was lowered to 18 in 1973, and finally, in 1994, the paragraph was repealed and the age of consent lowered to 16, the same that is in force for heterosexual acts. East Germany had already reformed its more lenient version of the paragraph in 1968, and repealed it in 1988.
==Background==

Most sodomy-related laws in Western civilization originated from the growth of Christianity during Late Antiquity. Germany is notable for having anti-sodomy regulation before Christianity; Roman historian Tacitus records execution of homosexuals in his book &quot;Germania&quot;. Christian condemnation of homosexuality reinforced these sentiments as Germany became baptised. In 1532, the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina produced a foundation for this principle of law, which remained valid in the Holy Roman Empire until the end of the 18th century. In the words of Paragraph 116 of that code:

The punishment for fornication that goes against nature. When a human commits fornication with a beast, a man with a man, a woman with a woman, they have also forfeited life. And they should be, according to the common custom, banished by fire from life into death.

In 1794, Prussia introduced the &quot;Allgemeines Landrecht&quot;, a major reform of laws that replaced the death penalty for this offense with a term of imprisonment. Paragraph 143 of that code says:

Unnatural fornication, whether between persons of the male sex or of humans with beasts, is punished with imprisonment of six months to four years, with the further punishment of a prompt loss of civil rights.

In France, the Revolutionary Penal Code of 1791 punished acts of this nature only when someone&#x27;s rights were injured (i.e., in the case of a non-consensual act), which had the effect of the complete legalization of homosexuality. In the course of his conquests, Napoleon exported the French Penal Code beyond France into a sequence of other states such as the Netherlands. The Rhineland and later Bavaria adopted the French model and removed from their lawbooks all prohibitions of consensual sexual acts.

The 1851 Prussian criminal code justified the criminalization of homosexuality with reference to Christian morality, even though the prohibited act did not endanger any legal interest. Two years before the 1871 founding of the German Empire, the Prussian kingdom, worried over the future of the paragraph, sought a scientific basis for this piece of legislation. The Ministry of Justice assigned a &quot;Deputation für das Medizinalwesen&quot; (&quot;Deputation for Medical Knowledge&quot;), including among others the famous physicians Rudolf Virchow and Heinrich Adolf von Bardeleben, who stated in their appraisal of 24 March 1869 that they were unable to give a scientific grounding for a law that outlawed zoophilia and male homosexual intercourse, distinguishing them from the many other sexual acts that were not even considered as matters of penal law. Nevertheless, the draft penal law submitted by Otto von Bismarck in 1870 to the North German Confederation retained the relevant Prussian penal provisions, justifying this out of concern for &quot;public opinion&quot;.

==German Empire==

On 1 January 1872, exactly one year after it had first taken effect, the penal code of the North German Confederation became the penal code of the entire German Empire. By this change, sexual intercourse between men became again a punishable offence in Bavaria as well. Almost verbatim from its Prussian model from 1794, the new Paragraph 175 of the imperial penal code specified:

Unnatural fornication, whether between persons of the male sex or of humans with beasts, is punished with imprisonment, with the further punishment of a prompt loss of civil rights.

Even in the 1860s, individuals such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs and Karl Maria Kertbeny had unsuccessfully raised their voices against the Prussian paragraph 143. In the Empire, more organized opposition began with the 1897 founding of the sexual-reformist Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee (WhK, Scientific-Humanitarian Committee), an organization of notables rather than a mass movement, which tried to proceed against Paragraph 175 based on the thesis of the innate nature of homosexuality.

This case was argued, for example, in an 1897 petition drafted by physician and WhK chairman Magnus Hirschfeld, urging the deletion of Paragraph 175; it gathered 6,000 signatories. One year later, SPD chairman August Bebel brought the petition into the Reichstag, but failed to achieve the desired effect. On the contrary, ten years later the government laid plans to extend Paragraph 175 to women as well. Part of their &quot;Scheme for a German Penal Code&quot; (E 1909) reads:

The danger to family life and to youth is the same. The fact that there are more such cases in recent times is reliably testified. It lies therefore in the interest of morality as in that of the general welfare that penal provisions be expanded also to women.

Allowing time for the refinement of the draft, it was set to appear before the Reichstag no earlier than 1917. World War I and the defeat of the German Empire consigned it to the dustbin.

==Weimar Republic==

There was a vigorous grassroots campaign against Paragraph 175 between 1919 and 1929, led by an alliance of the &quot;Gemeinschaft der Eigenen&quot; and the &quot;Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee&quot;. But, much as during the time of the Empire, during the Weimar Republic the parties of the left failed to achieve the abolition of Paragraph 175, because they lacked a majority in the Reichstag.

The plans of a center-right regime in 1925 to increase the penalties of Paragraph 175 came closer to fruition; but they, too, failed. In addition to paragraph 296 (which corresponded to the old paragraph 175), their proposed reform draft provided for a paragraph 297 to be included. The plan was that so-called &quot;qualified cases&quot; such as homosexual prostitution, sex with young men under the age of 21, and sexual coercion of a man in a service or work situation would be classified as &quot;severe cases&quot;, reclassified as felonies (&quot;Verbrechen&quot;) rather than misdemeanors (&quot;Vergehen&quot;). This act would have pertained not only to homosexual intercourse but also to other homosexual acts such as, for example, mutual masturbation.

Both new paragraphs grounded themselves in protection of public health:

It is to be assumed that it is the German view that sexual relationships between men are an aberration liable to wreck the character and to destroy moral feeling. Clinging to this aberration leads to the degeneration of the people and to the decay of its strength.

When this draft was discussed in 1929 by the judiciary committee of the Reichstag, the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, and the left-wing liberal German Democratic Party at first managed to mobilize a majority of 15 to 13 votes against Paragraph 296. This would have constituted legalization of consensual homosexuality between adult men. At the same time, a vast majoritywith only three KPD votes dissentingsupported the introduction of the new Paragraph 297 (dealing with the so-called &quot;qualified cases&quot;).

However, this partial successwhich the WhK characterized as &quot;one step forward and two steps back&quot;came to nought. In March 1930, the &quot;Inter-Parliamentary Committee for the Coordination of Criminal Law Between Germany and Austria&quot;, by a vote of 23 to 21, placed back Paragraph 296 in the reform package. But the latter was never passed, because during the last years of the Weimar Republic, the years of the &quot;Präsidialkabinette&quot;, the parliamentary legislative process generally ground to a halt.

==The Nazi era==
In 1935, the Nazis strengthened Paragraph 175 by redefining the crime as a felony and thus increasing the maximum penalty from six months&#x27; to five years&#x27; imprisonment. Further, they removed the longtime tradition that the law applied only to &#x27;intercourse-like&#x27; acts (meaning the police could not prosecute unless substantial proof of intercourse was given). A criminal offense would now exist if &quot;objectively the general sense of shame was offended&quot; and subjectively &quot;the debauched intention was present to excite sexual desire in one of the two men, or a third&quot;. Mutual physical contact was no longer necessary. This formulation was fundamentally different from traditional sodomy laws, but similar to the law against gross indecency in the United Kingdom since 1885.

Beyond thatmuch as had already been planned in 1925a new Paragraph 175a was created, punishing &quot;qualified cases&quot; as &quot;schwere Unzucht&quot; (&quot;severe lewdness&quot;) with no less than one year and no more than ten years in the penitentiary. These included:
* homosexual acts forced through violence or threats (male rape),
* sexual relations with a subordinate or employee in a work situation,
* homosexual acts with men under the age of 21,
* male prostitution.
&quot;Unnatural fornication with a beast&quot; was moved to Paragraph 175b (this section applied to both men and women).

According to the official rationale, Paragraph 175 was amended in the interest of the moral health of the &quot;Volk&quot;the German peoplebecause &quot;according to experience&quot; homosexuality &quot;inclines toward plague-like propagation&quot; and exerts &quot;a ruinous influence&quot; on the &quot;circles concerned&quot;.
This aggravation of the severity of Paragraph 175 in 1935 increased the number of convictions tenfold, to 8,000 annually. Only about half of the prosecutions resulted from police work; about 40 percent resulted from private accusations (&quot;Strafanzeige&quot;) by non-participating observers, and about 10 percent were denouncements by employers and institutions. So, for example, in 1938 the Gestapo received the following anonymous letter:

Wea large part of the artists&#x27; block [of flats or studios] at Barnaywegask you urgently to observe B., living with Mrs. F as a subtenant, who has remarkable daily visits from young men. This must not continue. [...] We ask you cordially to give the matter further observation.

In contradistinction to normal police, the &quot;Gestapo&quot; were authorized to take gay men into preventive detention (&quot;Schutzhaft&quot;) of arbitrary duration without an accusation (or even after an acquittal). This was often the fate of so-called &quot;repeat offenders&quot;: at the end of their sentences, they were not freed but sent for additional &quot;re-education&quot; (&quot;Umerziehung&quot;) in a concentration camp. Only about 40 percent of these pink triangle prisonerswhose numbers amounted to an estimated 10,000survived the camps. Some of them, after their release by the Allied Forces, were placed back in prison, because they had not yet finished court-mandated terms of imprisonment for homosexual acts.

==After World War II==

===Development in the Soviet occupation zone and in East Germany===
In the Soviet occupation zone that later became East Germany, the development of law was not uniform. The Provincial High Court in Halle (&quot;Oberlandesgericht Halle, or OLG Halle&quot;) decided for Saxony-Anhalt in 1948 that Paragraphs 175 and 175a were to be seen as injustice perpetrated by the Nazis, because a progressive juridical development had been broken off and even been reversed. Homosexual acts were to be tried only according to the laws of the Weimar Republic.

In 1950, one year after being reconstituted as the German Democratic Republic, the Berlin Appeal Court (&quot;Kammergericht Berlin&quot;) decided for all of East Germany to reinstate the validity of the old, pre-1935 form of Paragraph 175. However, in contrast to the earlier action of the OLG Halle, the new Paragraph 175a remained unchanged, because it was said to protect society against &quot;socially harmful homosexual acts of qualified character&quot;. In 1954, the same court decided that Paragraph 175a, in contrast to Paragraph 175, did not presuppose acts tantamount to sexual intercourse. Lewdness (&quot;Unzucht&quot;) was defined as any act that is performed to arouse sexual excitement and &quot;violates the moral sentiment of our workers&quot;.

A revision of the criminal code in 1957 made it possible to put aside prosecution of an illegal action that represented no danger to socialist society because of lack of consequence. This removed Paragraph 175 from the effective body of the law, because at the same time the East Berlin Court of Appeal (&quot;Kammergericht&quot;) decided that all punishments deriving from the old form of Paragraph 175 should be suspended due to the insignificance of the acts to which it had been applied. On this basis, homosexual acts between consenting adults ceased to be punished, beginning in the late 1950s.

On 1 July 1968, the GDR adopted its own code of criminal law. In it § 151 StGB-DDR provided for a sentence up to three years&#x27; imprisonment or probation for an adult (18 and over) who engaged in sexual acts with a youth (under 18) of the same sex. This law applied not only to men who have sex with boys but equally to women who have sex with girls.

On 11 August 1987, the Supreme Court of the GDR struck down a conviction under Paragraph 151 on the basis that &quot;homosexuality, just like heterosexuality, represents a variant of sexual behavior. Homosexual people do therefore not stand outside socialist society, and the civil rights are warranted to them exactly as to all other citizens.&quot; One year later, the Volkskammer (the parliament of the GDR), in its fifth revision of the criminal code, brought the written law in line with what the court had ruled, striking Paragraph 151 without replacement. The act passed into law May 30, 1989. This removed all specific reference to homosexuality from East German criminal law.

===Development in West Germany===
After World War II, the victorious Allies demanded the abolition of all laws with specifically National Socialist content; however, they left it to West Germany to decide whether or not the expansion of laws regulating male homosexual relationships falling under Paragraph 175 should be left in place. On May 10, 1957, the Federal Constitutional Court upheld the decision to retain the 1935 version, claiming that the paragraph was &quot;not influenced by National Socialist [i.e., Nazi] politics to such a degree that it would have to be abolished in a free democratic state&quot;.

Between 1945 and 1969, about 100,000 men were indicted and about 50,000 men sentenced to prison. The rate of convictions for violation of Paragraph 175 rose by 44 percent, and in the 1960s, the number remained as much as four times higher than it had been in the last years of the Weimar Republic. Many arrests, lawsuits, and proceedings in Frankfurt in 1950–1951 had serious consequences. These Frankfurt Homosexual Trials of 1950/51 marked an early climax in the persecution of homosexual men in the Federal Republic of Germany, which showed clear continuities from the Nazi era, but took place under the auspices of the new Adenauer era. They were largely initiated by the Frankfurt public prosecutor&#x27;s office, using the sex worker Otto Blankenstein as a key witness.

The strong continuities between the Nazi era and postwar West Germany are partly due to the continuity in staffing of the police and judiciary, which was disrupted in East Germany. The retention of the Nazis&#x27; legal basis for the charges, however, was due to a conservative Christian political realignment; criminalization was strongly defended by some CDU/CSU politicians such as Franz-Josef Wuermeling and Adolf Süsterhenn. These &quot;Catholic maximalists&quot; faced increasing opposition from Protestants and the more liberal elements within their own party. Similar to the thinking during the Nazi Regime, the government argued that there was a difference between a homosexual man and a homosexual woman, and that because all men were assumed to be more aggressive and predatory than women, lesbianism would not be criminalized. Therefore, it was argued, while lesbianism violated nature, it did not present the same threat to society as did male homosexuality.

First convening in 1954, the legal experts in the criminal code commission (Strafrechtskommission) continued to debate the future of Paragraph 175; while the constitutional court ruled it was not unconstitutional, this did not mean it should forever remain in force. It was therefore the commission&#x27;s job to advise the Ministry of Justice and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer about the new form this law should take. While they all agreed homosexual activity was immoral, they were divided when it came to whether or not it should be allowed to be practiced between consenting adults in private. Due to their belief that homosexuals were not born that way, but rather, they fell victim to seduction, the Justice Ministry officials remained concerned that if freed from criminal penalty, adult homosexuals would intensify their &quot;propaganda and activity in public&quot; and put male youth at risk.
During the administration of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s government, a draft penal code for West Germany (known as &quot;Strafgesetzbuch E 1962&quot;; it was never adopted) justified retaining paragraph 175 as follows:

Concerning male homosexuality, the legal system must, more than in other areas, erect a bulwark against the spreading of this vice, which otherwise would represent a serious danger for a healthy and natural life of the people.

With new national Bundestag (West Germany&#x27;s parliament) elections coming up, the Social Democratic Party was coming into power, first in 1966 as part of a broad coalition, and by 1969, with a parliamentary majority. With the Social Democrats holding the power, they were finally in a position to make key appointments in the Ministry of Justice and start implementing reform. In addition, demographic anxieties such as fear of declining birth rate no longer controlled the 1960s and homosexual men were no longer seen as a threat for not being able to reproduce. The role of the state was seen as protecting society from harm, and should only intervene in cases that involved force or the abuse of minors.

On 25 June 1969, shortly before the end of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU)SPD Grand Coalition headed by CDU Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger, Paragraph 175 was reformed, in that only the &quot;qualified cases&quot; that were previously handled in §175asex with a man less than 21 years old, homosexual prostitution, and the exploitation of a relationship of dependency (such as employing or supervising a person in a work situation)were retained. Paragraph 175b (concerning bestiality) also was removed. Three days later, on June 28, 1969, the Stonewall riots broke out in New York.

With the 1969 reform in place, the acceptance of homosexual acts or homosexual identities for West Germans was far from in place. Most reformers agreed that decriminalizing sexual relations between adult men was not the same as advocating an acceptance of homosexual men. While the old view of &quot;militarized&quot; masculinity may have phased out, &quot;family-centered&quot; masculinity was now grounded in the traditional male, and being a proper man meant being a proper father, which was believed at the time to be a role a homosexual male could not fulfill.

On 23 November 1973, the social-liberal coalition of the SPD and the Free Democratic Party passed a complete reform of the laws concerning sex and sexuality. The paragraph was renamed from &quot;Crimes and misdemeanors against morality&quot; into &quot;Offenses against sexual self-determination&quot;, and the word &quot;Unzucht&quot; (&quot;lewdness&quot;) was replaced by the equivalent of the term &quot;sexual acts&quot;. Paragraph 175 only retained sex with minors as a qualifying attribute; the age of consent was lowered to 18 (compared to 14 for heterosexual sex).

In 1986 the Green Party and the first openly gay member of the German parliament tried to remove Paragraph 175 together with Paragraph 182. This would have meant a general age of consent of 14 years. This was opposed by the CDU, SPD, and FDP, and Paragraph 175 remained a part of German law for eight more years.

==Developments after 1990==

===Deletion of Paragraph 175===
 In the course of reconciling the legal codes of the two German states after 1990, the Bundestag had to decide whether Paragraph 175 should be abolished entirely (as in the former East Germany) or whether the remaining West German form of the law should be extended to what had now become the eastern portion of the Federal Republic. In 1994, at the end of the period of reconciliation of laws, it was decidedespecially in view of the social changes that had occurred in the meantimeto strike Paragraph 175 entirely from the legal code. Paragraph 175 was repealed on 10 March 1994.

According to § 176 StGB the absolute minimum age of consent is now 14 years for all sexual acts irrespective of the sex of the participants; in special cases, covered in § 182 StGB, an age of 16 years applies. § 182 (2) StGB allows for prosecution as an &quot;Antragsdelikt&quot;, a concept in German law according to which certain acts are treated as crimes only if the victim chooses to become a complainant. Further, § 182 (3) StGB allows the public prosecutor&#x27;s office to pursue a case on the basis of the belief that there is a special public interest. Finally, § 182 (4) StGB allows the court to refrain from punishment if the wrongness of the accused&#x27;s behavior appears small.

§ 182 StGB contains numerous terms without precise legal definitions; critics have raised concerns that families can misuse this law to criminalize socially disapproved sexual relationships (e.g. a family disapproving of a young person&#x27;s homosexual relationship might be able to prosecute their partner).

In Austria, an analogous situation exists: Like the German § 175 StGB, the Austrian § 209 StGB was stricken from the legal code; like the German § 182 StGB, the Austrian § 207b StGB is perceived by critics as having potential to be abused as a surrogate for the stricken law.

===Pardon of the victims===
On 17 May 2002a date chosen symbolically as &quot;17.5&quot;the Bundestag passed a supplement to the &quot;NS-Aufhebungsgesetz&quot; (). By this supplement to the act, Nazi-era convictions of homosexuals and deserters from the Wehrmacht were annulled. Louder criticism came from the lesbian and gay movement, because the Bundestag left post-1945 judgments untouched, although the legal basis from the end of the war to 1969 was the same as in the Nazi era.

The issue of pardoning men convicted in the postwar era remained controversial. On 12 May 2016, Federal Minister of Justice, Heiko Maas, announced that Germany was investigating the possibility of pardoning and compensating all gay men convicted under Paragraph 175. In cases where victims had died still bearing a conviction, the government will instead make payments to gay rights groups. This was confirmed on 8 October 2016, when Maas laid out the compensation scheme and announced that the government was setting aside €30 million to cover claims. The law comprises both individual pardons and a collective pardon and the documenting of suffering caused by the law, with the full process expected to take up to five years. Those affected by the pardon can apply for a &quot;vindication certificate&quot;, and relatives can apply for a posthumous pardon. Each person convicted will receive €3,000 compensation, plus €1,500 for each year spent in custody as a result of a conviction under Paragraph 175 – on average, a conviction carried a two-year sentence. Bundestag member Volker Beck, who was a key figure in establishing a compensation fund for victims of Nazism, suggested that other losses suffered as a result of conviction under Paragraph 175, such as the loss of a job and resulting reduction in pension, should also be taken into account when deciding how much compensation to offer. In June 2017, the law was passed in the Bundestag by an overwhelming majority in all parties.

<text>The Tri-City ValleyCats (colloquially known as the ‘Cats) are a professional baseball team based in Troy, New York. The ValleyCats compete in the Frontier League (FL) as a member of the North Division in the Atlantic Conference, and play their home games at Joseph L. Bruno Stadium.

From 2002 to 2020, they were members of Minor League Baseball&#x27;s New York–Penn League (NYPL) as the Class A Short Season affiliate of the Houston Astros. With MLB&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, the ValleyCats were not selected to continue in affiliated baseball. They joined the independent Frontier League for the 2021 season, which was designated as an MLB Partner League that year.

==Team history==
===Before Tri-City===
Prior to their arrival in Troy, the club was based first in Little Falls, New York, as the Little Falls Mets (1977–1988), and then in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, as the Pittsfield Mets (1989–2000) and Pittsfield Astros (2001).

===2002 season===
The ValleyCats played their first game on the road in Lowell, Massachusetts, on June 18, 2002, against their rival the Lowell Spinners. The Spinners had a 3–1 lead going into the eighth inning, but a triple by Aneudi Cuevas down the right field line drove in three runs leading the ValleyCats to a 5–4 victory.

===2006 season===
In their 2006 season, the ValleyCats registered an attendance of 129,126 in 37 contests, averaging 3,489 fans per game. On July 4, 2006, the ValleyCats set a new all-time home attendance mark as 6,123 people attended a game against the Lowell Spinners which was later broken in the following years.

===2008 season===
====All-Star game====
The Valley Cats hosted the fourth annual New York–Penn League All-Star Game at Joseph L. Bruno Stadium in 2008. The game was played between teams made up of the affiliates of National League (NL) and American League (AL) teams. The ValleyCats, affiliates of the National League&#x27;s Houston Astros, were part of the NL squad. Four ValleyCats were voted to play in the game: first baseman Phil Disher, left fielder Jack Shuck, pitcher Philip Rummel, and center fielder Thomas Steele. However, Steele was injured two weeks before the game and was replaced by Tri-City third baseman David Flores. The NL All-Stars won the game on a walk-off RBI by Tri-City&#x27;s David Flores. Flores was also voted MVP of the game.

====No-hitter====
On June 21, 2008, pitchers Shane Wolf, David Miller, and Ashton Mowdy combined to throw the first no-hitter in the franchise&#x27;s history. Wolf is a native of nearby Lansing. The ValleyCats won, 10–0, over the Oneonta Tigers.

====Attendance====
On July 4, 2008, The ValleyCats broke their single-game attendance record drawing 6,630 to the ballpark, 2,130 more than the listed capacity. The ValleyCats won, 9–2, against the Jamestown Jammers. The team also set a season attendance record in 2008 with 140,631 fans in attendance despite missing many games due to rain.

===2009 season===
The ValleyCats once again broke attendance records in 2009. Their single-game attendance record was broken again on July 4 against the Brooklyn Cyclones. A crowd of 6,838 fans attended the 2–1 ValleyCats loss. They also set a new single season attendance record, attracting 145,976 fans to Joseph L. Bruno Stadium that season. Tri-City finished the season in fourth place in the Stedler Division, 18 games behind first-place Lowell.

===2010 Championship season ===
After three losing seasons, the ValleyCats finally turned around to be one of the front runners in the Stedler Division. Led by manager Jim Pankovits, they were the underdog in the 2010 NYPL playoffs with a 38–36 record, and having won their division by only a half game over the Connecticut Tigers. They reached the championship series for the third time in their short history, and beat the heavy favorite Brooklyn Cyclones (51–24), two games to none.

===2015 season===
The second no-hitter in ValleyCats history was thrown on August 6, 2015. Pitchers Kevin McCanna, Ralph Garza, and Zac Person combined for the road win against the Aberdeen IronBirds at Leidos Field at Ripken Stadium, 5–0.

===2021 and beyond===
After the cancelled 2020 minor league season, Major League Baseball took direct control of Minor League Baseball and discontinued short-season play. The ValleyCats were not among the teams invited to continue in affiliated baseball. On January 7, 2021, the team announced that it would be joining the Frontier League, an independent MLB Partner league, for the 2021 season. The 2021 and 2022 seasons were disappointing for the ValleyCats as they missed the playoffs both years. In the 2023 season, the ValleyCats attempted to get into the playoffs. However, they were beaten by the Sussex County Miners for the third and final playoff spot. Despite both clubs having the same record in the East Division, the Miners had a longer winning streak than the Valley Cats. This meant that the ValleyCats missed the playoffs for the fourth year in a row. In 2024, the Valley Cats clinched the playoffs for the first time since 2018, placing second in the East Division. However, they lost to the Ottawa Titans in the Wild Card game 5-2.

==Mascots==

The ValleyCats have several mascots, the three most prominent being SouthPaw, his grandfather, Pappy, and his best friend, Ribbie. SouthPaw is a jersey-wearing cat, representing the &quot;ValleyCat&quot;, the team&#x27;s nickname. Another fan-favorite is Sammy Baseball who wears a patriotic costume and resembles Uncle Sam, reputedly derived from Samuel Wilson who operated a meat packing plant in Troy. The Tri-City Mayors, large caricature heads representing the current Mayors of Troy, Albany, and Schenectady, race (and dance) on a nightly basis at the ballpark. Ketchup, Mustard, and Relish mascots participate in a hot dog race. Other mascots include Spiedie the Chicken, Zoggy the Dinosaur, and Rowdy the River Rat, obtained when the Albany River Rats moved to Charlotte, North Carolina.

<text>Canada has a large and well-developed railway system that primarily transports freight. There are two major publicly traded transcontinental freight railway systems, Canadian National (CN) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC). Nationwide passenger services are provided by the federal crown corporation Via Rail, and three international services to the US by Amtrak. Three Canadian cities have commuter train services: in the Montreal area by Exo, in the Toronto area by GO Transit, and in the Vancouver area by West Coast Express. These cities and several others are also served by light rail or metro systems. Only one (Toronto) has an extensive streetcar (tram) system. Smaller railways such as Ontario Northland Railway also run passenger trains to remote rural areas. The Rocky Mountaineer and Royal Canadian Pacific provide luxury rail tours for viewing scenery in the Canadian Rockies as well as other mountainous areas of British Columbia and Alberta.

Canada has total trackage, of which only is electrified (all urban rail transit networks). Canada uses standard gauge track for the majority of its railway system. The exceptions to this are small lines isolated from the main North American rail network used in resource industries such as mining or forestry, some of which are narrow gauge, and the streetcar and heavy-rail subway lines of the Toronto Transit Commission which use a broad gauge of .

==History==
The first Canadian railway, the Champlain and Saint Lawrence Railroad, was opened outside Montreal in 1836. Heavy expansion of the rail system did not get under way until the Guarantee Act of 1849 that guaranteed bond returns on all railways over . This led to rapid expansion of railways in the Canadas, sometimes excessive growth as uneconomic lines were built since the government guaranteed profits.

This proved disastrous for government finances, however, and the Canadas were all but bankrupted by the subsidies. The largest rail project of this period was also a disaster. The Grand Trunk Railway linking Montreal to Sarnia was finished in 1860, but was vastly mired in debt. In exchange for bailing out the company the government escaped its guarantee on the railway bonds.

Canadian confederation was made possible in part by the railways. The separate colonial governments had all but emptied their treasuries building railways, and a new and more stable method of financing them was required. It was also believed that union would allow for the needed construction of railways linking British North America. The Maritimes joined only because of promises to build the Intercolonial Railway, and British Columbia only because of a promise to build a transcontinental railway.

The government had learned its lesson, and these railways were not funded by guarantees. Rather, the construction of the Intercolonial was fully controlled by the government under the direction of Sir Sanford Fleming.

The railway to the Pacific, the Canadian Pacific, was financed by private funds and through massive land grants in the Canadian prairies (much of it of little value until the railway arrived), $25 million in cash and a guaranteed monopoly. The railway, an engineering marvel that was then the longest in the world, was completed in 1885 to great fanfare.

The booming Canadian economy after 1900 led to plans to build two new transcontinental railways. The Canadian Northern, a successful system covering the northern part of the prairies, and the Grand Trunk (through its Grand Trunk Pacific subsidiary) both launched ambitious plans to expand. The government at first encouraged the two to come to some arrangement and build only one new network, but in the end no agreement was made and the government supported the expansion of both systems. The federal government itself built the National Transcontinental, a line from Moncton, New Brunswick, through Quebec City to Winnipeg, passing through the vast and uninhabited hinterland of the Canadian Shield.

This aggressive expansion proved disastrous when immigration and supplies of capital all but disappeared with the outbreak of the First World War. The Canadian Northern, Grand Trunk Pacific, and Grand Trunk were nationalized by the federal government, which absorbed the debt of over two billion dollars. All three railways, along with the Canadian Government Railways (formed by the Intercolonial, National Transcontinental, and several smaller lines) were then merged into the Canadian National Railways between 1918 and 1923.

The years after the First World War saw only moderate expansion of the rail network and the age of the great railways were over in Canada. The automobile provided strong competition by the 1920s, and after the Second World War most passengers were lost to automobiles and airlines. During the post-war period several large resource lines were opened in Quebec, Labrador, and British Columbia – several of which are not directly connected to the main North American network.

In 1978 the government created Via Rail which took over all national passenger service in the country. In 1987 the &quot;National Transportation Act&quot; partially deregulated the railway industry in Canada and removed much of the red tape that railways experienced when attempting to abandon unprofitable lines; however, the NTA is now viewed as more of a failure in that railways used the legislation merely as a first-resort after &quot;demarketing&quot; a line, rather than a last-resort after trying to find a short line buyer. In November 1995 the federal government privatized CN, and in 1996, the government corrected the NTA 1987 shortfalls with the &quot;Canadian Transportation Act&quot; which more fully deregulates the railway industry.

==Regulatory environment==

While the federal government legislates, and regulates through such bodies as Transport Canada, the railways, various provinces have their own legislation, and indeed if the railway is contained exclusively within the province, are governed by it unless the federal government declares it of importance to the entire country. The Railway Association of Canada, a lobby group, provides lists of legislation, regulation, orders, and circulars on its website.

==List of Canadian railway operators==

The Canadian Transportation Agency maintains a list, with status updates, of federal railway operators. This list is somewhat opaque, because certain owners set up operations in the names of holding companies. This list includes:

* Canadian National Railway
* Canadian Pacific Kansas City
* Hudson Bay Railway Co.
* Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway
* RailLink Canada
* Tshiuetin Rail Transportation
* Via Rail

Provincial and regional railways include:
* Ontario Northland Railway
*New Brunswick Southern Railway
* Metrolinx
In addition, several U.S. operators connect to the Canadian network:

* BNSF Railway
* CSX Transportation
* Norfolk Southern
* Union Pacific

==Rail link(s) with adjacent countries==
* United States – same gauge

<doc id="606599" wikidata="Q16237778" url="?curid=606599" title="The Judd School">
<text>The Judd School (often known simply as Judd) is an 11–18 voluntary aided, grammar school and sixth form in Tonbridge, Kent, England. It was established in 1888 at Stafford House on East Street in Tonbridge, where it remained for eight years before moving to its present location on Brook Street, in the south of the town. Founded by the Worshipful Company of Skinners, it was named after 16th century merchant Sir Andrew Judde, whose endowment helped fund the school. The Skinners&#x27; Company maintains close links with the school and makes up the majority of the governing body.

There are over 1400 students in the school aged 11 to 18; the lower school is all boys, but of over 500 students aged 16–18 in the sixth form, about a fifth are external joiners, many of them girls. The first headmaster was William Bryant, who oversaw the transition to the present site before his retirement in 1908. The current headmaster as of 2025 is Jon Wood, who replaced the previous headmaster, Robert Masters, at the start of the 2017-18 academic year.

Judd pupils generally take eleven General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) tests in Year Eleven (aged 15–16), and are encouraged to take four A-levels in the sixth form. An Office for Standards in Education, Children&#x27;s Services and Skills (Ofsted) inspection in 2015 graded the school as &quot;outstanding&quot;, and league tables published by the Daily Telegraph based on 2013 A-level results rank Judd as the second best (or best, if independent schools are excluded) school in Kent. In 2013, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper ranked the school as the 12th best state secondary school (for pupils aged 11–16, with an optional two further years of education in sixth form) in the country. The majority of students go on to higher education following the completion of their A-levels at the end of Year Thirteen (aged 17–18), and in 2017, over one in five (38) Year 13 students gained an Oxbridge offer.

In September 2004, the school was designated a music and mathematics specialist school, which means it receives additional funding for those subjects. In 2007, the school was invited to become a High Performing Specialist School, and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status. As mathematics is automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to be included under the first specialism. The Judd School is now a specialist school in music with English, science and mathematics.

==History==

===Early years: 1888–1918===

The Judd School was established in 1888, but the need for a secondary school to supplement Sir Andrew Judd&#x27;s Grammar School, a public school (now called Tonbridge School) was acknowledged as early as 1870. It was revealed that only one in 200 of its students was the son of a Tonbridge tradesman, as was required in its endowment. Tonbridge School was founded in 1553 by Sir Andrew Judd, who made a fortune in the Muscovy fur trade during the 16th century. His endowment was left in the hands of the Skinners Company, who agreed to fund the establishment of a commercial school in Tonbridge in 1875. However, the Charity Commissioners – empowered by the 1869 Endowed Schools Act to govern the establishment of charitably funded schools – directed that the £20,000 provided by The Skinners&#x27; Company for this cause be taken to neighbouring Tunbridge Wells, where it was used to establish The Skinners&#x27; School in September 1887.

Demand persisted for a similar school in Tonbridge; in July 1888, William J. D. Bryant, previously an assistant master at Tonbridge School, was named headmaster of Sir Andrew Judd&#x27;s Commercial School, which opened on 17 September at Stafford House in East Street, Tonbridge. The funds were provided by a loan of £13,000 repaid over the next 20 years with income from the Judd Foundation (of which The Skinners&#x27; Company were trustees), which rapidly increased when the leases on the Sandhills Estate in London were renewed in 1906. The school also benefited from at least £500 per year from the Judd Foundation, after funding for Tonbridge School was reduced. Although established on a tentative basis, the school&#x27;s early success led to its move to a larger, purpose-built site in south Tonbridge in 1896.

William Bryant retired as headmaster in 1908 and was replaced by John Evans, appointed in preference to the 217 other applicants for the post. Previously headmaster of Ashford Grammar School, Evans took up his new position at the conclusion of the autumn term. He oversaw a period of change and modernisation, including the transition from gas to electric lighting, and the introduction of a house system in 1909. Soon after the outbreak of the First World War the school was requisitioned by the War Office to house two brigades, from Folkestone and Aldershot. In 1917, the school Cadet Corps was established, which within one month consisted of 120 students. The following year, and according to Taylor (1988) &quot;much to the Headmaster&#x27;s distaste&quot;, the first female teachers were appointed after the deaths of several male members of staff.

===Inter-war years: 1919–1939===
In June 1919, soon after the passage of Education Act 1918, the school successfully applied for grant-earning status and became partly state-funded. As a consequence, it became necessary to introduce a composite governing board (including public representatives) and to offer free places, equal to 25 per cent of the normal number of admissions. In 1925, the school saw its first students enter the Oxbridge universities and changed its name to simply The Judd School. Evans retired in 1928 and was replaced by Welshman Cecil Lloyd Morgan who beat 164 other applicants to a job which carried an annual salary of £650. He oversaw a change in the curriculum such that each form was divided into two streams, of which one took Latin, the other more vocational subjects. Morgan continued as many of the Judd customs as long as he could, including the tradition of donating £20 per year to send a Barnardo boy to Australia or Canada.

===Second World War: 1939–1945===
The outbreak of the Second World War on 1939 delayed the commencement of the Autumn Term until trenches could be dug at the school. To avoid the bombing raids, 369 students of the Westminster City School in London were evacuated to The Judd School in the relative safety of Tonbridge. Initially, each school used the facilities three days per week, but Taylor (1988) notes that &quot;imaginative timetables&quot; enabled all Judd pupils to attend five days a week by the end of 1941. The Westminster boys were instructed to further evacuate to Exmouth, Devon in July 1944, but ended up fleeing back to London. In a bombing raid that same year a rocket shell exploded in a neighbouring field, destroying more than 200 panes of glass and numerous doors and windows. By the end of the war, 60 former pupils had lost their lives, and 48 were decorated. On 1944, The Judd School became the first in the country to be awarded the status of a voluntarily aided grammar school in new legislation brought in by the Butler Education Act, which meant it received state funding, but could continue to select pupils by ability.

===Post-war years: 1945–1986===

Francis Hillier Taylor, previously senior history master at The Skinners&#x27; School, was appointed as Morgan&#x27;s successor at the end of the spring term in 1946, a position that attracted 321 applications. During his tenure, Taylor significantly expanded the school facilities: in 1948, the headmaster&#x27;s living quarters were converted to include a secretaries office, waiting room and medical inspection room (the headmaster moved to neighbouring Brook House, which was purchased by The Skinners&#x27; Company). In 1955, new geography rooms were constructed, followed three years later by a new gymnasium. Although not first used until two years later, a swimming pool was constructed in 1964 at the cost of £9,000. Taylor also introduced some major curriculum changes, including the introduction of new subjects such as rural biology and zoology.

Denis Rendall took over in 1970, at a time when the future of the school was under threat from the Circular 10/65, which proposed the abolition of grammar schools, which select pupils according to their academic ability, in favour of the comprehensive schools, which are non-selective state funded schools. He oversaw the building of the new art and crafts department building, currently the R.E. block, which opened in May 1974, and the purchase of a neighbouring detached house, 10 Brook Street, by the Kent Education Committee. Known as &quot;Lawton&#x27;s&quot;, this building is now used by music department, and contains a suite of computers, and also houses a changing room for female pupils. Rendall experienced a high turnover of staff: 31 teachers were at the school in the year of his arrival, and 43 joined and left the school between 1970 and 1986. He increased the number of female staff from zero to seven during his tenure, and the student body grew from 463 to 746 during these years.

===Recent years: 1986–present===
Rendall was succeeded in 1986 by Keith Starling, who further developed and expanded the school to celebrate its centenary; the £2 million Cohen Building was constructed in 1991, followed by a £1.4 million music centre in 1995. Other developments include the Library Building, built in 2002, and a new sports hall in 2003; much of the construction funds was raised by parents. More recent developments include the Atwell building - which houses Maths and Geography - and the Ashton building - which houses the school&#x27;s new canteen as well as four Biology laboratories.

After Starling&#x27;s retirement in 2004, Robert Masters was appointed as his replacement and oversaw the school&#x27;s transition to music and maths specialist status in 2004. Following an &quot;outstanding&quot; result in a 2007 Ofsted inspection, the school was invited to become a High Performing Specialist School and in April 2008 was successful in attaining science specialism status. As mathematics is automatically included under a science specialism, the school selected English to join music under the first specialism. Mr Masters also organised the building of the school&#x27;s all-weather pitch, which was completed in 2006.

==Governance==

The Judd School foundation document, which was approved by Queen Victoria on 1889, stipulated that the Board of Governors had right of appointment and dismissal of the headmaster, who has the same powers over the rest of the staff. Major decisions were made by The Skinners&#x27; Company, but its powers were restricted by the Charity Commissioners, who were granted considerable powers under the Endowed Schools Act. Soon after the First World War, in the wake of the Education Act 1918, the Burnham Scale of teacher&#x27;s salaries came into force and the school was forced to enter into negotiations with the Kent Education Committee to meet the increased expenditure; the Court of The Skinners&#x27; Company approved the school becoming grant earning in June 1919. It became necessary to appoint a composite governing body, a third of them public representatives nominated by the Kent Education Committee, who also had some control over school affairs. Subsequently, a fee of one guinea was paid to those who attended meetings of the governing body, the first of which was held on 4 February 1920, at Skinners&#x27; Hall in London.

After applying for voluntary aided status, the school was required to adopt new Articles of Government on , 1944. It became the first school in the country to be awarded the dual control of state funding and limited independence. The Kent Education Committee funded free dinners for some pupils, travel and maintenance grants and created a common entrance exam. The current governing body consists of a chair and vice chair, ten foundation governors (elected by the Worshipful Company of Skinners), three parent governors, two Local Education Authority (LEA) governors, three staff governors, an education officer and clerk, education assistant, assistant clerk and the headmaster.

==School structure==

The majority of the school&#x27;s first pupils joined from Gordon House, which was a successful private school on Hadlow Road run by ; after it was decided that the two schools should not compete, Grice was appointed deputy headmaster of The Judd School. On the opening day, 40 boys were in attendance, rising to 50 by the end of the first term and to 115 in 1902. In 1917, the school had 244 pupils, which increased to 308 over the next 11 years, and reached 376 in 1935. In 1952, 380 boys were on the roll, which included 42 sixth form students. Under Denis Rendall, the school experienced a strong growth in numbers; in 1970, there were 463 pupils, increasing to 689 in 1978, and to 742 in 1986. At the last Ofsted inspection in 2007, The Judd School had 933 students. According to the school, as of 2010, the student body is made up of 935 students: 625 in the lower school and 310 in the sixth form, including about 60 girls. Many students come from affluent backgrounds and very few require free school meals; the number of students with disabilities, learning difficulties and special educational needs is well below the national average. The majority of students go on to higher education at the end of Year Thirteen.

The house system was first established in 1909, when there were three houses: Alpha, Beta and Gamma, each of which had a housemaster and captain. Boys remained in the same house for their entire school career, and would be joined by any siblings. Every year, the houses competed for the House Shield; points were awarded for all forms of competitions, from sword dancing to vaulting. In 1914, house colours were introduced; purple for Alpha, green for Beta, and scarlet for Gamma. As the student body increased, a fourth houseDeltawas formed in 1917, for which the colour was yellow. The house system was abolished in the 1980s, but re-introduced in September 2008, with houses named after notable alumni. The four houses were: Duke (after Neville Duke), Hodge (after Donald Hodge), Lewin (after Terence Lewin) and Powell (after Cecil Frank Powell). The house system was changed in 2017, due to a large increase in pupil numbers. There are currently six houses, named after previous headmasters (excluding Robert Masters, the seventh headmaster); Morgan, Starling, Rendall, Bryant, Taylor, Evans.

===Lower school===
In its early years, boys entered the school mainly from local elementary (now known as primary) schools from ages eight onwards; at that time, the maximum age of a pupil was 16, although any boy who reached this age during the course of a term was permitted to remain until the end of that term. In 1908, a government inspection noted that the average pupil remained at the school for three and a half years and left the school between the ages of 14 and 15, and that 20 per cent of the intake held scholarships. The lower school as it is today was first established by the &quot;Five Year Plan&quot; following a government inspection in 1933. In 1944, following the Butler Education Act, entrance to the school was gained through a common entrance exam, aged 11 or 12; five boys offered themselves for each place, and most came from local primary schools. Prior to the establishment of the sixth form, The Judd School passed several boys to Tonbridge School, or other grammar schools, to complete their education to the age of 18 or 19; £20 was paid as a leaving scholarship.

As of 2010, the lower school has an annual intake of around 125 boys at the beginning of Year Seven (aged 11). The lower school (Years 7–11) is 625 students (all boys) strong, for whom the school uniform consists of a navy blazer accompanied with the school badge on the breast pocket, with grey trousers and a grey or white shirt. Socks must be dark, and shoes must be black. Shirts must be worn with a tie, which varies according to the house in which the student is placed; green for Rendall, light blue for Starling, purple for Taylor, red for Bryant, yellow for Morgan, and orange for Evans.

The Judd School sixth form can be said to have been established as early as 1903in the wake of the Education Act 1902when the Pupil Teachers Scheme was born and The Judd School was used as a training centre for young teachers. However, normal pupils above the age of 16 were not permitted until 1919; previously, special permission from the governors was required to stay on beyond this age. A 1952 government inspection stated that 42 students were in the sixth form. Judd&#x27;s sixth form has significantly grown over the last decade, consisting of 308 students at the last Ofsted inspection in 2007. A minimum of 40 offers per year will be made to external applicants; girls are admitted in Year Twelve (aged 16) and make up about 16 per cent of the sixth form. The sixth form has its own Common Room in the main school building, including a dedicated cafeteria and study area.

Boys may wear a dark grey or black suit, plain black, grey or navy V-neck sweater and a scarf of a plain colour. Girls may wear plain tailored suits (skirt or trousers) in black, navy or dark grey. Shirts may be plain grey, blue or white. There is a sixth form house tie available, although girls may choose to wear a pin badge instead.

===Staff===
In July 1904, The Judd School participated in the Pupil Teachers Scheme on an experimental basis. Established in the 1902 Education Act, students would receive a normal secondary education, before receiving two years of training, splitting their time between a Pupil Teacher&#x27;s Centre and practical experience at elementary and secondary schools. The experiment was dropped soon after the First World War. When the school became grant earning in 1919, the additional funds meant teachers received pensions under the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act 1918. In 1970, 31 staff taught 463 boys; 45 taught 745 in 1988. According to the 2009 school prospectus, there are 71 teaching staff, 20 visiting music staff and 36 additional support, administration and maintenance staff.

==Admission==

The Judd School opened as a day school for local pupils living with their parents, between the ages of 8 and 16. According to the foundation document, the conditions of entry were possession of a &quot;good character&quot; and &quot;sufficient health&quot;; sons of freemen of The Skinners&#x27; Company were given preference when the number of applicants exceeded the places available. During his tenure, William Bryant attempted to extend admission to boarders and estimated the costs to be £50 per term (including fees), but the Board of Governors rejected the idea. However, when a lack of public transport made day-to-day travel to the school impractical, boys were permitted to lodge from neighbouring villages and would stay at masters&#x27; homes or at hostels approved by the governors. Entry to the school was conditional upon a pupil passing an entrance exam, which would vary according to the age of the boy. However, the foundation document stipulated that every boy had to be able to read, write from dictation and perform sums in the &quot;first four simple rules of Arithmetic, with the multiplication table&quot;.

In 1944, The Butler Education Act confirmed The Judd School as a grammar school, at which time it applied for voluntarily aided status, which required it to abolish fees under the principle of universal free education. The school was required to offer entrance via an entrance examination, now known as the 11-plus, which pupils take aged 10 or 11, depending on their date of birth. Provision was made for pupils to enter aged 13 or 14, for those that had failed the test two years earlier. While defining the school-leaving age as 15, the act granted the government the power to raise the age to 16 &quot;as soon as the Minister is satisfied that it has become practicable&quot;, which happened in 1973.

Admission continues to be via the Eleven Plus examination; The Judd School complies with the Co-ordinated Admission Scheme, which is administered by the Kent Local Authority. All pupils must have gained a selective place through the Eleven Plus and placed The Judd School as a preference on their application form. Because the school is usually over-subscribed, priority is given to students in Local Authority Care in the first instance. Students are then ranked according to their aggregate scores in the Eleven Plus, and the distance from a students home to the school (as the crow flies) is used as a tiebreaker.

Pupils are also admitted to the sixth form aged 16 or 17, for which similar criteria are applied. External students must have at least five predicted A* GCSEs and will be given conditional offers based on how high their predicted grades are. In the event of over-subscription, priority will be given to internal applicants, followed by external applicants in Local Authority Care. Students are then ranked according to their predicted or actual GCSE results, and the distance to school is again used as a tiebreaker. Should entrance be refused for any reason, parents have a statutory right of appeal, which is heard by the governors of the school. In 2007, the school was ordered to pay compensation to two pupils after it was deemed that they did not receive fair appeals because of what the Local Government Ombudsman deemed &quot;inappropriate links&quot; between the appeals panel and the governors.

===Fees===
The foundation document stipulated that fees were to be fixed by the governors and could range from £4–8 per year; in 1888, the fees charged were £7/10s per year. Provision was made for the allocation of scholarships to the value of the tuition fees for one in every ten boys in the school; one-half of the scholarships were arranged by the governors and awarded only to boys who had spent three years education in a public elementary school. Around the turn of the 20th century, an attempt was made to attract younger boys into the school by reducing fees for those under the age of 12 from £2/20s to £2 per term.

In July 1919, the school applied for grant-earning status, and as a result, 25 per cent of the places became free. As part of this change, the fee structure was changed to £3/10s per term, or ten guineas per annum. In 1944, in accordance with the Butler Education Act, fees were abolished under the principle of universal free education. Parents are encouraged to contribute to The Judd School Development Fund, which raises money for future construction projects.

The school continues to be state-funded and thus charges no fees.

==Curriculum==
The first prospectus promised &quot;religious instruction in accordance with the principles of the Christian Faith&quot; and the following subjects: reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, history, English (grammar, composition, and literature), Latin, at least one other foreign European language, mathematics, bookkeeping, natural science, drawing, drill, and vocal music. It also said that instruction may also be given &quot;in the use of tools for working in wood&quot;, for which a carpentry shed was placed in the yard of Stafford House. At the turn of the 20th century, 15 subjects were taught and lessons lasted one hour; school began at nine, and the day included 15 minutes of hymns, prayers and roll calls.

German was first introduced into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948, rural biology was added to the curriculum for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land to be used as a vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).

As of 2025, the school follows the National Curriculum in Years 7–11 and offers a broad range of GCSEs (national exams taken by students aged 14–16) and A-levels (national exams taken by pupils aged 16–18). The school has no affiliation with a particular religious denomination, but religious education is given throughout the school, and boys must take the subject as part of their GCSE course. Students participate in a number of educational visits and excursions throughout their school career, and Year Twelve students participate in a five-day work experience programme. The curriculum comprises English, Mathematics, three separate sciences (Biology, Chemistry and Physics), 3 Languages (French, German and Latin), History, Geography, Religious Education, Computer Science, Art, Drama, Music, Design and Technology, PE and Games, and a bespoke Learn, Grow, Belong (PSHE) curriculum. In the second year, students are divided in Mathematics, based on their ability. Boys usually take eleven subjects for GCSE, English (Language and Literature), Mathematics, all three separate sciences, Religious Studies, a foreign language, a humanity (Geography or History), a creative subject, and another free choice from any remaining options. Some students are offered the opportunity to study an additional, twelfth Mathematics qualification, which for most selected students is the Level 2 Certificate in Further Mathematics, but the highest achieving students are instead put forward for the Free Standing Maths Qualification (FSMQ). In recent years, the school has also offered a GCSE in Classical Languages, and History has been offered as two separate GCSEs with students selecting either of Modern History and Ancient History.

In the sixth form, pupils begin by studying four A-Levels, but some choose only to sit exams for three A-Levels. A wide choice of subjects is offered at A-level: English Literature, French, German, Latin, Classical Civilisation, Art, Design and Technology, Music, Geography, History, Economics, Politics, Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Religious Studies, Philosophy, Computer Science and P.E. Most combinations of subjects can be accommodated. Students also have the opportunity to take an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) in the spring term of Year 12. All students participate in a games activity on a Wednesday afternoon every fortnight.

The school year runs from September to July, split across three terms: the autumn term (September to December), the spring term (January to April) and the summer term (April to July). Students receive two weeks off for Christmas and Easter, a six-week summer break, and three &quot;half-term&quot; breaks.

===Examination===
Until the establishment of the General Certificate of Education, exams were set once a year by an external examiner(s) appointed by the governors, who reported in writing on the general proficiency of pupils, as well as the condition of the school. A 1902 report by examiner Dr. Wormell found that the curriculum was &quot;sufficient to help those few capable of rising to something higher by providing a bridge between elementary school and grammar school&quot;. He criticised the absence of German tuition and the fact that more than half the students came &quot;feebly taught from country districts&quot;. The headmaster would also submit a written report to the governors.

In 1951, the school adopted the General Certificate of Education, but students were barred from taking any exams before the age of 16, which meant that many students left school without any qualifications because of the sheer necessity of leaving school to contribute to household income. The system became more rational in time, but often pupils were taking O-levels and A-levels simultaneously. As of 2010, the school offers GCSEs to students in the lower school, and AS/A-levels to students in the sixth form. Under Rendall, exam pass rates at A-level increased from 67.5 per cent in 1970, peaking at 95 per cent in 1984 before decreasing slightly to 92 per cent in 1987. O-level/GCSE results have similarly improved, reaching a peak of 88 per cent pass rate in 1978.

== Academic Performance ==
The Judd School performs consistently highly above average in national examinations, with 90% of GCSE entries and 89% of A Level entries achieving A*-B grades in 2019. League tables published by the BBC based on 2008 A Level results rank Judd as the fourth best school in Kent. In its 2022 league table of the best selective schools in the United Kingdom, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ranked The Judd School 18th.

The vast majority of students at the school go on to attend university, and the school has consistently high Oxbridge offer rates.

==Extra-curricular activities==
School clubs and societies include various language clubs, sport clubs, musical activities, politics and debating societies, a Voluntary Service Unit, Young Enterprise and many others. Some clubs include the classics club, Greek club, chess club, cipher club, geography club, scrabble club, Chinese culture club, puzzle club, philosophy club, board games club, French film club, squash club and homework club. Students may also participate in the Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award Scheme. Now defunct school societies have included a Young Farmers Club, Jazz Society, Science Society, Stamp Club, Literary and Debating Society, and the League of Nations Union.

Extra-curricular musical opportunities include: Choir, Junior Singers, Chamber Choir, Judd Brass, Big Bands, String Orchestra, Concert Band, Symphony Orchestra and Junior Orchestra; students give up to 40 concerts per year. Instrumental lessons are available through the school, for which a charge is made. Organised drama at the school began at the latest in 1929, with performances including &quot;Richard II&quot; and &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. Despite the minimum of theatrical equipment, Taylor (1988) notes that &quot;much has been achieved&quot; and at times the headmaster himself took a leading role.

The school cadet corps, a national program now known as the Combined Cadet Force, was formed towards the end of 1917 and 120 cadets were recruited within a month. The governors provided £25 towards their initial expenses, and volunteers contributed haversacks, water bottles, dummy rifles and trips to summer camp. Training initially took place on the Tonbridge School rifle range. By 1952, the number of volunteer cadets had fallen to 90. During the 1970s, numbers averaged about 150 cadets. The school&#x27;s Combined Cadet Force currently comprises both an Army and a Royal Air Force Section with a total establishment strength of 120 cadets, who meet on Friday afternoons following a full school day. Membership remains voluntary, and boys can join from Year Nine (aged 13–14).

===Sport===

At lower school level, there are regular games for &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; teams in most sports, so that many of the students have the chance to represent the school; in Year Seven there are occasionally &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot; team rugby matches. A programme of inter-house competitions, caters for those who are not school team players. The main games are rugby, football, cross-country, and basketball during the winter months, and cricket, tennis and athletics during the summer term. The school features on a national scale in its 4 main sports (rugby, cross country, cricket and athletics) and in 2017 was ranked the 2nd best state school for sport by the School&#x27;s Sports Magazine.

The school adopted the rugby code of football in 1923, at which time it was played on soccer pitches; the first games against other schools were played during the 1925–26 season, and rugby was played by all students by 1927. The school reached the quarterfinals of the premier national schools rugby competition, the NatWest Schools Cup, in 2017 and 2018. As of 2010, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; rugby teams play against local grammar schools. The most important fixture in the Judd sporting calendar is the annual match against The Skinners&#x27; School. Boys are often rewarded for their efforts with international tours, and rugby sevens is also played at the school. In the 2008–09 season, the under-15 rugby team advanced to the final of the national schools Daily Mail Cup at Twickenham on 2009 but lost 11–34 to Millfield. Football had been played at the school since its foundation and in 1908, despite the inadequacy of the school&#x27;s pitches, was the primary winter game. However, by 1925 rugby was the predominant winter sport, and three years later footballs were banned from the school.

Burgess (2000) notes that The Judd School has a &quot;fine reputation for its cricket teams&quot;, and as the primary summer game, the sport remains popular today. The Judd School offers cricket academies from Year Eight (aged 12–13) onwards, with training available all year round. In recent years Judd has found success in County Cup competitions at all age groups.

In both cross country and athletics Judd competes nationally and internationally, winning competitions such as the National Schools&#x27; Cup in both sports at junior and intermediate level. The school has won 6 of 10, and the King Henry VIII relays in Coventry. In 2004, the school&#x27;s cross country team became the first school in a decade to end the dominance of public schools Winchester College and St Albans School at the Knole run in Sevenoaks. The school cross country squad has an annual training camp in Lanzarote in December, which acts as both a reward for effort and a valuable warm-weather training camp in preparation for January&#x27;s Knole Run. The school holds weekly matches against local schools. School teams compete in other sports such as basketball, tennis and hockey. During the 2020 and 2021 UK COVID-19 lockdowns the school&#x27;s Cross Country Team organised two virtual charity runs in support of NHS Charities Together and Greenhouse Sports. The student-organised events raised a combined total of £13,578.

==Property==

===Stafford House===
Upon its foundation, whenaccording to Green (1990)it was said to be a &quot;temporary expedient&quot;, the school was based at Stafford House, in East Street in the centre of Tonbridge. Previously used by private tutor Isaac Fleming in 1878, it was a building whose central urban position was, Taylor (1988) said, a &quot;major asset, and possibly the only one&quot;; Headmaster Bryant &quot;bore its numerous shortcomings, its bricked ambience and grasslessness&quot;. Positioned in a narrow street and originally designed for 20 boarders, traffic noise, awkward arrangement and low pitch of the classrooms and the distance of the school from its playing fields made the building far from ideal. It underwent repairs and alterations to the value of £300, carried out by a local builder; several partition walls were knocked down to form larger rooms, although this still restricted the bench length in even the widest of the rooms to , and 18 pupils. The floor of the main schoolroom was restored and lavatory closets and urinals were installed. Later, a carpentry shed was placed in the yard, and a &quot;Mr Russell&quot; was appointed as its first occupant in October 1889. &quot;Mr Beeching&#x27;s field&quot; was usedat what Taylor (1988) considered &quot;an extortionate sum&quot;for games, but it was unavailable for four months of the year when it was used to grow hay. Beeching ended this arrangement in April 1889, at which time the school used the YMCA field, for £20 per year. In June of that year, a shed to house cricket equipment was constructed at the cost of £13/10s. It was soon decided that there was a need for more &quot;wholesome&quot; surroundings, and it was generally accepted that south Tonbridge would be more suitable for the development of a new school.

===Brook Street site===
After Bloodshotts field (the current location of Tonbridge Grammar School) was rejected as an inferior site, &quot;Mr Deacon&#x27;s Field&quot; in Haysden Lane (now Brook Street) was acquired from Sir Edmund Hardinge&#x27;s trustees for £240 per acre, a total of £2,059. At one point owned by Sir Andrew Judd, the site consisted of of land, which according to Taylor (1988) sloped &quot;gently from the road to the rear of the site&quot;. Plans, by Campbell Jones, were submitted to the headmaster in July 1883; they included a covered playground, red-bricked buildings incorporating local sandstone, Broseley roof tiles and a small basement housing a boiler. The construction was carried out by Messrs Turners of Watford, and total construction costs were £8,637. Nearly two years later, on 27 April 1895, the Foundation Stone was laid, at which time Lewis Boyd Sebastian, Master of The Skinners&#x27; Company performed a small ceremony. Opened in March 1896, the building featured an oak Neo-Georgian fleche surmounting an Oregon pine hammer-beamed roof. The principal entrance was carved by Messrs Lornie of London and featured shields bearing the coat of arms of Sir Andrew Judd and the company, the only architectural flourish allowed by the low budget.

In addition to the &quot;schoolroom&quot;, which was larger than the Town Public Hall, the building consisted of a dining hall (cum gymnasium), the masters common room to the east and a block of six classrooms to the west. The headmaster&#x27;s house was completed at the same time as the main school building, and had five bedrooms wired with electric bells, and a bathroom plumbed with hot and cold water. In November 1920, an organ was built at a cost of over £1,000, and placed in the schoolroom as a memorial to the old boys and masters who died in the First World War. A new gymnasium was constructed after a 1956 survey deemed its predecessor economically irreparable. Accompanied by the construction of three hard tennis courts, it was opened by Sir Benjamin Brodie in 1958, but lacked adjoining changing rooms, washing facilities and office facilities for members of the physical education staff.
Now known as &quot;Lawton&#x27;s&quot;, 10 Brook Street was purchased during the early 1970s using funds provided by the Kent Education Committee, after whose chairman the building is now named. A £2 million classroom and technology building (the &quot;Cohen Building&quot;), together with two new science laboratories, was opened in 1991. A new music centre, financed by voluntary donations, was opened in 1995 and a schoolroom annexe followed in 1997. The most recent developments are a library/classroom building in 2002, a new sports hall in 2003 and an all-weather pitch in 2006. The Atwell Building, formerly known as the &quot;Maths-Geography Block&quot;, opened in 2009 after suffering delays after the original building contractor went out of business. There has been a new school building constructed, providing four new Biology labs and a new canteen to expand on the outdated old canteen in the main school building. After delays, it was completed in Easter 2017, entitled the &quot;Ashton Building&quot;, and is currently in use. There are new pitches at Vizards that were officially completed in January 2017. There are several grass pitches as well as one of the largest 3G pitches in the UK. The school grounds have sufficient space for two rugby pitches and training grids in the winter months, or a running track, and a cricket ground (with nets) for summer. There are also two asphalt tennis courts, an all weather pitch and an air rifle range used by the school&#x27;s Combined Cadet Force.
By 2018, the Guy Hands Library had been added. A new development the new Sixth Form Centre with its 200m2 study area, offices, meeting rooms and a tremendous view is under construction.

===Yeoman&#x27;s fields===
The &quot;Yeoman&#x27;s fields&quot; site was purchased after a government inspection in 1933 recommended the school seek more land. The site consists of of level, dry land that requires little conditioning, making it ideal for the full-sized rugby pitches, which came into regular use in 1935. Previously part of meadlow land termed the &quot;Townlands&quot;, it was purchased by the Kent Education Committee from the Town Wardens and soon equipped with hedges, lavatories and a pavilion. In 1939, trenches were dug in the field in preparation for the Second World War.

On 26 April 2016, it was revealed that the &quot;Yeoman&#x27;s fields&quot; site had been sold to help fund a new set of playing fields, which are situated near Lower Haysden Lane at the &quot;Vizards&quot; site. The new playing fields tackled the issue of increasing student numbers.

<text>In history, religion and political science, a purge is a position removal or execution of people who are considered undesirable by those in power from a government, another, their team leaders, or society as a whole. A group undertaking such an effort is labeled as purging itself. Purges can be either nonviolent or violent, with the former often resolved by the simple removal of those who have been purged from office, and the latter often resolved by the imprisonment, exile, or murder of those who have been purged.

==Characteristics==
The Shanghai massacre of 1927 in China and the Night of the Long Knives of 1934 in Nazi Germany, in which the leader of a political party turns against a particular section or group within the party and kills its members, are commonly called &quot;purges&quot;. Mass expulsions of populations on the grounds of racism and xenophobia, such as the deportation of the Crimean Tatars in the Soviet Union, are not.

Though sudden and violent purges are notable, most purges do not involve immediate execution or imprisonment, for example the periodic massive purges of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on grounds of apathy or dereliction, or the purge of Jews and political dissenters from the German Civil Service in 1933–1934.

Beginning in 1966, Chairman Mao Zedong and his associates purged much of the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s leadership, including the head of state, President Liu Shaoqi and the then-Secretary-General, Deng Xiaoping, as part of what the leaders termed the Cultural Revolution. In Maoist states, sentences usually involved hard labor in &quot;laogai&quot; camps and executions. Deng Xiaoping acquired a reputation for returning to power after he had been purged several times.

==Historical use of the term==
===English Civil War purge, 1648–1650===

The earliest use of the term dates back to the English Civil War&#x27;s Pride&#x27;s Purge. In 1648–1650, the moderate members of the English Long Parliament were purged by the New Model Army. The Parliament of England would suffer subsequent purges under Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Commonwealth of England, including the purge of the entire House of Lords. Counter-revolutionaries such as royalists and more radical revolutionaries such as the Levellers were purged. After the Stuart Restoration, obstinate republicans were purged while some fled to the New England Colonies in British America.

===Soviet Union===

Purges were frequent in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, military and internal security elites were more likely to be detained than civilian elites.

The term &quot;purge&quot; is often associated with Stalinism. While leading the USSR, Joseph Stalin carried out repeated purges which resulted in tens of thousands of people sentenced to Gulag labor camps and the outright executions of rival communists, military officers, ethnic minorities, wreckers, and citizens accused of plotting against communism. Stalin together with Nikolai Yezhov initiated the most notorious of the CPSU purges, the Great Purge, during the mid to late 1930s.

===Nazi Germany===

In 1934, Chancellor Adolf Hitler ordered the execution of Ernst Röhm, other leaders of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; militia, and political opponents.

===France after WWII===

After France&#x27;s liberation by the Allies in 1944, the Provisional Government of the French Republic and particularly the French Resistance carried out purges of former collaborationists, the so-called &quot;vichystes&quot;. The process became known in legal terms as &quot;épuration légale&quot; (&quot;legal purging&quot;). Similar processes in other countries and on other occasions included denazification in Allied-occupied Germany and decommunization in post-communist states.

===Japan after WWII===
The Red Purge was an anticommunist movement in occupied Japan from the late 1940s to the early 1950s. Carried out by the Japanese government and private corporations with the aid and encouragement of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP), the Red Purge resulted in tens of thousands of alleged members, supporters, or sympathizers of left-wing groups, especially those said to be affiliated with the Japanese Communist Party, removed from their jobs in government, the private sector, universities, and schools. The Red Purge emerged from rising Cold War tensions and the Red Scare after World War II, and was a significant element within a broader &quot;Reverse Course&quot; in Occupation policies. The Red Purge reached a peak following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, when communist China supported North Korea. It began to ease after General Douglas MacArthur was replaced as commander of the Occupation by General Matthew Ridgway in 1951, and came to a conclusion with the end of the Occupation in 1952.

===Communist Cuba===

After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Fidel Castro of Cuba often purged those who had previously been involved with the Batista regime. Purges usually involved the execution of the condemned. Castro periodically carried out purges in the Communist Party of Cuba thereafter. One prominent purge was carried out in 1989 when a high-ranking Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces general named Arnaldo Ochoa was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on charges of drug trafficking. Purges became less common in Cuba during the 1990s and 2000s.

=== United States: Red Scares, HUAC and McCarthyism ===

In the period 1938–1975, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), an investigative committee of the United States House of Representatives, carried out a campaign of purging alleged &quot;communist sympathizers&quot; from positions in public life. While non-violent, HUAC&#x27;s campaign destroyed the careers of many individuals, particularly in the entertainment industry, where HUAC attempted to purge left-wing voices entirely from the industry through the Hollywood blacklist.

While not part of HUAC, U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy was a major driver of efforts to purge perceived communist sympathizers through the 1940s and 1950s, which ended in his condemnation and censure in 1954.

==In the 21st century==
=== China ===
Some observers consider the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping to be a purge. A far-reaching campaign against corruption began in China following the conclusion of the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012. The campaign, carried out under the aegis of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, was the largest organized purported anti-graft effort in the history of Communist rule in China.

===Iran===

The Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution of the Iranian government purged universities.

In August 2023, the government reportedly had a program to hire 15,000 replacements for people in universities and to place clerics in schools. It also removed Tehran University of Art’s major curricula for sculpting, music and cinematography/filmmaking.
The government added Islamic studies even more so. Many academics were terminated/fired. On 14 December 2023 the Ministry of Education announced that it would hire 7000 clerics instead of teachers.

===Iraq===

De-Ba&#x27;athification was undertaken by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and subsequent Iraqi governments to remove the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s influence in the new Iraqi political system after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. It was first outlined in CPA Order 1 which entered into force on 16 May 2003. The order declared that all public sector employees affiliated with the Ba&#x27;ath Party were to be removed from their positions and to be banned from any future employment in the public sector.

It is estimated that, before 2007, 50,000 civil government employees, as well as employees of other organizations listed in Annex A of Order No. 2, were removed from their positions as a result of de-Ba&#x27;athification. Another estimate places the number, also before 2007, at &quot;100,000 civil servants, doctors, and teachers&quot;, who were forcibly removed from the public sector due to low-level affiliation.

===North Korea===

Members of the Kim family have each periodically purged their political rivals or perceived threats since consolidating their control over North Korea, beginning in the 1950s. The most senior Kim purged those who opposed his son&#x27;s succession to the supreme leadership of North Korea. Kim Il Sung&#x27;s most prominent purge occurred during the &quot;August Incident&quot; in 1956, when the pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese Yanan factions of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea (WPK) attempted to depose Kim. Most of those involved in the plot were executed while some others fled to the USSR and China. While some purges were carried out under Kim Jong Il, they were not as common as they were under his father/son. Kim Jong Un purged several high-ranking officials and generals installed by his father Kim Jong Il in the former&#x27;s first years in power, including, most prominently, his uncle Jang Song-thaek.

===Turkey===

After the failed 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt, the Government of Turkey under Recep Tayyip Erdoğan began a purge against members of its civil service and the Turkish Armed Forces. The purge ostensibly focused mainly on public servants and soldiers alleged to be part of the Gülen movement, the group the government blamed for the coup. As part of the purge, about 200,000 public officials, including thousands of judges, were dismissed and detained. Politicized Kurds in Turkey have also been a major target of the Justice and Development Party-led purge.

<text>The Goldman Environmental Prize is a prize awarded annually to grassroots environmental activists.

== History ==
Awardees are named from each of the world&#x27;s six geographic regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Islands and Island Nations, North America, and South and Central America. The award is given by the Goldman Environmental Foundation headquartered in San Francisco, California. The Prize is often referred to as the Green Nobel&quot;.&quot;

The Goldman Environmental Prize was created in 1989 by philanthropists Richard and Rhoda Goldman. , the award amount is $200,000.

The winners are selected by an international jury who receive confidential nominations from a worldwide network of environmental organizations and individuals. Prize winners participate in a 10-day tour of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., for an awards ceremony and presentation, news conferences, media briefings and meetings with political, public policy, financial and environmental leaders. The award ceremony features short documentary videos on each winner, narrated by Robert Redford through the year 2020, and Sigourney Weaver beginning in 2021.

The 2019 Goldman Environmental Prize ceremony marking the 30th anniversary took place on April 29, 2019, at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco. A second award ceremony took place on May 1, 2019, in Washington, D.C.

The 2020, 2021, and 2022 Goldman Environmental Prize ceremonies took place online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with pre-recorded videos premiering on November 30, 2020, June 15, 2021, and May 25, 2022, respectively.

Live ceremonies resumed in 2023, taking place in San Francisco on April 24 and in Washington, D.C., on April 26.

<doc id="606606" wikidata="Q670019" url="?curid=606606" title="Lenzing">
<text>Lenzing is a small town of approximately 5,000 residents, three kilometers north of Lake Attersee in Austria, It is located in the Upper Austrian part of the Salzkammergut.

Lenzing&#x27;s economy is partly based on tourism, but the town is much more known as an industrial site; it is the world headquarters of Lenzing AG, which is the world leader in the production of cellulose-based fiber such as viscose and Lyocell. , it manufactures 17 percent of the world&#x27;s cellulose fiber.

== History ==
The area around Lake Attersee was inhabited as early as 6000 years ago during the Mondsee culture. This is also evidenced by finds made at Burgstall in the village of Unterachmann. From the Bronze Age, an arm spiral was found in Pichlwang, bowl head needles and fibulae in Pettighofen and an axe in Reibersdorf. Remains of buildings and coins from the Roman period were found on the present-day industrial site of the Lenzing AG, as well as clay urns in Gallaberg.

Originally located in the eastern part of the Duchy of Bavaria, the area of today&#x27;s Lenzing has been part of the Duchy of Austria since the 12th century.

The first documentary mention dates back to 773 and concerns the village of Pichlwang. In 1350, Arnbruck appears in the land register of Michaelbeuern Abbey, in 1371 Pettighofen in the land register of the Schaunberg estate. Lenzing is first mentioned in a document in 1389.

The local municipality of Lenzing was established in 1848, and in 1851 the parent municipality of Oberachmann was founded with 701 inhabitants. In 1891, the industrialist Emil Hamburger founded a paper factory in Pettighofen, a forerunner of today&#x27;s Lenzing AG.

Since 1918, the area has belonged to the newly founded federal state of Upper Austria.

After the annexation of Austria to the German Reich in 1938 the ‘Zellwolle Lenzing AG’ was founded. In 1939, the current municipality was founded from the parent municipality of Oberachmann and by transferring territory from neighbouring municipalities. On 1 January 1940, the name of the municipality was changed to ‘Agerzell’.

In November 1944, a satellite camp of the Mauthausen concentration camp was set up in the Lenzing district of Pettighofen. The up to 565 prisoners, mostly women, had to perform forced labour, particularly at Lenzinger Zellwolle AG. The camp was liberated by the US army at the beginning of May 1945.

Lenzing has been a market town since 1984.

== Lenzing Concentration Camp ==
In November 1944, the first transport of 500 women from Auschwitz came to Lenzing to work in the newly opened local subcamp of Mauthausen concentration camp which was located in the Lenzinger suburb of Pettighofen. Eventually 600 female prisoners, mainly Jewish women came to Lenzing from Auschwitz, and a few others came from Ravensbrück and the main camp at Mauthausen. The SS staff in the small subcamp included mainly SS men as well as a small contingent of SS women. Frau Schmidt served in her capacities as Lagerführerin, or female commandant. Her main boss was Mauthausen commandant Franz Ziereis who commanded all of the subcamps in Austria. Later Margarete Freinberger became an Oberaufseherin in the camp under Schmidt. Only one other female overseer is known today, Maria Kunik. Attitudes by the former guards was reported as arrogant and brutal, but not as horrible as in Mauthausen proper. The prisoners in the Lenzing camp worked for the Lenzing AG company making artificial wool. Many women in fact died from the work, and others perished in the Mauthausen gas chambers when they could no longer work. In the winter of January 1945, a group of prisoners were severely injured when a train carrying supplies to the camp derailed. The SS sent them, along with any other prisoners who could no longer work to Mauthausen where they were gassed. The women &quot;cried and wailed all the way to the main camp.&quot; In May 1945 the American Army neared the Lenzing camp. The SS staff fled after Lagerführerin Schmidt gave a speech to the surviving women as to not &quot;dishonor them&quot;. On 5 May 1945 the US Army liberated 565 women from the Lenzing subcamp.

<text>The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O&#x27;Neill is a 2004 book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Suskind. The book was the first to provide critical insight into the events that led up to the Iraq War. &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot; was met with both commercial and critical success, and was the first book by Suskind to be a #1 &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller.

==Overview ==
Published in early 2004, &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot; chronicled the tenure of Paul O&#x27;Neill as Treasury Secretary during the Bush Administration. Like all treasury secretaries, O&#x27;Neill was the top domestic advisor to the president, as well as a member of the pivotal National Security Council. The book featured over 19,000 documents provided by O&#x27;Neill from his first two years with the Bush Administration. Among the most damaging accusations in the book was that invasion of Iraq was on the agenda as early as February 2001, nearly seven months before the September 11 attacks.

==Reception==
The book was met with both commercial and critical success. It debuted as a number one bestseller on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Nonfiction Best Sellers of 2004 list on February 1, 2004.

O&#x27;Neill harshly criticizes the President, blasting his economic policies and alleged &quot;detachment&quot; from the cabinet process. He described Bush&#x27;s behavior at cabinet meetings as being like &quot;a blind man in a roomful of deaf people. There is no discernible connection.&quot;

O&#x27;Neill was frustrated about what he perceived to be a lack of vigorous debate between administration officials and the formation of sound, coherent policy on the important issues. He longed for the return of the &quot;Brandeis briefs&quot; that were used in the Nixon and Ford administrations in which he had previously worked.

The book also claims that the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was not a reaction to the attacks of September 11, but was instead a campaign in the planning stages ever since Bush took office, with potential oil spoils charted in early documents.

Rather than denying his allegations, Bush officials attacked O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s credibility, while answering that regime change in Iraq had been official U.S. policy since 1998, three years before Bush took office. However, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s claims called into question the relationship of the Iraq occupation to the post-9/11 War on Terrorism.

After documents containing classified information were shown during a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview in which O&#x27;Neill promoted the book, a Department of the Treasury investigation concluded in 2004 that no laws were violated, but that inadequate document handling policies at Treasury had allowed 140 documents, which should have been marked classified, to be entered into a computer system for unclassified documents. The documents were amongst those subsequently released to O&#x27;Neill in response to a legal document request.

Keith Hennessey, then a Deputy of NEC Director Larry Lindsey, stated that Suskind made up a paragraph long direct quote from him during a White House meeting that he never actually said.

==Experiment in transparency==
To confirm the validity of his sources, the following was posted on Ron Suskind&#x27;s official website.

<doc id="606612" wikidata="Q185449" url="?curid=606612" title="Eragon">
<text>Eragon is the first book in &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot; by American fantasy writer Christopher Paolini. Paolini, born in 1983, began writing the novel after graduating from home school at the age of fifteen. After writing the first draft for a year, Paolini spent a second year rewriting and fleshing out the story and characters. His parents saw the final manuscript and in 2001 decided to self-publish &quot;Eragon&quot;; Paolini spent a year traveling around the United States promoting the novel. The book was discovered by novelist Carl Hiaasen, who brought it to the attention of Alfred A. Knopf. The re-published version was released on August 26, 2003.

The book tells the story of a farm boy named Eragon, who finds a mysterious stone in the mountains. The stone is revealed to be a dragon egg, and a dragon whose name is Saphira hatches from it. When the evil King Galbatorix finds out about the egg, he sends monstrous servants to acquire it, making Eragon and Saphira flee from their hometown with a storyteller named Brom. Brom, an old member of an extinct group of Dragon Riders, teaches Eragon about the ways of the Rider.

&quot;Eragon&quot; was the third-best-selling children&#x27;s hardback book of 2003, and the second-best-selling paperback of 2005. It placed on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Children&#x27;s Books Best Seller list for 121 weeks and was adapted as a feature film of the same name that was released on December 15, 2006.

==Background==

=== Origins and publication ===
Christopher Paolini started reading fantasy books when he was 10 years old. At the age of 14, as a hobby, he started writing a novel, endeavoring to create the sort of fantasy story that he himself would enjoy reading. However, he could not get beyond a few pages because he had &quot;no idea&quot; where he was going. He began reading everything he could about the &quot;art of writing&quot;, and then plotted the whole &quot;Inheritance Cycle&quot; book series. After a month of planning out the series, he started writing the draft of &quot;Eragon&quot; by hand. It was finished a year later, and Paolini began writing the second draft of the book. After another year of editing, Paolini&#x27;s parents saw the final manuscript. They immediately saw its potential and decided to publish the book through their small, home-based publishing company, Paolini International. Paolini created the cover art for this edition of &quot;Eragon&quot;, which featured Saphira&#x27;s eye on the cover. He also drew the maps inside the book.

Paolini and his family toured across the United States promoting the book. He gave over 135 talks at bookshops, libraries, and schools, many with Paolini dressed up in a medieval costume; but the book did not receive much attention. Paolini said he &quot;would stand behind a table in (his) costume talking all day without a break – and would sell maybe forty books in eight hours if (he) did really well. [...] It was a very stressful experience. (He) couldn&#x27;t have gone on for very much longer.&quot; In the summer of 2002, American novelist Carl Hiaasen was on vacation in one of the cities that Paolini gave a talk in. While there, Hiaasen&#x27;s stepson bought a copy of &quot;Eragon&quot; that he &quot;immediately loved&quot;. He showed it to Hiaasen, who brought the book to the attention of the publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, contacted Paolini and his family to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish &quot;Eragon&quot;. The answer was yes, and after another round of editing, Knopf published &quot;Eragon&quot; in August 2003, with a new cover, drawn by John Jude Palencar.

=== Inspiration and influences ===

Paolini cites old myths, folk tales, medieval stories, the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and authors J. R. R. Tolkien and E. R. Eddison as his biggest influences in writing. Other literary influences include David Eddings, Andre Norton, Brian Jacques, Anne McCaffrey, Raymond E. Feist, Mervyn Peake, Ursula K. Le Guin, Frank Herbert, Philip Pullman, and Garth Nix.

The ancient language used by the elves in &quot;Eragon&quot; is based &quot;almost entirely&quot; on Old Norse, German, Anglo Saxon, and Russian myth. Paolini commented: &quot;[I] did a god-awful amount of research into the subject when I was composing it. I found that it gave the world a much richer feel, a much older feel, using these words that had been around for centuries and centuries. I had a lot of fun with that.&quot; Picking the right names for the characters and places was a process that could take &quot;days, weeks, or even years&quot;. Paolini said: &quot;if I have difficulty choosing the correct moniker, I use a placeholder name until a replacement suggests itself.&quot; He added that he was &quot;really lucky&quot; with the name Eragon, &quot;because it&#x27;s just dragon with one letter changed.&quot; Also, Paolini commented that he thought of both parts of the name &quot;Eragon&quot;—&quot;era&quot; and &quot;gone&quot;—as if the name itself changes the era in which the character lives. He thought the name fit the book perfectly, but some of the other names caused him &quot;real headaches&quot;.

The landscape in &quot;Eragon&quot; is based on the &quot;wild territory&quot; of Paolini&#x27;s home state, Montana. He said in an interview: &quot;I go hiking a lot, and oftentimes when I&#x27;m in the forest or in the mountains, sitting down and seeing some of those little details makes the difference between having an okay description and having a unique description.&quot; Paolini also said that Paradise Valley, Montana is &quot;one of the main sources&quot; of his inspiration for the landscape in the book (&quot;Eragon&quot; takes place in the fictional continent Alagaësia). Paolini &quot;roughed out&quot; the main history of the land before he wrote the book, but he did not draw a map of it until it became important to see where Eragon was traveling. He then started to get history and plot ideas from seeing the landscape depicted.

Paolini chose to have Eragon mature throughout the book because, &quot;for one thing, it&#x27;s one of the archetypal fantasy elements&quot;. He thought Eragon&#x27;s growth and maturation throughout the book &quot;sort of mirrored my own growing abilities as a writer and as a person, too. So it was a very personal choice for that book.&quot; Eragon&#x27;s dragon, Saphira, was imagined as &quot;the perfect friend&quot; by Paolini. He decided to go in a more &quot;human direction&quot; with her because she is raised away from her own species, in &quot;close mental contact&quot; with a human. &quot;I considered making the dragon more dragon-like, if you will, in its own society, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to explore that. I went with a more human element with Saphira while still trying to get a bit of the magic, the alien, of her race.&quot; Paolini made Saphira the &quot;best friend anyone could have: loyal, funny, brave, intelligent, and noble. She transcended that, however, and became her own person, fiercely independent and proud.&quot; Saphira&#x27;s blue tinted vision was in turn inspired by Paolini&#x27;s own color-blindness.

Paolini deliberately included archetypal elements of a fantasy novel like a quest, a journey of experience, revenge, romance, betrayal, and a unique sword. The book is described as a fantasy, and &quot;Booklist&quot; observed: &quot;Paolini knows the genre well—his lush tale is full of recognizable fantasy elements and conventions&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called the book a &quot;high fantasy&quot;; other reviewers have compared it to other books and films of the fantasy genre, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and in some instances stated &quot;Eragon&quot;″s plot is too similar to those other stories.

== Plot summary ==

A Shade named Durza, along with a group of Urgals, ambushes a party of three elves. They kill two of them, and Durza attempts to steal an egg carried by the remaining female elf. However, she manages to use magic to teleport it elsewhere. Infuriated, Durza abducts her and keeps her prisoner at the city of Gil&#x27;ead.

Eragon is a fifteen-year-old boy who has lived with his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran on a farm near the village of Carvahall, left by his mother 15 years before. While hunting, he sees a large explosion and finds a blue dragon egg in the rubble. Later on, a baby dragon hatches from the egg, and bonds with Eragon, giving him a silver mark on his hand. Eragon names the dragon Saphira, after a name the old village storyteller Brom mentions.

He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix&#x27;s servants, the Ra&#x27;zac, come to Carvahall. Eragon and Saphira escape and hide in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the farm is burned down by the Ra&#x27;zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon and Saphira decide to hunt the Ra&#x27;zac, in vengeance. Brom insists on accompanying him and Saphira, and gives Eragon the sword Zar&#x27;roc.

Eragon becomes a Dragon Rider, through his bond with Saphira. He is the only known Rider in Alagaësia other than King Galbatorix, who, with the help of the now-dead Forsworn, a group of rogue Riders, killed every other Rider a century ago. As they travel, Brom teaches Eragon sword fighting, magic, the ancient elvish language, and the ways of the Dragon Riders.

They travel to the city of Teirm, where they meet with Brom&#x27;s friend Jeod. Eragon&#x27;s fortune is told by the witch Angela, and her companion, the werecat Solembum, gives Eragon mysterious advice. With Jeod&#x27;s help, they track the Ra&#x27;zac to the city of Dras-Leona. They manage to infiltrate the city, but are forced to flee after a run-in with the Ra&#x27;zac. That night, they are ambushed by the Ra&#x27;zac. A stranger named Murtagh rescues them, but Brom is mortally wounded. Brom gives Eragon his blessing, reveals that he was once a Dragon Rider, with a dragon named Saphira, and dies. Saphira uses magic to encase Brom in a diamond tomb.

Murtagh becomes Eragon&#x27;s new companion and they travel to the city of Gil&#x27;ead, seeking information on how to find the Varden, a group of rebels who seek the downfall of Galbatorix. Near Gil&#x27;ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in a jail that holds a female elf he had had recurring dreams about. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon takes the unconscious elf with him. After fighting Durza, Murtagh seemingly kills him with an arrow shot through his head, and they escape. Eragon telepathically communicates with the elf, named Arya, who reveals she had sent the egg to him accidentally. From her, he learns the location of the Varden. Murtagh is reluctant to journey to the Varden, revealing that he is the son of Morzan, former leader of the Forsworn.

An army of Kull, elite Urgals, chases Eragon to the Varden&#x27;s headquarters, but is driven off by the Varden, who escort Eragon, Saphira, Murtagh, and Arya to Farthen Dûr, their mountain hideout. Eragon meets the leader of the Varden, Ajihad. Ajihad imprisons Murtagh after he refuses to allow his mind to be read, to determine his allegiance. Eragon is told by Ajihad that Murtagh failed to kill Durza, as the only way to kill a Shade is with a stab through the heart. Orik, nephew of the dwarf King Hrothgar, is appointed as Eragon and Saphira&#x27;s guide. Eragon also meets Ajihad&#x27;s daughter, Nasuada, and Ajihad&#x27;s right-hand man, Jörmundur. He runs into Angela and Solembum again, and visits Murtagh in prison. He is tested by two magicians, The Twins, as well as Arya.

Eragon and the Varden are then attacked by an immense Urgal army. Eragon personally battles Durza again, and, after a mental battle, is overwhelmed by Durza, who slashes him across the back. Arya and Saphira shatter Isidar Mithrim, a large sapphire that formed the roof of the chamber, to distract Durza, allowing Eragon to stab him through the heart with his sword. He falls into a coma, and is visited telepathically by a stranger, who tells Eragon to visit him in the Elven capital, Ellesméra. He wakes up with a scar across his back, and resolves to journey to Ellesméra.

== Reception ==
&quot;Eragon&quot; received generally mixed reviews and was criticized for its derivative nature. Liz Rosenberg of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; criticized &quot;Eragon&quot; for having &quot;clichéd descriptions&quot;, &quot;B-movie dialogue&quot;, &quot;awkward and gangly prose&quot;. However, she concluded the review by noting that &quot;for all its flaws, it is an authentic work of great talent.&quot; &quot;School Library Journal&quot; wrote that in &quot;Eragon&quot; &quot;sometimes the magic solutions are just too convenient for getting out of difficult situations.&quot; Common Sense Media called &quot;Eragon&quot; dialogue &quot;long-winded&quot; and &quot;clichéd&quot;, with a plot &quot;straight out of &quot;Star Wars&quot; by way of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, with bits of other great fantasies thrown in here and there...&quot; The website did concede that the book is a notable achievement for such a young author, and that it would be &quot;appreciated&quot; by younger fans.

Favorable reviews of &quot;Eragon&quot; often focused on the book&#x27;s characters and plot. IGN&#x27;s Matt Casamassina called the book &quot;entertaining&quot;, and added that &quot;Paolini demonstrates that he understands how to hold the reader&#x27;s eyes and this is what ultimately separates &quot;Eragon&quot; from countless other me-too fantasy novels.&quot; Chris Lawrence of About.com thought the book had all the &quot;traditional ingredients&quot; that make a fantasy novel &quot;enjoyable&quot;. The book was a &quot;fun read&quot; for him because it is &quot;quick and exciting&quot; and &quot;packed&quot; with action and magic. Lawrence concluded his review by giving the book a rating of 3.8/5, commenting that &quot;the characters are interesting, the plot is engrossing, and you know the good guy will win in the end.&quot;

&quot;Eragon&quot; was the third best-selling children&#x27;s hardback book of 2003, and the second best-selling children&#x27;s paperback of 2005. It placed on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Children&#x27;s Books Best Seller list for 121 weeks. In 2006, the novel was awarded with a Nene Award by the children of Hawaii. It won the Rebecca Caudill Young Reader&#x27;s Book Award and the Young Reader&#x27;s Choice Award the same year.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film ===
A film adaptation of &quot;Eragon&quot; was released in the United States on December 15, 2006. Plans to create the film were first announced in February 2004, when 20th Century Fox purchased the rights to &quot;Eragon&quot;. The film was directed by first-timer Stefen Fangmeier, and written by Peter Buchman. Edward Speleers was selected for the role of Eragon. Over the following months, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Chris Egan and Djimon Hounsou were all confirmed as joining the cast. Principal photography for the film took place in Hungary and Slovakia.

The film received mostly negative reviews, garnering a 16% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes; the tenth worst of 2006. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; described it as &quot;technically accomplished, but fairly lifeless and at times a bit silly&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said the world of &quot;Eragon&quot; was &quot;without much texture or depth&quot;. The story was labelled &quot;derivative&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;generic&quot; by the &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot;.
&quot;Newsday&quot; stressed this point further, asserting that only &quot;nine-year-olds with no knowledge whatsoever of any of the six &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies&quot; would find the film original.
The acting was called &quot;lame&quot; by the &quot;Washington Post,&quot; as well as &quot;stilted&quot; and &quot;lifeless&quot; by the &quot;Orlando Weekly&quot;. The dialogue was also criticized: MSNBC labelled it &quot;silly&quot;; the &quot;Las Vegas Weekly&quot; called it &quot;wooden&quot;. Positive reviews described the film as &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;the stuff boys&#x27; fantasies are made of&quot;. The CGI work was called &quot;imaginative&quot; and Saphira was called a &quot;magnificent creation&quot;. Paolini stated he enjoyed the film, particularly praising the performances of Jeremy Irons and Ed Speleers.

&quot;Eragon&quot; grossed approximately $75 million in the United States and $173.9 million elsewhere, totaling $249 million worldwide. It is the fifth highest-grossing film with a dragon at its focal point, and the sixth highest-grossing film of the sword and sorcery subgenre. &quot;Eragon&quot; was in release for seventeen weeks in the United States, opening on December 15, 2006, and closing on April 9, 2007. It opened in 3,020 theaters, earning $8.7 million on opening day and $23.2 million across opening weekend, ranking second behind &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot;. Eragon&#x27;s $75 million total United States gross was the thirty-first highest for 2006. The film earned $150 million in its opening weekend across 76 overseas markets, making it the #1 film worldwide. The film&#x27;s $249 million total worldwide gross was the sixteenth highest for 2006.

=== Television series ===
In June 2021, Christopher Paolini tweeted #EragonRemake in an effort to get Disney, the intellectual rights holders following their acquisition of 21st Century Fox, to revamp the book series into a possible television show for Disney+. Within hours, the hashtag began to trend with fans pushing for a proper adaptation. On July 25, 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that a live action television series adaptation of &quot;Eragon&quot; was in early development for Disney+, with Paolini serving as a co-writer on the series, and with Bert Salke executive producing.

=== Video game ===

A video game adaptation of &quot;Eragon&quot; based primarily on the film, released in North America on November 14, 2006. The game is a third-person video game released for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, developed by Stormfront Studios.
