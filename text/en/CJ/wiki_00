<text>William Gifford (April 1756 – 31 December 1826) was an English critic, editor and poet, famous as a satirist and controversialist.

==Life==
Gifford was born in Ashburton, Devon, to Edward Gifford and Elizabeth Cain. His father, a glazier and house painter, had run away as a youth with vagabond Bampfylde Moore Carew, and he remained a carouser throughout his life. He died when William was thirteen; his mother died less than a year later. He was left in the care of a godfather who treated him with little consistency. Gifford was sent in turn to work as a plough boy, a ship&#x27;s boy, student, and cobbler&#x27;s apprentice. Of these, Gifford cared only for the life of a student, and he continued to write verses as he learned the cobbler&#x27;s trade. Gifford&#x27;s fortunes changed when his first poetical efforts came to the attention of an Ashburton surgeon, William Cookesley. Cookesley raised a subscription to have the boy&#x27;s apprenticeship bought out, and he returned to school.

By 1779 he had entered Exeter College, Oxford as a bible clerk (that is, a servitor), matriculating on 16 February 1779 and graduating B.A. 10 October 1782. Already while at Oxford, he had begun work on his translation of Juvenal. After graduation, he earned the patronage of Lord Grosvenor. He spent most of the ensuing decade as tutor to Grosvenor&#x27;s son. In course of time he produced his first poem, &quot;The Baviad&quot; (1791), a satire directed against the Della Cruscans, a group of sentimental and to Gifford&#x27;s conservative mentality dangerously radical poets. &quot;The Baviad&quot; is a &#x27;paraphrastic&#x27; (that is, according to the OED, a work having &#x27;the nature of a paraphrase&#x27;) &#x27;imitation&#x27; of the first satire of the Roman poet Persius (34–62 A.D.). Persius&#x27;s satire deals with the degenerate state of contemporary literature. Both literature and literary taste have become corrupt, and for him as for Gifford, poetic corruption mirrors political corruption: the decline in modern poetry reflects the decline of modern morals.

&quot;The Baviad&quot; was followed by another satire, &quot;The Maeviad&quot; (1795), against some minor dramatists. His last effort in this line was his &quot;Epistle to Peter Pindar&quot; (Dr. John Wolcot) (1800), inspired by personal enmity, which evoked a reply, &quot;A Cut at a Cobbler&quot; and a public letter in which Wolcot threatened to horse-whip Gifford. Gifford and Wolcot met in Wright&#x27;s bookshop in Piccadilly on 18 August 1800. According to most contemporary accounts, Wolcot attempted to cudgel Gifford; however, the diminutive but younger satirist wrested his stick from him and proceeded to lay about Wolcot, forcing him to flee down Piccadilly.

The earlier satirical writings had established Gifford as a keen, even ferocious critic, and he was appointed in 1797 editor of the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot;, which Canning and his friends had just started, and later of the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; (1809–24). As editor of the Anti-Jacobin, Gifford published the pro-Tory satires and parodies of George Canning, John Hookham Frere, and George Ellis. Gifford edited &quot;The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin&quot; in 1799.

By the turn of the century, Gifford&#x27;s efforts as a poet were all but over, and he spent the rest of his career as an editor, scholar, and occasional critic. From 1809 to 1824, he edited the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;; in this capacity, he became an icon of Tory journalism. Though he contributed rarely, his style marked the periodical in all respects. Gifford was popularly supposed to have penned the attack on Keats&#x27;s &#x27;Endymion&#x27; (the review was actually by John Wilson Croker), which Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron erroneously blamed for bringing about the death of the poet, &#x27;snuffed out&#x27;, in Byron&#x27;s phrase, &#x27;by an article&#x27;. Contributors to the review included Charles Lamb, Walter Scott, and Robert Southey; the last had been among the poets satirised in the previous decade by the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot;.

His work as translator and editor was only slightly less contentious than his work as editor. The translation of Juvenal, published in 1800 earned high praise. Even William Hazlitt, elsewhere a frank enemy, praised the preface, in which Gifford describes his difficult childhood. This edition remained in print for the next century. Near the end of his life, he produced a translation of Persius. As an editor, Gifford shared the age&#x27;s interest in Renaissance drama. He brought out editions of Massinger, Ben Jonson, and Ford.

Gifford gave up the editorship of the &quot;Quarterly&quot; in 1824, only two years before his own death; he was succeeded in that position by John Taylor Coleridge. John Gibson Lockhart took over in 1826.

Gifford never married, although he had a close, probably Platonic, relationship with Ann Davies, a servant; she died in 1815. His salary with the review amounted to nine hundred pounds a year by 1818, and his friendship with various wealthy Tories further insulated him from want. Indeed, when he died his will was proved at 25,000 pounds, the majority of which he bequeathed to the son of Cookesley, his first benefactor.

==Work==
As a poet, Gifford is commonly judged to have reached his peak with the &quot;Baviad&quot;. In this work, which led to the more or less complete eclipse of the Della Cruscans, his lifelong tendency to unmoderated invective was restrained (though not completely) to produce a work that effectively satirised the Della Cruscan&#x27;s sentimentality and tendency to absurd mutual compliment. In later work, his interest in vituperation is judged to have overwhelmed any element of wit. Still, Byron named him the best of the age&#x27;s satirists. His satires are in heroic couplets after the manner of Alexander Pope; assorted other verse, little of it memorable, adopts the highly mannered style of the late eighteenth century.

As a critic he had acuteness; but he was one-sided, prejudiced, and savagely bitter, and much more influenced in his judgments by the political opinions than by the literary merits of his victims. These were traits he shared with his querulous and factional time; however, Gifford was among the most virulent practitioners of the art of partisan review. As an editor, he played an important role in the revival of Jonson&#x27;s reputation after a period of neglect.

His satirical poems are included in volume 4 of British Satire 1785–1840, 5 vols (2003), ed. John Strachan. The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin was edited by Graeme Stones in 1999 (Pickering and Chatto). Everyman publishes Gifford&#x27;s Juvenal.

Kathryn Sutherland, professor of the Faculty of English Language and Literature at Oxford University, has studied the manuscript of a discarded chapter of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Persuasion&quot; and has conjectured that much of Austen&#x27;s polished style is probably the result of editorial tidying by Gifford, who worked for the publisher John Murray. There is no direct evidence that Gifford edited the work, however.

<text>The agencies of the European Union (formally: &quot;Agencies, decentralised independent bodies, corporate bodies and joint undertakings of the European Union and Euratom&quot;) are bodies of the European Union and Euratom established as juridical persons through secondary EU legislation and tasked with a specific narrow field of work.

They are distinct from:
* international law juridical persons established through primary (treaty) legislation, either as an EU institution (the European Central Bank) or an EU body of other type (such as the European Investment Bank Group entities, the European University Institute, the European Stability Mechanism or the Unified Patent Court)
* other EU institutions
* other EU bodies lacking juridical personality, including the advisory bodies, the independent offices held by a single person (European Ombudsman, European Data Protection Supervisor), and the (non-independent, auxiliary) EU inter-institutional services, regardless whether established through treaty or secondary legislation
* the pan-EU organisational forms which are not considered constituent bodies of the EU or Euratom, regardless whether possessing juridical personality (European Research Infrastructure Consortium, European political party, European political foundation, European grouping of territorial cooperation, , ) or lacking it (European economic interest grouping)

==Overview==
In contrast to other EU bodies established through secondary legislation, each of more than fifty such entities has its own juridical personality granted by the EU law, recognised across the EU, and in some cases, also across the EEA countries, Switzerland, Serbia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and Turkey. Nevertheless, in relations with other non-EU third countries, they are in general not recognised as independent entities, thus being considered either parts of the juridical personality of the EU or Euratom.

Some of the agencies, decentralised independent bodies and joint undertakings of the European Union and Euratom are tasked with answering the need to develop scientific or technical know-how in certain fields, others bring together different interest groups to facilitate dialogue at European and international level.

==Existing agencies==
They are divided into the following groups:

===Decentralised agencies of the EU===
Distinct from the EU institutions, the agencies of the European Union are specialist bodies set up to advise the Institutions and Member States in areas that affect everyone living in the Union. They are located in member states across the EU, providing services, information, and know-how. The total budget of all the decentralised agencies is approximately 0.8% of the EU&#x27;s annual budget.

====Single market agencies====
Single market agencies (under the former I Pillar)
====Area of freedom, security and justice agencies====
Area of freedom, security and justice agencies (under the former III Pillar)
===European supervisory authorities===
European supervisory authorities (of the European System of Financial Supervision)
===Banking union (Single Resolution Mechanism) bodies===
Single Resolution Mechanism bodies (of the European banking union)
===Common Security and Defence Policy agencies===
Common Security and Defence Policy agencies (under the former II Pillar)
===Executive agencies of the EU===
Executive agencies are created by European Commission for a fixed period.

===Euratom agencies===
==Joint undertakings==
A joint undertaking is a juridical person and a subsidiary body of the EU or Euratom, established through an agreement between the European Commission, the participating member states, and the European industry of a certain field, with the purpose of implementing a public-private partnership project.

===of the European Union===

===of Euratom===
==Independent secondary-legislation bodies==
===Decentralised===
The list includes the two decentralised bodies other than agencies, established as EU juridical persons through secondary legislation of the EU/Euratom.
===Other===
The list includes the remaining two bodies other than agencies, decentralised bodies or joint undertakings, established as EU juridical persons through secondary legislation of the EU/Euratom.
==Non-existing decentralised bodies==
===Proposed and abandoned===
===Transformed or dissolved===
====Agencies====
====Euratom joint undertakings====

<text>Richard Watson Gilder (February 8, 1844 – November 19, 1909) was an American poet and editor.

==Life and career==

Gilder was born on February 8, 1844 at Bordentown, New Jersey. He was the son of Jane (Nutt) Gilder and the Rev. William Henry Gilder, and educated at his father&#x27;s seminary in Flushing, Queens. There he learned to set type and published the &quot;St. Thomas Register&quot;. Gilder later studied law at Philadelphia.

During the American Civil War, he enlisted in the state&#x27;s Emergency Volunteer Militia as a private in Landis&#x27; Philadelphia Battery at the time of the Robert E. Lee&#x27;s 1863 invasion of Pennsylvania. After the Confederates were defeated in the Battle of Gettysburg, Gilder and his unit were mustered out in August. The death of his father, while serving as chaplain of the Fortieth New York Volunteers, obliged him to give up the study of the law.

A little later, he became a reporter on the Newark (New Jersey) &quot;Advertiser&quot;, of which he was later editor. With Newton Crane, he founded the Newark &quot;Register&quot;. In 1870, he became editor of &quot;Hours at Home&quot;, a monthly magazine published by Scribner&#x27;s. It merged with &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, which was edited by J. G. Holland. Gilder became managing editor. When Holland died in 1881, Gilder became editor. In November 1881, the monthly was renamed as &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, and Gilder remained its editor until his death. Gilder&#x27;s assistant editor at &quot;Century&quot; was Sophia Bledsoe Herrick. Under Gilder&#x27;s editorship, &quot;The Century&quot; became one of the most esteemed periodicals in the country and Gilder himself became influential enough that his biographer Herbert Smith referred to the 1880s as &quot;the Gilder Age&quot;. He published the works of William Dean Howells, Henry James, Mark Twain, and Walt Whitman

Gilder took an active interest in all public affairs, especially those which tend towards reform and good government, and was a member of many New York clubs. He was one of the founders of the Society of American Architects, of the Authors&#x27; Club, and of the International Copyright League. He was a founder of the Anti-Spoils League and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was a close friend of George MacDonald, Scottish poet, author, and preacher. They collaborated in various ventures such as MacDonald&#x27;s American lecture tour in the 1870s. Gilder received the degree of LL.D. from Dickinson College in 1883.

As editor of &quot;Century&quot; Gilder editorialized against women&#x27;s suffrage. He wrote that giving women the right to vote would destroy the &quot;home woman&quot; who was an anchor of family stability in a changing world. He regarded women as guardians of the nation&#x27;s morality, and excluded anything from the magazine that would &quot;corrupt&quot; women.

Gilder was a member of the Simplified Spelling Board. He was a leader in the organization of the Citizens&#x27; Union, a founder and the first president of the Kindergarten Association, and of the New York Association for the Blind. Gilder was chairman of the first Tenement House Commission in New York City. During his service on the commission, he arranged to be called whenever there was a fire in a tenement house, and at all hours of the night he risked his health and his life itself to see the perils besetting the dwellers of the tenements, in order to make wise recommendations as to legislation that would minimize these perils.

==Family==

On June 3, 1874, Gilder married a daughter of Commodore George Coleman De Kay, Helena de Kay Gilder (1846–1916). Gilder met her in May 1872 while she was visiting the offices of Scribner&#x27;s Monthly, where he was at the time working as an editor. About a year and a half later, in February 1874, Helena and Richard became engaged. They are known to have kept a lengthy correspondence with each other via letter over the course of their marriage. Helena de Kay Gilder is also known to be the subject of love poems written by Richard Watson Gilder, and they partnered together on some of his books, with her working as the illustrator, such as in &quot;Two Worlds and Other Poems&quot; (1891). She was a talented painter and a founder of the Art Students League and Society of American Artists. She also modeled for, and was an unrequited love of, the painter Winslow Homer. Gilder and de Kay were the models for the characters Thomas and Augusta Hudson in Wallace Stegner&#x27;s Pulitzer-prize winning novel, &quot;Angle of Repose&quot;. Their son, Rodman de Kay Gilder (1877–1953), became an author and married Louise Comfort Tiffany, a daughter of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Their daughter, Rosamond Gilder, was a notable theater critic. A celebrated plaster sculpture of the family by Augustus Saint-Gaudens is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Berkshires summer home of Helena de Kay and Richard Watson Gilder is being turned into a museum.
Gilder&#x27;s siblings were William Henry Gilder, an explorer; Jeannette Leonard Gilder, a journalist; and Joseph Benson Gilder, an editor. His great-grandson George Gilder is a renowned author and was a speechwriter for Richard Nixon. 

Frank Weitenkampf recounts the following anecdote of Gilder and Alexander Wilson Drake:

:Drake and some friends, late one Christmas Eve (or was it Thanksgiving?), wandering down the Bowery, came across a turkey raffle. They took chances, and won the bird, a large, live specimen. What to do with it? One of the party had a happy idea. Off they marched to Gilder&#x27;s house, rang up the butler, and persuaded him to let them tie the bird to a large chair in the front room. Drake continued the story to the effect that Gilder early next morning was aroused by a terrific racket, rushed downstairs, and found the children hilariously dancing around the turkey, whose excited gobbling added to the din.

==Death==
Gilder died suddenly in New York City on Friday 19 November 1909 of a heart attack in the home of Schuyler van Rensselaer
(at 9 West 10th St). 

The cause of death is considered to be heart disease.
He had been staying at the Rensselaer home as a guest for several days (since the previous Monday, 15 November 1909) with his wife (Helena) when he suddenly died.
He had been ill two weeks prior to his death, while he had been giving a lecture, but the incident was not considered to be serious at the time.

Gilder is buried at the Bordentown Cemetery in Bordentown New Jersey.

Following his death, he was remembered by Theodore Roosevelt as:
:one of the truest, stanchest, and most delightful of friends, and one of the best of citizens. He combined to a singular degree sweetness and courage, idealism and wholesome common sense. It may be truthfully said that he was an ideal citizen for such democracy as ours. He was a man of letters; he was a lover of his kind who worked in a practical fashion for the betterment of social and economic conditions, and he took keen and effective interest in our public life. No worthier American citizen has lived during our time.

<text>The Scarab Murder Case (1930) is a classic whodunit written by S. S. Van Dine. In this book, detective Philo Vance&#x27;s murder investigation takes place in a private home that doubles as a museum of Egyptology, and the solution depends in part on Vance&#x27;s extensive knowledge of Egyptian history and customs, which enable him to sort through suggestions of godly vengeance and reveal the misdirections perpetrated by the real murderer.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Some reviewers &quot;were disgusted by the author&#x27;s bland insults to the reader&#x27;s intelligence -- e.g., the heavy Egyptian statue in the gallery, upended on a piece of pencil and conveniently toppling on the designed victim. By that date they were fed up with the whole bag of tricks, which successive settings did not rejuvenate.&quot;

==Film adaptation==
&quot;The Scarab Murder Case&quot; (1936) starred Wilfrid Hyde-White as Vance.

<doc id="1078439" wikidata="Q2959213" url="?curid=1078439" title="Charles Gildon">
<text>Charles Gildon (c. 1665 – 1 January 1724), was an English hack writer and translator. He produced biographies, essays, plays, poetry, fictional letters, fables, short stories, and criticism. He is remembered best as a target of Alexander Pope in Pope&#x27;s &quot;Dunciad&quot; and his &quot;Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot&quot; and as an enemy of Jonathan Swift. Due to Pope&#x27;s caricature of Gildon as well as the volume and rapidity of his writings, Gildon has become the epitome of the hired pen and literary opportunist.

He is a literary source for many biographies of Restoration figures, although he appears to have propagated or introduced errors. Gildon&#x27;s biographies are often the only biographies available, but they have often been shown to have invention in them.

==Early life==
Gildon was born in Gillingham, Dorset to a Roman Catholic family that had been active in support of the Royalist side during the English Civil War. While one of Charles&#x27;s cousins, Joseph, would become a Catholic priest, Charles&#x27;s parents fled to France, and Charles was educated at Douai. He left college without ordination and moved to England in 1684, at the age of 19. Two years later, he moved to London, where he immediately spent or lost his patrimony. Two years after that, in 1688, he married a woman without money. He almost immediately turned to writing as a method of getting money.

==Career==
His first known literary employer was John Dunton, who used Gildon for &quot;The Athenian Mercury&quot; and to write &quot;The History of the Athenian Society&quot; in 1692. In the same year, Gildon wrote a biography of Aphra Behn, claiming to have been her close friend. Inasmuch as he and Behn were both probably royalists from Dorset (although only Gildon&#x27;s family had been active during the Interregnum, whereas Behn was probably a Cavalier spy), it is possible that Gildon did know and seek out Behn, but his account of her life has many errors (including a credulous reading of &quot;Oroonoko&quot;). At the time, he was a social correspondent with John Dryden and William Wycherley, as well as Behn. He was a Deist in the mid 1690s. 

In 1693, Gildon edited and published &quot;The Oracles of Reason&quot;. This book is a collection of Deist writings supplied by Charles Blount. It comprises a &quot;Preface&quot; by Gildon, Blount&#x27;s &quot;Vindication of Dr. Burnet&quot;, an English translation by &quot;H. B.&quot; of three sections of Thomas Burnet&#x27;s &quot;Archaeologiae Philosophicae&quot;, Blount&#x27;s &quot;Summary Account of the Deists Religion&quot;, and several letters (tracts) prepared by Blount, Gildon, and other writers. In 1695, Gildon republished &quot;The Oracles of Reason&quot; in his collection of &quot;The Miscellaneous Works of Charles Blount&quot;. Writing as &quot;Lindamour&quot;, Gildon prefaced this new collection with an invented letter &quot;To the Honorable and Divine Hermione. Giving an account of the Life and Death of the Author.&quot;, also known as Gildon&#x27;s hagiographic &quot;Life of Blount&quot;.

In 1694, in response to Thomas Rymer&#x27;s recently published criticisms of Shakespeare and other &#x27;modern&#x27; plays and their authors, Goldin presented a defense of the modernism of John Dryden and John Dennis.

Between 1696 and 1702, Gildon wrote four blank verse tragedies that failed. He converted to Anglicanism in 1698 and wrote &quot;The Deist&#x27;s Manual&quot; (1705) to attack Deism. He produced a series of tales, including &quot;The Post-Boy Robb&#x27;d of his Mail&quot;, &quot;The Golden Spy,&quot; and &quot;All for the Better&quot; between 1692 and 1720.

Gildon&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Spy&quot; (1709) has been regarded by modern scholars as &quot;the first, fully-fledged it-narrative in English&quot;. But for his contemporaries, it tends to be read as &quot;a Menippean satire, a re-adaptation of Apuleius&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; and a sequel to &quot;The New Metamorphosis&quot; [i.e. Gildon&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; in 1708]&quot;.

In 1706, Gildon, a staunch Whig by then (in contrast to his family&#x27;s Toryism and Jacobitism), published letters to the Electress Sophia to come visit England, with an eye toward being on hand to take the throne upon Queen Anne&#x27;s death. The government prosecuted him for seditious libel. Prominent Whigs came to his aid, and Richard Steele wrote his appeal. When Gildon was found guilty and fined 100 pounds, Arthur Mainwaring paid his fine. The letters were sufficient provocation to carry a prison term or the pillory, but Gildon&#x27;s connections saved him.

Arthur Mainwaring, an enemy already of Jonathan Swift&#x27;s, aided Gildon again, and Steele introduced him to other periodical work. Gildon&#x27;s 1710 &quot;Life of Thomas Betterton&quot; was dedicated to Steele in return.

Gildon&#x27;s essay on &quot;The Art of Poetry&quot; was published anonymously in John Brightland&#x27;s &quot;A Grammar of the English Tongue&quot;, which was first published in 1711; Gildon later expanded this essay into his book &quot;The Complete Art of Poetry&quot; in 1718. Brightland&#x27;s &quot;Grammar&quot; also included Gildon&#x27;s treatise on &quot;Logic; or, The Art of Reasoning&quot;. Gildon&#x27;s &quot;Logic&quot; is an unattributed translation of a large part of Jean Le Clerc&#x27;s &quot;Logica&quot; of 1692. Much of Gildon&#x27;s translation of Le Clerc was appropriated by Ephraim Chambers when Chambers composed his &quot;Cyclopaedia&quot;.

In 1711, John Brightland hired Gildon to run &quot;The British Mercury.&quot; For six months, Gildon conducted attacks on Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. He attacked Swift for Swift&#x27;s enmity with Mainwaring, and his quarrel with Pope was probably similarly political. After &quot;The British Mercury&quot; folded, he launched another attack on Pope in a play called &quot;A New Rehearsal&quot; (1714) and in the body of &quot;Memoirs of the Life of William Wycherley&quot; (one of Pope&#x27;s mentors) in 1718. Gildon switched literary sides in &quot;Complete Art of Poetry,&quot; which he dedicated to the Duchess of Buckingham. In it, he reiterated Rymer&#x27;s dicta of neo-classicism, which he had disapproved of earlier in his career, with Dryden.

Gildon is involved with the biographies of women writers. He is assumed to be the biographer who masqueraded as &quot;One of the Fair Sex&quot; of &quot;Memoirs on the Life of Mrs. Behn&quot; which appears at the beginning of the first edition of &quot;The Histories and Novels or the Late Ingenious Mrs. Behn&quot; (1696). Gildon wrote two sheets of Mrs. Manley&#x27;s life under the title of The History of Rivella, Author of the Atalantis, probably in a negative light. Delarivier Manley persuaded the publisher Edmund Curll to defer the publication; soon Manley met and reconciled with Gildon to suppress his materials. Then Manley wrote her own version of history under strict time constraints and published it anonymously under the title &quot;The Adventures of Rivella&quot; (1714).

Gildon aspired to a courtly lifestyle; in 1703, Daniel Defoe attacked him as a rake who &quot;keeps six Whores, and starves his modest Wife&quot;. Gildon apparently did not forget Defoe&#x27;s insult. In 1719, Defoe published his tale of Robinson Crusoe&#x27;s adventures. Defoe&#x27;s title page reads &quot;The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner: who lived eight and twenty Years all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With an Account how he was at last as strangely deliver&#x27;d by Pyrates.&quot; Before the year was out, Gildon responded with a mocking satire, whose title page in return is &quot;The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Mr. D---- De F--, of London, Hosier, who has liv&#x27;d above fifty Years by himself in the Kingdoms of North and South Britain. The various Shapes he has appear&#x27;d in, and the Discoveries he has made for the Benefit of his Country. In a Dialogue between Him, Robinson Crusoe, and His Man Friday. With Remarks Serious and Comical upon the Life of Crusoe.&quot; Gildon used a dialogue between Defoe and his characters Robinson Crusoe and Friday to expose narrative inconsistencies in Defoe&#x27;s novel. On page xvii, Crusoe and Friday make Defoe swallow his own big books as a punishment for his unfair depiction of his characters, saying &quot;if you will make such large Compositions, you must take them for your Pains.&quot; Without explicitly identifying Gildon, Defoe defended himself against his critics in his preface to &quot;Serious Reflections of Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1720), the final installment of &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

By 1719, Gildon was blind and impoverished. Pope suggested, in his correspondence, that the blindness was due to syphilis. Gildon was in danger of starvation. In 1721, the Duchess of Buckingham gave him some relief. The same year, Robert Harley (patron and friend to Swift and Pope, earlier) gave him a 100-pound annuity as a &quot;Royal Bounty.&quot; On 12 December 1723, a benefit of Thomas Southerne&#x27;s &quot;Oroonoko&quot; was probably intended for him. Gildon died in London on 1 January 1724.

<doc id="1078440" wikidata="Q1952146" url="?curid=1078440" title="Mulesing">
<text>Mulesing (also known as &#x27;live lamb cutting&#x27;) is the removal of strips of wool-bearing skin from around the breech (buttocks) of a sheep to prevent the parasitic infection flystrike (myiasis). The wool around the buttocks can retain feces and urine, which attracts flies. The scar tissue that grows over the wound does not grow wool, so is less likely to attract the flies that cause flystrike. Mulesing is a common practice in Australia for this purpose, particularly on highly wrinkled Merino sheep. Mulesing is considered by some to be a skilled surgical task. Mulesing can only affect flystrike on the area cut out and has no effect on flystrike on any other part of the animal&#x27;s body.

Mulesing is a controversial practice. The National Farmers Federation of Australia says that &quot;mulesing remains the most effective practical way to eliminate the risk of &#x27;flystrike&#x27; in sheep&quot; and that &quot;without mulesing up to 3,000,000 sheep a year could die a slow and agonising death from flystrike&quot;. The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) &quot;recognises the welfare implications of mulesing of sheep. However, in the absence of more humane alternatives for preventing breech strike, the AVA accepts that the practice of mulesing should continue as a sheep husbandry procedure&quot;. The AVA also supports the use of analgesics and the accreditation of mulesing practitioners. The Australian Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals accepts mulesing when the risk of flystrike is very high, when it is done properly, and even then only as a last resort. The animal rights organisation PETA strongly opposes mulesing, says the practice is cruel and painful, and that more humane alternatives exist, and claim that sheep can be spared maggot infestation through more humane methods, including special diets, spray washing, and breeding different kinds of sheep. Sheep after mulesing are noted to have markedly elevated levels of the hormones cortisol and β-endorphin, respectively associated with stress and pain.

In July 2009, representatives of the Australian wool industry scrapped an earlier promise, made in November 2004, to phase out the practice of mulesing in Australia by 31 December 2010. The New Zealand industry began phasing out mulesing in 2007, and a ban of mulesing sheep officially came into effect from 1 October 2018.

==Background==
The Australian sheep blow fly (in fact an invasive species from South Africa) afflicts many sheep in Australia. In the late 19th century Merino sheep in Australia were crossbred with loose-skinned Merino sheep from Vermont. This resulted in such a productive fleece that it formed wrinkles on the animal. The popularity of Merino wool in the 20th century led Australian sheep breeders to continue selecting for the thickest possible fleeces on their sheep. This lucrative trait often meant that the thick, wrinkled wool on the sheep&#x27;s rear readily attracted and held dirt and feces. This collection of unsanitary material as well as the skin ulcers it sometimes caused are very attractive to gravid female blowflies. Female blow flies seek out sheep with wounds and soiled wool to lay their eggs. Once the maggots hatch they gravitate to open wounds if any are present. This is &quot;flystrike&quot;, a type of myiasis. Flystrike, also called &quot;breechstrike&quot;, often leads to systemic secondary infections and death.  

In the early 1930s an Australian rancher named John Mules was shearing a ewe when he accidentally cut off a small patch of skin near the ewe&#x27;s breech (buttocks). The ewe had suffered from flystrike before and Mules carefully watched her progress in case she developed another infestation in the wound he had accidentally caused. To Mules&#x27; surprise, once the wound healed it replaced tangled and dirty breech wool with smooth scar tissue. Blowflies were no longer attracted to this area on the ewe as it could not collect dirt or feces. No relapse of flystrike occurred. Mules and others soon developed this into a technique now known as mulesing.

During this operation small strips of skin are peeled from a sheep&#x27;s buttock using steel shears on either side of the anus and underside of the tail. This was formerly performed on mature sheep but it was later found that lambs recover more quickly and completely than older animals. For lambs older than two months the period of greatest discomfort seems to last for approximately two weeks, by which time healing is almost complete. , CSIRO&#x27;s (an Australian-based international organisation) codes of practice ban mulesing for sheep over 12 months of age.

Mulesing reduces the likelihood of flystrike by about 13 times. The practice became nearly universal during the 20th century. The success of animal rights movements in agitating for the procedure&#x27;s curtailment has brought the proportion of Australian sheep ranchers who practice mulesing down to around 70%. Successful international boycotts of Australian Merino wool in the early 2000s set those invested in Australian sheep rearing on the hunt for alternatives. The publicity generated intense interest in finding a replacement for mulesing that domestic and international consumers will accept.

==Method==
Mulesing is a procedure which, in Australia, is carried out by a person who has completed the mandatory accreditation and training programme, usually a professional mulesing contractor.

While the lamb is under restraint (typically in a marking cradle), the wrinkled skin in the animal&#x27;s breech (rump area) is cut away from the perianal region down to the top of the hindlimbs. Originally, the procedure was typically performed with modified wool-trimming metal shears, but now there are similar metal shears designed specifically for mulesing. In addition, the tail is docked and the remaining stump is sometimes skinned. The cuts are executed to avoid affecting underlying muscle tissue.

The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries states in the Standard Operating Procedures that, &quot;While the operation causes some pain, no pre or post operative pain relief measures are used&quot;. Antiseptics, anaesthesia and painkillers are not required by Australian law during or after the procedure but are often applied, as the procedure is known to be painful to the animal. Products have been approved for pain relief during the procedure, including Tri-Solfen. The minor use permit for Tri-Solfen makes the product available for use by both veterinarians and sheep industry employees, such as mulesing contractors and graziers.

After a heavy mules, non-wooled skin around the anus (and vulva in ewes) is pulled tight, the cut heals and results in smooth scar tissue that does not get fouled by faeces or urine. Most sheep have a light mules which does not leave the skin bare, but simply removes the skin wrinkle leaving a reduced area to grow wool and stain.

When managed according to the standards, policies and procedures developed by the CSIRO, lambs are normally mulesed a few weeks after birth. The operation usually takes less than a minute. Standard practice is to do this operation simultaneously with other procedures such as ear marking, tail docking, and vaccination. Because the procedure removes skin, not any underlying flesh or structure, there is little blood loss from the cut other than a minor oozing on the edges of the cut skin.

Mulesed lambs should be released onto clean pasture. The ewes and suckling lambs should receive minimal disturbance until all wounds are completely healed (about four weeks). Observation should be carried out from a distance.

Mulesing should be completed well before the flystrike season, or else chemical protection should be provided to reduce risk to the lambs and ewes.

Lambs that are slaughtered soon after weaning generally do not need mulesing because they can be protected by chemical treatment for the short time they are at risk.

==Comparison to crutching==
Mulesing is different from crutching. Crutching is the mechanical removal of wool around the tail and anus (and vulva in ewes) in breeds of sheep with woolly points where this is necessary. Mulesing is the removal of skin to provide permanent resistance to breech strike in Merino sheep. Other breeds tend to have less loose skin and wool so close to the tail, and may have less dense wool.

Crutching has to be repeated at regular intervals as the wool grows continuously. Frequent crutching of Merinos reduces the incidence of flystrike, but not as much as mulesing.

==Opposition to mulesing==
Some animal rights activists consider unanesthetised mulesing to be inhumane and unnecessary. They have also argued that mulesing may mask genetic susceptibility to flystrike allowing for genetic weaknesses to be continued.

Proponents of mulesing are largely from Australia where severe and often fatal flystrike is common.

In October 2004, American fashion retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. responded to pressure from PETA to boycott Australian Merino wool due in part to the use of mulesing in Australia. The National Farmers&#x27; Federation responded by stating &quot;Abercrombie and Fitch does not use Australian wool&quot;. Then, in December 2008, one of the world&#x27;s largest retailers, Liz Claiborne (in which PETA is a shareholder), banned the use of Australian Merino wool in its products in opposition to the mulesing practice; at the time an Australian Wool Innovations spokesman said &quot;the company did not purchase any Australian wool&quot;. In June 2009, British department store chain John Lewis joined the wool boycott. The international fashion retailer New Look also refuses to stock products made from Australian Merino wool. The campaign by PETA also seeks to draw attention to Australia&#x27;s live sheep-export trade. PETA&#x27;s campaign has hurt the Australian wool industry with several American and European clothing retailers agreeing to the boycott.

Australian interior furnishing wholesaler Instyle Contract Textiles endorses the cessation of mulesing. In early 2008, the company signed an exclusive worldwide agreement with The SRS Company to source wool from non-mulesed Merino sheep that have been bred specifically to be naturally resistant to flystrike.

The controversy reignited after a television programme aired in Sweden. This programme alleged that a lobbying consultant, Kevin Craig, acting on behalf of the Australian Wool and Sheep Industry Taskforce offered a Swedish activist a free trip to Australia if the activist agreed not to go on camera nor do an interview. As a consequence, all clothing manufacturers and retailers in Sweden banned the purchase of wool from sheep that have been mulesed. Since then, the Swedish Agriculture Minister, Eskil Erlandsson, has said that &quot;he was satisfied that Australia appeared to be responding to international concerns about mulesing and that bans or boycotts were not necessary&quot;. &quot;But in the long run we hope there is going to be a final end to all sorts of mulesing.&quot;

Some European retailers have agreed to lift their ban on Australian Merino wool if pain relief is used during mulesing. The retailers have not been named in an effort to avoid any backlash.

In order to help comply with the 2010 deadline to phase out mulesing, Western Australia&#x27;s governmental research stations ceased mulesing their sheep on 1 April 2008.

Australian Wool Innovation (AWI) had pledged to phase out mulesing by 2010, but PETA accused the Australian wool industry of trying to extend this deadline. On 27 July 2009, the Australian wool industry dumped its long-standing pledge to phase out mulesing by the end of 2010, a move that was harshly criticized by animal welfare groups and led to criticism by some farmers. The AWI maintains that pursuing a deadline approach to eliminating mulesing was not based on &quot;sound health and welfare science&quot; and risked a serious deterioration in the welfare of sheep. Alternative methods of mulesing, such as using clips and intradermals, were &quot;not sufficiently developed to support a wholesale cessation of the procedure in 2010&quot;, AWI said.

The AWI&#x27;s approach is &quot;The ultimate long-term aim of the program is to reduce the reliance on mulesing.&quot; and &quot;supports all woolgrowers in their choice of best practice animal health and hygiene in flystrike control&quot;, but aims to provide animal welfare improvements such as pain relief and antiseptics.

In December 2020, Four Paws compiled a list of fashion brands who have taken a stance against mulesing.

==Alternatives==

=== Freeze branding ===
In response to intense consumer pressure for an alternative to mulesing an adaptation of the freeze branding branding process was hit upon in the 2010s. The new technique was soon christened &quot;steining&quot; after its developer, John Steinfort, an Australian veterinary scientist. In 2019 Australian Wool Network (AWN), a private corporation servicing the Australian wool industry, provided Steinfort funding to commercialize the technique.

During &quot;steining&quot; a set of clamping jaws designed by Steinfort is used to pinch up rolls of skin near the tail and anus of a lamb. Once sufficient skin is in the clamps liquid nitrogen is pumped through the jaws and onto the pinched skin. This rapidly freezes the lamb&#x27;s skin. The goal is to achieve the level of cellular injury that prevents future hair growth but not so much that a 3rd degree cold burn is created. Pinching the skin is thought to mitigate the degree of the cold burn by removing it somewhat from the muscles and connective tissue beneath. The treated skin goes through the same stages of healing seen in the long method of freeze branding, terminating with permanent hairlessness. Studies show this method is at least as good at preventing flystrike as mulesing and carries few long-term consequences for the lamb&#x27;s later growth and wool production.

Steinfort and others invested in the process have claimed it is less painful and distressing to the animals on which it is practiced. They argue that affected nerve endings are immediately numbed and that sensation does not return during healing, when a scab forms and is eventually sloughed in 6 to 8 weeks. A 2018 study found behavioral markers indicating pain and distress in lambs who had been steined without analgesic treatment compared to those who had been given analgesics. In 2020 a University of Melbourne researcher named Ellen Jongman was commissioned to study the issue by the company Steinfort formed to commercialize his technique, SteinfortAgVet. The name of Steinfort&#x27;s company subsequently changed to AgVetInnovations. On December 22, 2020 Jongman released preliminary results from her study on the relative pain of mulesing and steining.

Jongman found that mulesing and steining were equally painful on the day of the procedure but that steined lambs appeared to be in less pain than mulesed lambs on subsequent days. Her study tracked and interpreted a series of lamb behaviors like the speed at which it returned to its mother after undergoing either mulesing or steining. She called for further research using physiological data such heart rate and blood sampling in addition to behavioral observations. Jongman&#x27;s final report was released on January 25, 2021. In March of 2021 AWN cut ties with Steinfort and divested from this application of freeze branding.

As of July 22, 2021 the position of the RSPCA is that Australian Merino sheep have not been ethically bred, as seen in their susceptibility to flystrike. They believe &quot;any painful procedure to change the breech area should only be considered an interim, short-term solution that accompanies a breeding program that focusses on flystrike resistance, and is carried out only where absolutely necessary to manage at-risk sheep.&quot;

===Breeding programs===
Merino sheep bred on selection principles may be more resistant to flystrike because they are plain bodied (lower skin wrinkling around the breech). Studies have shown that flystrike is lower in plain bodied sheep. However, mulesed animals had consistently lower flystrike than unmulesed regardless of body type.

The resistance of plain-bodied Merino sheep to flystrike arose from field investigations by Australian scientists, Drs H. R. Seddon and H. B. Belschner, in the early 1930s. Non-mulesed Merino ewe bodies were graded as plain (A class), wrinkly (B class) and very wrinkly (C class). The plain-bodied (A class) Merino ewes were much less susceptible to flystrike than wrinkly-bodied Merinos (B and C class).

In these Merino flocks, the sheep are plainer than the plain-bodied (A class) Merino ewes and therefore more resistant to flystrike. The rams and semen from these studs are used in over 3,000 of the 45,000 Merino farms in Australia. Using breeding principles, wrinkle-skinned Merino flocks which require mulesing have been transformed into plain-bodied and mules-free flocks within five years.

===Non-surgical alternatives===
Several non-surgical alternatives are currently being researched:

* Insecticides: Any number of insecticides are now available for prevention of fly strike, and even early reviews proclaimed the effectiveness of using dip across the whole animal, rather than cutting one small portion that left the rest of the animal still susceptible &quot;dipping is still the most cost effective means of protecting sheep from flystrike&quot;.
* Topical protein-based treatments which kill wool follicles and tighten skin in the breech area (&quot;intradermal injections&quot;)
* Biological control of blowflies.
* Plastic clips on the sheep&#x27;s skin folds which act like castration bands, removing the skin (&quot;breech clips&quot;).
* Tea tree oil as a 1% formulation dip where tests have shown a 100% kill rate of first-stage maggots and a strong repellent effect against adult flies, which prevented eggs being laid on the wool for up to six weeks.

<text>Robert Gilfillan (7 July 1798 – 4 December 1850) was a Scottish poet and songwriter.

==Life==

He was born in Dunfermline in Fife, Scotland, the son of Robert Gilfillan (died 1834), a master weaver, and his wife, Marion Law. In 1811 the family moved to Leith. Around 1812/13 he was apprenticed as a cooper to John Thomson of Peatnook in Leith. In 1818 he returned to Dunfermline to work as a grocer. He returned to Leith in 1821 and worked in various warehouses and wine stores.

His connection with Dunfermline was by no means severed as it was in the town’s Masonic Lodge, Lodge St. John, No. 26 that he was initiated into Freemasonry in December 1821 and, like Robert Burns, he did so before he became famous.

He contributed to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Noctes Ambrosianae&quot; he also represented the Scotman newspaper in Leith.

From 1837 he was a collector of the police rates at Leith, based at Leith Town Hall (now Leith Police Station).

In April 1850 he organised the restoration of the memorial to Robert Fergusson in Canongate Kirkyard on the Royal Mile.

He died of apoplexy at his home in East Hermitage on Leith Links where he lived with his niece, Marion Gilfillan. He is buried in South Leith Parish Churchyard, just south-east of the church.

<text>In linguistics, syllable weight is the concept that syllables pattern together according to the number and/or duration of segments in the rime. In classical Indo-European verse, as developed in Greek, Sanskrit, and Latin, distinctions of syllable weight were fundamental to the meter of the line.

==Linguistics==

A heavy syllable is a syllable with a branching nucleus or a branching rime, although not all such syllables are heavy in every language. A branching nucleus generally means the syllable has a long vowel or a diphthong; this type of syllable is abbreviated as CVV. A syllable with a branching rime is a &quot;closed syllable&quot;, that is, one with a coda (one or more consonants at the end of the syllable); this type of syllable is abbreviated CVC. In some languages, both CVV and CVC syllables are heavy, while a syllable with a short vowel as the nucleus and no coda (a CV syllable) is a light syllable. In other languages, only CVV syllables are heavy, while CVC and CV syllables are light. In yet other languages, CVV syllables are heavy and CV syllables are light, while some CVC syllables are heavy (for instance if the coda is a sonorant) and other CVC syllables are light (for instance if the coda is an obstruent). Some languages distinguish a third type, CVVC syllables (with both a branching nucleus and a coda) and/or CVCC syllables (with a coda consisting of two or more consonants) as superheavy syllables.

In moraic theory, heavy syllables are analyzed as containing two morae, light syllables one, and superheavy syllables three.

The distinction between heavy and light syllables plays an important role in the phonology of some languages, especially with regard to the assignment of stress. For instance, in the Sezer stress pattern in Turkish observed in place names, the main stress occurs as an iamb (i.e. penultimate stress) one syllable to the left of the final syllable: (L&#x27;L)σ. However, when the foot contains a heavy syllable in the first syllable while the second syllable is light, the iamb shifts to a trochee (i.e. antepenultimate stress) because there is a requirement that main stress fall on a heavy syllable whenever possible: (&#x27;HL)σ, and not *(H&#x27;L)σ.

==Classical poetry==

===Basic definition===
In Ancient Greek hexameter poetry and Latin literature, lines followed certain metrical patterns, such as based on arrangements of heavy and light syllables. A heavy syllable was referred to as a &#x27; and a light as a &#x27; (and in the modern day, reflecting the ancient terms, a is often called a &quot;long syllable&quot; and a a &quot;short syllable&quot;, potentially creating confusion between syllable length and vowel length).

Similarly, in Classical Sanskrit meter, metrical patterns consisted of arrangements of syllable weight groups, called gaṇas (parallel to Greek metrical feet). A heavy syllable was named guru, and a light syllable was laghu.

A syllable was considered heavy if it contained a long vowel or a diphthong (and was therefore &quot;long by nature&quot;—it would be long no matter what) or if it contained a short vowel that was followed by more than one consonant (&quot;long by position&quot;, long by virtue of its relationship to the consonants following). On the other hand, a syllable was light if it was an open syllable and contained only a short vowel.
An example in Latin:
:
: (&quot;Aeneid&quot; 1.1-2)

The first syllable of the first word (&#x27;) is heavy (&quot;long by position&quot;) because it contains a short vowel (the A) followed by more than one consonant (R and then M)—and if not for the consonants coming after it, it would be light. The second syllable is light because it contains a short vowel (an A) followed immediately by only one consonant (the V). The next syllable is light for the same reason. The next syllable, the second syllable of the word &#x27;, is heavy (&quot;long by position&quot;) because it contains a short vowel followed by more than one consonant (the M and then the Q).

But, for example, the first syllable of the word &#x27; is heavy (&quot;long by nature&quot;) because it contains a diphthong, regardless of the sounds coming after it. Likewise, the fifth syllable of the second line (the first of the word &#x27;) is heavy (&quot;long by nature&quot;) because it contains a long vowel, and it will be heavy no matter what sounds come after. (The word &quot;Italiam&quot; is a special case, in that poets &quot;treat&quot; it as having a long-by-nature first syllable which it actually has not, in order to make it fit somehow.)

Terming a syllable &quot;long by position&quot; is equivalent to noting that the syllable ends with a consonant (a closed syllable), because Latin and Greek speakers in the classical era pronounced a consonant as part of a preceding syllable only when it was followed by other consonants, due to the rules of Greek and Latin syllabification. In a consonant cluster, one consonant ends the preceding syllable and the rest start the following syllable. For example, Latin syllabifies &#x27; as &#x27; but &#x27; as &#x27; and &#x27; as &#x27;.

===Exceptions and additions===
A few exceptions to and elaborations of the above rules of heavy and light syllables:
* The Greek letters (zeta, xi, and psi) and their Roman equivalents and (and ) were pronounced as two consonants, so they lengthen by position despite being represented by a single character. For example, the first syllable of &quot;&quot; is heavy, despite the short vowel followed only by one written consonant, because the Z was pronounced as two consonants and lengthens the syllable by position.
*Sanskrit meter also treats the letters अं and अः (the anusvara and visarga) as full consonants for purposes of syllable weight, despite being classified typically as vowels.
* The combination stop–liquid (usually) or stop–nasal (sometimes) cohered in both Latin and Greek; that is, the two consonants were pronounced together with the speed of one consonant. As a result, they did not lengthen by position if the poet did not want them to (although they could if the poet chose). For example, the first syllable of &#x27; is generally light, even though it has a short vowel followed by two consonants, because the consonants cohere (and the word is syllabified &#x27;). However, the combination aspirate-nasal or voiced consonant-nasal did not cohere and always lengthened by position.
* In Homer and his imitators, the digamma (), a sound defunct in the standard Ionic alphabet and lost from pronunciation by the classical period, was still felt enough to lengthen by position, even though it is normally not written in the Homeric poems. For example, in the line (&quot;Odyssey&quot;, 9.3), the first syllable of is long, even though it has a short vowel followed by only one consonant, because the word was originally , and the digamma was still felt enough to lengthen the syllable by position. Since the digamma was being lost during the time when the Homeric poems were composed, recited, and written down, its effects are sometimes not felt, so that words that would have contained a digamma sometimes do not show its effects.

As noted above, the number and order of heavy and light syllables in a line of poetry (together with word breaks) articulated the meter of the line, such as the most famous classical meter, the epic dactylic hexameter.

<text>George Gillespie ( ; 21 January 1613 – 17 December 1648) was a Scottish theologian.

==Family== 
He married Margaret Murray, who had £1000 sterling voted by Parliament immediately after his death, for the support of herself and family, but, owing to the distractions of the time, it was never paid. His children were:
*Robert Gillespie, baptised 15 May 1643 (who received ordination from the &quot;outed&quot; ministers. Robert was imprisoned in the Bass for preaching at conventicles (1673). Robert subsequently went to England, and died, his widow and children being recommended by Parliament to the royal bounty, 17 July 1695
*George, baptised 20 May 1644
*Archibald, died in 1659
*Elizabeth (married James Oswald, merchant in Edinburgh, afterwards of Fingleton).

==Life==
Gillespie was born at Kirkcaldy, where his father, John Gillespie, was parish minister. His sister was the Quaker writer, prophet and preacher Lilias Skene. He studied at St. Andrews University as a &quot;presbytery bursar&quot;. On graduating he became domestic chaplain to John Gordon, 1st Viscount Kenmure (d. 1634), and afterwards to John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis. His conscience did not permit him to accept the episcopal ordination, which was at that time an indispensable condition of induction to a parish in Scotland.

In April 1638, soon after the authority of the bishops had been abolished by the nation in Scotland, Gillespie was ordained minister of Wemyss (Fife) by the presbytery of Kirkcaldy. In the same year he was a member of the Glasgow Assembly, before which he preached a sermon, on 21 November, against royal interference in matters ecclesiastical. It was so pronounced as to call for some remonstrance on the part of Argyll, the Lord High Commissioner.

In 1640 he accompanied the commissioners of the peace to England as one of their chaplains. In 1642 Gillespie was translated to Edinburgh; but the remainder of his life was chiefly spent in the conduct of public business in London. From 1643 onward, he was a member of the Westminster Assembly, in which he took a prominent part: he was appointed by the Scottish Church as one of the four commissioners to the Assembly. He was the youngest member at the Assembly, but took a great part in almost all the discussions on church government, discipline, and worship. He strongly supported Presbyterianism by numerous writings, as well as by fluency and readiness in debate. One of the most notable is his well preserved encounter with John Selden on Erastianism and Presbyterian polity.

In 1645 he returned to Scotland, and is said to have drawn the Act of Assembly sanctioning the directory of public worship. On his return to London he had a hand in drafting the Westminster confession of faith, especially chapter I.

Gillespie was elected moderator of the Assembly in 1648, but the duties of that office (the court continued to sit from 12 July to 12 August) told on his health; he fell into consumption, and died in Kirkcaldy on 17 December 1648. In acknowledgment of his public services, a sum of 1000 Scots was voted, although destined never to be paid, to his widow and children by the committee of estates. A simple tombstone, which had been erected to his memory in Kirkcaldy parish church, was, in 1661, publicly broken at the cross by the hand of the common hangman, but was restored in 1746. His son, Robert, was later imprisoned at Bass Rock.

==Works==

A man of notable intellectual power, he exercised an influence remarkable especially as he died in his 36th year. He was one of the most formidable controversialists of a highly controversial age. His best known work is &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Rod Blossoming&quot;, a defense of the ecclesiastical claims of the high Presbyterian party.

While with the Earl of Cassillis he wrote his first work, &quot;A Dispute against the English Popish Ceremonies obtruded upon the Church of Scotland&quot;, which, published shortly after the &quot;Jenny Geddes&quot; incident (but without the author&#x27;s name) in the summer of 1637, attracted considerable attention. Within a few months it had been found by the Privy Council to be so damaging that by their orders all available copies were called in and burnt.

His principal publications were controversial and chiefly against Erastianism:

*Three sermons against Thomas Coleman;
*A Sermon before the House of Lords (27 August 1645), on Matt. iii. 2, Nihil Respondem and Male Audis;

*Aaron&#x27;s Rod Blossoming, or the Divine Ordinance of Church-government vindicated (1646), which is regarded as an able statement of the case for an exclusive spiritual jurisdiction in the church;

*One Hundred and Eleven Propositions concerning the Ministry and Government of the Church (Edinburgh, 1647).

The following were posthumously published by his brother: 
*A Treatise of Miscellany Questions (1649);

*The Ark of the New Testament (2 vols., 1661–1667);
*Notes of Debates and Proceedings of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, from February 1644 to January 1645.

<text>John Gillies (; 1747–1836) was a Scottish tutor, historian and man of letters.

==Life==
Gillies was born at Brechin, in Forfarshire, the son of Robert Gillies of Little Keithock, a merchant, and his wife, Margaret Smith. He was educated in Brechin and then sent to the University of Glasgow, where, at the age of twenty, he acted for a short time as substitute for the professor of Greek. He graduated MA in 1764. He lived for a while in Germany and returned in 1784. He was awarded a doctorate (LLD) in the same year.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1789.

In 1793 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Gregory, William Wright, and John Playfair.

On the death of William Robertson (1721–1793), Gillies was appointed Historiographer Royal for Scotland. In his old age he retired to Clapham, where he died on 15 February 1836. He was the older brother of judge Adam Gillies, Lord Gillies.

==Works==
His &quot;History of Ancient Greece, its Colonies and Conquests&quot; was published in 1786; it was translated into French and German. This work was written with a strong monarchist bias. See for instance the opening &#x27;dedication to the king&#x27;: &#x27;The history of Greece exposes the dangerous turbulence of democracy, and arraigns the despotism of tyrants. By describing the incurable evils inherent in every form of Republican policy, it evinces the inestimable benefits resulting to liberty itself from the lawful dominion of hereditary kings, and the steady operation of well-regulated monarchy&#x27;.
Other works included:

*&quot;View of the Reign of Frederic II of Prussia, with a Parallel between that Prince and Philip II of Macedon&quot; (1789), rather a panegyric than a critical history; 
*translations of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot; (1823) and &quot;Ethics&quot; and &quot;Politics&quot; (1786–1797); 
*translations of the &quot;Orations&quot; of Lysias and Isocrates (1778)
*&quot;History of the World from Alexander to Augustus&quot; (1807).

<text>The Kennel Murder Case is a 1933 murder mystery novel written by S. S. Van Dine with fictional detective Philo Vance investigating a complex locked-room mystery.
==Plot summary==

One of the Coe brothers is found dead in his bedroom, locked from the inside, and the other brother is found the next morning dead in the downstairs closet. There is also the clue of a wounded Scottish Terrier, a shy Doberman Pinscher, a mysteriously broken piece of priceless Chinese porcelain, and a cast of suspicious family members, servants and associates. Philo Vance solves the case based on his knowledge of dog breeding, Chinese porcelain and the annals of remarkable antique crimes.

==Film adaptations==
:&quot;See The Kennel Murder Case (film)&quot;
A Warner Bros. film version of &quot;The Kennel Murder Case&quot; appeared in 1933. The film was directed by Michael Curtiz and starred William Powell as Philo Vance, reprising the role after appearing as Vance in three earlier films for Paramount, and Mary Astor as Hilda Lake, the victims&#x27; niece. Many film historians (including William K. Everson, who pronounced it a &quot;masterpiece&quot; in the August 1984 issue of &quot;Films in Review&quot;) consider it one of the greatest screen adaptations of a Golden Age mystery novel, and rank it with the 1946 film &quot;Green for Danger&quot;.

&quot;The Kennel Murder Case&quot; was remade by Warners in 1940 as &quot;Calling Philo Vance&quot; with James Stephenson as Vance and William Clemens directing. World War II-era espionage stood in for the skulduggery of the art world in the remake.

==Literary significance and criticism==
According to the 1936 introduction to the novel, in the omnibus &quot;Philo Vance Murder Cases&quot;, the two halves were written nearly a year apart. Several real-life friends of author S. S. Van Dine appear as themselves in the second half of the novel.

&quot;Though dogs can be dangerous in life and in detection, this imbroglio by the precious and pedantic Van Dine is rather better than the rest of those written after 1930. It is a locked-room murder, there are clues, and Vance is not obnoxious beyond endurance.&quot;

<doc id="1078459" wikidata="Q1146145" url="?curid=1078459" title="Entasis">
<text>In architecture, entasis is the application of a convex curve to a surface for aesthetic purposes, or increasing strength. Its best-known use is in certain orders of Classical columns that diminish in a very gentle curve, rather than in a straight line as they narrow going upward. The human eye would believe that the middle of the column was diminishing in a concave curve halfway up the column, and entasis corrects this.

==Etymology==
The word we apply to the design principle is used by the Roman architectural historian Vitruvius, and derives from the Greek word έντείνω (&quot;enteino&quot;), &quot;to stretch or strain tight&quot;. Creating the illusion of greater strength or perception of height may have been an objective in the application of entasis.

==Examples==
Examples of this design principle may be found in cultures throughout the world, from ancient times to contemporary architecture. The first use of entasis is probably in the Later Temple of Aphaia at Aigina, in the 490s BC.

It may be observed among Classical period Greek column designs, for example, in the Doric order temples in Segesta, Selinus, Agrigento, and Paestum.

It was used less frequently in Hellenistic and Roman period architecture. The Roman temples built during these periods were sometimes higher than those of the Greeks, with longer and thinner columns.

Chinese carpenters of the Song Dynasty followed designs in the AD 1103 Yingzao Fashi (Treatise on Architectural Methods or State Building Standards) that specified straight columns or those with an entasis on the upper third of the shaft.

Noted architects, such as the Renaissance master Andrea Palladio, also used entasis in the designs of their buildings.

Entasis was often a feature of Inca walls and doorways to counteract the optical illusion that would make the openings appear narrower in their middles.

==Concave curves==
The opposite effect, applying curves in order to narrow surfaces that otherwise would appear to bulge, is also found in architecture, as in 
the sloping or battered walls of some Tibetan and Bhutanese monasteries and fortresses. The lower parts of such walls, approximately one third, have a slight concave or inward curve, while the higher parts retain an even slope, offsetting the outwardly bulging illusion created by a straight sloping wall. An example in Bhutan is the Dobji Dzong. When some collapsed walls of the Punakha Dzong were rebuilt, around 1996, this asymmetry was not used.

===In calligraphy===
In calligraphy and typography entasis refers to the use of a concave curve to thin — rather than widen — the waist of a stroke or character. In calligraphy this is achieved either through a slight heightening of the pen or brush angle and/or by an increase in the speed of the stroke as it goes into a straight. Visually it is reminiscent of the structure of a bone and a stroke is seen as stronger for it. Entasis in a stroke is intended to counter the illusion a stroke with perfectly straight sides has of bulging slightly.

==Origin in Greek columns==
No record of the rationale for using entasis in columns by Classical builders has yet been discovered.. As a result, there has been extensive conjecture over its purpose.

An early view, often articulated and still widespread, espoused by Hero of Alexandria, is that entasis corrects the optical illusion of concavity in the columns that the fallible human eye would create if the correction were not made. However, modern psychological research suggests that people do not actually experience any illusion that could be compensated by this design. 

Some descriptions of entasis state simply that the technique was an enhancement applied to the more primitive conical columns to make them appear more substantial. Other descriptions argue that the technique emphasizes the substantiality of, not the columns, but rather, of some other part or of the building while being viewed as a whole. Yale architectural historian Vincent Scully argues that entasis emphasizes the weight of the roof of a building by making the building columns appear to bulge under the pressure distributed among them. Danish architect Steen Eiler Rasmussen believed that the effect represented strength by imitating the swelling of a strained muscle, a theory that accords well with the etymology of the word, from the Greek meaning &quot;to strain&quot;.

It also has been argued that a &quot;stunted cycloid&quot; column that bulges in the middle is stronger structurally than is a column whose diameter changes according to a linear progression, therefore, having a sound engineering purpose. Because their discussion of the application of the principle has never been discovered, it is unknown, however, whether the early Greeks knew this.

<doc id="1078460" wikidata="Q5721984" url="?curid=1078460" title="Henry Glapthorne">
<text>Henry Glapthorne (baptised, 28 July 1610 – c. 1643) was an English dramatist and poet, baptized in Cambridgeshire, the son of Thomas Glapthorne and Faith &quot;née&quot; Hatcliff. His father was a bailiff of Lady Hatton, the wife of Sir Edward Coke. Before turning 14, Henry Glapthorne had matriculated as a pensioner at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, but there is no record of him ever taking a degree. From then until he emerges as a playwright in the mid-1630s, little is known of him. There is evidence that he may have been employed as a groom-porter in a nobleman&#x27;s household for some of that time – a later document refers to him as &quot;Glapthorne the Porter&quot; – but there is nothing conclusive.

==Writings==
His best-regarded work is &quot;Argalus and Parthenia&quot; (c. 1633, printed 1639), based on Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot;. Other plays are the comedy &quot;The Hollander&quot; (licensed for performance 12 March 1636), &quot;Wit in a Constable&quot; (c. 1638), and the tragicomedy &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Privilege&quot; (all printed 1640), and the historical tragedy &quot;Albertus Wallenstein&quot; (c. 1634–1639, printed 1639), based on a famous general in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Glapthorne published a volume of &quot;Poems&quot; in 1639, with a series addressed to &quot;Lucinda&quot;, and a 1643 poem entitled &quot;Whitehall&quot; dedicated to Richard Lovelace, among other minor works. A collected edition, &quot;The Plays and Poems of Henry Glapthorne,&quot; appeared in 1874. In 1883, the editor A. H. Bullen attributed to Glapthorne the anonymous play &quot;The Lady Mother&quot;, written c. 1633–1635, which has been accepted by the consensus of critical opinion.

The play &quot;Revenge for Honour&quot;, first printed in 1654 and misattributed to George Chapman, may be another work of Glapthorne&#x27;s; it was entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 29 November 1653, as his, under the title &quot;The Parricide, or Revenge for Honour&quot;. A play called &quot;The Parricide&quot;, was acted in 1624, but Glapthorne would have been only 14 years old at the time.

==Later years==
On 1 July 1642, his daughter Lovelace (probably named in honour of his friend Richard Lovelace) was baptized in the City of London parish of St Bride&#x27;s, Fleet Street; the record also mentions the name of Glapthorne&#x27;s wife as Susan. On 23 March 1643, Susan was buried in the nearby parish of St Andrew&#x27;s, Holborn, having died the day before in Fetter Lane. The location of her death confirms that Henry Glapthorne is the &quot;one Glapthorne, who lived in Fetter Lane&quot;, who on 12 January 1643 was identified to the House of Lords as the author of the tract &quot;His Maiesties Gracious Answer to The Message sent from the Honourable Citie of London, concerning Peace&quot; (1643). He, his printer Richard Herne and others, were supposed to be brought in to give evidence on the subject a few weeks later, but no further record has been found of what happened to him. Gerald Eades Bentley believes it likely that he died before the Restoration.

<text>William Nugent Glascock (– 9 October 1847) was an Irish officer in the Royal Navy and a novelist. He saw service during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and later in the years of relative peace.

==Early life==
Glascock was born about 1787 in Baltinglass, County Wicklow, and joined the navy in January 1800, serving aboard the frigate under Captain George Duff. In January 1801 Duff transferred to the 74-gun third rate ship of the line and took Glascock with him. Glascock spent the next few years with Duff seeing service in the Baltic, off the coast of Ireland and in the West Indies. In 1803 he was appointed to the newly built 74-gun and afterwards to the 90-gun , in which he took part in the Battle of Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, and later in the blockade of Brest under Admiral William Cornwallis. In November 1808 he was promoted to lieutenant of , and served in her at the reduction of Flushing in August 1809. In 1812 he was a lieutenant of the 74-gun in the Bay of Biscay.

Glascock afterwards served in a number of frigates on the home station, successively , , and , and in the 32-gun HMS &quot;Sir Francis Drake&quot;, flagship of Sir Charles Hamilton on the Newfoundland Station. He was promoted from her to the command of the sloop in November 1818. In 1819 he commanded the brig , from which he was obliged to resign as an invalid. In 1830 Glascock was appointed to the sloop , which he commanded on the home station during 1831, but in 1832 he was sent to the coast of Portugal, and during the latter months of the year was stationed in the Douro, for the protection of British interests in the disturbed state of the country during the Liberal Wars.

Glascock continued in the Douro, as senior officer, for nearly a year, during which time his conduct under troublesome and often difficult circumstances won for him the approval of the Admiralty and promotion to post-rank, on 3 June 1833, accompanied by a special and complimentary letter from Sir James Graham, the first lord. He did not, however, leave the Douro until the following September, and on 1 October he paid off the &quot;Orestes&quot;. From April 1843 to January 1847 he commanded the frigate on the Mediterranean station, and during the following months was employed in Ireland as an inspector under the Poor Relief Act. He died suddenly on 8 October 1847 at Baltinglass. He was married and left children.

==Writing career==
Glascock devoted the long intervals of half-pay, both as commander and captain, to writing, and produced several volumes of naval novels, anecdotes, reminiscences, and reflections. His biographer in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, J. K. Laughton remarked that &quot;as novels, [they] are stupid enough, and in their historical parts have little value, but are occasionally interesting as social sketches of naval life in the early part of the century.&quot;

Glascock wrote a two-volume work, &quot;The Naval Sketch Book, or The Service Afloat and Ashore&quot;, published in 1826. This was followed by the three-volume &quot;Sailors and Saints, or Matrimonial Manœuvres&quot; in 1829, &quot;Tales of a Tar, with Characteristic Anecdotes&quot; in 1836, and the three-volume &quot;Land Sharks and Sea Gulls&quot; in 1838. He also wrote a two-volume work entitled &quot;Naval Service, or Officers&#x27; Manual&quot;, published in 1836. This useful manual for young officers passed through four editions in England. The last, published in 1859, had a short advertisement by Glascock&#x27;s daughter, stating that &quot;the work has been translated into French, Russian, Swedish, and Turkish, and adopted by the navies of those powers, as well as by that of the United States.&quot; Laughton remarked that the work was &quot;of course, quite obsolete, though still interesting to the student of naval history and customs.&quot;

<text>Cerebral angiography is a form of angiography which provides images of blood vessels in and around the brain, thereby allowing detection of abnormalities such as arteriovenous malformations and aneurysms.
It was pioneered in 1927 by the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz at the University of Lisbon, who also helped develop thorotrast for use in the procedure.

Typically a catheter is inserted into a large artery (such as the femoral artery) and threaded through the circulatory system to the carotid artery, where a contrast agent is injected. A series of radiographs are taken as the contrast agent spreads through the brain&#x27;s arterial system, then a second series as it reaches the venous system.

For some applications, cerebral angiography may yield better images than less invasive methods such as computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography.
In addition, cerebral angiography allows certain treatments to be performed immediately, based on its findings. In recent decades, cerebral angiography has so assumed a therapeutic connotation thanks to the elaboration of endovascular therapeutic techniques. Embolization (a minimally invasive surgical technique) over time has played an increasingly significant role in the multimodal treatment of cerebral MAVs, facilitating subsequent microsurgical or radiosurgical treatment. Another type of treatment possible by angiography (if the images reveal an aneurysm) is the introduction of metal coils through the catheter already in place and maneuvered to the site of aneurysm; over time these coils encourage formation of connective tissue at the site, strengthening the vessel walls.

In some jurisdictions, cerebral angiography is required to confirm brain death.

Prior to the advent of modern neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and CT in the mid-1970s, cerebral angiographies were frequently employed as a tool to infer the existence and location of certain kinds of lesions and hematomas by looking for secondary vascular displacement caused by the mass effect related to these medical conditions. This use of angiography as an &quot;indirect&quot; assessment tool is nowadays obsolete as modern non-invasive diagnostic methods are available to image many kinds of primary intracranial abnormalities directly. It is still widely used however for evaluating various types of vascular pathologies within the skull.

== Uses ==
Cerebral angiography is used for diagnosis but may be followed by treatment procedures in the same setting. Cerebral angiography is used to image various intracranial (within the head) or extracranial (outside the head) diseases.

Intracranial diseases are: non-traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, non-traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage, intracranial aneurysm, stroke, cerebral vasospasm, cerebral arteriovenous malformation (for Spetzler-Martin grading and plan for intervention), dural arteriovenous fistula, embolisation of brain tumours such as meningioma, cavernous sinus haemangioma, for Wada test, and to obtain haemodynamics of cerebral blood flow such as cross flow, circulation time, and collateral flow.

Extracranial diseases are: Subclavian steal syndrome, rupture of the carotid artery, carotid artery stenosis, cervical spine trauma, epistaxis (nose bleeding) and plan for embolisation of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma before operation.

Although computed tomography angiography (CTA) and Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been used widely in evaluation of intracranial disease, cerebral angiography provides higher resolution on the conditions of blood vessel lumens and vasculature. Cerebral angiography is also the standard of detecting intracranial aneurysm and evaluating the feasibility of endovascular coiling. Performing a cerebral angiogram by gaining access through the femoral artery or radial artery is feasible in order to treat cerebral aneurysms with a number of devices 

Certain conditions such as contrast allergy, renal insufficiency, and coagulation disorders are contraindicated in this procedure.

== Technique ==
Before the procedure, focused history and neurological examination is performed, available imaging, and blood parameters are reviewed. When reviewing imaging, arch anatomy and variants are evaluated to select suitable catheters to assess the vessels. Complete blood count is reviewed to ensure adequate amount of haemoglobin in subject&#x27;s body, and to rule out the presence of sepsis. Serum creatinine is assessed to rule out renal dysfunction. Meanwhile, prothrombin time is assessed to rule out coagulopathy. Informed consent regarding the risks of the procedure is taken. Anticoagulants are withheld if possible. Fasting is required 6 hours before the procedure and insulin requirement is reduced by half for those diabetics who are fasting. Bilateral groins (for femoral artery access) and left arm/forearm (for brachial artery/radial artery access) are prepared. Neurological status of the patient before sedation or anesthesia is recorded.

Sedation drug such as intravenous midazolam and painkiller such as fentanyl can be used if the subject is restless or painful. The subject is then lie down on supine position with arm at the sides. Uncooperative subjects may have their forehead tapped to reduce motion. The subject is advised to stay as still as possible especially when fluoroscopy images are taken. The subject is also advised to avoid swallowing when images of neck are taken. These measures are taken to reduce motion artifact in the images.

Right common femoral artery (RFA) is the preferred site of access. If RFA access is not optimal, then brachial artery access is chosen. Either a micropuncture system or an 18G access needle can be used with or without ultrasound guidance. There are four types of catheters that can be used: angled vertebral catheter for usual cases, Judkins right coronary catheter (Terumo) for tourtous vessels, Simmons&#x27;s catheter and Mani&#x27;s head hunter catheter (Terumo) for extremely tortous vessels. A 5Fr sheath is also placed within and flushed with heparinised saline to prevent clotting around the sheath. In terms of guidewire, Terumo hydrophilic Glidewire 0.035 inches can be used.

To prevent embolism (either due to blood clot or air embolism, &quot;double flush&quot; and &quot;wet connect&quot; techniques are used. In &quot;double flush&quot; technique, a saline syringe is used to aspirate blood from the catheter. Then, a second heparinised saline syringe is used to flush the catheter. &quot;Wet connect&quot; is the technique that connects syringe to a sheath without air bubbles within.

Digital subtraction angiography is the main technique of imaging the cerebral blood vessels. Catheter should be advanced over the guidewire. Rotating the catheter during advancement is also helpful. Roadmap (superimposing previous image on live fluoroscopic image) is used to advance catheters or guidewires before any vessel bifurcation can help to prevent vessel dissection. After the catheter is in position, guidewire is removed slowly with heparinised saline dripping into the catheter at the same time to prevent air embolism. Prior to contrast injection, backflow of the catheter should be established to ensure there is no wedging, dissection, or intracatheter clotting. During the catheterisation of vertebral artery, extra care should be taken to prevent vessel dissection or vasospasm. Delayed or incomplete contrast washout may indicate vasospasm or dissection.

===Radiographic views===
Cervical arch angiogram is taken if there is any suspicion of aortic arch narrowing, or any anatomical variants such as bovine arch (brachiocephalic trunk shares a common origin with left common carotid artery). If such abnormality is present, it results it difficulty in cannulation of the main branches of the aortic arch. The catheter of choice to cannulate this area is pigtail catheter with multiple side holes. Contrast injection rate of 20 to 25ml/sec is given with total volume of 40 to 50 ml of contrast. The frame rate of fluoroscopy is 4 to 6 frames per second. The image is taken in with the x-ray tube in left anterior oblique position.

To image the vessels of the neck such as common carotid, internal and external carotid arteries, AP, lateral, and 45 degrees bilateral oblique positions are taken. Contrast injection rate is 3 to 4 ml/sec with total volume of 7 to 9 ml. The frame rate of fluoroscopy is 3 to 4 frames/sec.

To image the anterior cerebral circulation such as internal and external carotid arteries and its branches, AP, Towne&#x27;s and lateral views are taken. The petrous part of the temporal bone should be superimposed at the mid or lower orbits when taking the AP/Towne&#x27;s view. Contrast injection rate is 6 to 7 ml/sec with total volume of contrast at 10 ml. The frame rate of fluoroscopy is 2 to 4 frames/sec. Neck extension can help to navigate into tortous cerival part of the internal carotid artery.

At the level of carotid bifurcation, AP and oblique images are taken. At the cavernous (C4) and ophthalmic segments (C6) of the internal carotid artery, Caldwell and lateral views are taken. At the supraclinoid segment (C5-clinoid, C6-ophthalmic, and C7-bifurcation to posterior communicating artery (PCOM) segments), AP view is used to access the terminal branches such as anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA) while oblique view (25 to 35 degrees) is used to access the ACA, anterior communicating artery (ACOM), and MCA bifurcations. Lateral view is useful to visualise the PCOM while submentovertical view is useful to project ACOM above the nasal cavity, thus making it easier to access the anatomy of ACOM. Transorbital oblique view is useful to access the MCA anatomy.

The anatomy of external carotid artery is access via AP and lateral views.

To image the posterior circulation, such as vertebral and basilar arteries, AP, Towne&#x27;s view, lateral projections near the back of the head and upper part of the neck is taken. In this case, petrous bone should be projected at the bottom or below the orbits to visualise the basilar artery and its branches in AP/Towne&#x27;s view. The rate of injection is 3 to 5 ml/sec, for a total of 8ml. The fluoroscope will be catching images at a rate of 2 to 4 frames per second. Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) can be seen in AP view. The left vertebral artery is easier to cannulate than the right vertebral because of the straightforward anatomy of the left vertebral artery.

Any activation of primary collateral system (ACOM and PCOM arteries) or secondary collateral system (pial-pial and leptomeningeal-dural) in case of occlusion of internal carotid artery should also be documented. Leptomeningeal collaterals or pial collaterals are the small arterial connections that join the terminal branches of ACAs, MCAs, and PCAs on the surface of the brain.

===Post-procedural care===
Manual compression or percutaneous closure device can be used to stop the bleeding from common femoral artery. Groin haematoma should be monitored during intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring. The puncture should be immobilised (to prevent movement) for 24 hours post puncture. Neurological examination should be performed and new neurological deficit should be documented. Significant neurological changes should be evaluated with MRI scan or a repeat cerebral angiography to rule out acute stroke or vessel dissection. Painkiller should be administered if there is any puncture site pain.

== Complications ==
The most common complication is groin haematoma which occurs in 4% of those affected. Neurologic complications such as transient ischemic attack in 2.5% of the cases. There is also the risk of stroke with permanent neurological defect in 0.1% of the cases and may lead to death in 0.06%. Rarely, 0.3 to 1% of the cases experience cortical blindness from 3 minutes to 12 hours after the procedure. It is a condition where those affected experienced loss of vision with normal pupillary light reflex, and normal extraocular muscles movement. The condition can sometimes be accompanied by headaches, mental state changes, and memory losses.

Some risk factors of complications are if the subject is having subarachnoid haemorrhage, atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, frequent transient ischemic attacks, age more than 55 years, and poorly controlled diabetes. Besides, longer procedures, increased in number of catheter exchanges, and the use of larger size of catheters also increases the risk of complications.

== History ==
In 1896, E. Haschek and O.T. Lindenthal in Vienna, Austria, reported angiography of blood vessels by taking a series of X-rays after injecting a mixture of petroleum, quicklime, and mercuric sulfide into the hand of a cadaver.

Cerebral angiography was first described by Egas Moniz, a Portuguese physician and politician, in 1927. He performed this procedure on six patients. Two developed Horner&#x27;s syndrome due to leaking of contrast material around the carotid artery, one developed temporary aphasia, and another died due to thromboembolism to the anterior circulation of the brain.

Prior to the 1970s the typical technique involved a needle puncture directly into the carotid artery, as depicted in the 1973 horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, which was replaced by the current method of threading a catheter from a distant artery due to common complications caused by trauma to the artery at the puncture site in the neck (particularly hematomas of the neck, with possible compromission of the airway).

<text>George Robert Gleig (20 April 1796 – 9 July 1888) was a Scottish soldier, military writer, and priest.

==Life==
Gleig was born in Stirling, Scotland. His parents were George Gleig (1753–1840, Bishop of Brechin from October 1808) and Janet, née Hamilton, youngest daughter of Robert Hamilton of Kilbrackmont. Gleig received his initial education at Stirling Grammar school.

On 21 June 1813, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington had his last major victory in Spain over the French, at the battle of Vitoria. One month later a young student of divinity, George Robert Gleig, gave up a scholarship to Balliol College to join Wellington&#x27;s army as an Ensign in the 85th Light Infantry. His father, by then Bishop of Brechin, furnished him with £20, a substantial sum, though he notes that the rate at which he could buy readily exchangeable gold coins was poor — he had to pay 6s for every gold dollar, and £5 for a doubloon. On 7 October, Wellington crossed into France for the first time.

On 6 April 1814, Napoleon abdicated, though Wellington did not find out until 12 April. By then, on 10 April he had fought and won the decisive battle of the war at Toulouse. The young divinity student was then sent to the war against the United States, where he fought in five battles (Bladensburg, Baltimore, New Orleans, Washington and Fort Bowyer) and was three times wounded. After peace broke out he resumed his scholarship at Magdalen Hall, Oxford in 1816.

Gleig married Sarah Cameron in 1819, while at Oxford. She was a daughter of Captain Cameron the younger of Kinlochleven. Having taken his B.A. and M.A., the young Gleig took holy orders in 1820. He became curate of Westwell, Kent, and was later appointed to two additional parishes, as curate of Ash and as Rector of Ivychurch.

He wrote a series of articles for Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine on his Peninsular War experiences; they were collected into a book, published in 1825 as &quot;The Subaltern&quot;. In 1821 he authored an account of his experiences in the USA as &quot;The Campaigns of the British Army at Washington and New Orleans under Generals Ross, Pakenham and Lambert&quot;. In 1829 he was invited to meet Wellington, and became a regular house-guest of the Duke. Gleig also wrote &quot;The Life of the Duke of Wellington&quot;; a revised edition was published by Longmans, Green &amp; Co of London in 1890.

In 1832 George Robert Gleig, by then Chaplain at Royal Hospital Chelsea  to the Chelsea pensioners—and a well-known author, mainly on military matters, publicly opposed the Reform Bill before Parliament.

Gleig had excellent relations with the Duke of Wellington, but that did not stop the Iron Duke from issuing a public reprimand in 1840 to Gleig for his plan to educate NCOs and private soldiers:

By Jove! If there is a mutiny in the army – and in all probability we shall have one – you&#x27;ll see that these new-fangled schoolmasters will be at the bottom of it.

Gleig was appointed Chaplain-General of the Forces in 1844, resigned 1875; from 1846 to 1857 he was Inspector-General of Military Schools. From 27 March 1848, he was a member of the Canterbury Association and joined the management committee, but resigned again on 25 November 1851.

Gleig was a frequent contributor to reviews and magazines, especially &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, in which his best-known novel, &quot;The Subaltern&quot;, appeared in installments. He was also the author of &quot;Lives of Warren Hastings, Robert Clive, and Wellington&quot;, &quot;Military Commanders&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Pensioners&quot;, and other works.

He died at Stratfield Turgis, Hampshire in 1888.

=== As editor ===

These 2 books are curiosities. In the first Gleig explains he is putting his name to the book to help the young author achieve recognition she deserves. In the second, the author has died, obviously soon after the first book has been published and Gleig has put his name to the posthumous work, which otherwise would not have been published. Of the author Harriette Campbell, we know very little as Gleig refuses to tell. He promised a work on her life but this was never forthcoming. The author also had another novel &#x27;Cardinal Virtues&#x27;, posthumously printed by J.W. Parker in 1841, but Gleig had no connection with this work.

* &quot;The Only Daughter; a domestic story.&quot; 1839. London: : Henry Colburn. 3 volumes. ix+308pp, ii+296pp, ii+271pp.In the introduction, Gleig explains why he is putting his name to a book which is not written by himself.
* &quot;Self-Devotion, or The history of Katherine Randolph.&quot; 1842 Henry Colburn: London. 3 volumes. viii+284pp, iv+285pp, ii+293pp. Gleig explains briefly in a preface why he is producing another of Miss Campbell&#x27;s books under his own name.

<text>The Kidnap Murder Case is a 1936 murder mystery novel by S. S. Van Dine, the tenth of twelve books featuring fictional detective Philo Vance.

==Plot summary==
A member of the wealthy Kenting family is kidnapped, and Philo Vance&#x27;s suspicions lead him to the victim&#x27;s home, the &quot;Purple House&quot; on New York&#x27;s 86th Street. A mysterious ransom note and the family collection of gems both play a part in the plot, which ends with the murderer&#x27;s suicide with the connivance of Vance. &quot;To be sure, the motive for the crime, or, I should say, crimes, was the sordid one of monetary gain ... through Vance&#x27;s determination and fearlessness, through his keen insight into human nature and his amazing flair for the ramifications of human psychology, he was able to penetrate beyond the seemingly conclusive manifestations of the case.&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==
Crime novelist and critic Julian Symons wrote, &quot;The decline in the last six Vance books is so steep that the critic who called the ninth of them one more stitch in his literary shroud was not overstating the case.&quot;

<doc id="1078475" wikidata="Q7737428" url="?curid=1078475" title="The Gracie Allen Murder Case">
<text>The Gracie Allen Murder Case (1938) (also published as &quot;The Scent of Murder&quot;) is the eleventh of twelve detective novels by S. S. Van Dine featuring his famous fictional detective of the 1920s and 1930s, Philo Vance. It also features the zany half of the Burns and Allen comedy team. It is in some ways a roman à clef, including not just Burns and Allen but also such characters as Gracie&#x27;s mother and brother. (George Burns, after all, has described the couple&#x27;s act as, &quot;All I had to do was ask, &#x27;Gracie, how&#x27;s your brother?&#x27; and she talked for 38 years.&quot;) That gave the book an unusual feel, as did the comic tone of much of Gracie&#x27;s dialogue. This tone suddenly shifts in a later chapter to one character&#x27;s philosophically anguished speculations, and then back again to Gracie.

==Literary significance and criticism==
For some readers the whole thing works oddly wonderfully, and shows S. S. Van Dine&#x27;s skill at combining his traditional approach with some unusual forms. Other readers found this book both disconcerting and disappointing. It did not enjoy anything near the commercial success of Van Dine&#x27;s earlier novels (or his prime character, when Philo Vance himself was developed into a classic radio show), and most critics considered it a failure.

Those critics might have agreed with the protagonist herself. In classic Gracie style, when Van Dine was working on the novel, Allen quipped, &quot;S.S. Van Dine is silly to spend six months writing a novel when you can buy one for two dollars and ninety-eight cents.&quot;

Crime novelist and critic Julian Symons wrote, &quot;The decline in the last six Vance books is so steep that the critic who called the ninth of them one more stitch in his literary shroud was not overstating the case.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

The novel was adapted into a 1939 film starring Gracie Allen (who received billing above Warren William&#x27;s portrayal of Philo Vance) which was fairly faithful to the novel. The action stops in the first third when Gracie sings a song that at first seems to be her attempt to sing the first lines of a number of popular songs, each to the tune of another—a novelty song. The film focuses more on her humor than the murder plot, and Philo Vance, whom Gracie keeps calling &quot;Fido&quot; in the film, is relegated to a decidedly secondary role.

<text>The Winter Murder Case (1939) is a Philo Vance novella that S. S. Van Dine intended to expand into his twelfth full-length book, a project cut short by his death. &quot;The Winter Murder Case&quot; seems especially similar to the B mystery movies of the 1930s, a cross between Van Dine&#x27;s usual style and the film style. It was intended as a vehicle for Sonja Henie.

Van Dine&#x27;s last two books were intended as Hollywood scenarios. Both are shorter than Van Dine&#x27;s typical novels.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;The decline in the last six Vance books is so steep that the critic who called the ninth of them one more stitch in his literary shroud was not overstating the case.&quot; wrote Julian Symons in &quot;Bloody Murder&quot;.

&quot;This is [Van Dine&#x27;s] last work, left in an only semi-expanded outline form at the time of his death. Philo Vance is still the detective but the pseudo-scholarly footnotes are not in evidence nor is the pearl-handled telephone. In fact, this short book is pleasant reading; add your own nostalgia if you wish.&quot;, according to Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor in &quot;A Catalogue of Crime&quot;.

<text>The East Los Angeles Interchange is an interchange complex located in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) east of Downtown Los Angeles. With its southern portion handling over 550,000 vehicles per day (2008 AADT), it is the busiest freeway interchange in the world. The northern portion, called the San Bernardino Split, is often considered a separate interchange. Four numbered routes converge at the interchange: Interstate 5 (I-5), I-10, U.S. Route 101 (US 101), and State Route 60 (SR 60), but the freeway segments shift alignments and directions.

The interchange was named the Eugene A. Obregon Memorial Interchange to honor U.S. Marine Corps member and Medal of Honor recipient Eugene A. Obregon.

==Description==
At the time of its construction in the early 1960s, the East Los Angeles Interchange was considered a civil engineering marvel. Located along the east bank of the Los Angeles River in the Los Angeles district of Boyle Heights, east of Downtown Los Angeles, the interchange comprises six freeway segments; that is, there are six freeway paths of travel into the complex. The actual number of numbered highways intersecting at this interchange is four:
* 
* 

The interchange is so complex because the intersecting freeways shift alignments and directions:
* I-5 (originally US 101) enters the complex from the south as the Santa Ana Freeway, but exits to the north as the Golden State Freeway. The Santa Ana Freeway continues west as US 101 toward the Four Level Interchange (Bill Keene Memorial Interchange) in downtown Los Angeles.
* I-10 (originally US 70 &quot;Ramona Freeway&quot; [sic] / US 60) is not contiguous through the interchange. Heading west into the complex on the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10), the trunk road heads to US 101 at the San Bernardino Split. In order to follow the I-10 alignment, one must exit the trunk road and follow a connector that merges with the alignment of southbound I-5, then exit that trunk and follow another connector to the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10).
* Heading west into the complex on the Pomona Freeway (SR 60), the primary road (or trunk) heads into the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10).

There is not complete freedom of movement within the interchange. Traffic flowing into it on certain freeways cannot leave it on all of the others.
* There is no direct connector from the westbound Pomona Freeway (SR 60) to the southbound Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) (and vice versa); travelers wanting to make this transition must exit at the Pomona Freeway&#x27;s interchange with the Long Beach Freeway (I-710) located to the east, head south, and then transition to the Santa Ana Freeway at the interchange between those two freeways.
* There is no direct connector from the southbound Santa Ana Freeway (US 101) to the northbound Golden State Freeway (I-5) (and vice versa); travelers wanting to make this transition must exit at the Four Level Interchange with the Arroyo Seco Parkway (SR 110, northeast from this interchange) located to the west, head northeast, and then transition to the Golden State Freeway at the interchange between those two freeways.
* There is no direct connector from the southbound Santa Ana Freeway (US 101) to the westbound Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) (and vice versa); travelers wanting to make this transition must exit at the Four Level Interchange with the Harbor Freeway (SR 110, southwest from this interchange) located to the west, head southwest, and then transition to the Santa Monica Freeway at the Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Memorial Interchange.

Further complication is caused by the varying designs of each intersecting freeway and their related transition roads. Some have four lanes and are relatively straight and wide, while others have one lane, are narrow, or have curves with tighter radii or cambers. Traffic congestion is thus exacerbated as vehicles moving at high speed on the wider transition roads try to merge with slower moving vehicles coming from the narrow transition roads.

==History==

Construction of the freeway interchange began in 1961. The vastness of the structure and the complexity of its many routes called for a $17,000 blueprint model of the highway. It has thirty-two bridges and twenty walls with of earth being excavated. The project laid of concrete pipe, used of concrete and of reinforcing and structural steel.

==In popular culture==
Although not commonly called such by residents and other reporters, the freeway intersection was often called &quot;Malfunction Junction&quot; by former KNX traffic reporter Bill Keene, because of its complicated interchange structure. The interchange has also been referred to as &quot;The Beast&quot; L.A. Interchange and the &quot;East Delay&quot; Interchange, names attributed to KNX&#x27;s Jim Thornton, as well as the &quot;Nickel/Dime&quot; during traffic reports.

<doc id="1078483" wikidata="Q547941" url="?curid=1078483" title="Dale Messick">
<text>Dalia Messick (April 11, 1906 – April 5, 2005) was an American comic strip artist who used the pseudonym Dale Messick. She was the creator of &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot;, which at its peak during the 1950s ran in 250 newspapers.

==Early life==
Messick was born in South Bend, Indiana, on April 11, 1906. Her father, Cephas Messick, was a sign painter and vocational arts teacher. Her mother Bertha was a milliner and seamstress; her work inspired some of the glamorous hats used in the Brenda Starr strip. After her family moved to Hobart, Indiana, Messick, who repeated third and eighth grades, attended Hobart High School, earning her diploma at age 20. She studied for one summer at the Ray Commercial Art School in Chicago, but left to begin a career as a professional artist.

==Greeting cards==
Messick began working for a Chicago greeting card company and was successful but quit when her boss lowered her pay during the Great Depression. In 1933, she moved to New York City where she found work with another greeting card company at a higher salary, $50 a week, sending nearly half of it back to her family in Indiana. She recalled, &quot;I had $30 a week to live it up. You could walk down 42nd Street and have bacon and eggs and toast and coffee and hash brown potatoes and orange juice—the works—for 25 cents.&quot;

==Comic strips==
She began assembling a portfolio of comic strip samples. Messick was not the first female comic strip creator; Nell Brinkley, Gladys Parker and Edwina Dumm had all achieved success in the field, but there was still a bias against women. Messick decided to change her first name to the androgynous &quot;Dale&quot; so her work would be seen by editors. She created a variety of comic strips (&quot;Weegee&quot;, &quot;Mimi the Mermaid&quot;, &quot;Peg and Pudy, the Struglettes&quot;, &quot;Streamline Babies&quot;), but none was selected for publication.

==&quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot;==
Messick created the character of Brenda Starr in 1940, naming it after 1930s debutante Brenda Frazier, and basing her appearance on Rita Hayworth. Messick wanted to produce a strip with a female protagonist; she decided a career as a reporter would allow her character to travel and have adventures, albeit adventures more glamorous than those actually experienced by most reporters. She said in a 1986 article in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, &quot;I used to get letters from girl reporters saying that their lives were nowhere near as exciting as Brenda&#x27;s. I told them that if I made Brenda&#x27;s life like theirs, nobody would read it.&quot;

Her break came when she came to the attention of another woman, Mollie Slott, who worked as a &quot;girl Friday&quot; for &quot;New York Daily News&quot; publisher (and syndicate head) Joseph Medill Patterson. Patterson, reputedly biased against female cartoonists, would not sign her up for daily publication in the &quot;News&quot;, but he accepted &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot; for syndication as a Sunday comic, and it made its debut on June 30, 1940. The strip was an immediate success, since the mix of adventure and romance was popular with both male and female readers. By 1945, the strip was syndicated nationally and published daily.

Messick stopped drawing the strip in 1980 and ended her role writing the script two years later. Ramona Fradon (artist) and Linda Sutter (writer) took over production of the strip. Mary Schmich took over as writer in 1985, and June Brigman as artist in 1995. The final strip was published on January 2, 2011. Messick was not impressed with her successors&#x27; versions of Starr, according to a 1998 quote in the &quot;Sonoma County Independent&quot;: &quot;Now it doesn&#x27;t look like Brenda at all. She looks more like she works at a bank. No glamour, no curves, no fashion — but it&#x27;s still going pretty good.&quot;.

==Other endeavors==
Messick worked on other comic strips, but none achieved the success of &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot;. The only other strip which she worked on which is generally remembered was &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, which she illustrated.

On April 24, 1955, she appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; After Dorothy Kilgallen correctly identified her as a comic strip artist, the panel was given a full description of her real name, professional name and job as &quot;illustrator&quot; of &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot;.

On May 5, 1960, Messick appeared as a contestant on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. None of the panelists correctly identified her.

==Accolades==
In 1995, &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot; was one of 20 comic strips honored by a series of United States postage stamps; Messick was the only living creator. She received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Story Comic Book Award for 1975 and their Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997 for her work on &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot;. Messick was inducted into the Friends of Lulu Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 1998. She was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2001; she and Marie Severin were the first women to be so inducted.

==Personal life==
Messick was married twice. With first husband, Everette George Soltmann, she had one child, a daughter named Starr. Messick later married attorney Oscar Strom. Both marriages ended in divorce.

Following her retirement from &quot;Brenda Starr, Reporter&quot;, Messick moved to Oakmont, California, to be near her daughter and grandchildren. She continued to work, creating a strip, &quot;Granny Glamour&quot;, which ran in &quot;Oakmont Gardens Magazine&quot;, a local weekly magazine. It ended after she had a stroke in 1998 and could no longer draw. At the time of her death, she was being cared for by her daughter in Penngrove, Sonoma County, California.

Messick died on April 5, 2005, aged 98, in Sonoma County, California.

<doc id="1078489" wikidata="Q2391786" url="?curid=1078489" title="Going to California">
<text>&quot;Going to California&quot; is a ballad recorded by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was released on their untitled fourth album in 1971.

In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Going to California&quot; number 11 on their list of the 40 greatest Led Zeppelin songs of all time.

==Composition==
&quot;Going to California&quot; is a folk-style song, with Robert Plant on vocal, acoustic guitar by Jimmy Page and mandolin by John Paul Jones. Page uses an alternative guitar tuning (D–A–D–G–B–D or double drop D tuning) for the recording.

The song started out as a song about Californian earthquakes and when Jimmy Page, audio engineer Andy Johns and band manager Peter Grant travelled to Los Angeles to mix &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;, they coincidentally experienced a minor earthquake. At this point it was known as &quot;Guide to California&quot;. 

According to music writer Nick DeRiso, Joni Mitchell also inspired the song: &quot;Plant makes a clear reference to &#x27;I Had a King&#x27;, the opening song from Mitchell&#x27;s debut album, 1968&#x27;s &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot;: &#x27;To find a queen without a king&#x27;, he quietly offers in the final verse. &#x27;They say she plays guitar, cries and sings. In an interview for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, Plant admitted that it &quot;might be a bit embarrassing at times lyrically, but it did sum up a period of my life when I was 22.&quot;

==Performances==
At Led Zeppelin concerts the band performed this song during their acoustic sets, first playing it on their Spring 1971 tour of the United Kingdom. One live version, from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s performance at Earls Court in 1975, is featured on disc 2 of the &quot;Led Zeppelin DVD&quot; and again on the &quot;Mothership&quot; DVD. The song was also performed at all shows on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s mammoth 1977 US tour.

It was performed on Plant&#x27;s solo tours during 1988/1989 and at the Knebworth Silver Clef show in 1990. He played it again on his &quot;Mighty ReArranger&quot; tour, with additions of a double bass and a synthesiser.

The Black Crowes and Slash performed a cover of the song on January 30, 2025 at Kia Forum in Inglewood, California for FireAid to help with relief efforts for the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.

==Other versions==
A different version of this song is featured on the second disc of the remastered 2CD deluxe edition of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;. Known as &quot;Going to California (Mandolin/Guitar Mix)&quot;, it is an instrumental recorded on 29 January 1971, with the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio at Headley Grange with engineer Andy Johns.

==Personnel==
According to Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin:

* Robert Plant – vocals
* Jimmy Page – acoustic guitars (six-string and twelve-string)
* John Paul Jones – mandolin

<doc id="1078494" wikidata="Q3472450" url="?curid=1078494" title="Alzada, Montana">
<text>Alzada (also known as Stoneville and Telegraph Point) is a census-designated place in southern Carter County, Montana, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 29. It is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 212 with Montana Secondary Highways 323 and 326, near the Wyoming and South Dakota borders. The Little Missouri River flows northwards to the west of the community. Alzada is in the Mountain Time Zone.

==History==
Alzada was first established in 1878, by 9th U.S. Infantry soldiers as Camp Devin, on the Deadwood, Dakota Territory to Fort Keogh, Montana Territory telegraph line. It was called the Little Missouri River Telegraph Station, and manned by soldiers of the 7th U.S. Cavalry. Then it was named Stoneville, after the local bartender Lou Stone. It served as a stagecoach stop between Deadwood and Miles City, Montana. It was the site of a gun battle in 1884 between local authorities and rustlers known as the Axleby gang. The town&#x27;s name was changed from Stoneville in 1885, because of confusion with another similarly named community. The name &quot;Alzada&quot; came from an early settler named Laura Alzada Shelden. Later settlers of the area were largely homesteaders.

In 1890, Private Peter Thompson, a 7th Cavalry survivor and recipient of the Medal of Honor for the Battle of the Little Bighorn, moved from Lead, Dakota Territory, with his brother William and homesteaded north of Alzada on the Little Missouri River at Nine Mile Creek.

Alzada was briefly in the news in September 1997, when a B-1 bomber crashed nearby.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Alzada has a semi-arid climate, abbreviated &quot;BSk&quot; on climate maps.

There is a weather station located in the nearby community of Albion.

<text>An intelligence gathering network is a system through which information about a particular entity is collected for the benefit of another through the use of more than one, inter-related source. Such information may be gathered by a military intelligence, government intelligence, or commercial intelligence network.

Intelligence assessment employs intelligence analysis to refine information. Foreign embassies subscribe to the newspapers and keep tabs on the news channels of their host countries — the information doesn&#x27;t have to be classified to be considered useful intelligence; indeed, so-called OSINT, or open-source intelligence, is increasing in both quantity and utility with the ascendancy of digital media. Researchers may also be employed to dig through archives and check facts. An important form of intelligence is so-called &quot;signals intelligence&quot;, which attempts to intercept electronic communications and other signals sent between parties working for a hostile, or potentially hostile, entity, or between neutral or even friendly parties but &quot;discussing&quot; that entity.

In established intelligence agencies, such networks usually follow a linear rather than distributed structure. An agent handler directs the activities of a number of persons and sources in order to obtain the necessary facts about the target of the intelligence gathering operation. The two main HUMINT agent types used are &quot;infiltration&quot; and &quot;penetration&quot; agents. An infiltration agent is someone who enters the target of the operation from the outside, but on a suitable pretext so that they are not suspected of espionage. A penetration agent would already be in place in the target area, and is recruited by the handler, often by means of the MICE principle. The information so gathered is processed by one or more analysts and turned into an intelligence product. Information is conveyed between nodes of the network by a variety of secure/clandestine means, be they physical or electronic.

==History==

===Turkey===

At the turn of the twentieth century, the last Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, demanded daily intelligence reports called &quot;djournals&quot; (from the word &quot;journal). After decades, he had saved millions of them in &quot;a whole building to itself in the War Office, where a Government Commission is now,&quot; Francis McCullagh wrote in 1910, &quot;wading slowly through this amazing accumulation.&quot;

<text>The Memba are a people of Arunachal Pradesh. The Memba population is currently around four to five thousand. Local genealogies suggested that they came from Tibet and settled in the region several centuries ago.

The Membas follow Nyingmapa Tibetan Buddhism and have their own script, Hikor, which is derived from the Tibetan script. In every village, there is a small Gompa presided by a Buddhist Lama. As devout Buddhists, they follow all the intricate details of rituals of Buddhist puja, hoisting at least a Buddhist prayer flag or a string of small Buddhist prayer flags in front of every household. Festivals that are celebrated by the Memba include Losar and Choskar.

<doc id="1078521" wikidata="Q1848968" url="?curid=1078521" title="Shapiro time delay">
<text>The Shapiro time delay effect, or gravitational time delay effect, is one of the four classic Solar System tests of general relativity. Radar signals passing near a massive object take slightly longer to travel to a target and longer to return than they would if the mass of the object were not present. The time delay is caused by time dilation, which increases the time it takes light to travel a given distance from the perspective of an outside observer. In a 1964 article entitled &quot;Fourth Test of General Relativity&quot;, Irwin Shapiro wrote:
Because, according to the general theory, the speed of a light wave depends on the strength of the gravitational potential along its path, these time delays should thereby be increased by almost sec when the radar pulses pass near the sun. Such a change, equivalent to 60 km in distance, could now be measured over the required path length to within about 5 to 10% with presently obtainable equipment.
Throughout this article discussing the time delay, Shapiro uses &quot;c&quot; as the speed of light and calculates the time delay of the passage of light waves or rays over finite coordinate distance according to a Schwarzschild solution to the Einstein field equations.

== History ==
The time delay effect was first predicted in 1964, by Irwin Shapiro. Shapiro proposed an observational test of his prediction: bounce radar beams off the surface of Venus and Mercury and measure the round-trip travel time. When the Earth, Sun, and Venus are most favorably aligned, Shapiro showed that the expected time delay, due to the presence of the Sun, of a radar signal traveling from the Earth to Venus and back, would be about 200 microseconds, well within the limitations of 1960s-era technology.

The first tests, performed in 1966 and 1967 using the MIT Haystack radar antenna, were successful, matching the predicted amount of time delay. The experiments have been repeated many times since then, with increasing accuracy.

== Calculating time delay ==

In a nearly static gravitational field of moderate strength (say, of stars and planets, but not one of a black hole or close binary system of neutron stars) the effect may be considered as a special case of gravitational time dilation. The measured elapsed time of a light signal in a gravitational field is longer than it would be without the field, and for moderate-strength nearly static fields the difference is directly proportional to the classical gravitational potential, precisely as given by standard gravitational time dilation formulas.

=== Time delay due to light traveling around a single mass ===
Shapiro&#x27;s original formulation was derived from the Schwarzschild solution and included terms to the first order in solar mass (formula_1) for a proposed Earth-based radar pulse bouncing off an inner planet and returning passing close to the Sun:
: formula_2
where formula_3 is the distance of closest approach of the radar wave to the center of the Sun, formula_4 is the distance along the line of flight from the Earth-based antenna to the point of closest approach to the Sun, and formula_5 represents the distance along the path from this point to the planet. The right-hand side of this equation is primarily due to the variable speed of the light ray; the contribution from the change in path, being of second order in formula_1, is negligible. formula_7 is the Landau symbol of order of error.

For a signal going around a massive object, the time delay can be calculated as the following:
: formula_8

Here formula_9 is the unit vector pointing from the observer to the source, and formula_10 is the unit vector pointing from the observer to the gravitating mass formula_1. The dot denotes the usual Euclidean dot product.

Using formula_12, this formula can also be written as
: formula_13
which is a fictive extra distance the light has to travel. Here formula_14 is the Schwarzschild radius.

In PPN parameters,
: formula_15
which is twice the Newtonian prediction (with formula_16).

The doubling of the Shapiro factor can be explained by the fact that there is not only the gravitational time dilation, but also the radial stretching of space, both of which contribute equally in general relativity for the time delay as they also do for the deflection of light.
: formula_17
: formula_18
: formula_19
: formula_20

== Interplanetary probes ==
Shapiro delay must be considered along with ranging data when trying to accurately determine the distance to interplanetary probes such as the Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft.

== Shapiro delay of neutrinos and gravitational waves ==
From the nearly simultaneous observations of neutrinos and photons from SN 1987A, the Shapiro delay for high-energy neutrinos must be the same as that for photons to within 10%, consistent with recent estimates of the neutrino mass, which imply that those neutrinos were moving at very close to the speed of light. After the direct detection of gravitational waves in 2016, the one-way Shapiro delay was calculated by two groups and is about 1800 days. In general relativity and other metric theories of gravity, though, the Shapiro delay for gravitational waves is expected to be the same as that for light and neutrinos. However, in theories such as tensor–vector–scalar gravity and other modified GR theories, which reproduce Milgrom&#x27;s law and avoid the need for dark matter, the Shapiro delay for gravitational waves is much smaller than that for neutrinos or photons. The observed 1.7-second difference in arrival times seen between gravitational wave and gamma ray arrivals from neutron star merger GW170817 was far less than the estimated Shapiro delay of about 1000 days. This rules out a class of modified models of gravity that dispense with the need for dark matter.

<text>Walter Goodall (1706? – 1766) was a Scottish historical writer, born in Banffshire, and educated at King&#x27;s College, University of Aberdeen. Later he became assistant librarian to the Advocates&#x27; Library in Edinburgh.

In 1754 Goodall published an &quot;Examination of the Letters said to have been written by Mary Queen of Scots&quot; on Casket letters. Printing the letters, he contested their authenticity. He also edited John of Fordun&#x27;s &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; (1759).

==Life==
He was the eldest son of John Goodall, a farmer in Banffshire. He was educated at King&#x27;s College, Old Aberdeen, which he entered in 1723, but left without taking a degree. In 1730 he obtained employment in the Advocates&#x27; Library, Edinburgh, and in 1735 became sub-librarian.

Goodall died in poverty 28 July 1766.

==Works==
Walter Goodall aided the principal librarian Thomas Ruddiman in the compilation of the catalogue of the Advocates&#x27; Library, printed in 1742.

In 1753 Goodall edited a new issue of the garbled &quot;Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland&quot;, originally published by David Crawford. His interest in the partisan &quot;Memoirs&quot; was connected with the favourable representation they contained of the career of Queen Mary. He planned to write her life, and published in 1754, in two volumes, an &quot;Examination of the Letters said to be written by Mary Queen of Scots to James, Earl of Bothwell&quot;. This work presaged the apologist period of the literature relating to the queen.

In 1754 also, Goodall published an edition, with emendations, of Scot of Scotstarvet&#x27;s &quot;Staggering State of Scots Statesmen&quot;, and an edition of James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich&#x27;s &quot;Practicks&quot;, with preface and life. He assisted Robert Keith in the preparation of his &quot;New Catalogue of Scottish Bishops&quot;, for which he supplied the preliminary account of the Culdees. He denied that the Scotia of the early writers was Ireland (not Scotland), and that those first termed Scoti were really emigrants from Ireland; he affirmed that Ireland&#x27;s other ancient name Ierne belonged also to Scotland. The &quot;glacialis Ierne&quot;, which, according to Claudian, wept for her slain Scots, was in his opinion the valley of Strathearn, the seat of an ancient Celtic earldom.

Goodall published in 1759 an edition of Fordun&#x27;s &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;, with a Latin introduction on the antiquities of Scotland, and a dissertation on the marriage of Robert III. An English translation of the introduction appeared separately in 1769.

<text>A 12-car rally is a type of car rally, often run by motor clubs as a simple and strictly amateur form of the sport.

12-car rallies are run to Navigational Rally rules, which are based on navigational skills rather than speed, and with usually a notable social element too. In the United Kingdom, the rules for 12-cars are governed by Motorsport UK and are as follows:

* Maximum of 12 competing vehicles per event (hence the name)
* Generally only standard road cars permitted, not fully prepared cars (this is at the discretion of the organising club, but is widely upheld)
* Maximum 30 mph average speed only
* &quot;Plot &#x27;n&#x27; bash&quot; navigation only
* No timing to the second permitted, only to the previous minute
* &quot;PR&quot; (public relations) work as necessary if the route affects residential areas, this is as for a road rally but the requirements are not quite as strict
* Police to be informed of the event, though route information does not need to be submitted and approved
* Route authorisation must be granted from the Motorsport UK&#x27;s local representative.

<text>Richard Grafton (c. 1506/7 or 1511 – 1573) was King&#x27;s Printer under Henry VIII and Edward VI. He was a member of the Grocers&#x27; Company and MP for Coventry elected 1562/63.

==Under Henry VIII==
With Edward Whitchurch, a member of the Haberdashers&#x27; Company, Grafton was interested in the printing of the Bible in English, and eventually they became printers and publishers, more by chance than by design. They published the Matthew Bible in 1537, though it was printed abroad. In 1538 they brought presses and printers from Paris to print the first edition of the Great Bible.

Whitchurch printed for a time in partnership with Grafton, who set up his press in the recently surrendered house of the Grey Friars, and in 1541 they obtained a joint exclusive privilege for printing the Church of England&#x27;s new liturgical books, including the first &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and the Edwardine Ordinals. Later, they were granted a privilege for printing primers in Latin and English.

Also 1541 Grafton was committed to Fleet Prison for printing a &quot;sedicious epistle of Melanctons&quot; and was also accused by the Privy Council of printing ballads defending the late Thomas Cromwell. In April 1543, he and seven other printers, among them Whitchurch, were sent to prison &quot;for printing such books as were thought to be unlawful&quot;. In Grafton&#x27;s case it was for having printed the Great Bible. He spent six weeks in prison and was bound in £300 neither to sell nor to print any more Bibles until the King and clergy should agree upon a translation.

==Under Edward VI and later life==
On the accession of Edward VI, Grafton was appointed King&#x27;s Printer and this gave him the sole right to print all Acts and Statutes. He had held the appointment for six years, when on the King&#x27;s death, he printed a proclamation of the accession of Lady Jane Grey, in which he signed himself &quot;Printer to the Queen.&quot; For this he was cast into prison by Mary I. John Cawood became Queen&#x27;s Printer, and Grafton&#x27;s career as a printer ended.

In prison Grafton compiled an &quot;Abridgement of the Chronicles of England&quot;, which he published in 1563. It includes the first published English version of the verse &quot;Thirty Days Hath September...&quot;, although manuscript versions have been found from the 15th century. To this he added in 1568–9 &quot;A Chronicle at Large&quot;. Neither holds a high place as authorities, as they lack original material. John Stow and Grafton had a running battle over their rival chronicles after Stow justifiably accused Grafton of copying his own work. In the &quot;Chronicle at Large&quot;, he is the earliest writer known to refer in print to Edward of Woodstock (Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall, Prince of Aquitaine) as the &quot;Black Prince&quot;. The origins of the name remain uncertain: Grafton said he had found it in other writers, and gives no further explanation.

Grafton was instrumental in the establishment and maintenance of the London hospitals. He died in 1573, probably in late April or early May, and was buried on 14 May in Christ Church Greyfriars in London, leaving four sons and one daughter, Joan, who married the printer Richard Tottel. Grafton&#x27;s device was a tree bearing grafts issuing from a tun or barrel of the kind in which books were packed for transport – hence &quot;graft-tun&quot;, an example of a rebus.

<text>Simon (or Simion) Grahame (c. 1570–1614), born in Edinburgh, Scotland, led a dissolute life as a traveller, soldier, and courtier on the Continent of Europe. He appears to have been a good scholar, and wrote the &quot;Passionate Sparke of a Relenting Minde&quot;, and &quot;Anatomy of Humours&quot;, the latter of which is believed to have suggested to Robert Burton his &quot;The Anatomy of Melancholy&quot;. He became an austere Franciscan.

A sonnet of Grahame&#x27;s was published as part of the preface to the &quot;Tragicall Death of Sophonisba, by David Murray, Scoto-Brittaine&quot;, John Smethwick, London (1611).

<text>The International Spy Museum is an independent non-profit history museum which documents the tradecraft, history, and contemporary role of espionage. It holds the largest collection of international espionage artifacts on public display. The museum opened in 2002 in the Penn Quarter neighborhood of Washington, D.C., and relocated to L&#x27;Enfant Plaza in 2019.

==History==

Milton Maltz, a code-breaker during the Korean War and founder of the Malrite Communications Group in 1956 (later The Malrite Company), conceptualized the International Spy Museum in 1996 as a for-profit organization. The original museum facility in the Penn Quarter neighborhood was built by Milton Maltz and The House on F Street, L.L.C. at a cost of approximately . It opened to the public in 2002. 

The foundation cost of the original museum was half funded by the Malrite Company; the other $20 million came from the District of Columbia through enterprise zone bonds and TIF bonds. The museum was part of the ongoing rejuvenation of Penn Quarter, kicked off in the 1980s by the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.

In April 2015, plans were released for a new museum designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. In January 2019, the museum began the process of moving from its previous F Street location to the new $162 million dedicated building at 700 L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, and it reopened to the public on May 12, 2019. The 32,000 square foot L&#x27;Enfant Plaza building has a 145-seat theater, rooftop terrace, and top-floor event space. The new museum is a non-profit enterprise.

Educational and cultural programs are offered for students, adults, and families including scholarly lectures, films, book signings, hands-on workshops, and group tour packages. The museum charges admission fees.

==Permanent collection==

The museum houses more than 7,000 artifacts with around 1,000 on public display, accompanied by historical photographs, interactive displays, film, and video. The permanent collection traces the complete history of espionage, from the Ancient Greeks and the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the British Empire, the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, the American Civil War, both World Wars, the Cold War, and through present day espionage activity. Exhibits include:

===Briefing Center===

Visitors receive an Undercover Mission badge and cover identity in the &quot;Briefing Center&quot;. Here, visitors preview the museum&#x27;s spy artifacts and watch a five-minute film introducing the shadow world of spying.

===Previous exhibits===
The museum had an interactive exhibit called Operation Spy where visitors assumed the roles of covert agents and participated in a one-hour Hollywood-style spy simulation. Visitors moved from area to area, interacting with puzzles, tasks, motion simulators, sound effects, and video messages to work through a mission to intercept a secret arms deal involving a nuclear trigger.

In 2011, the museum had an interactive called Spy in the City where visitors were given a GPS-type device and had to find clues near various landmarks in the area surrounding the museum to obtain the password for a secret weapon.

<doc id="1078548" wikidata="Q6134856" url="?curid=1078548" title="James Granger">
<text>James Granger (1723–1776) was an English clergyman, biographer, and print collector. He is now known as the author of the &quot;Biographical History of England from Egbert the Great to the Revolution&quot; (1769). Granger was an early advocate of animal rights.

==Life==

The son of William Granger, by Elizabeth Tutt, daughter of Tracy Tutt, he was born of poor parents at Shaftesbury, Dorset. On 26 April 1743 he matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, but left the university without taking a degree.

Having entered into holy orders, he was presented to the vicarage of Shiplake, Oxfordshire, living a quiet life there. His political views gave rise to Samuel Johnson&#x27;s remark: ‘The dog is a whig. I do not like much to see a whig in any dress, but I hate to see a whig in a parson&#x27;s gown.’ Preparation of the materials for his &quot;Biographical History&quot; brought him into correspondence with many collectors of engraved portraits and students of English biography.

In 1773 or 1774 he accompanied Lord Mountstuart on a tour to Holland, where his companion made an extensive collection of portraits. Some time before his death he tried unsuccessfully to obtain a living within a moderate distance of Shiplake. On Sunday, 14 April 1776, he performed divine service apparently in his usual health, but, while in the act of administering the sacrament, was seized with an apoplectic fit, and died next morning.

A portrait of him was in the possession of his brother, John Granger, who died at Basingstoke on 21 March 1810, aged 82. His collection of upwards of 14,000 engraved portraits was dispersed by Greenwood in 1778.

Before the publication of the first edition of Granger&#x27;s work in 1769 five shillings was considered a good price by collectors for any English portrait. 
After the appearance of the &quot;Biographical History&quot;, books, ornamented with engraved portraits, rose in price to five times their original value, and few could be found unmutilated. 
In 1856, Joseph Lilly and Joseph Willis, booksellers, each offered for sale an illustrated copy of Granger&#x27;s work. Lilly&#x27;s copy, which included Noble&#x27;s &#x27;Continuation,&#x27; was illustrated by more than thirteen hundred portraits, bound in 27 vols., price £42. 
The price of Willis&#x27;s copy, which contained more than three thousand portraits, bound in 19 vols., was £38 10s. It had cost the former owner nearly £200.

The following collections have been published in illustration of Granger&#x27;s work: (a) ‘Portraits illustrating Granger&#x27;s Biographical History of England’ (known under the name of ‘Richardson&#x27;s Collection’), 6 pts. Lond. 1792–1812; (b) Samuel Woodburn&#x27;s &#x27;Gallery of [over two hundred] Portraits … illustrative of Granger&#x27;s Biographical History of England, &amp;c.,&#x27; Lond. 1816; (c) &#x27;A Collection of Portraits to illustrate Granger&#x27;s Biographical History of England and Noble&#x27;s continuation to Granger, forming a Supplement to Richardson&#x27;s Copies of rare Granger Portraits,&#x27; 2 vols. Lond. 1820–2.

==Extra-illustration==
Extra-illustration, the process by which drawings, prints and other visual materials were interleaved with a printed text – often the history of a town, county or notable individual – is frequently called &quot;Grangerising&quot; or &quot;Grangerisation.&quot; These terms, however, only came into use from the 1880s, more than a century after Granger&#x27;s death. Ironically for the process of book customisation that carries his name, Granger never &quot;grangerized&quot; a book. There are many examples of extra-illustration, especially Granger&#x27;s &quot;Biographical History&quot;. The most important and first extra-illustrated Granger was prepared by Richard Bull. Now in the Huntington Library, California, it contains over 14,000 prints across 36 volumes. Another was prepared by the Bristol antiquarian George Weare Braikenridge, who &quot;grangerized&quot; his copy of the &quot;Biographical History&quot; with nearly 4,000 portraits. His main interest, however, was in extra-illustrating his copy of William Barrett&#x27;s &quot;History and Antiquities of the City of Bristol&quot;.

==Animal rights==

In 1772, Granger preached a sermon against cruelty to animals. However, during the 18th century the subject of humane treatment to animals was deemed beneath the Church and was considered abuse of the pulpit. The sermon caused an &quot;almost universal disgust to two considerable congregations&quot;, as mention of dogs and horses was regarded as a &quot;prostitution of the dignity of the pulpit&quot;. Granger went to prison for preaching twice against cruelty to animals.

The sermon was published as &quot;An Apology for the Brute Creation&quot; (1772). In his day, the sermon was unpopular and only one hundred copies had been sold by January, 1773. However, it was positively reviewed in the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; and the &quot;Critical Review&quot; as a sensible discourse. The sermon influenced Arthur Broome, one of the founders of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

==Works==

His works are: 
*&quot;Biographical History of England, from Egbert the Great to the Revolution, consisting of Characters dispersed in different Classes, and adapted to a Methodical Catalogue of Engraved British Heads. Intended as an Essay towards reducing our Biography to System, and a help to the knowledge of Portraits; with a variety of Anecdotes and Memoirs of a great number of persons not to be found in any other Biographical Work. With a preface, showing the utility of a collection of Engraved Portraits to supply the defect, and answer the various purposes of Medals&quot;, 2 vols. Lond. 1769, and a supplement consisting of corrections and large additions, 1774; 2nd edit. 4 vols. 1775; 3rd edit. 4 vols. 1779; 4th edit. 4 vols. 1804; 5th edit., with upwards of four hundred additional lives, 6 vols. 1824. A continuation of the work from the revolution of 1688 to the end of the reign of George I appeared in 3 vols. Lond. 1806, from manuscripts left by Granger and the collections of the editor, Mark Noble. 
*&quot;An Apology for the Brute Creation, or Abuse of Animals censured&quot;, 1772. This sermon was preached in his church on 18 October 1772, and, as a postscript states, gave almost universal disgust to his parishioners, as &quot;the mention of horses and dogs was censured as a prostitution of the dignity of the pulpit, and considered as a proof of the author&#x27;s growing insanity&quot;.
*&quot;The Nature and Extent of Industry&quot;, a sermon preached before the Archbishop of Canterbury in the parish church of Shiplake on 4 July 1775. This was dedicated: &quot;To the inhabitants of the parish of Shiplake who neglect the service of the church, and spend the Sabbath in the worst kind of idleness, this plain sermon, which they never heard, and probably will never read, is inscribed by their sincere well-wisher and faithful minister, J. G.&quot; This and the previous discourse were well received by the public.
*&quot;Letters between the Rev. James Granger, M.A. [sic], and many of the most eminent Literary Men of his time: composing a copious history and illustration of the Biographical History of England. With Miscellanies and Notes of Tours in France, Holland, and Spain, by the same Gentleman&quot;, London, 1805, edited by James Peller Malcolm, author of &quot;Londinium Redivivum&quot;.

<text>Aliivibrio fischeri (formerly &quot;Vibrio fischeri&quot;) is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium found globally in marine environments. This bacterium grows most effectively in water with a salt concentration at around 20g/L, and at temperatures between 24 and 28°C. This species is non-pathogenic and has bioluminescent properties. It is found predominantly in symbiosis with various marine animals, such as the Hawaiian bobtail squid. It is heterotrophic, oxidase-positive, and motile by means of a tuft of polar flagella. Free-living &quot;A. fischeri&quot; cells survive on decaying organic matter. The bacterium is a key research organism for examination of microbial bioluminescence, quorum sensing, and bacterial-animal symbiosis. It is named after Bernhard Fischer, a German microbiologist.

&quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot; is the family &quot;Vibrionaceae.&quot; This family of bacteria tend to have adaptable metabolisms that can adjust to diverse circumstances. This flexibility may contribute to &quot;A. fischeri&#x27;s&quot; ability to survive both alone and in symbiotic relationships.

Ribosomal RNA comparison led to the reclassification of this species from genus &quot;Vibrio&quot; to the newly created &quot;Aliivibrio&quot; in 2007. The change is recognized as a valid publication, and according to the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN), the correct name. However, the name change is has not been universally adopted by most researchers, who still publish using the name &quot;Vibrio fischeri&quot;.

==Genome==
The genome of &quot;A. fischeri&quot; was completely sequenced in 2004 and consists of two chromosomes, one smaller and one larger. Chromosome 1 has 2.9 million base pairs (Mbp) and chromosome 2 has 1.5 Mbp, bringing the total genome to 4.4 Mbp.

&quot;A. fischeri&quot; has the lowest G+C content of 27 &quot;Vibrio&quot; species but is still related to higher-pathogenicity species such as &quot;V. cholerae.&quot; The genome for &quot;A. fischeri&quot; also carries mobile genetic elements. The precise functions of these elements in &quot;A. fischeri&quot; are not fully understood. However, they are known to acquire new genes that are associated with virulence and resistance to environmental stresses in other bacterial genomes.

Some strains of &quot;A. fischeri,&quot; such as strain ES114, contain a plasmid. The plasmid in strain ES114 is called pES100 and is most likely used for conjugation purposes. This purpose was determined based on the 45.8 kbp gene sequence, most of which codes for a type IV section system. The ability to preform conjugation can be helpful for both beneficial and pathogenic strains, as it allows for DNA exchange. 

There is evidence that the genome of &quot;A. fischeri&quot; includes pilus gene clusters. These clusters encode for many different kinds of pili, which serve a variety of functions. In this species, there are pili used for pathogenesis, twitching motility, tight adhesion, and toxin-coregulation, and more.

==Ecology==

&quot;A. fischeri&quot; are globally distributed in temperate and subtropical marine environments. They can be found free-floating in oceans, as well as associated with marine animals, sediment, and decaying matter. &quot;A. fischeri&quot; have been most studied as symbionts of marine animals, including squids in the genus &quot;Euprymna&quot; and &quot;Sepiola&quot;, where &quot;A. fischeri&quot; can be found in the squids&#x27; light organs. This relationship has been best characterized in the Hawaiian bobtail squid (&quot;Euprymna scolopes&quot;). &quot;A. fischeri&quot; is the only species of bacteria inhabiting the squid&#x27;s light organ, despite an environment full of other bacteria.

=== Symbiosis with the Hawaiian bobtail squid ===
&quot;A. fischeri&quot; colonization of the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtail squid (&quot;Euprymna scolopes&quot;&quot;)&quot; is currently studied as a simple model for mutualistic symbiosis, as it contains only two species and &quot;A. fischeri&quot; can be cultured in a lab and genetically modified. &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot; utilizes chitin as a primary carbon and nitrogen source in its symbiosis with the Hawaiian bobtail squid. In the squid’s light organ, &quot;A. fischeri&quot; breaks down chitin into N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which acts as both a nutrient and a chemoattractant, guiding colonization. Chitinases facilitate this breakdown, while the regulatory protein NagC controls gene expression for chitin and GlcNAc use. The bacteria metabolize GlcNAc through fermentation or respiration, supporting energy needs and bioluminescence, which are crucial for the mutualistic relationship with the squid. This mutualistic symbiosis provides &quot;A. fischeri&quot; with nutrients and a protected environment and helps the squid avoid predation using bioluminescence. 

&quot;A. fischeri&quot; provides luminescence by colonizing the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, which is on its ventral side. The organ luminesces at night, providing the squid with counter-illumination camouflage. The light organs of some squid contain reflective plates that intensify and direct the light produced, due to proteins known as reflectins. They regulate the light intensity to match that of the sea surface below. This strategy prevents the squid from casting a shadow on the ocean floor, helping it avoid predation during feeding. The &quot;A. fischeri&quot; population is maintained by daily cycles. About 90% of &quot;A. fischeri&quot; are ejected by the squid every morning in a process known as &quot;venting&quot;. The 10% of bacteria remaining in the squid replenish the bacterial population before the following night.

&quot;A. fischeri&quot; are horizontally acquired by young squids from their environment. Venting is thought to provide the source from which newly hatched squid are colonized. This colonization induces developmental and morphological changes in the squid&#x27;s light organ, which is translucent. Morphological changes made by &quot;A. fischeri&quot; do not occur when the microbe cannot luminesce, such as a decrease in the number of pores in the light organ. Additionally, if colonization by &quot;A. fischeri&quot; is abruptly removed by antibiotics, the ciliated epithelium of the light organ will regress. These changes show that bioluminescence is truly essential for symbiosis. 

In the process of colonization, ciliated cells within the animals&#x27; photophores (light-producing organs) selectively draw in the symbiotic bacteria. These cells create microcurrents that, when combined with mucus, promote the growth of the symbionts and actively reject any competitors. The bacteria cause the ciliated cells to die once the light organ is sufficiently colonized.

==Bioluminescence==
The bioluminescence of &quot;A. fischeri&quot; is caused by transcription of the &quot;lux&quot; operon, and the following translation of the lux proteins, which produce the light. This process is induced through population-dependent quorum sensing. The population of &quot;A. fischeri&quot; needs to reach an optimal level to activate the &quot;lux&quot; operon and stimulate light production. The circadian rhythm controls light expression, where luminescence is much brighter during the day and dimmer at night, as required for camouflage.

The bacterial luciferin-luciferase system is encoded by a set of genes labelled the &quot;lux&quot; operon. In &quot;A. fischeri&quot;, five such genes (&quot;luxCDABEG&quot;) have been identified as active in the emission of visible light, and two genes (&quot;luxR&quot; and &quot;luxI&quot;) are involved in regulating the operon. Several external and intrinsic factors appear to either induce or inhibit the transcription of this gene set and produce or suppress light emission.

&quot;A. fischeri&quot; is one of many species of bacteria that commonly form symbiotic relationships with marine organisms. Marine organisms contain bacteria that use bioluminescence so they can find mates, ward off predators, attract prey, or communicate with other organisms. In return, the organism the bacteria are living within provides the bacteria with a nutrient-rich environment. The &quot;lux&quot; operon is a 9-kilobase fragment of the &quot;A. fischeri&quot; genome that controls bioluminescence through the catalytic activity of the enzyme luciferase. This operon has a known gene sequence of &quot;luxCDAB(F)E&quot;, where &quot;luxA&quot; and &quot;luxB&quot; code for the protein subunits of the luciferase enzyme, and the &quot;luxCDE&quot; codes for a fatty acid reductase complex that makes the fatty acids necessary for the luciferase mechanism.&quot; luxC &quot;codes for the enzyme acyl-reductase, &quot;luxD&quot; codes for acyl-transferase, and &quot;luxE&quot; makes the proteins needed for the enzyme acyl-protein synthetase. Luciferase produces blue/green light through the oxidation of reduced flavin mononucleotide and a long-chain aldehyde by diatomic oxygen. The reaction is summarized as:

:FMNH2 + O2 + R-CHO → FMN + R-COOH + H2O + light.

The reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH) is provided by the &quot;fre&quot; gene, also referred to as &quot;luxG&quot;. In &quot;A. fischeri&quot;, it is directly next to &quot;luxE&quot; (giving &quot;luxCDABE-fre&quot;) from 1042306 to 1048745.

To generate the aldehyde needed in the reaction above, three additional enzymes are needed. The fatty acids needed for the reaction are pulled from the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway by acyl-transferase. Acyl-transferase reacts with acyl-ACP to release R-COOH, a free fatty acid. R-COOH is reduced by a two-enzyme system to an aldehyde. The reaction is:

:R-COOH + ATP + NADPH → R-CHO + AMP + PP + NADP+.

== Quorum sensing ==
One primary system that controls bioluminescence through regulation of the &quot;lux&quot; operon is quorum sensing, a conserved mechanism across many microbial species that regulates gene expression in response to bacterial concentration. Quorum sensing functions through the production of an autoinducer, usually a small organic molecule, by individual cells. As cell populations increase, levels of autoinducers increase, and specific proteins that regulate transcription of genes bind to these autoinducers, altering gene expression. This system allows microbial cells to &quot;communicate&quot; amongst each other and coordinate behaviors, such as luminescence, which require large amounts of cells to produce a noticeable effect.

In &quot;A. fischeri&quot;, there are two primary quorum sensing systems, each of which responds to slightly different environments. The first system is commonly referred to as the &quot;lux&quot; system, as it is encoded within the &quot;lux&quot; operon, and uses the autoinducer 3OC6-HSL. The protein LuxI synthesizes this signal, which is subsequently released from the cell. This signal, 3OC6-HSL, then binds to the protein LuxR, which regulates the expression of many different genes, but most notably upregulation of genes involved in luminescence. The second system, commonly referred to as the &quot;ain&quot; system, uses the autoinducer C8-HSL, which is produced by the protein AinS. Similar to the &quot;lux&quot; system, the autoinducer C8-HSL increases activation of LuxR. In addition, C8-HSL binds to another transcriptional regulator, LitR, giving the &quot;ain&quot; and &quot;lux&quot; systems of quorum sensing slightly different genetic targets within the cell.

The different genetic targets of the &quot;ain&quot; and &quot;lux&quot; systems are essential, because these two systems respond to different cellular environments. The &quot;ain&quot; system regulates transcription in response to intermediate cell density cell environments, producing lower levels of luminescence and even regulating metabolic processes such as the acetate switch. In contrast, the &quot;lux&quot; quorum sensing system occurs in response to high cell densities, producing high levels of luminescence and regulating the transcription of additional genes, including QsrP, RibB, and AcfA. Both of the &quot;ain&quot; and &quot;lux&quot; quorum sensing systems are essential for colonization of the squid and regulate multiple colonization factors in the bacteria.
== Research applications ==

&quot;A. fischeri&quot; has broad applications in ecotoxicology and environmental research. Its bioluminescence is observed in oxygen-rich environments and thus is sensitive to toxicants. Reductions in light emissions are used in bioassays such as the Microtox test to assess water quality. It plays a key role in studying the effects of chemical mixtures, helping identify synergistic or antagonistic toxic interactions. In biotechnology, its light-producing mechanism is harnessed for developing biosensors that detect environmental pollutants in real time, making it a valuable tool in pollution monitoring and water treatment studies. Bioluminescence inhibition assays of &quot;A. fischeri&quot; can be used to measure for organic solvents, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH&#x27;s), pesticides, and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH&#x27;s). The bacteria’s adaptation to competitive marine environments, where they may produce unique bioactive compounds, may also position them as useful organisms for discovering novel antibiotics from marine sources. 

== Natural transformation ==
Natural bacterial transformation is an adaptation for transferring DNA from one individual cell to another. Natural transformation, including the uptake and incorporation of exogenous DNA into the recipient genome, has been demonstrated in &quot;A. fischeri&quot;. This process is induced by chitohexaose and is likely regulated by genes &quot;tfoX&quot; and &quot;tfoY&quot;. Natural transformation of &quot;A. fischeri&quot; facilitates rapid transfer of mutant genes across strains and provides a valuable tool for experimental genetic manipulation in this species.

==State microbe status==
In 2014, Hawaiian State Senator Glenn Wakai submitted SB3124, proposing &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot; as the state microbe of Hawaii. The bill competed with a bill advocating for &quot;Flavobacterium akiainvivens&quot; to receive the same designation; ultimately, neither bill passed. In 2017, similar legislation similar to the original 2013 &quot;F. akiainvivens&quot; bill was submitted in the Hawaii House of Representatives by Isaac Choy and in the Hawaii Senate by Brian Taniguchi, but &quot;A. fischeri&quot; did not appear in this or any later proposals.

<text>Anne Grant often styled Mrs Anne Grant of Laggan (21 February 1755 – 7 November 1838) was a Scottish poet and author best known for her collection of mostly biographical poems &quot;Memoirs of an American Lady&quot; as well as her earlier work &quot;Letters from the Mountains&quot;.

She personally exemplified the Scottish Highlands attributes which she admired: &quot;virtuous and dignified poverty, elegance of sentiment that lives in the heart and conduct, and subsists independent of local and transitory modes.&quot; In worldly wisdom, in literature, and in piety, her early attainments were admirable, and they were in later life well sustained, if not augmented. Her reading seems to have been extensive, but desultory. For doing this, she had singular advantages in her personal intercourse with the Edinburgh and &quot;Quarterly Reviewers&quot;, and in her constant habit of retailing her own opinions and their judgments in frequent conversations with other associates, and in numerous letters to her friends, so that the same subject, being set before her mind in several different lights of investigation in receiving, and of explanation in imparting it, became perfectly familiar, and took its durable place in her retentive memory. 

==Early years and education==
===Scotland===
Anne Macvicar, was born at Glasgow, on 2 February 1755. She was the only child of Duncan Macvicar, a Highland resident, who married in the year 1753 a Stewart of Invernahyle. Grant lived in the mountain home of her maternal ancestors until she was eighteen months old. In the year 1757, Duncan Macvicar, having obtained a commission in the 77th Regiment of Foot, went to North America, leaving his wife and daughter at Glasgow.

===New York===
Mrs. Macvicar some time afterwards received his directions to follow him; and accompanied by their daughter, she landed at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1758, and took up her temporary residence at Albany, New York. Mr. Macvicar, having exchanged into the 55th Regiment, was sent down from headquarters at Oswego, New York on Lake Ontario to buy stores, with leave of absence to visit his family. On his return, he took his wife and child with him to the garrison, travelling in a boat up the river. He served in the attack on Ticonderoga, 8 July 1758, when seven of his fellow officers were killed. On the declaration of peace between Great Britain and France in 1762, the 55th Regiment was ordered to New York, previous to embarkation for England.

Returning by the river from Oswego to Albany, the Macvicars became intimate with Madame Margarita Schuyler (1701–1782), who had then left her mansion on The Flats, and purchased a house in that town.. Mr. Macvicar, retiring on half-pay from the army in 1765, received a grant of land from the government, and purchased from two fellow officers their land grants. These lands, lying adjacent, after being cleared, seemed to Mr. Macvicar to be ideal for a fertile and profitable estate. Mr. Macvicar hired men to survey and map his lands, and also at the time reasonably expected that his [sic] Township of Clarendon would in a few years become a very valuable property. Meanwhile, Mr. Macvicar became the tenant of Madame Schuyler’s new house at The Flats, in the township of Claverac, and of a few adjacent acres of land.

At this period of her life, Grant had two homes, usually spending the summer with her parents, presumably at Invernahyle in Scotland, and the winter with Madame Schuyler at Albany. She had lived among Dutch settlers, French Huguenots, English soldiers, African-American slaves, and Mohawk people. She had learned the Dutch language among her young friends at Albany, and had frequented the summer wigwams of the indigenous peoples. She could talk their language sufficiently well to make herself understood by those women and children who were accustomed to European conversations. All this knowledge, Grant had amassed by the time that she was ten years of age.

Her acquaintance with books at that period was proportionately small. Soon after her arrival in America, she had been taught needlework and the elements of reading by her mother, and a soldier had given her lessons in pot-hooks, hangers, and joining-hand. The family Bible, and a Scotch sergeant&#x27;s copy of Blind Harry&#x27;s &quot;The Wallace&quot; were the earliest books to which she had access, and she derived from studying the latter on the banks of Lake Ontario an enthusiastic feeling for Scotland, which lasted through life.

On the voyage back to Albany, from the garrison at Oswego, staying a while at Fort Brewerton, Captain Mungo Campbell, the commander, presented her with an illustrated copy of the &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. This, with the aid of a tattered copy of Nathan Bailey&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;, she learned at last to understand. It served her in the first instance as a vocabulary, then as a story book, and subsequently as an incentive to poetical aspirations. At Madame Schuyler’s, Grant became acquainted with Shakespeare, Alexander Pope, Addison, and a few other standard authors. She also took lessons in geography and the use of the globes from the Dutch chaplain. Her principal advantage, however, consisted in oral instructions received from Madame Schuyler, and from listening to the conversations held by her monitress with the military officers

===Return to Scotland===
Disgusted with the new settlers, and suffering from rheumatism, Mr. Macvicar suddenly resolved on returning with his wife and daughter to Scotland. His neighbour, Captain John Munro, consented to take charge of the &quot;Township of Clarendon&quot;, and with a reasonable expectation of deriving an income from it in a few years, and of securing an ample inheritance for his child, he reappeared in Glasgow in 1768. Shortly after their departure, the American Revolution began, and they never returned, their land being seized by the colonials.

In Glasgow, Grant found several girls of her own age, including two sisters named Pagan, afterwards better known as Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Brown, with whom, during the three following years, she cultivated a friendship. The change of scene and of circumstances provided progress for her education. Her father had again employed himself in commerce, but he resigned that occupation and accepted the appointment of barrack-master at Fort Augustus, in the county of Inverness, in 1773, and immediately removed there with his family.

==Career==
===Fort Augustus===
In Fort Augustus, for six years, Grant lived among the families of the military officers, and the inhabitants of the Strathmore, while practising literary composition in writing letters to her Lowland and other friends, and in occasional sallies of poetry.

The chaplain of Fort Augustus was a young clergyman named James Grant, who, in the year 1776, was presented to the neighbouring living of Laggan. He had no fortune, but was a gentleman by birth, and connected with the families in the county. Anne and James married in May 1779. Her parents, soon after this event, removed to Fort George, Highland, where Mr. Macvicar was appointed barrack-master.

===Laggan===

The Grants lived in Laggan for the next twenty-two years. Their cottage was from Perth, and the same distance from Inverness, and these were the nearest towns. They rented a small farm from the Duke of Gordon as an additional source of income. Soon after her marriage, Grant received into her family Charlotte Grant, a young girl who was her husband’s relative.

Almost every year, Grant took a few weeks&#x27; holiday to visit her family and acquaintances in different parts of the Strathmore, including her parents, and her favourite friends at Glasgow. She acquainted herself with the Gaelic language, and was able not only to speak it with the people, and to understand the religious services which her husband performed in it, but to translate the compositions both of ancient and modern bards. Her travels through the Highlands of Scotland during this time would come to greatly impact her future literary work, which draws heavily on the imagery of the region.

The first great trouble she ever felt was the death of her second son, age four. A year or two afterwards, she also lost twin daughters. Her elder children, usually two or three at a time, generally resided with her parents, who, in 1794, left Fort George, and took a house in the city of Glasgow. There the grandchildren enjoyed many educational advantages. On the death of a favourite companion of her girlhood, Grant took one of the small children into her own home. When Charlotte Grant, who had lived with her since early in her marriage, married early but also died young, Grant took in her child.

When the family estate was absorbed into the new State of Vermont, Grant&#x27;s financial expectations were severely altered; yet the loss affected her only slightly. The death of her eldest son, John-Lauchlan, at the age of fifteen, was dreadful to her. Its effect was somewhat softened to both parents by the birth of a fourth son a fortnight afterwards, and for eighteen months, although depressed in health and spirits, their domestic happiness was so perfect that Grant subsequently declared that, if she were permitted to select six months out of her whole former life to live over again, she would choose the last six of that period. However, it came to a fearful close: Rev. Grant was attacked by inflammation of the chest, and after three days&#x27; illness, he died in 1801. They had been married twenty-two years and of their twelve children, eight survived, six daughters and two sons. 

===Woodend near Stirling===
In June 1803, she reluctantly left Laggan with her children, and took up residence at Woodend near Stirling, having garden-ground attached to her dwelling and a few acres of pasture-land. Her father died in the same year at Glasgow, and her mother, who had a small pension as an officer’s widow, came to spend the remainder of her life living with her daughter. Grant&#x27;s only certain income was the small pension due to her as the widow of a military chaplain. The Duke of Gordon considerately permitted her to remain the tenant of his farm for two years after her husband’s death. She was also aided by the kindness of many among her family connections and friends. They collected the original verses and translations which she had previously written and given away, sent them to her for revision, and published them under the patronage of the Duchess of Gordon, three thousand names appearing in the list of subscribers.

Twice within the years 1803, 1804, and 1805, maternal duties summoned Grant to various parts of England, the last of these visits being to London and its vicinity for the purpose of fitting out her third and eldest surviving son, Duncan James, for India, the Right Honourable Charles Grant having obtained a cadetship for his young clansman. To make a comfortable provision for all her children had now become her chief desire, and to further this object she resolved, at the suggestion of her friends, Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Brown, and others, with whom she had kept up a correspondence from her girlhood, to publish the letters which they had preserved. Early in the year 1806, under the title of &quot;Letters from the Mountains&quot;, those letters were published by Messrs. Longman, and met with extraordinary success. She derived from this work, not only large financial profits, but also many invaluable friendships.

While residing at Woodend she took charge of several little boys as boarders, and among them, at one time was young Morritt of Rokeby. Sir Henry and Lady Steuart were her nearest neighbours. In April 1807, her daughter Charlotte died at the age of seventeen. In July of the same year, her daughter Catherine died, age twenty-five. Grief for these children was mingled with fearful apprehension for the six survivors, as their cases made her fully aware that the insidious illness of their father’s family, consumption, was inherited by their children.

Having kept alive her American remembrances by comparing them with those of her mother, and having enlarged and corrected these conjoint impressions by reading Cadwallader Colden&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Five Indian Nations&quot;, and that part of the &quot;Travels through the United States of North America&quot; by François Alexandre Frédéric, duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt which relates his tour from Upper Canada to New York, she fortunately met in London with several near relations of Madame Schuyler, who afforded her the aid of their more accurate knowledge, while she was engaged in finishing the manuscript and correcting the proof-sheets of her &quot;Memoirs of an American Lady&quot;, which appeared in 1808. It was her largest success and met with a very favourable reception. It provided a description of growing up in pre-revolutionary America and her life with the Schuyler family in Albany who helped raise and educate her. The book also came to inspire other writers and artists interested in the Scottish Highlands, and it often cited as the inspiration for the Scottish folk song &quot;Blue Bells of Scotland&quot;.

It is not to be doubted, although the observation does not seem to have been uttered or to have got into print, that the &quot;Letters from the Mountains&quot; were partly indebted for their immediate success to their connection with the birthplace of James Macpherson and the race of Ossian. The &quot;Memoirs of an American Lady&quot;, also, fell into and harmonised with the recollections of many survivors of the American war, and thus in the first instance, gained favor with the public. Without such introductory circumstances, both works might have failed to excite attention, but, having gained it, their intrinsic merits sufficed to extend and heighten their celebrity. They passed through repeated editions, and were the means of constantly enlarging the circle of her personal friends.

===Edinburgh===
In 1809, the Countess of Glasgow having requested her to take charge of her ladyship’s daughter, who was then leaving school, Grant was induced to wish for other pupils of a similar kind, whom her daughters might instruct under her own supervision. With this object in view, she took some steps towards removing to London, but she eventually decided on fixing her residence in Edinburgh, where she took a house in Heriot Row, and removed her family there in March 1810.

In 1811, she published her &quot;Essays on the Superstition of the Highlands of Scotland, with Translations from the Gaelic&quot;. Towards the close of the same year, her mother, Mrs. Macvicar, died, age 84. The two following years were chiefly spent in training the pupils committed to her care. One of her final large pieces of work was &quot;Eighteen Hundred and Thirteen&quot;, was published in 1814. It was a lengthy poem about the prospects of a prosperous century for Great Britain. On 14 August of that year, her son, Lieutenant Duncan-James Grant, died at Surat, while engaged in military duty. A few days later, Grant&#x27;s daughter Anne died.

==Later years==
Grant did not publish much after 1814, but stayed involved in the literary community and wrote a great deal of correspondence. In the spring of 1815, finding that her house in Heriot Row had become too small for her pupils, Grant removed to a larger one in Prince’s Street. In September 1820, she accidentally slipped down some stone steps, and received an injury which lamed her for life, but did not abate her general health. In 1821, the Highland Society of London awarded her their gold medal for the best &quot;Essay on the Past and Present State of the Highlands of Scotland&quot;. On 1 July in the same year, Grant’s youngest daughter, Moore, died at age twenty-five. On 16 June 1823, her daughter Isabella died.

Her standing allowed Grant the rare luxury of being granted a pension from the Civil List in 1825. In 1826, Grant removed her residence to Braehouse, a detached dwelling surrounded by a garden, which better suited her reduced mobility. On 16 November 1827, Mary, her eldest and last surviving daughter, died. Of all her twelve children, only one remained, the youngest son. Her pupils, who loved her so well that they seldom left her home until called upon to establish households of their own, gathered often around her, and habitually showed her the most dutiful attentions. Her books, her school, legacies from deceased friends, and at last a literary pension, placed her late in life in easy circumstances.

==Death and legacy==

In April 1832, on her son’s marriage, she left Braehouse to reside with him. Early in the year 1837, her daughter-in-law died, and she removed to Manor Place. She continued to associate and to correspond with her friends until a few weeks before her death, which occurred on 7 November 1838. She was buried near the graves of four of her daughters in the New Cemetery of St Cuthbert&#x27;s churchyard in Edinburgh. The grave lies on the outer wall of the southern section, near the south-east corner.

In the year 1844, her &quot;Autobiography, and a Series of &#x27;Familiar Letters&#x27; from 1803 to 1838&quot;, were published, edited by her son John-Peter Grant, writer to the &quot;Signet&quot;. A number of Grant&#x27;s manuscripts are preserved in the David Laing collection in the Edinburgh University Library.

==Style==
There was a want of systematic accuracy in all her compositions. She had little constructive power, and great ability in word-painting from natural objects. Her style failed in precision, though it was seldom deficient in perspicuity. Her syntax was often faulty; her orthography was notoriously incorrect, and wholly at the mercy of the printers. She used many peculiarities of diction, often substituting the preposition &quot;of&quot; for the preposition &quot;for,&quot; and making the adverb &quot;whenever&quot; equivalent to &quot;as soon as:&quot; for instance, &quot;I am the better of being tenderly cared for, and of three months in the country&quot;-—&quot;Whenever she heard that I was here, she came.&quot; Like most Scotch writers of the time, she sometimes misplaced the verbs &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall.&quot;

Every moral and social truth which she knew, and her memory was full of such, had been either directly brought to her by a fact, impressed by a fact, or conjoined with one by way of illustration. All these facts were either incidents of her personal history, or occurrences in the lives of people upon whose traces she had trodden. This realisation of things imparted to her writings an air of freshness and originality, which, atoning for all faults of construction and of style, rendered their perusal in a pleasing manner. It had the same effect in society, where the sagacity of her intellect, the warmth of her heart, her natural ease and fluency of speech, and the refined simplicity of her manners, rendered her an object of interest, and often of admiration.

She was undoubtedly gifted with that faculty of originating ideas which constitutes genius. She versified harmoniously, and rhymed with facility. She had a frank avowal of her sensations and feelings. With admirable impartiality and candour, but with too much severity, Grant asserted that she had &quot;no fountain of inspiration, but a cistern of acquisitions&quot;.

==Themes==
In a letter to Catherine Maria Fanshawe, dated 18 February 1809, Grant said:—

Again, writing to the same friend, on 17 September 1810, Grant said, in reference to a tour which she had lately made with some English visitors :—

Here is confession, unwittingly made, that the true spirit of sublime poetry never inhabited the mind of Grant. Historic, traditional, and poetical associations can light up their localities with brightness all their own. Heroes and heroines appear to advantage with a background of solemn or beautiful scenery, and the secondary charm of human interest is added by fictitious narrative to many an alpine spot. That charm, however, can invest any landscape, whether mountainous or marine, of the woodland or the plain: Cowper has difl&#x27;used it over the flat arable and pasture lands of Buckinghamshire; the Brontés have cast its lustre with fascinating brilliancy across the bleak and unpicturesque moors of Haworth. Genuine appreciation of natural scenery has its proper gradations of admiration and love for every landscape, but it is in all its varied characters essentially different and distinct from mere adventitious associations. Grant became reconciled to mountain heights, glens, and cataracts, for the sake of those who had trodden and sung there; or under the spell of romantic fiction. She learned to like the severe and stately glory of desert ranges; but it was after the same manner that some persons take pleasure in sea-views, on account of the graceful ships and pretty boats which diversify the monotonous vastness of the ocean.

==Discrepancies==
Having lived among the most eminent literary people of the time, and read all the fashionable books, Grant has thrown into her letters anecdotes, sketches of character, and critical remarks, which add to the interest they possess as records of family biography. Between her fragmentary &quot;Autobiography&quot; and the statements made in her &quot;Letters&quot; posthumously published, compared with her &quot;Letters from the Mountains&quot;, and her &quot;Memoirs of an American Lady&quot;, many flagrant discrepancies occur. Guided by the rule of always adopting contemporaneous documents in preference to long unwritten reminiscences, while accepting also such subsequent documents as cast a broader light upon preceding ones, this biographical notice has been founded upon the best evidence afforded by her writings.

Her memory was wonderfully good, but she trusted it too implicitly upon other points as well as upon those of her family and personal history. The &quot;Letters from the Mountains&quot;, and the &quot;Memoirs of an American Lady&quot;, give totally different accounts of Aunt Schuyler’s birth and parentage. Several passages in the &quot;Memoirs&quot; are likewise opposed to each other. At page 141 of the &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Grant states that the old Colonel did not live to witness his eldest son’s marriage with Catalina, which took place in the year 1719. At page 163 of the same volume, she states that this young pair chiefly resided with the old Colonel for two years before his death, which took place in 1721. These inconsistencies, so far as they relate to the Schuylers, may possibly have been rectified in after editions, but strange want of vigilance is manifested by the omission of at least a note to show the reader that the second statement was to be considered as a correction of the first.

<text>The 1993 Storm of the Century (also known as the 93 Superstorm, The No Name Storm, or the Great Blizzard of &#x27;93/1993) was a devastating cyclonic storm, or nor&#x27;easter, that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on March 12, 1993. The cold weather, heavy snowfall, high winds and storm surge that the storm brought affected a very large area; at its height, it stretched from Canada to Honduras. The cyclone moved through the Gulf of Mexico and then through the eastern United States before moving on to eastern Canada. It eventually dissipated in the North Atlantic Ocean on March 15.

Heavy snow was first reported in highland areas as far south as Alabama and northern Georgia, with Union County, Georgia reporting up to of snow. Birmingham, Alabama, reported a rare of snow. The Florida Panhandle reported around of snow, with hurricane-force wind gusts and record low barometric pressures. Between Louisiana and Cuba, the hurricane-force winds produced high storm surges across the Big Bend of Florida which, in combination with scattered tornadoes, killed dozens of people.

Record cold temperatures were seen across portions of the Southern United States and Eastern United States in the wake of this storm. In the United States, the storm was responsible for the loss of electric power to more than 10 million households. An estimated 40 percent of the country&#x27;s population experienced the effects of the storm and it led to a total of 208 fatalities. In all, the storm resulted in 318 deaths, and caused $5.5 billion (1993 USD) in damages.

The greatest recorded snowfall amounts were at Mount Le Conte in Tennessee, where of snow fell, and Mount Mitchell in North Carolina, the tallest mountain in eastern North America, where was measured to fall and snow drifts were reported.

==Meteorological history==

A volcanic winter is thought to have started with the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The temperature in the stratosphere rose to several degrees higher than normal, due to the absorption of radiation by the aerosol. The stratospheric cloud from the eruption persisted in the atmosphere for three years. The eruption, while not directly responsible, may have played a part in the formation of the 1993 Storm of the Century.

During March 11 and 12, 1993, temperatures over much of the eastern United States began to drop as an arctic high pressure system built over the Midwestern United States and the Great Plains. Concurrently, an extratropical area of low pressure formed over Mexico along a stationary front draped west to east. By the afternoon of March 12, a defined airmass boundary was present along the deepening low. An initial burst of convective precipitation off the southern coast of Texas (facilitated by the transport of tropical moisture into the region) enabled initial intensification of the surface feature on March 12. Supported by a strong split-polar jet stream and a shortwave trough, the nascent system rapidly deepened. The system&#x27;s central pressure fell to by 00:00 UTC on March 13. A powerful low-level jet over eastern Cuba and the Gulf of Mexico enhanced a cold front extending from the low southward to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Furthermore, the subtropical jet stream was displaced unusually far south, reaching into the Pacific Ocean near Central America and extending toward Honduras and Jamaica. Intense ageostrophic flow was noted over the southern United States, with winds flowing perpendicular to isobars over Louisiana.

As the area of low pressure moved through the central Gulf of Mexico, a short wave trough in the northern branch of the jet stream fused with the system in the southern stream, which further strengthened the surface low. A squall line developed along the system&#x27;s cold front, which moved rapidly across the eastern Gulf of Mexico through Florida and Cuba. The cyclone&#x27;s center moved into north-west Florida early on the morning of March 13, with a significant storm surge in the northwestern Florida peninsula that drowned several people. This initially caused the storm to be a blizzard but also cyclonic.

Barometric pressures recorded during the storm were low. Readings of were recorded in Tallahassee, Florida, and even lower readings of were observed in New England. Low pressure records for March were set in areas of twelve states along the Eastern Seaboard, with all-time low pressure records set between Tallahassee and Washington, D.C. Snow began to spread over the eastern United States, and a large squall line moved from the Gulf of Mexico into Florida and Cuba. The storm system tracked up the East Coast during Saturday and into Canada by early Monday morning. In the storm&#x27;s wake, unseasonably cold temperatures were recorded over the next two days in the Southeast.

===Forecasting===
Storm of the Century marked a milestone in the weather forecasting of the United States. By March 8, 1993, several operational numerical weather prediction models and medium-range forecasters at the United States National Weather Service recognized the threat of a significant snowstorm. This marked the first time National Weather Service meteorologists were able to predict accurately a system&#x27;s severity five days in advance. Official blizzard warnings were issued two days before the storm arrived, as shorter-range models began to confirm the predictions. Forecasters were finally confident enough of the computer-forecast models to support decisions by several northeastern states to declare a state of emergency even before the snow started to fall.

==Impact==

The storm complex was large and widespread, affecting at least 26 US states and much of eastern Canada. It brought in cold air along with heavy precipitation and hurricane-force winds which, ultimately, caused a blizzard over the affected area; this also included thundersnow from Georgia to Pennsylvania and widespread whiteout conditions. Snow flurries were seen in the air as far south as Jacksonville, Florida, and some areas of central Florida received a trace of snow. The storm severely impacted both ground and air travel. Airports were closed all along the eastern seaboard, and flights were cancelled or diverted, thus stranding many passengers along the way. Every airport from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Tampa, Florida was temporarily closed due to the storm. Highways were also closed or restricted all across the affected region, even in states generally well prepared for snow emergencies.

Some affected areas in the Appalachian Mountain region saw of snow, and snowdrifts as high as . Mount Le Conte, Tennessee recorded 56&quot; and Mount Mitchell, NC recorded of snowfall. The volume of the storm&#x27;s total snowfall was later computed to be , an amount which would weigh (depending on the variable density of snow) between 5.4 and 27 billion tons.

The weight of the record snowfalls collapsed several factory roofs in the South; and snowdrifts on the windward sides of buildings caused a few decks with substandard anchoring to fall from homes. Though the storm was forecast to strike the snow-prone Appalachian Mountains, hundreds of people were nonetheless rescued from the Appalachians, many caught completely off guard on the Appalachian Trail or in cabins and lodges in remote locales. Snowdrifts up to were observed at Mount Mitchell. Snowfall totals of between were widespread across northwestern North Carolina. Boone, North Carolina—in a high-elevation area accustomed to heavy snowfalls—was nonetheless caught off-guard by more than of snow and 24 hours of temperatures below . Boone&#x27;s Appalachian State University closed that week, for the first time in its history. Stranded motorists at Deep Gap broke into Parkway Elementary School to survive, and National Guard helicopters dropped hay in fields to keep livestock from starving in northern N.C. mountain counties.

In Virginia, the LancerLot sports arena in Vinton collapsed due to the weight of the record snowfall, forcing the Virginia Lancers of the ECHL to relocate to nearby Roanoke and become the Roanoke Express. Also collapsing were the roofs of a Lowe&#x27;s store in Christiansburg and the Dedmon Center, at Radford University. Thousands of travelers were stranded along interstate highways in Southwest Virginia.
Electricity was not restored to many isolated rural areas for up to three weeks, with power outages occurring all over the east. Nearly 60,000 lightning strikes were recorded as the storm swept over the country for a total of 72 hours. As one of the most powerful, complex storms in recent history, this storm was described as the &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; by many of the areas affected.

A hockey game hosted by the Philadelphia Flyers against the Los Angeles Kings was postponed due to a large window breaking from wind gusts just before the end of the first period.

===Gulf of Mexico===
The United States Coast Guard dealt with &quot;absolutely incredible, unbelievable&quot; conditions within the Gulf of Mexico. The freighter &quot;Fantastico&quot; sank off Ft. Myers, Florida, and seven of her crew died when a Coast Guard helicopter was forced back to base due to low fuel levels after rescuing three of her crew. The freighter &quot;Miss Beholden&quot; ran aground on a coral reef from Key West, Florida. Several other smaller vessels sank in the rough seas. In all, the Coast Guard rescued 235 people from over 100 boats across the Gulf of Mexico during the tempest.

===Florida===
Besides producing record-low barometric pressure across a swath of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states, and contributing to one of the nation&#x27;s biggest snowstorms, the low produced a potent squall line ahead of its cold front. The squall line produced a serial derecho as it moved into Florida and Cuba shortly after midnight on March 13. Straight-line winds gusted above at many locations in Florida as the squall line moved through. A substantial tree fall was seen statewide from this system. The supercells in the derecho produced eleven tornadoes. The first tornado was an F2 that touched down in Chiefland at 04:38 UTC on March 13, damaging several mobile homes and downing trees and power lines. Three people were killed and seven people sustained injures. Around the same time, an F1 tornado was spawned near Crystal River. After moving eastward into the town, the twister damaged 15 homes, several of them severely. A total of three people were injured. The next tornado was a waterspout that moved ashore over Treasure Island around 05:00 UTC. Rated F0, the tornado deroofed one home, damaged several others, and impacted a few boats.

Around 05:04 UTC, an F0 tornado was reported in New Port Richey, damaging several homes and injuring 11 people. About 16 minutes later, an F2 tornado formed to the southwest of Ocala. Many trees fell and several storage buildings and a warehouse suffered extensive damage, while one hangar was destroyed and two others received major damage at the Ocala International Airport. At 05:20 UTC, approximately the same time as the Ocala tornado, another twister – rated F1 – touched down near LaCrosse. Several trees and power lines were downed and a few homes were destroyed, one from a propane explosion. One person was killed and four others received injuries. About 10 minutes later, another F2 twister was spawned near Howey-in-the-Hills. It moved through Mount Dora, destroying 13 homes, substantially damaging 80 homes, and inflicting minor damage on 266 homes. One person, a 5-month-old baby, was killed, while two others were injured.

At 05:30 UTC, a waterspout-turned F0 tornado tossed a sailboat about at the Davis Islands yacht club in Tampa, while five other boats broke loose from their cradles and twelve were smashed into the seawall. About 30 minutes later,
an F1 tornado formed in Jacksonville, demolishing four dwellings and damaging sixteen others. Also at 06:00 UTC, an F0 tornado spawned near Bartow snapped a few trees and damaged a few doors. The eleventh and final tornado developed in Jacksonville at 06:10 UTC. The twister damaged a few trees near the Jacksonville International Airport. At the airport itself, the tornado damaged several jetways and service vehicles, while a Boeing 737 was pushed about .

A substantial storm surge was also generated along the gulf coast from Apalachee Bay in the Florida Panhandle to north of Tampa Bay. Due to the angle of the coast relative to the approaching squall, Taylor County along the eastern portion of Apalachee Bay and Hernando County north of Tampa were especially hard-hit.

Storm surges in those areas reached up to , higher than many hurricanes. With little advance warning of incoming severe conditions, some coastal residents were awakened in the early morning of March 13 by the waters of the Gulf of Mexico rushing into their homes. More people died from drowning in this storm than during Hurricanes Hugo and Andrew combined. Overall, the storm&#x27;s surge, winds, and tornadoes damaged or destroyed 18,000 homes. A total of 47 people died in Florida due to this storm.

Despite all the rainfall and tornadoes, lots of snow also dropped in the Panhandle regions of Florida. Areas saw snow of up to 1 foot near the coast and inland. In Tallahassee, around 1 to 2 inches of snow were dropped to the ground. In Jacksonville and Fernandina beach, traces of snow were seen in the air. Very cold temperatures were also seen in the state. Snow was seen as far south as Tampa Bay in central Florida. Tallahassee&#x27;s lowest temperature was 17 degrees F (-8 degrees C). On March 13, Orlando saw 26 degrees F (-3 degrees C), and Miami saw 39 degrees F (4 degrees C) that same day. In Orlando, there were mixed precipitations with rain, sleet and snow combined. Miami saw near record cold temperatures for the month of March, making it a very rare phenomenon for Florida; Florida is usually mild all year round.

===Cuba===
In Cuba, wind gusts reached in the Havana area. A survey conducted by a research team from the Institute of Meteorology of Cuba suggests that the maximum winds could have been as high as . It is the most damaging squall line ever recorded in Cuba.

There was widespread and significant damage in Cuba, with damage estimated as intense as F2. The squall line finally moved out of Cuba near sunrise, leaving 10 deaths and US$1 billion in damage on the island.

===North Atlantic===
The cargo ship &quot;Gold Bond Conveyor&quot; en route from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada to Tampa, Florida foundered in the Atlantic Ocean SE of Sable Island, Nova Scotia with the loss of all 33 crew. It is thought that water entered the hold where gypsum ore was being stored and caused the rock to shift and harden. This instability compounded with winds of and waves led to her sinking. The Liberian-flagged ship was owned by Skaarup Shipping Corp., of Greenwich, Connecticut, and under charter to National Gypsum Co., a U.S. company. The ship had previously survived the Perfect Storm of 1991 two years earlier.

<text>Thomas Colley Grattan (1792 – 4 July 1864) was an Irish novelist, poet, dramatist, travel writer, historian and diplomat. Born in Dublin, he was educated for the law, but did not practise. He wrote a few novels, including &quot;The Heiress of Bruges&quot; (4 volumes, 1830); but his best work was &quot;Highways and Byways&quot;, a description of his Continental travels, of which he published three series, amounting to eight volumes. He also wrote a history of the Netherlands and books on America. He was for some time British Consul at Boston in the United States and assisted in the negotiations leading to the Webster–Ashburton Treaty in 1842.

==Life==
Grattan was son of Colley Grattan of Clayton Lodge, County Kildare, a solicitor in Dublin who became a farmer. The family was part of the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy and Grattan was related to both the Irish politician Henry Grattan and the Duke of Wellington. He was educated in Athy by the Reverend Henry Bristow, after which he was sent to Dublin to study law. He then accepted a commission in the Louth militia. In 1810, while stationed in Waterford, he met the actor Edmund Kean following a performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The two became friends, and years later Grattan wrote a play for him.

After leaving the army, Grattan decided to take part in the South American wars of independence. He embarked for Bordeaux in 1818, with the intention of taking a ship from there to Venezuela, but on his passage met Eliza O&#x27;Donnel. He married her and settled near Bordeaux. It was here that he started as a writer, beginning with &quot;Philibert&quot;, an octo-syllabic poem in six cantos. Soon after he moved to Paris, where he met Thomas Moore, Washington Irving, Adolphe Thiers, Béranger, Lamartine, and other distinguished literary men, and became a steady contributor to the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;, &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, the &quot;New Monthly Magazine&quot;, and other periodicals. His translations from French poets were successful. He also ran a serial of his own, &quot;The Paris Monthly Review of British and Continental Literature, by a Society of English Gentlemen&quot;. No. 1 came out in January 1822, and No. 15 (April 1823) appears to have been the last issue of this magazine. By Washington Irving&#x27;s advice he edited notes of some of his tours, and submitted the manuscript to four publishing houses, who all rejected it. This work was &quot;Highways and Byways, or Tales of the Roadside&quot;,’ which, on its appearance in 1823, dedicated to Washington Irving, made its author&#x27;s name widely known both in England and on the continent, and was several times reprinted. The second series of these tales came out in 1825, and the third in 1827. Grattan&#x27;s next public appearance was as the writer of a tragedy, &quot;Ben Nazir, the Saracen&quot;. This was produced by Kean at Drury Lane Theatre on 21 May 1827, but the actor, through ill-health and domestic misfortunes, broke down, and the play failed with him.

With money troubles, Grattan moved to Brussels in about 1828. He there produced &quot;Traits of Travel&quot;, which was well received; &quot;The Heiress of Bruges&quot;, a historical romance; and &quot;The History of the Netherlands&quot;, became a standard work. In 1830 the revolution drove him from Brussels; his house was almost destroyed by cannon and his property was pillaged. He retired to Antwerp, and accompanied the Prince of Orange from that city to The Hague, where he wrote &quot;Jacqueline of Holland&quot;. In May 1831 he was at Heidelberg, where he composed the &quot;Legends of the Rhine&quot;. About the same time (1832) he was appointed gentleman of the privy chamber to William IV. Returning to Brussels he was well received by King Leopold, and henceforth for some years again resided in Belgium. He was now a frequent contributor to the British and foreign reviews, writing on the state of European affairs, mainly in connection with Belgium.

At a critical moment in the affairs of the new kingdom, during the riots at Brussels in 1834, Grattan began a correspondence with &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, and his letters were translated and reproduced in continental journals. His services were acknowledged by Leopold, and partly owing to his influence he, in 1839, received the appointment of British consul to the state of Massachusetts. He moved in the summer of that year, and took up his residence at Boston. At this period the controversy between the American states and the British provinces relative to the north-eastern boundary was the absorbing topic. Grattan made himself completely master of the subject, and communicated his opinions to Lord Ashburton when that nobleman arrived in the United States in 1842 as minister plenipotentiary for the purpose of settling the boundary question. Grattan was unanimously chosen by both parties to assist at the negotiations at Washington, and contributed to the conclusion of the treaty of 9 April 1842. In the United States Grattan gained considerable reputation as a speaker and raconteur.

Returning to England in 1846 Grattan was permitted, in consideration of his services, to resign his consulship in favour of his eldest son Edmund Grattan. From this period he mainly resided in London, where he resumed his literary labours, and among other works produced, in 2 vols., in 1862, &quot;Beaten Paths and those who trod them&quot;, which contains autobiographical recollections.

Grattan died at his residence in Jermyn Street, London, 4 July 1864, leaving a daughter and three sons.

<doc id="1078564" wikidata="Q3687809" url="?curid=1078564" title="Earl Cornwallis">
<text>Earl Cornwallis was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain created in 1753 for Charles Cornwallis, 5th Baron Cornwallis. The second Earl was created Marquess Cornwallis but this title became extinct upon the death of the second marquessate in 1823, while the earldom and its subsidiary titles became extinct in 1852 (the barony was recreated in the 20th century).

The Cornwallis family descended from Frederick Cornwallis, who represented Eye and Ipswich in the House of Commons. He was created a Baronet in the Baronetage of England in 1627 and [[Baron Cornwallis]], of Eye in the County of Suffolk, in the Peerage of England in 1661. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron, who also sat as Member of Parliament for Eye. On his death, the titles passed to his son, the third Baron. He notably served as First Lord of the Admiralty. His son, the fourth Baron, was Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk and Postmaster General.

He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baron. In 1753, he was created Viscount Brome, in the County of Suffolk, and Earl Cornwallis in the Peerage of Great Britain. His son, the second Earl, was a noted military commander, best known as one of the leading British generals in the American War of Independence; his surrender at Yorktown ended the war. He subsequently served as Commander-in-Chief of India. In 1792 he was created Marquess Cornwallis in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He represented Eye (which by this time was considered a pocket borough of the Cornwallis family) and Suffolk in Parliament. Lord Cornwallis had four daughters but no sons, and the marquessate became extinct on his death in 1823. He was succeeded in the other titles by his uncle, the fourth Earl. He was Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry from 1781 to 1824. He married Catherine, daughter of Galfridus Mann of Boughton Malherbe in Kent. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Eye. In 1814, Lord Cornwallis assumed by Royal licence his maternal grandfather&#x27;s surname of Mann. He had no surviving male issue and the earldom, viscountcy, barony and baronetcy became extinct on his death in 1852. His daughter Lady Jemima Isabella married Charles Wykeham-Martin. 

Their son Fiennes Wykeham-Martin assumed by Royal licence the surname of Cornwallis in 1859. In 1927, the Cornwallis title was revived when his son Fiennes Cornwallis was raised to the peerage as Baron Cornwallis, of Linton, in the County of Kent.

Several other members of the Cornwallis family also gained distinction. The Hon. Edward Cornwallis, the sixth son of the fourth Baron, was a soldier and is known as the founder of Halifax. His younger twin brother, the Right Reverend the Hon. Frederick Cornwallis, was Archbishop of Canterbury. The Hon. William Cornwallis, younger son of the first Earl and younger brother of the first Marquess, was an admiral in the Royal Navy.

<text>The River City Brass Band (River City Brass, RCB) is a modified British-style brass band based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The twenty-eight-piece ensemble tours extensively throughout the United States and performs more than thirty-five concerts each year as part of its community concert series in Western Pennsylvania.

It received a standing ovation from a crowd of one thousand after making its public debut at the Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh&#x27;s Oakland neighborhood on Saturday evening, November 21, 1981 during Pittsburgh&#x27;s British Festival.

Within six years of its founding, this ensemble had &quot;gained a national reputation as one of America&#x27;s most popular touring attractions,&quot; according to the Elmira &quot;Star-Gazette&quot;, and, by the mid-1990s, was known as &quot;one of America&#x27;s premier brass ensembles.&quot;

==Ensemble history==
 Building upon the long-standing tradition of brass bands popularized in Great Britain and the United States, the River City Brass (RCB) is staffed by twenty-five brass players and three percussionists. RCB differs from most brass bands, however, in that its instrumentation has been altered. French Horns are used instead of alto horns, and an Eb soprano trumpet is employed in place of a soprano cornet, creating a lighter, brighter, more &quot;orchestral&quot; sound than the traditional brass band.

On November 21, 1981, the RCB performed under the baton of conductor Robert Bernat at the Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh during its inaugural concert. Among the performers during that first RCB concert were British musicians Robert Childs, a renowned euphonium performer with the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and Arthur Taylor, a British brass band concert producer who served as the master of ceremonies for the RCB event. Enid Hattersley, then lord mayor of Sheffield, England, Pittsburgh&#x27;s sister city, also participated, and was described by one area newspaper as &quot;feisty and funny.&quot;

Since that time, the ensemble has been a featured performer at the Adelaide Festival of the Arts (Australia), Musikfest (Pennsylvania), Chautauqua Institution (New York), New Zealand International Festival of the Arts, Interlochen Center for the Arts (Michigan), and Thalian Hall (North Carolina), among many other venues across the United States and world.

According to the ensemble&#x27;s website, “The mission of the River City Brass is to propagate and perpetuate musical culture, primarily American musical culture, across a broad spectrum of the public through the presentation of brass band performances, educational programs and the production of recordings. The River City Brass has as its central obligation service to the people of Western Pennsylvania.”

To that end, River City Brass members have operated a youth program since 1986. Known as the River City Youth Brass Band, it enables young musicians to hone their craft under the close supervision of professional players.

Since August 2010, the River City Brass has been led by internationally renowned tuba soloist and British conductor, James Gourlay.

<doc id="1078575" wikidata="Q6644607" url="?curid=1078575" title="Plumas Lake, California">
<text>Plumas Lake is a master-planned exurb and census-designated place in Yuba County, California. It is located north of Sacramento and south of Marysville off California State Route 70. Its population was 8,126 at the 2020 census.

Plumas Lake was first conceived in 1993 as a means to guide development along the Feather and Bear Rivers. Construction began in 2003 and at full build-out the community is expected to have roughly 12,000 homes and 36,000 residents.

==History==
There was previously a settlement called Plumas Landing (also known as Plumas City) west of Plumas Lake on the bank of the Feather River. The old settlement was impacted by Gold rush-era hydraulic mining in the Yuba River watershed upstream. Mine tailings wound up in the riverbeds and were then transported into the Sacramento Valley, where they accumulated in the river channels and reduced their conveyance capacities.

Flood risk has been a concern throughout Plumas Lake&#x27;s development and many individuals and agencies were opposed to its construction. The area that would become the community of Plumas Lake experienced major floods in 1986 and 1997. Despite this, the first master plan for Plumas Lake was approved in 1993 and construction started early 2003.

In the years since construction began the levee infrastructure has improved significantly. In 2019, FEMA accredited the community with moderate-to-low flood risk. The community is rated against 200-year floods which equates to a 1 in 200 chance (0.5% probability) that a flood will occur in any given year. Improvements to existing water management infrastructure could enable 500-year flood protection in the future.

==Geography==
Plumas Lake is located at (39.0207272, -121.5580176). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP of Plumas Lake covers an area of , all of it land. It lies at an elevation of . It shares the same ZIP code as Olivehurst, California, a neighboring community.

Plumas Lake is in the southern tip of Yuba County near the confluence of the Feather and Bear Rivers. The community&#x27;s north and south ends are connected by River Oaks Boulevard and Algodon Slough, a seasonal backwater that flows into the Bear River. A common misconception is that the community is built on top of a dry lake. The old lake is actually located northwest of the community and is now mostly agricultural land.

Since Plumas Lake is an unincorporated community there are a few ways to define its borders. The most popular definition is the census-designated place which includes land south of Algodon Road, north of Bear River, and some adjacent rural areas. The Plumas Lake Specific Plan&#x27;s definition extends even further north to include the Olivehurst suburb of Wheeler Ranch, Plumas Lake Golf Club, Arboga, and rural areas in between. The largest definition is the Plumas Lake ZIP code area which includes land east of the Feather River, west of Forty Mile Road, and everything north of Bear River up to the new developments along Arboga Road.

===Climate===

<text>John Richard Green (12 December 1837 – 7 March 1883) was an English historian.

== Early life ==
Green was born on 12 December 1837, the son of a tradesman in Oxford, where he was educated, first at Magdalen College School, and then at Jesus College, Oxford, where he is commemorated by the J. R. Green Society, which meets several times a term and is run by students from the undergraduate body. He grew up in a high-church Tory family from which he rebelled as early as 1850, being &quot;temporarily banished from his uncle&#x27;s house for ridiculing the uproar over &#x27;Papal Aggression.&#x27;&quot;

== Career ==
=== Ecclesiastical career ===
He entered the church, being ordained to the diaconate in 1860, and served various cures in London, under a constant strain caused by delicate health. Always an enthusiastic student of history, the little leisure time he had was devoted to research.

=== Turn to historical writings ===
In 1869 he finally gave up his work as a clergyman, and was appointed librarian at Lambeth. He had been laying plans for various historical works, including a History of the English Church as exhibited in a series of Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, and, what he proposed as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, a history of England under the Angevin kings. After suffering from failing health he abandoned these projects and instead concentrated his energies on the preparation of his &quot;A Short History of the English People&quot;, which appeared in 1874, and at once gave him an assured place in the first rank of historical writers.

Abandoning his proposed history of the Angevins, he confined himself to expanding his &quot;Short History&quot; into &quot;A History of the English People&quot; in four volumes (1878–1880) and writing &quot;The Making of England&quot;, of which one volume only, coming down to 828, had appeared when he died at Mentone in March 1883. After his death appeared &quot;The Conquest of England&quot;. The &quot;Short History&quot;, which in 1915 was republished as part of the Everyman Library, may be said to have begun a new epoch in the writing of history, making the social, industrial, and moral progress of the people its main theme. It sold 235,000 copies in England alone.

More recently J. W. Burrow proposed that Green, like William Stubbs and Edward Augustus Freeman, was a historical scholar with little or no experience of public affairs, with views of the present that were Romantically historicised, and who was drawn to history by what was in a broad sense an antiquarian passion for the past, as well as a patriotic and populist impulse to identify the nation and its institutions as the collective subject of English history, making 
== Personal life and death ==

In 1877 he married Alice Stopford.

During the 1870s Green suffered from lung problems. His wife assisted him in carrying out and completing his work as his broken health took its toll during his few remaining years. He died on 7 March 1883.

<text>Gerald Griffin (; 12 December 1803 – 12 June 1840) was an Irish-born novelist, poet and playwright. His novel &quot;The Collegians&quot; was the basis of Dion Boucicault&#x27;s play &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot;. Feeling he was &quot;wasting his time&quot; writing fiction, he joined the Christian Brothers, a Catholic religious congregation founded by Edmund Ignatius Rice to teach the children of the poor.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gerald Griffin was born in Limerick in 1803, the youngest son of thirteen children of a substantial Catholic farming family. Patrick Griffin, his father, also made a living through brewing, and he participated as one of Grattan&#x27;s Irish Volunteers. His mother came from the ancient Irish family of the O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s, and first introduced Gerald to English literature. When he was aged seven, Griffin&#x27;s family moved to Fairy Lawn, a house near Loghill, County Limerick, which sat on a hill above the bank of the Shannon estuary, about twenty-seven miles from Limerick. Here Griffin had an idyllic childhood and received a classical education. &quot;When free from his books he was wont to roam through the neighbouring countries, so rich in ruins, which told him of the past glories of his native land. At that time, too he got an insight into the customs of the people and became familiar with the popular legends and folk-tales which he later worked into his stories.&quot;

===London===
In 1820 the family at Fairy Lawn was broken up. The parents with several of the children emigrated to America and settled in the state of Pennsylvania. Gerald, with one brother and two sisters, was left behind under the care of his elder brother William, a practising physician in Adare, County Limerick. Griffin met John Banim in Limerick city. Inspired by the successful production of Banim&#x27;s play &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot; (1821), Griffin moved to London in 1823; he was nineteen years of age. After an unsuccessful attempt at becoming a playwright, Griffin endured years of poverty in London, managing only to scrape by through writing reviews for periodicals and newspapers. At the end of two years he obtained steady employment in the publishing house as reader and reviser of manuscripts, and in a short time became a frequent contributor to some of the leading periodicals and magazines. Griffin&#x27;s early &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; pieces vividly described the rural setting of his childhood; recounted Irish folklore; translated the Celtic Irish language for the English readers; and, as Robert Lee Wolff has observed, &quot;waxed richly sardonic about Irishmen who tried to be more English than the English.&quot;

===Return===
Griffin&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Holland-Tide;&quot; or, Munster Popular Tales&quot; was published by in 1827. &quot;Holland-Tide&quot; is a collection of seven short stories, all of which are told in the house of a hospitable Munster farmer during All Hallows&#x27; Eve in Munster. &quot;Holland-Tide&quot; established his reputation and he returned to Ireland, where he wrote &quot;Tales of the Munster Festivals&quot; in Pallaskenry to which his brother William had moved. 

Experience led Griffin to modify his expectations in relation to literary work, and, with a view to the legal profession, he entered as a law student at the University of London, but in a short time removed to Dublin for the study of ancient Irish history, preparatory to his work &quot;The Invasion&quot;, which was published in 1832. This work had a good sale and was highly praised by scholars, but never became popular.
===Christian brother===
With the exception of a tour through Scotland and a short trip on the Continent, he lived with his brother, keeping up to some extent his literary labours. By 1833, Griffin was increasingly concerned that &quot;he was wasting his time&quot;, and began to devote himself to teaching the poor children of the neighbourhood. In 1838, Griffin burnt all of his unpublished manuscripts and joined the Congregation of Christian Brothers, a Catholic religious order which has as its special aim the education of children of the poor. Writing to an old friend he said &quot;he felt a great deal happier in the practice of this daily routine than he ever did while roving about the great city, absorbed in the modest project of rivalling Shakespeare and throwing Scott in the shade&quot;. In June, 1839, he was transferred from Dublin to Cork, where he died of typhus fever at the age of thirty-six. 

==Legacy==
However, his play &quot;Gisippus&quot; was produced posthumously at the Drury Lane Theatre on February 23, 1842 by William Macready, and it ran to a second edition in print.

One of Griffin&#x27;s most famous works is &quot;The Collegians&quot;, a novel based on a trial that he had reported on, involving the murder of a young Irish Catholic girl (Ellen Hanley) by a Protestant Anglo-Irish man (John Scanlon). The novel was later adapted for the stage as &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot; by Dion Boucicault.

He has a street named after him in Limerick City and another in Cork City, Ireland. Loughill/Ballyhahill GAA club in west Limerick play under the name of &quot;Gerald Griffins&quot;.

<text>Francis Hindes Groome (30 August 1851 – 24 January 1902) was a writer and foremost commentator of his time on the Romani people, their language, life, history, customs, beliefs, and lore.

He was the son of Robert Hindes Groome, Archdeacon of Suffolk.

==Life==
Groome was born at his father&#x27;s rectory in Monk Soham, Suffolk, on 30 August 1851. He was educated at Ipswich School, where his lifelong interest in Romanies was sparked, and continued at Oxford University. He left Oxford without taking a degree, spent some time at the University of Göttingen, in Germany, and then for six years lived with Romani at home and abroad. He married a woman of Romani blood, Esmeralda Locke, in 1876 and settled down to regular literary work in Edinburgh.

Groome contributed generously and on a variety of subjects to such publications as the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, &quot;Johnson&#x27;s Universal Cyclopedia&quot;, &quot;The Bookman&quot;, &quot;Chambers&#x27; Biographical Dictionary&quot;, the &quot;Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland&quot; (in six volumes), and as joint editor, with his father and poet Edward Fitzgerald, of &quot;Suffolk Notes and Queries&quot; for the &quot;Ipswich Journal&quot;.

His article on &#x27;Gipsies&#x27;, in the ninth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, made him known to the world as a &quot;gypsyologist&quot;. In 1899 he published his most significant book for folklorists, &quot;Gypsy Folk-Tales&quot;. These well-annotated collections are a significant addition to the comparative study of the world&#x27;s folktales. He also co-edited the first three volumes of &quot;Gypsy Lore Society&#x27;s Journal&quot;, and wrote nineteen brief articles and collections of folktales for it.

He wrote a number of books including a novel of Romani life, an English–Scottish border history, a sketch of his father and Fitzgerald, and an autobiographical account of his time living with the Romani.

Groome was a sub-editor of &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot;; joint-editor of the 1897 edition of &quot;Chamber&#x27;s Dictionary of Biography&quot;.

A singularly alert, swift, and eager intellect, he was unwearied in research, impatient of anything less than precision, a frank and fearless critic; thoroughly at home in wide fields of historical and philological research, and in some of them a master. He was nicknamed the “Tarno Rye”.

==Death==
Groome died on 24 January 1902, aged 50, in London. He was buried at Monk Soham, Suffolk.

==Legacy==
In October 1901, Groome&#x27;s library of books, letters, and manuscripts bearing upon the study of the Romani was purchased by the Boston Athenæum. The collection comprises over one hundred volumes, some which are rare, and others contain rare tracts and magazine articles. There are also Groome&#x27;s own books with his marginal additions, over thirty volumes of manuscript notes, lectures, and his correspondence with M. Paul Bataillard, the eminent French student of the Romani, covering the years 1872 to 1880.

<doc id="1078597" wikidata="Q4150369" url="?curid=1078597" title="Francis Grose">
<text>Francis Grose (before 11June 173112May 1791) was an English antiquary, draughtsman, and lexicographer. He produced &quot;A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot; (1785) and &quot;A Provincial Glossary, with a Collection of Local Proverbs, and Popular Superstitions&quot; (1787).

==Early life==
Grose was born at his father&#x27;s house in Broad Street, St-Peter-le-Poer, London. His parents were Swiss immigrant and jeweller Francis Jacob Grose (d. 1769), and his wife, Anne (d. 1773), daughter of Thomas Bennett of Greenford in Middlesex. Grose was baptised on 11 June 1731 in the parish of St Peter-le-Poer.

The eldest of seven children, Grose probably received a classical education but first aimed at a career in the Army. In 1747, he was in Flanders, apparently as a volunteer in Howard&#x27;s (later 19th) regiment of foot: later he received a commission as cornet in Cobham&#x27;s (later 10th) regiment of dragoons. Posted to Kent on excise duties in 1750, he met and married Catherine Jordan of Canterbury. They were eventually to have ten children, six of whom survived to adulthood. Their eldest son, also called Francis Grose, was the Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, Australia from 1792 to 1794.

Grose left the army in October 1751, possibly to avoid his regiment&#x27;s posting to Scotland. In 1755, his father bought him the post of Richmond Herald but Francis showed little interest in heraldry and was to sell it again in February 1763. In 1757, Grose was elected a member of the Society of Antiquaries, and 1759 he resumed his soldiering career, this time in the militia, which meant he could avoid distant postings. He was commissioned into the Surrey Militia as lieutenant and adjutant, and it was his subsequent promotion to captain in 1765 that led to his adoption of the familiar title &quot;Captain Grose&quot;. The Surrey militia was disembodied in 1762 but this hardly affected Grose, who continued to receive a salary as paymaster and adjutant even in peacetime. With bequests from his parents and from his wife, who died in 1774, added to the salary he drew as a militia captain, Grose at this time was able to live reasonably well despite the demands made on his purse by the need to raise, educate and provide for his children.

==Books and publications==
Grose had early on shown a keen interest in drawing, having attempted sketches of medieval buildings as far back as 1749, and having taken formal instruction at a drawing school in the mid-1750s. He was not a particularly gifted draughtsman but he mixed in the London artistic milieu and began to exhibit, first at the Society of Artists in 1767–8 and then at the Royal Academy. His interest was in the field of medieval remains, which were beginning to exercise an increasing grip on the public imagination. In 1772, he published the first part of &quot;The Antiquities of England and Wales&quot;, a work which he unashamedly aimed at the popular market. Essentially, it targeted those who wanted to know about antiquities but had neither time nor means to visit them in person, and contained small panoramas of medieval ruins, together with an informative text on a separate page. Sometimes the text was taken from books already published, or from information supplied by other antiquaries (both acknowledged); sometimes Grose collated material himself from which he could work up an article. From 1772 onwards, he also toured the country to visit and draw sites for inclusion in &quot;The Antiquities&quot;. The fourth and last volume came out in June 1776, and Grose almost immediately began work on a supplement.

His publishing career was interrupted however, when the Surrey militia was again called into service between 1778 and 1783. This was not a happy experience for him. Where previously Grose had been able to spend his summers visiting and sketching ancient sites, he was now obliged to attend his regiment in various training camps. He did not get on well with his new commanding officer, and he handled regimental finances in a slipshod manner. The result was that he incurred debts towards fellow officers that would take years to straighten out. The financial pressure forced him to increase both the rate and the range of his publications.
The Supplement to &quot;The Antiquities&quot; was resumed in 1783, this time with a higher proportion of the illustrations being done by other artists. Drawing on his own fieldwork, Grose also branched out into producing dictionaries, including the famous &quot;A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot; (1785) and &quot;A Provincial Glossary, with a Collection of Local Proverbs, and Popular Superstitions&quot; (1787). Though intended to amuse, they give an unusually vivid picture of the speech of the day which would not normally find inclusion in standard dictionaries, and contained, in all, about 9,000 terms which more scholarly works of the time habitually overlooked. He produced books on military antiquities and armour, as well as satirical essays, and in 1788 began the first of several tours of Scotland in order to produce &quot;The Antiquities of Scotland&quot;. It was on the second of these tours, in summer 1789, that he met and immediately formed a friendship with the poet Robert Burns. Burns met him while he was staying with Robert Riddell at the Friar&#x27;s Carse, collecting material for his Scottish work. Burns suggested to him that he should include Alloway Kirk in his Scottish &quot;Antiquities&quot;, and Grose agreed on condition that Burns provided a witch tale to go with his drawing. In June 1790, Burns sent Grose a prose tale with a variant in a letter to Grose, following it up with a rhymed version, &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;.

Grose was the first art critic to affirm, in his &quot;Rules for drawing caricaturas: with an essay on comic painting&quot; (1788), published in William Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;The Analysis of Beauty&quot; (1791 edition), that aesthetic emotions emerge from a specific &quot;cultural&quot; environment, and that aesthetics are neither innate nor universal, but formed by their cultural context. Grose therefore has a claim to be considered as the first critical &quot;aesthetic regionalist theorist&quot; in proclaiming the anti-universality of aesthetics.

==Death==

While on an expedition to Ireland to collect antiquarian material, Grose died in Dublin at the house of Horace Hone, of an apoplectic stroke. His father had built a house, known as Richmond, in Drumcondra before his death. He was buried on 18 May 1791, at Drumcondra cemetery. His nephew Daniel and a Dr. Edward Ledwich, who had already published a book on Irish antiquities, completed the final volume of Grose&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of Ireland&quot; in 1791.

==Other works==
In addition to the books above mentioned, Grose wrote a &quot;Treatise on Ancient Armour and Weapons&quot;.

Additionally, it is noted that he was the (anonymous) author of &quot;Advice to the Officers of the British Army: With the addition of some Hints to the Drummer and Private Soldier&quot;, which was published in 1783 as a mocking look backwards on the conduct of the war against the American Colonies. Every instance of corruption, disregard and vice are suggested for every rank of the army. Tongue in cheek, but obviously rooted in truth, it is a great companion to &quot;Vulgar Tongue&quot;. It also contains a satirical portrait of Jeremiah Hodges, Grose&#x27;s erstwhile commanding officer in the Surrey militia.

Two parodies by Thomas Bridges, &quot;A Travestie of Homer&quot; and &quot;The Battle of the Genii&quot;, were formerly erroneously attributed to Francis Grose.

<text>George Grub (1812–1892) was a Scottish law professor and church historian.

==Life==
Grub was born at Old Aberdeen on 4 April 1812, the only child of George Grub, a respectable citizen and convener of the trades at Old Aberdeen, and his wife, Christian Yolum. 

He entered King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, at the age of thirteen and a half, and afterwards entered the law-office of Alexander Allan, advocate in Aberdeen, under whom he served the apprenticeship required by the Society of Advocates in Aberdeen. Passing as advocate in 1836, he was in 1841 appointed librarian to the society and he held this post until his death. In 1843 he became lecturer on Scots law in Marischal College, Aberdeen, and for forty-eight years was practically the sole teacher of law in the university of Aberdeen first, as holding this lectureship; next, after the union of King&#x27;s and Marischal Colleges (1860–81), as &#x27;substitute&#x27; for Professor Patrick Davidson, who held the chair of law at King&#x27;s College, but never lectured. After Davidson&#x27;s death in 1881, Grub became professor of law in the University of Aberdeen. In 1856, he graduated A.M. at Aberdeen, and in 1864 he received the degree of LL.D. from his university, and on resigning the chair in 1891 he was presented by his former students and fellow-citizens with his portrait painted by Sir George Reid.

By birth an inheritor of the Scottish non-juring tradition, he was himself an accomplished theologian. He had followed with enthusiasm the whole course of the Oxford Movement; and in the congregation to which he belonged (St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Aberdeen) he had supported his clergyman, Patrick Cheyne, throughout a prosecution in regard to eucharistic doctrine, which had weighty consequences, for it led to the charge and prosecution of the bishop of Brechin, Alexander Penrose Forbes, and the intervention of Pusey and Keble in defence of that prelate. It took some time to heal the sores occasioned by that controversy.

There was at Aberdeen in the early 1830s a group of young men, all of them Aberdeen lawyers, all of them episcopalians, and all of them earnest students of history and antiquities John Hill Burton, Joseph Robertson (1810-1866), and John Stuart (1813-1877). With these Grub associated on equal terms. Like them he contributed to the &quot;Aberdeen Magazine&quot; (1831-2), and took part in a far more important undertaking, the formation of the Spalding Club. For this club he edited (1840-2), in conjunction with Joseph Robertson, James Gordon&#x27;s &quot;History of Scots Affairs,&quot; 3 vols. (1853), Thomas Innes&#x27;s &quot;History of Scotland, Civil and Ecclesiastical&quot; (the &quot;Life of Thomas Innes&quot; which he contributed to this volume was reprinted in the edition of Innes&#x27;s &quot;Critical Essays,&quot; published in the &quot;Historians of Scotland&quot; series), and (1869) the index volume of the &quot;Illustrations of the Antiquities of Aberdeen and Banff.&quot;

In 1861, his own work, by which he is best known, &quot;An Ecclesiastical History of Scotland from the Introduction of Christianity to the Present Time&quot; (it closes with the death of Bishop Skinner on 15 April 1857), in four volumes, was published at Edinburgh, and at once stamped him as the foremost authority on the subject in Scotland.

Clear and unaffected in style, this work is learned and exact, but it suffers somewhat from the fact that his extreme scrupulosity as to literal truth caused him to hold too severely in check the wit and liveliness which were so conspicuous and charming in his conversation. As an historian he was determined to be fair, albeit he is at no pains to conceal (what he was proud of) his enthusiastic toryism and his profound attachment to the Scottish Episcopal Church. In the preface, Grub acknowledges the help he had received from Joseph Robertson and Norval Clyne; he regrets that for the history of the Roman Catholic church after the Reformation he had not been able to obtain more accurate materials; and he says that the work had occupied him more than nine years. In spite of the more recent researches on the Celtic period of Scottish history, the book is by no means out of date; but it is unfortunate that no second edition of it was called for until Grub was too old to undertake the labour of preparing one. He had made notes for this which it is understood were lent to the Rev. W. Stephen, D.D., Dumbarton, for his &quot;History&quot;.
Grub contributed to &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopædia&quot; the articles &quot;Scotland&quot; and &quot;Church of Scotland;&quot; that on &quot;Scottish Literature&quot; in the earlier editions was also his, but failing health prevented him from undertaking its revision for the new edition.

To the Aberdeen Philosophical Society, he contributed the &quot;Life of Bishop Elphinstone;&quot; &quot;The Life of Bishop Burnet, and his Character as a Historian and Biographer;&quot; &quot;Dr. James Beattie and his Friends;&quot; &quot;The Antiquities of Dunkeld;&quot; &quot;Froude&#x27;s History and Mary, Queen of Scots;&quot; &quot;Elgin Cathedral;&quot; &quot;Review of the Evidence as to the Complicity of Queen Mary in the Murder of Darnley;&quot; and, in concert with his lifelong friend and companion, Norval Clyne, &quot;The Ecclesiastical and Baronial Antiquities of the Cathedral of Brechin and Castle of Edzell.&quot; An unpublished paper on Henry Scougal supplied materials for the &quot;Life&quot; of that author prefixed to the latest edition of Scougal&#x27;s devotional treatise, &quot;The Life of God in the Soul of Man&quot; (Aberdeen, 1892).

==Family==
His wife, Ann Lyall, died many years before him, leaving him two sons, the Rev. George Grub, provost of St Ninian&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth, and the Rev. Charles Grub, rector of St Mary&#x27;s, Montrose.

==Works==
His &quot;Ecclesiastical History of Scotland&quot; (1861), written from the standpoint of an Episcopalian, is dry, but concise, clear, fair-minded, and trustworthy. Grub also edited (along with Joseph Robertson) Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Scots Affairs&quot; for the Spalding Club, of which he was one of the founders.

<text>Foz do Iguaçu (; &quot;Iguazu River mouth&quot;), colloquially referred to as Foz, is the Brazilian city on the border of Iguaçu Falls. Foz in Portuguese means the mouth or end of a river and Iguaçu in Guarani or Tupi comes from the words &quot;y&quot; , meaning &quot;water&quot; or &quot;river&quot;, and &quot;guasu&quot; , meaning &quot;big&quot;. 

The city is the 7th largest in the state of Paraná with a population of approximately 258,000 inhabitants. It is approximately 650 km (400 mi) west of the capital of the state, Curitiba, being the westernmost city in that State.

The inhabitants of the city are known as &quot;iguaçuenses&quot;. The Iguaçu Falls located on the border of Argentina and Brazil and consisting of approximately 257 individual waterfalls over were chosen as one of the &quot;&quot;New Natural Seven Wonders of the World&quot;.&quot;

The city is characterized by tourism and cultural diversity. There are about 80 nationalities, being the most representative from Italy, Portugal, Lebanon, China, Paraguay and Argentina. Foz do Iguaçu is integrated into a tri-national region, bordering the Argentine city of Puerto Iguazú and the Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este. The city&#x27;s economy is based on tourism, with emphasis on trade and services.

According to research conducted by the Brazilian Tourist Institute (Embratur) and the Foundation Institute of Economic Research (FIFE) in 2006, 2007 and 2008, Foz do Iguaçu was the 2nd most visited leisure destination by foreign tourists after Rio de Janeiro. In 2010, it received from the Brazilian Ministry of Tourism 10 awards for Best Practices and Competitiveness Index. Foz do Iguaçu has been noted as a destination by various national and international media: the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered it the best foreign destination for the UK. The U.S. TV network CNN classified it as one of the 14 most romantic destinations.

Foz do Iguaçu is home of the Itaipu Dam, the world&#x27;s second largest hydroelectric plant in power generation, after the Three Gorges Dam in China. With 20 generator units and 14,000 MW of installed capacity, it provides approximately 15% of the energy consumed in Brazil and 86% of the energy consumed in Paraguay.
The city has a low crime rate by Brazilian standards.

==Geography==

===Climate===

The climate of Foz do Iguaçu is humid subtropical, with two distinctive seasons; one humid and hot in the summer and another, dry and cold, in the winter. The city&#x27;s annual average temperature is 23.8 °C (74.8 °F), but can be as high as 40 °C (104 °F) in the summer (highest) or as low as -5 °C (23 °F) in the winter (lowest). The average in the summer is 26.5 °C (79.7 °F)and in the winter 15.4 °C (59.6 °F).

The climate of the city is hot or warm throughout the year, due to the relatively low altitude (standing only 173 m, , above sea level).

Generally, the city is sunny during the year, but rain is fairly common during the spring and in the summer. The weather of the city, however, changes very constantly, because the region where the city stands is the zone where frequently three fronts meet. As consequence, it is not uncommon to see temperatures as high as 35 °C (95 °F) and in the summer as low as 8 °C (46 °F) in the city and frequent thunderstorms.

== History ==

In 1549, a Spanish explorer, Cabeza de Vaca, found the falls while travelling down the river. Very impressed, he named them &quot;Quedas de Santa Maria&quot;. Later the name changed to &quot;Quedas del Iguazú&quot;; which was derived from the native name of the local Guarani Indians.

Until 1860, it was under the disputed territory between Brazil and Paraguay, but given the latter&#x27;s defeat in the Paraguayan War, the falls were recognized as part of the Brazilian territory.

In 1910, the colony&#x27;s status was upgraded to the position of &quot;vila&quot; (town or village), named &quot;Vila Iguazú&quot;, and, in 1914, to city. At that time, the city was known as Foz do Iguassú.
In 1916, Alberto Santos-Dumont visited the region and, impressed with the beauty of the region, suggested more attention of the government to the area and asked for the appropriation of the land where currently is the Parque do Iguaçu (Iguaçu Park). Until 1917, this region had an owner, Jezus Val. The state appropriated the land in the next year, and, in 1939, the Parque Nacional do Iguaçu (&quot;Iguaçu National Park&quot;) was created.

The city experienced a big economical boom in the 1960s to the late 1980s, first with the construction of the Friendship Bridge, concluded in 1965, and the Itaipu Dam, in operation since in 1984.

=== Spelling of the name ===
In 1945, an agreement between the Brazilian Academy of Letters and the Academy of Lisbon changed the spelling of the city name to Foz do Iguaçu. 

On 19 October 2005, a proposal was made to revert the spelling of the city name to Foz do Iguassú. The proposal was approved in a first debate at the Town Hall and then rejected in a second debate, by four votes for and eight against.

The purpose of the adjustment to the city name was to return the spelling to the original form, as at the foundation of the city in 1914. The change occurred due language reforms of 1945, which changed the orthography of Brazilian Portuguese. However, existing proper names were not obliged to change. Another reason for the proposed adjustment back to the original was that 146 of the 198 member countries of the United Nations do not have the &quot;ç&quot; character in their alphabets.

The adjustment would therefore rationalise any search for the city in search engines, since Foz do Iguaçu&#x27;s is more widely known for the falls, which are known as the Iguassú Falls. The City councillor proponent of the bill, Djalma Pastorello, felt that tourism to the city of Foz do Iguaçu would improve greatly by a clarification of its association with the now-famous Iguassu Falls. However, he estimated that 70% of the city&#x27;s population were against the name change because the local media anticipated the change and presented it in a distorted way, so that locals were unable to see that the intention was to benefit the population.

The same word is spelled Iguazú in Spanish and Yguasu in Guarani.

===Literature===
The region that today is part of Foz do Iguaçu, is described by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in his diary that narrates the very experience at the beginning of the European colonization in the Americas. In contemporary literature one of the city&#x27;s neighborhoods appears in a subjective way in the work of the writer Leonid R. Bózio, who reports in the book &quot;Tempos Sombrios&quot;, from the series &quot;Autofagia&quot;, local mysticism through the figure of &quot;Pombero&quot;, a creature from Guarani mythology.

==Demographics==

The city has a population of approximately 265,000, whilst the Triple Frontier region (the metropolitan areas of Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil; Ciudad del Este, Paraguay; and Puerto Iguazú, Argentina) has a population of close to 1 million. The city&#x27;s population is heterogeneous, with immigrant communities from many parts of the world, such as Arabs (mostly from Lebanon or Syria), Asians (mostly of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean descent), Europeans (mostly Germans, Italians, French, Swedes, Portuguese, Poles, and Ukrainians), and other Central and South Americans (mostly Paraguayans and Argentines with some Haitians, with UNILA attracting students from all over the Americas).

The residents are predominantly Roman Catholic but there is a relatively large minority of Muslims and Buddhists. The city has a large mosque and a Buddhist temple.

Fenartec is an annual event held in May to commemorate the city&#x27;s multicultural diversity.

===Arab influence===
Since 1940, Lebanese and other Arabs have settled in the southwestern city of Foz do Iguaçu, in the &quot;Triple Border&quot; area where Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil converge in a region of loosely controlled borders.

People of Lebanese heritage constitute around 90% of the population from Middle East in the city, with others from Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Syria and Palestine.

== Transportation ==

Foz do Iguaçu is connected to the east by the BR-277, to Paranaguá, and to the west by the Friendship Bridge to Ciudad del Este, and to the south to Puerto Iguazú by the Fraternity Bridge. Both the BR-277 and the Friendship Bridge are very busy roads, linking Paraguay to the Paranaguá&#x27;s seaport.

The city is served by Foz do Iguaçu/Cataratas International Airport. Nearby options are Cataratas del Iguazú International Airport in Puerto Iguazú, Argentina and Guaraní International Airport in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay.

=== Public transport ===
The city does not operate its own municipal transport networks, but instead licenses four private bus companies to operate services on its behalf. The bus fares are set by the municipality for all four companies. In 2003, the city initiated an integrated city fare and created a hub near the city centre.

Now, most of the bus routes pass through this hub and passengers pay a standard fare within the city zone, which enables them to transfer routes, even when these may be operated by another company.

The transport network extends to certain distant areas, such as the city&#x27;s airport and the Iguazu Park, but not between the city and its neighbor Ciudad del Este, nor with Puerto Iguazú, which are serviced by other companies. These routes are not part of the integrated network, a situation reflected by higher fares.

=== Avenida Brasil (Brazil Avenue) ===
Since Foz do Iguaçu&#x27;s foundation, Brazil Avenue is the city&#x27;s main road. While during its early years the street was primarily the military headquarters&#x27; location (now they are just in the right beginning of the Avenue), nowadays the street is a very active place where many retail stores are located. It is located at the downtown of the city and it is 5 km (3 mi) long (of which 3 km, , is arterial road).

As of 2004, the prefecture of the city decided that a major revitalization of &quot;Avenida Brasil&quot; (Brazil Avenue) was needed. Attracting many consumers from many different areas of the city and even from its neighbours Ciudad del Este and Puerto Iguazú, the avenue, wide enough only to support two cars side-by-side, is frequently used during business days, and even more in important holidays (Christmas, Children&#x27;s day, Easter, Mother&#x27;s day), with many cars competing for a parking space.

The revitalization proposals asks for removal of parking space, giving major attention to pedestrians. Also, the avenue would be wide enough only to support one car side by side. The project started at the end of 2004, and by 2006 was completed. The avenue does not have a bus route, by municipal order.
==Education==
The city has a literacy rate of 95.5%, with most children attending public or private schools. Public education has been a priority of the municipality of the city and the government of the state of Paraná; however, most middle and upper-class families continue to send their children to elite private schools.

The city has approximately 30 private schools and approximately 120 public schools (including daycare and kindergarten schools). In addition, there are 7 universities: 
*Cesufoz; 
*UDC;
*Uniamérica;
*Unifoz; 
*Unioeste; 
*Anglo-Americano Faculdades;
*IFPR (Technical Institute).

In January 2010, the Universidade Federal da Integração Latino-Americana (UNILA) was founded.

==Tourism==
The city is one of Brazil&#x27;s most-frequented tourist destinations. Most tourists are Brazilians and Argentines. The city has about 100 hotels and inns. Its main attractions are:

*Iguaçu Falls, which has a flow capacity equal to three times that of Niagara Falls. Part of the falls are on the Brazilian side. Others are on the Argentine side. &quot;Devil&#x27;s Throat&quot; (&quot;Garganta do Diabo&quot; in Portuguese) is the tallest of the falls, which is 97 m (318 ft) high;
*Parque Nacional do Iguaçu (Iguaçu National Park), in both Brazil and Argentina, where the falls are. It is protected by the IBAMA. Attractions include also Macuco Safari river rafting and Poço Preto Hike;
*Itaipu Dam, the first-largest generator of hydro-electric power in the world, in the Parana river, between Brazil and Paraguay. Both the plant and the Biological Reserve can be visited;
*The &quot;Tríplice Fronteira&quot; (Triple Frontier) location where Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay meet. Each side has its own &quot;Marco&quot; (landmark);
*The Omar Ibn Al-Khattab mosque, the largest in Latin America;
*The Bird Park (Parque das Aves), which features a collection of wild birds, and the &quot;Bosque Guaraní&quot; the city&#x27;s zoo.

<text>Thomas Guthrie FRSE (12 July 1803 – 24 February 1873) was a Scottish divine and philanthropist, born at Brechin in Angus (at that time also called Forfarshire). He was one of the most popular preachers of his day in Scotland, and was associated with many forms of philanthropy—especially temperance and Ragged Schools, of which he was a founder.

==Life==


He was born on 12 July 1803 the son of David Guthrie, a banker, and later Provost of Brechin. Thomas grew to a height of six foot and three inches.

Guthrie studied at Edinburgh University for both surgery and anatomy (under Dr Robert Knox) but then concentrated on Theology. He was licensed to preach in the Church of Scotland from 1825, but having established a reputation as an evangelical he had difficulty securing a parish and instead spent two years studying medicine and science in Paris. Following his return from Paris and a period of varied employment, including as a bank manager, he was eventually offered the living of Arbirlot in Angus by the Hon William Maule in 1830. Guthrie served as Minister of Arbirlot for eight years, and while there where he adopted a dramatic style of preaching suited to his rural congregation. As well as his training for the Ministry, his medical knowledge and experience was called upon in particular during an outbreak of cholera in the parish.

In 1837 Guthrie was called to the second charge of Old Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh, alongside first charge minister Rev John Sym. Edinburgh Town Council discontinued the second charge at Old Greyfriars in October 1840 and instead created a new parish called St John&#x27;s. A new church was built on Victoria Street to serve this role with Guthrie as its first minister.

Guthrie left the Church of Scotland in the Disruption of 1843 and many of his congregation followed him. They worshipped for 2 years in the Methodist Hall in Nicholson Square before moving into the purpose-built Free St John&#x27;s, Johnston Terrace (now St Columba&#x27;s Free Church) in 1845. Possessed of a commanding presence and voice, and a remarkably effective and picturesque style of oratory, he became perhaps the most popular preacher of his day in Scotland, and was associated with many forms of philanthropy, especially temperance and ragged schools, of which he was a founder; he first publicizing the idea in his &quot;Plea for Ragged Schools&quot; in 1847. His hard work as a proponent and founder of the Ragged Schools movement led him to be quoted by Samuel Smiles in his &quot;Self Help&quot;. The first ragged school was soon opened on Castle Hill, Edinburgh.

He was one of the leaders of the Free Church of Scotland, and raised over £116,000 for the Manse Fund for its ministers. Guthrie expressed serious concern that the Manse Fund would stretch the generosity of Free Church people to the limit but his fears were unfounded. After Guthrie had toured 13 Synods and 58 Presbyteries in less than a year, he was able to announce to the General Assembly of June 1846 that £116,370 had been raised. It is unlikely that anyone else could have achieved what he did in such a short space of time. His energy and oratory enabled the Manse Fund to smash its original target. Numerous ministers and their families owed a huge debt of gratitude to Guthrie for providing the resources to build manses so that the gospel could continue to prosper not just in the Highlands but across the whole of Scotland. Along with his Ragged Schools the Manse Fund was one of Guthrie&#x27;s greatest legacies. With the one he showed mercy to helpless children and with the other he fought oppression by raising funds for manses.

He was made Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland in 1862. He was succeeded in 1863 by Rev Roderick McLeod. Other roles included manager of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, work for the Blind Asylum and work at the Night Refuge. In 1847 the degree of D.D. was conferred on him by the University of Edinburgh.

Dr Guthrie&#x27;s most enduring legacy was the Ragged Schools which had a unique curriculum; education, regular meals, clothes, &quot;industrial training&quot; and Christian instruction. Most of the ragged children who attended the schools did not remain overnight but were in school for 12 hours in the summer and 11 hours in the winter. The day started at 8 am with the rather painful sounding &#x27;ablutions&#x27; and the children were dismissed at 7:15 pm after supper. Guthrie describes the daily routine; &quot;in the morning they are to break their fast on a diet of the plainest fare, – then march from their meal to their books; in the afternoon they are again to be provided with a dinner of the cheapest kind, – then back again to school; from which after supper, they return not to the walls of an hospital, but to their own homes. There, carrying with them a holy lesson, they may prove Christian missionaries to those dwellings of darkness and sin&quot; Thomas Guthrie, Seed-Time and Harvest of Ragged Schools.

The unique curriculum of Ragged Schools was done in an environment of discipline and structure although there is never a sense that the schools were harsh or austere. Guthrie was no great fan of corporal punishment and instead encouraged staff to win over children with kindness; &quot;these Arabs of the city are wild as those of the desert, and must be broken into three habits, – those of discipline, learning and industry, not to speak of cleanliness. To accomplish this, our trust is in the almost omnipotent power of Christian kindness. Hard words and harder blows are thrown away here. With these alas they are too familiar at home, and have learned to be as indifferent to them as the smith&#x27;s dog to the shower of sparks&quot; Thomas Guthrie, Seed-Time and Harvest of Ragged Schools. While Guthrie&#x27;s management of the Ragged Schools was never sectarian or denominational he never compromised on Christian education. Perhaps one of his best quotes about the Ragged Schools sums up this view; &quot;the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible; the Bible without note or comment – without the authoritative interpretation of priest or presbyter – as the foundation of all its religious teaching, and of its religious teaching to all&quot;. It was, however, through objections to the religious part of the curriculum that those who differed from Guthrie on the issue later founded the United Industrial School, giving combined secular and separate religious instruction.

Guthrie himself saw the Ragged Schools as his most enduring legacy; &quot;I never engaged in a cause, as a man and a Christian minister that I believe on my death-bed I will look back on with more pleasure or gratitude to God, than that he led me to work for Ragged Schools. I have the satisfaction, when I lay my head upon my pillow, of always finding one soft part of it: and that is, that God has made me an instrument in His hand of saving many a poor creature from a life of misery and crime&quot; Thomas Guthrie and Sons, Autobiography and Memoirs (London, 1896, p 496). Guthrie’s legacy of Ragged Schools did more than almost any social philanthropist in history to change the nation of Scotland. Amongst Guthrie’s last words he was overheard to say &quot;a brand plucked from the burning!&quot; His legacy was that through his vision and love for his Saviour, the Ragged School movement was established which in turn plucked thousands of little brands from a life of poverty and crime, and brought them to know the ultimate friend of sinners.

As well as Ragged Schools Guthrie was also well known for his work as a temperance campaigner, although he did not become a total abstainer himself until the age of 38. While he was always against drunkenness it was an experience while over in Ireland that turned him away from drink altogether. While travelling with a ministerial friend in 1841 they stopped at a small county inn on a terrible cold night. Seeking some warmth and comfort they ordered some ‘toddies’ (whiskey and hot water). Out of kindness they called in their driver and offered him the same hospitality. Guthrie was stunned when this staunch, but uneducated and uncultured, Roman Catholic explained that he was a teetotaller and would not touch a drop of alcohol. From that day forward Guthrie resolved to abstain from alcohol and became one of the leaders of the temperance movement.

The determination with which Guthrie pursued the temperance cause was all the more remarkable when we understand how unusual this position was in the first half of the 19th century. In his autobiography he reckons that when he was at Edinburgh University there was not a single student who was an abstainer. Perhaps even more remarkably Guthrie was unaware of any minister in the Church of Scotland who was a teetotaller. Undeterred by this, Guthrie established the Free Church Temperance Society along with Horatius Bonar and William Chalmers Burns. When the ‘Scottish Association for the Suppression of Drunkenness’ was formed in 1850 they turned to Guthrie to write their first booklet entitled ‘A Plea on behalf of Drunkards and against Drunkenness’. Other booklets followed and Guthrie was instrumental in bringing about the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1853 or the ‘Forbes Mackenzie Act’, as it is better known. This Act forced public houses to close at 10.00 pm on weekdays and all day on Sundays. Even today it is still illegal to buy alcohol after 10.00 pm in shops, although this is not so in Public Houses.

Guthrie’s work on total abstinence reached its climax with preaching a series of sermons on Luke 19 v 41 and their publication under the title, &#x27;The City, Its Sins and Sorrows’ in 1857. The stories of the impact that these sermons had around the world are many and varied but space allows us to mention only one of them. One of Guthrie’s later biographers, Oliphant Smeaton, recounts meeting a wealthy Scot while visiting Australia. This man, while resident in Scotland, had lived a dissolute lifestyle but one day found himself wandering in to St John’s Free Church. Listening to the powerful oratory of Guthrie as he preached on Christ weeping over Jerusalem, the man left affected but unchanged. All week he tried to kill his conscience through plunging headlong into drunkenness.

The following Sunday he was drawn back to hear Guthrie again despite being under the influence of drink. The great orator did not disappoint. Toward the end of his sermon he leaned his huge frame over the pulpit and said with great feeling: &quot;There are few families among us so happy as not to have had some one near and dear to them either in imminent peril hanging over the precipice, or the slave of intemperance altogether sold under sin.&quot; The hearer could contain his emotions no longer and left a broken man. The following day he sought out Dr Guthrie and was dealt with &quot;fatherly kindness.&quot; He continues: &quot;when he had knelt with me at the throne of grace, and offered up a prayer, the like of which I never heard before or since, he bade me farewell, inviting me to return and see him: but I never did so&quot;. Within weeks the man was on a ship to Australia where he became a wealthy businessman and generous contributor to charity work.

Among his writings are &quot;The Gospel in Ezekiel&quot; (1855) and &quot;Plea for Ragged Schools&quot; (1847), and &quot;The City, its Sins and Sorrows&quot; (1857), &quot;Christ and the Inheritance of the Saints&quot; (1858), &quot;The Way to Life&quot;, Speaking to the Heart&quot;, the &quot;Life of Robert Flockhart&quot;, &quot;Man and the Gospel&quot; (1865), &quot;The Angels Song&quot; (1865), &quot;The Parables&quot; (1866), &quot;Our Fathers Business&quot; (1867), &quot;Out of Harness&quot; (1867), &quot;Early Piety&quot; (1869), &quot;Studies of Character&quot; (1868–70) and &quot;Sundays Abroad&quot; (1871), &quot;The Sunday Magazine&quot;

:&quot;Born at Brechin, Forfarshire. Minister successively of Arbirlot and of Old Greyfriars and St John&#x27;s parish churches and of Free St John&#x27;s Church in this city.&quot;

Thomas Guthrie died at St Leonards-on-Sea in Sussex in 1873 and was buried in The Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh. His grave is in a commanding position, terminating the main central avenue at its southern end. His will left his copy of the National Covenant to the Free Church.

His wife, Anne Burns (1810–1899), daughter of Rev James Burns of Brechin, is buried with him.

==Memorials==
Tributes in memory of him include the following:
* A statue of him, in Portland stone, stands on Princes Street in Edinburgh, facing Castle Street. It was executed by the sculptor F. W. Pomeroy, and erected in 1910. Reading - &quot;An eloquent preacher of the gospel. Founder of the Edinburgh Original Ragged Industrial Schools, and by tongue and pen, the apostle of the movement elsewhere. One of the earliest temperance reformers. A friend of the poor and of the oppressed.&quot;
* A large marble bust of him, by the main entrance of Free St Columba&#x27;s (formerly Free St John&#x27;s), has been erected to his memory shortly after his death in 1873. This bust was duly removed by the United Free Church congregation, who re-erected it in Martyrs and St John&#x27;s Church on George IV Bridge. There it remained — once misleadingly proclaiming Guthrie to have been &#x27;the first minister of this church&#x27; — until the dissolution of the congregation in 1973, when it was offered back to, and gratefully accepted by, the Deacons&#x27; Court of Free St Columba&#x27;s.
* A plaque on the south wall of St. Giles Cathedral, executed by Pilkington Jackson
* A plaque in the former Thomas Guthrie School in Liberton (now converted to flats and named &quot;Smiddy Wynd&quot;)
* A memorial in Brechin Cathedral (to him, and to his wife)
* A sandstone bust is incorporated into the front wall of a house (now Creag Dhubh guesthouse) in Inveraray commemorating his stay in the house during the summer if 1866

==Family and Descendants==

He was married to Anne Burns, daughter of Rev James Burns, minister of Brechin Cathedral.

Thomas Guthrie was father of Lord Guthrie and great-grandfather of Tyrone Guthrie (1900–1971), a theatre director in Britain, Canada and Ireland and John Guthrie Ward (1909-1991), a diplomat who became British Ambassador to Argentina (1957-1961) and Italy (1962-1966).

<text>Fordson was a brand name of tractors and trucks. It was used on a range of mass-produced general-purpose tractors manufactured by Henry Ford &amp; Son Inc from 1917 to 1920, by Ford Motor Company (U.S.) and Ford Motor Company Ltd (U.K.) from 1920 to 1928, and by Ford Motor Company Ltd (U.K.) alone from 1929 to 1964. The latter (Ford of Britain) also later built trucks and vans under the Fordson brand.

After 1964, the Fordson name was dropped and all Ford tractors were simply badged as Fords in both the UK and the US.

==Production years==
Between 1917 and 1922, the Fordson design for tractors was somewhat like the Ford Model T was for automobiles—it captured the public&#x27;s imagination and widely popularized the machine, with a reliable design, a low price affordable for workers and farmers, a widespread dealership network, and a production capacity for large numbers. Just as the Ford Model T helped the public to appreciate how soon cars and trucks might replace most horses in transport, the Fordson helped people to appreciate how soon tractors might replace most horses in farming (advancing the mechanization of agriculture). As with cars, Ford never had the market to itself but it dominated the market for a time; for tractors, from roughly 1917 to 1925, and again from 1946 to 1953. Ford was the only automotive firm to sell cars, trucks, and tractors simultaneously from 1917 to 1928.

For a decade between 1928 and 1939, Ford of the U.S. left the tractor business. During that decade, Ford of Britain continued to build Ford and develop new variants, which it exported widely. In 1939 Ford of the U.S. reentered the tractor market with an all-new model, this time with the Ford brand. Ford of Britain continued to use the Fordson brand until 1964.

Fordson production took place in the U.S. (1917–1928); Cork, Ireland (1919–1923 and 1928–1933); and at Dagenham, Essex, England (1933–1964). Tens of thousands of Fordsons, most from the U.S. and some from Ireland, were exported to the Soviet Union from 1920 to 1927. Soviet Fordson clones were also built at Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) from 1924 and at Stalingrad (now Volgograd) from 1930.

==Tractors==
===Ford experimental tractor development, 1907–1916===
Henry Ford grew up in an extended family of farmers in Wayne County a few miles from Detroit, Michigan in the late 19th century. At the time, farm work was extremely arduous, because, on the typical farm, virtually nothing could get done without manual labor or animal labor as the motive power. As his interest in automobiles grew, he also expressed a desire to &quot;lift the burden of farming from flesh and blood and place it on steel and motors.&quot; In the early 20th century, he began to build experimental tractors from automobile components. Four years after founding the Ford Motor Company in 1903, Ford finished his first experimental tractor in 1907 on Woodward Avenue in Detroit, referring to it as the &quot;Automobile Plow&quot;. Approximately 600 gasoline-powered tractors were in use on American farms in 1908. Fordson tractor design was headed by Eugene Farkas and József Galamb, who had previously been involved in the design of the legendary Ford Model T.

Traction engines had been around for a while, but they were large, heavy, expensive machines suited to prairie grain farming more than to small family farms in other regions. In the early 1910s, North America and Europe were hungry for small, inexpensive tractors, and many people seized on the Model T as a platform with which to create them. The idea of an auto-like tractor, made using auto-like parts and methods or by conversion from autos, was ripe. American engineer, inventor, and businessman Henry Ford built experimental tractors from automobile components during the early 20th century and launched a prototype known as the Model B in August 1915. Further prototypes, with a dedicated tractor design, followed in 1916. With World War I raging in Europe, the first regular-production Henry Ford &amp; Son tractors were exported to the U.K. in 1917 to expand British agriculture. In 1918, exports continued, the tractors began to be labeled as Fordsons, and U.S. domestic sales began. Sales boomed in 1918 and 1919.

Henry Ford experimented with auto-plows and heavier tractors. In August 1915, at a plowing demonstration in Fremont, Nebraska, he introduced a newly designed tractor known as the Model B. It used a , two-cylinder, horizontally opposed engine, a spur gear transmission and three wheels—two front drivers and one rear steerer. The Model B was never produced but did gain enough publicity to let the world know Ford was interested in developing a tractor.

Knowing there was a demand for a Ford-built tractor, a group of entrepreneurs in Minneapolis organized The Ford Tractor Company, paying a company clerk surnamed Ford for the use of his name, to get sales and attention from the confusion of this &quot;Ford&quot; company with the well-known Ford Motor Company. The company built and sold some tractors, but anticipated a settlement with Henry Ford for permission to use their already-trademarked name. However, Ford thwarted them by using another name.

===Fordson origins, Model F, and Model N===


The prototypes of the new Henry Ford &amp; Son tractor, which would later be called the Fordson, were completed in 1916. World War I was raging in Europe, and the United Kingdom, a net importer of food, was desperate for tractors in its attempt to expand its agriculture enough to feed Britain despite the great shipping disruption of the war. In 1917, the British Ministry of Munitions selected the Fordson for both importation from the U.S. and domestic U.K. production. It was thought that domestic U.K. production was preferable because so much Atlantic shipping was being sunk that exporting tractors from the U.S. would be counterproductive, as many would be lost at sea. This was soon modified to exclude the London area because of concerns about its vulnerability to German attacks. Henry Ford decided to build the tractor at Cork, Ireland (which at the time was still part of the U.K.), partly because he wanted to bring jobs to, and foster industriousness in, southern Ireland. But the Cork plant did not begin production until 1919 after the war had ended. As events turned out, thousands of tractors were exported from the U.S. in 1917 and 1918.

The tractor used a , inline four-cylinder engine. The engine was similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects. Like many engines of its day, it was multifuel-capable; it was usually tuned for gasoline or kerosene, but alcohol could also be burned. (Tractor vaporizing oil [TVO] existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used. It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s.) Like many other multifuel machines, the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank (just a few quarts/litres) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently (no more than 5 minutes). To handle the kerosene (or, rarely, TVO), the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor. The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich, and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the inlet manifold. The intake system also had a water bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine (an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917). Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan, even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles (which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air). The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley. In later decades, the water bath would be replaced with an oil bath for better filtering performance.

The ignition system was similar to that of the Model T, with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and trembler coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed spur gear (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6 mph). A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element to the gear element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.

Ford engineer Eugene Farkas successfully made the engine block, oil pan, transmission, and rear axle stressed members constituting the frame. By eliminating the need for a heavy separate frame, costs were reduced and manufacturing was simplified. Ford held a patent on a unit-frame tractor. The rear wheels were fabricated steel, spoked and cleated. The earliest ones were 12-spoke; a 14-spoke version followed. Several models of the front wheel were used, including 10-spoked fabricated steel and 5-spoke cast iron. Industrial models also used other wheels designed for specific tasks, including aftermarket wheels.

In 1916 and 1917, the name &quot;Fordson&quot; was not yet used as the tractor&#x27;s make or model name, nor was &quot;Model F&quot;. During this period, terms such as &quot;the [real/genuine] Ford tractor&quot; or &quot;the Henry Ford tractor&quot;, as well as &quot;the MOM tractor&quot; (because almost all output was going to the British Ministry of Munitions), were used. &quot;The Ford Tractor Company&quot; had already been registered on March 15, 1915, by W. Baer Ewing and Paul W. Ford. In early 1918, the name &quot;Fordson&quot; was trademarked, and within a few months, it was being marked on the tractors. Published sources vary somewhat on the origin of the name. All agree that the name reflects the contemporary name of the tractor company, &quot;Henry Ford &amp; Son&quot;, and its obvious eponyms: Henry and Edsel. Some claim that the company had been using the cable address &quot;Fordson&quot; for several years, which would mean even before the company was officially incorporated in July 1917. Another implies that February 1918 marked the first use of &quot;Fordson&quot; in a cablegram. Regardless, by April 1918 the name &quot;Fordson&quot; was established as the brand, and its eponyms were obvious. In that month, U.S. sales began under County War Board distribution rules. The Model F designation (for essentially the same model, with improvements) began in 1919. Sales boomed in 1918 and 1919.

There was nothing about the Fordson&#x27;s design or farming capabilities that was a &quot;first-ever&quot; among tractors (Ford&#x27;s version of a unit frame was novel for tractors, but that didn&#x27;t give it special farming advantages). But it was the first tractor that combined all of the following factors: it was small, lightweight, mass-produced, and affordable; it had a large distribution network (dealers nearby in many locales); and it had a widely trusted brand (via Ford). Such factors made it possible for the average farmer to own a tractor for the first time. Thus Henry Ford and colleagues had done again, for the tractor, what they had recently done for the automobile with the Ford Model T. Ford incorporated his private company, Henry Ford and Son Inc, to mass-produce the tractor on July 27, 1917. The Fordson tractor went into mass production in 1917 and debuted for sale on October 8, 1917, for US$750.

At a hurriedly built factory in Dearborn, Michigan, he used the same assembly line techniques he used to mass-produce the Ford Model T. It took thirty hours and forty minutes to convert the raw materials into the 4,000 parts used for the tractor assembly. At this time, the Fordson sold for US$750; each cost $567.14 to manufacture (including labor, materials and overhead), leaving a profit of $182.86. Soon Dearborn was sending knock-down kits to final assembly plants in various U.S. states, including New Jersey, Iowa, and Missouri. The core of Fordson production later moved to the new Ford River Rouge Complex.

The Fordson succeeded in being cheaper to maintain than horses, as the Ford Model T had previously done. A government test concluded that farmers spent $.95 per acre plowing with a Fordson compared to feeding eight horses for a year and paying two drivers, which cost $1.46 per acre.

Despite several early design flaws and reliability issues such as engine failure and unbearable heat, the Fordson established a firm foothold on U.S. farms, with more than 70% market share in earlier years. By mid-1918, more than 6,000 Fordson tractors were in use in Britain, Canada, and the United States.

In the U.S., Ford established a policy in 1919 to loan Fordson tractors to educational institutions with vocational training programs. Agricultural colleges could use a Fordson for six months and then exchange it for a new one. Under this arrangement, forty-two tractors were loaned to such universities as Cornell, Idaho, Michigan, Maryland and Prairie View State Normal in Texas. Others went to the orphanage at Nacoochee Institute in Georgia, the Berry School at Rome, Georgia, and Camp Dix at Hutchinson, Kansas.

Annual production reached 36,781 in 1921 and 99,101 in 1926. By 1925, Ford had built its 500,000th Fordson tractor. Ford was the only automotive firm to sell cars, trucks, and tractors simultaneously from 1917 to 1928, during which time 552,799 Fordson tractors were built.

====Operation====
Like the Model T car, a Fordson tractor that was relatively new and well maintained would start easily in warm weather. Under such conditions, often a single crank pull would start it. However, in cold weather, starting could be difficult, especially once the machines were 10, 20, or 30 years old and worn out. In cold weather, the oil congealed on the cylinder walls and the clutch plates. The engine had to be hand cranked repeatedly with great effort. Strong men took turns cranking between intervals when individual ignition coils were adjusted. Sometimes farmers would build a fire under the tractor to warm up the crankcase and gearboxes to make it crank easier. The tractor, when in use, was fueled by kerosene, but gasoline was required to start it.

The Fordson could pull discs and plows that would require at least four mules to pull, and it could work all day long, provided the radiator was continually filled, the fuel replenished, and the water in the air filter tank changed. The carburetor air was filtered by bubbling it through a water tank. On dry days, the mud would build up in the water tank after a few of hours of operation. The mud would then have to be flushed out and the tank refilled.

==== Reliability and roll-overs ====

The Fordson Model F was not without flaws it shared with other brands. These problems included practical limits to traction, especially under muddy, snowy, or icy conditions, and the habit of rearing over backward if the plow encountered an obstruction. Many people complained that the traction would be better if the tractor were heavier, although Henry Ford always countered that merely adding weight was not a smart way to maximize traction.

Ford began shipping Fordson tractors to Ford Motor Company Limited in Britain in 1917 to meet an order from the British government for 5,000. Between the time the order was accepted and when production started, Ford overhauled the design to solve several problems. The car-type radiator was enlarged to capacity to cure overheating problems. The additional weight also helped hold the front down. In early Fordsons, the drive worm was located at the top under the driver&#x27;s seat. During heavy operation, the heat became unbearable to the operator. The drive worm was relocated to solve this problem and also allowed larger rear wheels which improved traction. Several changes were also made to simplify manufacture. The Fordson used the Model T coil magneto system; and water and oil pumps were eliminated in favor of the simpler thermosiphon cooling and splash lubrication.

Despite design and assembly improvements, Ford&#x27;s still required a high level of maintenance. A farmer near Atlanta in 1921 listed the cost of his Fordson repairs for the year as $1,246. He recorded problems in his diary, noting difficulty starting the engine, a broken wheel, engine failure, and the rear end bursting throughout January, totaling costs of $1,301 for 620 hours of work. A Colorado farmer telephoned his dealer three times a day to complain about his Fordson.

The most dangerous problem occurred when a towed implement became immovable: the stoppage of the implement would cause a reaction through the transmission that would flip the tractor over backward, sometimes killing the driver. This condition was caused by the low-geared worm drive, lightweight, and short length so there was an insufficient downward load to counter the reaction torque. The cause is sometimes said to have been introduced when the drive worm was relocated below the main drive pinion on the differential. However, the problem already existed, but was made worse by the higher differential position, which was accompanied by larger rear wheels, which required more torque to give the same drawbar force. One Indiana farmer believed the Fordson to be so dangerous that it should have been banned by law.

The &quot;Eastern Implement Dealer&quot; claimed that Fordsons killed 36 drivers in 1918. &quot;Pipp&#x27;s Weekly&quot; further claimed that Fordsons had killed 136 men up to August 1922. Ford spokesmen maintained the accidents resulted from inexperienced drivers, saying any tractor could be dangerous if improperly handled. Satisfied customers praised the Fordson, saying it made farm work easier and performed ideally in orchards and truck farms.

====Importation and production in Ireland, England, and the Soviet Union====

As described earlier, because the Fordson was born in 1916, its production site choices and export/import were shaped by the Allied war effort for World War I. Almost all of the first tractors went to the U.K. in 1917. In 1918 and 1919, sales spread to Canada and the U.S., and U.K. production began in pre-independence Ireland.

Ford signed a contract for a large consignment of Fordson tractors to the Soviet Union in 1919, which soon became the largest customer of the company. From 1921 until 1927, the Soviet Union imported over 25,000 Fordsons. These inexpensive and robust tractors became the major enticement for Soviet peasants towards collectivization and were often seen on Soviet posters and paintings during the era, such as in &quot;The First Tractor&quot;. As also happened with Ford cars and trucks imported in the early 1920s, the Soviets immediately began their domestic production of replacement parts and clones. In 1924, the Leningrad plant &quot;Red Putilovite&quot; (Красный Путиловец) started the production of Fordson-Putilovets tractors (Фордзон-путиловец). During the 1920s, the Soviet versions had a reputation for insufficient quality. Much of this was because the metallurgy and heat treatment were wrong. For example, no matter how perfectly one machines a shaft or gear, it will fail early if the hardness is wrong. As Soviet industrialization progressed in the 1930s, the worst of the quality problems were solved.

By mid-1918, more than 6,000 Fordson tractors, all U.S.-built, were in use in Britain, Canada, and the United States. After World War I ended, production began in Cork, Ireland, in parallel with U.S. production. Fordson tractors quickly shaped the U.S. tractor market and held over 70% of the market in earlier years.

Henry Ford had a power struggle with Ford Motor Company&#x27;s shareholders (including the Dodge Brothers, Horace and John Dodge) that culminated in 1919. He resigned from Ford Motor Company with the threat (fully realizable) to treat Henry Ford &amp; Son Inc as his new enterprise for all of his future cars, trucks, and tractors (he would begin with all-new designs), which would turn Ford Motor Company into a mere badly led competitor, destroying its stock&#x27;s value. This maneuver worked; Henry Ford bought out all the minority shareholders of Ford Motor Company in 1919, and then consolidated ownership in the Ford family: fifty-five percent in his name, forty-two percent in son Edsel&#x27;s name and the remaining three percent in wife Clara&#x27;s name. He merged Henry Ford &amp; Son into the Ford Motor Company in 1920.

Annual production reached 36,781 in 1921. The Fordson had established a firm foothold on U.S. farms.

In February 1922, after-sales had suffered from the depression of 1920–1921 and with stiffer competition from International Harvester, John Deere, J.I. Case, Allis-Chalmers, and others, Ford decided to reduce the price of the Model F from $625 to $395. This sparked a price war in the tractor industry known as the &quot;tractor wars&quot;. To compensate for the lower price, Ford had to cut costs and strive for larger-volume production.

Meanwhile, in Ireland, the Irish War of Independence occurred. Production at Cork never flourished during this first period, although a few thousand tractors a year were built. Ford ended production at Cork in 1922 and shipped the factory&#x27;s equipment back to the U.S. in 1923. (It would return some years later, as described below.)

By 1925, Ford had built its 500,000th Fordson tractor. Annual production reached 99,101 in 1926. By May 1927, total production figures had reached 650,000.

In February 1928, Ford surprised his U.S. market by ending U.S. Fordson production. Various reasons have been suggested. One was that IHC&#x27;s Farmall and other competitors had taken away the mystique of the Fordson in the U.S., and Henry Ford was not content to compete in the U.S. tractor market on a mere commodity basis; he wanted decisive competitive edges. Another is that he envisioned moving all production to Ireland and England because Europe, including Russia, was set to become the most important Fordson market. Henry Ford did not elaborate on his reasons.

Ford of England restarted Fordson manufacture at Cork, which involved a lot of work given that the factory had been disassembled in 1923. Ford Ltd bought much of the tooling from Ford of the U.S. From 1930, Fordson tractors were again sold in the United States, via imports from Cork; the Dagenham plant opened in 1933 and took over production from the Cork plant, which was again closed. George and Eber Sherman became the leading importers of English-built Fordsons.

After Cork became the sole production site in 1928, exports to the US were limited to 1,500 a month. This disrupted the business of countless firms, including Ford dealerships and aftermarket equipment makers (which was a large industry both for the Model T and the Fordson). Many of these firms formed a conglomerate called the United Tractor &amp; Equipment Corporation, which arranged a deal with Allis-Chalmers to build a substitute tractor. By 1933, the deal fell apart, as the Great Depression damaged the economy, and dealers and aftermarket builders could also import Cork-built Fordsons and, starting in 1933, Dagenham-built Fordsons. The United tractor became the Allis-Chalmers Model U.

Given Ford&#x27;s shutdown of U.S. Fordson production, the next big Soviet orders of American tractors via the Amtorg Trading Corporation went to IHC and others.

The Roaring Twenties had certainly been good for the Ford Motor Company. Even though Henry Ford had to deal with the disappointment of learning that the public would not forever adore and demand his original models of car, truck, and tractor (the Model T, Model TT, and Fordson), his new model of car and truck (Model A) was also very successful. Fordson&#x27;s success continued at Ford Ltd even though it came to an end in the U.S.

====Fordson Model N Standard====
The Fordson Model N replaced the Fordson Model F. It was an improved variant of the F. Production of the Model N started in Cork in 1927. Production of the Fordson Model N was transferred from Cork to Dagenham in 1933. The Model N featured a 27 HP engine, standard rear fenders (mudguards), a higher voltage ignition system, and optional pneumatic tires. In 1935 power take-off (PTO) was available as an option on the Model N.

The Fordson Model N was probably the most important tractor in the United Kingdom during World War II. The Dagenham plant produced over 136,000 Model N tractors during the war. Ford of the U.S. also exported Model 9N tractors to the U.K. during the war.

=== Later Fordson tractors (made in England) ===
====1930s experimentation at Dearborn====
After U.S. Fordson production ceased in 1928, Irish-built and later English-built Fordsons were imported to the U.S.; Eber Sherman was a principal importer.

The development of new Fordson/Ford tractors in the U.S. remained mostly inactive for about 10 years after the end of U.S. production, although Ford did experiment with several designs during the 1930s. Most of them never left the drawing board, which was intentional; Henry Ford was interested in continuing R&amp;D (and continued paying Ford engineers to work on it), although he wasn&#x27;t going to put any models into production until all conditions (design, market) were right for commercial success. A Fordson row-crop model, essentially a &quot;Fordson version of the Farmall&quot; with tricycle design and high clearance, was prototyped at Dearborn in 1930-1931 but waited until 1936 to be produced, when Ford Ltd of Britain produced it as the Fordson All-Around. (It was not without precedent, for the aftermarket had presaged it, although not with the high clearance; in 1939, Ford filed a patent for raising and lowering the clearance on the fly.) The idea of variable front track for row-crop tractors was also considered at Ford during this era. Achieving it via pivoting cantilevered wheel mounts was one of the options, although Ford never put that method into production (it later reached production in the form of the Avery Ro-Trak in 1938). The thought devoted to the topic paid off later, when the Ford 9N achieved it with another, simpler method. Between 1928 and 1932, Henry Ford&#x27;s attention became consumed mostly by the development and introduction of his company&#x27;s first V8 engine, which was introduced by Ford on March 31, 1932, and was an immediate success in Ford cars and trucks. Experimental V8-powered tractor prototypes were built, but no production occurred.

By the late 1930s, Henry Ford&#x27;s enthusiasm for reentering the tractor market was growing, but he still did not have a design or features that could ensure a runaway, market-changing success. His idea for a tractor with one large drive wheel was extensively developed, but the prototypes did not perform well. Various people who worked on it have wondered whether it was just a ruse to mislead Ford&#x27;s competitors about his real intentions for a coming model, but it seems that he was quite serious about it and was probably disappointed that it did not work out; if it had worked, it would have been a powerful fulfillment of his penchant for simplicity and very low cost.

His 1938 meeting with Harry Ferguson was the turning point that led to the next Ford tractor, the 9N. The Ferguson system—whose hitch we now call the three-point hitch, or three-point linkage (3PL)—gave Ford the kind of new and special feature that he was wishing to find—something to give a groundbreaking competitive advantage to any new Ford tractor entering the market. After the 1939 introduction of this new line of &quot;Ford&quot; tractors made in the U.S. (the Ford N-series tractors), there was very little importation of English Fordson models to the U.S.

====E27N====
The Fordson E27N Major was an upgrade to the Fordson N and was made in England from 
March 1945, having the same engine and transmission as the Model N, but in a new casting which allowed for a PTO and a hydraulic lift unit manufactured by either Smiths or Varley. The differential however was of a completely new design. For the first time, Fordson owners could purchase a tractor from the dealer fully equipped with 3PL, PTO, full electrics, and an adjustable-width front axle, allowing the tractor to work row crops. Available in many different versions, such as the crawler conversion made by County, and the half-tracked version by Roadless. From 1948 onwards the Perkins P6(TA) could be ordered fitted from the factory, giving the tractor a power unit, and improving on the design that was let down by the under-powered petrol/TVO engine. The E27N was a popular Machine with Australian farmers, setting the way for large sales of the New Major (E1A).

====E1A====
Post-war shortages delayed the development of an entirely new tractor. In 1952, the &quot;New Major&quot; entered production with a new Ford engine range. The 4D engine was designed and manufactured in the UK at Dagenham and was available as Diesel, Petrol, or Petrol/Kerosene. The tractor had a 6-speed modified version of the E27N transmission. The driver sat significantly lower, which led to the E27N being nicknamed the &#x27;High Major&#x27;. In 1958, the Power Major was introduced with and improved transmission and &#x27;live-drive&#x27; hydraulics, Then in 1960 the final version, the Super Major came out with a weight transfer system and differential lock. The Super Major was produced until 1964. These tractors were exported to the US—the first since 1939—badged as Fords.

====Dexta====
Meanwhile, a smaller new three-cylinder version which was named the Dexta had been launched to compete with the success of the Massey Ferguson 35, of which it shared the basic gearbox and differential casings as well as many other parts. The Dexta and later models MF35 (early models had a Standard 3-cylinder diesel engine) featured the Perkins A3 engine, with a few differences. The engine was at in early Dextas, whereas later machines and Perkins engined MF 35s had the version. The two tractors also had different injector systems and many further differences despite their common platform. The gasoline version of the Dexta had the same Standard engine as the Ferguson TEA and FE 35, one difference being that the starter was relocated to the right side of the Dexta. Unlike the Ferguson, the gasoline Dexta had the same gearbox castings as the diesel version.

===Aftermarket accessories and conversions===


Like Model T cars and trucks, the Fordson tractor provided the basis for a large and varied aftermarket in accessories and conversions. A pair of articles in a 1922 issue of the &quot;Chilton Tractor Journal&quot; describes the business environment and gives photographs of many of the attachments and conversions available. As with most other tractors, farmers and construction contractors could buy aftermarket governors, ignition parts, hitches, and drawbars; but with the Fordson especially, one could buy a crawler tractor, road grader, or self-propelled combine built by an aftermarket firm that used the Fordson essentially as a platform. For example, the original Gleaner self-propelled combines were built by attaching the combine to a Fordson. At least 3 companies offered crawler conversions, and others offered enlarged cleats, including the &quot;overgrown tire chain&quot; type that had led to crawler development not long before. Several companies converted Fordsons to road graders; the Wehr (video) is well remembered. The first tricycle cultivator version of the Fordson was available as an aftermarket conversion by the Moline Implement Company as early as 1920 or 1921, which was 3 to 4 years before the Farmall was introduced, a full decade before Dearborn prototyped the Fordson All-Around, and a full decade and a half before Ford Ltd produced that model. It lacked those tractors&#x27; high clearance but was otherwise prescient.

An economically significant concept is illustrated by kits such as the Dearborn Tractor Control. Its attachments let the person riding the towed implement control the tractor from the implement seat. Such a setup was offered for Fordson by at least three aftermarket suppliers. It was reminiscent of earlier mechanized efforts such as the Detroit Tractor, Moline Universal, and Allis-Chalmers Model 6-12 in that it represented the most literal kind of horse replacement (in some suppliers&#x27; cases, even retaining the reins as the control method). But besides providing mere comfort and familiarity for farmers accustomed to working with horses, it also neutralized an economic disadvantage of the tractors of the era. With horses, one person could control both the motive power and the implement, but with a tractor, two were required, because the tractor required a driver and the implement, in many cases, required an operator. Most implements of the era were legacy horse-drawn equipment (a fact that Harry Ferguson had to battle in trying to sell his system of tractor-specific implements during the 1920s and 1930s). Setups such as these cut back the man-hour requirement to match that of the horse—while the tractor&#x27;s high power and lack of daily, year-round feeding (&quot;eats only when it works&quot;) continued to beat the horse economically otherwise. The two-person requirement was often not a problem on farms that had large families; a son or daughter was usually available for duty. But the farm help problem was felt keenly on many other farms, especially during the world wars. Technological advancement eventually made it standard for one person to control both the tractor and implement, via the growing suite of hydraulic and electrical controls, especially after World War II.

In 1926 a corporation called Snow-Motors Inc demonstrated a Fordson Model F converted into a snowmobile, which they dubbed the Snow-Motor. The tractor used bullet-shaped screws instead of wheels or continuous track units to move across the snow. They were used (unsuccessfully) by Richard Byrd&#x27;s first Antarctic Expedition.

====Rail conversions====
To displace both horses and steam from remote logging railways (bush trams), several enterprising inventors took the Fordson tractor and made modifications to allow them to run on rails. Extra bogies (wheel sets) were added behind and in front of some versions and acted as log bogies, whilst increasing traction on the light rail lines, without increasing weight. Dunedin company Trails Ltd used the Fordson F as a base, adding a reverser, so the tractor could operate either way at the same speeds, and a powered bogie to act as a powered log bogie. Wellington company Nattrass advanced this design, and both companies&#x27; sales spelled the end of horse-operated bush trams in New Zealand. Nattrass also enjoyed sales in Australia. The last locomotive built by A &amp; G Price, a noted steam and diesel locomotive builder was completed in 1970 and used a Fordson Major E1 as a base.

== Other Ford tractors==
In the United States Ford reentered the tractor business in 1938 with the Ford N-series tractors. In 1953 this series was replaced by the Ford NAA tractors.

Starting around 1961, the U.S. tractor operations and the Ford Ltd U.K. tractor operations, which had been substantially independent although always in close communication, were reorganized into closer integration. After 1964, all tractors made by the Ford companies worldwide carried the Ford brand. In 1986, Ford expanded its tractor business when it purchased the Sperry-New Holland skid-steer loader and hay baler, hay tools and implement company from Sperry Corporation and formed Ford-New Holland which bought out Versatile tractors in 1988. In 1991 Ford sold its tractor division to Fiat with the agreement that they must stop using the Ford name by 2000. In 1999, Fiat removed all Ford identification from their blue tractors and renamed them &quot;New Holland&quot; tractors.

==Trucks==

The first heavy-duty 2-ton truck ever built by Fordson was introduced in 1926. While there are many similarities between the Ford Model T and the Fordson, there are also distinct differences. The truck included front-end gears and suspensions similar to the Model T, however, the rear suspension was, according to Ford, the most unique feature in that it consisted of two cantilever springs with feather-edge axles. The engine was unique in that it was positioned under the cab and was far back in the chassis, so the truck had a snub-nose appearance. There was only one 1926 Fordson truck to ever be delivered to a customer and it was listed for sale on Mecum Auctions in 2019.
The Fordson trucks were introduced as a brand in 1932 after the appearance of the Ford Model B engine and Ford Model BB chassis, although most models continued to be identified by the Ford brand. Production of a 2-ton truck began in 1934. The truck was powered by an 85 bhp V8 engine and was offered in the 4×2 version, as well as 6×2 and 6×4 factory conversions. In 1937, Ford Motor Company Ltd Dagenham announced a new design for the 2-ton and 3-ton trucks. The new design, offered with a 134-inch or a 157-inch wheelbase chassis, featured a new frontal appearance with a divided and slightly pointed windscreen. Other improvements were made to the engine, electrical system, and brakes. In 1939, Fordson Thames replaced the previous Fordson brand as to give it a more British identity.

The production of the Fordson truck range, which included models such as the Fordson Model 79, Fordson 7V, and Fordson WOT, started at the Ford facility in Dagenham where it continued until 1957 when the Fordson name was removed from the truck brand. 

Another manufacturing facility for Fordson trucks was located in Romania, where the Fordson 157 truck chassis was produced at the Hagelstein factory in Bucharest. The trucks were assembled at the Ford Româna S.A.R. facility in Floreasca.

<text>Alfred Matthew Hubbard (July 24, 1901 – August 31, 1982), was an early proponent for the drug LSD during the 1950s. He is reputed to have been the &quot;Johnny Appleseed of LSD&quot; and the first person to emphasize LSD&#x27;s potential as a visionary or transcendental drug.

==Career==
In 1920, Hubbard was publicized in West Coast newspapers as having developed a free energy motor, though a &quot;Popular Science&quot; article published in 1928 referred to it as a hoax. In 1929, he received for a radioactive &quot;Internal Combustion Engine Spark Plug&quot; device, which was manufactured sparingly by at least one U.S. company. It used an electrode doped with polonium 210, a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 138 days. The supposed &quot;ionizing effect&quot; of polonium 210 upon the combustion gases in the spark gap was purported to &quot;improve engine efficiency&quot;. According to local historian Brad Holden, Hubbard was an early prototype for the &quot;unconventional Seattle tech genius&quot;.

Motion was said to be among Hubbard&#x27;s passions. His identity as &quot;Captain&quot; came from his Master of Sea Vessels certification and a stint in the US Merchant Marine.

According to some accounts, Hubbard worked at various times for the Canadian Special Services, the United States Justice Department, the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and the Office of Strategic Services, or OSS (predecessor of the US Central Intelligence Agency).

As Hubbard told the story to Willis Harman (and Harman told it to Todd Brendan Fahey, a reporter for &quot;High Times&quot;), he was hiking in Washington State when an angel appeared to him in a clearing. &quot;She told Al that something tremendously important to the future of mankind would be coming soon, and he could play a role in it if he wanted to. But he hasn&#x27;t the faintest clue what he was supposed to be looking for.&quot;

Having read in a scientific journal about the then-obscure drug LSD-25, Hubbard felt this was something that he was destined to learn more about and to be involved with. Hubbard found a researcher who was conducting reported experiments on LSD with rats. He was able to obtain some LSD for himself. He believed in its utility for opening the human mind to deeper, broader vistas.

The confident and connected Al Hubbard invited Dr. Humphry Osmond to join him for lunch at the Vancouver Yacht Club. Osmond and his colleagues were using the drug, as well as the similar substance, mescaline, in psychiatric research and treatment at Weyburn, Saskatchewan. Osmond later recalled that the Yacht Club &quot;was a very dignified place, and I was rather awed by it. [Hubbard] was a powerfully-built man...with a broad face and a firm hand-grip. He was also very genial, an excellent host.&quot; &quot;Captain Hubbard&quot; was interested in acquiring some mescaline, which was then still legal, and Dr. Osmond supplied him with some.

By the time Timothy Leary and his colleagues were experimenting with psychedelic drugs in the psychology department of Harvard in the early 1960s, Hubbard had obtained a supply of Sandoz LSD. Hubbard went there to meet Leary and wanted to swap some LSD for some psilocybin, the synthesized constituent of magic mushrooms identified, and then produced, by Switzerland&#x27;s Sandoz Laboratories.

The Central Intelligence Agency grew out of the post-World War II OSS, which was reputed to be one of Hubbard&#x27;s employers. Under the auspices of MK-ULTRA, the CIA regularly dosed its agents and associates with powerful hallucinogens as a preemptive measure against what was alleged to be the Soviets&#x27; own chemical technology, sometimes with disastrous results. It is possible that Hubbard had some links with the CIA, but Humphry Osmond doubts that Hubbard would have been associated with a project like MK-ULTRA, &quot;not particularly on humanitarian grounds, but on the grounds that it was &quot;bad technique&quot;.&quot;

&quot;I was convinced that he was the man to bring LSD to planet Earth,&quot; remarked Myron Stolaroff, who was assistant to the president of long-range planning at electronics company Ampex Corporation when he met the Captain in the spring of 1956. Stolaroff learned of Hubbard through a mentor, philosopher Gerald Heard, a friend and spiritual mentor to Aldous Huxley.

According to Todd Brendan Fahey, Hubbard introduced more than 6,000 people to LSD, including scientists, politicians, intelligence officials, diplomats, and church figures.

<doc id="1078624" wikidata="Q1700348" url="?curid=1078624" title="John Hales (theologian)">
<text>John Hales (19 April 1584 – 19 May 1656) was an English cleric, theologian and writer. An eminent if modest author and critic, his posthumous works earned him the title of the &quot;Ever-memorable&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born in St. James&#x27; parish, Bath, on 19 April 1584. His father, John Hales, had an estate at Highchurch, near Bath, and was steward to the Horner family. After passing through the Bath grammar school, Hales went on 16 April 1597 as a scholar of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and graduated B.A. on 9 July 1603. He came to the notice of Sir Henry Savile, and was elected as a fellow of Merton College in 1605. He took orders; shone as a preacher, though not for his voice; and graduated M. A. on 20 June 1609. At Merton he distinguished himself as lecturer in Greek; he is said by Clarendon to have been largely responsible for Savile&#x27;s edition of Chrysostom (1610–13). In 1612 he became public lecturer on Greek to the university. Next year he delivered (29 March) a funeral oration on Sir Thomas Bodley. Soon after (24 May) he was admitted fellow of Eton College, of which Savile was Provost. He was Regius Professor of Greek in 1615.

==Synod of Dort==
In 1616 Hales went to the Netherlands as chaplain to the ambassador, Sir Dudley Carleton. Carleton sent him in 1618 to the Synod of Dort, as observer, and he remained there from 13 November till the following February. Then Walter Balcanquhall took over for him. Anthony Farindon states (as on Hales&#x27;s own authority) that Hales departed from Calvinism when Simon Episcopius pressed the verse St. John iii. 16 to support his own doctrine. According to Hales&#x27;s own letter (19 January 1619) it was Matthias Martinius of Bremen, who took a middle position, who employed this text. It is not clear that Hales became an Arminian, but in any case he came away less sectarian, and he was impressed by the debate on schism, which he reported on 1 December 1618.

==Later life==
Hales then refused all offers of ecclesiastical preferment, choosing instead a scholarly retirement in a Fellowship of Eton College, of which his friends Sir Henry Savile and Sir Henry Wotton were successively Provost. He lived much among his books, visiting London only once a year, although he was possibly there more frequently during the period (1633–43) of Lucius Cary&#x27;s connection with London.

In 1642, he was ejected from his stall as canon of Windsor by the parliamentary committee. He was not immediately turned out of his fellowship at Eton, but by 1644 both armies had battened onto the college rents. Hales hid himself for nine weeks in a private lodging in Eton, living on brown bread and beer at a cost of sixpence a week. On his refusal to take the engagement of 16 April 1649 he was formally dispossessed of his fellowship. Penwarden, who was put into his place, offered to share, but he declined. He went to Richings Lodge, near Colnbrook, Buckinghamshire, the residence of Anne Salter, second wife to Sir William Salter and sister to Brian Duppa, as tutor to her son William. To this house Henry King also retreated, with some members of his family, and they lived a sort of a collegiate life, with Hales acting as chaplain. After the order against harbouring malignants, he left Mrs. Salter against her wish, and lodged in Eton, selling his library.

Hales died at Eton on 19 May 1656.

==Biographers==
His life was to have been written by Farindon; but Farindon died before the issue of the &quot;Golden Remains&quot;, to which his contribution is a letter to Garthwait the publisher. It is said that John Pearson was asked to take up Farindon&#x27;s task; but he contented himself by prefixing to the &quot;Remains&quot; a few pages of eulogy. Farindon&#x27;s materials passed to William Fulman, who likewise failed to write the memoir. Use has been made of Fulman&#x27;s papers by John Walker and Chalmers.

John Aubrey, probably incorrectly, attributed to Hales the title &quot;the first Socinian in England&quot;, an epithet he had earlier, equally incorrectly, previously given to Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland.

==Works==

His reports to Carleton are included in his &quot;Golden Remains&quot;; an additional letter (11–22 December 1618) is given in Carleton&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot; (1757), and is in the 1765 edition of Hales&#x27;s &quot;Works.&quot;

===Main works===
On the appearance (in 1628 and 1633) of two anonymous eirenic and Socinian tracts, he was commonly but inaccurately accredited with their authorship. Hales wrote little for publication. His works are:
* &quot;Oratio Funebris habita in Collegio Mertonensi . . . quo die . . . Thomse Bodleio funus ducebatur&quot;, &amp;c., Oxford, 1613.
* &quot;A Sermon . . . concerning the Abuses of the obscure places of Holy Scripture&quot;, &amp;c., Oxford, 1617.
* The sermon &quot;Of Dealing with Erring Christians&quot;, preached at St. Paul&#x27;s Cross, seems also to have been printed, at Farindon&#x27;s instigation.
* The sermon &quot;Of Duels&quot;, preached at the Hague, is said to have been printed, though Farindon implies the contrary.

===Other works===
Other pieces, published during his lifetime, but apparently without his authority, were:
* &quot;The Way towards the Finding of a Decision of the Chief Controversie now debated concerning Church Government&quot;, &amp;c., 1641, anon.
* &quot;A Tract concerning Schisme and Schismatiques, ... by a learned and judicious divine&quot;, &amp;c., 1642; two London editions, same year, also one at Oxford, with animadversions.
* &quot;Of the Blasphemie against the Holy Ghost&quot;, &amp;c., 1646, anon.

===Posthumous===
* &quot;Golden Remains of the Ever Memorable Mr. John Hales&quot;, &amp;c., 1659; 2nd edit., with additions, 1673; 3rd edit.
* &quot;Sermons preached at Eton&quot;, &amp;c.
* &quot;Several Tracts&quot;, &amp;c., 1677; 2nd edit., 1716, with addition of the letter to Laud.

The &quot;Works . . . now first collected&quot;, &amp;c., were edited by Sir David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes, and printed at Glasgow by Foulis, 1765, in 3 vols.

Note:The eirenic tract on &quot;Schism and Schismatiques&quot; may have been written about 1636. Hales describes it as &#x27;a letter,&#x27; and &#x27;for the use of a private friend,&#x27; probably William Chillingworth, then working on his &quot;Religion of Protestants&quot; (1637). Those two works, with the &quot;Discourse of Infallibility&quot; (1645) of Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland, have been identified as key texts of the Great Tew Circle to which Hales belonged.

It was circulated in manuscript, and a copy fell into the hands of William Laud. Hearing that the paper had given offence to the archbishop, Hales wrote, and Laud interviewed him. Des Maizeaux mentions the story that Hales assisted Laud in the second edition (1639) of his &quot;Conference&quot; with John Percy. Laud made him one of his chaplains, and obtained for him a canonry at Windsor, into which he was installed on 27 June 1639.

<doc id="1078625" wikidata="Q280479" url="?curid=1078625" title="Basil Hall">
<text>Basil Hall (31 December 1788 – 11 September 1844) was a British naval officer from Scotland, a traveller, and an author. He was the second son of Sir James Hall, 4th Baronet, an eminent man of science.

==Early life==
Although his family home was at Dunglass, Haddingtonshire (now East Lothian), Basil Hall was born in George Square, Edinburgh, at his aunt&#x27;s house. He was educated at the Royal High School and joined the Royal Navy in 1802, being commissioned a Lieutenant in 1808, and later rising to the rank of captain.

Hall served aboard many vessels involved in exploration and scientific and diplomatic missions. From the beginning of his naval career he had been encouraged by his father to keep a journal, which later became the source for a series of books and publications describing his travels.
==Service in the Napoleonic Wars==
While serving aboard , Hall witnessed Sir John Moore being carried dying from the Battle of Corunna. It was also aboard the &quot;Endymion&quot; that Hall met William Howe De Lancey, who later married Hall&#x27;s sister Magdalene. De Lancey was struck by a cannonball at the Battle of Waterloo, and it was for her brother that Magdalene wrote &quot;A Week at Waterloo in 1815&quot;, a poignant narrative describing how she nursed him in his final days.
In 1810, he voyaged to Rockall aboard the &quot;Endymion&quot; and in 1811 was part of the first landing party there. His hazardous exploits in returning with this party were described in &quot;Fragments of Voyages and Travels&quot;, first published in 1831.
==Publication on the geology of the Cape of Good Hope==
In 1813, Hall published, along with Professor John Playfair a description of the granitic intrusions within the sedimentary sandstone structures that he saw in the Platteklip Gorge near the Table Mountain in the Cape of Good Hope. The phenomenon was re-examined at another location called as the Green Point Contact by Charles Darwin in 1836.
==Travels to Java, China, Korea, and the Ryukyu Islands==
Hall explored Java in 1813 and, as a part of a diplomatic mission to China under Lord Amherst in 1816 undertook surveys of the west coast of Korea and the outlying Ryukyu Islands. This resulted in his book &quot;Account of a Voyage of Discovery to the West Coast of Corea and the Great Loo-Choo Island in the Japan Sea&quot; (1818), which was one of the first descriptions of Korea by a European.

==Description of an 1815 shipwreck==
Hall&#x27;s journals also provide one of the few accounts of the wreck of the &quot;Arniston&quot; in 1815, which gave its name to the seaside town of Arniston, South Africa. As a captain, he was very critical of the fact that this ship did not have a marine chronometer with which to calculate longitude, and attributed the great loss of life directly to this false economy.
==Interviewing Napoleon==
In 1817 he also took the opportunity to interview Napoleon (who had been an acquaintance of his father) on St. Helena.
==Travels to Chile, Peru, and Mexico==
Hall took command of in May 1820 and in August he sailed her to the west coast of South America. He returned to England in spring 1823 and &quot;Conway&quot; was paid off. His journals of this period became the book, &quot;Extracts from a Journal Written on the Coasts of Chile, Peru and Mexico&quot; (1823).
==Marriage==
Following his retirement from the navy in 1823, Hall was married on 1 March 1825 to Margaret Congalton (d. 1876), the youngest daughter of Sir John Hunter, Consul-General in Spain, by his spouse Elizabeth Barbara, sister to Sir William Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet. Hall and Congalton also had a daughter, Eliza, who married Admiral William Charles Chamberlain.
==Travels to South Carolina and Georgia==
In 1826, when Sir Walter Scott was sunk in depression following his wife&#x27;s death and financial ruin, it was Hall who organised a trip to Naples for Scott, managing to persuade the government to place a ship at his disposal. In 1828 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician. Also that year, Hall and his wife embarked on a two-year tour of North America. In 1828, part of their route saw them travel over land from Charleston, South Carolina, then along the Savannah River by canoe from the ferry landing. They stayed at City Hotel in Savannah, Georgia, a city that Hall found &quot;showy&quot;. He &quot;liked the view of the city from the river, the plentiful trees, but did not approve of the wide streets that afforded so little shade&quot;.
==Publications about his travels==
In 1829 Hall published &quot;Travels in North America&quot;, which caused some offence due to his criticisms of American society. His best-known work was &quot;The Fragments of Voyages and Travels&quot; (9 volumes, 1831–1840), originally released as a three-yearly series of eight volumes each. He also contributed to the Encyclopædia Britannica and wrote scientific papers on subjects as varied as trade winds, the geology of Table Mountain and a comet he observed in Chile.
==Travels to Styria and influence on &quot;Carmilla&quot;==
In 1834, Hall apparently accepted an invitation from Jane Cranstoun, the Countess of Purgstall, to visit her estates in Styria, which she bequeathed two years later to the eminent historian and Orientalist, Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall. The result was &quot;Schloss Hainfeld; or, a Winter in Lower Styria&quot;, a Gothic travel account, which may have inspired Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Carmilla&quot;.

==Detention and death in a hospital==
Suffering from mental illness, Hall was detained in the Royal Hospital Haslar in Portsmouth, where he died in 1844, aged 55.

<text>Hiram Paulding (December 11, 1797 – October 20, 1878) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy, who served from the War of 1812 until after the Civil War.

==Naval career==
The son of John Paulding, Paulding was born in Cortlandt, New York. He was appointed Midshipman on September 1, 1811. During the War of 1812, he served on Lakes Ontario and Champlain, commanding the second division from during the Battle of Lake Champlain. After the war he served in , off the Algerian coast, and in , the brig , and .

On his return from service in &quot;Macedonian&quot; with the Pacific Squadron (1818–1821), he spent a year&#x27;s leave at Capt. Alden Partridge’s Military Academy (later Norwich University), Norwich, Vermont. In the ensuing years of the decade he served in on the West Indies station, and in on the Pacific station. While serving on the Paulding was chosen to carry Commodore Hull&#x27;s dispatches from Callao, Peru, to the mountain headquarters of General Simon Bolivar in the Andes; Paulding&#x27;s journey of 1,500 miles on horseback was later recorded in his book, Bolivar in His War Camp. The following year he volunteered to serve under John &quot;Roaring Jack&quot; Percival in the as that vessel pursued mutineers of the whaler &quot;Globe&quot;, then returned to &quot;United States&quot;. In 1830 he rejoined &quot;Constellation&quot; to serve as 1st Lieutenant, as she cruised the Mediterranean for two years, and in 1834 assumed command of the schooner for another Mediterranean tour. Appointed to command the sloop-of-war in 1838, he made a cruise in the West Indies and in 1841 became Executive Officer of the New York Navy Yard.
In 1844, Paulding was promoted to captain, and in 1845 he assumed command of for a three-year East Indian cruise and took command of that station with the departure of Commodore James Biddle for the United States. Between 1848 and 1852 he commanded in the Baltic, North, and Mediterranean Seas, then assumed command of the Washington Navy Yard.

Promoted to commodore, Paulding took command of the Home Squadron followed aboard the flagship . The squadron was instrumental in foiling the expedition against Nicaragua underway by the American William Walker, who had dreamed of uniting the nations of Central America into a vast military empire led by himself. Through insurrection, Walker became president of Nicaragua in 1856 when Costa Rica declared war to him. After his surrender to an allied Central American army and his return to the United States, Walker attempted for a military comeback when he was captured in 1857 by a landing of Home Squadron Marines. Stateside controversy over the questionable legality of seizing American nationals in foreign, neutral lands prompted President James Buchanan to relieve Paulding of his command, forcing him into retirement.

In 1861, Paulding was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to assist in building up a wartime fleet. He then took over the New York Navy Yard. Paulding was assigned to evacuate ships from the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, which the Confederates planned to seize, in April 1861. Paulding found that Charles Stewart McCauley, commander of the navy yard, had ordered destruction of the ships. Paulding had to complete the work of burning and scuttling the largest number of the ships. He was able to remove the USS &quot;Cumberland&quot;, towed by the USS &quot;Pawnee&quot;. The was burned to the waterline, but it was refitted latter as the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;. In August 1861, Paulding was named by Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles to the Ironclad Board, responsible for approving designs for and construction of ironclad warships. The result was the construction of , and (most famously) .

After the war Paulding served as governor of the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia and as post-admiral at Boston. Paulding died at Huntington, Long Island, New York, 20 October 1878. He published a &quot;Journal of a Cruise Among the Islands of the Pacific&quot; (1831).

<doc id="1078628" wikidata="Q562000" url="?curid=1078628" title="Anna Maria Hall">
<text>Anna Maria Hall (6 January 1800 – 30 January 1881) was an Irish novelist who often published as &quot;Mrs. S. C. Hall&quot;. She married Samuel Carter Hall, a writer on art, who described her in &quot;Retrospect of a Long Life, from 1815 to 1883&quot;. She was born Anna Maria Fielding in Dublin, but left Ireland for England at the age of 15.

==Life==
Hall was born in Dublin on 6 January 1800. She lived with her mother, a widow named Sarah Elizabeth Fielding, and stepfather, George Carr of Graigie, Wexford, until 1815. The daughter came to England with her mother in 1815. Anna Maria was educated in part by Frances Arabella Rowden, who was not only a poet, but, according to Mary Mitford, &quot;had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils&quot; This ties Anna Maria to other of Rowden&#x27;s pupils such as Rosina Doyle Wheeler, later Rosina Bulwer Lytton; Caroline Posonby, later Lady Caroline Lamb; the poet Letitia Elizabeth Landon (&quot;L.E.L.&quot;); and Emma Roberts, the travel writer.

On 20 September 1824, she married Samuel Carter Hall. Her mother lived with them in London until she died.

Mrs Hall&#x27;s first recorded contribution to literature is an Irish sketch called &quot;Master Ben&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The Spirit and Manners of the Age,&quot; January 1829, pp. 35–41 et seq. Other tales followed. Eventually they were collected into a volume entitled &quot;Sketches of Irish Character,&quot; 1829, and henceforth she became an author by profession. Next year she issued a little volume for children, &quot;Chronicles of a School-Room,&quot; consisting of a series of simple tales.

In 1831, Hall published a second series of &#x27;Sketches of Irish Character&#x27; fully equal to the first, which was well received. The first of her nine novels, &quot;The Buccaneer,&quot; 1832, is a story of the time of the Protectorate, and Oliver Cromwell is among the characters. To the &quot;New Monthly Magazine,&quot; which her husband was editing, she contributed &quot;Lights and Shadows of Irish Life,&quot; articles which were republished in three volumes in 1838. The principal tale in this collection, &quot;The Groves of Blarney&quot;, was dramatised with considerable success by the author, with the object of supplying a character for Tyrone Power, and ran for a whole season at the Adelphi in 1838. Hall also wrote &quot;The French Refugee&quot;, produced at the St. James&#x27;s Theatre in 1836, where it ran 90 nights, and for the same theatre &quot;Mabel&#x27;s Curse&quot;, in which John Pritt Harley played the leading part.

Another of her dramas, of which she had neglected to keep a copy, was &quot;Who&#x27;s Who?&quot; which was in the possession of Tyrone Power when he was lost in the SS &quot;President&quot; in April 1841. In 1840, she issued what has been called the best of her novels, &quot;Marian, or a Young Maid&#x27;s Fortunes&quot;, in which her knowledge of Irish character is again displayed in a style equal to anything written by Maria Edgeworth. Her next work was a series of &quot;Stories of the Irish Peasantry&quot;, contributed to &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Edinburgh Journal,&quot; and afterwards published in a collected form. In 1840 she aided her husband in a book chiefly composed by him, &quot;Ireland, its Scenery, Characters, &amp;c.&quot; She edited the &quot;St. James&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1862–63.
In &quot;The Art Journal&quot;, edited by her husband, she brought out &quot;Pilgrimages to English Shrines&quot; in 1849, and here the most beautiful of all her books, &quot;Midsummer Eve, a Fairy Tale of Love,&quot; was serialized. One of her last works, &quot;Boons and Blessings&quot;, 1875, dedicated to the Earl of Shaftesbury, is a collection of temperance tales, illustrated by the best artists.
Hall&#x27;s sketches of her native land bear a closer resemblance to the tales of Mary Russell Mitford than to the Irish stories of John Banim or Gerald Griffin. They contain fine rural descriptions, and are animated by a healthy tone of moral feeling and a vein of delicate humour. Her books were never popular in Ireland, as she saw in each party much to praise and much to blame, so that she failed to please either the Orangemen or the Roman Catholics.
On 10 December 1868, she was granted a civil list pension of £100 a year. She was instrumental in founding the Hospital for Consumption at Brompton (now the Royal Brompton Hospital), the Governesses&#x27; Institute (presumably the School Mistresses and Governesses’ Benevolent Institution), the Home for Decayed Gentlewomen (see Elizabeth Finn Care formerly the Distressed Gentlefolks&#x27; Aid Association), and the Nightingale Fund (used to set up what is now the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery). Her benevolence was of the most practical nature; she worked for the temperance cause, for women&#x27;s rights, and for the friendless and fallen. She was a friend to street musicians, and a thorough believer in spiritualism; but this belief did not prevent her from remaining a devout Christian. 

She kept the 50th anniversary of her wedding day on 20 September 1874. She died at Devon Lodge, East Moulsey, 30 January 1881, and was buried in Addlestone churchyard, 5 February.

==Works==

Other works were &quot;The Buccaneer&quot;, &quot;Can Wrong Be Right?&quot; and many sketches in the &quot;Art Journal&quot;, of which her husband Samuel Carter Hall was editor, and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s London Magazine&quot;. With her husband she also collaborated on a work entitled &quot;Ireland: Its Scenery, Character, etc.&quot; (1841–43).

<doc id="1078631" wikidata="Q1421265" url="?curid=1078631" title="Fitz-Greene Halleck">
<text>Fitz-Greene Halleck (July 8, 1790 – November 19, 1867) was an American poet and member of the Knickerbocker Group. Born and raised in Guilford, Connecticut, he went to New York City at the age of 20, and lived and worked there for nearly four decades. He was sometimes called &quot;the American Byron&quot;. His poetry was popular and widely read but later fell out of favor. It has been studied since the late twentieth century for its homosexual themes and insights into nineteenth-century society.

In 1832, Halleck, a cultural celebrity, started working as personal secretary and adviser to the philanthropist John Jacob Astor, who appointed him as one of the original trustees of the Astor Library. Given an annuity by Astor&#x27;s estate, in 1849 Halleck retired to Guilford, where he lived with his sister Marie Halleck for the remainder of his life.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Fitz-Greene Halleck was born on July 8, 1790, in Guilford, Connecticut, in a house at the corner of Whitfield and Water Streets. He had an older sister Marie, and his father owned a store in the town. At the age of two, the young Halleck experienced hearing loss when two soldiers fired off their guns next to his left ear; he was partially deaf for the remainder of his life. 
As a boy, Halleck attended the Academy on Guilford Green, whose schoolmaster was then Samuel Johnson, Junior, the compiler of &quot;A School Dictionary&quot;, the first dictionary both compiled and published in the United States. Halleck was a favorite of Johnson, who gave him a copy of Thomas Campbell&#x27;s first book of poems, &quot;The Pleasures of Hope&quot;, which was Halleck&#x27;s first personal book.
He left school at 15 to work in his family&#x27;s shop in Guilford.

===Early career===
In May 1811, the 20-year-old Halleck moved to New York City to find work. After a month of searching, he had all but given up and made plans to move to Richmond, Virginia, but he was hired by a banker named Jacob Barker. He worked for Barker for the next 20 years.

Halleck began to write with his friend Joseph Rodman Drake. In 1819 they wrote and published the anonymous &quot;Croaker Papers,&quot; which were satires of New York society. These 35 poems were published individually in the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; and &quot;National Advertiser&quot; over several months. An unauthorized collection was published in 1819 with 24 selections. They published the poems under the pseudonyms Croaker; Croaker, Jr.; and Croaker and Co., taken from a character in Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;The Good‐Natured Man&quot;. The &quot;Croakers&quot; were perhaps the first popular literary satire of New York, and New York society was thrilled to be the subject of erudite derision.

That year, Halleck wrote his longest poem , a satire on the literature, fashions, and politics of the time. It was modeled on Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Beppo&quot; and &quot;Don Juan&quot;. Published anonymously in December 1819, &quot;Fanny&quot; proved so popular that soon the initial 50 cent-edition was fetching up to $10. Two years later, its continuing popularity inspired Halleck to append an additional 50 stanzas.

Both Halleck and Drake became associated with the New York writers known as the Knickerbocker Group, led by William Cullen Bryant, James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving, pioneers in their fields. Drake advised Halleck to pursue becoming a nationally known poet and to sit on &quot;Appalachia&#x27;s brow.&quot; He thought contemplating the immense power of American nature would inspire his friend&#x27;s imagination. A medical student, Drake died in 1820 of consumption (tuberculosis) at age 25. Halleck commemorated his friend in &quot;The Death of Joseph Rodman Drake&quot; (1820), which begins, &quot;Green be the turf above thee&quot;.

Sarah Eckford Drake, the student&#x27;s young widow, was left with their daughter. She showed interest in having Halleck as her second husband. His satires included her as a figure, and in one he referred to her as a witch. She died young in 1828. Halleck never married.

In 1822, Halleck visited Europe and Great Britain, which influenced his poetry. &quot;Alnwick Castle&quot; was written that year and refers to a stately home in Northumberland. His long poem &quot;Marco Bozzaris&quot; (1825) was dedicated to the heroic Greek freedom fighter against the Turks, showing the continuing influence of Byron&#x27;s example. In 1827 Halleck published a collection, &quot;Alnwick Castle, with Other Poems&quot;, but after that his writing decreased.

===Professional and later life===
By 1830 Halleck had become a kind of celebrity for his poetry, sometimes called the American Byron. In 1832, Halleck was hired as the private secretary to John Jacob Astor. The wealthy fur trader merchant turned philanthropist later appointed him as one of the original trustees of the Astor Library (the basis of the New York Public Library). Halleck also served as Astor&#x27;s cultural tutor, advising him on pieces of art to purchase.

During this period, Halleck was widely read and was part of New York literary society. As one of the younger members of the Knickerbocker Group, he published with them and met associated visiting writers, such as Charles Dickens. His satires were thought to challenge the era&#x27;s &quot;sacred institutions&quot; and Halleck was known for his wit and charm.

At Astor&#x27;s death, the immensely wealthy—and tightfisted—man left Halleck an annuity in his will: of only $200 annually. His son William increased the amount to $1,500.

In 1841 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.

In 1849 Halleck retired to his hometown of Guilford. There he lived with his unmarried sister Marie Halleck for the remainder of his life. In April 1860, a lingering illness made Halleck give instructions for his funeral and burial, but he recovered. He often turned down requests for public appearances in his later years, and he complained about being pestered by &quot;frequent appeals for letters to hard-hearted editors&quot;. When people named children after him, Halleck seemed annoyed rather than honored. He wrote, &quot;I am favored by affectionate fathers with epistles announcing that their eldest-born has been named after me, a calamity that costs me a letter of profound gratefulness&quot;. Halleck&#x27;s last major poem, &quot;Young America&quot;, was published in 1867 in the &quot;New York Ledger&quot;.

On November 19, 1867, around 11:00 at night, he called out to his sister, &quot;Marie, hand me my pantaloons, if you please.&quot; He died without making another sound before she could turn around. He is buried at Alderbrook Cemetery in Guilford.

==Sexuality==
Halleck never married. His biographer Hallock believes that he was homosexual. He found that Halleck was enamored at the age of 19 with a young Cuban named Carlos Menie, to whom he dedicated a few of his early poems. Hallock suggests that Halleck was in love with his friend Joseph Rodman Drake. James Grant Wilson noted how the poet described serving as best man at Drake&#x27;s wedding:
&quot;[Drake] has married, and, as his wife&#x27;s father is rich, I imagine he will write no more. He was poor, as poets, of course, always are, and offered himself a sacrifice at the shrine of Hymen to shun the &#x27;pains and penalties&#x27; of poverty. I officiated as groomsman, though much against my will. His wife was good natured, and loves him to distraction. He is perhaps the handsomest man in New York, — a face like an angel, a form like an Apollo; and, as I well knew that his person was the true index of his mind, I felt myself during the ceremony as committing a crime in aiding and assisting such a sacrifice.&quot; 
Hallock described the poet Halleck&#x27;s last major work, &quot;Young America&quot;, as both &quot;a jaded critique of marriage and a pederastic boy-worship reminiscent of classical homosexuality.&quot;

In his will Halleck asked for Drake&#x27;s body and family to be exhumed and reburied with him. In 1903, plans were set to move the bodies of Drake, his wife, daughter, sister, and nephew to Halleck&#x27;s plot in Guilford.

==Critical response==
In the mid to late 19th century, Halleck was regarded as one of America&#x27;s leading poets and had a wide general readership; he was dubbed &quot;the American Byron&quot;. Among his most well-known poems was &quot;Marco Bozzaris&quot;, which Halleck noted was &quot;puffed in a thousand (more or less) magazines and newspapers&quot; in the United States, England, Scotland, and Ireland. Charles Dickens spoke fondly of the &quot;accomplished writer&quot; in a January 1868 letter to William Makepeace Thackeray (as recounted in &quot;Thackeray in the United States&quot;). It is not clear whether Dickens admired Halleck&#x27;s poetic skills or his wit and charm, which was often lauded by his contemporaries. Abraham Lincoln was known to occasionally read Halleck&#x27;s poetry aloud to friends in the White House.

The American writer and critic Edgar Allan Poe reviewed Halleck&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Alnwick Castle&quot;. Regarding Halleck&#x27;s poem &quot;Fanny&quot;, he said, &quot;to uncultivated ears... [it is] endurable, but to the practiced versifier it is little less than torture.&quot; In the September 1843 issue of &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Poe wrote that Halleck &quot;has nearly abandoned the Muses, much to the regret of his friends and to the neglect of his reputation.&quot; However, Poe also wrote, &quot;No name in the American poetical world is more firmly established than that of Fitz-Greene Halleck.&quot;

Halleck had several years in which he did not produce any literary works. After his death, poet William Cullen Bryant addressed the New York Historical Society on February 2, 1869, and spoke about this blank period in Halleck&#x27;s career. He ultimately concluded: &quot;Whatever the reason that Halleck ceased so early to write, let us congratulate ourselves that he wrote at all.&quot;

Since the later 20th century, Halleck&#x27;s poetry has been studied for its homosexual themes, and for what it reveals about the social world of the nineteenth century.

==Legacy==
*In 1869, the collected &quot;Poetical Writings&quot; and a traditional &quot;Life and Letters,&quot; both edited and written by James Grant Wilson, were published.
*Also in 1869, a granite monument was erected to Halleck in Guilford, the first to memorialize an American poet. The writer Bayard Taylor spoke at the commemoration. Taylor wrote America&#x27;s first homosexual novel, &quot;Joseph and His Friend&quot; (1870), believed to be a fictional account of the relationship between Halleck and Drake.
*In 1877 the memorial statue of Halleck was erected in New York&#x27;s Central Park; Halleck is the only American writer on the Literary Walk. It was dedicated by President Rutherford B. Hayes, with 10,000 people attending. After that, requirements for memorial statues in the park became more stringent.
*In 2006 the Fitz-Greene Halleck Society was founded to raise awareness of him and his work.

<text>Elizabeth Hamilton (1756 or 1758 – 23 July 1816) was a Scottish essayist, poet, satirist and novelist, who in both her prose and fiction entered into the French-revolutionary era controversy in Britain over the education and rights of women.

==Early life==
Hamilton was most likely born on 25 July 1756, though the date is often given as 1758. She was born in Belfast, the third and youngest child of Charles Hamilton (&quot;d&quot;.1759), a Scottish merchant, and his wife Katherine Mackay (&quot;d&quot;.1767).

In Belfast, Hamilton&#x27;s parents were on familiar terms with the town&#x27;s prominent &quot;New Light&quot; Presbyterian families and with their Scottish Enlightenment social and political ideas. Her later thoughts on child education were greatly influenced by David Manson&#x27;s co-educational English Grammar School, which her older sister Katherine attended with other children from this progressive milieu. Manson advertised the school&#x27;s capacity to teach children to read and understand the English language &quot;without the discipline of the rod by intermingling pleasurable and healthful exercise with their instruction&quot;.

In 1762, after the death of her father, her mother sent Hamilton to live with her paternal aunt, Mrs Marshall who lived near Stirling. In 1772, she lived at Ingram&#x27;s Crook near Bannockburn.

==Career==
Hamilton&#x27;s first literary efforts were directed in supporting her brother Charles in his orientalist and linguistic studies. After his death in 1792 she continued to publish orientalist scholarship, as well as historical, educationalist and theoretical works.

Hamilton maintained Belfast connections. She established a particularly close friendship with Martha McTier (sister of William Drennan, the founder of the United Irishmen), who pioneered schooling for poor girls. In 1793 she visited McTier in Belfast approving of her pedagogic efforts. &quot;My little girls&quot;, boasted McTier, &quot;do not gabble over the testament only, nor read with that difficulty which prevents pleasure in it... I keep up my number and four of them can read Fox and Pitt&quot;.

In 1796 she published &quot;Translation of the Letters of the Hindoo Rajah&quot;. The two volume work in the tradition of Montesquieu and Goldsmith, follows the adventures in England of an Indian prince. His encounters with slave owners, capricious aristocrats, sceptical philosophers and belligerent women leads to his progressive disillusionment with English culture.

In 1800 Hamilton produced &quot;Memoirs of Modern Philosophers&quot;. The novel was a response to the Revolution Controversy of the 1790s, a discussion of “revolutionary ideas about a broader franchise, primogeniture, meritocracy, marriage and divorce”. Conservative feminists such as Hannah More argued that “there is a different bent of understanding in the sexes” while those their detractors denounced as &quot;Jacobins&quot;, such as Mary Wollstonecraft, insisted that “there is no sex in the soul or mind” and that women were limited only by their inadequate education. In &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Hamilton occupies a middle ground, urging greater educational opportunity for women but within the bounds of a consciously Christian, middle-class morality that emphasises women&#x27;s responsibility for the domestic sphere.

Hamilton&#x27;s most important pedagogical works followed: &quot;Letters on Education&quot; (1801), &quot;Letters on the Elementary Principles of Education&quot; (1801), &quot;Letters addressed to the Daughter of a Nobleman, on the Formation of Religious and Moral Principle&quot; (1806), and &quot;Hints addressed to the Patrons and Directors of Schools&quot; (1815).

In 1808, Hamilton wrote &quot;The Cottagers of Glenburnie&quot; (1808), a celebrated tale of Scottish manners and mores which cast a critical eye on hardships and inequities endured by women in domestic life. It also occasioned a lengthy discourse on child education. The fictional Mr Gourley and Mrs Mason direct the teacher William Morrison&#x27;s efforts to reorganise his school on a spare-the-rod monitorial system emphasising accountability and self-government. Mrs Gourley cites David Manson&#x27;s account of &quot;what he calls his play school&quot;, and in a footnote Hamilton further acknowledges Manson. His &quot;extraordinary talents&quot;, she suggests, were exercised in Belfast &quot;in too limited a sphere&quot; to attract the attention they deserved.

Hamilton spent much of her later life in Edinburgh. She died in Harrogate, England after a short illness.

<text>Orthodoxy is a 1908 book by G. K. Chesterton which he described as a &quot;spiritual autobiography&quot;. It has become a classic of Christian apologetics.

Chesterton considered this book a companion to his other work, &quot;Heretics&quot;, which was a collection of essays aimed at refuting prevalent secular views of his time and defending the Christian orthodoxy. &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; was written expressly in response to G. S. Street&#x27;s criticism of &quot;Heretics&quot;. In it, Chesterton states that &quot;[Street] was not going to bother about his theology until I had really stated mine&quot;. In the preface, Chesterton states the purpose is to &quot;attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian faith can be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it.&quot; In &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, Chesterton presents an original view of Christian religion. He sees it as the answer to natural human needs – the &quot;answer to a riddle&quot; in his own words – and not simply as an arbitrary truth received from somewhere outside the boundaries of human experience.

== Summary ==
The book chronicles Chesterton&#x27;s personal journey to adopting a Christian worldview. Rather than rationalizing alleged paradoxes, &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; instead embraces them as evidence for the worldview&#x27;s validity. The first chapter establishes the view that human needs innately conflict, and, along with Chapter 8, &quot;The Romance of Orthodoxy&quot;, it explains Chesterton&#x27;s belief that the Christian worldview is most effective in both explaining and satisfying those disparate needs.

Chesterton began writing the book in response to Street&#x27;s 1905 challenge, titled &quot;Mr. Chesterton&quot;, and it was first published in 1908. The book was written when Chesterton was an Anglican. He converted to Catholicism 14 years later. Chesterton chose the title, &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, to focus on the plainness of the Apostles&#x27; Creed, though he admitted the general sound of the title was &quot;a thinnish sort of thing&quot;. Chesterton&#x27;s choice to focus on the Apostles&#x27; Creed made &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;&#x27;s apologetic appealing to Christians from various denominational backgrounds.

== Popular reception ==
&quot;Orthodoxy&quot; was influential in the conversion of Theodore Maynard to Roman Catholicism, as well as in the ordination of Canon Bernard Iddings Bell. In the magazine &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, critic James Parker recommends the book thus: &quot;If you&#x27;ve got an afternoon, read his masterpiece of Christian apologetics &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;: ontological basics retailed with a blissful, zooming frivolity, Thomas Aquinas meets Eddie Van Halen.&quot;

<doc id="1078637" wikidata="Q384142" url="?curid=1078637" title="Herbrand–Ribet theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Herbrand–Ribet theorem is a result on the class group of certain number fields. It is a strengthening of Ernst Kummer&#x27;s theorem to the effect that the prime &quot;p&quot; divides the class number of the cyclotomic field of &quot;p&quot;-th roots of unity if and only if &quot;p&quot; divides the numerator of the &quot;n&quot;-th Bernoulli number &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; 
for some &quot;n&quot;, 0 &lt; &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;p&quot; − 1. The Herbrand–Ribet theorem specifies what, in particular, it means when &quot;p&quot; divides such an &quot;Bn&quot;.

== Statement ==
The Galois group Δ of the cyclotomic field of &quot;p&quot;th roots of unity for an odd prime &quot;p&quot;, Q(ζ) with ζ&quot;p&quot; = 1, consists of the &quot;p&quot; − 1 group elements σ&quot;a&quot;, where formula_1. As a consequence of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, in the ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers formula_2 we have &quot;p&quot; − 1 roots of unity, each of which is congruent mod &quot;p&quot; to some number in the range 1 to &quot;p&quot; − 1; we can therefore define a Dirichlet character ω (the Teichmüller character) with values in formula_2 by requiring that for &quot;n&quot; relatively prime to &quot;p&quot;, ω(&quot;n&quot;) be congruent to &quot;n&quot; modulo &quot;p&quot;. The &quot;p&quot; part of the class group is a formula_2-module (since it is &quot;p&quot;-primary), hence a module over the group ring formula_5. We now define idempotent elements of the group ring for each &quot;n&quot; from 1 to &quot;p&quot; − 1, as

:formula_6

It is easy to see that formula_7 and formula_8 where formula_9 is the Kronecker delta. This allows us to break up the &quot;p&quot; part of the ideal class group &quot;G&quot; of Q(ζ) by means of the idempotents; if &quot;G&quot; is the &quot;p&quot;-primary part of the ideal class group, then, letting &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot; = ε&quot;n&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), we have formula_10.

The Herbrand–Ribet theorem states that for odd &quot;n&quot;, &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot; is nontrivial if and only if &quot;p&quot; divides the Bernoulli number &quot;B&quot;&quot;p&quot;−&quot;n&quot;. 

The theorem makes no assertion about even values of &quot;n&quot;, but there is no known &quot;p&quot; for which &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot; is nontrivial for any even &quot;n&quot;: triviality for all &quot;p&quot; would be a consequence of Vandiver&#x27;s conjecture.

== Proofs ==
The part saying &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;B&quot;&quot;p&quot;−&quot;n&quot; if &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot; is not trivial is due to Jacques Herbrand. The converse, that if &quot;p&quot; divides &quot;B&quot;&quot;p&quot;−&quot;n&quot; then &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot; is not trivial is due to Kenneth Ribet, and is considerably more difficult. By class field theory, this can only be true if there is an unramified extension of the field of &quot;p&quot;th roots of unity by a cyclic extension of degree &quot;p&quot; which behaves in the specified way under the action of Σ; Ribet proves this by actually constructing such an extension using methods in the theory of modular forms. A more elementary proof of Ribet&#x27;s converse to Herbrand&#x27;s theorem, a consequence of the theory of Euler systems, can be found in Washington&#x27;s book.

== Generalizations ==
Ribet&#x27;s methods were developed further by Barry Mazur and Andrew Wiles in order to prove the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory, a corollary of which is a strengthening of the Herbrand–Ribet theorem: the power of &quot;p&quot; dividing &quot;B&quot;&quot;p&quot;−&quot;n&quot; is exactly the power of &quot;p&quot; dividing the order of &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

<doc id="1078638" wikidata="Q192567" url="?curid=1078638" title="Ili River">
<text>The Ili River (, , ; ; ; , ; , ; , ) is a river in Northwest China and Southeastern Kazakhstan. It flows from the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region to the Almaty Region in Kazakhstan.

It is long (including its source river the Tekes), of which is in Kazakhstan. The river originates from the Tekes and Künes rivers in Eastern Tian Shan. The Ili drains the basin between the Tian Shan and the Borohoro Mountains. Flowing into Lake Balkhash (in the endorheic Balkhash-Alakol Basin), the Ili forms a large delta with vast wetland regions of lakes, marshes and vegetation.
==Name==
The river&#x27;s name is usually taken to derive from Mongolian (, &quot;open, clear, obvious&quot;) in reference to its wide central valley. It is also variously derived from Persian or Iranian terms meaning &quot;big river&quot; or &quot;murky&quot; in reference to the water&#x27;s condition at the confluence of the Kunges and Tekes. Some Uyghur scholars derive it from Uyghur (&quot;hook&quot;) after the supposed similarity in the river&#x27;s shape. Tourist websites sometimes claim the name descends from the Mongolian word &quot;ilansu&quot;, meaning &quot;shimmering&quot; or &quot;sparkling&quot;.

Mentions of &quot;Ili&quot; river can be traced back to the Mahmud al-Kashgari&#x27;s dictionary of Turkic languages, the &quot;Dīwānu l-Luġat al-Turk&quot; (written in 1072–74). In the book, the author defines it in the following way: &quot;Ili, the name of a river. Turkic tribes of &quot;Yaghma&quot;, &quot;Tokhsi&quot; and &quot;Chiglig&quot; live on its banks. Turkish countries regard the river as their Jayhoun (Amu Darya).&quot;

== Chinese region ==

The upper Ili Valley is separated from the Dzungarian Basin in the north by the Borohoro Mountains, and from the Tarim Basin in the south by the Tian Shan. This region was the stronghold of the Qing administration in Xinjiang in the late 18th and 19th centuries. It was occupied by Russia from 1871 to 1881 (from the Yaqub Beg rebellion until the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)).

Presently, the region forms part of Xinjiang&#x27;s Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. The main city of the region, Yining (Kulja), is located on the northern side of the river (about upstream from the international border). Until the early 1900s, the city was commonly known under the same name as the river, (Pinyin: ; Wade-Giles: ). Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County in located on the southern side, which is home to many of China&#x27;s Xibe people (who resettled there in the 18th century as part of the Manchu Garrison).

There are at least two dams on the Ili&#x27;s tributary, the Kash River (), in Nilka County, at and
. At least two dams have been constructed on the Ili&#x27;s left tributary, the Tekes River, and the Qiapuqihai Hydropower Station () in Tokkuztara County (). There is also another smaller dam at , on the border of Tokkuztara and Künes Counties.

== Kazakh region ==

The Ili is the main watercourse of the Balkhash-Alakol Basin. The region of Kazakhstan partially drained by the Ili and its tributaries is known in Kazakh as Zhetysu (&#x27;Seven Rivers&#x27;). In Russian it is known as Semirechye (meaning the same).

The Kapshagay Hydroelectric Power Plant was constructed between 1965 and 1970 near Kapchagay in the middle reaches of the Ili River. This currently comprises the Kapchagay Reservoir, an artificial long lake north of Almaty.

The Tamgaly-Tas, a protected site that comprises rock drawings, is located downstream along the Ili River. The name in Kazakh means &quot;painted&quot; or &quot;marked place&quot;, and means &quot;stone&quot;.

== Ili Delta ==

The Ili River flows into the southeastern edge of Lake Balkhash, where it forms a large delta of about . The delta is situated between the Saryesik-Atyrau Desert and the Taukum Desert. An area of within the delta has been designated as a Ramsar Site. This site has 427 species of plants and 345 species of animals, including important populations of rare species (Dalmatian pelican, goitered gazelle, marbled polecat, white-headed duck, red-breasted goose, ship sturgeon, and others). The delta has also become popular amongst anglers for its wels catfish, which can grow up to over . The Ili river ranks third in Kazakhstan after the Irtysh river and the Ural river in terms of water content.

The Government of Kazakhstan plans to join the three sanctuaries Balkash, Karoy and Kukan (situated in the delta) into one National Park. Until 1948, the delta was a refuge of the extinct Caspian tiger. An introduction of the Siberian tiger to the delta has been proposed on account that it is a genetically close relative of the Caspian tiger. A large population of wild boar, the main prey base of the Caspian tiger, can be still found in the delta. There is also a small population of roe deer. In the drier steppes to the south of the delta live saiga antelopes and goitered gazelles.

Reintroduction of the Bactrian deer, another prey of the Caspian tiger, is currently under consideration. Another potential prey species considered to be reintroduced is the Asiatic wild ass.

== Historical connections ==
The Ili River treaty of 638 AD formalized the division of the Western Turkic Kaganate (552–638 AD) into the Nushibi and the Dulu. It also established the Ili River as the border between the two states. In the 21st century, increasing need for water in both China and Kazakhstan makes the management of the cross-border Ili River a topic of concern for environmentalists and politicians in Kazakhstan (who feel that their country may not get enough water flowing in from China any more).

The amount of precipitation in summer reaches .

==Fishing==

On the river, the most popular type of fishing is fishing of catfish, one of the largest aquatic predators, which may reach in length and weigh up to . Smaller specimens are usually within .

==Gallery==

== Tributaries ==
The main tributaries of the Ili are, from source to mouth:
* Tekes
* Künes
* Kash
* Khorgos
* Charyn, famous for its canyon
* Chilik
* Talgar
* Kaskelen
* Kurty

<text>William Hamilton (1704–1754) was a Scottish poet associated with the Jacobite movement.

==Life==
Hamilton was born at the family seat in Ecclesmachan, West Lothian. 
He was the second son of James Hamilton of Bangour, advocate, whose grandfather, James, second son of John Hamilton of Little Earnock, Lanarkshire, founded the Bangour family. 
On the death of his elder brother, without heir, in 1750, Hamilton succeeded to the estate.

His naturally delicate constitution, as well as his tastes, had all along prevented him from going much into fashionable society, and from his early years he started writing poetry, receiving ready commendation from his friends. 
Between 1724 and 1727, he contributed lyrics to Allan Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;Tea Table Miscellany&quot;, and he showed a practical interest in the success of the &quot;Gentle Shepherd.&quot; 
This poem is dedicated, 25 June 1725, to the beautiful and much admired Susanna Montgomery, Countess of Eglinton, whose favourable consideration of Ramsay&#x27;s merits is further solicited by Hamilton in a set of spirited heroic couplets following the dedication. 
The poet&#x27;s ardour in his love-songs led, at least in one case, to a feeling of resentment on the part of a lady, who consulted his close friend Henry Home, Lord Kames in her dilemma, and, acting on his advice to profess a return of affection, quickly startled Hamilton into an attitude of distant reserve.
Heartily espousing the cause of the Stuarts, Hamilton in his &quot;Gladsmuir&quot; celebrated the Jacobite victory at Prestonpans. 
After Culloden he was for a time in hiding in the highlands, and &quot;A Soliloquy wrote in June 1746&quot; is charged with a deep feeling of his troubles. 
Ultimately he succeeded along with others in reaching France. 
On the intercession of influential friends, he was allowed to return to Scotland, but the great strain had deeply affected his weak constitution, and he found it impossible to remain at home. 
His last days were spent at Lyons, where he died of consumption, 25 March 1754. 
His body was brought to Scotland, and buried in the Abbey Church, Holyrood.

==Family==
Hamilton was twice married, and James, his son by his first wife, a daughter of Sir James Hall, 2nd bart.of Dunglass, succeeded to the estate.

<text>William Hamilton (1665? – 24 May 1751) was a Scottish poet. He wrote comic, mock-tragic poetry such as &quot;The Last Dying Words of Bonny Heck&quot; - a once-champion hare coursing greyhound in the East Neuk of Fife who was about to be hanged, for growing too slow. It is written in anglified Scots, with a sprightly narrative and wry comic touches.

==Life==
Hamilton was born in Ladyland, Ayr (now North Ayrshire), Scotland. In the &quot;Familiar Epistles&quot; he exchanged with Allan Ramsay, he modestly acknowledges the limitations of his own muse. Ramsay singles out &quot;Heck&quot; as he suggests there is room for all sorts in poetry. Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;Epistles&quot; in return are certainly more skillful, more self-consciously Scots and with lots more allusions to other authors, Ancient and Modern, but they are consequently, less direct than those of Hamilton. Another of Hamilton&#x27;s poems, &quot;Willie was a Wanton Wag&quot;, - about a young man who appears at a wedding feast, and enraptures bride and bridesmaids by his &quot;leg&quot; at dancing - appeared in Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;Tea-Table Miscellany&quot;.

The references in the &quot;Familiar Epistles&quot; to their delight in drinking in the taverns of Edinburgh, and references to thinly disguised mutual acquaintances, point up how well Hamilton was integrated into the literary world of the capital. He is praised by Burns in one of his poems. In his &quot;Epistle to William Simpson&quot;, Burns mentions &quot;Ramsay, Gilbertfield&quot; and Fergusson, as poets in whose company fame would be a pleasure. My senses wad be in a creel&lt;br&gt;
Should I but dare a hope to speel &lt;br&gt;
Wi’ Allan, or wi Gilbertfield, &lt;br&gt;
The braes o fame; &lt;br&gt;
Or Fergusson, the writer chiel &lt;br&gt;
A deathless name. 

Hamilton tried his hand at epic poetry in an abridgment in 18th century English of Blind Harry&#x27;s &quot;The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace&quot;. &quot;...wherein the Old, obsolete words are rendered more intelligible and adapted to the understanding of such who have not leisure to study the Meaning and Import of such Parases (sic) without the aid of a Glossary.&quot; This enthused the young Burns, who records, in his Autobiographical Letter, that it &quot;&quot;...poured a Scottish prejudice in my veins which will boil along there till the flood gates of life shut in eternal rest&quot;.&quot; 

He also served in the army and retired with the rank of Lieutenant.

<doc id="1078642" wikidata="Q5326375" url="?curid=1078642" title="Earl of Stamford">
<text>Earl of Stamford was a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1628 for Henry Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Groby. This Grey family descended through Lord John Grey, of Pirgo, Essex, younger son of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, and younger brother of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk (father of Lady Jane Grey); Suffolk was executed for treason in 1554 forfeiting his titles (see the Duke of Suffolk for earlier history of the family).

==History==
Lord John Grey&#x27;s son Sir Henry Grey was in 1603 raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Grey of Groby, &quot;in the County of Leicester&quot;. He was succeeded by his grandson, the second Baron, who was created Earl of Stamford in the Peerage of England in 1628. Lord Stamford later fought as a Parliamentarian in the Civil War. His eldest son Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby, was a leading Parliamentarian in the Civil War. Stamford was one of the judges at the trial of Charles I and one of the regicides who signed the King&#x27;s death warrant. He predeceased his father and never succeeded to the earldom. Lord Stamford&#x27;s daughter Lady Elizabeth Grey married George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer, and was the mother of Henry Booth, 1st Earl of Warrington. Stamford was succeeded by his grandson Thomas, the second Earl and the only son of Lord Grey of Groby. Thomas Grey was a politician and served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and as President of the Board of Trade. He was childless and on his death in 1720 the titles passed to his first cousin Harry, the third Earl. He was the son of the Hon. John Grey, younger son of the first Earl.

He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He briefly represented Leicestershire in the House of Commons. Lord Stamford married his second cousin once removed Lady Mary Booth, daughter of George Booth, 2nd Earl of Warrington (on whose death in 1758 the earldom of Warrington became extinct). When Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford died the titles passed to his son, George Grey, the fifth Earl; he sat as Member of Parliament for Staffordshire and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Cheshire. In 1796 the barony of Delamer (which became extinct in 1770) and earldom of Warrington held by his mother&#x27;s family was revived by his creation as Baron Delamer and Earl of Warrington in the Peerage of Great Britain - he refused the offer of a marquessate, so as to become known as the Earl of Stamford and Warrington in recognition of the great estates he had inherited from the Booth family. He was succeeded by his son, George Grey, the sixth Earl. He represented Aldborough and St Germans in Parliament and was Lord-Lieutenant of Cheshire. His son styled Lord Grey of Groby (1802–1835), was summoned to the House of Lords by a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s subsidiary title of Baron Grey of Groby in 1833; he, however, predeceased his father. Lord Stamford was therefore succeeded by his grandson, George Grey, the seventh Earl. He was the son of Lord Grey of Groby and had already succeeded as ninth Baron Grey of Groby on his father&#x27;s death. Lord Stamford was a great patron of the Turf. On his death in 1883, the barony of Delamer and earldom of Warrington became extinct (although his wife remained Countess of Stamford and Warrington until her death in 1905).

The seventh Earl was succeeded in the barony of Grey of Groby and the earldom of Stamford by his third cousin once removed the Reverend Harry Grey, as eighth Earl. He was the son of the Reverend Harry Grey, son of the Hon. John Grey, third son of the fourth Earl. He lived in South Africa, and had married his housekeeper Martha Solomons after she had already given birth to two of his children, the elder of whom was a boy. As this son was born before the date of his father&#x27;s marriage, his illegitimacy prevented his inheriting the title; while a third child, born after the marriage and therefore legitimate, could not inherit the earldom because she was female. More information on this episode can be found in &quot;Enthusiasms&quot;, essays by the historian Mark Girouard.

The eighth Earl was succeeded by his nephew, William Grey, the ninth Earl. However, it was not until 1892 that the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords confirmed the latter in the title, as the Committee wished to be assured that the marriage contracted by the eighth Earl while he lived abroad had not produced a legitimate heir. On the ninth Earl&#x27;s death the titles passed to his son, Roger Grey, the tenth Earl. He served briefly as Parliamentary Private Secretary (unpaid) to the Secretary of State for India, Lord Peel, in 1922 and was also Mayor of Altrincham from 1937 to 1938. Lord Stamford never married and on his death in 1976 his family titles became extinct.

==Estates==
The main family seat of the Earls of Stamford in later years was Dunham Massey Hall, near Altrincham, Cheshire. Dunham Massey was bequeathed to the National Trust by the 10th and last Earl.

Another ancestral seat of the Grey family was Enville Hall, Staffordshire, and the house is occupied by relatives of Catherine Cox, Countess of Stamford and Warrington born 11 October 1826 Sturminster Marshall, Dorset died 29 January 1905 Bradgate House, Groby, Leicestershire. This was devised (bequeathed) by George Harry Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford to his great niece, Catherine Payne, who married Sir Henry Foley Lambert, 7th Baronet (who took the surname Grey) in 1905, and subsequently to his granddaughter. Catherine Payne was the granddaughter of Tamar Cox and a sister of Catherine, Countess of Stamford and Warrington, Catherine Payne&#x27;s mother was the illegitimate daughter called Sarah Letitia Cox and was one of three illegitimate children born to Tamar Cox. Sarah Letitia Cox was brought up under the wing of her aunt Catherine, Countess of Stamford and Warrington and Catherine also took under her wing Robert Miller Cox illegitimate son of Tamar and who became the estate agent at Dunham Massey Hall.

The 7th Earl had a house which he called Bradgate House built in the village of Groby, Leicestershire and this was designed by the architect Mr. M.J. Dain of Dain and Parsons, London, and built by the local builder Mr. Thomas Rudkin; Bradgate House was completed in 1856 and was also built in the Jacobean style and it has been referred to as the Calendar House because it had 365 windows, 52 rooms, and 12 main chimneys.

Bradgate house in Bradgate park, Leicestershire is often confused with Bradgate House built in the 1850s in the village of Groby, Leicestershire.

<text>James Hannay FRSE (17 February 1827 – 9 January 1873), was a Scottish novelist, journalist and diplomat.

==Early life==
Hannay was born at Dumfries, Scotland, on 17 February 1827. His father, David Hannay (1794–1864), a member of the Speculative Society at Edinburgh University, 1813–14, and author of &quot;Ned Allen, or the Past Age,&quot; 1849, was engaged in business in Dumfries. The family had some reason for believing that they were descended from the Hannays of Sorble. In James Hannay, the belief was sufficiently strong to influence his studies, inclining him to study heraldry and family history.

==Naval career==
Hannay entered the Royal Navy on 2 March 1840, on board , and served in her during the blockade of Alexandria in the Syrian war, and had therefore no share in the operations of Sir Charles Napier&#x27;s squadron at Acre. From &quot;Cambridge&quot; he passed in succession to the sloop in 1842, the corvette in 1843, and in 1844. His tastes and his impatience both of routine work and control unfitted him for the life of a naval officer. Very soon after entering the service, he began to devote himself to general reading, and even studied Latin with a priest at Malta. With the instinct of a born journalist, he started a manuscript comic paper to ridicule the admiral and captains on the Mediterranean Station. At a later period, he was wont to confess that he had been a somewhat insubordinate midshipman.

In 1845, Hannay and two brother-officers were tried by court-martial and dismissed the service. The finding of the court was generally thought to have been vindictive, and it was subsequently quashed on the ground of informality. Hannay was not, however, employed again, nor did he seriously seek for employment.

==Journalist==
From 1846 onwards till his appointment as consul in 1868, Hannay worked on the press and at literature. His first engagement was as a reporter on the &quot;Morning Chronicle,&quot; in which capacity he relied more on his remarkable memory than on his knowledge of shorthand. In the meantime, he was reading zealously in the British Museum. At the end of 1847, he worked with Henry Sutherland Edwards on &quot;Pasquin,&quot; a very short-lived comic paper, and the forerunner of the somewhat happier &quot;Puppet Show,&quot; which lasted from 1848 to 1849.

In 1848, he began using his naval experiences, and wrote the first of the stories which were afterwards collected in his &quot;Sketches in Ultramarine,&quot; published in 1853. 
In 1848, he first made the acquaintance of Thackeray and Carlyle, to whom he was proud to acknowledge his obligations. He soon improved his literary connection, and worked for papers of good position, for the quarterlies and magazines, till he became editor of the &quot;Edinburgh Evening Courant&quot; in 1860.

During these years he published his best work, his two naval novels, &quot;Singleton Fontenoy&quot; (1850) and &quot;Eustace Conyers&quot; (1855), and the volume of lectures on &quot;Satire and Satirist,&quot; delivered at the Literary Institution, Edward Street, Portman Square, in 1853, and collected in book form in 1854. It was during these years also that he began to write the essays to the &quot;Quarterly,&quot; afterwards collected into a volume, and that he taught himself to read Greek.

In 1857, he contested without success the representation of the Dumfries Burghs in parliament. He stood as a Tory, and was defeated by William Ewart. From 1860 to 1864, he edited the &quot;Edinburgh Evening Courant.&quot; 
The zeal with which he attacked conduct and persons he disliked caused his management of the paper to be somewhat conspicuous.

In 1863 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being William Edmonstoune Aytoun.

==Consul==
In 1864, he returned to London, and remained there till he was appointed consul at Brest by Lord Stanley, in 1868. During these years, he published his &quot;Studies on Thackeray&quot; (1869), his &quot;Three Hundred Years of a Norman House&quot; (1866), a portion of a history of the Gurney family, and his &quot;Course of English Literature&quot; (1866), a reprint of articles contributed years before to the &quot;Welcome Guest.&quot; Hannay did not proceed to Brest, but exchanged this post for that of Barcelona in Spain. Although he continued to write for papers and magazines, chiefly for the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and the &quot;Cornhill,&quot; he published no more books.

==Death==
Hannay&#x27;s death occurred very suddenly on 9 January 1873 at Putchet, a suburb of Barcelona.

==Family==
Hannay was twice married, first, in 1853, to Margaret Anne Thompson (1833–1865), who was the niece of the artist Kenny Meadows, and who died in 1865; and then, in 1868, to Jean Hannay, a lady of the same name, but of no traceable relationship, who died in Spain in 1870. He had by the first marriage six, and by the second one child, who survived him.

<doc id="1078647" wikidata="Q2996371" url="?curid=1078647" title="Utsuls">
<text>The Utsuls ([]; ) are a Chamic-speaking ethnic group which lives on the island of Hainan and are considered one of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s unrecognized ethnic groups. They are found on the southernmost tip of Hainan, in the two villages of Huihui (回辉) and Huixin (回新) of Tianya district in the city of Sanya.

==History==
The Utsuls are thought to be descendants of Cham refugees who fled their homeland of Champa in what is now modern Central Vietnam to escape the Vietnamese invasion. After the Vietnamese completed the conquest of Cham in 1471, sacking Vijaya, the last capital of the Cham kingdom, a Cham prince and about 1,000 followers moved to Hainan, where the Ming dynasty allowed them to stay. Several Chinese accounts record Cham arriving on Hainan even earlier, from 986, shortly after the Vietnamese captured the earlier Cham capital of Indrapura in 982, while other Cham refugees settled in Guangzhou.

While most of the Chams who fled Champa to Cambodia, a small business class fled northwards. How they came to acquire the name Utsul is unknown.

Their population was greatly reduced during the Second Sino-Japanese War by the Japanese that more than 4,000 Chams were killed in Sanya as Chinese armies were hiding among them from the invading Japanese. Hundreds of Utsul Muslim houses and mosques in Sanya were destroyed by the Japanese in order to build an airport.

=== Discrimination ===

In 2020, it was reported that Beijing had started a religious crackdown aimed at the Utsul community as part of their political efforts. Restrictions included limiting the size of mosques, requiring a Chinese Communist Party member on mosque management committees, forbidding the use of Arabic words on food stalls (such as &quot;halal&quot;), and forbidding the wearing of hijab.

==Identity==
Although they are culturally, ethnically and linguistically distinct from the Hui, the Chinese government nevertheless classifies them as Hui due to their Islamic faith. From reports by Hans Stübel, the German ethnographer who made contact with them in the 1930s, however, their language is completely unrelated to any other language spoken in mainland China.

==Genetics==
A genetic study by Li et al. (2013) suggested that the surviving Utsat were genetically much closer to the indigenous Hlai people than to the Cham and other mainland southeast Asian populations. The study suggests that there was high assimilation of the indigenous Hlai in the formation of the Utsat.

==Family names==
Some common Utsul family names include Chen, Ha, Hai, Jiang, Li, Liu and Pu.

==Famous people==
* Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, 5th Prime Minister of Malaysia. His maternal grandfather is of Utsul descent.

<doc id="1078650" wikidata="Q4821445" url="?curid=1078650" title="Augustus Hare">
<text>Augustus John Cuthbert Hare (13 March 1834 – 22 January 1903) was an English writer, painter, and raconteur.

==Early life==
He was the youngest son of Francis George Hare of Herstmonceux, East Sussex, and Gresford, Flintshire, Wales, and the nephew of Augustus William Hare and Julius Hare. 
Augustus Hare was born in Rome; he was adopted by his aunt, the widow of Augustus Hare, and his parents renounced all further claims to him. His autobiography &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; (1896–1900) details both a devotion to his adopted mother, Maria, and an intense unhappiness with his home education at Buckwell Place. He spent one year at Harrow School in 1847 but left due to ill health. In 1853, he matriculated at University College, Oxford, graduating in 1857 with a BA.

==Career==

Hare was the author of a large number of books, which fall into two classes: biographies of members and connections of his family, and descriptive and historical accounts of various countries and cities. To the first belong &quot;Memorials of a Quiet Life&quot; (about his adoptive mother), &quot;Story of Two Noble Lives&quot; (about Countess Canning and the Marchioness of Waterford, sisters and artists), &quot;The Gurneys of Earlham&quot; (about the Gurney family of bankers and social reformers of Earlham Hall near Norwich), and an autobiography in six volumes. This last included a number of accounts of encounters with ghosts. A reviewer in the &quot;New York Times&quot; concluded that &quot;Mr Hare&#x27;s ghosts are rather more interesting than his lords or his middle-class people&quot;.

He also compiled numerous travel books, including a couple for John Murray, as well as many others under his own name, such as &quot;Walks in Rome&quot;, &quot;Walks in London&quot;, &quot;Wanderings in Spain&quot;, &quot;Cities of Northern, Southern, and Central Italy&quot; (separate works), &quot;Days near Rome&quot; and &quot;Sussex&quot;. A number of his travel books were revised in later editions by the historian Welbore St Clair Baddeley (1856–1945).

Hare was a friend to the barrister Basil Levett and his wife Lady Mary Levett, the daughter of the Earl of Shaftesbury, to whom Hare left a painting in his will. (&quot;Basil Levett or his wife Lady Margaret Copy of the Last Communion of S Jerome by Domenichino.&quot;)

Hare died unmarried in 1903, and was buried in Herstmonceux.

==Holmhurst==
Hare spent his money on purchasing and refurbishing a house in Baldslow, Sussex, near Hastings, which he named Holmhurst St Mary.

In his biography of Somerset Maugham, writer Ted Morgan mentions that Hare, whom he refers to as &quot;the last Victorian,&quot; befriended Maugham, who became a frequent guest at Holmhurst.

After Hare&#x27;s death, the house was taken by Admiral Sir Lewis Beaumont and family, and then from 1908 Sir John Gordon Kennedy and family. In 1913 the estate was purchased by the Community of the Holy Family, an Anglican order of teaching nuns, with a focus on art and scholarship. Their mother foundress, Agnes Mason, who had formed the community in London in 1896 and later brought it to Sussex, recognised the house and gardens as a piece of Italy – specifically Florence – in England. The girls&#x27; school that the nuns ran there, from the 1930s to the 1980s, was known as &quot;St Mary&#x27;s Convent School, the Ridge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicengland/1043422&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its best-known pupil was Joanna Lumley, an &quot;army brat&quot; who boarded in the 1960s: &quot;I especially loved my second boarding school, an Anglo-Catholic convent in the hills behind Hastings. The nuns wore blue stockings and were brainy and lovely. There were 70 boarders and I was happy as a clam.&quot;

<text>Augustus William Hare (17 November 1792 – 22 January 1834) was a British writer who was the author of a history of Germany.

==Life==
Hare was the son of Francis Hare-Naylor and his wife, the artist Georgiana, daughter of Jonathan Shipley, Bishop of Llandaff and Bishop of St Asaph.

His godmother was his mother&#x27;s sister Anna Maria, widow of Sir William Jones. She enabled him to attend Winchester College, and New College, Oxford, in the latter of which he was for some time a tutor. Weak health prevented him especially distinguishing himself, but in 1810 he was elected to a vacancy at New College. With his school-friends he established one of the first Oxford debating clubs, The Attic Society, which supplied his chief interest at college.

Lady Jones wished him to qualify himself for the rich family living of Hurstmonceaux, Sussex, by taking orders, but he offended her by refusing. In the last years of his undergraduate life, he offended the college authorities by an attempt to extinguish the privileges of founder&#x27;s kin at Winchester and New College, and he printed an attack, in the form of a letter to his friend George Martin, on the privilege which permitted New College men to graduate without public examinations. After a long absence in Italy, Hare returned to New College as a tutor in 1818. In June 1824 he published a defence of the Gospel narrative of the Resurrection, entitled &quot;A Layman&#x27;s Letters to the Authors of the &quot;Trial of the Witnesses&quot;&quot;. In 1825, he was ordained in Winchester College Chapel. With his brother Julius, Hare wrote &quot;Guesses at Truth&quot;, an &quot;influential miscellany&quot; of essays.

On 2 June 1829, having been recently appointed to the small college living of Alton Barnes in Wiltshire, Hare married Maria Leycester, daughter of the rector of Stoke-on-Terne, Shropshire. Entering the Church, he became incumbent of the rural parish of Alton Barnes during the last three years of this life. While there, he wrote at least two volumes of sermons, which were published posthumously by his brother Julius.

His failing health obliged them to go for the winter to Italy, where he died at Rome, 18 February 1834. The same year, his nephew and namesake, Augustus Hare, was born. He was buried at the foot of the pyramid of Caius Cestius, in the old Protestant cemetery. His widow, who survived till 13 November 1870, went to live in the parish of her brother-in-law Julius, and is buried in Hurstmonceaux churchyard.

<doc id="1078654" wikidata="Q558410" url="?curid=1078654" title="Henry Harland">
<text>Henry Harland (March 1, 1861 – December 20, 1905) was an American novelist and editor.

==Biography==
Harland was born in Norwich, Connecticut, in 1861, the son of Fourierist Thomas Harland, who had been a one-time roommate of editor and author Edmund Clarence Stedman. He was raised in New York and, after the Civil War, the Harlands lived in a German Jewish section of the city. 

Harland attended the City College of New York and briefly Harvard Divinity School. In May 1884, he married Aline Herminie Merriam, who shared his artistic interests. His literary career falls into two distinct sections. During the first of these, writing under the pseudonym Sidney Luska, he produced a series of highly sensational novels, written with little regard to literary quality. His novels written under this persona in the 1880s became the first popularly-read books to feature the American Jewish experience, which Harland both celebrated and criticized. Harland&#x27;s depictions were met with wide criticism from the Jewish community. One review in the Philadelphia-based &quot;Jewish Exponent&quot; said one of his books was &quot;grossly inartistic&quot; and expressed &quot;condescension&quot; and &quot;vulgar assumption towards Jews&quot;. Kaufmann Kohler in &quot;The Menorah&quot; complained that, in Harland&#x27;s novels &quot;the Jews, as a class, lack refinement&quot;.

But in 1889 Harland moved to London and fell under the influence of the Aesthetic movement. He began writing under his own name and, in 1894, became the founding editor of &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;. The short story collections of this new period, &quot;A Latin Quarter Courtship&quot; (1889), &quot;Mademoiselle Miss&quot; (1893), &quot;Grey Roses&quot; (1895), and &quot;Comedies and Errors&quot; (1898), were praised by critics but had little general popularity. He finally achieved a wide readership with &quot;The Cardinal&#x27;s Snuff-box&quot; (1900), which was followed by &quot;The Lady Paramount&quot; (1901) and &quot;My Friend Prospero&quot; (1903). Hamlin Garland met him around this time and noted that he had affected a fake English accent. Garland recalled, &quot;his &#x27;extraoinary&#x27; English accent was comical. He spoke quite like the caricatured Englishman of our comedy stage. He is completely expatriated now and unpleasantly aggressive in his defense of England and English ways.&quot;

Harland&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Royal End&quot; (1909), was incomplete when he died. His wife finished it according to his notes. He died in 1905 at Sanremo, Italy, after a prolonged period of tuberculosis.

After his death, Henry James wrote positively about both Harland and &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, though he had previously disparaged both.

<doc id="1078656" wikidata="Q803986" url="?curid=1078656" title="Beit Lahia">
<text>Beit Lahia or Beit Lahiya () is a city in the Gaza Strip, north of Jabalia, in the North Gaza Governorate of the State of Palestine. It sits next to Beit Hanoun and close to the border with Israel. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the city had a population of 89,838 in 2017.

==Geography==
Beit Lahia is surrounded by dunes, some of which rise to above sea level. The area is renowned for its many large sycamore fig trees. The city is known for its fresh, sweet water, berries and citrus trees. According to Edward Henry Palmer, &quot;Lahia&quot; was from &quot;Lahi&quot;, a personal name.

==History==
===Roman period===
Beit Lahia has an ancient hill and nearby lay abandoned village ruins. The town has been identified as the &quot;Bethelia&quot; and had originally a pagan temple.

According to the 5th century historian Sozomen, whose family had lived in the town for several generations, the townspeople started converting to Christianity due to the hermit Hilarion who is attributed to have healed miraculously a citizen called Alaphion. An eremitic center was founded around the year 360 in the village, housing around four anchorites who were disciples of Hilarion. Ceramics from the Byzantine period have been found.

===Early Islamic period===
A mihrab, or mosque alcove indicating the direction of salah (Muslim daily prayers), is all that remains of an ancient mosque to the west of Beit Lahia dating to the end of the Fatimid Caliphate and beginning of the Ayyubid dynasty of Saladin, and two other mosques dating to the Gaza Sanjak of the Ottoman era. Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229) described &quot;Bait Lihya&quot; as being located &quot;near Ghazzah&quot;, and he further noted that &quot;it is a village with many fruit-trees&quot;.

===Mamluk period===
A marble slab, deposited in the maqam of &quot;Salim Abu Musallam&quot; in Beit Lahia is inscribed in late Mamluk naskhi letters. It is an epitaph over four sons of the Governor of Gaza, Aqbay al-Ashrafi, who all died in the month of Rajab 897 (=29 April-9 May 1492 CE). It is assumed that the children died of the plague, described by Mujir al-Din, which ravaged Palestine in 1491–2.

===Ottoman Empire===
In 1517, the village was incorporated into the Damascus Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine, and in 1596, Beit Lahia appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the nahiyah (subdistrict) of the Gaza Sanjak. It had a population of 70 Muslim households and paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards, fruit trees, goats and/or beehives.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the area of Beit Lahia experienced a significant process of settlement decline due to Bedouin pressures on local communities. The residents of abandoned villages moved to surviving settlements, but the land continued to be cultivated by neighboring villages.

In 1838, Edward Robinson noted &quot;Beit Lehia&quot; as a Muslim village located in the Gaza district.

In May 1863, Victor Guérin visited the village. He described it: 

An Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Beit Lahia had a population of 394, with a total of 118 houses, though the population count included men only.

In 1883 the Palestine Exploration Fund&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; described it as a &quot;small village with fine gardens and groves of large and ancient olives in the middle of the sand. It has a well to the south [..] There is a small mosque in the village.&quot;

===Mandatory Palestine===

In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bait Lahia had a population of 871 inhabitants, all Muslims, increasing by the 1931 census to 1,133, still all Muslim, in 223 houses.

In the 1945 statistics the population of Beit Lahiya consisted of 1,700 Muslims and the land area was 38,376 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 134 dunams were designated for citrus and bananas, 
1,765 for plantations and irrigable land, 15,185 for cereals, while 18 dunams were built-up areas.

===2004-2009===

On 4 January 2005, seven civilian residents of Beit Lahia, including six members of the same family, were killed, with the incident blamed on shelling by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of the agricultural area where they were working.

On 9 June 2006, eight civilians were killed by IDF shells while picnicking on the northern Gaza beach in Beit Lahia. The dead included seven members of the Ali Ghaliya family. The IDF disputed they were responsible. The town was a frequent target of airstrikes by Israel during the Gaza War (2008–2009) and has been a battlefield between Israel and Hamas.

The Ibrahim al-Maqadma Mosque missile strike occurred on 3 January as part of the Gaza War when an Israeli missile hit the Ibrahim al-Maqadna Mosque during evening prayer. Witnesses said over 200 Palestinians were praying inside at the time. At least 14 people, including six children, were killed, and many more than 60 wounded.

=== Israel-Hamas War (2023-Present) ===
In December 2023, the Israel Defence Forces began their offensive in Beit Lahia. Israel launched airstrikes on targets Hamas militants. Though they launched several assaults on the city, Israel did not fully occupy Beit Lahia. Rather, they had encircled the town and occupied the surrounding villages and farmland. 

In January 2024, Israel withdrew from the majority of North Gaza, and a ground connection between Palestinian-controlled Gaza City was re-established. Around this time, the Gaza Soup Kitchen was established in Beit Lahia to provide food to Palestinians at risk of famine. 

In April 2024, Israel withdrew all territories in the Gaza Strip except for the Netzarim Corridor, returning the northern villages such as As-Siafa back to Palestinian control until the second Israeli invasion of northern Gaza in May 2024 as a result of Hamas regrouping in some areas there. 

By June 2024, Gaza&#x27;s Civil Defence stated the destruction in Beit Lahia &quot;defies imagination&quot;.

On 29 October 2024, nearly 100 civilians, including over 20 children, were killed in a bombing of a five-story building by Israeli Forces. The Gaza Health Ministry reported over 90 casualties, including 25 children, with numerous individuals trapped under the rubble.

== Demography ==
Some of Beit Lahia&#x27;s residents trace their origins to Egypt, while others are Bedouins who migrated from the Mount Hebron area.

<text>The Canadian Party of Labour was a Marxist–Leninist political party in Canada. The CPL was not an electoral party, but a revolutionary party attempting to assemble a mass movement of workers and affiliated organizations who could lead a communist revolution. It was a fraternal party of the Progressive Labor Party in the United States until circa 1979, when the two organizations disagreed over the question of Quebec self-determination. The group was in existence from the late 1960s to the early 1980s and was most active in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec where a number of its members achieved office in the United Steel Workers of America and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.

The party described its decision-making process as &quot;democratic centralism&quot;:
Decisions are reached through broad discussion within the party. The clubs, city executives and national committee of the party are all involved in democratic discussion to develop and modify the lines.
Once a decision is arrived at we rely on centralism to see that it is carried out. What is important is that decisions are not only widely discussed, but that they are implemented as well. There&#x27;s nothing more undemocratic than an organization that decides nothing because it is always &quot;discussing&quot;, and therefore never implementing the will of the majority of its members.

<text>Alfred H. Hubbard is a U.S. Air Force veteran of the Korean War, anti-war and civil rights activist, former executive secretary of Vietnam Veterans Against the War and poet.

He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and entered the Air Force planning to make it his career. He was forced to take an early retirement in 1966 after suffering an injury during a plane crash. After leaving the service, he enrolled at the University of Washington and earned an undergraduate degree.

==Life==

=== Military ===
Hubbard enlisted in the United States Air Force in October 1952, reenlisted twice and was honorably discharged after 14 years of service. At the time of his discharge, he was an instructor/ flight engineer on C-124 Globemaster with the 7th Air Transport Squadron, McChord Air Force Base, Tacoma, Washington. Hubbard was awarded a Korean Service Medal, United Nations Medal, National Defense Medal, four Good Conduct Medals, Air Force Longevity Service Award, Air Force Unit Award and Air Force Expeditionary Medal. He was a flight engineer with the 22nd Troop Carrier Squadron at Tachikawa Air Force Base, Japan.

Hubbard was injured in a military plane crash and is registered with the VA with a service-connected disability rating of 60 per cent.

=== Anti-war and civil rights activism ===
In the fall of 1969, Hubbard joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and became an active organizer for the group.

During the publicity generated by the April, 1971 anti-war protest march on Washington DC, Hubbard made claims about his rank during interviews that he later admitted were false. He was introduced on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; as a decorated Air Force captain who had spent two years in South Vietnam. After receiving a tip that Hubbard was a sergeant and not a captain, NBC contacted Hubbard about the discrepancy. Hubbard admitted to lying about being an officer, and publicly acknowledged it when he appeared on the &quot;Today Show&quot; the following morning. Frank Jordan, then Washington Bureau Chief of NBC News, recalls Hubbard&#x27;s explanation for why he claimed to be an officer, &quot;He was convinced no one would listen to a black man who was also an enlisted man.&quot;

William Overend in the &quot;National Review&quot; reported that a Defense Department news release stated: &quot;Alfred H. Hubbard entered the Air Force in October 1952, re-enlisted twice and was honorably discharged in October 1966, when his enlistment expired. At the time of his discharge he was an instructor flight engineer on C-123 aircraft with the 7th Air Transport Squadron, McCord (&quot;sic&quot;) Air Force Base, Tacoma, Washington. There is no record of any service in Vietnam, but since he was an air crew member he could have been in Vietnam for brief periods during cargo loading, unloading operations or for crew rest purposes. His highest grade held was staff sergeant.&quot; Defense Department officials stressed it was still possible Hubbard could have served in Vietnam, flying in and out from Tacoma.

Historian and author of &quot;Home to War: A History of the Vietnam Veteran&#x27;s Movement&quot;, Gerald Nicosia commented on the Hubbard military record controversy: ... service people doing covert missions, such as rangers going across the border in Laos, into North Vietnam, etc., never had those actions put into their records. Al Hubbard was on similar covert missions, flying in a supply plane to the French when they were fighting the Viet Minh in the fifties. It doesn&#x27;t surprise me that those flights were not in his record. He did lie about being an officer, when he was a career sergeant, because the press kept paying more attention to his co-leader John Kerry, a decorated officer. Also, Hubbard never claimed to have been wounded in combat; his back was hurt when his plane crashed on a runway. When I interviewed him in 1992, he was on medical disability from the Air Force.

<text>Hilary Abner Herbert (March 12, 1834 – March 6, 1919) was Secretary of the Navy in the second administration of President Grover Cleveland. He also served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Alabama.

==Biography==
Herbert was born in Laurensville, South Carolina in 1834, and moved with his family to Greenville, Alabama in 1846. He was educated at the University of Alabama and the University of Virginia, where he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Eta chapter). He practiced law in Greenville until the Civil War.

Herbert entered the Confederate Army as a second lieutenant. He served as captain of the Greenville Guards, and was later promoted to the rank of colonel of the Eighth Regiment, Alabama Infantry. Herbert was wounded at the Battle of the Wilderness May 6, 1864.
After the war, Herbert returned to his law practice in Greenville, Alabama. He was elected to Congress in 1877 from Montgomery, Alabama as a Democrat. He served eight terms in this office. During his tenure as Congressman, Herbert was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs and was largely responsible for the increased appropriations which led to the revival of the United States Navy. However, he was among those who favored a more limited program than the one proposed by Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy in 1890, which called for 40 battleships; only four battleships were authorized as a result. Tracy had been influenced by the works of naval strategist Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, which called for a large fleet capable of offensive action. Herbert also became well known for leading a charge in Congress to reduce the funding of the United States Geological Survey, resulting in a public feud with paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh.

Herbert espoused racist views during his tenure in Congress, namely in his opposition to the Reconstruction Acts. Herbert vocally opposed the acts and any granting of suffrage to African Americans, speaking in congress and claiming African Americans were unfit to have such rights. He claimed &quot;the granting of universal suffrage to the Negro was the mistake of the nineteenth century&quot;.

In 1893, President Grover Cleveland appointed Herbert as Secretary of the Navy. By this time Herbert was able to muster support for an enlarged navy, despite the Depression of 1893, and brought the fleet to some level of preparedness for the Spanish–American War. Having converted to Mahan&#x27;s school of naval thought, five battleships (the and classes) and sixteen torpedo boats were authorized during Herbert&#x27;s tenure.

From 1897, when he left his Cabinet seat, to his death on March 6, 1919, six days before his 85th birthday, Herbert practiced law in Washington, D.C.

<text>The Burundian Civil War was a civil war in Burundi lasting from 1993 to 2005. The civil war was the result of longstanding ethnic divisions between the Hutu and the Tutsi ethnic groups. The conflict began following the first multi-party elections in the country since its independence from Belgium in 1962, and is seen as formally ending with the swearing-in of President Pierre Nkurunziza in August 2005. Children were widely used by both sides in the war. The estimated death toll stands at 300,000.

==Background==

Before becoming subject to European colonial rule, Burundi was governed by an ethnic Tutsi monarchy, similar to that of its neighbor Rwanda. German, and subsequently Belgian, colonial rulers found it convenient to govern through the existing power structure, perpetuating the dominance of the Tutsi minority over the ethnic Hutu majority. The Belgians generally identified the ethnic distinctions in Burundi and Rwanda with the following observations: the Twa who were short, the Hutu who were of medium height and the Tutsi who were tallest among them. Those individuals who owned more than ten cows were normally described as Tutsi.

Burundi became independent in 1962, breaking from a colonial federation with Rwanda. The independent country initially preserved its monarchy. The country&#x27;s first multi-party national elections were held in June 1993. These elections were immediately preceded by 25 years of Tutsi military regimes, beginning with Michel Micombero, who had led a successful coup in 1966 and replaced the monarchy with a presidential republic. Under the Micombero regime, the minority Tutsi generally dominated governance. In 1972, Hutu militants organized and carried out systematic attacks on ethnic Tutsi, with the declared intent of annihilating the whole group. The military regime responded with large-scale reprisals targeting Hutus. The total number of casualties was never established, but estimates for the Tutsi genocide and the reprisals on the Hutus together are said to exceed 100,000. As many refugees and asylum-seekers left the country for Tanzania and Rwanda.

The last of the coups was in 1987 and installed Tutsi officer Pierre Buyoya. Buyoya attempted to institute a number of reforms to ease state control over media and attempted to facilitate a national dialogue. Instead of helping the problem, these reforms instead served to inflame ethnic tensions as hope grew among the Hutu population that the Tutsi monopoly was at an end. Local revolts subsequently took place by Hutu peasants against several Tutsi leaders in northern Burundi; these Hutu militias killed hundreds of Tutsi families in the process. When the army came to quell the uprising, they in turn killed thousands of Hutu, leading to an estimated death toll of between 5,000 and 50,000. A low-level insurgency developed, and the first Hutu rebel groups were formed. Most notable among these were Party for the Liberation of the Hutu PeopleNational Forces of Liberation (&quot;Parti pour la libération du peuple HutuForces nationales de libération&quot;, PALIPEHUTU-FNL) and National Liberation Front (&quot;Front de libération nationale&quot;, FROLINA) which had been active from the 1980s. Of the two, PALIPEHUTU-FNL was much more powerful than FROLINA, but also suffered from more internal divisions. When a democratic transition began in Burundi in the early 1990s, the historical core leadership of PALIPEHUTU decided to cooperate with the Hutu-dominated Front for Democracy in Burundi (&quot;Front pour la démocratie au Burundi&quot;, FRODEBU) party and to peacefully participate in politics. Radical members of PALIPEHUTU-FNL disagreed with this decision. In contrast, FROLINA was firmly unified under the command of Joseph Karumba, but always remained a rather weak and marginal group.

==War==
=== 1993 coup and start of the conflict ===

After decades of military dictatorships, the parliamentary and presidential elections of June and July 1993 were the first ones in Burundi to be free and fair. FRODEBU decisively defeated the largely Tutsi Union for National Progress (&quot;Union pour le progrès national&quot;, UPRONA) of President Buyoya. Thus, FRODEBU leader Melchior Ndadaye became Burundi&#x27;s first democratically elected Hutu president. His tenure was wrought with problems from the beginning. Though PALIPEHUTU&#x27;s leadership decided to cooperate with Ndadaye&#x27;s new government, its military chief commander Kabora Kossan refused to end the insurgency. He and his followers split from PALIPEHUTU-FNL, and from then on simply called themselves &quot;National Forces of Liberation&quot; (FNL). For Kossan and his men the only option was to continue to fight until all Tutsi in Burundi were dead, removed or fully disempowered. Nevertheless, Ndadaye&#x27;s government was more threatened by Tutsi extremists than by radical Hutu groups: The latter were still rather weak, whereas the former controlled much of Burundi&#x27;s military. The political situation escalated when Tutsi extremist army officers launched a coup on 21 October. Supported by about half of the armed forces, the putschists murdered Ndadaye alongside other leading FRODEBU members, and declared a new regime. However, the military government was destabilized from the beginning, as it faced internal chaos and opposition by foreign powers.

As a result of President Ndadaye&#x27;s murder, violence and chaos broke out all over Burundi. Hutu attacked and killed many UPRONA supporters, most of them Tutsi but also some Hutu, while the putschists and allied Tutsi groups assaulted Hutu and FRODEBU sympathizers. Many civilians banded together in local militias to defend themselves, but these groups quickly became proactive as well, carrying out attacks and mass killings against each other. Urban street gangs, many of which had been biethnic before 1993, split along ethnic lines and began to work for extremist politicians. They received money and guns, and in return demonstrated, and murdered on the orders of the Tutsi and Hutu parties. An estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people died within a year about as many Hutu as Tutsi. As result of this chaos and international pressure, the putschists&#x27; regime collapsed, and power was returned to a FRODEBU-dominated civilian government.

The mass killings consequently abated, and the country was somewhat restabilized by the end of 1993. The coup and subsequent ethnic violence had however deeply affected the country. The Tutsi extremists in the military were still present, and though they had given up outright power for the time being, they continued to undermine the civilian government in hopes of regaining full power in the future. The Hutu rebels believed that the coup had proven the impossibility of negotiations, and regarded the new Hutu-dominated civilian government as mere &quot;stooges&quot; of the old regime. They consequently fully resumed their insurgency. Furthermore, radicals among the Tutsi civil society regarded FRODEBU as &quot;génocidaires&quot;, believing that the party had initiated the anti-Tutsi mass killings following the 1993 coup. They thus organized demonstrations and strikes to bring down what they considered a criminal regime.

=== Decline of state authority, 1994–1996 ===
A succession of bi-ethnic governments attempted to stabilize the country from early 1994 to July 1996, but all failed. Tutsi extremists in the army continued to undermine any attempt of FRODEBU to consolidate power, and parts of FRODEBU decided in early 1994 that compromise was no longer possible. Minister of Interior Léonard Nyangoma led a FRODEBU faction into armed rebellion, creating the National Council for the Defense of Democracy–Forces for the Defense of Democracy (&quot;Conseil national pour la défense de la démocratieForces pour la défense de la démocratie&quot;, CNDD-FDD). Nyangoma&#x27;s group consequently became the most important Hutu rebel group, though PALIPEHUTU-FNL and FROLINA continued to be active. PALIPEHUTU-FNL was weakened by further rifts, and would fracture into numerous smaller factions over disagreements on negotiations and leadership during the civil war. With the exception of the notably moderate CNDD-FDD, all Hutu militias embraced the radical Hutu Power ideology that desired for the extermination of all Burundian Tutsi. 

The Hutu insurgents received support by the neighboring countries of Zaire and Tanzania, both of which allowed the rebels to set up bases on their territories from where they could launch raids into Burundi. The reasons for which they supported the insurgents differed greatly: Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko believed that he could gain political leverage by harboring Rwandan and Burundian Hutu militants and refugees. They would suppress anti-Mobutu groups in Zaire, and give him something to bargain with the international community which sought to resolve the Great Lakes refugee crisis. In contrast, leading Tanzanian statesman Julius Nyerere wanted the region to be stabilized and pacified, and believed that the existence of Burundi and Rwanda as independent states posed a security problem by itself. Ultimately, he desired for these states to be annexed into Tanzania, therefore unifying all territory that had formerly comprised German East Africa. In the short term however, Nyerere believed that peace and order could only be achieved in Burundi through the inclusion of Hutus in the Burundian government and military.

While the country further descended into civil war, the political situation in Burundi deteriorated. Ndadaye&#x27;s successor Cyprien Ntaryamira was assassinated in the same plane crash with Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana on 6 April 1994. This act marked the beginning of the Rwandan genocide, while in Burundi, the death of Ntaryamira exacerbated the violence and unrest, although there was no general massacre. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was installed to a four-year presidency on April 8, but the security situation further declined. The influx of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees and the activities of armed Hutu and Tutsi groups further destabilized the government. A coalition government, formed by the peaceful FRODEBU faction and UPRONA in September 1994, proved to be too weak and fractured to actually govern the country. With the civil authorities factually defunct, the military effectively held control of &quot;what little state power remained&quot;.

At the same time, the power of non-state actors increased. Though many self-defense groups had been disbanded after 1993, others transformed into larger ethnic militias. These groups included unofficial paramilitary wings of Hutu and Tutsi parties, independent extremist militias, and militant youth gangs. Notable Tutsi factions included the Party for National Recovery&#x27;s (&quot;Parti pour le redressement national&quot;, PARENA) &quot;Imbogaraburundi&quot; (&quot;those-who-will-bring-Burundi-back&quot;), the People&#x27;s Reconciliation Party&#x27;s (&quot;Parti de la réconciliation des personnes&quot;, PRP) &quot;Sans Echecs&quot; (&quot;the unfailing ones&quot;), and urban youth gangs like &quot;Sans Défaite&quot; (&quot;the undefeated&quot;), &quot;Sans Pitié&quot; (&quot;the pitiless ones&quot;), &quot;Sans Capote&quot; (&quot;those-who-do-not-wear-condoms&quot;) which acted as forces for hire for various extremist Tutsi parties. Hutu parties like FRODEBU and FDD also raised supportive militias, &quot;Inziraguhemuka&quot; (&quot;those-who-did-not-betray&quot;) and &quot;Intagoheka&quot; (&quot;those-who-never-sleep&quot;) respectively, while the Hutu street gang &quot;Chicago Bulls&quot; from Bujumbura managed to expand into a small army. These militias undermined attempts by the government to restore peace. The Tutsi militias were often trained and armed by extremist factions in the Burundian military. With aid by the army, they defeated a number of Hutu militias, but also terrorized as well as displaced many Hutu civilians at Bujumbura and other cities in 1995/96.

Furthermore, the Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (&quot;Front Patriotique Rwandais&quot;, RPF) defeated the Hutu regime of Rwanda in July 1994, ending the Rwandan Civil War and genocide. The military and paramilitary forces of old Rwandan Hutu regime (Ex-FAR/ALiR and Interahamwe) subsequently fled across the border into Zaire. There, they rebuilt their strength and launched an insurgency against the RPF. The Burundian CNDD-FDD and PALIPEHUTU-FNL soon allied themselves with the Rwandan Hutu factions which consequently aided them in attacking the Burundian military. And despite the CNDD-FDD’s denial of these links, Filip Reyntjens assessed how northern Burundi’s situation made Rwandan and Burundian Hutu rebel groups “objective allies” for geopolitical convenience, given an interest “in effectively controlling this area which could become a major base for an invasion of Rwanda by Rwandan exiles.”

This situation, and the decline of state authority in Burundi, greatly alarmed the RPF-led government of Rwanda. The RPF feared that the collapse of the Burundian government would lead not only to the influx of possibly 500,000 Tutsi refugees into Rwanda, but also provide a new haven to the Rwandan Hutu insurgents. The Rwandan government thus began providing aid to the Burundian government from 1995. Rwandan troops would repeatedly cross the border, and attack Hutu refugee camps which harbored rebel forces in coordination with the Burundian military and local Tutsi militias. This development, according to Reyntjens, gave rise to the “conviction that transnational Hutu and Tutsi alliances fight each other.”

=== Buyoya&#x27;s presidency ===
The power-sharing political system of Hutu presidency and Tutsi military operated until 1996, when Tutsi Pierre Buyoya replaced the Hutu president in a coup, ostensibly to restore order. As the government had already been under &quot;de facto&quot; military control by this point, the coup mostly cemented the status quo. Upon assuming power, Buyoya took action to solve the war peacefully. He brought the radical Tutsi mostly under control, forcing their militias to integrate into the military or to be disbanded. Buyoya also attempted to open negotiations with the insurgents. Despite this, the coup also strengthened the Hutu rebel groups, as Buyoya&#x27;s regime was regarded as illegitimate, and neighboring countries imposed an embargo on Burundi to protest against the coup. The civil war consequently escalated in intensity. Hutu rebels grew in power and killed about 300 Tutsi in a major attack on 20 July 1996. The increasing activity of the Hutu rebels in Burundi worried the Rwandan government, and influenced its decision to launch the First Congo War in late 1996 to overthrow President Mobutu of Zaire. By doing so, Rwanda hoped to eliminate Zaire as haven for various Hutu rebel groups; the CNDD-FDD had for example set up major bases at Uvira and Bukavu in eastern Zaire from where it launched raids into Burundi. Although Rwanda successfully overthrew Mobutu in a matter of months and replaced him with Laurent-Désiré Kabila, CNDD-FDD rebels still managed to significantly expand their operations in 1997. Infiltrating Bururi Province and Makamba Province in Burundi&#x27;s south, they even attacked Rutovu, Buyoya&#x27;s home town and center of Burundi&#x27;s Tutsi elite at the time. In fact, at least elements of the new Congolese government under Laurent-Désiré&#x27;s son Joseph Kabila came to support the Burundian insurgents by the early 2000s just as Mobutu had done it previously.

In response to the deteriorating security situation, the government opted to organize a new paramilitary initiative. The military forced civilians to organize unarmed patrols to guard their communities against rebels. Though the state authorities claimed that these self-defense groups consisted of volunteers, civilians were generally coerced with threats of violence or fines. Most of the civilian militiamen were also poor Hutu, while Tutsi and wealthy or well connected Hutu were generally exempted of the patrol duties. As a result of demands by Tutsi extremist politicians, the military also set up a special, armed training program for Tutsi militiamen; Hutu were not allowed to join this training. As these initiatives failed to halt the growth of the rebel movements, the Burundian military eventually decided to set up a new militia in Cibitoke Province, which was initially simply known as &quot;the young men&quot; (&quot;les jeunes&quot; or &quot;abajeunes&quot;). In contrast to previous self-defense groups which were either unarmed or dominated by Tutsi, the &quot;abajeunes&quot; were both armed as well as mostly Hutu. They consisted of ex-rebels and former civilian patrolmen who had proven themselves to be trustworthy. Trained, armed and supplied by the military, the &quot;abajeunes&quot; were a success. The program was thus expanded to the entire country; the &quot;abajeunes&quot; in southern Burundi soon became known as the &quot;Guardians of the Peace&quot;. Numbering 3,000 fighters by late 1997, they were decisive in keeping the insurgents at bay. Nevertheless, the number of war casualties further increased in 1998.

In 1998, Buyoya and the opposition-led Hutu parliament reached an agreement to sign a transitional constitution, and Buyoya was sworn in as president. Formal peace talks with the rebels began at Arusha on 15 June 1998. The talks proved to be extremely difficult. Tanzanian ex-President Julius Nyerere acted as chief negotiator, and attempted to use caution and patience to achieve a solution. Upon Nyerere&#x27;s natural death in 1999, Nelson Mandela assumed responsibility for the peace talks. He and other heads of states in the region increased the pressure on Burundi&#x27;s political leadership, pushing them to accept a government with participation of the rebel groups. Meanwhile, the civil war continued unabated, despite the efforts of the international community to facilitate the peace process. Though 1999 saw a reduction of fighting, the war again grew in intensity during the following two years. The Burundian military conducted a major offensive between October and December 2000, attempting to clear the Tenga forest near Bujumbura of insurgents. Though killing many rebel fighters, the operation was a failure, and the Tenga forest remained an insurgent stronghold. After bitter negotiations, an agreement was finally reached which established a transitional government, where the presidency and vice-presidency would be rotated every 18 months, sharing power between the Hutus and Tutsis. While the Burundian government and three Tutsi groups signed the Arusha Accords ceasefire accord in August 2000, two leading Hutu rebel groups refused to participate, and the fighting continued. The Arusha talks closed on November 30, 2000. Twenty Tutsis and one British woman were killed on 28 December 2000, in the Titanic Express massacre.

As the Arusha Accords were gradually implemented, severe challenges remained. Several times, the peace process almost broke down. Even though some moderate Tutsi parties had signed the peace deal, they remained opposed to some of its provisitions. Many Tutsi extremists refused to accept the Arusha Accords at all and refused any deal with the Hutu rebels. On 18 April 2001, an attempted coup against Buyoya failed. The putschists had wanted to prevent the power-sharing deal from coming into effect. A group of extremist Tutsis also attempted to revive the &quot;Puissance Auto-défense-Amasekanya&quot; (PA-Amasekanya) ethnic militia in mid-2000 to resist the peace agreement, but the leaders of this faction were promptly jailed. On 23 July 2001, it was agreed that the transitional government would be led by Buyoya for 18 months, followed by Domitien Ndayizeye, a Hutu and FRODEBU leader. Furthermore, a reform of the Burundian military would be implemented as soon as possible; the latter was especially contentious among the Tutsi.

The transitional government was implemented in October 2001. Buyoya was sworn in as internationally recognized president in November, while the first South African peacekeepers arrived in Burundi. Despite this, the main Hutu rebel groups, CNDD-FDD and FNL, still refused to sign a ceasefire agreement. Instead, fighting intensified, as the FNL launched numerous attacks around Bujumbura. Some 300 boys were kidnapped from Museuma College on November 9, 2001. The army responded by launching an offensive against the rebel bases in Tenga forest in December, claiming to have killed 500 insurgents. The September 9, 2002 Itaba massacre left hundreds of unarmed civilians dead.

After being promised to be included in the new government, two wings of CNDD-FDD finally agreed to a ceasefire and joined the Arusha agreement on 3 December 2002. The PALIPEHUTU-FNL refused to enter negotiations with the government and continued its struggle.

===Presidency of Ndayizeye===
On April 9, 2003, the force headquarters of the African Union Mission in Burundi was established in Bujumbura under South African Maj. Gen. Sipho Binda. As previously agreed, Buyoya stepped down, and Ndayizeye became President on 30 April 2003. In the following months, the CNDD-FDD faction of Pierre Nkurunziza was gradually integrated into the transitional government. A power-sharing deal was signed on 8 October 2003, and Nkurunziza was appointed Minister of State in charge of good governance and the general inspection of the state. On 18 October 2003, it was announced that the African Union Mission had reached full strength: 1,483 South Africans, 820 Ethiopians, and 232 personnel from Mozambique. As the Arusha Accords were implemented, the peace process made substantial progress. The reform of the military proved remarkably successful, and the integration of CNDD-FDD fighters went well. In contrast to earlier attempts to ensure peace which had been sabotaged by army extremists, most of the military had become wary of the constant civil war by the early 2000s. Its Tutsi and Hutu troops proved to be willing to stay loyal to the new government. The United Nations Operation in Burundi also helped to stabilize the country.

In spite of these successes, the war had not yet ended. The FNL remained the only active rebel group, but it was still a capable fighting force and continued its attacks. In July 2003, a rebel raid on Bujumbura left 300 dead and 15,000 displaced. On December 29, 2003, Archbishop Michael Courtney, the papal nuncio for the country, was murdered. Confronted by the newly unified Burundian military and the international peacekeepers, as well as a war-wary population, the abilities of the FNL to wage an insurgency gradually whittled down. By late 2004, it had just about 1,000 fighters left, and its area of operations had been reduced to just Bujumbura Rural Province. In August 2004, the FNL claimed responsibility for killing 160 Congolese Tutsi refugees in a United Nations camp at Gatumba near the Congo border in Burundi. The attack was strongly condemned by the U.N. Security Council, which issued a statement of outrage at the fact that &quot;most of the victims were women, children and babies who were shot dead and burned in their shelters&quot;. The FNL attempted to deflect criticism by claiming that the victims had been Banyamulenge militants, but the Gatumba massacre proved to be a propaganda disaster. The group was consequently labelled as &quot;terrorist&quot; both internationally and in Burundi, weakening it politically. Confronted with its declining fortunes, the FNL signalled that it was willing to negotiate an end of its insurgency.

=== Final peace process ===
In 2005, many developments were made in the peace process. The president signed a law in January 2005 to initiate a new national army, consisting of Tutsi military forces and all but one of the Hutu rebel groups. The Constitution was approved by voters in a referendum—marking the first time Burundians had voted since 1994. They voted again in July during the parliamentary elections, postponed from November 2004, in which &quot;the Government of Burundi and the Independent National Electoral Commission conducted a sound election, carried out in an atmosphere of peace and security.&quot; The Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD) ended up winning the parliamentary elections. Several months later, Pierre Nkurunziza from the Hutu FDD group was elected as president by the two Hutu-dominated houses of parliament.

After 12 years of living with a midnight-to-dawn curfew, Burundians were free to stay out late when the curfew was lifted on April 15, 2006, for the first time since 1993. This signified the most stable point in Burundian civil affairs since the assassination of Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye and the beginning of the civil war.

Matters continued to look promising after Burundi&#x27;s last rebel group, the FNL, signed a ceasefire deal in Tanzania, &quot;solidifying the end of a 12-year civil war.&quot; As part of the agreement, members of the FNL were to be assembled, demobilized, and integrated into the national army. Dissident parts of the FNL, most notably the National Liberation Forces – Icanzo (FNL–Icanzo), continued their insurgency, however, and only surrendered later on. In mid-April 2008, FNL rebels shelled the then-capital, Bujumbura, while fighting killed at least 33.

== Use of child soldiers ==
Children were recruited and used extensively by both sides during the civil war of 1993–2005. The Burundian military regularly conscripted children between the ages of 7 and 16 for its militias, most importantly the Guardians of the Peace. It would threaten the parents with violence or fines to hand over their sons to the army, and the child soldiers themselves were often beaten during training. Thousands of child soldiers fought for the government in the civil war, though the exact number is not known. Hundreds were killed in combat. The Hutu rebels were also known to deploy large numbers of child soldiers; hundreds of child soldiers were in the FNL by 2004. As the Guardians of the Peace recruited ex-rebels into their ranks, some rebel child soldiers also fought for the government after their surrender or capture.

The recruitment of child soldiers by the military had been reduced by 2000. After the peace agreements brought the conflict to an end in 2005, the new constitution committed to not using children in direct combat. The parties to the conflict no longer recruited children in large numbers, but many remained active in the FNL, which had denounced the peace accord. By 2006, a reintegration program organized by UNICEF had led to the release of 3,000 children from the military and armed groups. According to Child Soldiers International:The majority of those [children] who took part in the program returned to farm and fish in their local communities, but nearly 600 returned to school. Some 1,800 former child soldiers received occupational training. Health care was provided for those with special needs and psychosocial support was provided through individual and group meetings.

==Truth and Reconciliation Commission==

In 2014 the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to investigate crimes committed during ethnic violence since independence in 1962, overseen by Pierre Claver Ndayicariye.

<text>Norman Fitzroy Maclean (December 23, 1902August 2, 1990) was an American professor at the University of Chicago who, following his retirement, became a major figure in American literature. Maclean is best known for his Hemingwayesque writing, his collection of novellas &quot;A River Runs Through It and Other Stories&quot; (1976), and the creative nonfiction book &quot;Young Men and Fire&quot; (1992).

==Family origins==
In his novella, &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, Maclean wrote that his paternal ancestors were from the Isle of Mull, in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. According to his son, however, their paternal ancestors were Gaelic speaking Presbyterians and from the Isle of Coll, which is &quot;located about seven miles west of the Clan MacLean stronghold, the Isle of Mull&quot;.

Maclean&#x27;s great-grandfather, Laughlan Maclean, was a carpenter who, accompanied by his wife, Elizabeth Campbell, emigrated to Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in 1821, before they settled on a homestead in Pictou County.

Maclean&#x27;s father, Rev. John Norman Maclean, was born on July 28, 1862, to Laughlan&#x27;s son Norman and his wife Mary MacDonald on the family farm in Marshy Hope, Pictou County, Nova Scotia where much of the community spoke Canadian Gaelic. John Maclean showed signs of academic promise and trained for the ministry first at Pictou Academy, where academic records refer to him as &quot;J.N. Mclean of Glenbard&quot;, Maclean&#x27;s father completed his education at Dalhousie College in Halifax and at Manitoba College in Winnipeg. MacLean&#x27;s parents met while his father was riding circuit in the summers among the many small Presbyterian congregations in the pioneer communities of the Pembina Valley Region of Manitoba. His mother, Clara Davidson was a schoolmarm. Maclean&#x27;s maternal grandfather, John Davidson, was a Presbyterian immigrant from Northern England who had first settled near Argenteuil, Laurentides, Quebec, where his daughter Clara was born. Finding the farmland there poor, John Davidson and his family moved west by oxcart and settled on a homestead at New Haven near Manitou, Manitoba. During their courtship, Clara often accompanied John Maclean while he was riding circuit. In 1893, John Maclean completed advanced studies at San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo, California, and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. John Maclean and Clara were married in Pembina, Manitoba, on August 1, 1893.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Maclean was born at Clarinda, Iowa, on December 23, 1902, and was the son of Clara Evelyn (; 1873–1952) and the Rev. John Norman Maclean (1862–1941). Maclean and his younger brother, Paul Davidson MacLean (1906–1938) were homeschooled by their father until 1913. Maclean recalled about being homeschooled by his father, &quot;I think the most important thing is that he read aloud to us. He was a minister, and every morning after breakfast we had what was called family worship. We&#x27;d all sit with our breakfast chairs pulled back from the table and he would read to us from the Bible or from some religious poet. He was a very good reader... that was very good for me because in doing that, he would bring out the rhythms of the Bible. That reading instilled in me this great love of rhythm in language.&quot; His father also passed on to both of his sons a passion for fly fishing which he had begun and developed in Clarinda. As a child, Maclean also often witnessed his father, whose first language was the distinctive Nova Scotia dialect of the Scottish Gaelic language, working hard to hide all traces of a foreign accent by learning proper diction and elocution.

In 1909, his family relocated to Missoula, Montana, at the invitation of its Presbyterian church elders. The following years considerably influenced and inspired Maclean&#x27;s writings, appearing prominently in the short story &quot;The Woods, Books, and Truant Officers&quot; (1977) and the semi-autobiographical novella &quot;A River Runs Through It and Other Stories&quot; (1976).

===Forest Service===
When Maclean was 14 years old, he found work with the United States Forest Service in the Bitterroot National Forest of northwestern Montana. The novella &quot;USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky&quot; and the story &quot;Black Ghost&quot; in &quot;Young Men and Fire&quot; (1992) are semi-fictionalized accounts of these experiences.

===Dartmouth===

Maclean later attended Dartmouth College, where he served as editor-in-chief of the humor magazine the &quot;Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern&quot;. His successor as editor-in-chief was Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss who, Maclean described as &quot;the craziest guy I ever met.&quot; He was also a member of the Sphinx and Beta Theta Pi. 

During a 1986 interview, Maclean described the enormous gratitude he felt for having been able to attend creative writing classes taught at Dartmouth by the poet Robert Frost. Maclean stated that he learned an enormous amount from Frost, which he carried with him for the rest of his life. During the same interview, Maclean recalled that his lifelong admiration for and emulation of the writing style of Ernest Hemingway also began during his time at Dartmouth.

Maclean received his Bachelor of Arts in 1924 and chose to remain in Hanover, New Hampshire, to serve as an instructor until 1926, a time he recalled in &quot;This Quarter I Am Taking McKeon: A Few Remarks on the Art of Teaching&quot;.

===Personal life===

Maclean met his future wife, Jessie Burns, during a December party in the Helena valley. They were returning home after the party with another couple in Jessie&#x27;s car, when a blizzard descended and the car&#x27;s radiator froze. He tried pouring water in, only to have the water freeze as well. He then started hiking through the blizzard to seek help but soon found that the car had caught up with him, as the cold had prevented the engine from overheating. He felt foolish, but Jessie always considered him the hero of the blizzard. He and Burns married on September 24, 1931, and had two children: a daughter Jean (born in 1942), now a lawyer, and a son, John Norman Maclean (born in 1943) who became a journalist and author.

Following their marriage, Jessie handled the family&#x27;s finances and wrote all the checks. Jessie&#x27;s &quot;open personality&quot; made her a lot of friends at the University of Chicago. It was often said of her in later years, &quot;She was the only one who&#x27;d talk to the young faculty wives.&quot; During a 1986 interview, Maclean recalled, &quot;I love Chicago. My wife was very wonderful in helping me come to feel that. I was very provincial in a lot of ways. She was gay and loved life wherever she lived. She really worked me over in our early years in Chicago. I was insolent and provincial about that city. She made me see how beautiful it was, made me see the geometric and industrial and architectural beauty.&quot; Dr. Sidney Schulman later said of Jessie&#x27;s role at the university, &quot;Jessie knew what was to be said. She said less than she knew, but what she said was enough and she said it with humor, with literary allusions and with simplicity. She came to be a sort of housemother. In being this, she was unaware of it - no self-satisfied awareness that what she was doing was noble. She was not playacting. It was part of her existence.&quot; Jessie died in 1968, of emphysema and cancer of the esophagus, the result of decades of chain smoking.

Maclean&#x27;s family always led two lives, according to his son. One life was during the summers at the log cabin built by Maclean&#x27;s father near Seeley Lake, Montana. The other life took place in Chicago during the academic year.

Maclean gave up typing and wrote almost everything, including his books, &quot;in a cramped longhand that generations of typists at the University and elsewhere prided themselves on learning to decipher.&quot;

===Murder of Paul MacLean===
Maclean&#x27;s younger brother, Paul Davidson MacLean, similarly graduated from Dartmouth and became well known as an investigative journalist who fearlessly exposed political corruption in the state capital of Helena, Montana, by politicians linked to the powerful Anaconda Copper Mining Company. Paul later worked alongside Maclean and his wife at the University of Chicago during the Jazz Age and the Depression era. Paul had talents in writing and fly fishing but became an alcoholic, addicted gambler, notorious brawler and a womanizer. Maclean suggested all of these addictions and behaviors had a very long generational history and could be traced all the way back to the Maclean family&#x27;s earliest origins among the Gaels of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Despite repeated attempts by his family to help, Paul rejected all overtures.

On the early morning of May 2, 1938, Paul was murdered. He was attacked and brutally beaten at Sixty-Third Street and Drexel Avenue in Chicago. According to the testimony of an eyewitness, two men drove away afterwards in a car. Paul was taken to nearby Woodlawn Hospital where he never regained consciousness and died at 1:20 pm the same day. According to Maclean and statements made to the press by Detective Sergeant Ignatius Sheehan, evidence indicated Paul fought back savagely against his assailants and sold his life very dearly, so much so that the medical examiner found nearly all the bones in his right hand to have been broken during his last fight. Following a homicide investigation led by Sheehan, Chicago Police Department Captain Mark Boyle testified at the Cook County Coroner&#x27;s inquest that he believed Paul&#x27;s murder to be a mugging gone bad, which remains the official police explanation. Another widely held theory at the time was that Paul&#x27;s murderers were linked to organized crime and the murder was over Maclean&#x27;s refusal or inability to pay them an illegal gambling or loansharking debt. No arrests were ever made and the case remains unsolved.

Maclean accompanied his brother&#x27;s casket, alone, on an overnight train trip from Chicago to Montana. After the funeral, Maclean spent several weeks of compassionate leave with his parents at their family&#x27;s cabin at Seeley Lake.

Maclean&#x27;s father, who was old enough to remember the robber barons of the Gilded Age, was understandably very skeptical of the Chicago Police Department&#x27;s official explanation for his son&#x27;s murder and asked Maclean, &quot;Do you think it was just a stick-up and foolishly he tried to fight his way out? You know what I mean -- that it wasn&#x27;t connected to anything in his past?&quot; Maclean replied that the Chicago Police Department didn&#x27;t know and that neither did he. Maclean later wrote that his father aged rapidly following Paul&#x27;s murder and that, &quot;Like many Scottish ministers before him, he had to derive what comfort he could from the faith that his son had died fighting.&quot; A few years later, before his death in 1941, Maclean&#x27;s father brought up Maclean&#x27;s fondness for writing nonfiction and advised, &quot;After you have finished your true stories sometime, why don&#x27;t you make up a story and the people to go with it? Only then will you understand what happened and why. It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us.&quot;

During visits to the cabin at Seeley Lake in later years, his son often heard Maclean calling out over the lake in the evenings, &quot;Paul! Paul!&quot;

===University of Chicago===
Maclean began graduate studies in English at the University of Chicago in 1928 and earned a PhD in 1940.

Like his contemporary C.S. Lewis, Maclean acquired a reputation for personal magnetism and for making the writings of difficult Medieval authors like François Rabelais and Geoffrey Chaucer come alive in the lecture hall. One of his students later said, &quot;Maclean is one of the best liked guys around this place. He is best remembered because when we were freshmen we used to come to class only when he lectured. His classes were always overrun.&quot; According to another of his students, the poet Marie Borroff, Maclean was considered a unique figure at the university because he came from a &quot;wilderness outpost&quot;, was a gifted marksman with a rifle, played a rough game of handball and was every bit as much of an expert on George Armstrong Custer as he was on Aristotle.

During World War II, Maclean declined a commission in the Office of Naval Intelligence to serve as dean of students. During the war, he also served as director of the Institute on Military Studies and co-authored &quot;Manual of Instruction in Military Maps and Aerial Photographs&quot;.

Maclean eventually became the William Rainey Harper Professor in the Department of English and taught the Romantic poets and Shakespeare. &quot;Every year I said to myself, &#x27;You better teach this bastard so you don&#x27;t forget what great writing is like.&#x27; I taught him technically, two whole weeks for the first scene from &quot;Hamlet&quot;. I&#x27;d spend the first day on just the line, &#x27;Who&#x27;s there?&#x27;&quot;

U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens took a poetry class taught by Maclean at the University of Chicago and later called him, &quot;the teacher to whom I am most indebted.&quot; Maclean received the Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Awards for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1941 and 1973.

Maclean also wrote two scholarly articles, &quot;From Action to Image: Theories of the Lyric in the Eighteenth Century&quot; and &quot;Episode, Scene, Speech, and Word: The Madness of Lear&quot;, the latter describing a theory of tragedy that he revisited in his later work.

===Retirement and Literary Career===

After his retirement in 1973, Maclean began, as his children Jean and John had often encouraged him, to write down the stories he liked to tell.

As his father had urged, Maclean wrote an iconic and slightly fictionalized novella about his relationship with his parents and, even more so, with his brother Paul, beginning with their childhood together in Missoula and particularly focusing on the last summer in Montana before Paul&#x27;s murder in 1938. According to his son, John Norman Maclean, &quot;The portrait Norman managed to create in &quot;A River Runs through It&quot; gave Paul a lasting afterlife as the charming rebel, doomed but beautiful and gifted with a fly rod. He was forever the younger brother who struggled for an independent life and went down fighting. Norman&#x27;s vision of him, though, brought the consolation of shared experience, taken to an eloquent level, to a host of brothers and sisters who have reached out to wayward siblings only to see them twist and dodge away as Paul did.&quot; The resulting novella was included with two other stories in the book &quot;A River Runs Through It and Other Stories&quot;. Pete Dexter, in a 1981 profile of Maclean in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, described the novella, &quot;It is a story about Maclean and his brother, Paul, who was beaten to death with a gun butt in 1938. It is about not understanding what you love, about not being able to help. It is the truest story I ever read; it might be the best written. And to this day it won&#x27;t leave me alone.&quot;

The second story in the book is &quot;Logging and Pimping and &#x27;Your pal, Jim&#x27;.&quot; The third story describes Maclean&#x27;s employment as a teenager by the United States Forest Service and is titled &quot;USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky.&quot; In 1976, &quot;A River Runs Through It and Other Stories&quot; became the first work of fiction ever published by the University of Chicago Press. The book received enthusiastic reviews, with &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; calling it a &quot;stunning debut.&quot; It was nominated by a selection committee to receive the Pulitzer Prize in Letters in 1977 but no Pulitzer award was made in the category that year.

In a May 26, 1976, letter to Nick Lyons, Maclean explained that &quot;Retrievers Good and Bad&quot; had been the first story he attempted after retirement, that it was about his brother, and that he considered it &quot;both a moral and artistic failure.&quot; Despite his misgivings about the essay, Maclean published &quot;Retrievers Good and Bad&quot; in &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1977. That year another essay, &quot;The Woods, Books, and Truant Officers,&quot; was published in Chicago magazine. Both essays were anthologized along with a selection of other short writings by Maclean, two interviews and &quot;essays in appreciation and criticism&quot; in the 1988 volume &quot;Norman Maclean&quot;. They were collected again in &quot;The Norman Maclean Reader&quot; (2008).

In a 1986 interview, Maclean expressed contempt for New York City publishers: &quot;Not until recently have the Western writers ever gotten a good break from the publishers in New York.&quot; He recalled that &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; had been rejected by Alfred A. Knopf and that when Knopf later approached him about his second book, &quot;I really told those bastards off&quot; in a letter that was &quot;probably one of the best things I ever wrote.&quot; That 1981 &quot;middle finger of a letter,&quot; to Knopf editor Charles Elliott, concludes, &quot;if the situation ever arose when Alfred A. Knopf was the only publishing house remaining in the world and I was the sole surviving author, that would mark the end of the world of books.&quot; In that 1986 interview MacLean added, &quot;I had the good fortune of having a dream come true. I&#x27;m sure every rejected writer must dream of a time when he&#x27;s written something that was rejected which turns out to be quite successful, so that all the publishers who rejected him are now coming around and kissing his ass at high noon, and he can tell them where to go.&quot;

By the time Maclean&#x27;s &quot;A River Runs through It and Other Stories&quot; was published, he had begun researching a book about the 13 smokejumpers who lost their lives fighting the 1949 Mann Gulch Forest Fire. Maclean&#x27;s letters, some of them gathered in &quot;The Norman Maclean Reader&quot;, &quot;attest to his periodic doubts as well as his determination to finish and publish the large manuscript he initially called &#x27;The Great Blow-Up,&#x27; and later &quot;Young Men and Fire&quot;,&quot; according to the &quot;Reader&quot;&#x27;s editor, O. Alan Weltzien. That book was published posthumously in 1992 as &quot;Young Men and Fire&quot; by the University of Chicago Press and won the National Book Critics Circle Award.

==Death==
During his last years, Maclean collaborated with several others in attempting to adapt &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; into a screenplay. He also struggled to finish &quot;Young Men and Fire&quot; as his health declined, and because &quot;at the end he lived more for telling and retelling the story — for getting it right — than for publishing it.&quot; In late May, 1987, he suffered a serious fall at home, lying incapacitated for several hours before calling for help. It &quot;marked &#x27;the beginning of the end for him,&#x27;&quot; and resulted in cognitive decline that forced him to stop work on the unfinished Mann Gulch manuscript.
Maclean died in Chicago on August 2, 1990, at the age of 87. He left his manuscript of &quot;Young Men and Fire&quot; unfinished. At his own request, Maclean&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes were scattered over the mountains of Montana.

==Legacy==
In 1991, a renovated church retirement home was turned into an undergraduate dormitory on the University of Chicago campus named Maclean House. Maclean House&#x27;s mascot was the &quot;Stormin&#x27; Normans&quot; in honor of its namesake. The dorm was closed after the 2015–2016 academic year, subsequently sold and turned into apartments.

In 2008, the University of Chicago Press published a new compendium of unpublished and some previously published works, &quot;The Norman Maclean Reader&quot;. The anthology included parts of a never-finished book about George Armstrong Custer and the Battle of the Little Bighorn which Maclean had worked on from 1959 to 1963. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; gave the book a respectful review in the summer of 2008, remarking, &quot;Readers of the two earlier books will find, as Weltzien [Alan Weltzien, the book&#x27;s editor] phrases it, &#x27;new biographical insights into one of the most remarkable and unexpected careers in American letters.&#x27;&quot;

In May of 2024, University of Washington Press published &quot;Norman Maclean: A Life of Letters and Rivers&quot; by Rebecca McCarthy, his friend and former University of Chicago student.

<text>Paul Hamilton Hayne (January 1, 1830 – July 6, 1886) was a poet, critic, and editor from the American South.

==Biography==
Paul Hamilton Hayne was born in Charleston, South Carolina on January 1, 1830. After losing his father as a young child, Hayne was reared by his mother in the home of his prosperous and prominent uncle, Robert Y. Hayne, who was an orator and politician who served in the United States Senate.

Hayne was educated in Charleston city schools and graduated from the College of Charleston in 1852. He began the practice of law but soon abandoned it in order to pursue his literary interests and ambitions. Hayne served in the Confederate army in 1861 and remained in the army until his health failed after four months, where he served as aide-de-camp to South Carolina Governor Francis Pickens. He lost all of his possessions — including his house and an extensive library — when Charleston was bombarded in 1862. In 1863, Hayne moved his family to Grovetown, Georgia, a wooded area about 16 miles from Augusta, Georgia. Here, Hayne lived and worked until his death in 1886. Grovetown was also where his career as a literary critic and magazine editor began. He contributed to important magazines of the South during his era, including the &quot;Charleston Literary Gazette&quot;, the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;, the &quot;Home Journal&quot;, and &quot;Southern Bivouac&quot;. Hayne was also instrumental with Southern novelist William Gilmore Simms in the founding of &quot;Russell&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which Hayne edited.

Hayne is also noteworthy for his friendship with fellow Southern poet Henry Timrod, whom Hayne helped with both his life and his career. Timrod was frail and ill throughout his life with tuberculosis, and Hayne helped to provide financially for Timrod and his wife and young son. Most importantly for literature and history, Hayne preserved Timrod&#x27;s poems and edited them into a collection that was published in 1872 and that presented such historically important poems as &quot;The Cotton Boll&quot; and &quot;Ode Sung On The Occasion Of Decorating The Graves Of The Confederate Dead&quot;. Timrod now has the greater reputation as a poet, while Hayne is known more for his role as an editor and literary critic than as a poet. Timrod has continued to influence other modern Southern writers, including the poet Allen Tate, whose most famous poem, &quot;Ode to the Confederate Dead&quot;, owes a great deal to Timrod&#x27;s similarly titled poem.

Hayne had a friendship also with Sidney Lanier. Though the two never met, they corresponded, and advised each other--Hayne suggested to Lanier that he leave the medievalism of his poem &quot;The Jacquerie&quot; alone and turn to Southern topics, and Lanier helping Hayne to strive for &quot;more simplicity and directness in his poems&quot;.

Hayne died at his home, Copse Hill, at Grovetown, Georgia, on July 6, 1886. His papers are variously preserved in the libraries of the College of Charleston, Duke University, the University of Virginia, and the South Carolina Historical Society.

==Writings==
Hayne&#x27;s first volume of poetry, &quot;Poems&quot;, was published in 1855 by Ticknor and Fields; not every critic loved it, but it drew attention from national magazines, more so than any of his later volumes. &quot;Sonnets and Other Poems&quot; (1857) sold fewer than 200 copies, and &quot;Avolio&quot; (1859) was little noticed despite a positive review by James Russell Lowell. After the Civil War, &quot;Legends and Lyrics&quot; (1872) and &quot;The Mountains of the Lovers&quot; (1875) fared no better. A complete edition appeared in 1882. His poetry emphasizes romantic verse, long narrative poems, and ballads. Like other fellow Southern poets of his day, his work was highly descriptive of nature. Some critics contend that his graceful lyrics reflect the influence of poet John Keats. In a review of his work by Rayburn S. Moore, his influences are described as also including Geoffrey Chaucer, Edmund Spenser, William Wordsworth, and Alfred Tennyson, although the derivative nature and lack of intellectual force are considered weaknesses. Moore considers strengths of Hayne&#x27;s poetry to include the authenticity of detail and observation of locality and situation as well as the versatility of forms, metrical schemes, and techniques, especially in short poems and sonnets. Hayne&#x27;s sonnets are considered his best work. He was appreciated even in the north and became known as an unofficial poet laureate of the South, and at least one scholar referred to him as a &quot;Poet of the Confederacy&quot;.

The Paul Hayne School in Birmingham, Alabama was named for Hayne after he sent an original poem and book of verse to the school on the occasion of its dedication in 1886.

<doc id="1078708" wikidata="Q3325838" url="?curid=1078708" title="Synchronet">
<text>Synchronet is a multiplatform BBS software package, with current ports for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and BSD variants. Past versions also ran on MS-DOS and OS/2, but support for those platforms were dropped in version 3.0 (circa 2000).

==History==
Synchronet was originally written by Rob Swindell (a.k.a. Digital Man) due to his desire for certain features which WWIV lacked, such as support for multiple simultaneous nodes, batch uploads and bidirectional file transfer. The bulk of the programming for the first version of Synchronet was done during a two-month period in 1991 when Swindell was house-ridden while he recovered from surgery. The software was named for its ability to run synchronously on a network.

In July 1991, the author began running his own BBS, Vertrauen, on Synchronet. Initially, he had no intention of releasing Synchronet publicly, but as word of his software spread and he received offers to buy copies of Synchronet, he eventually relented, formed a company called Digital Dynamics, and sold copies of Synchronet at a price of $100 without source code, and $200 with source code. In April 1992, Swindell&#x27;s employer went out of business and he began to rely exclusively on commercial sales of Synchronet for his livelihood, placing advertisements in the BBS-related magazines &quot;Boardwatch&quot; and &quot;BBS Callers Digest&quot;. The first copy of Synchronet sold through the magazine ads was in June 1992.

Synchronet was the first BBS package to support QWK message networking natively without requiring any external utilities, in version 1a revision 10, released June 25, 1992. It was also the first BBS package with RIP support, in version 1b revision 1, released January 23, 1993.

Interest in Synchronet began to dwindle in late 1994, finally becoming nonexistent in 1995. Digital Dynamics effectively went bankrupt in the fall of 1995. Despite this, a beta version of version 2.30 of Synchronet for MS-DOS and an alpha version for OS/2 were released in early 1996. In August 1996, Swindell announced the uncertainty of Synchronet&#x27;s future. In 1997, version 2.30 of Synchronet was released as freeware, and the source code was released into the public domain later that year.

In April 1999, Swindell revived Synchronet development, revamping it considerably and converting much of the code to C++. Another version, 2.30c, was released in December 1999, fixing Y2K bugs and introducing some minor new features from the upcoming 3.x series. Version 3.00b was released June 25, 2000 and was the first official release of the 3.x series, featuring a native 32-bit Windows version and many new Internet-related features, such as a built-in telnet server. For this release, dial-up support was dropped making it a TCP/IP-only system. In October 2000, Synchronet was released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

In late 2001, Stephen Hurd (Deuce) joined the project initially as *nix developer. He ported the BBS to FreeBSD and did much of the Linux development work. His first &quot;big&quot; contribution was an implementation of Borlands conio library to allow the configuration utilities which were originally written for DOS to run on the Unix-like platforms.

Around the same time, Swindell started embedding the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine into Synchronet with an eye towards replacing the aging BAJA language which was used for most BBS customizations. While the BBS still requires BAJA scripts, much can be done with JavaScript. A socket object was added to the JavaScript engine and a &quot;Services&quot; server created which allowed simple TCP/IP services to be written easily. TCP/IP services written in JavaScript bundled with Synchronet include finger, gopher, IRC, and NNTP.

More internet services have been added in the native (C) code: FTP, SMTP and POP3 by Rob Swindell and rlogin, SSH and HTTP by Stephen Hurd.

In an interesting full circle, direct dial-up support for Synchronet is available again as Rob Swindell wrote a modem to telnet gateway program (SEXPOTS) for this purpose. Using this program, SysOps can once again offer their BBSes via direct modem-to-modem connections.

==Sub projects==

===Libraries===
* xpdev is a cross platform development library which provides such features as threading, .ini file parsing, consistent *printf() functions, and other small utility functions to the rest of the project. Effectively every Synchronet sub project relies on xpdev. The primary developer is Rob Swindell.
* ciolib ciolib is clean room implementation of Borland&#x27;s conio library which supports the display of CP437 using the Win32 console, SDL, X11, curses and ANSI via stdio. It also has an ANSI terminal emulator which supports ANSI-BBS, ANSI Music, Character pacing for ANSI Art animation, VT500 ESC[*r sequence for dynamic speed changes, Commodore 64 PETSCII and Atari 8-bit ATASCII in different screen modes, including 80x25, 80x28, 80x43, 80x50 and 80x60, as well as over 35 fonts imported from the FreeBSD syscons source as well as the ability to customize fonts. The primary developer is Stephen Hurd.
* UIFC is a text user interface library which provides the menuing system to the text mode configuration utilities bundled with Synchronet. Initially written by Rob Swindell, it was updated by Stephen Hurd to have it make use of the ciolib. It is considered feature complete, so active development occurs only when new features are required.
* comio is a generic serial (COM) port API implementation for Windows and *nix. It was initially designed by Rob Swindell as part of the SEXPOTS project and was ported to *nix by Stephen Hurd.

===BBS Utilities===

====SEXYZ====
SEXYZ (Synchronet External X-Modem, Y-Modem, Z-Modem) is an external file transfer program which supports X/Y/ZModem transfers. It was written to break the reliance on old DOS external protocols such as [F]DSZ and CEXYZ. It supports TCP socket and stdio transfers. It is functional and very little additional development on this is planned.

====SEXPOTS====
SEXPOTS (Synchronet EXternal Plain Old Telephone System) is a modem to telnet gateway. It accepts incoming modem calls and forwards them to the BBS via the Telnet or RLogin protocols.

====SyncTERM====
SyncTERM is terminal emulator which makes use of xpdev, ciolib, UIFC, and parts of SEXYZ and SEXPOTS. In addition to the platforms supported by Synchronet, it also runs on Solaris and Mac OS X.

Supported connectivity options are Telnet, rlogin, SSH, &quot;Raw&quot; sockets, standard modem connections and direct serial connections (using parts of SEXPOTS), and a pty interface on *nix. File transfer options include the ZMODEM, XMODEM and YMODEM transfer protocols (using parts of SEXYZ.)

====SyncDraw====
SyncDraw is an ANSI art editor which was initially a cleanup of an old version of MysticDraw. It uses xpdev and ciolib but is not yet complete. It supports the use of TheDraw fonts, and can save to the Synchronet Control-A code format, but is generally considered too incomplete for serious usage.

==Third-party software==
The Synchronet project has shown a willingness to &quot;adopt&quot; third-party BBS related software into its CVS tree. Generally, the software is updated to use xpdev and run on the platforms that Synchronet does and then is left in the CVS tree without active development.

===Domain Entertainment Doors===
Domain Entertainment was once one of the major companies which wrote addons specifically for Synchronet. Some of their software has since been released as open source and has been imported into the Synchronet CVS tree under the xtrn directory.

====Domain Poker====
Domain Poker is a single/multi-player, real-time, 5 card draw poker game.
The game can have up to 6 players per table, and up to 25 tables. Each table
has a configurable bet limit, ante, and table limit. Tables can be password
protected for private games, and the &quot;house&quot; can take a configurable percentage
of the pot from games.

Single player games are played against the computer. The computer can be
turned off completely, or allowed to play only on certain tables (at your
option). You also have the option to not allow the computer to be on password
protected tables (to keep users from hogging the tables for themselves).

====The Beast&#x27;s Domain====
The Beast&#x27;s Domain is a multiplayer, interactive, real-time, Rogue-like ANSI adventure game. The Beast&#x27;s Domain can handle up to 250 simultaneous players.

===OpenDoors===
OpenDoors was one of the most popular C &quot;door kits&quot;. Support for the DOOR32 drop file format as well as generic sockets was added by Rob Swindell and *nix compatibility was added by Stephen Hurd.

===Other Doors===
Other door sources that have been adopted include by developers:
*The Clans
*New York 2008
*Smurf Combat
*Tasmanian Strategical
*Time Port
*Virtual BBS 3

<doc id="1078709" wikidata="Q944199" url="?curid=1078709" title="Larry Fitzgerald">
<text>Larry Darnell Fitzgerald Jr. (born August 31, 1983) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played 17 seasons with the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers, earning unanimous All-American honors in 2003. Fitzgerald was selected by the Cardinals with the third overall pick in the 2004 NFL draft. He is widely considered by fans, coaches and peers to be one of the greatest receivers in NFL history.
Fitzgerald has been selected for the Pro Bowl eleven times. He was named first-team All-Pro in 2008 and second-team All-Pro twice in 2009 and 2011. He is second in NFL career receiving yards, second in career receptions, and sixth in career receiving touchdowns. He was named to the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team and NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

Fitzgerald became a minority owner of the Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2020.

==Early life==
As a teenager, Fitzgerald worked as a ball boy for the Minnesota Vikings under coach Dennis Green. &quot;You know just being around your childhood idols,&quot; Fitzgerald said in a 2015 interview. &quot;Coach Green gave me an opportunity of a lifetime to be around Cris Carter, Warren Moon, Joey Browner, Randy Moss, and Robert Smith. I can go on and on. To see their work ethic and dedication to their craft, that was really an eye-opening experience for a 14-year-old, 15-year-old. It was like on-the-job training almost.&quot;

Fitzgerald attended and played high school football at the Academy of Holy Angels in Richfield, Minnesota. While there, he was a two-time First-team All-State wide receiver. Fitzgerald did not meet NCAA requirements to play football as a freshman, so he spent a year at Valley Forge Military Academy in Pennsylvania.

==College career==

Fitzgerald attended the University of Pittsburgh, where he played for the Pittsburgh Panthers football team under head coach Walt Harris. He was widely considered one of the best wide receivers in college football from 2002 to 2003.

===2002===

In his freshman season, Fitzgerald was an instant contributor. In the second game of the season against #20 Texas A&amp;M, he had ten receptions for 103 yards in the 14–12 loss. Three weeks later, against Toledo, he had six receptions for 121 yards and his first two collegiate touchdowns in the 37–19 victory. On November 2, Fitzgerald had another stellar outing against #3 Virginia Tech with five receptions for 105 yards and three touchdowns in the 28–21 victory. In the last regular season game on November 30, he had 11 receptions for 159 yards and two touchdowns against #24 West Virginia in the 24–17 loss. Pitt finished with an 8–4 record and qualified for a bowl game. In the 2002 Insight Bowl, Fitzgerald had five receptions for 88 yards and a touchdown in the 38–13 victory over Oregon State. Overall, in the 2002 season, Fitzgerald had a Big-East conference leading 69 receptions for 1,005 yards and twelve touchdowns.

===2003===

Fitzgerald had a stellar sophomore season in 2003. He began the campaign against Kent State with six receptions for 123 yards and three touchdowns in the 43–3 victory. In the next game against Ball State, he had seven receptions for 124 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–21 victory. Fitzgerald once again put out a great effort in the following game against Toledo with 12 receptions for 201 yards and a touchdown in the 35–31 loss. In the next game against Texas A&amp;M, Fitzgerald had his fourth consecutive game with at least 100 receiving yards with seven receptions for 135 yards and three touchdowns in the 37–26 victory. Two weeks later, against Notre Dame, he was held under 100 yards for the first time but still had five receptions for 79 yards and two touchdowns in the 20–14 loss. Fitzgerald bounced back in the next game against Rutgers with eight receptions for a season-high 207 yards and two touchdowns in the 42–32 victory. Fitzgerald&#x27;s hot streak continued in the next game against Syracuse, where he had eight receptions for 149 yards and two touchdowns in the 34–14 victory. Fitzgerald&#x27;s performance against the Orange was his fourth consecutive game with at least two touchdowns.

Fitzgerald started the month of November with seven receptions for 156 yards and a touchdown in a 24–13 victory over Boston College. In the following week against #5 Virginia Tech, he had eight receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown in the 31–28 upset victory. Fitzgerald added another great performance against West Virginia in the following week with nine receptions for 185 yards and two touchdowns in the 52–31 loss. In the following week against Temple, he had seven receptions for 102 yards and two touchdowns as the Panthers won 30–16. Fitzgerald&#x27;s performance against the Owls was his sixth consecutive game with at least 100 receiving yards. Fitzgerald&#x27;s impressive streak ended the following week against #10 Miami with three receptions for 26 yards and a touchdown in the 28–14 loss. Despite having a season-low in yardage, Fitzgerald ended up recording his 12th consecutive game with at least one touchdown reception in the 2003 season, and 18th straight game with a touchdown reception dating back to the previous season. Pitt finished with an 8–4 record in the regular season and qualified for a bowl game. In the 2003 Continental Tire Bowl, Fitzgerald had five receptions for 77 yards against Virginia in the final game of his collegiate career, a 23–16 loss.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
Although Fitzgerald had played at Pitt for only two years without redshirting, he petitioned the NFL to allow him to enter the NFL draft, as he had left his high school, Academy of Holy Angels, during his senior year to attend Valley Forge Military Academy. The NFL granted an exception to allow Fitzgerald to enter the draft, as Fitzgerald had convinced the NFL that the time he spent at VFMA, combined with his time at Pitt, was the minimum three years removed from high school to make him eligible for the draft. Although former Ohio State running back Maurice Clarett was suing the NFL at the time to overturn the rule (a case Clarett initially won, but it was later overturned on appeal), the NFL considered Fitzgerald&#x27;s case separate from Clarett&#x27;s.

Fitzgerald continues to remain a part of the team&#x27;s ownership following Sarver&#x27;s year-long suspension from the NBA and later buyout of the team to new owners Mat Ishbia and Justin Ishbia, being one of three minority owners to keep all of their stakes with the team once the sale went through on February 7, 2023. Later in 2023, Fitzgerald and Suns player Devin Booker would become part-owners of a new pickleball team, formed as part of a 12-team expansion to Major League Pickleball.

Fitzgerald has competed in the American Century Championship, a celebrity golf tournament featuring athletes and entertainers. He has also played at Augusta National Golf Club and has been actively involved in events promoting the sport. 

In 2024, Fitzgerald was named an honorary co-chair of the U.S. Amateur Championship, recognizing his contributions to golf.

Fitzgerald established the “Larry Fitzgerald First Down Fund” to help kids and their families by funding positive activities for kids during the summer and throughout the year, supporting kids and families in crisis and supporting health-related organizations that work with families. One initiative the “First Down Fund” holds each summer are youth football camps in Arizona and Minnesota. In May 2014, Fitzgerald and Lenovo provided five schools in Minneapolis and four schools in Phoenix Lenovo tablets and equipment to enable the children to gain access to technology. The First Down Fund made a donation to the Minneapolis Park and Recreation to help refurbish a basketball court at Rev Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Park. The court received new hoops, poles, backboards and benches. He partnered with Riddell to provide new helmets to 1,000 kids in the Minneapolis Parks and Recreation football program.

Fitzgerald established the “Carol Fitzgerald Memorial Fund” in honor of his mother, who died of breast cancer in 2003. The organization offers support to causes that Fitzgerald&#x27;s mother held dear, including educating urban youth about HIV/AIDS and breast cancer issues. He has served as an NFL spokesman for the league-wide breast cancer awareness initiative “A Crucial Catch” for three years and every October makes donations to breast cancer organizations based on his touchdowns and receptions during the month.

In August 2012, he was honored with the 14th annual Pro Football Weekly Arthur S. Arkush Humanitarian Award for his community and charitable contributions.
Fitzgerald has made five USO tours to visit soldiers overseas and has raised financial support for injured and critically ill members of the U.S. military.

During the 2013 season, Fitzgerald was honored with the NFL Players Association Georgetown Lombardi Award.

<text>Bill Gates&#x27; flower fly (&quot;Eristalis gatesi&quot;) is a flower fly endemic to Costa Rica named after Bill Gates. Another fly found in similar habitats was named after Gates&#x27; associate Paul Allen, called Paul Allen&#x27;s flower fly (&quot;Eristalis alleni&quot;); according to Chris Thompson, the describer of these species, both names were in &quot;recognition of [their] great contributions to the science of Dipterology&quot;.

<doc id="1078713" wikidata="Q1559438" url="?curid=1078713" title="Eliza Haywood">
<text>Eliza Haywood (c. 1693 – 25 February 1756), born Elizabeth Fowler, was an English writer, actress and publisher. An increase in interest and recognition of Haywood&#x27;s literary works began in the 1980s. Described as &quot;prolific even by the standards of a prolific age&quot;, Haywood wrote and published over 70 works in her lifetime, including fiction, drama, translations, poetry, conduct literature and periodicals. Haywood today is studied primarily as one of the 18th-century founders of the novel in English.

==Biography==
Scholars of Eliza Haywood universally agree upon only one thing: the exact date of her death. Haywood gave conflicting accounts of her own life; her origins remain unclear, and there are presently contending versions of her biography. For example, it was once mistakenly believed that she married the Rev. Valentine Haywood. According to report, Haywood took pains to keep her personal life private, asking the one (unnamed) person with knowledge of her private life to remain silent for fear that such facts may be misrepresented in print. Apparently, that person felt loyal enough to Haywood to honour her request.

The early life of Eliza Haywood is somewhat of a mystery to scholars. While Haywood was born &quot;Eliza Fowler&quot;, the exact date of Haywood&#x27;s birth is unknown due to the lack of surviving records. Although scholars believe that she was most likely born near Shropshire or London, England, in 1693, her birth date is extrapolated from a combination of her death date and her stated age at the time of her death (Haywood died on 25 February 1756 and obituaries notices list her age as sixty years).

Haywood&#x27;s familial connections, education status, and social position are unknown. Some scholars have speculated that she is related to Sir Richard Fowler of Harnage Grange, who had a younger sister named Elizabeth. Others have stated that Haywood was most likely from London, England as several Elizabeths were born to Fowler families in 1693 in London; however, no evidence exists to positively confirm any of these possible connections. Her first entry in public records appears in Dublin, Ireland, in 1715. In this entry, she is listed as &quot;Mrs. Haywood&quot;, performing in Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s Shakespeare adaptation, &quot;Timon of Athens; or, The Man-Hater&quot; at the Smock Alley Theatre. Haywood described herself as a &quot;widow&quot;, noting in 1719 that her marriage was &quot;unfortunate&quot;, but no record of her marriage has been found and the identity of her husband remains unknown.

Scholars have speculated that Haywood had an affair and even a child with Richard Savage in the 1720s, in addition to a 20-year open relationship with William Hatchett, who was suspected of being the father of her second child. However, later critics have called these speculations into question as too heavily influenced by Alexander Pope&#x27;s famous illustration of her in &quot;The Dunciad&quot; and too little based upon evidence. (Pope depicted Haywood as a grotesque figure with two &quot;babes of love&quot; at her waist, one by a poet and the other by a bookseller.) Other accounts from the period, however, suggest that her &quot;friends&quot; rejected Pope&#x27;s scandalous depiction of her; they maintained that she had been deserted by her husband and left to raise their children alone. In fact, and despite the popular belief that she was once a woman of ill repute, Haywood seems to have had no particular scandals attached her name whatsoever.

Haywood&#x27;s friendship with Richard Savage is thought to have begun around 1719. Savage wrote the gushing &#x27;puff&#x27; for the anonymous &quot;Part I&quot; of her first novel, &quot;Love in Excess&quot;. The two appear to have been close in these early years, sharing many associates in literary and theatrical circles, even sharing the same publisher, William Chetwood. By September 1725, however, Savage and Haywood had fallen out, and he anonymously attacked her as a &#x27;cast-off Dame&#x27; desperate for acclaim in &quot;The Authors of the Town&quot;. Savage is considered the likely impetus for Pope&#x27;s attack on Haywood.

Haywood&#x27;s association with Aaron Hill and the literary coterie known as The Hillarians seems to have followed a similar pattern as Haywood rose to fame. The Hillarians, a collection of writers and artists &quot;committed to a progressive programme of ameliorating &#x27;politeness&#x27;&quot;, included Savage, Hill, Martha Fowke, and for a time, Haywood. The group shared poems to and about each other, and formed a social circle of like minds. Haywood seems to have greatly admired Hillwho, though not a patron, seems to have promoted young, up-and-coming artistsand dedicated poems to him. She may have even seen him as a mentor during the earliest years of her career.
William Hatchett was a long-time colleague and collaborator. The two probably met around 1728 or 1729, and recent critics have touted the pair as domestic partners or lovers, though this suggestion has now been challenged. He was a player, playwright, pamphleteer and translator (and perhaps &quot;sponge&quot;) who shared a stage career with Haywood, and they collaborated on an adaptation of &quot;The Tragedy of Tragedies&quot; by Henry Fielding (with whom she also collaborated) and an opera, &quot;The Opera of Operas; or, Tom Thumb the Great&quot; (1733). They also may have collaborated on a translation of Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon&#x27;s &quot;Le Sopha&quot; in 1742. Hatchett has even been seen as the father of Haywood&#x27;s second child (based on Pope&#x27;s reference to &quot;a Bookseller&quot; as a father of one of her children, though Hatchett was not a bookseller.) No clear evidence supporting this or a domestic partnership is extant.

Haywood&#x27;s long writing career began in 1719 with the first instalment of &quot;Love in Excess&quot;, a novel, and ended in the year she died with the conduct books &quot;The Wife&quot; and &quot;The Husband&quot; and contributions to the biweekly periodical &quot;The Young Lady&quot;. She wrote in almost every genre, often anonymously. Haywood is now considered &quot;the foremost female &#x27;author by profession&#x27; and businesswoman of the first half of the eighteenth century&quot;, tireless and prolific in her endeavours as an author, poet, playwright, periodical writer and editor, and publisher. During the early 1720s, &quot;Mrs Haywood&quot; dominated the novel market in London, so much so that contemporary Henry Fielding created a comic character, &quot;Mrs. Novel&quot;, in &quot;The Author&#x27;s Farce&quot;, modelled after her.

Haywood fell ill in October 1755 and died on 25 February 1756, actively publishing up to her death. She was buried in Saint Margaret&#x27;s Church near Westminster Abbey in an unmarked grave in the churchyard. For unknown reasons, her burial was delayed by about a week and her death duties remain unpaid.

==Acting and drama==

Haywood began her acting career in 1715 at the Smock Alley Theatre in Dublin. Public records for this year list her as &quot;Mrs. Haywood,&quot; appearing in Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s Shakespeare adaptation, &quot;Timon of Athens; or, The Man-Hater&quot;.

By 1717, she had moved to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, where she worked for John Rich. Rich had her rewrite a play called &quot;The Fair Captive&quot;. The play only ran for three nights (to the author&#x27;s benefit), but Rich added a fourth night as a benefit for the second author, Haywood. In 1723, her first play, &quot;A Wife to be Lett&quot;, was staged.

In the later 1720s, Haywood continued acting, moving over to the Haymarket Theatre to join Henry Fielding in the opposition plays of the 1730s. In 1729, she wrote the tragedy &quot;Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Lunenburgh&quot; to honour Frederick, Prince of Wales. George II&#x27;s son was later a locus for Patriot Whig and Tory opposition to the ministry of Robert Walpole. As he made it clear that he did not favour his father&#x27;s policies or ministry, praise for him was a demurral. However, when Haywood wrote the play, it is likely that she was still aiming to secure the patronage of the whole royal family, including Queen Caroline, as the royal split had yet to occur. Others, such as James Thomson and Henry Brooke, were also writing such &quot;patriotic&quot; plays (i. e. supportive of the Patriot Whigs) at the time, and Henry Carey would soon satirise the failed promise of George II.

Haywood&#x27;s greatest Haymarket success came in 1733, with &quot;The Opera of Operas&quot;, an adaptation of Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tragedy of Tragedies&quot; with music by J. F. Lampe and Thomas Arne). However, it was an adaptation with a sharp difference. Caroline of Ansbach had affected a reconciliation between George I and George II, which meant an endorsement by George II of the Whig ministry. Haywood&#x27;s adaptation contains a reconciliation scene, replete with symbols from Caroline&#x27;s own grotto. This enunciated a change in Haywood herself, away from any Tory or anti-Walpolean causes she had supported previously. It did not go unnoticed by her contemporaries.

In 1735, Haywood wrote a &quot;Companion to the Theatre&quot;. The volume contains plot summaries of contemporary plays, literary criticism, and dramaturgical observations. In 1747 she added a second volume.

After the Licensing Act 1737, the playhouse was shut against adventurous new plays such as hers.

==Fiction==
Haywood, Delarivier Manley and Aphra Behn were seen as &quot;the fair triumvirate of wit&quot; and major writers of amatory fiction. Haywood&#x27;s prolific works moved from titillating romance novels to the amatory during the early 1720s to works, focusing more on &quot;women&#x27;s rights and position&quot; (Schofield, Haywood 63) in the later 1720s into the 1730s. In the middle novels of her career, women would be locked up, tormented and beleaguered by domineering men, but in the later ones of the 1740s and 1750s marriage became a positive move for men and for women.

Due to the system for paying authors in 18th-century publishing, Haywood&#x27;s novels often ran to multiple volumes. Authors would be paid only once for a book and receive no royalties: a second volume meant a second payment.
Haywood&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Love in Excess; Or, The Fatal Enquiry&quot; (1719–1720) touches on education and marriage. Often classified as a work of amatory fiction, this novel is notable for its treatment of the fallen woman. D&#x27;Elmonte, the novel&#x27;s male protagonist, reassures one woman that she should not condemn herself: &quot;There are times, madam&quot;, he says &quot;in which the wisest have not power over their own actions.&quot; The fallen woman is given an unusually positive portrait.

&quot;Idalia; or The Unfortunate Mistress&quot; (1723) divides into three parts. In the first, Idalia appears as a young motherless, spoiled, yet wonderful Venetian aristocrat, whose varied amorous adventures carry her over most of Italy. Already in Venice she is sought by countless suitors, among them the base Florez, whom her father forbids the house. One suitor, Florez&#x27;s friend Don Ferdinand, resigns his suit, but Idalia&#x27;s vanity is piqued at the loss of an even a single adorer, and more from perverseness than from love continues to correspond with him. They meet, and he eventually effects her ruin. His beloved friend Henriquez conducts her to Padua, but also falls for her charms. He quarrels with Ferdinand and they eventually kill each other in a duel.

In the second part, Henriquez&#x27; brother, Myrtano, succeeds as Idalia&#x27;s principal adorer, and she reciprocates. She then receives a letter informing her of Myrtano&#x27;s engagement to another woman, and so she leaves for Verona, hoping to enter a convent. On the road her guide takes her to a rural retreat with the intention of killing her, but she escapes to Ancona, from where she takes ship for Naples. The sea captain pays crude court to her, but just in time to save her from his embraces, the ship is captured by corsairs commanded by a young married couple. Though the heroine is in peasant dress, she is treated with distinction by her captors. Her history moves them to tears and they in turn are in the midst of relating to Idalia an involved story of their courtship when the vessel is wrecked in a gale.

In the third part, Idalia is washed ashore on a plank. Succoured by cottagers, she continues her journey towards Rome in a man&#x27;s clothing. On the way, robbers beat her and leave her for dead. She is found and taken home by a lady, Antonia, who falls in love with her. Idalia later discovers that Antonia&#x27;s husband is her dear Myrtano. Their happiness is marred by the jealousy of his wife, who first tries to poison everyone and then appeals to the Pope to separate them. Idalia is taken to Rome first to a convent, where she leads a miserable life, persecuted by all the young gallants of the city. Then one day she sees Florez, the first cause of her misfortunes. With thoughts of revenge, she sends him a billet, but Myrtano keeps the appointment instead of Florez. Not recognising her lover, muffled in a cloak, Idalia stabs him, but upon recognising him is overcome by remorse, and dies by the same knife.
&quot;Fantomina; or Love in a Maze&quot; (1724) is a novella about a woman who assumes the roles of prostitute, handmaid, widow and lady, to seduce repeatedly a man named Beauplaisir. Schofield points out: &quot;Not only does she satisfy her own sexual inclinations, she smugly believes that &#x27;while he thinks to fool me, [he] is himself the only beguiled Person&#x27;&quot; (p. 50). The story asserts that women have some access to social force – a recurring theme in Haywood&#x27;s work. It has been argued that it owes a debt to the interpolated tale of an &quot;Invisible Mistress&quot; in Paul Scarron&#x27;s &quot;Roman Comique&quot;.

&quot;The Mercenary Lover; or, The Unfortunate Heiresses&quot; (1726) examines the risks women face in giving way to passion. Miranda, the eldest of two heiress sisters, marries Clitander, the mercenary lover of the title. Unsatisfied with Miranda&#x27;s half of the estate, Clitander seduces Althea, the younger sister, by plying her with romantic books and notions. She gives way to &quot;ungovernable passion&quot; and becomes pregnant. Clitander fools her into signing over her inheritance, then poisons her, killing both her and the unborn child.

&quot;The Distress&#x27;d Orphan; or Love in a Madhouse&quot; (1726) is a novella that relates the plight of a woman falsely imprisoned in a private madhouse. In Patrick Spedding&#x27;s &quot;A Bibliography of Eliza Haywood&quot;, he notes that &quot;The Distress&#x27;d Orphan; or Love in a Madhouse&quot; was more &quot;enduringly popular&quot;, &quot;reprinted more often, in larger editions, and remained in print for a longer period, than... &quot;Love in Excess&quot;&quot; (p. 21). It recounts the story of Annilia, who is an orphan and heiress. Her uncle and guardian Giraldo plan to gain access to her fortune by having her marry his son, Horatio. When Annilia meets Colonel Marathon at a dance and they fall in love, she rejects her uncle&#x27;s plan and prepares to move out of his home. In response, Giraldo declares her insane and has her confined in a private madhouse, so gaining control over her inheritance. Annilia languishes in the madhouse until Marathon enters it as a supposed patient and rescues her.
&quot;The Adventures of Eovaii: A Pre-Adamitical History&quot; (1736), also entitled &quot;The Unfortunate Princess&quot; (1741), is a satire of Prime Minister Robert Walpole, told through a sort of oriental fairy tale. &quot;The Anti-Pamela; or, Feign&#x27;d Innocence Detected&quot; (1741) is a satirical response to Samuel Richardson&#x27;s didactic novel &quot;Pamela, or, Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740), making fun of the idea of bargaining one&#x27;s maidenhead for a place in society. (Their contemporary Henry Fielding also reacted to &quot;Pamela&quot; in 1741 with &quot;An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews&quot;.) &quot;The Fortunate Foundlings&quot; (1744) is a picaresque novel, in which two children of opposite sex experience the world differently, in line with their gender.

&quot;The History of Miss Betsy Thoughtless&quot; (1751) is a sophisticated, multi-plot novel that has been deemed the first in English to explore female development in English. Betsy leaves her emotionally and financially abusive husband Munden and experiences independence for a time before she decides to marry again. Written a few years before her marriage-conduct books were published, the novel contains advice in the form of quips from Lady Trusty. Her &quot;patriarchal conduct-book advice to Betsy is often read literally as Haywood&#x27;s new advice for her female audience. However, Haywood&#x27;s audience consisted of both men and women, and Lady Trusty&#x27;s bridal admonitions, the most conservative and patriarchal words of advice in the novel, are contradictory and impossible for any woman to execute completely.&quot;

&quot;Betsy Thoughtless&quot; marks a strong change in 18th-century fiction. It portrays a mistaken, but intelligent and strong-willed woman, who gives way to society&#x27;s pressures to marry. According to Backsheider, &quot;Betsy Thoughtless&quot; as a novel of marriage, rather than the more popular subject of courtship, foreshadows a type of domestic novel that will culminate in the 19th century, for example in Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Instead of concerning itself with attracting a worthy partner, &quot;Betsy Thoughtless&quot; examines marrying well; its heroine learns that to give way to the role of women in marriage can be fulfilling.

The fullest and most detailed bibliography of Haywood is by Patrick Spedding.

==Periodicals and non-fiction==

While writing popular novels, Eliza Haywood also worked on periodicals, essays and manuals on social behaviour (conduct books). &quot;The Female Spectator&quot; (24 numbers, 1745–1746), a monthly, was written in response to the contemporary &quot;The Spectator&quot; by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. In &quot;The Female Spectator&quot;, Haywood wrote in four personae (Mira, Euphrosine, Widow of Quality and The Female Spectator) and took positions on issues such as marriage, children, reading, education and conduct. It was the first periodical written for women by a woman and arguably one of her most significant contributions to women&#x27;s writing. Haywood followed a lead by contemporary John Dunton who issued the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Mercury&quot; as a companion to his successful &quot;Athenian Mercury&quot;. Though &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Mercury&quot; was a self-proclaimed women&#x27;s journal, it was produced by men (Spacks, p. xii).

&quot;The Parrot&quot; (1746) apparently earned her questions from the government for political statements about Charles Edward Stuart. &quot;Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots&quot; (1725) is termed a &quot;hybrid&quot; by Schofield (p. 103), as a work of non-fiction that makes use of narrative techniques. &quot;Reflections on the Various Effects of Love&quot; (1726) is a didactic account of what can happen to a woman when she gives in to her passions. This piece displays the sexual double standard that allows men to love freely without social consequence and women to be called scandalous for doing the same. &quot;The Wife&quot; and &quot;The Husband&quot; (1756) are conduct books for each partner in a marriage. &quot;The Wife&quot; was first published anonymously (by Mira, one of Haywood&#x27;s personas from &quot;The Female Spectator&quot;); &quot;The Husband: in Answer to The Wife&quot; followed later the same year with Haywood&#x27;s name attached.

Haywood also worked on sensational pamphlets on the contemporary deaf-mute prophet, Duncan Campbell. They include &quot;A Spy Upon the Conjurer&quot; (1724) and &quot;The Dumb Projector: Being a Surprising Account of a Trip to Holland Made by Duncan Campbell&quot; (1725).

==Political writings==
Eliza Haywood was active in politics throughout her career, although she changed parties around the time George II was reconciled to Robert Walpole. She wrote a series of parallel histories, beginning with the &quot;Memoirs of a Certain Island, Adjacent to Utopia&quot; (1724), and then &quot;The Secret History of the Present Intrigues of the Court of Caramania&quot; (1727). Her &quot;Memoirs of an Unfortunate Young Nobleman&quot; (1743) fictionalised the life of James Annesley.

In 1746 she started another journal, &quot;The Parrot&quot;, for which she was questioned by the government on political statements about Charles Edward Stuart, just after the Jacobite rising of 1745. This happened again with &quot;A Letter from H---- G----g, Esq.&quot; (1750). She grew more directly political in &quot;The Invisible Spy&quot; (1755) and &quot;The Wife&quot; (1756).

==Translations==
Haywood published eight translations of popular continental romances: &quot;Letters from a Lady of Quality&quot; (1721, translating Edme Boursault&#x27;s play), &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1723, translating Louis Adrien Duperron de Castera&#x27;s historical novel), &quot;La Belle Assemblée&quot; (1724–1734, translating Madame de Gomez&#x27;s novella), &quot;Love in its Variety&quot; (1727, translating Matteo Bandello&#x27;s stories), &quot;The Disguis&#x27;d Prince&quot; (1728, translating Madame de Villedieu&#x27;s 1679 novel), &quot;The Virtuous Villager&quot; (1742, translating Charles de Fieux&#x27;s work), and with William Hatchett, &quot;The Sopha&quot; (1743, translating Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon&#x27;s novel).

==Critical reception==
Haywood is notable as a transgressive, outspoken writer of amatory fiction, plays, romance and novels. Paula R. Backscheider claims, &quot;Haywood&#x27;s place in literary history is equally remarkable and as neglected, misunderstood, and misrepresented as her œuvre&quot; (p. xiii intro drama).

For a time Eliza Haywood was more frequently noted for appearing in Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Dunciad&quot; rather than on her literary merits. Though Alexander Pope centred her in the heroic games of &quot;The Dunciad&quot; in Book II, she was in his view &quot;vacuous&quot;. He does not dismiss her as a woman, but as having nothing of her own to say – for her politics and implicitly for plagiarism. Unlike other &quot;dunces&quot;, Pope&#x27;s verdict does not seem to have caused her subsequent obscurity. Rather it was as literary historians came to praise and value the masculine novel and most importantly dismiss the courtship novel and novels of eroticism that she was upstaged by more chaste or overtly philosophical works. In &quot;The Dunciad,&quot; booksellers race to reach Eliza, their reward to be all of her books and her company. In Pope&#x27;s view, she is for sale, in other words, in literature and society. As with other &quot;dunces&quot;, she was not without complicity in the attack. Haywood had begun to make it known that she was poor and in need of funds; she seemed to be writing for pay and to please an undiscerning public.

In the conclusion to &quot;Old Mortality&quot; (1816), one of Walter Scott&#x27;s comic characters references Haywood&#x27;s &quot;Jemmy and Jenny Jessamy&quot; (1753) as a model of pathos. Editors suggest the novel had become something of a joke in literary circles by the late 18th century.

Eliza Haywood is seen as &quot;a case study in the politics of literary history&quot; (Backscheider, p. 100). She is also being re-evaluated by feminist scholars and rated highly. Interest has burgeoned since the 1980s. Her novels are seen as stylistically innovative. Her plays and political writing attracted most attention in her own time, and she was a full player in that difficult public sphere. Her novels, voluminous and frequent, are now seen as stylistically innovative and important transitions from the erotic seduction novels and poetry of Aphra Behn, particularly &quot;Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister&quot; (1684), and the straightforward, plain-spoken novels of Frances Burney. In her own day, her plays and political writing attracted the most comment and attention – she was a full player in the difficult public sphere – but today her novels carry the most interest and demonstrate the most significant innovation.

==As a publisher==
Works published under her imprint:
Haywood not only wrote works to be published, but participated in the publication process. Sometimes in collaboration with William Hatchett, at least nine works under her own imprint. Most were available for sale at the Sign of Fame (her pamphlet shop in Covent Gardens), including:
* &quot;Anti-Pamela&quot; by Eliza Haywood (1741)
* &quot;Sublime Character of his Excellency Somebody&quot; by Unknown (1741)
** Title page states that the work was &quot;Originally Written by a Celebrated French Wit&quot;
* &quot;The Busy-Body: or, Successful Spy&quot; by Susannah Centlivre (1742)
* &quot;The Ghost of Eustace Budgel Esq. to the Man in Blue&quot; possibly by William Hatchett (1742)
* &quot;The Right Honourable, sir Robert Walpole, (Now Earl of Orford) Vindicated&quot; by &quot;A Brother Minister in Disgrace&quot; (1742)
* &quot;The Virtuous Villager&quot; by Eliza Haywood (1742)
* &quot;A Remarkable Cause on a Note of Hand&quot; by William Hatchett (1742)
* &quot;The Equity of Parnassus&quot; by Unknown (1744)
* &quot;A Letter from H[enry] G[orin]g&quot; by Eliza Haywood (1749)

King notes that the 18th-century definition of &quot;publisher&quot; could also cover bookselling. King is uncertain whether Haywood produced the books and pamphlets that she sold (as Spedding indicates) or whether she was a bookseller, especially for her own early productions. Haywood sometimes collaborated on publishing so as to share the costs, as she did with Cogan on &quot;The Virtuous Villager&quot;. In any case, Haywood was certainly a bookseller, for many and various works &quot;to be had&quot; at the Sign of Fame did not bear her imprint.

<doc id="1078714" wikidata="Q15218728" url="?curid=1078714" title="Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric">
<text>The Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric (OOA; Serbian and , &quot;Pravoslavna ohridska arhiepiskopija&quot; (POA)), also known as Orthodox Archdiocese of Ohrid, was an autonomous Eastern Orthodox archbishopric of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) with jurisdiction over the territory of North Macedonia. Its creation was initiated in 2002 and formalized in 2005. 

The Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric was refused registration by the State Religion Commission of North Macedonia on the grounds that one group may be registered for each confession and that the name was not sufficiently distinct from that of the MOC. Numerous international organizations have criticized the authorities of North Macedonia for their moves towards the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric and Archbishop Jovan VI, raising the possibility of a threat to religious freedoms. In 2023, after the reconciliation of the SOC and the Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC), the OOA was integrated into MOC.

==Creation==
Some Macedonian bishops sought to reconcile their differences with the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) and negotiated regarding the status of the Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC), which had separated from SOC since its self-declared autocephaly in 1967. These negotiations led to an agreement that was signed in Niš in May 2002 - the Niš Agreement. Three bishops of both delegations signed the agreement. It was supposed to grant MOC autonomous status. The signing of the document caused an uproar in Macedonia (now North Macedonia). The Macedonian bishops attempted to defend it for a short time. It was soon rejected by the Synod of MOC. The Serbian patriarch Pavle invited all MOC&#x27;s bishops, clergy, monastics and faithful people to enter into liturgical and canonical unity with the Serbian Orthodox Church. Jovan Vraniškovski and all priests of Veles agreed to respond to this call, and all signed a document of agreement. Vraniškovski was the only metropolitan to accept the invitation.

On 23 September 2002, Metropolitan Jovan was appointed Exarch of all the territories of the Ohrid Archdiocese by the Assembly of the Serbian Orthodox Church. On 25 December 2003, he was elected Chairman of the Holy Synod of Bishops of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric, after it had been constituted. On 24 May 2005, he was confirmed by the Serbian Patriarch as &quot;Archbishop of Ohrid and Metropolitan of Skopje&quot; in accordance with the Niš Agreement. On the same day, there was an announcement of the Patriarchal and the Assembly&#x27;s &quot;tomos&quot; for autonomy of the Ohrid Archbishopric, with Archbishop Jovan as the Chairman of the Holy Synod of Bishops. Its seat was in the village of Nižepole and it had the purpose of administering the dioceses of the Serbian Orthodox Church in North Macedonia. As it had internal autonomy as the canonical branch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, it could also rely on the support of all canonical Orthodox churches. The Archbishopric claimed inheritance from the Archbishopric of Ohrid, established in 1019 by Byzantine Emperor Basil II by lowering the status of the autocephalous Bulgarian Patriarchate and abolished in 1767 by the Ottomans.

==Persecution==
In January 2004, Vraniškovski and a dozen of his followers were arrested by the police. A fifth monastery, &quot;Saint John Chrysostom&quot; in the village Nižepole near Bitola, was broken into by armed and masked men, who harassed and threatened the nuns with machine guns, cut their hair and set the monastery on fire, in February 2004. Following the rejection of its registration application by the Macedonian authorities, the police raided Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric&#x27;s buildings. The police and priests of the Macedonian Orthodox Church visited members to pressure them to abandon their adherence to OOA. The Church in the &quot;Saint John Chrysostom&quot; monastery was demolished by the state authorities on 15 October 2004. The chapel &quot;St. Nectarios of Aegina&quot; was demolished on 12 July 2005 in the Skopje suburb of Dračevo. Additional harassment complaints have been reported.

Archbishop Jovan was sentenced to 18 months of prison in June 2005 for &quot;[i]nstigation of ethnic, racial and religious hatred, discord and intolerance&quot;. The verdict stated the conviction relied on these three points:
# He wrote a text in a religious calendar in which he slandered the Macedonian Orthodox Church.
# He agreed to be appointed as an Exarch of the Ohrid Archbishopric in Macedonia and participated in the ordination of the bishops Joakim (Jovčevski) and Marko (Kimev).
# He officiated at a religious service in an apartment owned by his parents.

He served 220 days in prison before the Supreme Court declared the last two of the three points to be unconstitutional and his sentence was shortened to 8 months. Archbishop Jovan was sentenced for the second time, on charges for &quot;Embezzlement&quot;, and as a second defendant was sentenced to a higher prison term of 2 years than the first defendant (who was sentenced 1 year and 3 months) in 2006. He served 256 days before being released. The Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric was repeatedly denied registration by the state authorities.

===International reactions===
* The United States Department of State includes in its &quot;Religious Freedom Report&quot; and &quot;Human Rights Report&quot; information regarding the &quot;restrictions of the religious freedoms of the members of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric, existence of religious prisoners, violation of freedom of movement, police terror and demolition of a monastery, prevention of OSCE from obtaining a copy of the decision upon which the demolition was carried out, police interrogations of the members of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric etc.&quot;
* The US Mission to the OSCE in 2004 warned of &quot;Violation of freedom of religion and encouraged the authorities to apply the law fairly, advising the government should avoid involving in religious disputes, reminding that Article Nine of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 19 of the Macedonian Constitution as well as Macedonia’s OSCE commitments, and international norms, all guarantee his right to freedom of religion&quot;&quot;.&quot;
* The European Commission pointed out that &quot;cases of violations of religious freedom exist and emphasized that the new law should provide more liberal procedure for registering religious communities&quot;.
* The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2018 that the refusal of the government to register the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric constitutes a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.
* Amnesty International declared the Archbishop Jovan as a prisoner of conscience in 2004.
* In Freedom House&#x27;s 2005 publication, &quot;Macedonia received a downward trend arrow due to [...] an increase in the harassment of leaders of various religious groups&quot;. Freedom House reported in 2007 that Archbishop Jovan has been &quot;arrested [...] for his ties to the Serbian Orthodox Church.&quot; 
* The Helsinki Committee for Human Rights reported about the violation of the religious freedoms and human rights of the members of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric: &quot;The violation of several basic rights was the result of activities of a number of state institutions (especially the Ministry of the Interior) directed against not only the followers (monks of the MOC who were supporting Vraniskovski), but also against citizens who approve of him or had compassionate sentiments or attitude towards them. This can be illustrated by the following: problems upon entry and exit from the state, threats, police detention, lawsuits against citizens who have provided housing for the outcast monks, police ban in the exercise of the right to residence&quot;.
* Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe reported about the imprisonment of Archbishop Jovan in 2005, finding that &quot;Macedonian officials, in response to the ecclesiastical dispute concerning the status of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, have over-reacted and that the 18-month prison term sentence is excessive and unjustified&quot;. Regarding the case of the destruction of the chapel, the report states that &quot;&quot;&quot;The government, at least, must exhibit more restraint and end these harassments, and also pay reparations for the destroyed buildings. The report also covers the religious freedom governing legal framework, finding it ambiguous, and further stating that Since religious groups are required to register, the lack of a clear mechanism can be problematic.&quot; 
* Norwegian human rights organization Forum 18 reported in 2008 that the country&#x27;s 2007 religion law perpetuates discrimination.
* Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Macedonia, requesting immediate release of Archbishop Jovan.
* Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow sent a letter to the President of Macedonia in 2005, demanding immediate release of the Archbishop Jovan.
* Holy Synod of Hierarchs of the Church of Greece expressed a severe protest in 2006 for an emergent release of Archbishop Jovan from prison, and for respect of religious freedom in Macedonia.
* The Holy Community of the Mount Athos sent a letter of support to the Archbishop Jovan in 2004, signed by all representatives and abbots who are in the common Assembly of the twenty Holy Monasteries of the Holy Mount Athos.
* The Standing Conference of the Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas condemned the imprisonment of Archbishop Jovan by Macedonia and asked for his release in 2005.
* Metropolitan Herman of the Orthodox Church in America called for release of Archbishop Jovan of Ohrid in 2006.

== Abolition ==
On 15 May 2022 at the first session of the annual meeting of the Holy Council of Bishops of the Serbian Orthodox Church, an &quot;Encyclical on the Occasion of the Centennial Celebration of the Re-establishment of the Serbian Patriarchate&quot; was adopted and signed by all bishops of SOC, including all four bishops of OOA. At the second session, held on 16 May, the Council decided to resolve various disputes with the Macedonian Orthodox Church, thus healing the long-standing schism. On 19 May, a historical concelebration was held in Belgrade, by bishops of MOC and SOC, including bishops of OOA. On that occasion, archbishop Jovan (head of OOA) held a speech, expressing the support of OOA to the restoration of ecclesiastical unity. On 24 May, during the visit of Serbian Patriarch Porphyry to Skopje, the decision of SOC to recognize autocephaly of MOC was announced, and concelebration was held by hierarchs of MOC and SOC, including hierarchs of OOC. On that occasion, Patriarch emphasized in his speech that the Holy Council of Bishops (SOC) had set a task for the Synod to resolve all remaining technical and organizational issues. Some of the most important organizational issues were related to the future status of OOA, but no concrete decisions on possible organizational unification of OOA and MOC were announced. Due to those circumstances, OOA hierarchy did not attend the publication of the patriarchal tomos on the autocephaly of MOC, which was handed over in Belgrade, on 5 June. On 19 June, patriarch&#x27;s envoy Jovan (Ćulibrk), Bishop of Pakrac and Slavonia, met in Skopje with hierarchs of OOA on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of episcopal service of Bishop David (Ninov) of Stobi, but in spite of that, OOA hierarchy did not participate in any event organized by MOC on the occasion of the visit of Serbian Patriarch to North Macedonia, which took place on 20 and 21 June. 

The Assembly of the Serbian Orthodox Church announced in 20 May 2023 that it decided to integrate OOA into MOC. In 23 May, upon the decision of the Holy Assembly of Bishops of SOC, the process of integration of OOA with MOC was initiated, and OOA bishops were given canonical permission to join the jurisdiction of MOC. Further steps towards integration were made on June by the Synod of MOC, initiating the creation of new dioceses for OOA hierarchs. On 21 June, OOA hierarchs collectively joined MOC and were assigned dioceses. On 28 June, the Holy Synod of OOA made an official announcement, stating that it has fulfilled its mission, and noting that OOA hierarchs have collectively joined MOC.
